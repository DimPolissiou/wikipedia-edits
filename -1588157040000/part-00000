In 1916 during the [[First World War]], Wagener was promoted to the [[General Staff]].\n\nAfter the war, Wagener was involved in the planning of an attack against the city of Posen (now [[Pozna\u0144]], in [[Poland]]), but had to flee to the [[Baltic countries]] to avoid arrest. There he merged all ''[[Freikorps]]'' associations into the German Legion, and assumed leadership after its leader, Paul Siewert, was murdered. After returning to Germany, he was active in ''Freikorps'' operations in [[Upper Silesia]], [[Saxony]], and the [[Ruhr area]].\n\nIn 1920 he studied [[economics]] and managed to broaden his knowledge by traveling abroad. In 1929 Wagener joined the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (Nazi Party) and the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), having been recruited by his old ''Freikorps'' comrade [[Franz Pfeffer von Salomon]].<ref name=\"Kershaw\">''Kershaw'' p. 348.</ref> Wagener was able to put his business acumen and contacts to good usage for the Nazi Party, in this case for the SA:\n\n<blockquote>Wagener had used his business contacts to persuade a cigarette firm to produce [[\"Sturm\" cigarettes]] for SA men \u2013 a \"sponsorship\" deal benefiting both the firm and SA coffers. Stormtroopers were strongly encouraged to smoke only these cigarettes. A cut from the profit went to the SA ....<ref name = \"Kershaw\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe functioned as SA [[Chief of Staff]] from October 1929 through December 1930, assuming effective command of the SA for a few months in the wake of the [[Stennes Revolt]] until the assumption of command by [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] as the new Chief of Staff in early January 1931.<ref group=\"Note\">After the first Stennes Revolt in August 1930, Hitler assumed Supreme Command of the SA, having cashiered Wagener's friend and war comrade Pfeffer von Salomon as SA head. Wagener was the de facto leader of the SA from this time until R\u00f6hm's return in January 1931. See [[Stennes Revolt]].</ref> In 1933 he became a member of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]. In January 1931, Wagener led the Political-economic Department of the NSDAP, and in September 1932 he was appointed the [[F\u00fchrer]]'s personal economic advisor. Hitler appointed him Reich Commissar for the Economy from April to June 1933.<ref>''See Lambert'' p. 237.</ref>\n\nBy late 1930 or early 1931 Wagener had made a mark on National Socialist economic policy. As Patch notes (p.&nbsp;201-02):\n\n<blockquote>Wagener formulated an original set of economic policies based on corporatist and leadership principles in confidential talks with Hitler and succeeded in recruiting many middle echelon industrial managers and owners of small factories for the NSDAP....[A confidential draft by Wagener] embraced the ideal of the corporatist \"company union\" (''Werksgemeinschaft'') and described the employer as the \"Fuhrer\" within his factory. All disputes over wages and working conditions would be settled within the \"family\" of the individual company in the National Socialist state of the future. Trade unions would be responsible merely for vocational training.</blockquote>\n\nWagener was replaced in his role as Commissioner for Economic Questions by [[Wilhelm Keppler]], as Wagener had become embroiled in \"coordination\" disputes with leaders of industry after the National Socialist assumption of national power in January 1933, even forcibly occupying the industry-run trade association \"Reich Association of German Industry\" with the intention of shutting it down.<ref>''Evans'' p. 384.</ref> Internal conflicts led to legal proceedings against Wagener in 1933 and 1934 in a case brought before the [[USCHLA]] (Party tribunal). After the [[Night of the Long Knives]], Wagener was detained for a short time. Nevertheless, he was rehabilitated, and he resumed his career in the army.\n\n[[File:The Liberation of Rhodes, 1945 E30943.jpg|thumb|Wagener signs the instrument of surrender for the German forces in the [[Dodecanese]] to the British, 8 May 1945]]\nIn the [[Second World War]], Wagener served at the front, rising to the rank of [[major general]] and becoming a [[Division (military)|division commander]].

In 1916 during the [[First World War]], Wagener was promoted to the [[General Staff]].\n\nAfter the war, Wagener was involved in the planning of an attack against the city of Posen (now [[Pozna\u0144]], in [[Poland]]), but had to flee to the [[Baltic countries]] to avoid arrest. There he merged all ''[[Freikorps]]'' associations into the German Legion, and assumed leadership after its leader, Paul Siewert, was murdered. After returning to Germany, he was active in ''Freikorps'' operations in [[Upper Silesia]], [[Saxony]], and the [[Ruhr area]].\n\nIn 1920 he studied [[economics]] and managed to broaden his knowledge by traveling abroad. In 1929 Wagener joined the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (Nazi Party) and the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), having been recruited by his old ''Freikorps'' comrade [[Franz Pfeffer von Salomon]].<ref name=\"Kershaw\">''Kershaw'' p. 348.</ref> Wagener was able to put his business acumen and contacts to good usage for the Nazi Party, in this case for the SA:\n\n<blockquote>Wagener had used his business contacts to persuade a cigarette firm to produce [[\"Sturm\" cigarettes]] for SA men \u2013 a \"sponsorship\" deal benefiting both the firm and SA coffers. Stormtroopers were strongly encouraged to smoke only these cigarettes. A cut from the profit went to the SA ....<ref name = \"Kershaw\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe functioned as SA [[Chief of Staff]] from October 1929 through December 1930, assuming effective command of the SA for a few months in the wake of the [[Stennes Revolt]] until the assumption of command by [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] as the new Chief of Staff in early January 1931.<ref group=\"Note\">After the first Stennes Revolt in August 1930, Hitler assumed Supreme Command of the SA, having cashiered Wagener's friend and war comrade Pfeffer von Salomon as SA head. Wagener was the de facto leader of the SA from this time until R\u00f6hm's return in January 1931. See [[Stennes Revolt]].</ref> In 1933 he became a member of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]. In January 1931, Wagener led the Political-economic Department of the NSDAP, and in September 1932 he was appointed the [[F\u00fchrer]]'s personal economic advisor. Hitler appointed him Reich Commissar for the Economy from April to June 1933.<ref>''See Lambert'' p. 237.</ref>\n\nBy late 1930 or early 1931 Wagener had made a mark on National Socialist economic policy. As Patch notes (p.&nbsp;201-02):\n\n<blockquote>Wagener formulated an original set of economic policies based on corporatist and leadership principles in confidential talks with Hitler and succeeded in recruiting many middle echelon industrial managers and owners of small factories for the NSDAP....[A confidential draft by Wagener] embraced the ideal of the corporatist \"company union\" (''Werksgemeinschaft'') and described the employer as the \"Fuhrer\" within his factory. All disputes over wages and working conditions would be settled within the \"family\" of the individual company in the National Socialist state of the future. Trade unions would be responsible merely for vocational training.</blockquote>\n\nWagener was replaced in his role as Commissioner for Economic Questions by [[Wilhelm Keppler]], as Wagener had become embroiled in \"coordination\" disputes with leaders of industry after the National Socialist assumption of national power in January 1933, even forcibly occupying the industry-run trade association \"Reich Association of German Industry\" with the intention of shutting it down.<ref>''Evans'' p. 384.</ref> Internal conflicts led to legal proceedings against Wagener in 1933 and 1934 in a case brought before the [[USCHLA]] (Party tribunal). After the [[Night of the Long Knives]], Wagener was detained for a short time. Nevertheless, he was rehabilitated, and he resumed his career in the army.\n\n[[File:The Liberation of Rhodes, 1945 E30943.jpg|thumb|Wagener signs the instrument of surrender for the German forces in the [[Dodecanese]] to the British, 8 May 1945]]\nIn the [[Second World War]], Wagener served at the front, rising to the rank of [[major general]] and becoming a [[Division (military)|division commander]]. After the war, Wagener found himself first in [[United Kingdom|British]] and later, from 1947 to 1952, [[Italy|Italian]] [[prisoner of war camp]]s.\n\nIn 1946, while being held by the British, Wagener wrote his memoirs about Hitler and the Nazi Party's early history, entitled ''Hitler aus n\u00e4chster N\u00e4he.

In a 6-3 decision, the Court held that a Pennsylvania law forbidding the sale of various retail products on Sunday was not an unconstitutional interference with religion as described in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].\n\n==Prior history==\nPlaintiffs sought to have a 1959 Pennsylvania statute, 18 [[Purdon\u2019s Pennsylvania Statutes|Purdon's Pa. Stat. Ann.]] 4699.10 (1960 Cum. Supp.) overturned as unconstitutional.  A three judge panel rejected their petition.  (See ''Abraham Braunfeld v. Thomas J. Gibbons and Victor H. Blanc'', 184 F. Supp. 352 (E.D.Pa 1959)).\n\nThe Court also based its opinion in part on two earlier rulings.\n* In ''[[Two Guys from Harrison-Allentown, Inc., v. McGinley]]'', 366 U.S. 582 (1961), the Court had previously ruled that the same Pennsylvania statute was not unconstitutional, either as (i) a violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] or (ii) an impermissible establishment of religion under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  Therefore, the only remaining issue in ''Braunfeld'' was whether the Pennsylvania statute was an unconstitutional interference in the appellant's religion.\n* In ''[[McGowan v. Maryland]]'', 366 U.S. 420 (1961), the Court had previously held that a similar Maryland statute was constitutional.\n\n==The case==\n===Background===\nAbraham Braunfeld and the other appellants were [[Pennsylvania]] merchants.  As [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], the appellants were unable to do business on Friday evening or Saturday.  They objected to a Pennsylvania law forbidding them from doing business on Sunday, arguing that the law unfairly discriminated against them by effectively forcing them to remain closed for one more day than competing [[Christians|Christian]] merchants.\n\n===Plurality opinion===\nChief Justice [[Earl Warren|Warren]] wrote the plurality opinion, joined by Justices [[Hugo Black|Black]], [[Tom C. Clark|Clark]], and [[Charles Evans Whittaker|Whittaker]].\n* Chief Justice Warren first rejected appellants' [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] and [[Equal Protection Clause]] arguments, ruling that the Court's earlier opinion in ''Two Guys from Harrison-Allentown, Inc., v. McGinley'', 366 U.S. 582 (1961) had concluded that the statute at issue did not violate either of those provisions.  ''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 600-01.\n* Chief Justice Warren then addressed appellants' remaining argument - that by requiring Orthodox Jewish merchants to remain closed for one day in addition to their religiously required day of rest, the statute unfairly burdened existing Orthodox Jews and made it more difficult for the religion to recruit more members, thereby violating the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].  ''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 601-02.  Chief Justice Warren reasoned as follows:\n** While originally enacted for religious purposes, the so-called \"Sunday Closing Laws\" had a legitimate state purpose in providing for the general welfare by establishing a day of rest.  ''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 602-03, citing ''McGowan'', 366 U.S. at 437-40.\n** Although the Court had previously held that the Free Exercise Clause prevented the States from passing laws that forbade the exercise of religion or required citizens to \"say or believe anything in conflict with [their] religious tenets,\" states could in some cases regulate ''conduct'', even if that regulation burdened citizens of a particular religion.  ''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 603-05.\n** In order to balance the interests at issue, the Court held that:\n::# Where the \"purpose or effect of a law is to impede the observance of one or all religions or is to discriminate invidiously between religions, that law is constitutionally invalid even though the burden may be characterized as being only indirect.\"  ''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 607.\n::# However, where \"the State regulates conduct by enacting a general law within its power, the purpose and effect of which is to advance the State's secular goals, the statute is valid despite its indirect burden on religious observance unless the State may accomplish its purpose by means which do not impose such a burden.\"  ''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 607.\n** In the specific case before the Court, the plurality opinion held that the law in question had only an indirect effect, and that the Court could not conclude that there was any less burdensome means of achieving the State's goals.  In particular, although appellants argued that a law exempting citizens who were required to rest on other days from the Sunday rest day would be a wiser choice, the Court concluded that there were valid reasons for which a state might choose a single day of rest.  ''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 607-09.\n\n===Concurrence/dissent (Frankfurter)===\nJustice [[Felix Frankfurter|Frankfurter]] wrote a concurring opinion with which Justice Harlan joined as to most points.  (Justice Frankfurter published that opinion as part of ''[[McGowan v. Maryland]]'', 366 U.S. 420 (1961), but declared his opinion applicable to ''Braunfeld'' and several other cases.  ''McGowan'', 366 U.S. at 459, fn).\n* First, Justice Frankfurter examined the history of the First Amendment and \"Sunday Statutes\" in detail, and concluded that the Sunday statutes had a long history and substantial non-religious purpose.  ''McGowan'', 366 U.S. at 460-511.\n* On that basis, Justice Frankfurter rejected most of  the appellants' claims.  ''McGowan'', 366 U.S. at 511-42.\n* However, Justice Frankfurter, writing solely for himself and not for Justice Harlan, did dissent on one point.  Based on the procedural history of ''Braunfeld'', Justice Frankfurter argued that appellants' claim that the law was irrational and arbitrary should not have been dismissed for failure to state a claim, but should have been permitted to proceed to an evidentiary stage.  ''McGowan'', 366 U.S. at 542-43.\n\n===Concurrence/dissent (Brennan)===\nIn his opinion, Justice [[William J. Brennan Jr.|Brennan]] concurred in the plurality opinion to the extent that it held that the Pennsylvania statute did not violate the Establishment Clause or the Equal Protection Clause, but dissented from the remainder of the opinion, arguing that the statute should be held unconstitutional under the Free Exercise Clause.\nJustice Brennan wrote in part:\n<blockquote>[T]he issue in this case - and we do not understand either appellees or the Court to contend otherwise - is whether a State may put an individual to a choice between his business and his religion. The Court today holds that it may. But I dissent, believing that such a law prohibits the free exercise of religion.</blockquote>\nTwo years later, Justice Brennan wrote a majority opinion, in ''[[Sherbert v. Verner]]'', that largely tracked his dissent in this case.  In the Sherbert case, the court struck down a law on Free Exercise grounds that prohibited a worker from collecting unemployment compensation who was terminated from her job because she would not work on Saturdays for religious reasons.   \n\n===Dissent (Douglas)===\nLike Justice Frankfurter, Justice [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]] also published his ''Braunfeld'' dissent as part of the earlier ''McGowan'' decision, at 366 US 561-82.  In that opinion, Justice Douglas argued that the \"Sunday Laws\" could not be separated from their religious roots, and that the imposition of those laws on persons of other religions violated both the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution\n\n===Dissent (Stewart)===\nJustice [[Potter Stewart|Stewart]] joined Justice Brennan's dissent, and wrote further:\n<blockquote>Pennsylvania has passed a law which compels an Orthodox Jew to choose between his religious faith and his economic survival. That is a cruel choice. It is a choice which I think no State can constitutionally demand. For me this is not something that can be swept under the rug and forgotten in the interest of enforced Sunday togetherness. I think the impact of this law upon these appellants grossly violates their constitutional right to the free exercise of their religion.</blockquote>\n''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 616.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 366]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |title=The Constitution & Religion: Leading Supreme Court Cases on Church and State |last=Alley |first=Robert S. |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, NY |isbn=978-1-57392-703-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/constitutionreli0000unse/page/437 437&ndash;444] |url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionreli0000unse/page/437 }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{caselaw source\n | case=''Braunfeld v.

They objected to a Pennsylvania law forbidding them from doing business on Sunday, arguing that the law unfairly discriminated against them by effectively forcing them to remain closed for one more day than competing [[Christians|Christian]] merchants.\n\n===Plurality opinion===\nChief Justice [[Earl Warren|Warren]] wrote the plurality opinion, joined by Justices [[Hugo Black|Black]], [[Tom C. Clark|Clark]], and [[Charles Evans Whittaker|Whittaker]].\n* Chief Justice Warren first rejected appellants' [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] and [[Equal Protection Clause]] arguments, ruling that the Court's earlier opinion in ''Two Guys from Harrison-Allentown, Inc., v. McGinley'', 366 U.S. 582 (1961) had concluded that the statute at issue did not violate either of those provisions.  ''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 600-01.\n* Chief Justice Warren then addressed appellants' remaining argument - that by requiring Orthodox Jewish merchants to remain closed for one day in addition to their religiously required day of rest, the statute unfairly burdened existing Orthodox Jews and made it more difficult for the religion to recruit more members, thereby violating the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].  ''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 601-02.  Chief Justice Warren reasoned as follows:\n** While originally enacted for religious purposes, the so-called \"Sunday Closing Laws\" had a legitimate state purpose in providing for the general welfare by establishing a day of rest.  ''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 602-03, citing ''McGowan'', 366 U.S. at 437-40.\n** Although the Court had previously held that the Free Exercise Clause prevented the States from passing laws that forbade the exercise of religion or required citizens to \"say or believe anything in conflict with [[their]] religious tenets,\" states could in some cases regulate ''conduct'', even if that regulation burdened citizens of a particular religion.  ''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 603-05.\n** In order to balance the interests at issue, the Court held that:\n::# Where the \"purpose or effect of a law is to impede the observance of one or all religions or is to discriminate invidiously between religions, that law is constitutionally invalid even though the burden may be characterized as being only indirect.\"  ''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 607.\n::# However, where \"the State regulates conduct by enacting a general law within its power, the purpose and effect of which is to advance the State's secular goals, the statute is valid despite its indirect burden on religious observance unless the State may accomplish its purpose by means which do not impose such a burden.\"  ''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 607.\n** In the specific case before the Court, the plurality opinion held that the law in question had only an indirect effect, and that the Court could not conclude that there was any less burdensome means of achieving the State's goals.  In particular, although appellants argued that a law exempting citizens who were required to rest on other days from the Sunday rest day would be a wiser choice, the Court concluded that there were valid reasons for which a state might choose a single day of rest.  ''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 607-09.\n\n===Concurrence/dissent (Frankfurter)===\nJustice [[Felix Frankfurter|Frankfurter]] wrote a concurring opinion with which Justice Harlan joined as to most points.  (Justice Frankfurter published that opinion as part of ''[[McGowan v. Maryland]]'', 366 U.S. 420 (1961), but declared his opinion applicable to ''Braunfeld'' and several other cases.  ''McGowan'', 366 U.S. at 459, fn).\n* First, Justice Frankfurter examined the history of the First Amendment and \"Sunday Statutes\" in detail, and concluded that the Sunday statutes had a long history and substantial non-religious purpose.  ''McGowan'', 366 U.S. at 460-511.\n* On that basis, Justice Frankfurter rejected most of  the appellants' claims.  ''McGowan'', 366 U.S. at 511-42.\n* However, Justice Frankfurter, writing solely for himself and not for Justice Harlan, did dissent on one point.  Based on the procedural history of ''Braunfeld'', Justice Frankfurter argued that appellants' claim that the law was irrational and arbitrary should not have been dismissed for failure to state a claim, but should have been permitted to proceed to an evidentiary stage.  ''McGowan'', 366 U.S. at 542-43.\n\n===Concurrence/dissent (Brennan)===\nIn his opinion, Justice [[William J. Brennan Jr.|Brennan]] concurred in the plurality opinion to the extent that it held that the Pennsylvania statute did not violate the Establishment Clause or the Equal Protection Clause, but dissented from the remainder of the opinion, arguing that the statute should be held unconstitutional under the Free Exercise Clause.\nJustice Brennan wrote in part:\n<blockquote>[T]he issue in this case - and we do not understand either appellees or the Court to contend otherwise - is whether a State may put an individual to a choice between his business and his religion. The Court today holds that it may. But I dissent, believing that such a law prohibits the free exercise of religion.</blockquote>\nTwo years later, Justice Brennan wrote a majority opinion, in ''[[Sherbert v. Verner]]'', that largely tracked his dissent in this case.  In the Sherbert case, the court struck down a law on Free Exercise grounds that prohibited a worker from collecting unemployment compensation who was terminated from her job because she would not work on Saturdays for religious reasons.   \n\n===Dissent (Douglas)===\nLike Justice Frankfurter, Justice [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]] also published his ''Braunfeld'' dissent as part of the earlier ''McGowan'' decision, at 366 US 561-82.  In that opinion, Justice Douglas argued that the \"Sunday Laws\" could not be separated from their religious roots, and that the imposition of those laws on persons of other religions violated both the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution\n\n===Dissent (Stewart)===\nJustice [[Potter Stewart|Stewart]] joined Justice Brennan's dissent, and wrote further:\n<blockquote>Pennsylvania has passed a law which compels an Orthodox Jew to choose between his religious faith and his economic survival. That is a cruel choice. It is a choice which I think no State can constitutionally demand. For me this is not something that can be swept under the rug and forgotten in the interest of enforced Sunday togetherness. I think the impact of this law upon these appellants grossly violates their constitutional right to the free exercise of their religion.</blockquote>\n''Braunfeld'', 366 U.S. at 616.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 366]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |title=The Constitution & Religion: Leading Supreme Court Cases on Church and State |last=Alley |first=Robert S. |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, NY |isbn=978-1-57392-703-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/constitutionreli0000unse/page/437 437&ndash;444] |url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionreli0000unse/page/437 }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{caselaw source\n | case=''Braunfeld v.

It is the northernmost coastal town in Angus and developed as a natural harbour that traded in skins, hides and cured salmon in medieval times.\n\nWith a population of approximately 12,000, the town functions as a port, but the major employer is [[GlaxoSmithKline]], which was saved from closure in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contractorsunlimited.co.uk/news/060406-glaxosmithkline.shtml|title=GlaxoSmithKline - Montrose Plant|author=|date=|website=www.contractorsunlimited.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> The skyline of Montrose is dominated by the {{convert|220|ft|m|adj=on}} [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]] of [[Montrose Old and St Andrew's Church|Old and St Andrew's Church]], designed by [[James Gillespie Graham]] and built between 1832 and 1834.\n\nMontrose is a town with a wealth of architecture, and is a centre for international trade.

Michael Hogan, ''Stone of Morphie'', 2007, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham]</ref> One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p1</ref> Early place names appear to show the presence of a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in the area of the present harbour. The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived.

The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion.
