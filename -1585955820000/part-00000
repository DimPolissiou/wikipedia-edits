The war was part of the [[Great Game]] between the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Russian empire]]s.\n\nThe war was split into two campaigns - the first began in November 1878 with the [[British Raj|British]] invasion of Afghanistan. The British were quickly victorious and forced the [[Amir]] - [[Sher Ali Khan]] to flee. Ali's successor [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan]] immediately sued for peace and the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] was then signed on 26 May 1879. The British sent an envoy and mission led by Sir [[Louis Cavagnari]] to Kabul but on 3 September this mission was massacred and the conflict was reignited by [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] which led to the [[abdication]] of Yaqub.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Yakub Khan |volume=28 |page=898}}</ref>\n\nThe second campaign ended in September 1880 when the British [[Battle of Kandahar|decisively defeated]] Ayub Khan outside [[Kandahar]]. A new Amir - [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] selected by the British, ratified and confirmed the Gandamak treaty once more. When the British and Indian soldiers had withdrawn, the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives, as well as create a buffer between the [[British Raj]] and the Russian Empire.<ref name=\"Barfield145\">Barfield p. 145</ref>\n\n==Background==\nAfter tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]], Russia turned its attention to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. [[Sher Ali Khan]], the [[Amir of Afghanistan]], tried unsuccessfully to keep them out. Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878, and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too.<ref name=Barthorp66_67>{{cite book |last=Barthorp |first=Michael |title=Afghan Wars and the North-West Frontier 1839\u20131947|origyear=1982 |year=2002 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=0-304-36294-8 |pages=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe Amir not only refused to receive a British mission under [[Neville Bowles Chamberlain]], but threatened to stop it if it were dispatched. [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], the [[viceroy of India]], ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for Kabul in September 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the [[Khyber Pass]], triggering the Second Anglo\u2013Afghan War.<ref name=Barthorp66_67/>\n\n==War==\n===First phase===\nThe first campaign began in November 1878 when a British force of about 50,000 fighting men, mostly Indians, was distributed into three military columns which penetrated Afghanistan at three different points. The British victories at the [[Battle of Ali Masjid]] and the [[Battle of Peiwar Kotal]] meant that the approach to Kabul was left virtually undefended by Afghan troops.<ref>[http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armycampaigns/indiancampaigns/campafghan1878.htm Afghanistan 1878-1880 The Build-Up to Conflict] at britishempire.co.uk</ref>\n\nAn alarmed [[Sher Ali Khan|Sher Ali]] attempted to appeal in person to the Russian Tsar for assistance, but their insistence was that he should seek terms of surrender from the British.<ref>Sinhai, Damodar Prasad. \"India and Afghanistan, 1876\", p. 183.</ref> He returned to [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], where he died on 21 February 1879.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hanna|first=Henry Bathurst|title=The Second Afghan War, 1878-79-80: Its Causes, Its Conduct and Its Consequences|publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|year=1904|volume=2|pages=150\u2013155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzQoAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Treaty===\nWith British forces occupying much of the country, Sher Ali's son and successor, [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan]], signed the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] in May 1879 to prevent a British invasion of the rest of the country. According to this agreement and in return for an annual subsidy and vague assurances of assistance in case of foreign aggression, Yaqub relinquished control of Afghan foreign affairs to Britain. British representatives were installed in Kabul and other locations, British control was extended to the [[Khyber Pass|Khyber]] and [[Michni Pass|Michni]] passes, and Afghanistan ceded various [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u201355)|North-West Frontier Province]] [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)|areas]] and [[Quetta]] to Britain.

Yaqub Khan, suspected of complicity in the massacre of Cavagnari and his staff, was obliged to abdicate. The British considered a number of possible political settlements, including partitioning Afghanistan between multiple rulers or placing Yaqub's brother [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] on the throne, but ultimately decided to install his cousin [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] as emir instead.<ref name=Wilkinson16_17>{{cite book |last=Wilkinson-Latham |first=Robert |origyear=1977 |year=1998|title=North-West Frontier 1837\u20131947 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-85045-275-9 |pages=16\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Barthorp |first=Michael |title=Afghan Wars and the North-West Frontier 1839\u20131947|origyear=1982 |year=2002 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=0-304-36294-8 |pages=81\u201385}}</ref>\n[[File:Coin minted in Kandahar during its occupation during the Second Anglo-Afghan War.jpg|thumb|A rare coin minted during the occupation of Kandahar.

The war was part of the [[Great Game]] between the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Russian empire]]s.\n\nThe war was split into two campaigns - the first began in November 1878 with the [[British Raj|British]] invasion of Afghanistan. The British were quickly victorious and forced the [[Amir]] - [[Sher Ali Khan]] to flee. Ali's successor [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan]] immediately sued for peace and the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] was then signed on 26 May 1879. The British sent an envoy and mission led by Sir [[Louis Cavagnari]] to Kabul but on 3 September this mission was massacred and the conflict was reignited by [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] which led to the [[abdication]] of Yaqub.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Yakub Khan |volume=28 |page=898}}</ref>\n\nThe second campaign ended in September 1880 when the British [[Battle of Kandahar|decisively defeated]] Ayub Khan outside [[Kandahar]]. A new Amir - [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] selected by the British, ratified and confirmed the Gandamak treaty once more. When the British and Indian soldiers had withdrawn, the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives, as well as create a buffer between the [[British Raj]] and the Russian Empire.<ref name=\"Barfield145\">Barfield p. 145</ref>\n\n==Background==\nAfter tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]], Russia turned its attention to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. [[Sher Ali Khan]], the [[Amir of Afghanistan]], tried unsuccessfully to keep them out. Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878, and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too.<ref name=Barthorp66_67>{{cite book |last=Barthorp |first=Michael |title=Afghan Wars and the North-West Frontier 1839\u20131947|origyear=1982 |year=2002 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=0-304-36294-8 |pages=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe Amir not only refused to receive a British mission under [[Neville Bowles Chamberlain]], but threatened to stop it if it were dispatched. [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], the [[viceroy of India]], ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for Kabul in September 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the [[Khyber Pass]], triggering the Second Anglo\u2013Afghan War.<ref name=Barthorp66_67/>\n\n==War==\n===First phase===\nThe first campaign began in November 1878 when a British force of about 50,000 fighting men, mostly Indians, was distributed into three military columns which penetrated Afghanistan at three different points. The British victories at the [[Battle of Ali Masjid]] and the [[Battle of Peiwar Kotal]] meant that the approach to Kabul was left virtually undefended by Afghan troops.<ref>[http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armycampaigns/indiancampaigns/campafghan1878.htm Afghanistan 1878-1880 The Build-Up to Conflict] at britishempire.co.uk</ref>\n\nAn alarmed [[Sher Ali Khan|Sher Ali]] attempted to appeal in person to the Russian Tsar for assistance, but their insistence was that he should seek terms of surrender from the British.<ref>Sinhai, Damodar Prasad. \"India and Afghanistan, 1876\", p. 183.</ref> He returned to [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], where he died on 21 February 1879.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hanna|first=Henry Bathurst|title=The Second Afghan War, 1878-79-80: Its Causes, Its Conduct and Its Consequences|publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|year=1904|volume=2|pages=150\u2013155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzQoAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Treaty===\nWith British forces occupying much of the country, Sher Ali's son and successor, [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan]], signed the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] in May 1879 to prevent a British invasion of the rest of the country. According to this agreement and in return for an annual subsidy and vague assurances of assistance in case of foreign aggression, Yaqub relinquished control of Afghan foreign affairs to Britain. British representatives were installed in Kabul and other locations, British control was extended to the [[Khyber Pass|Khyber]] and [[Michni Pass|Michni]] passes, and Afghanistan ceded various [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u201355)|North-West Frontier Province]] [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)|areas]] and [[Quetta]] to Britain.

Yaqub Khan, suspected of complicity in the massacre of Cavagnari and his staff, was obliged to abdicate. The British considered a number of possible political settlements, including partitioning Afghanistan between multiple rulers or placing Yaqub's brother [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] on the throne, but ultimately decided to install his cousin [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] as emir instead.<ref name=Wilkinson16_17>{{cite book |last=Wilkinson-Latham |first=Robert |origyear=1977 |year=1998|title=North-West Frontier 1837\u20131947 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-85045-275-9 |pages=16\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Barthorp |first=Michael |title=Afghan Wars and the North-West Frontier 1839\u20131947|origyear=1982 |year=2002 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=0-304-36294-8 |pages=81\u201385}}</ref>\n[[File:Coin minted in Kandahar during its occupation during the Second Anglo-Afghan War.jpg|thumb|A rare coin minted during the occupation of Kandahar.

{"title_page": "The Wool Road (New South Wales)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n'''The Wool Road''' (also later known as 'The Old Wool Road') was a [[Historic roads|historic road]] of New South Wales, Australia, that ran from [[Nerriga, New South Wales|Nerriga]] to what is now [[Vincentia, New South Wales|Vincentia]] on [[Jervis Bay]]. It was constructed privately in 1841, using convict labour. Its purpose was to provide a shorter route to a seaport for wool grown at [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]] and beyond.\n\nThe historical significance of The Wool Road is that it was the first road, capable of being used by wheeled vehicles, linking the inland area around [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]] to the [[South Coast (New South Wales)|South Coast]]. The road led to the foundation of the privately-owned port town of South Huskisson (called [[Vincentia, New South Wales|Vincentia]] since 1952) and the adjacent 'government townshIp' of [[Huskisson, New South Wales|Huskisson]].\n\nThe Wool Road's route made its use difficult and the port on Jervis Bay was not a success. In 1856, the original road was realigned and extended to [[Terara]] (near [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]]) instead of Jervis Bay, becoming the Braidwood Road. The old route through the coastal escarpment to Jervis Bay fell into disuse for many years.\n\nMuch of the original route of The Wool Road remains in use today but some parts are accessible only to four-wheel drive traffic. Only a part of the original route that is currently in use is known as The Wool Road or The Old Wool Road today\u2014the section from the Princes Highway to Vincentia. The remainder of the original route still in use today is made up of a significant part of the Braidwood Road (MR92), Wandean Road, and a short section of the Princes Highway.\n\n== Historical context ==\n[[File:Wandandian tool-sharpening grooves near Wool Road route outside Vincentia (April 2019).jpg|thumb|282x282px|Tool-sharpening groves made by  Wandandian people, in sandstone rock nearby the route of The Wool Road, outside Vincentia, N.S.W.

In the 1830s and 1840s, the Wandandian people still lived on their traditional lands.\n\nThe land also lay within the [[St Vincent County|County of St. Vincent]], one of the [[Nineteen Counties]] in which white settlement was permitted by the colonial government of New South Wales. In the late 1820s and 1830s colonial settlement had spread to the vicinity of [[Lake George (New South Wales)|Lake George]], [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]], [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]], the Limestone Plains (now [[Canberra]]), and beyond to the [[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro district]]. The country settled was well-suited for the production of wool, for which there was a booming export market, but lay far from the existing port of Sydney. Transporting the [[wool bale]]s using the cumbersome [[Bullocky|bullock drays]] of the time involved a long and arduous journey from Braidwood\u2014taking around three weeks at the bullock's slow pace and with their need to stop for rest, feeding and watering\u2014via [[Bungonia, New South Wales|Bungonia]] and [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] to Sydney. The owner of [[Government House, Canberra#History of the site|Yarralumla]], [[Terence Aubrey Murray|Terence Murray]], further away at the Limestone Plains, complained that, in wet weather, the drays could take as long as three months to reach Sydney.<ref>{{Citation|last=Wilson|first=Gwendoline|title=Murray, Sir Terence Aubrey (1810\u20131873)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/murray-sir-terence-aubrey-2498|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=2018-12-11}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1830s, a bridle-track known as the Corn Trail was made, from [[Clyde Mountain]] to the coastal [[Buckenbowra River|Buckenbowra Valley]], but it was steep and only usable by pack horses. Transport of wool in [[Wool bale|bales]] required a road that could be used by bullock drays.\n\nJervis Bay, a large sheltered bay that was suitable as a deepwater port lay far closer than Sydney but there was no road from Braidwood toward the coast beyond Nerriga. From 1831, there were sea-going auxiliary steamships\u2014such as the ''[[Sophia Jane]]''\u2014operating in New South Wales but steam powered railways were not in place before the mid-1850s.\n\nAlthough transportation of [[Convicts in Australia|convicts]] to New South Wales had ceased in 1840, it was still a penal colony. Convicts were a workforce that could be put to work on roadmaking.\n\n== Route ==\n[[File:Tianjara Creek looking north from Tianjara falls.jpg|thumb|209x209px|The valley of Tianjara Creek, looking north from Tianjara Falls. The  Wool Road passed south of the top of the falls to avoid this valley and the nearby valley of the Clyde River.]]\nThe endpoints of The Wool Road were the village of [[Nerriga, New South Wales|Nerriga]]\u2014by 1841 already connected to Braidwood by a rudimentary road\u2014and the newly created port of South Huskisson (later known as 'the old township' and today known as [[Vincentia, New South Wales|Vincentia]]) on Jervis Bay. The significant geographical obstacles to be overcome were crossing the [[Endrick River]] near Nerriga, climbing to a plateau in the northern part of the Pigeon House Range, then avoiding the steep valleys and gorges cut into that plateau by tributaries of the [[Shoalhaven River|Shoalhaven]] and [[Clyde River (New South Wales)|Clyde]] rivers, and subsequently descending from the plateau to the coastal plain to reach Jervis Bay.\n\nAfter fording the Endrick River, The Wool Road broadly followed the direction of the modern-day Braidwood Road (MR92), from Nerriga to near the Boolijah Peak, a point east of [[Sassafras, New South Wales|Sassafras]]. The current Braidwood Road alignment is the result of an upgrade in 1856. The original 1841 road's exact route was different in some places, most significantly where it climbs the Pigeon House Range at Bulee Mountain near Nerriga. The 1841 road traversed the ridge to the north of Bulee Mountain and went through the man-made Bulee Gap,<ref name=\":5\" />  whereas the 1856 alignment and the current road pass to the south of Bulee Mountain[[File:Sussex Inlet from Jerrawangala lookout.jpg|thumb|View from Jerrawangala lookout atop the coastal escarpment approx. 500m south of Wandean Gap.

Soon after the road opened, in January 1842, an anonymous report of difficulties using it appeared, which included a prediction that, ''\"it is doubtful if ever it will be completed and when finished, a constant thoroughfare to the sea coast; inasmuch as the route is chiefly barren scrub, and badly watered.\"''<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article226356874|title=COUNTRY NEWS.|date=1842-01-08|work=Sydney Free Press (NSW : 1841 - 1842)|access-date=2019-02-02|pages=2}}</ref> A year later, in January 1843, an article in the [[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]] stated that, ''\"The township, the wharf, and the road, have all still to contend against the evil reports which have been so industriously clrculated respecting them by interested parties\"''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12413192|title=&quot;JERVIS BAY.|date=1843-01-11|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-12-09|pages=2}}</ref> There was some factual basis for such negative views.\n\nGeographic and economic difficulties affected The Wool Road and these, rather than the 'evil reports', caused it to fall into disuse after a relatively short time.\n\nThe steep descent proved a problem for the cumbersome [[Bullocky|bullock drays]] of the day. Although the distance was short, the slowness of the fully laden bullock drays descending the steep route led to ships being delayed at Jervis Bay and on at least one occasion leaving without taking on a cargo there. With hindsight, the route of The Wool Road via the Wandean Gap had been a poor choice; far better routes for roads over the coastal escarpment would be found later.\n\nThe truth about the road\u2014and the country through which it ran\u2014was very much contrary to the apparently exaggerated claims that had been made, when town allotments in South Huskisson had been sold for high prices in 1841.<ref name=\":15\" /> The country atop the Pidgeon House Range was infertile land that was unsuitable to provide grazing for the bullock teams, with the exception of the natural clearing at Yerock (or Yarrock) Flat\u2014known as McKenzie's Paddock<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sassafras : the story of the Post Town at Sassafras Mountain on the old Wool Road in the County of St. Vincent|last=Charles.|first=Snedden, Robert|date=1996|publisher=R C Snedden|isbn=0646259822|location=Duffy, A.C.T.|pages=22 & 24|oclc=38411506}}</ref>\u2014and the nearby area of volcanic soil around [[Sassafras, New South Wales|Sassafras]].

It was constructed privately in 1841, using convict labour. Its purpose was to provide a shorter route to a seaport for wool grown at [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]] and beyond.\n\nThe historical significance of The Wool Road is that it was the first road, capable of being used by wheeled vehicles, linking the inland area around [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]] to the [[South Coast (New South Wales)|South Coast]]. The road led to the foundation of the privately-owned port town of South Huskisson (called [[Vincentia, New South Wales|Vincentia]] since 1952) and the adjacent 'government townshIp' of [[Huskisson, New South Wales|Huskisson]].\n\nThe Wool Road's route made its use difficult and the port on Jervis Bay was not a success. In 1856, the original road was realigned and extended to [[Terara]] (near [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]]) instead of Jervis Bay, becoming the Braidwood Road. The old route through the coastal escarpment to Jervis Bay fell into disuse for many years.\n\nMuch of the original route of The Wool Road remains in use today but some parts are accessible only to four-wheel drive traffic. Only a part of the original route that is currently in use is known as The Wool Road or The Old Wool Road today\u2014the section from the Princes Highway to Vincentia.

In the 1830s and 1840s, the Wandandian people still lived on their traditional lands.\n\nThe land also lay within the [[St Vincent County|County of St. Vincent]], one of the [[Nineteen Counties]] in which white settlement was permitted by the colonial government of New South Wales. In the late 1820s and 1830s colonial settlement had spread to the vicinity of [[Lake George (New South Wales)|Lake George]], [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]], [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]], the Limestone Plains (now [[Canberra]]), and beyond to the [[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro district]]. The country settled was well-suited for the production of wool, for which there was a booming export market, but lay far from the existing port of Sydney. Transporting the [[wool bale]]s using the cumbersome [[Bullocky|bullock drays]] of the time involved a long and arduous journey from Braidwood\u2014taking around three weeks at the bullock's slow pace and with their need to stop for rest, feeding and watering\u2014via [[Bungonia, New South Wales|Bungonia]] and [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] to Sydney.

Transport of wool in [[Wool bale|bales]] required a road that could be used by bullock drays.\n\nJervis Bay, a large sheltered bay that was suitable as a deepwater port lay far closer than Sydney but there was no road from Braidwood toward the coast beyond Nerriga. From 1831, there were sea-going auxiliary steamships\u2014such as the ''[[Sophia Jane]]''\u2014operating in New South Wales but steam powered railways were not in place before the mid-1850s.\n\nAlthough transportation of [[Convicts in Australia|convicts]] to New South Wales had ceased in 1840, it was still a penal colony.

The significant geographical obstacles to be overcome were crossing the [[Endrick River]] near Nerriga, climbing to a plateau in the northern part of the Pigeon House Range, then avoiding the steep valleys and gorges cut into that plateau by tributaries of the [[Shoalhaven River|Shoalhaven]] and [[Clyde River (New South Wales)|Clyde]] rivers, and subsequently descending from the plateau to the coastal plain to reach Jervis Bay.\n\nAfter fording the Endrick River, The Wool Road broadly followed the direction of the modern-day Braidwood Road (MR92), from Nerriga to near the Boolijah Peak, a point east of [[Sassafras, New South Wales|Sassafras]].

The original 1841 road's exact route was different in some places, most significantly where it climbs the Pigeon House Range at Bulee Mountain near Nerriga.

Soon after the road opened, in January 1842, an anonymous report of difficulties using it appeared, which included a prediction that, ''\"it is doubtful if ever it will be completed and when finished, a constant thoroughfare to the sea coast; inasmuch as the route is chiefly barren scrub, and badly watered.\"''<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article226356874|title=COUNTRY NEWS.|date=1842-01-08|work=Sydney Free Press (NSW : 1841 - 1842)|access-date=2019-02-02|pages=2}}</ref> A year later, in January 1843, an article in the [[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]] stated that, ''\"The township, the wharf, and the road, have all still to contend against the evil reports which have been so industriously clrculated respecting them by interested parties\"''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12413192|title=&quot;JERVIS BAY.|date=1843-01-11|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-12-09|pages=2}}</ref> There was some factual basis for such negative views.\n\nGeographic and economic difficulties affected The Wool Road and these, rather than the 'evil reports', caused it to fall into disuse after a relatively short time.\n\nThe steep descent proved a problem for the cumbersome [[Bullocky|bullock drays]] of the day. Although the distance was short, the slowness of the fully laden bullock drays descending the steep route led to ships being delayed at Jervis Bay and on at least one occasion leaving without taking on a cargo there.

Farrar and Tweedy agreed to a final Uncle Tupelo tour, but the concerts were marred by the two not participating in each other's songs.

Tweedy was indifferent to the idea of working with Bragg, but Jay Bennett's enthusiasm about the idea convinced Tweedy to get the band involved in the project. As a result of Tweedy's feelings on the political nature of some of the lyrics, Bragg recorded mostly political songs while Wilco recorded more neutral songs.

Tweedy chose [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]] based on his fascination with O'Rourke's ''[[Bad Timing (Jim O'Rourke album)|Bad Timing]]'' album. O'Rourke offered to bring drummer [[Glenn Kotche]] to the festival, and the trio formed a side project named [[Loose Fur]]. The other band members of Wilco had written a number of songs for ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'', but Tweedy was unsatisfied with them because he believed that the songs did not sound like the ones he played with Loose Fur.

Tweedy was enraged that Farrar decided to break up the band without notifying him, and this led to a series of harsh verbal exchanges. Farrar and Tweedy agreed to a final Uncle Tupelo tour, but the concerts were marred by the two not participating in each other's songs. The band decided to play Tweedy's \"The Long Cut\" on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', which further distanced Farrar and Tweedy.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|80\u201384}} Farrar began to assemble a new band named [[Son Volt]] with Mike Heidorn, bassist Jim Boquist, and his brother Dave Boquist.

Tweedy was indifferent to the idea of working with Bragg, but Jay Bennett's enthusiasm about the idea convinced Tweedy to get the band involved in the project. As a result of Tweedy's feelings on the political nature of some of the lyrics, Bragg recorded mostly political songs while Wilco recorded more neutral songs.

Tweedy chose [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]] based on his fascination with O'Rourke's ''[[Bad Timing (Jim O'Rourke album)|Bad Timing]]'' album. O'Rourke offered to bring drummer [[Glenn Kotche]] to the festival, and the trio formed a side project named [[Loose Fur]]. The other band members of Wilco had written a number of songs for ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'', but Tweedy was unsatisfied with them because he believed that the songs did not sound like the ones he played with Loose Fur. Tweedy became such a fan of Kotche's playing style that he decided to dismiss Ken Coomer from the band in favor of Kotche.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|176\u2013183,188}} Tweedy had strong feelings about how songs should be sequenced, which clashed with Jay Bennett's focus on the songs themselves. Because Bennett was mixing the album, this led to a series of arguments between songs about how the album should sound. Tweedy asked O'Rourke to remix several songs on the album that had been mixed by Bennett, which caused tensions within the band to escalate.
