The courtrooms date back to the 14th century and the gaol to at least 1449.\n\nThe building is a [[Grade II*]] [[listed building]] and the museum is a registered charity.<ref name=\"listed\">{{National Heritage List for England|num=1254517|desc=Shire Hall and adjoining county gaol, High Pavement, Nottingham|accessdate=13 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Charity commission\">{{cite web|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1030554&SubsidiaryNumber=0|title=1030554|publisher=Charity Commission|accessdate=26 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe earliest confirmed use of the site for official purposes was by the Normans, who appointed sheriffs to keep the peace and collect taxes; hence the site was sometimes referred to as the Sheriff's Hall, the County Hall or the King's Hall.\n\nThe first written record of the site being used as a law court dates from 1375.
