They were interviewed in 2005 for the \"Big Break\" episode of [[Public Radio International|PRI]] radio program ''[[This American Life]],'' regarding their Beatles-Sullivan experience, including a dressing room encounter with [[John Lennon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Human Spectacle 2015|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/568/transcript|accessdate=October 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThey were spotted in 1963 while performing together in [[Honolulu]] by the Australian television producer John Collins, who produced ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' for TCN-9 in Sydney. Collins was seeking a replacement for the then unknown Irish comedian [[Dave Allen (comedian)|Dave Allen]], who had hosted the program for the previous two seasons and wanted to return to Ireland. Collins approached them and they agreed but could not start an Australian engagement until their Hawaiian engagement was complete. They recommended an American comedian, their friend [[Don Lane]], who was also working in Hawaii, to fill in during the meantime. Collins agreed to this. Lane started his Australian engagement and was an immediate success. Ratings were sensational and the network was delighted. It was going to be difficult if not impossible to replace him once the Brills became available. When they did, the preference was obvious and their engagement was cancelled after six weeks. Lane resumed their spot and remained successful in Australian television for the ensuing thirty-five years.\n\nIn 1967, McCall and Brill had a comedy recording, ''From Our Point of View'', released by [[ABC Records]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Special Merit Picks: Comedy |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Billboard-IDX/IDX/60s/1967/Billboard%201967-04-01-OCR-Page-0036.pdf#search=%22mitzi%20mccall%22 |accessdate=23 September 2018 |work=Billboard |date=April 1, 1967 |page=40}}</ref> Later that year, the duo signed with Congressional Records.<ref>{{cite news |title=Signings |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Billboard-IDX/IDX/60s/1967/Billboard%201967-11-04-OCR-Page-0020.pdf#search=%22mitzi%20mccall%22 |accessdate=23 September 2018 |work=Billboard |date=November 4, 1967 |page=20}}</ref>\n\n=== Shawlee and McCall ===\nIn the early 1960s, McCall and actress [[Joan Shawlee]] formed a team to perform as a night club act,<ref name=\"bg\">{{cite news |title=Joan Shawlee Sparkles Like a Spring Tonic |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23940101/joan_shawlee/ |work=The Boston Globe |date=April 30, 1961 |location=Massachusetts, Boston |page=65|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 21, 2018}} {{Open access}}</ref> debuting the act at the Club Robaire in Cleveland.<ref>{{cite news |title=They're Back |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23952672/joan_shawlee_mitzi_mccall/ |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=October 20, 1960 |location=California, Los Angeles |page=54|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 22, 2018}} {{Open access}}</ref> In January 1961, syndicated newspaper columnist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] reported that the team was \"causing quite a stir\", and she cited the partners' discrepancy in height \u2014 \"Joan being six feet, three inches tall and Mitzi four feet, 10 inches short.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kilgallen |first1=Dorothy |title=The Voice of Broadway |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23952810/joan_shawlee_mitzi_mccall/ |work=The Mercury |date=January 7, 1961 |location=Pennsylvania, Pottstown |page=4|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 22, 2018}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, McCall had a supporting role as Bonnie in the film ''[[World's Greatest Dad]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn the early 1950s, McCall was married to Jack Tolen, a television director and production manager.<ref name=\"ppg\">{{cite news |last1=Fanning |first1=Win |title=Radio-Television |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23954040/mitzi_mccall/ |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=June 29, 1954 |location=Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh |page=25|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 22, 2018}} {{Open access}}</ref> She and Charlie Brill met in 1959 and married the following year.<ref>California Marriage Index, 1960-1985.</ref> They have a daughter, L.A.-based yoga instructor Jenny Brill.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Films===\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* ''[[You're Never Too Young]]'' - Skeets Powell (1955)\n* ''[[Machine-Gun Kelly (film)|Machine-Gun Kelly]]'' - Harriet (uncredited) (1958)\n* ''[[War of the Satellites]]'' - Mitzi (1958)\n* ''[[The Cry Baby Killer]]'' - Evelyn (1958)\n* ''[[Deep Blood]]'' - Ben's Mother (1989)\n* ''[[White Palace (film)|White Palace]]'' - Sophie Rosen (1990)\n* ''[[The Opposite Sex and How to Live with Them]]'' - Freida Crown (1992)\n* ''[[EDtv]]'' - Fig Lady (1999)\n* ''Hard Four'' - Myrna Segal (2007)\n* ''[[World's Greatest Dad]]'' - Bonnie (2009)\n* ''[[Crimson Peak]]'' - Additional voices (2015)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Television series===\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'' - \"herself\" in \"The Fun Couple\" sketches (1968-1969)\n* ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' - Estelle Ellinger (Episode: \"Nostalgia Party\") (1974)\n* ''[[Family (1976 TV series)|Family]]'' - Sally (Episode: \"Princess in the Tower\") (1978)\n* ''[[Life Goes On (TV series)|Life Goes On]]'' - Midge (1991-1992)\n* ''[[Silk Stalkings]]'' - Fran Lipschitz (1993-1999)\n* ''[[Seinfeld]]'' - Donna (Episode: \"The Secretary\") (1994)\n* ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' - Rochelle Shapiro (Episode: \"Too Hip for the Room\") (1996)\n* ''[[Alright Already (TV series)|Alright Already]]'' - Miriam Lerner (1997-1998)\n* ''[[Caroline in the City]]'' - Lois (Episode: \"Caroline and the Little White Lies\") (1998)\n* ''[[Becker]]'' - Mrs. Gould (Episode: \"Hate Thy Neighbor\") (1999)\n* ''[[Dharma & Greg]]'' - Florence (Episode: \"With a Little Help from My Friend\") (2001)\n* ''[[The Suite Life of Zack and Cody]]'' - Doreen (Episode \"Club Twin\") (2007)\n* ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' - Woman (Episode: \"My Best Friend's Boyfriend\") (2007)\n* ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'' - Blanche (Episode: \"Chuck Versus the Broken Heart\") (2009)\n{{div col end}}\n\n====Animation====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"\n|-\n!

Set in the ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' universe, the two main games in the series, ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' (2007) and ''[[Portal 2]]'' (2011), center on a woman, [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], forced to undergo a series of tests within the Aperture Science Enrichment Center by a malicious [[artificial intelligence]], [[GLaDOS]], that controls the facility. Most of the tests involve using the \"Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\" - the \"portal gun\" - that creates a human-sized wormhole-like connection between two flat surfaces. The player-character or objects in the game world may move through portals while conserving their momentum. This allows complex \"flinging\" maneuvers to be used to cross wide gaps or perform other feats to reach the exit for each test chamber. A number of other mechanics, such as lasers, light bridges, tractor funnels and turrets, exist to aid or hinder the player's goal to reach the exit.\n\nThe ''Portal'' games are noted for bringing students and their projects from the [[DigiPen Institute of Technology]] into Valve and extending their ideas into the full games. The portal concept was introduced by the game ''[[Narbacular Drop]]'' and led to the basis for the first game. Another game, ''[[Tag: The Power of Paint]]'', formed the basis of surface-altering \"gels\" introduced in ''Portal 2''.\n\nBoth games have received near-universal praise, and have sold millions of copies. The first game was released as part of a five-game compilation, ''[[The Orange Box]]'', and though intended as a short bonus feature of the compilation, was instead considered the highlight of the five. Its success led to the creation of the much longer ''Portal 2'', which included both single player and cooperative player modes; it too received mostly positive critical reviews. In addition to the challenging puzzle elements, both games are praised for its [[black comedy|dark humor]], written by [[Erik Wolpaw]], [[Chet Faliszek]], and [[Jay Pinkerton]], voice work by actors [[Ellen McLain]], [[Stephen Merchant]], and [[J.K. Simmons]], and musical songs by [[Jonathan Coulton]]. A number of spin-off media have been developed alongside the games, and several of the game elements have become parts of [[Internet meme]]s.\n\n==Setting and characters==\n{{see also|Characters in the Portal series|Portal (video game)#Plot|Portal 2#Plot}}\n[[File:Aperture Laboratories Logo.svg|thumb|200px|right|One of the in-game logos for Aperture.]]\nBoth ''Portal'' games take place in the fictional \"Aperture Science Enrichment Center\". Aperture Science was founded by [[Cave Johnson (Portal)|Cave Johnson]] (voiced by [[J.K. Simmons]]) and originally sought to make shower curtains for the military. Its research happened upon the discovery of portal technology, and soon became a direct competitor with [[Black Mesa Research Facility]] (from the ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' series) for government funding. Johnson acquired the rights to a disused salt mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where they started building a labyrinthine set of offices, laboratories, facilities, and test chambers. During this time, Johnson became poisoned from exposure to moon dust, a key component of the paint needed for the portal technology, and became increasingly deranged.\n\nIn ''Portal 2'', the player explores these long-abandoned areas of Aperture, learning that the company had moved from testing on the country's finest, to paid volunteers, and ultimately to forcing its own employees to participate in testing. Near the point of his death, Johnson ordered his lifelong assistant Caroline (voiced by [[Ellen McLain]]) to be the first test subject for a mind-to-computer transfer; her personality would ultimately form the core of [[GLaDOS]] (also McLain). Sometime after Johnson's death, the old sections of the facility were vitrified, and a more modern facility built atop those ruins. GLaDOS was built to control the facility and monitor the tests, but researchers found that the computer had villainous tendencies, threatening to kill the entire staff before it was shut down in time. The Aperture researchers constructed a number of \"personality cores\" that would fit onto GLaDOS to prevent her from turning against them.  Despite this, on the day she was officially activated (coincidentally on \"[[Take Your Daughter to Work Day]]\"), she turned against the researchers and killed nearly everyone in the facility with lethal doses of neurotoxin gas. In the games and the comic ''Lab Rat'', one employee Doug Rattmann survived due to his schizophrenia and distrust of GLaDOS. In trying to find a way to defeat GLaDOS, he finds that [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], one of the human subjects kept in cryogenic storage within Aperture, has a high level of tenacity, and arranges for the events of ''Portal'' to occur by moving her to the top of GLaDOS' testing list. GLaDOS remains driven to test human subjects despite the lack of humans.\n\n[[File:Portal 2 character poster.jpg|thumb|right|A promotional poster created by Valve artist Tristan Reidford, showcasing the characters from ''Portal''. From center top clockwise: Chell, GLaDOS, P-Body (left) and Atlas, the turrets, Cave Johnson (in picture frame), a Companion Cube, and Wheatley]]\nThe player is introduced to Aperture in ''Portal'', which is said by Valve to be set sometime between the events of ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. The player-character Chell is awakened by GLaDOS for testing. Chell resists GLaDOS' lies and verbal ploys and succeeds to defeat GLaDOS' core, the destruction creating a portal implosion that sends Chell to the surface, unconscious. Rattmann, who has helped Chell by writing warning messages and directions to maintenance areas on the facility walls and had observed the final battle, escapes Aperture, but on witnessing a robot dragging Chell's body back inside, sacrifices his escape to assure that Chell is put into indefinite cryogenic storage. He himself is critically wounded but appears to make it to another cryogenic chamber, though his ultimate fate is not revealed.\n\n''Portal 2'' takes place numerous years after the events of the first game; the Aperture facility has fallen into disrepair without GLaDOS. A personality core named Wheatley ([[Stephen Merchant]]) wakes Chell from her sleep to help her stop a reactor failure, but inadvertently awakens GLaDOS, who had backed up her personality. Though they defeat GLaDOS by putting Wheatley in her place, Wheatley is overwhelmed with power, sending Chell and GLaDOS, temporarily reduced to a small computer powered by a potato, to the old core of Aperture, where GLaDOS rediscovers her relation to Caroline. They return to the surface where they are forced to defeat Wheatley before his ineptitude with the Aperture systems causes the facility reactors to become critical and explode. GLaDOS is returned to her rightful place and returns the facility to normal. GLaDOS then lets Chell go, realizing that the prospect of trying to kill her is too much trouble. Instead, she turns to two robots of her own creation, Atlas and P-Body, to locate a mythical store of additional human subjects kept in cryogenic sleep for her to continue testing on.\n\nIn addition to these characters, the game includes numerous laser-seeking turrets that seek to kill the player-characters, though are apologetic for it; most are voiced by McLain, though some defective ones in the sequel are voiced by [[Nolan North]]. GLaDOS introduces Chell to the \"Weighted Companion Cube\", appearing similar to other Weighed Cubes (crates) in the game, but decorated with hearts on its sides; GLaDOS attempts to make Chell believe the Companion Cube is a sentient object and a key to her survival, before making Chell dispose of it in an incinerator prior to leaving a test chamber. Both games feature other personality cores that were constructed to keep GLaDOS in check; the first game includes three cores, the Morality, Curiosity, and Intelligence Cores, voiced by McLain as well as a snarling Anger Core voiced by [[Mike Patton]].

The effort is built on a standalone \"Puzzle Maker\" that incorporates the level editor for ''Portal 2'' that was released as free content for the game in early 2012. Valve had built the Puzzle Maker with the aid of educators, as to make it suitable for lesson plans as well as making it as easy for teachers to use to construct such plans. The Puzzle Maker is not limited to physics, but designed to be modular so that other fields, such as fundamental electronics or chemistry, could be included.<ref name=\"wired schools\"/> The \"Teach with Portals\" initiative is built atop of a stripped-down version of the Steam client, \"Steam for Schools\", that is designed to be used in schools, allowing instructors to control the installation of the games and lesson plans on the students' computers.

J. Abrams]] announced that they were to collaborate on a film adaption of the ''Portal'' series.<ref>[https://www.engadget.com/2013/02/06/valve-bad-robot-games-film/ Portal and Half-Life Creator Gabe Newell teams up with Filmmaker J.

Abrams states Movies are in the script stage and are in the works]</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nSeveral elements of the ''Portal'' series have entered popular culture, typically as bases for [[Internet memes]].\n*During ''Portal'', the player explores areas outside of the test chambers where scrawled messages left by Rattmann and others warn of GLaDOS' deception.  In particular, while GLaDOS promises that Chell will receive cake for completing the training courses, the messages alert that this reward does not exist, and that \"the cake is a lie\". The phrase \"the cake is a lie\" became an Internet meme, leading to numerous cake-related jokes, as well as its adaption as a term relating to a false promise. When writing ''Portal 2'', Wolpaw stated that they were so sick of cake jokes that they purposely avoided any reference to that, save for one subtle nod.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n*In one ''Portal'' level, the player is given an inanimate weighted cube with hearts on its side, called the \"Weighted Companion Cube\" by GLaDOS. GLaDOS proceeds to taunt the player by asserting that the Cube is alive, that it is Chell's friend, and otherwise attempting to form an attraction to it. The player is required to use the Weighted Companion Cube to complete the level, but to exit the level, the player must then drop the Cube into an incinerator. The Weighted Companion Cube became a popular item to include on ''Portal''-themed merchandise.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n*''Portal''{{'s}} credit sequence plays over the song \"[[Still Alive]]\", composed by [[Jonathan Coulton]], and, in its original form, sung by Ellen McLain in the GLaDOS voice. The song, sung from GLaDOS's point of view as considering her defeat as \"a success\", contributed to the positive response of the game as well as highlight Coulton's work to players, and leading to Valve bringing back Coulton to record a credits song for ''Portal 2''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/06/07/the-best-video-game-surprise-songs.aspx | title = The Best Video Game Surprise Songs | first = Kyle | last = Hilliard | date = June 7, 2013 | accessdate = June 7, 2013 | work = [[Game Informer]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130609235334/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/06/07/the-best-video-game-surprise-songs.aspx | archivedate = June 9, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n*In 2017, a cosmetic set based on the Companion Cube was released as a visual replacement for the \"Io\" character in Valve's [[multiplayer online battle arena]] game, ''[[Dota 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Sam|title=Valve Reveals Companion Cube Cosmetic For Dota 2 Hero|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/19/valve-reveals-companion-cube-cosmetic-for-dota-2-hero|website=IGN|accessdate=20 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519033242/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/19/valve-reveals-companion-cube-cosmetic-for-dota-2-hero|archivedate=May 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|www.thinkwithportals.com}}\n\n{{Portal series}}\n{{Half-Life}}\n{{Valve}}\n\n[[Category:Portal (series)| ]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises introduced in 2007]]\n[[Category:Video games adapted into comics]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Video game series by Valve}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2017}}\n{{Infobox video game series\n| width                  = \n| title                  = Portal\n| collapsible            = \n| state                  =\n| image                  = Portal logo.png\n| caption                = Logo for the first game\n| platforms              = [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]]\n| developer              = [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]\n| publisher              = Valve\n| first release version  = ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]''\n| first release date     = October 10, 2007\n| latest release version = ''[[Portal 2]]''\n| latest release date    = April 19, 2011\n| genre                  = [[Puzzle-platform]]\n}}\n\n'''''Portal''''' is a series of [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] [[puzzle-platform]] video games developed by [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]. Set in the ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' universe, the two main games in the series, ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' (2007) and ''[[Portal 2]]'' (2011), center on a woman, [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], forced to undergo a series of tests within the Aperture Science Enrichment Center by a malicious [[artificial intelligence]], [[GLaDOS]], that controls the facility. Most of the tests involve using the \"Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\" - the \"portal gun\" - that creates a human-sized wormhole-like connection between two flat surfaces. The player-character or objects in the game world may move through portals while conserving their momentum. This allows complex \"flinging\" maneuvers to be used to cross wide gaps or perform other feats to reach the exit for each test chamber. A number of other mechanics, such as lasers, light bridges, tractor funnels and turrets, exist to aid or hinder the player's goal to reach the exit.\n\nThe ''Portal'' games are noted for bringing students and their projects from the [[DigiPen Institute of Technology]] into Valve and extending their ideas into the full games. The portal concept was introduced by the game ''[[Narbacular Drop]]'' and led to the basis for the first game. Another game, ''[[Tag: The Power of Paint]]'', formed the basis of surface-altering \"gels\" introduced in ''Portal 2''.\n\nBoth games have received near-universal praise, and have sold millions of copies. The first game was released as part of a five-game compilation, ''[[The Orange Box]]'', and though intended as a short bonus feature of the compilation, was instead considered the highlight of the five. Its success led to the creation of the much longer ''Portal 2'', which included both single player and cooperative player modes; it too received mostly positive critical reviews. In addition to the challenging puzzle elements, both games are praised for its [[black comedy|dark humor]], written by [[Erik Wolpaw]], [[Chet Faliszek]], and [[Jay Pinkerton]], voice work by actors [[Ellen McLain]], [[Stephen Merchant]], and [[J.K. Simmons]], and musical songs by [[Jonathan Coulton]]. A number of spin-off media have been developed alongside the games, and several of the game elements have become parts of [[Internet meme]]s.\n\n==Setting and characters==\n{{see also|Characters in the Portal series|Portal (video game)#Plot|Portal 2#Plot}}\n[[File:Aperture Laboratories Logo.svg|thumb|200px|right|One of the in-game logos for Aperture.]]\nBoth ''Portal'' games take place in the fictional \"Aperture Science Enrichment Center\". Aperture Science was founded by [[Cave Johnson (Portal)|Cave Johnson]] (voiced by [[J.K. Simmons]]) and originally sought to make shower curtains for the military. Its research happened upon the discovery of portal technology, and soon became a direct competitor with [[Black Mesa Research Facility]] (from the ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' series) for government funding. Johnson acquired the rights to a disused salt mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where they started building a labyrinthine set of offices, laboratories, facilities, and test chambers. During this time, Johnson became poisoned from exposure to moon dust, a key component of the paint needed for the portal technology, and became increasingly deranged.\n\nIn ''Portal 2'', the player explores these long-abandoned areas of Aperture, learning that the company had moved from testing on the country's finest, to paid volunteers, and ultimately to forcing its own employees to participate in testing. Near the point of his death, Johnson ordered his lifelong assistant Caroline (voiced by [[Ellen McLain]]) to be the first test subject for a mind-to-computer transfer; her personality would ultimately form the core of [[GLaDOS]] (also McLain). Sometime after Johnson's death, the old sections of the facility were vitrified, and a more modern facility built atop those ruins. GLaDOS was built to control the facility and monitor the tests, but researchers found that the computer had villainous tendencies, threatening to kill the entire staff before it was shut down in time. The Aperture researchers constructed a number of \"personality cores\" that would fit onto GLaDOS to prevent her from turning against them.  Despite this, on the day she was officially activated (coincidentally on \"[[Take Your Daughter to Work Day]]\"), she turned against the researchers and killed nearly everyone in the facility with lethal doses of neurotoxin gas. In the games and the comic ''Lab Rat'', one employee Doug Rattmann survived due to his schizophrenia and distrust of GLaDOS. In trying to find a way to defeat GLaDOS, he finds that [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], one of the human subjects kept in cryogenic storage within Aperture, has a high level of tenacity, and arranges for the events of ''Portal'' to occur by moving her to the top of GLaDOS' testing list. GLaDOS remains driven to test human subjects despite the lack of humans.\n\n[[File:Portal 2 character poster.jpg|thumb|right|A promotional poster created by Valve artist Tristan Reidford, showcasing the characters from ''Portal''. From center top clockwise: Chell, GLaDOS, P-Body (left) and Atlas, the turrets, Cave Johnson (in picture frame), a Companion Cube, and Wheatley]]\nThe player is introduced to Aperture in ''Portal'', which is said by Valve to be set sometime between the events of ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. The player-character Chell is awakened by GLaDOS for testing. Chell resists GLaDOS' lies and verbal ploys and succeeds to defeat GLaDOS' core, the destruction creating a portal implosion that sends Chell to the surface, unconscious. Rattmann, who has helped Chell by writing warning messages and directions to maintenance areas on the facility walls and had observed the final battle, escapes Aperture, but on witnessing a robot dragging Chell's body back inside, sacrifices his escape to assure that Chell is put into indefinite cryogenic storage. He himself is critically wounded but appears to make it to another cryogenic chamber, though his ultimate fate is not revealed.\n\n''Portal 2'' takes place numerous years after the events of the first game; the Aperture facility has fallen into disrepair without GLaDOS. A personality core named Wheatley ([[Stephen Merchant]]) wakes Chell from her sleep to help her stop a reactor failure, but inadvertently awakens GLaDOS, who had backed up her personality. Though they defeat GLaDOS by putting Wheatley in her place, Wheatley is overwhelmed with power, sending Chell and GLaDOS, temporarily reduced to a small computer powered by a potato, to the old core of Aperture, where GLaDOS rediscovers her relation to Caroline. They return to the surface where they are forced to defeat Wheatley before his ineptitude with the Aperture systems causes the facility reactors to become critical and explode. GLaDOS is returned to her rightful place and returns the facility to normal. GLaDOS then lets Chell go, realizing that the prospect of trying to kill her is too much trouble. Instead, she turns to two robots of her own creation, Atlas and P-Body, to locate a mythical store of additional human subjects kept in cryogenic sleep for her to continue testing on.\n\nIn addition to these characters, the game includes numerous laser-seeking turrets that seek to kill the player-characters, though are apologetic for it; most are voiced by McLain, though some defective ones in the sequel are voiced by [[Nolan North]]. GLaDOS introduces Chell to the \"Weighted Companion Cube\", appearing similar to other Weighed Cubes (crates) in the game, but decorated with hearts on its sides; GLaDOS attempts to make Chell believe the Companion Cube is a sentient object and a key to her survival, before making Chell dispose of it in an incinerator prior to leaving a test chamber. Both games feature other personality cores that were constructed to keep GLaDOS in check; the first game includes three cores, the Morality, Curiosity, and Intelligence Cores, voiced by McLain as well as a snarling Anger Core voiced by [[Mike Patton]].  In ''Portal 2'', three more such cores (beyond Wheatley) are introduced including the irrelevant Fact Core, the bold Adventure Core, and the space-obsessed Space Core, each voiced by North.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{multiple images | align=center | direction=horizontal | image1 = Portal physics-2.svg | width1 = 300 | image2 = Portal physics-3.svg | width2 = 300 |  footer = Two examples of \"flinging\" using portals within ''Portal''. On the left, the player has placed portals on the floor of the pit and the wall above; by jumping into the blue one in the pit, they will exit the orange one with the same magnitude of velocity, clearing the pit and landing on the other side. On the right, the player has initially placed the blue portal in the pit and the orange on the wall; after jumping into the blue and exiting the orange (red path), they use the portal gun to place the second blue one on the ledge, gaining more momentum before falling into it and exiting the orange portal with more velocity (green track) as to land on the higher platform.}}\nThe player controls the main character (Chell in the single player campaigns, or one of Atlas and P-Body in the cooperative mode) from a first-person view, running, jumping, and interacting with switches or other devices. The player-characters are able to withstand large drops, but can be killed by falling in the toxic water of the facility, crushed to death, passing through laser grids, or fired on repeatedly by turrets.\n\nBoth games are generally divided into a series of test chambers; other sections of the game are more exploratory areas that connect these chambers. Each chamber has an exit door that must be reached, often requiring that certain conditions have been met such as having weighed down a large button with a \"Weighted Cube\", effectively a crate. These puzzles require the use of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, the portal gun.  The gun can shoot two portals, colored differently for identification, on any flat surface that is painted with a specific paint containing moon dust. Once both portal ends are placed, the player can walk the character between them, or carry objects with the portal gun through them.  Portal ends can be re positioned as often as necessary, but certain actions, such as walking through \"emancipation grills\" or moving a surface with a portal will cause the portals to dissipate.\n\nA critical feature of portals is that they retain the magnitude of momentum when an object travels through it; as stated by GLaDOS to the player in the first game, \"Speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out\". When portals are placed on non-parallel planes, this can create the effect of \"flinging\".  Commonly, one uses gravity to build up their momentum when they fall into a portal, which flings them out of the other side to gain speed and distance that normal jumping and running could not generate.  A leapfrogging effect can be used by placing portals in series during this flinging, gaining further momentum with each use.\n\nPortals will also allow light and other objects to transfer through them, and numerous puzzles involve using portals to manipulate bouncing energy balls, lasers, \"hard light\" bridges, and tractor beams to access new locations or direct objects to specific receptacles that must be activated to open the level's exit. ''Portal 2'' introduces \"mobility gels\" that can paint surfaces, including turrets and cubes, that can also move through portals though not directly by the player.

The effort is built on a standalone \"Puzzle Maker\" that incorporates the level editor for ''Portal 2'' that was released as free content for the game in early 2012. Valve had built the Puzzle Maker with the aid of educators, as to make it suitable for lesson plans as well as making it as easy for teachers to use to construct such plans. The Puzzle Maker is not limited to physics, but designed to be modular so that other fields, such as fundamental electronics or chemistry, could be included.<ref name=\"wired schools\"/> The \"Teach with Portals\" initiative is built atop of a stripped-down version of the Steam client, \"Steam for Schools\", that is designed to be used in schools, allowing instructors to control the installation of the games and lesson plans on the students' computers. These tools, as well as copies of ''Portal 2'' and the Puzzle Maker, are being offered for free for all educators.<ref name=\"wired schools\"/>\n\n==Film adaptation==\nIn February 2013, Valve president [[Gabe Newell]] and film director [[J. J. Abrams]] announced that they were to collaborate on a film adaption of the ''Portal'' series.<ref>[https://www.engadget.com/2013/02/06/valve-bad-robot-games-film/ Portal and Half-Life Creator Gabe Newell teams up with Filmmaker J.

Abrams states Movies are in the script stage and are in the works]</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nSeveral elements of the ''Portal'' series have entered popular culture, typically as bases for [[Internet memes]].\n*During ''Portal'', the player explores areas outside of the test chambers where scrawled messages left by Rattmann and others warn of GLaDOS' deception.  In particular, while GLaDOS promises that Chell will receive cake for completing the training courses, the messages alert that this reward does not exist, and that \"the cake is a lie\". The phrase \"the cake is a lie\" became an Internet meme, leading to numerous cake-related jokes, as well as its adaption as a term relating to a false promise. When writing ''Portal 2'', Wolpaw stated that they were so sick of cake jokes that they purposely avoided any reference to that, save for one subtle nod.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n*In one ''Portal'' level, the player is given an inanimate weighted cube with hearts on its side, called the \"Weighted Companion Cube\" by GLaDOS. GLaDOS proceeds to taunt the player by asserting that the Cube is alive, that it is Chell's friend, and otherwise attempting to form an attraction to it. The player is required to use the Weighted Companion Cube to complete the level, but to exit the level, the player must then drop the Cube into an incinerator. The Weighted Companion Cube became a popular item to include on ''Portal''-themed merchandise.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n*''Portal''{{'s}} credit sequence plays over the song \"[[Still Alive]]\", composed by [[Jonathan Coulton]], and, in its original form, sung by Ellen McLain in the GLaDOS voice. The song, sung from GLaDOS's point of view as considering her defeat as \"a success\", contributed to the positive response of the game as well as highlight Coulton's work to players, and leading to Valve bringing back Coulton to record a credits song for ''Portal 2''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/06/07/the-best-video-game-surprise-songs.aspx | title = The Best Video Game Surprise Songs | first = Kyle | last = Hilliard | date = June 7, 2013 | accessdate = June 7, 2013 | work = [[Game Informer]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130609235334/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/06/07/the-best-video-game-surprise-songs.aspx | archivedate = June 9, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n*In 2017, a cosmetic set based on the Companion Cube was released as a visual replacement for the \"Io\" character in Valve's [[multiplayer online battle arena]] game, ''[[Dota 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Sam|title=Valve Reveals Companion Cube Cosmetic For Dota 2 Hero|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/19/valve-reveals-companion-cube-cosmetic-for-dota-2-hero|website=IGN|accessdate=20 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519033242/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/19/valve-reveals-companion-cube-cosmetic-for-dota-2-hero|archivedate=May 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|www.thinkwithportals.com}}\n\n{{Portal series}}\n{{Half-Life}}\n{{Valve}}\n\n[[Category:Portal (series)| ]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises introduced in 2007]]\n[[Category:Video games adapted into comics]]\n", "name_user": "50.238.182.113", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eGameplay)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(series)"}

It is attached to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]].\n\nThe unit's heritage stems from World War II, with the creation of the [[50th Parachute Brigade (India)|50th Parachute Brigade]] in October 1941. 9 Para SF, raised in 1966 as '''9th Parachute Commando Battalion''', is the oldest among the eight Para SF units of the Indian Army.\n\n==History==\n\nThe parachute units of the Indian Army are among the oldest airborne units in the world. The [[50th Indian Parachute Brigade]] was formed on 27 October 1941, comprising the British [[156th Parachute Battalion (United Kingdom)|151st Parachute Battalion]], the [[British Indian Army]] 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion, and the 153rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm Parachute Regiment, India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100338/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm |date=22 February 2014 }} on GlobalSecurity.org</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soc.mil/ARSOF_History/articles/v14n2_vajra_prahar_sb_parachute.html|title=Sidebar: Indian Army Parachute Regiment: A Brief History|last=|first=|date=2018|website=United States Army Special Operations Command|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> The Parachute Regiment was formed from these and several other units in 1952.\n\nIn 1944, the 50th was allocated to the newly founded [[44th Airborne Division (India)|44th Airborne Division]]. In the post-independence restructuring, India retained only one parachute brigade\u2014the 50th. This brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the then Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (Punjab), 2 PARA (Maratha) and 3 PARA (Kumaon). During the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] operations of 1947-48 these battalions distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, [[Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir|Naushera]], Jhangar and [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]], and were awarded the respective Battle Honours.\n\nOn 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the Parachute Regiment. Since then the Parachute Regiment has grown to comprise ten battalions including Parachute (Special Forces) battalions. In 1986, 8 PARA became 12 Battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment, while 21 Maratha LI converted to PARA (Special Forces). During their short but eventful existence so far, the regiment's battalions have had extensive operational experience, and singular achievements, to speak of their level of professionalism.\n\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], an ''ad hoc'' commando unit, named Meghdoot Force, consisting of volunteers from various infantry units was organized by then Major Megh Singh of the [[Brigade of the Guards]]. The unit performed well in combat, and the Government authorized the formal raising of a commando unit. [[Megh Singh|Lt Col Megh Singh]] was selected to raise the unit which was originally intended to be a part of the Brigade of the Guards. However, recognizing parachute qualification as an integral element of special operations, the unit was transferred to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]] and raised as its 9th Battalion (Commando) on 1 July 1966. The erstwhile members of the Meghdoot Force formed the nucleus, and the new unit was based in [[Gwalior]]. In June 1967 the unit was split equally into two to form a second commando unit, designated as 10th Battalion, each with three Companies.  10th Battalion was mandated to operate in the [[Thar Desert|Western Desert]] and 9th Battalion in the northern mountains. In 1969, these battalions were re-designated as 9 and 10 Para (Commando) battalions.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1978, the 1 Para, as an experiment, was converted to become the first special forces unit of the Indian army, and was kept as the tactical reserve. Already a recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice, and the [[General officer commanding|GOC-in-C]] Eastern Command Unit Citation once, the unit was originally 1 Punjab, which was later re-designated as 1 PARA (PUNJAB) and in 1978 was converted to 1 PARA (SF). The unit is well over 200 years old.\n\nOn 15 January 1992, the Parachute Regiment Training Centre along with the Records and PAO(OR), and the Para Regiment, moved to Bangalore and occupied the erstwhile location of Pioneer Corps and Training Centre. Bangalore is the new Key Location Project of the Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|title=Welcome to The Parachute Regiment|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729190919/http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|archivedate=29 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n1995 saw the formation of the fourth commando battalion when [[Maratha Light Infantry|21 Maratha Light Infantry]] was selected to convert to special forces and slated for the Eastern Command. After a stringent selection and training process that spanned more than a year, on 1 February 1996, the unit under Colonel VB Shinde, was formally inducted as the 21st Battalion (Special Forces), The Parachute Regiment. The unit has done well in its short lifespan and is the proud recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice (1992 and 2006) and the GOC-in-C Eastern Command Unit Citation once (2008), as well as a host of individual gallantry awards. With the changing scenario in military operations and the need for more special forces units, 2 Para began the conversion process from parachute to special forces role, followed closely by the 3 Para and the 4 Para in the year 2004 and 2005. The attempt did see a some success, but the reason it failed to achieve its goal was due to the stringent selection process.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan War===\nThe unit first saw action in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Indo-Pakistani war]], the first six-man assault team was inserted {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=off}} deep into Indus and Charchao, where they carried out raids. The assault team killed 73 and wounded 140 on the Pakistani side. In addition, they also destroyed 35mm artillery guns of the Pakistan independent battery. They also destroyed an airfield. In Bangladesh 2 PARA (Airborne), which was a part of 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade, carried out India's first airborne assault operation to capture Poongli Bridge in Mymensingh District near Dhaka. Subsequently, they were the first unit to enter Dhaka. For this action 2 PARA were given the Battle Honour of Poongli Bridge and the Theater Honour Dhaka.<ref name=popl>{{cite book|last=Rao|first=K.

During the operation, six artillery guns were destroyed by a raiding team composed of six officers and around 120 soldiers led by Major C. M. Malhotra. The special forces raiders began their operation at 5.30 PM on 13 December 1971. They started off from [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]] and crossed the [[Poonch River]]. After they reached the Mandole village, they started searching for the artillery guns and eventually located them. The raiders divided themselves into six teams. Each one of the six team was tasked to destroy one of the six guns. Subsequently, an intense [[gunfight]] took place between the Indian raiders and [[Pakistan Army]] soldiers. The gunfight resulted in two Indian casualties and many Pakistani casualties, with some Pakistani soldiers escaping from the battle. Finally, the raiders destroyed all the artillery using explosives and returned to their base at 6.30 AM on 14 December 1971.<ref name=mandhol>{{cite web |title=Operation 'Mandhol' forced Pakistan to change war plan |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Operation-Mandhol-forced-Pakistan-to-change-war-plan/articleshow/27444282.cms |website=[[The Times of India]] |accessdate=27 February 2020 |date=16 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis operation caused the Pakistan military to tweak its military doctrine by assigning additional soldiers for defending artillery guns. [[Pakistan Army]] officials, who came to India as a delegation after the war had ended, acknowledged the raid. Operation Mandhol is now a part of the syllabus at the [[Indian Military Academy]].<ref name=\"mandhol\" />\n\n==== Chachro Raid ====\nA series of raids were conducted by soldiers from the 10 Para (also known as ''The Desert Scorpions'') at [[Chachro]], Virawah, [[Nagarparkar]] and [[Islamkot]] during the [[1971 Indo-Pakistani war]]. The objective of these raids were to hit [[Pakistan military]] installations located 80 kilometres inside hostile territory, disrupting supply lines, creating confusion and undertake important inroads into hostile territory. Two teams, codenamed Alpha and Charlie, trained for a duration of five months in skills such as [[desert warfare]].<ref name=\"chachro raid\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/the-chachro-raid-of-1971-indias-most-daring-surgical-strike-in-pakistan-1336153.html|title=The Chachro Raid of 1971 \u2013 India's Most Daring Surgical Strike in Pak|last=|first=|date=January 15, 2017|website=[[CNN-News18]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nDuring the raids, the Indian commandos inserted themselves 80 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory and traversed a distance of over 500 kilometres, attacking [[Pakistan military]] installations and positions. They completed the raids with zero Indian casualties.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe raids began on 5 December 1971, when commandos from the 10 Para penetrated 70 kilometres inside hostile territory. The soldiers went into a defensive posture as they encountered heavy firing from Pakistani posts. The Indian raiders sent one of their vehicles rushing towards Pakistani positions, firing a [[Light machine gun|LMG]], to distract gunfire. This tactic was successful because of the cover provided by nighttime. Subsequently, the other raiders too opened fire and overpowered the Pakistani posts.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nSoon, a [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] team was assigned the task of charting a route for the Alpha team to attack the wing headquarters of the [[Pakistan Rangers]] in [[Chachro]]. The pathfinders used the cover of darkness to chart a suitable route and green-lighted the raid before the dawn of December 7. Within a few hours, the team killed 17 Pakistani soldiers, took 12 prisoners and captured [[Chachro]]. After this raid, the Charlie team exfiltrated out of the battlefield. [[Chachro]] was subsequently handed over to Indian [[Infantry|infantrymen]] and the Alpha team proceeded further.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe Alpha team moved towards their next targets: Virawah and [[Nagarparkar]]. They reached Virawah before the dawn of December 8, moving in broad daylight the preceding day. The first contact made by the raiders with the Pakistani soldiers was at 1:30 AM. [[Hand-to-hand combat]] between the Indian raiders and the Pakistanis ensued, followed by [[Shootout|gunfights]]. Soon, Virawah was captured by the Indian raiders. The raiders then proceeded to [[Nagarparkar]] and captured it by the morning of December 8.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nFollowing this, the Indian raiders had returned to their base in India but were again tasked to attack ammunition dump in [[Islamkot]]. The raiders reached their target at 5:30 AM on December 17 but found the target empty. Subsequently, while retreating, the raiders ambushed a Pakistani convoy, killing 18-20 Pakistani troops and imprisoning survivors.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\n===Operation Bluestar 1984===\nIn 1984 the Para (SF) were involved in [[Operation Blue Star]]. They were charged to lead an attack on the Holy Site of the Sikh religion the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] to evict Sikh militants in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. 80 members of 1 Para (SF) were given the task of assaulting two areas of the temple, one of which required divers. However, there were a number of setbacks as a result of inaccurate intelligence on the strength of the militants who were trained by Gen. [[Shabeg Singh]] (ex- 1 Para himself), operating in low light, the conventional manner of the raid, and the lack of incentive, all of which resulted in a mission failure. The diver mission was aborted after the first team got bogged down. The commandos accompanied by Raghunath dubey achieved their aims after a gunfight with militants that lasted hours.<ref name=\"Katoch\">{{cite web |title=Interview Lt Gen P.C.

However, the lack of proper planning by the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF), and insufficient intelligence on the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]'s (LTTE) whereabouts, caused [[Jaffna University Helidrop|the initial heli-borne assault]] on Jaffna University on 11 October 1987 to be a tragic failure. However it was because of the efforts of the Para (SF) that later led to the capture of the Jaffna peninsula, forcing the LTTE militants to take refuge in the forests.\n\nSix soldiers lost their lives in that mission. Due to their superior training, the Para (SF) took refuge under a house, after they were misled by a youth who offered his services to help the commandos track [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] but instead took them on a wild goose chase. They engaged the enemy for 24 hours and picked up all their dead with their weapons after reinforcements arrived the next morning.\n\nAfter the failed assault on Jaffna City, the 10 Para (SF) participated in a heli-borne assault on the town of Moolai {{convert|23|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the north west in November 1987. More than 200 LTTE guerrillas were killed and an arms depot seized. In order to give the commandos battle experience, 1 Para (SF) was rotated home in early 1988 and replaced by 9 Para (SF).\n\nThis battalion was scheduled to return home in June 1988, but the tour of duty was extended due to a planned air assault into the coastal swamps around [[Mullaitivu District|Mullaittivu]]. The mission was a success, in that it located several arms caches. The 9 Para (SF) also provided 12 men for the security of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka.\n\n===Operation Cactus 1988, Maldives===\n{{Main|Operation Cactus}}\nWith the capture of [[Maldives]], an island nation off the south western coast of India, on 3 November 1988 by the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam]] (PLOTE) [[mercenaries]], the army turned to the 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade to carry out an airborne/air transported operation to liberate the country and return power to the legal government. This operation had 6 PARA spearheading the mission. 6 Para flew in on 4 November 1988 in a fleet of [[IL-76]], [[An-32]] and [[An-12]] transport aircraft. One team rescued the president, another took over the airfield, and a third rescued Maldivian security personnel besieged in the [[National Security Service (Maldives)|National Security Service]] HQ.

About 90 operators commanded by Major (now Lt. Col.)

The first major mobilization of troops in 2009 ended on 21 April. As the troops began pulling out, an Army spokesperson described the operation as a success, disclosing that 129 militants, all belonging to the [[People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak]] (PREPAK) were killed. The Forces also claimed to have located and destroyed five militant camps during the Operation and more than 117 weapons, including sixty nine AK-series rifles, forty-eight rocket launchers, and an unspecified quantity of explosives and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). No militant was arrested. No fatalities among the Special Force (SF) personnel or civilians was reported.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idsa.in/TWIR/4_3_2009_Manipur|title=Manipur: Operation \u2018Summer Storm\u2019 called off {{!}} Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|website=idsa.in|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/myanmar-operation-sends-a-larger-political-message-india-will-pay-back-if-provoked/articleshow/47657355.cms|title=Myanmar operation sends a larger political message: India will pay back, if provoked|date=2015-06-14|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/operation-summer-storm-392192|title=Operation Summer Storm|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Ongoing counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir and in northeastern India===\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://spiderimg.amarujala.com/assets/images/2020/01/31/750x506/nagrota-terror-attack_1580463635.jpeg Para SF operators arrive to take position] before a gunfight took place at a toll plaza in Nagrota, Jammu and Kashmir in January 2020.

They are now actively involved in counter terrorist (CT) and COIN operations in Kashmir as an essential part of the Home Ministry's decision to conduct pro-active raids against militants in the countryside and mountains. Personnel include Para (SF), Paratroopers (Airborne), [[National Security Guards]] (NSG) and special units of the [[Rashtriya Rifles]] - a paramilitary unit created for counter insurgency operations in Kashmir.

The terrorists sneaked across the border early on Thursday, barely three days ahead of a meeting between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan. The attack was on a police station. The 16 Cavalry unit of the Army in Samba district falls under the jurisdiction of 9 corps, headquartered at Yol Cantonment in Himachal Pradesh. The three heavily armed terrorists, believed to be from the group [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT), were holed up in the cavalry armored unit's camp at Samba for several hours after they barged into the Officers mess, until they were killed during a fierce gunfight with 1 Para (SF) of the army. The bodies of the three terrorists aged between 16 and 19 were in the custody of the Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Court-of-inquiry-ordered-into-terror-attack-on-army-camp-in-Samba/articleshow/23267341.cms|title=Court of inquiry ordered into terror attack on army camp in Samba - Times of India|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929133303/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Court-of-inquiry-ordered-into-terror-attack-on-army-camp-in-Samba/articleshow/23267341.cms|archivedate=29 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAuthorities moved commandos of 1 Para (SF) in helicopters to the shootout site. The Para (SF) commandos first carried out an aerial reconnaissance of the camp before landing to neutralize the three terrorists. The 1 Para (SF) had identified the exact spot during the aerial reconnaissance from where the intruders were returning the army fire. After landing, the commandos started engaging the terrorists in a direct gunfight, but in order to give them an impression that their exact hiding location had still not been identified, an abandoned building inside the camp was blasted. This made the terrorists complacent thinking that their hiding spot had not been yet been pin-pointed. They kept on intermittently returning army fire until all three of them were eliminated. The entire operation, from the moment the terrorists entered the camp until they were gunned down, took nearly nine hours to complete. The main worry of the soldiers tasked to eliminate the terrorists was the Army Public School situated some distance from the place where the terrorists had been engaged in a sustained firefight. Army men were worried about the possibility of the terrorists moving into the school and taking children and staff as hostage. For this reason, the operation to eliminate the terrorists was carried out with extreme caution and patience<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|title=Battle of Samba: How army subdued fidayeens|last=IANS|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816185331/http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Counter insurgency operation in Myanmar 2015===\n{{Main|2015 Indian counter-insurgency operation in Myanmar}}\nBased on precise intelligence inputs, the Indian Air Force and 21 para (SF) carried a cross-border operation along the Indo-Myanmar border and destroyed two militant camps one each of the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (K) (NSCN) and the [[Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup]] (KYKL). The operations were carried out inside Myanmar territory along the [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]] border at two locations. One of the locations was near Ukhrul in Manipur. The army attacked two militants' transit camps.\n\n70 commandos were reportedly involved in the operation. The commandos, equipped with assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and night vision goggles, were divided into two groups after they fast roped from [[HAL Dhruv|Dhruv]] helicopters just inside the Indian territory near the border with Myanmar. The teams trekked through the thick jungles for at least {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off}} before they reached training camps. Each of the teams was further divided into two sub-groups. While one was responsible for the direct assault, the second formed an outer ring to prevent any of insurgents from running and escaping. The actual operation (hitting the camp and destroying it) took about 40 minutes. Indian Air Force [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters were put on standby, ready to be pressed into service to evacuate the commandos in case anything went wrong.

The regiment has tried raising new battalions to augment the strength of the special forces however the task has not been completed due to the tough selection phase. Furthermore, in the absence of a centralized command and lack of a centralized and standardized procedure for selection, even among the Para (SF) battalions, selection procedures vary. Meaning there is a different standard to get into different Para (SF) battalions.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, there were plans to take the three para commando battalions from the Parachute Regiment and bring them together under an individual specialized organisation, the Special Forces Regiment. However, after several logistic and administrative obstacles, these plans were abandoned, and they continue to be trained and recruited by the Parachute Regiment.\n\nPara (SF) operate in assault teams, which work individually behind enemy lines, whereas the Paratroopers (Airborne) work in large teams and coordinate with other units as their role involves occupying large areas behind enemy lines. The total strength of the regiment stands at about 10,000, this includes five airborne infantry battalions, one Rashtriya Rifles and two Territorial Army battalion personnel, while the Para (SF) includes between 5,000 and 6,000 personnel.

For the Para (Air) it was initially 28 days which became 45 days after 1999 and is now 90 days (approximately 3 months). The Para (SF) was 90 days long and hasn't been changed since. The intensity also differs according to the prospective battalion. Para (SF) selection takes place twice a year. Probationers undergo extreme physical and mental tests. The drop out rate is high. Those who fail go back to their parent regiment. Those who complete the probation are inducted into the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]. 10 Para (SF) selection: the probation for the 10 Para (SF) starts in the desert, with rigorous physical training being undertaken in desert climate. There is no training manual, so there is no specific routine. Probationers go without food for 4 days, they have to minimize water consumption up to 1 litre water for 3 days and be able to go without sleep for 7 days. A 10&nbsp;kg sandbag become a permanent buddy for the probationer. Routine speed marches and runs of 10&nbsp;km, 20&nbsp;km, 30&nbsp;km and 40&nbsp;km with full battle gears are conducted. Probationers must be exceptional navigators in areas where there is no network signal, no roads or landmarks and sand dunes that keep shifting every night.<ref name=\"mustaffa\" /> In Parachute training, candidates then complete a 3-week Basic Parachute Course at the Indian Army's Parachute Training School in Agra.\n* Advanced SF Training<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.in/Indias-Special-Forces-History-Future/dp/9382573976|title=India's Special Forces: 1: History and Future of Special Forces|last=Katoch|first=Gen P.

Although this is also a training phase, this is still part of the selection process. Here the soldiers undertake various different kinds of training with various organisations overseen by the Parachute Regiment Training Centre and the Special Forces Training School. Training includes weapons handling training land navigation and field craft training, infiltration, assault and ambush tactics; [[close quarter battle]] (CQB) training; urban warfare; counter-terrorism; unarmed combat training and various other courses across training centers of the [[Indian Defense Forces|Indian defense forces]].\n\n==== Training centers and courses ====\n* Commando Training Camp, [[Belgaum]], Karnataka\n* 4-week High-Altitude Commando Course, Parvat Ghatak School in Tawang, [[Arunachal Pradesh]]\n* Desert Warfare School, Rajasthan\n* [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS), Sonamarg, Kashmir\n* Basic Combat Divers course, Indian Navy's Dive School, [[Kochi]]\n* Counter insurgency, at the [[Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (India)|Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram\n* [[Indian Special Forces Training School (SFTS)|Indian Special Forces Training School]], Nahan, Himachal Pradesh; \n* Combat free-fall training (HAHO and HALO) at the Parachute Training School, Agra\n\n==== 90-day probation ====\nSome of the training during the 90 day selection includes:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n* Day 1 to 35: The first 35 days comprises 'Physical and Skills Training'.

It starts with a 10&nbsp;km speed march with 30&nbsp;kg battle loads and an additional 40&nbsp;kg each. This is followed by various exercises included lifting buddies over long periods. This is followed by weight shifting. Weight shifting has three rounds, where various kinds of weights have to be shifted such as 40 litres of jerry cans, tyre trucks and wooden logs up to 85&nbsp;kg in weight.<ref>{{Citation|last=DiscoveryChannelInd|title=A Test Of Will Power {{!}} India's Paratroopers: Earning The Badge|date=2016-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijDgSuxw4ZA|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> During the 11th hour, trial by water is conducted<ref>{{Citation|last=DiscoveryChannelInd|title=A Test Of Physical And Mental Strength - India's Paratroopers: Earning The Badge|date=2016-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnJNuutHuuM&t=46s|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> - simulated drowning, allowing only the bare minimum oxygen over a long period of time. This is to test probationers panic reactions under stress. The hands are also tied later on and using ropes the probationers are pulled under water. It is well known that hypoxia and blackout due to lack of oxygen is common during this test. The first 16 hours are completed without a drop of water or food. This is followed by immediate observational skills and operation tactics under pressure which included probationary having to recall objects placed in their exercises. This is followed by 10&nbsp;km speed march and 6 hours of continuous exercises. Finally practical combat skills tested such as placing ambushes, response to an ambush, making camps, stretchers and simulated evacs. This is all done at the last stage of the stress test under lack to sleep and extreme fatigue mainly to test mental endurance of the probationers under such conditions and how they react. The 36 hours stress test also sees many probationers leave.\n* Day 56: The Para SF 100&nbsp;km endurance run is a must for all probationers. With 10&nbsp;kg battle load and personal weapon of 7&nbsp;kg they have to run 100&nbsp;km. The time taken averages 13 to 15 hours. A known route the Para SF have used for this run is the hilly route between Rampur and Dakkal.

In the special forces, the members are imparted both basic and advance training. They are taught specialised modes of infiltration and exfiltration, either by air (combat freefall) or sea (combat diving). Some trainees return to PTS to undergo the free-fall course, which requires at least 50 jumps from altitudes up to {{convert|33,500|ft|m|abbr=off}} to pass. Both High Altitude Low Opening ([[HALO/HAHO|HALO]]) and High Altitude High Opening ([[HAHO]])techniques are learned. The ability to use the HAHO method and specially designed maneuverable [[parachute]]s called HAPPS (High Altitude Parachute Penetration System)/AMX-310 to conduct stealth insertions over distances up to {{convert|50|km|mi}} is also perfected.<ref name=\"BR para\" />\n\nFor combat diving training, the commandos are sent to the Naval Diving School, Kochi. Like other special forces, these para commandos are trained for land, air and water.\n\nThe daily routine begins with a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} morning run. Infiltration, exfiltration, assault, room and building intervention, intelligence gathering, patrolling, ambush tactics, counter-ambush tactics, counter insurgency, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare, guerilla warfare, asymmetric warfare, raids and sabotage, martial arts training, tactical shooting, stress firing, reflex shooting, buddy system drills, close quarter battle, tactical driving, advance weapon courses and handling, sniping, demolition training, survival skills, linguistic training, logistic training, trade-craft training is imparted by the intelligence agencies. The training drills involve live ammunition at all times which is a reason for fatal accidents at times leading to death.\n\nNight and weapons training and field craft involving {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} treks with {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} loads and live ammunition are conducted. Weekly forced marches with {{convert|65|kg|lb|abbr=on}} combat loads with distances over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} and quarterly night drops with full combat loads are also conducted.\n\nIn addition to this in-house training, the commandos also attend a number of schools run by the Army that specialise in terrain and environmental warfare.<ref name=\"BR para\" /> These include the Junior Leaders' Commando Training Camp in [[Belgaum]], [[Karnataka]], the Parvat Ghatak School (for high altitude mountain warfare) in Tawang [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the desert warfare school in [[Rajasthan]], the [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS) in Sonamarg, [[Kashmir]], the [[Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram, and the [[Indian special forces training school]] in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh.

SOF members from the three nations routinely train at each other's facilities to improve military cooperation and tactical skills. This allows the SOF operators from each nation to see tactics and perspectives offered by other top-notch organizations. [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] also conducted joint HAHO training with the Para (SF) in 1992, underwater training in 1995, and anti-terrorism training in 1997. It is thought that the [[French Foreign Legion]] also has approached CIJWS regarding the courses taught by them.

It is attached to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]].\n\nThe unit's heritage stems from World War II, with the creation of the [[50th Parachute Brigade (India)|50th Parachute Brigade]] in October 1941. 9 Para SF, raised in 1966 as '''9th Parachute Commando Battalion''', is the oldest among the eight Para SF units of the Indian Army.\n\n==History==\n\nThe parachute units of the Indian Army are among the oldest airborne units in the world. The [[50th Indian Parachute Brigade]] was formed on 27 October 1941, comprising the British [[156th Parachute Battalion (United Kingdom)|151st Parachute Battalion]], the [[British Indian Army]] 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion, and the 153rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm Parachute Regiment, India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100338/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm |date=22 February 2014 }} on GlobalSecurity.org</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soc.mil/ARSOF_History/articles/v14n2_vajra_prahar_sb_parachute.html|title=Sidebar: Indian Army Parachute Regiment: A Brief History|last=|first=|date=2018|website=United States Army Special Operations Command|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> The Parachute Regiment was formed from these and several other units in 1952.\n\nIn 1944, the 50th was allocated to the newly founded [[44th Airborne Division (India)|44th Airborne Division]]. In the post-independence restructuring, India retained only one parachute brigade\u2014the 50th. This brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the then Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (Punjab), 2 PARA (Maratha) and 3 PARA (Kumaon). During the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] operations of 1947-48 these battalions distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, [[Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir|Naushera]], Jhangar and [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]], and were awarded the respective Battle Honours.\n\nOn 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the Parachute Regiment. Since then the Parachute Regiment has grown to comprise ten battalions including Parachute (Special Forces) battalions. In 1986, 8 PARA became 12 Battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment, while 21 Maratha LI converted to PARA (Special Forces). During their short but eventful existence so far, the regiment's battalions have had extensive operational experience, and singular achievements, to speak of their level of professionalism.\n\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], an ''ad hoc'' commando unit, named Meghdoot Force, consisting of volunteers from various infantry units was organized by then Major Megh Singh of the [[Brigade of the Guards]]. The unit performed well in combat, and the Government authorized the formal raising of a commando unit. [[Megh Singh|Lt Col Megh Singh]] was selected to raise the unit which was originally intended to be a part of the Brigade of the Guards. However, recognizing parachute qualification as an integral element of special operations, the unit was transferred to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]] and raised as its 9th Battalion (Commando) on 1 July 1966. The erstwhile members of the Meghdoot Force formed the nucleus, and the new unit was based in [[Gwalior]]. In June 1967 the unit was split equally into two to form a second commando unit, designated as 10th Battalion, each with three Companies.  10th Battalion was mandated to operate in the [[Thar Desert|Western Desert]] and 9th Battalion in the northern mountains. In 1969, these battalions were re-designated as 9 and 10 Para (Commando) battalions.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1978, the 1 Para, as an experiment, was converted to become the first special forces unit of the Indian army, and was kept as the tactical reserve. Already a recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice, and the [[General officer commanding|GOC-in-C]] Eastern Command Unit Citation once, the unit was originally 1 Punjab, which was later re-designated as 1 PARA (PUNJAB) and in 1978 was converted to 1 PARA (SF). The unit is well over 200 years old.\n\nOn 15 January 1992, the Parachute Regiment Training Centre along with the Records and PAO(OR), and the Para Regiment, moved to Bangalore and occupied the erstwhile location of Pioneer Corps and Training Centre. Bangalore is the new Key Location Project of the Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|title=Welcome to The Parachute Regiment|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729190919/http://www.indianparachuteregiment.kar.nic.in/history.htm|archivedate=29 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n1995 saw the formation of the fourth commando battalion when [[Maratha Light Infantry|21 Maratha Light Infantry]] was selected to convert to special forces and slated for the Eastern Command. After a stringent selection and training process that spanned more than a year, on 1 February 1996, the unit under Colonel VB Shinde, was formally inducted as the 21st Battalion (Special Forces), The Parachute Regiment. The unit has done well in its short lifespan and is the proud recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice (1992 and 2006) and the GOC-in-C Eastern Command Unit Citation once (2008), as well as a host of individual gallantry awards. With the changing scenario in military operations and the need for more special forces units, 2 Para began the conversion process from parachute to special forces role, followed closely by the 3 Para and the 4 Para in the year 2004 and 2005. The attempt did see a some success, but the reason it failed to achieve its goal was due to the stringent selection process.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan War===\nThe unit first saw action in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Indo-Pakistani war]], the first six-man assault team was inserted {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=off}} deep into Indus and Charchao, where they carried out raids. The assault team killed 73 and wounded 140 on the Pakistani side. In addition, they also destroyed 35mm artillery guns of the Pakistan independent battery. They also destroyed an airfield. In Bangladesh 2 PARA (Airborne), which was a part of 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade, carried out India's first airborne assault operation to capture Poongli Bridge in Mymensingh District near Dhaka. Subsequently, they were the first unit to enter Dhaka. For this action 2 PARA were given the Battle Honour of Poongli Bridge and the Theater Honour Dhaka.<ref name=popl>{{cite book|last=Rao|first=K.

During the operation, six artillery guns were destroyed by a raiding team composed of six officers and around 120 soldiers led by Major C. M. Malhotra. The special forces raiders began their operation at 5.30 PM on 13 December 1971. They started off from [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]] and crossed the [[Poonch River]]. After they reached the Mandole village, they started searching for the artillery guns and eventually located them. The raiders divided themselves into six teams. Each one of the six team was tasked to destroy one of the six guns. Subsequently, an intense [[gunfight]] took place between the Indian raiders and [[Pakistan Army]] soldiers. The gunfight resulted in two Indian casualties and many Pakistani casualties, with some Pakistani soldiers escaping from the battle. Finally, the raiders destroyed all the artillery using explosives and returned to their base at 6.30 AM on 14 December 1971.<ref name=mandhol>{{cite web |title=Operation 'Mandhol' forced Pakistan to change war plan |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Operation-Mandhol-forced-Pakistan-to-change-war-plan/articleshow/27444282.cms |website=[[The Times of India]] |accessdate=27 February 2020 |date=16 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis operation caused the Pakistan military to tweak its military doctrine by assigning additional soldiers for defending artillery guns. [[Pakistan Army]] officials, who came to India as a delegation after the war had ended, acknowledged the raid. Operation Mandhol is now a part of the syllabus at the [[Indian Military Academy]].<ref name=\"mandhol\" />\n\n==== Chachro Raid ====\nA series of raids were conducted by soldiers from the 10 Para (also known as ''The Desert Scorpions'') at [[Chachro]], Virawah, [[Nagarparkar]] and [[Islamkot]] during the [[1971 Indo-Pakistani war]]. The objective of these raids were to hit [[Pakistan military]] installations located 80 kilometres inside hostile territory, disrupting supply lines, creating confusion and undertake important inroads into hostile territory. Two teams, codenamed Alpha and Charlie, trained for a duration of five months in skills such as [[desert warfare]].<ref name=\"chachro raid\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/the-chachro-raid-of-1971-indias-most-daring-surgical-strike-in-pakistan-1336153.html|title=The Chachro Raid of 1971 \u2013 India's Most Daring Surgical Strike in Pak|last=|first=|date=January 15, 2017|website=[[CNN-News18]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nDuring the raids, the Indian commandos inserted themselves 80 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory and traversed a distance of over 500 kilometres, attacking [[Pakistan military]] installations and positions. They completed the raids with zero Indian casualties.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe raids began on 5 December 1971, when commandos from the 10 Para penetrated 70 kilometres inside hostile territory. The soldiers went into a defensive posture as they encountered heavy firing from Pakistani posts. The Indian raiders sent one of their vehicles rushing towards Pakistani positions, firing a [[Light machine gun|LMG]], to distract gunfire. This tactic was successful because of the cover provided by nighttime. Subsequently, the other raiders too opened fire and overpowered the Pakistani posts.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nSoon, a [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] team was assigned the task of charting a route for the Alpha team to attack the wing headquarters of the [[Pakistan Rangers]] in [[Chachro]]. The pathfinders used the cover of darkness to chart a suitable route and green-lighted the raid before the dawn of December 7. Within a few hours, the team killed 17 Pakistani soldiers, took 12 prisoners and captured [[Chachro]]. After this raid, the Charlie team exfiltrated out of the battlefield. [[Chachro]] was subsequently handed over to Indian [[Infantry|infantrymen]] and the Alpha team proceeded further.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe Alpha team moved towards their next targets: Virawah and [[Nagarparkar]]. They reached Virawah before the dawn of December 8, moving in broad daylight the preceding day. The first contact made by the raiders with the Pakistani soldiers was at 1:30 AM. [[Hand-to-hand combat]] between the Indian raiders and the Pakistanis ensued, followed by [[Shootout|gunfights]]. Soon, Virawah was captured by the Indian raiders. The raiders then proceeded to [[Nagarparkar]] and captured it by the morning of December 8.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nFollowing this, the Indian raiders had returned to their base in India but were again tasked to attack ammunition dump in [[Islamkot]]. The raiders reached their target at 5:30 AM on December 17 but found the target empty. Subsequently, while retreating, the raiders ambushed a Pakistani convoy, killing 18-20 Pakistani troops and imprisoning survivors.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\n===Operation Bluestar 1984===\nIn 1984 the Para (SF) were involved in [[Operation Blue Star]]. They were charged to lead an attack on the Holy Site of the Sikh religion the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] to evict Sikh militants in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. 80 members of 1 Para (SF) were given the task of assaulting two areas of the temple, one of which required divers. However, there were a number of setbacks as a result of inaccurate intelligence on the strength of the militants who were trained by Gen. [[Shabeg Singh]] (ex- 1 Para himself), operating in low light, the conventional manner of the raid, and the lack of incentive, all of which resulted in a mission failure. The diver mission was aborted after the first team got bogged down. The commandos accompanied by Raghunath dubey achieved their aims after a gunfight with militants that lasted hours.<ref name=\"Katoch\">{{cite web |title=Interview Lt Gen P.C.

However, the lack of proper planning by the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF), and insufficient intelligence on the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]'s (LTTE) whereabouts, caused [[Jaffna University Helidrop|the initial heli-borne assault]] on Jaffna University on 11 October 1987 to be a tragic failure. However it was because of the efforts of the Para (SF) that later led to the capture of the Jaffna peninsula, forcing the LTTE militants to take refuge in the forests.\n\nSix soldiers lost their lives in that mission. Due to their superior training, the Para (SF) took refuge under a house, after they were misled by a youth who offered his services to help the commandos track [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] but instead took them on a wild goose chase. They engaged the enemy for 24 hours and picked up all their dead with their weapons after reinforcements arrived the next morning.\n\nAfter the failed assault on Jaffna City, the 10 Para (SF) participated in a heli-borne assault on the town of Moolai {{convert|23|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the north west in November 1987. More than 200 LTTE guerrillas were killed and an arms depot seized. In order to give the commandos battle experience, 1 Para (SF) was rotated home in early 1988 and replaced by 9 Para (SF).\n\nThis battalion was scheduled to return home in June 1988, but the tour of duty was extended due to a planned air assault into the coastal swamps around [[Mullaitivu District|Mullaittivu]]. The mission was a success, in that it located several arms caches. The 9 Para (SF) also provided 12 men for the security of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka.\n\n===Operation Cactus 1988, Maldives===\n{{Main|Operation Cactus}}\nWith the capture of [[Maldives]], an island nation off the south western coast of India, on 3 November 1988 by the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam]] (PLOTE) [[mercenaries]], the army turned to the 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade to carry out an airborne/air transported operation to liberate the country and return power to the legal government. This operation had 6 PARA spearheading the mission. 6 Para flew in on 4 November 1988 in a fleet of [[IL-76]], [[An-32]] and [[An-12]] transport aircraft. One team rescued the president, another took over the airfield, and a third rescued Maldivian security personnel besieged in the [[National Security Service (Maldives)|National Security Service]] HQ.

The first major mobilization of troops in 2009 ended on 21 April. As the troops began pulling out, an Army spokesperson described the operation as a success, disclosing that 129 militants, all belonging to the [[People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak]] (PREPAK) were killed. The Forces also claimed to have located and destroyed five militant camps during the Operation and more than 117 weapons, including sixty nine AK-series rifles, forty-eight rocket launchers, and an unspecified quantity of explosives and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). No militant was arrested. No fatalities among the Special Force (SF) personnel or civilians was reported.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idsa.in/TWIR/4_3_2009_Manipur|title=Manipur: Operation \u2018Summer Storm\u2019 called off {{!}} Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|website=idsa.in|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/myanmar-operation-sends-a-larger-political-message-india-will-pay-back-if-provoked/articleshow/47657355.cms|title=Myanmar operation sends a larger political message: India will pay back, if provoked|date=2015-06-14|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/operation-summer-storm-392192|title=Operation Summer Storm|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Ongoing counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir and in northeastern India===\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://spiderimg.amarujala.com/assets/images/2020/01/31/750x506/nagrota-terror-attack_1580463635.jpeg Para SF operators arrive to take position] before a gunfight took place at a toll plaza in Nagrota, Jammu and Kashmir in January 2020.

They are now actively involved in counter terrorist (CT) and COIN operations in Kashmir as an essential part of the Home Ministry's decision to conduct pro-active raids against militants in the countryside and mountains. Personnel include Para (SF), Paratroopers (Airborne), [[National Security Guards]] (NSG) and special units of the [[Rashtriya Rifles]] - a paramilitary unit created for counter insurgency operations in Kashmir.

The terrorists sneaked across the border early on Thursday, barely three days ahead of a meeting between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan. The attack was on a police station. The 16 Cavalry unit of the Army in Samba district falls under the jurisdiction of 9 corps, headquartered at Yol Cantonment in Himachal Pradesh. The three heavily armed terrorists, believed to be from the group [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT), were holed up in the cavalry armored unit's camp at Samba for several hours after they barged into the Officers mess, until they were killed during a fierce gunfight with 1 Para (SF) of the army.

The Para (SF) commandos first carried out an aerial reconnaissance of the camp before landing to neutralize the three terrorists. The 1 Para (SF) had identified the exact spot during the aerial reconnaissance from where the intruders were returning the army fire. After landing, the commandos started engaging the terrorists in a direct gunfight, but in order to give them an impression that their exact hiding location had still not been identified, an abandoned building inside the camp was blasted. This made the terrorists complacent thinking that their hiding spot had not been yet been pin-pointed. They kept on intermittently returning army fire until all three of them were eliminated. The entire operation, from the moment the terrorists entered the camp until they were gunned down, took nearly nine hours to complete. The main worry of the soldiers tasked to eliminate the terrorists was the Army Public School situated some distance from the place where the terrorists had been engaged in a sustained firefight. Army men were worried about the possibility of the terrorists moving into the school and taking children and staff as hostage. For this reason, the operation to eliminate the terrorists was carried out with extreme caution and patience<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|title=Battle of Samba: How army subdued fidayeens|last=IANS|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816185331/http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Counter insurgency operation in Myanmar 2015===\n{{Main|2015 Indian counter-insurgency operation in Myanmar}}\nBased on precise intelligence inputs, the Indian Air Force and 21 para (SF) carried a cross-border operation along the Indo-Myanmar border and destroyed two militant camps one each of the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (K) (NSCN) and the [[Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup]] (KYKL). The operations were carried out inside Myanmar territory along the [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]] border at two locations. One of the locations was near Ukhrul in Manipur. The army attacked two militants' transit camps.\n\n70 commandos were reportedly involved in the operation. The commandos, equipped with assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and night vision goggles, were divided into two groups after they fast roped from [[HAL Dhruv|Dhruv]] helicopters just inside the Indian territory near the border with Myanmar. The teams trekked through the thick jungles for at least {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off}} before they reached training camps. Each of the teams was further divided into two sub-groups. While one was responsible for the direct assault, the second formed an outer ring to prevent any of insurgents from running and escaping. The actual operation (hitting the camp and destroying it) took about 40 minutes. Indian Air Force [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters were put on standby, ready to be pressed into service to evacuate the commandos in case anything went wrong.

The regiment has tried raising new battalions to augment the strength of the special forces however the task has not been completed due to the tough selection phase. Furthermore, in the absence of a centralized command and lack of a centralized and standardized procedure for selection, even among the Para (SF) battalions, selection procedures vary. Meaning there is a different standard to get into different Para (SF) battalions.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, there were plans to take the three para commando battalions from the Parachute Regiment and bring them together under an individual specialized organisation, the Special Forces Regiment. However, after several logistic and administrative obstacles, these plans were abandoned, and they continue to be trained and recruited by the Parachute Regiment.\n\nPara (SF) operate in assault teams, which work individually behind enemy lines, whereas the Paratroopers (Airborne) work in large teams and coordinate with other units as their role involves occupying large areas behind enemy lines. The total strength of the regiment stands at about 10,000, this includes five airborne infantry battalions, one Rashtriya Rifles and two Territorial Army battalion personnel, while the Para (SF) includes between 5,000 and 6,000 personnel.

For the Para (Air) it was initially 28 days which became 45 days after 1999 and is now 90 days (approximately 3 months). The Para (SF) was 90 days long and hasn't been changed since. The intensity also differs according to the prospective battalion. Para (SF) selection takes place twice a year. Probationers undergo extreme physical and mental tests. The drop out rate is high. Those who fail go back to their parent regiment. Those who complete the probation are inducted into the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]. 10 Para (SF) selection: the probation for the 10 Para (SF) starts in the desert, with rigorous physical training being undertaken in desert climate. There is no training manual, so there is no specific routine. Probationers go without food for 4 days, they have to minimize water consumption up to 1 litre water for 3 days and be able to go without sleep for 7 days. A 10&nbsp;kg sandbag become a permanent buddy for the probationer. Routine speed marches and runs of 10&nbsp;km, 20&nbsp;km, 30&nbsp;km and 40&nbsp;km with full battle gears are conducted. Probationers must be exceptional navigators in areas where there is no network signal, no roads or landmarks and sand dunes that keep shifting every night.<ref name=\"mustaffa\" /> In Parachute training, candidates then complete a 3-week Basic Parachute Course at the Indian Army's Parachute Training School in Agra.\n* Advanced SF Training<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.in/Indias-Special-Forces-History-Future/dp/9382573976|title=India's Special Forces: 1: History and Future of Special Forces|last=Katoch|first=Gen P.

Although this is also a training phase, this is still part of the selection process. Here the soldiers undertake various different kinds of training with various organisations overseen by the Parachute Regiment Training Centre and the Special Forces Training School. Training includes weapons handling training land navigation and field craft training, infiltration, assault and ambush tactics; [[close quarter battle]] (CQB) training; urban warfare; counter-terrorism; unarmed combat training and various other courses across training centers of the [[Indian Defense Forces|Indian defense forces]].\n\n==== Training centers and courses ====\n* Commando Training Camp, [[Belgaum]], Karnataka\n* 4-week High-Altitude Commando Course, Parvat Ghatak School in Tawang, [[Arunachal Pradesh]]\n* Desert Warfare School, Rajasthan\n* [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS), Sonamarg, Kashmir\n* Basic Combat Divers course, Indian Navy's Dive School, [[Kochi]]\n* Counter insurgency, at the [[Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (India)|Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram\n* [[Indian Special Forces Training School (SFTS)|Indian Special Forces Training School]], Nahan, Himachal Pradesh; \n* Combat free-fall training (HAHO and HALO) at the Parachute Training School, Agra\n\n==== 90-day probation ====\nSome of the training during the 90 day selection includes:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n* Day 1 to 35: The first 35 days comprises 'Physical and Skills Training'.

It starts with a 10&nbsp;km speed march with 30&nbsp;kg battle loads and an additional 40&nbsp;kg each. This is followed by various exercises included lifting buddies over long periods. This is followed by weight shifting. Weight shifting has three rounds, where various kinds of weights have to be shifted such as 40 litres of jerry cans, tyre trucks and wooden logs up to 85&nbsp;kg in weight.<ref>{{Citation|last=DiscoveryChannelInd|title=A Test Of Will Power {{!}} India's Paratroopers: Earning The Badge|date=2016-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijDgSuxw4ZA|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> During the 11th hour, trial by water is conducted<ref>{{Citation|last=DiscoveryChannelInd|title=A Test Of Physical And Mental Strength - India's Paratroopers: Earning The Badge|date=2016-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnJNuutHuuM&t=46s|accessdate=2018-03-06}}</ref> - simulated drowning, allowing only the bare minimum oxygen over a long period of time. This is to test probationers panic reactions under stress. The hands are also tied later on and using ropes the probationers are pulled under water. It is well known that hypoxia and blackout due to lack of oxygen is common during this test. The first 16 hours are completed without a drop of water or food. This is followed by immediate observational skills and operation tactics under pressure which included probationary having to recall objects placed in their exercises. This is followed by 10&nbsp;km speed march and 6 hours of continuous exercises. Finally practical combat skills tested such as placing ambushes, response to an ambush, making camps, stretchers and simulated evacs. This is all done at the last stage of the stress test under lack to sleep and extreme fatigue mainly to test mental endurance of the probationers under such conditions and how they react. The 36 hours stress test also sees many probationers leave.\n* Day 56: The Para SF 100&nbsp;km endurance run is a must for all probationers. With 10&nbsp;kg battle load and personal weapon of 7&nbsp;kg they have to run 100&nbsp;km. The time taken averages 13 to 15 hours. A known route the Para SF have used for this run is the hilly route between Rampur and Dakkal.

In the special forces, the members are imparted both basic and advance training. They are taught specialised modes of infiltration and exfiltration, either by air (combat freefall) or sea (combat diving). Some trainees return to PTS to undergo the free-fall course, which requires at least 50 jumps from altitudes up to {{convert|33,500|ft|m|abbr=off}} to pass. Both High Altitude Low Opening ([[HALO/HAHO|HALO]]) and High Altitude High Opening ([[HAHO]])techniques are learned. The ability to use the HAHO method and specially designed maneuverable [[parachute]]s called HAPPS (High Altitude Parachute Penetration System)/AMX-310 to conduct stealth insertions over distances up to {{convert|50|km|mi}} is also perfected.<ref name=\"BR para\" />\n\nFor combat diving training, the commandos are sent to the Naval Diving School, Kochi. Like other special forces, these para commandos are trained for land, air and water.\n\nThe daily routine begins with a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} morning run. Infiltration, exfiltration, assault, room and building intervention, intelligence gathering, patrolling, ambush tactics, counter-ambush tactics, counter insurgency, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare, guerilla warfare, asymmetric warfare, raids and sabotage, martial arts training, tactical shooting, stress firing, reflex shooting, buddy system drills, close quarter battle, tactical driving, advance weapon courses and handling, sniping, demolition training, survival skills, linguistic training, logistic training, trade-craft training is imparted by the intelligence agencies. The training drills involve live ammunition at all times which is a reason for fatal accidents at times leading to death.\n\nNight and weapons training and field craft involving {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} treks with {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} loads and live ammunition are conducted. Weekly forced marches with {{convert|65|kg|lb|abbr=on}} combat loads with distances over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} and quarterly night drops with full combat loads are also conducted.\n\nIn addition to this in-house training, the commandos also attend a number of schools run by the Army that specialise in terrain and environmental warfare.<ref name=\"BR para\" /> These include the Junior Leaders' Commando Training Camp in [[Belgaum]], [[Karnataka]], the Parvat Ghatak School (for high altitude mountain warfare) in Tawang [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the desert warfare school in [[Rajasthan]], the [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS) in Sonamarg, [[Kashmir]], the [[Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram, and the [[Indian special forces training school]] in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh.

SOF members from the three nations routinely train at each other's facilities to improve military cooperation and tactical skills. This allows the SOF operators from each nation to see tactics and perspectives offered by other top-notch organizations. [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] also conducted joint HAHO training with the Para (SF) in 1992, underwater training in 1995, and anti-terrorism training in 1997. It is thought that the [[French Foreign Legion]] also has approached CIJWS regarding the courses taught by them.

He was the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1940 to 1945, when he led Britain to victory in the [[Second World War]], and again from 1951 to 1955. Churchill represented five constituencies during his career as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP). Ideologically an [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] and [[British Empire|imperialist]], for most of his career he was a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which he led from 1940 to 1955, but from 1904 to 1924 was a member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].\n\n<!--Early life and career prior to the Second World War-->\nOf mixed [[English people|English]] and [[Americans|American]] parentage, Churchill was born in [[Oxfordshire]] to [[Spencer family|a wealthy, aristocratic family]]. He joined the [[British Army]] in 1895, and saw action in [[British Raj|British India]], the [[Mahdist War|Anglo\u2013Sudan War]], and the [[Second Boer War]], gaining fame as a [[war correspondent]] and writing books about his campaigns. Elected an MP in 1900, initially as a Conservative, he defected to the Liberals in 1904. In [[H. H. Asquith]]'s [[Liberal government, 1905\u20131915|Liberal government]], Churchill served as [[President of the Board of Trade]], [[Home Secretary]], and [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], championing [[Liberal welfare reforms|prison reform and workers' social security]]. During the [[First World War]], he oversaw the [[Gallipoli campaign|Gallipoli Campaign]]; after it proved a disaster, he resigned from government and served in the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1917, he returned to government under [[David Lloyd George]] as [[Minister of Munitions]], then as [[Secretary of State for War]] and [[Secretary of State for Air|Air]], and finally [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|for the Colonies]], overseeing the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and Britain's Middle East policy. After two years out of Parliament, he served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s [[Second Baldwin ministry|Conservative government]], returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the [[gold standard]] at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy.\n\n<!--Later life, the Second World War, and Cold War-->\nOut of office during the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the [[appeasement|growing threat]] from [[Nazi Germany]]. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1940 he became prime minister, replacing [[Neville Chamberlain]]. Churchill oversaw British involvement in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort against Germany and the [[Axis powers]], resulting in victory in 1945. His wartime leadership was widely praised, although acts like the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Bombing of Dresden]] and his wartime response to the [[Bengal famine of 1943|Bengal famine]] generated controversy. After the Conservatives' defeat in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], he became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Amid the developing [[Cold War]] with the [[Soviet Union]], he publicly warned of an \"[[Iron Curtain|iron curtain]]\" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. Re-elected Prime Minister in [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951]], his second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, including the [[Malayan Emergency]], [[Mau Mau Uprising]], [[Korean War]], and a UK-backed [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|Iranian coup]]. Domestically his government emphasised house-building and developed a nuclear weapon. In declining health, Churchill resigned as prime minister in 1955, although he remained an MP until [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]]. Upon his death in 1965, he was given a [[State funerals in the United Kingdom|state funeral]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Churchill remains popular in Britain and throughout [[Western world|the West]], where he is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's [[liberal democracy]] from the spread of [[fascism]]. Praised as a social reformer and accomplished writer, among his many awards was the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Conversely, his imperialist views and comments on race, as well as his sanctioning of human rights abuses in the suppression of [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] movements seeking independence from the [[British Empire]], have generated considerable controversy.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood and schooling: 1874\u20131895===\n[[File:Blenheim Palace from the Water Terraces October 2016.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blenheim Palace]], Churchill's ancestral home and his birthplace]]\nChurchill was born at the family's ancestral home, [[Blenheim Palace]] in [[Oxfordshire]], on 30 November 1874,{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=5}} at which time the United Kingdom was the dominant world power.{{sfn|Best|2001|p=1}} Direct descendants of the [[Dukes of Marlborough]], his family were among the highest levels of the British aristocracy,{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2pp=3, 5}} and thus he was born into the country's governing elite.{{sfnm|1a1=Best|1y=2001|1p=2|2a1=Haffner|2y=2003|2p=2}} His paternal grandfather, [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough]], had been a Member of Parliament (MP) for ten years, a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] who served in the government of Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]].{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1p=4|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2pp=7\u20138}} His own father, [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], had been elected Conservative MP for [[Woodstock (UK Parliament constituency)|Woodstock]] in 1873.{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Best|2y=2001|2p=3|3a1=Jenkins|3y=2001|3p=4|4a1=Robbins|4y=2014|4p=2}} His mother, [[Lady Randolph Churchill|Jennie Churchill]] (n\u00e9e Jerome), was from an American family whose substantial wealth derived from finance.{{sfnm|1a1=Best|1y=2001|1p=4|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2pp=5\u20136|3a1=Addison|3y=2005|3p=7}} The couple had met in August 1873, and were engaged three days later, marrying at the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Paris|British Embassy in Paris]] in April 1874.{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1pp=5, 7|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2p=9|3a1=Robbins|3y=2014|3p=2}} The couple lived beyond their income and were frequently in debt;{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=6\u20137}} according to the biographer [[Sebastian Haffner]], the family were \"rich by normal standards but poor by those of the rich\".{{sfn|Haffner|2003|p=15}}\n\n[[File:Churchill 1881 ZZZ 7555D.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Churchill, aged six, in 1881{{sfn|Haffner|2003|p=4}}]]\nIn 1876 John Spencer-Churchill was appointed [[Viceroy of Ireland]], with Randolph as his private secretary, resulting in the Churchill family's relocation to [[Dublin]], when [[History of Ireland (1801\u20131923)|the entirety of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2p=9}} It was here that Jennie's second son, [[John Strange Spencer-Churchill|Jack]], was born in 1880;{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=7|3a1=Addison|3y=2005|3p=10}} there has been speculation that Randolph was not his biological father.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=7}} Throughout much of the 1880s Randolph and Jennie were effectively estranged, and during this time she had many suitors.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=8}} Churchill had virtually no relationship with his father;{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1p=10|2a1=Haffner|2y=2003|2p=13}} referring to his mother, Churchill later stated that \"I loved her dearly\u2014but at a distance.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=8|3a1=Reagles|3a2=Larsen|3y=2013|3p=8}} His relationship with Jack was warm.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=7}} In Dublin, the brothers were cared for primarily by their nanny, [[Elizabeth Everest]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1pp=2\u20133|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=10|3a1=Reagles|3a2=Larsen|3y=2013|3p=8}} Churchill nicknamed her \"Woomany\",{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=16, 29}} and later wrote that \"She had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years I had lived.\"{{sfn|Best|2001|p=6}}\n\nAged seven, he began [[boarding school|boarding]] at [[St. George's School, Ascot|St. George's School]] in [[Ascot, Berkshire]];

Churchill later claimed that, on learning of his appointment, the Board of the Admiralty sent a signal to the Fleet: \"Winston is back\".{{sfn|Churchill|1967b|p=7}} Although this story was repeated by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] in a speech at [[Edmonton]] in 1966, [[Richard Langworth]] notes that neither he nor Churchill's official biographer [[Martin Gilbert]] have found contemporary evidence to confirm it, suggesting that it may well be a later invention.{{sfn|Langworth|2008|p=581}}\n\nAs First Lord, Churchill proved to be one of the highest-profile ministers during the so-called \"[[Phoney War]]\", when the only significant action was at sea and in the [[Russo-Finnish War|USSR's attack on Finland]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} He was concerned about German naval activity in the [[Baltic Sea]] and initially planned to send a naval force there but this was soon changed to a plan, codenamed [[Operation Wilfred]], to mine Norwegian waters and stop [[iron ore]] shipments from [[Narvik]] to Germany.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} There were disagreements about mining, both in the war cabinet and with the French government. As a result, Wilfred was delayed until 8 April 1940, the day before the successful [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion of Norway]] was launched.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=573\u2013574}}\n\n==Prime Minister: 1940\u20131945==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[First premiership of Winston Churchill]], [[First prime ministership of Winston Churchill]], [[Premiership of Winston Churchill]], [[Prime ministership of Winston Churchill]] -->\n{{for timeline|Timeline of the first premiership of Winston Churchill}}\n{{further|Churchill war ministry}}\n{{See also|Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|British Empire in World War II}}\n\n===The Norway Debate and Chamberlain's resignation===\nAfter the [[Norwegian campaign|Allies failed to prevent]] the German occupation of Norway, the Commons held an open debate from 7 to 9 May on the government's conduct of the war.

He was called upon to wind up the debate, which placed him in the difficult position of having to defend the government without damaging his own prestige.{{sfn|Shakespeare|2017|pp=299\u2013300}} Although the government won the vote, its majority was drastically reduced amid calls for a national government to be formed.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=582}}\n\nIn the early hours of 10 May, German forces invaded Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as a prelude to their [[Battle of France|assault on France]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=583}} Since the division vote, Chamberlain had been trying to form a coalition but Labour declared on the Friday afternoon that they would not serve under his leadership, although they would accept another Conservative. The only two candidates were Churchill and [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], the Foreign Secretary. The matter had already been decided at a meeting on the 9th between Chamberlain, Halifax, Churchill, and [[David Margesson, 1st Viscount Margesson|David Margesson]], the government [[Chief Whip]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=583}} Halifax had admitted that he could not govern effectively as a member of the House of Lords and so Chamberlain advised the King to send for Churchill, who became prime minister.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=586}} His first act was to write to Chamberlain and thank him for his support.<ref>{{cite book |last=Self |first=Robert |title=Neville Chamberlain: A Biography |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |page=431 |isbn=978-0-75-465615-9}}</ref>\n\nChurchill later wrote of feeling a profound sense of relief in that he now had authority over the whole scene.

In practice, these five were augmented by the service chiefs and ministers who attended the majority of meetings.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=587\u2013588}}{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|pp=26\u201329}} The cabinet changed in size and membership as the war progressed and there were significant additions later in 1940 when it was increased to eight after Churchill, Attlee and Greenwood were joined by [[Ernest Bevin]] as [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour and National Service]]; [[Anthony Eden]] as Foreign Secretary \u2013 replacing Halifax, who was sent to Washington D.C. as ambassador to the United States; [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] as [[Minister of Aircraft Production]]; Sir [[Kingsley Wood]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|Sir John Anderson]] as Lord President of the Council \u2013 replacing Chamberlain who died in November (Anderson later became Chancellor after Kingsley Wood's death in September 1943). In response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, Churchill created and took the additional position of [[Minister of Defence (UK)|Minister of Defence]], making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in British history.{{sfn|Blake|Louis|1993|pp=264, 270\u2013271}}\n\nChurchill wanted people he knew and trusted to take part in government. Among these were personal friends like Beaverbrook and [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]], who became the government's scientific advisor.{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|p=41}} Lindemann was one of several outside exports drafted in and these \"technocrats\" fulfilled vital functions, especially on the Home Front.{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|p=41}} Churchill would proudly proclaim that his government, in the interests of national unity, was the most broadly based in British political history as it spanned far right to far left by including such figures as [[George Lloyd, 1st Baron Lloyd|Lord Lloyd]] on the right and [[Ellen Wilkinson]] on the left.{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|p=41}}\n\n====Resolve to fight on====\n{{main|War cabinet crisis, May 1940}}\nAt the end of May, with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] in retreat to [[Dunkirk]] and the [[Fall of France]] seemingly imminent, Halifax proposed that the government should explore the possibility of a negotiated peace settlement using [[Mussolini]] as an intermediary given that Italy was still neutral. There were [[War cabinet crisis, May 1940|several high-level meetings]] from 26 to 28 May, including two with the French premier [[Paul Reynaud]]. Churchill's resolve was to fight on, even if France capitulated, but his position remained precarious until Chamberlain resolved to support him. Churchill had the full support of the two Labour members but knew he could not survive as prime minister if both Chamberlain and Halifax were against him. In the end, by gaining the support of his outer cabinet, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax and won Chamberlain over. The essence of Churchill's argument was that, as he said, \"it was idle to think that, if we tried to make peace now, we should get better terms than if we fought it out\".<ref name=\"Schneer2015\">{{cite book|last=Schneer|first=Jonathan |title=Ministers at War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVIQBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT28|date=2015|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-614-2|pages=28\u201331}}</ref> He therefore concluded that the only option was to fight on though, at times, he personally was pessimistic about the chances of a British victory, as on 12 June 1940 when he told General [[Hastings Ismay]] that \"[y]ou and I will be dead in three months' time\".{{sfn|Blake|Louis|1993|pp=249, 252\u2013255}} Nonetheless, his use of rhetoric hardened public opinion against a peaceful resolution and prepared the British people for a long war.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=616\u2013646}}\n\n====Importance of Churchill's speeches====\n[[File:Churchill CCathedral H 14250.jpg|thumb|Churchill walks through the ruins of [[Coventry Cathedral]] with [[Alfred Robert Grindlay]], 1941]]\n[[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of 338,226 Allied servicemen from Dunkirk, ended on Tuesday, 4 June when the French rearguard surrendered. The total was far in excess of expectations and it gave rise to a popular view that Dunkirk had been a miracle, and even a victory.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=597}} Churchill himself referred to \"a miracle of deliverance\" in his \"[[We shall fight on the beaches]]\" speech to the Commons that afternoon, though he shortly reminded everyone that: \"We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory.

His first as prime minister was the famous \"I have nothing to offer but [[blood, toil, tears, and sweat]]\" speech. One historian has called its effect on Parliament \"electrifying\". The House of Commons that had ignored him during the 1930s \"was now listening, and cheering\".{{sfn|Blake|Louis|1993|pp=513, 515\u2013517}} Churchill followed that closely with two other equally famous speeches, given just before the [[Battle of Britain]].

Later that day, he accepted the King's invitation to form a new government, known officially as the [[National Government (United Kingdom)#the caretaker government of 1945|National Government]], like the Conservative-dominated coalition of the 1930s, but in practice known as the [[Churchill caretaker ministry]]. The government contained Conservatives, [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberals]] and a few non-party figures such as [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|Sir John Anderson]] and [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Lord Woolton]], but not Labour or [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Archibald Sinclair]]'s [[Liberal Party (UK)|Official Liberals]].

Clementine, who together with their daughter Mary had been at the count at Churchill's constituency in Essex (although unopposed by the major parties, Churchill had been returned with a much-reduced majority against an independent candidate), returned to meet her husband for lunch. To her suggestion that election defeat might be \"a blessing in disguise\" he retorted that \"at the moment it seems very effectively disguised\". That afternoon Churchill's doctor Lord Moran (so he later recorded in his book ''The Struggle for Survival'') commiserated with him on the \"ingratitude\" of the British public, to which Churchill replied \"I wouldn't call it that. They have had a very hard time.\" Having lost the election, despite enjoying much support amongst the British population, he resigned as Prime Minister that evening, this time handing over to a Labour Government.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=57, 107\u2013109}} Many reasons for his defeat have been given, key among them being that a desire for post-war reform was widespread amongst the population and that the man who had led Britain in war was not seen as the man to lead the nation in peace.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=789\u2013794}} Although the Conservative Party was unpopular, many electors appear to have wanted Churchill to continue as Prime Minister whatever the outcome, or to have wrongly believed that this would be possible.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|p=113}}\n\nOn the morning of 27 July, Churchill held a farewell Cabinet.

Thereafter his condition deteriorated, and it was thought that he might not survive the weekend. Had Eden been fit, Churchill's premiership would most likely have been over.

These ministerial merits are not as common as might be thought.\"{{sfn|Rhodes James|1970|pp=33\u201334}}\n\n[[File:Winston churchil statue in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Churchill in Yael's Garden, [[Mishkenot Sha'ananim|Mishkanot Sha'ananim]], Jerusalem.]]\n\nChurchill's belief in the superiority of white Europeans, a widespread view among his contemporaries, has generated accusations of [[racism]].<ref name=\"heyden\">{{cite news|title=The 10 Greatest Controversies of Winston Churchill's Career |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29701767 |date=26 January 2015 |website=BBC News |last1=Heyden |first1=Tom |accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> His role in the Bengal Famine has been one source of particular criticism;<ref name=\"Churchill_hero_villain\"/> the historian Walter Reid has stated Churchill was \"very wrong in relation to India, where his conduct fell far below his usual level.\"<ref name=\"Churchill_look_Raj\">{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/A-new-look-at-the-Raj/article16932292.ece |title=A New Look at the Raj |website=The Hindu |first=Varma |last=Nikhil |date=23 December 2016 |accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1966 and 1988, an eight-volume biography of Churchill was published, started by Randolph Churchill but completed largely by [[Martin Gilbert]] after the former's death in 1968.{{sfnm|1a1=Rhodes James|1y=1970|1p=x|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=xv}} Rhodes James suggested that this [[official biography]] was a \"labour of love\" for Randolph Churchill, and that \"what was so admirable in the son, was ... less desirable in the biographer.\"{{sfn|Rhodes James|1970|p=x}} By 1980, there was already a very extensive published array of material on Churchill.{{sfn|Addison|1980|p=23}}\n\nChurchill's legacy continues to stir intense debate among writers and historians.<ref name=\"Churchill_hero_villain\"/> In 1980, Addison noted that there are many people \"so prejudiced for or against Churchill\" that they had no interest in critically assessing him as a historical figure.{{sfn|Addison|1980|p=23}} In 2018, the broadcaster [[Afua Hirsch]] described encounters with two historians who were concerned that researching more controversial elements of Churchill's life would hinder their academic career.<ref name=\"hirsch\">{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/russia-propaganda-skripal-britain-churchill | title= If you talk about Russian propaganda, remember: Britain has myths too | work=The Guardian | date=21 March 2018 | accessdate=15 April 2018 | location=London | first=Afua | last=Hirsch}}</ref>\n\nChurchill has been honoured throughout the Commonwealth, particularly in Canada.

He was the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1940 to 1945, when he led Britain to victory in the [[Second World War]], and again from 1951 to 1955. Churchill represented five constituencies during his career as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP). Ideologically an [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] and [[British Empire|imperialist]], for most of his career he was a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which he led from 1940 to 1955, but from 1904 to 1924 was a member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].\n\n<!--Early life and career prior to the Second World War-->\nOf mixed [[English people|English]] and [[Americans|American]] parentage, Churchill was born in [[Oxfordshire]] to [[Spencer family|a wealthy, aristocratic family]]. He joined the [[British Army]] in 1895, and saw action in [[British Raj|British India]], the [[Mahdist War|Anglo\u2013Sudan War]], and the [[Second Boer War]], gaining fame as a [[war correspondent]] and writing books about his campaigns. Elected an MP in 1900, initially as a Conservative, he defected to the Liberals in 1904. In [[H. H. Asquith]]'s [[Liberal government, 1905\u20131915|Liberal government]], Churchill served as [[President of the Board of Trade]], [[Home Secretary]], and [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], championing [[Liberal welfare reforms|prison reform and workers' social security]]. During the [[First World War]], he oversaw the [[Gallipoli campaign|Gallipoli Campaign]]; after it proved a disaster, he resigned from government and served in the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1917, he returned to government under [[David Lloyd George]] as [[Minister of Munitions]], then as [[Secretary of State for War]] and [[Secretary of State for Air|Air]], and finally [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|for the Colonies]], overseeing the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and Britain's Middle East policy. After two years out of Parliament, he served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s [[Second Baldwin ministry|Conservative government]], returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the [[gold standard]] at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy.\n\n<!--Later life, the Second World War, and Cold War-->\nOut of office during the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the [[appeasement|growing threat]] from [[Nazi Germany]]. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1940 he became prime minister, replacing [[Neville Chamberlain]]. Churchill oversaw British involvement in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort against Germany and the [[Axis powers]], resulting in victory in 1945. His wartime leadership was widely praised, although acts like the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Bombing of Dresden]] and his wartime response to the [[Bengal famine of 1943|Bengal famine]] generated controversy. After the Conservatives' defeat in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], he became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Amid the developing [[Cold War]] with the [[Soviet Union]], he publicly warned of an \"[[Iron Curtain|iron curtain]]\" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. Re-elected Prime Minister in [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951]], his second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, including the [[Malayan Emergency]], [[Mau Mau Uprising]], [[Korean War]], and a UK-backed [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|Iranian coup]]. Domestically his government emphasised house-building and developed a nuclear weapon. In declining health, Churchill resigned as prime minister in 1955, although he remained an MP until [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]]. Upon his death in 1965, he was given a [[State funerals in the United Kingdom|state funeral]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Churchill remains popular in Britain and throughout [[Western world|the West]], where he is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's [[liberal democracy]] from the spread of [[fascism]]. Praised as a social reformer and accomplished writer, among his many awards was the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Conversely, his imperialist views and comments on race, as well as his sanctioning of human rights abuses in the suppression of [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] movements seeking independence from the [[British Empire]], have generated considerable controversy.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood and schooling: 1874\u20131895===\n[[File:Blenheim Palace from the Water Terraces October 2016.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blenheim Palace]], Churchill's ancestral home and his birthplace]]\nChurchill was born at the family's ancestral home, [[Blenheim Palace]] in [[Oxfordshire]], on 30 November 1874,{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=5}} at which time the United Kingdom was the dominant world power.{{sfn|Best|2001|p=1}} Direct descendants of the [[Dukes of Marlborough]], his family were among the highest levels of the British aristocracy,{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2pp=3, 5}} and thus he was born into the country's governing elite.{{sfnm|1a1=Best|1y=2001|1p=2|2a1=Haffner|2y=2003|2p=2}} His paternal grandfather, [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough]], had been a Member of Parliament (MP) for ten years, a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] who served in the government of Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]].{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1p=4|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2pp=7\u20138}} His own father, [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], had been elected Conservative MP for [[Woodstock (UK Parliament constituency)|Woodstock]] in 1873.{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Best|2y=2001|2p=3|3a1=Jenkins|3y=2001|3p=4|4a1=Robbins|4y=2014|4p=2}} His mother, [[Lady Randolph Churchill|Jennie Churchill]] (n\u00e9e Jerome), was from an American family whose substantial wealth derived from finance.{{sfnm|1a1=Best|1y=2001|1p=4|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2pp=5\u20136|3a1=Addison|3y=2005|3p=7}} The couple had met in August 1873, and were engaged three days later, marrying at the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Paris|British Embassy in Paris]] in April 1874.{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1pp=5, 7|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2p=9|3a1=Robbins|3y=2014|3p=2}} The couple lived beyond their income and were frequently in debt;{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=6\u20137}} according to the biographer [[Sebastian Haffner]], the family were \"rich by normal standards but poor by those of the rich\".{{sfn|Haffner|2003|p=15}}\n\n[[File:Churchill 1881 ZZZ 7555D.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Churchill, aged six, in 1881{{sfn|Haffner|2003|p=4}}]]\nIn 1876 John Spencer-Churchill was appointed [[Viceroy of Ireland]], with Randolph as his private secretary, resulting in the Churchill family's relocation to [[Dublin]], when [[History of Ireland (1801\u20131923)|the entirety of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2p=9}} It was here that Jennie's second son, [[John Strange Spencer-Churchill|Jack]], was born in 1880;{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=7|3a1=Addison|3y=2005|3p=10}} there has been speculation that Randolph was not his biological father.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=7}} Throughout much of the 1880s Randolph and Jennie were effectively estranged, and during this time she had many suitors.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=8}} Churchill had virtually no relationship with his father;{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1p=10|2a1=Haffner|2y=2003|2p=13}} referring to his mother, Churchill later stated that \"I loved her dearly\u2014but at a distance.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=8|3a1=Reagles|3a2=Larsen|3y=2013|3p=8}} His relationship with Jack was warm.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=7}} In Dublin, the brothers were cared for primarily by their nanny, [[Elizabeth Everest]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1pp=2\u20133|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=10|3a1=Reagles|3a2=Larsen|3y=2013|3p=8}} Churchill nicknamed her \"Woomany\",{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=16, 29}} and later wrote that \"She had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years I had lived.\"{{sfn|Best|2001|p=6}}\n\nAged seven, he began [[boarding school|boarding]] at [[St. George's School, Ascot|St. George's School]] in [[Ascot, Berkshire]];

In response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, Churchill created and took the additional position of [[Minister of Defence (UK)|Minister of Defence]], making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in British history.{{sfn|Blake|Louis|1993|pp=264, 270\u2013271}}\n\nChurchill wanted people he knew and trusted to take part in government.

There were [[War cabinet crisis, May 1940|several high-level meetings]] from 26 to 28 May, including two with the French premier [[Paul Reynaud]]. Churchill's resolve was to fight on, even if France capitulated, but his position remained precarious until Chamberlain resolved to support him. Churchill had the full support of the two Labour members but knew he could not survive as prime minister if both Chamberlain and Halifax were against him. In the end, by gaining the support of his outer cabinet, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax and won Chamberlain over.

Later that day, he accepted the King's invitation to form a new government, known officially as the [[National Government (United Kingdom)#the caretaker government of 1945|National Government]], like the Conservative-dominated coalition of the 1930s, but in practice known as the [[Churchill caretaker ministry]]. The government contained Conservatives, [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberals]] and a few non-party figures such as [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|Sir John Anderson]] and [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Lord Woolton]], but not Labour or [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Archibald Sinclair]]'s [[Liberal Party (UK)|Official Liberals]]. Although Churchill continued to carry out the functions of Prime Minister, including exchanging messages with the US administration about the upcoming [[Potsdam Conference]], he was not formally reappointed until 28 May.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=22\u201323, 27}}\n\nAlthough polling day was 5 July, the results of the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 election]] did not become known until 26 July, owing to the need to collect the votes of those serving overseas. Clementine, who together with their daughter Mary had been at the count at Churchill's constituency in Essex (although unopposed by the major parties, Churchill had been returned with a much-reduced majority against an independent candidate), returned to meet her husband for lunch. To her suggestion that election defeat might be \"a blessing in disguise\" he retorted that \"at the moment it seems very effectively disguised\". That afternoon Churchill's doctor Lord Moran (so he later recorded in his book ''The Struggle for Survival'') commiserated with him on the \"ingratitude\" of the British public, to which Churchill replied \"I wouldn't call it that. They have had a very hard time.\" Having lost the election, despite enjoying much support amongst the British population, he resigned as Prime Minister that evening, this time handing over to a Labour Government.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=57, 107\u2013109}} Many reasons for his defeat have been given, key among them being that a desire for post-war reform was widespread amongst the population and that the man who had led Britain in war was not seen as the man to lead the nation in peace.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=789\u2013794}} Although the Conservative Party was unpopular, many electors appear to have wanted Churchill to continue as Prime Minister whatever the outcome, or to have wrongly believed that this would be possible.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|p=113}}\n\nOn the morning of 27 July, Churchill held a farewell Cabinet. On the way out of the Cabinet Room he told Eden: \"Thirty years of my life have been passed in this room. I shall never sit in it again. You will, but I shall not\".

Being a strong proponent of Britain as an [[power in international relations|international power]], Churchill would often meet such moments with [[direct action]].

The Truman Administration was supporting the plans for a [[European Defence Community]] (EDC), hoping that this would allow controlled West German rearmament and enable American troop reductions. Churchill affected to believe that the proposed EDC would not work, scoffing at the supposed difficulties of language. Churchill asked in vain for a US military commitment to support Britain's position in Egypt and the Middle East (where the Truman Administration had recently pressured Attlee not to intervene against [[Mohammad Mosaddegh|Mossadeq]] in Iran); this did not meet with American approval\u2014the US expected British support to fight communism in [[Korean War|Korea]], but saw any US commitment to the Middle East as supporting British imperialism, and were unpersuaded that this would help prevent pro-Soviet regimes from coming to power.{{sfn|Charmley|1995|p=255}}\n\nBy early 1953, the Cabinet's foreign policy priority was [[Egypt]] and the nationalist, anti-imperialist [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|Egyptian Revolution]].

Egypt had been a [[History of Egypt under the British|British client state]], under varying degrees of control and military occupation, since 1883. In 1953 Britain, keen to restore friendly relations, agreed to terminate her rule in the Sudan by 1956 in return for Egypt's abandoning of her own claim over the region. In October 1954, Britain and Egypt would conclude an agreement on the phased evacuation of British troops from the Suez base, to the dismay\u2014privately shared by Churchill\u2014of the \"Suez Group\" of Conservative backbenchers.{{sfn|Charmley|1995|pp=261, 277, 285}}\n\nAfter Stalin's death, Churchill, the last of the wartime Big Three, wrote to [[Dwight D.

Eden wrote to his son on 10 April \"W gets daily older & is apt to ... waste a great deal of time ... the outside world has little idea how difficult that becomes. Please make me retire before I am 80!\" However, Eden's serious illness (he nearly died after a series of botched operations on his bile duct) allowed Churchill to take control of foreign affairs from April 1953.{{sfn|Charmley|1995|pp=263\u2013265}}<ref>Gilbert, Martin.

The US Embassy in London noted that this was a rare occasion on which Churchill did not mention Anglo-American solidarity in a speech. Ministers like [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] (acting Foreign Secretary) and [[Anthony Nutting|Nutting]] were concerned at the irritation caused to the Americans and the French, although [[Selwyn Lloyd]] supported Churchill's initiative, as did most Conservatives.

Despite being partially paralysed down one side, he presided over a Cabinet meeting the next morning without anybody noticing his incapacity. Thereafter his condition deteriorated, and it was thought that he might not survive the weekend. Had Eden been fit, Churchill's premiership would most likely have been over. News of this was kept from the public and from Parliament, who were told that Churchill was suffering from exhaustion. He went to his country home, Chartwell, to recuperate, and by the end of June he astonished his doctors by being able, dripping with perspiration, to lift himself upright from his chair. He joked that news of his illness had chased the trial of [[John Christie (murderer)|the serial killer John Christie]] off the front pages.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=846\u201357}}{{sfn|Charmley|1995|p=266}}{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=868\u2013871}}\n\n[[File:Churchill queen Elizabeth 1953.jpg|thumb|Churchill with Queen [[Elizabeth II]], [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], 10 February 1953.]]\nChurchill was still keen to pursue a meeting with the Soviets and was open to the idea of a reunified Germany. He refused to condemn the Soviet crushing of East Germany, commenting on 10 July 1953 that \"The Russians were surprisingly patient about the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|disturbances in East Germany]]\". He thought this might have been the reason for the removal of [[Lavrentiy Beria|Beria]].{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|p=863}} Churchill returned to public life in October 1953 to make a speech at the Conservative Party conference at [[Margate]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=868\u2013871}} In December 1953, Churchill met Eisenhower in Bermuda.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=936\u2013937}}\n\nChurchill was annoyed about friction between Eden and Dulles (June 1954). On the trip home from another Anglo-American conference, the diplomat [[Pierson Dixon]] compared [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat|US actions in Guatemala]] to Soviet policy in Korea and [[Greek Civil War|Greece]], causing Churchill to retort that Guatemala was a \"bloody place\" he'd \"never heard of\". Churchill was still keen for a trip to Moscow, and threatened to resign, provoking a crisis in the Cabinet when Lord Salisbury threatened to resign if Churchill had his way. In the end the Soviets proposed a five-power conference, which did not meet until after Churchill had retired. By the autumn Churchill was again postponing his resignation.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=1009\u201317}}{{sfn|Charmley|1995|pp=289\u2013291}}\n\nEden, now partially recovered from his operations, became a major figure on the world stage in 1954, helping to negotiate [[Geneva Conference (1954)|peace]] in [[First Indochina War|Indo-China]], an agreement with Egypt and to broker an agreement between the countries of Western Europe after the French rejection of the EDC.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=298\u2013300}} Aware that he was slowing down both physically and mentally, Churchill at last retired as prime minister in 1955 and was succeeded by Anthony Eden.

Despite the Conservative landslide, his own majority fell by more than a thousand. It is widely believed that as his mental and physical faculties decayed, he began to lose a battle he had supposedly long fought against depression. However, the nature, incidence and severity of Churchill's depression is uncertain.
