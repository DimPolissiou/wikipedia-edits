The [[canal]] cuts across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and is a [[Channel (geography)|conduit]] for maritime trade.  [[Canal lock]]s are at each end to lift [[ship]]s up to [[Gatun Lake]], an [[Reservoir|artificial lake]] created to reduce the amount of [[digging|excavation work]] required for the canal, 26&nbsp;m (85&nbsp;ft) [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]], and then lower the ships at the other end. The original locks are 32.5&nbsp;m (110&nbsp;ft) wide. A [[Panama Canal expansion project|third, wider lane of locks]] was [[construction|constructed]] between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, [[New Panamax|neo-Panamax]] ships, capable of handling more cargo.<ref name=AP062016/>\n\nThe construction of the Panama Canal is where the expression \"Another Day, Another Dollar\" comes from, as the workers were rumored to be paid a dollar a day for their labor.<ref name=AP062016/>\n\n[[France]] began work on the canal in 1881, but stopped because of engineering problems and a high worker [[mortality rate]]. The [[United States]] took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal on August 15, 1914. One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous [[Cape Horn]] route around the southernmost tip of [[South America]] via the [[Drake Passage]] or [[Strait of Magellan]] and the even less popular route through the [[Arctic Archipelago]] and the [[Bering Strait]].\n\n[[Colombia]], France, and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding [[Panama Canal Zone]] until the 1977 [[Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties]] provided for handover to Panama. After a period of joint American\u2013Panamanian control, in 1999, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government. It is now managed and operated by the government-owned [[Panama Canal Authority]].\n\n[[Yearly|Annual]] [[traffic]] has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, for a total of 333.7 million [[Measurement ton|Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons]].

The ill-fated [[Darien scheme]] was launched by the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] in 1698 to set up an overland [[trade route]]. Generally inhospitable conditions thwarted the effort and it was abandoned in April 1700.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinnaird.net/darien.htm|title=Darien Expedition|accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref>\n\nNumerous canals were built in other countries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The success of the [[Erie Canal]] in the United States in the 1820s and the collapse of the [[Spanish Empire]] in Latin America led to a surge of American interest in building an inter-oceanic canal. Beginning in 1826, US officials began negotiations with [[Gran Colombia]] (present-day [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Panama]]), hoping to gain a concession for the building of a canal. Jealous of their newly obtained independence and fearing that they would be dominated by an American presence, the president [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] and New Granada officials declined American offers. The new nation was politically unstable, and Panama rebelled several times during the 19th century.\n\nAnother effort was made in 1843. According to the ''New York Daily Tribune'', August 24, 1843, a contract was entered into by Barings of London and the [[Republic of New Granada]] for the construction of a canal across the [[Isthmus of Darien]] (Isthmus of Panama). They referred to it as the Atlantic and Pacific Canal, and it was a wholly British endeavor. It was expected to be completed in five years, but the plan was never carried out. At nearly the same time, other ideas were floated, including a canal (and/or a railroad) across Mexico's [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. Nothing came of that plan, either.<ref>[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030213/1843-08-24/ed-1/seq-/#date1=1836&index=1&rows=20&words=Lexington+Ship+ship&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=New+York&date2=1850&proxtext=lexington+ship&y=10&x=16&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1)]{{Dead link|date=June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, the [[Mallarino\u2013Bidlack Treaty]], negotiated between the US and [[The Republic of New Granada|New Granada]], granted the United States transit rights and the right to intervene militarily in the isthmus. In 1848, the [[California Gold Rush|discovery of gold in California]], on the West Coast of the United States, created great interest in a crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. [[William Henry Aspinwall|William H. Aspinwall]], the man who won the federal subsidy for the building and operating the Pacific mail steamships at around the same time, benefited from this discovery. Aspinwall's route included steamship legs from New York City to Panama and from Panama to California, with an overland portage through Panama. The route between California and Panama was soon frequently traveled, as it provided one of the fastest links between [[San Francisco, California]], and the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] cities, about 40 days' transit in total. Nearly all the gold that was shipped out of California went by the fast Panama route. Several new and larger paddle steamers were soon plying this new route, including unsubsidized steamship lines owned by [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] that required an overland route through [[Nicaragua]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt|first=T.J.|last=Stiles|date=2009|publisher=Knopf |isbn=9780375415425}}</ref>\n\nThe United States initiated construction in 1850 of the [[Panama Canal Railway|Panama Railroad]] (now called the Panama Railway) to cross the isthmus and it opened in 1855. This overland link became a vital piece of Western Hemisphere infrastructure, greatly facilitating trade and largely determining the later canal route, which was made parallel to it.\n\nAn all-water route between the oceans was still seen as the ideal solution, and in 1855 [[William Kennish]], a [[Isle of Man|Manx]]-born engineer working for the United States government, surveyed the isthmus and issued a report on a route for a proposed Panama Canal.<ref name=mw>{{Cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/worthies/p118.htm|title=p118-121 ch6 - Manx Worthies - William Kennish|website=www.isle-of-man.com}}</ref> His report was published as a book entitled ''The Practicability and Importance of a Ship Canal to Connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans''.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAwsAAAAYAAJ |title=The Practicability and Importance of a Ship Canal to Connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans |last1=Kelley |first1=Frederick M. |last2=) |first2=William Kennish (Civil Engineer |last3=Serrell |first3=Edward Wellman |year=1855 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1877, Armand Reclus, an officer with the [[French Navy]], and [[Lucien Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte-Wyse|Lucien Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte Wyse]], both engineers, surveyed the route and published a French proposal for a canal.<ref name=\"reclus\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Panama.html?id=wmwYAAAAYAAJ |first=G\u00e9rard |last=Fauconnier |title=Panama: Armand Reclus et le canal des deux oc\u00e9ans |publisher=University of Virginia reprint in French Panama Atlantica |year=2004 |isbn=9782843946684 }}</ref> French success in building the [[Suez Canal]], while a lengthy project, encouraged planning for one to cross the isthmus.{{sfn |McCullough |1977 |pp=58\u201359}}\n\n===French construction attempts, 1881\u20131894===\n[[File:Ferdinand de Lesseps by Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|Ferdinand de Lesseps]]\nThe first attempt to construct a canal through what was then [[Colombia]]'s province of Panama began on January 1, 1881.

He also re-established and enlarged the railway, which was to prove crucial in transporting millions of tons of soil from the cut through the mountains to the dam across the Chagres River.\n\n[[File:Roosevelt and the Canal.JPG|thumb|upright|President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sitting on a Bucyrus steam shovel at Culebra Cut, 1906]]\n[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|thumb|upright|Construction work on the [[Gaillard Cut]] is shown in this photograph from 1907.]]\n\nColonel [[William C. Gorgas]] had been appointed chief sanitation officer of the canal construction project in 1904. Gorgas implemented a range of measures to minimize the spread of deadly diseases, particularly [[yellow fever]] and [[malaria]], which had recently been shown to be mosquito-borne following the work of Dr. [[Carlos Finlay]] and Dr. [[Walter Reed]].{{sfn |McCullough |1977 |pp=405\u2013426}} Investment was made in extensive sanitation projects, including city water systems, fumigation of buildings, spraying of insect-breeding areas with oil and larvicide, installation of mosquito netting and window screens, and elimination of stagnant water. Despite opposition from the commission (one member said his ideas were barmy), Gorgas persisted, and when Stevens arrived, he threw his weight behind the project. After two years of extensive work, [[Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal|the mosquito-spread diseases were nearly eliminated]].{{sfn |McCullough |1977 |pp=466\u2013468}} Even after all that effort, about 5,600 workers died of disease and accidents during the US construction phase of the canal.\n\nIn 1905, a US engineering panel was commissioned to review the canal design, which had not been finalized. The panel recommended to President Roosevelt a sea-level canal, as had been attempted by the French. But in 1906 Stevens, who had seen the Chagres in full flood, was summoned to Washington; he declared a sea-level approach to be \"an entirely untenable proposition\". He argued in favor of a canal using a lock system to raise and lower ships from a large reservoir {{convert|85|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} above sea level. This would create both the largest dam ([[Gatun Dam]]) and the largest man-made lake ([[Gatun Lake]]) in the world at that time. The water to refill the locks would be taken from Gatun Lake by opening and closing enormous gates and valves and letting gravity propel the water from the lake. Gatun Lake would connect to the Pacific through the mountains at the [[Gaillard Cut|Gaillard]] (Culebra) Cut. Stevens successfully convinced Roosevelt of the necessity and feasibility of this alternative scheme.{{sfn |McCullough |1977 |pp=485\u2013489}}\n\nThe construction of a canal with locks required the excavation of more than {{convert|170000000|cuyd|m3|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} of material over and above the {{convert|30000000|cuyd|m3|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} excavated by the French. As quickly as possible, the Americans replaced or upgraded the old, unusable French equipment with new construction equipment that was designed for a much larger and faster scale of work. 102 large, railroad-mounted [[steam shovel]]s were purchased, 77 from [[Bucyrus-Erie]], and 25 from the [[Marion Power Shovel Company]]. These were joined by enormous steam-powered cranes, giant hydraulic [[rock crusher]]s, [[concrete mixer]]s, [[dredge]]s, and pneumatic power drills, nearly all of which were manufactured by new, extensive machine-building technology developed and built in the United States. The railroad also had to be comprehensively upgraded with heavy-duty, double-tracked rails over most of the line to accommodate new [[rolling stock]]. In many places, the new Gatun Lake flooded over the original rail line, and a new line had to be constructed above Gatun Lake's waterline.\n\n{{Panorama\n|image      = File:PanamaCanal1913a.jpg\n|height     = 165\n|caption    = Construction of locks on the Panama Canal, 1913\n}}\n\n===Goethals replaces Stevens as chief engineer===\n[[File:George W.

Effective April 1, 2016, this toll went from US$74 per loaded container to $60 per TEU capacity plus $30 per loaded container for a potential $90 per TEU when the ship is full. A Panamax container ship may carry up to {{TEU|4,400}}. The toll is calculated differently for passenger ships and for container ships carrying no cargo (\"in ballast\"). {{As of|2016|04|01|df=US}}, the ballast rate is US$60, down from US$65.60 per TEU.\n\nPassenger vessels in excess of 30,000 tons (PC/UMS), known popularly as [[cruise ships]], pay a rate based on the number of berths, that is, the number of passengers that can be accommodated in permanent beds. The per-berth charge since April 1, 2016 is $111 for unoccupied berths and $138 for occupied berths in the Panamax locks.

Each flight ascends from sea level directly to the level of Gatun Lake; the existing two-stage ascent at Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks was not replicated. The new lock chambers feature sliding gates, doubled for safety, and are {{convert|427|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} long, {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} wide, and {{convert|18.3|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} deep. This allows the transit of vessels with a beam of up to {{convert|49|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, an overall length of up to {{convert|366|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} and a draft of up to {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, equivalent to a container ship carrying around 12,000 containers, each {{convert|20|ft|m|sigfig=2|order=flip|abbr=on}} in length (TEU).\n\nThe new locks are supported by new approach channels, including a {{convert|6.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} channel at Miraflores from the locks to the Gaillard Cut, skirting Miraflores Lake. Each of these channels are {{convert|218|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} wide, which will require post-Panamax vessels to navigate the channels in one direction at a time. The Gaillard Cut and the channel through Gatun Lake were widened to at least {{convert|280|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} on the straight portions and at least {{convert|366|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} on the bends. The maximum level of Gatun Lake was raised from {{convert|26.7|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} to {{convert|27.1|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.\n\nEach flight of locks is accompanied by nine water reutilization basins (three per lock chamber), each basin being about {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} wide, {{convert|430|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} long and {{convert|5.50|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} deep. These gravity-fed basins allow 60 percent of the water used in each transit to be reused; the new locks consequently use 7 percent less water per transit than each of the existing lock lanes. The deepening of Gatun Lake and the raising of its maximum water level also provide capacity for significantly more water storage. These measures are intended to allow the expanded canal to operate without constructing new reservoirs.\n\nThe estimated cost of the project is {{USD|5.25 billion}}. The project was designed to allow for an anticipated growth in traffic from 280 million PC/UMS tons in 2005 to nearly 510 million PC/UMS tons in 2025. The expanded canal will have a maximum sustainable capacity of about 600 million PC/UMS tons per year. Tolls will continue to be calculated based on vessel tonnage, and in some cases depend on the locks used.\n\nAn article in the February 2007 issue of ''Popular Mechanics'' magazine described the plans for the canal expansion, focusing on the engineering aspects of the expansion project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/transportation/4212183.html |title=The Panama Canal's Ultimate Upgrade |first=Brad |last=Reagan |work=Popular Mechanics |date=February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206224605/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/transportation/4212183.html |archivedate=2007-02-06 }}</ref> There is also a follow-up article in the February 2010 issue of ''Popular Mechanics''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/transportation/4344444.html?page=1 |title=The Panama Canal Gets a New Lane |first=Andrew |last=Kaufman |work=Popular Mechanics |date=February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206005955/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/transportation/4344444.html?page=1 |archivedate=2010-02-06 }}</ref>\n\nOn September 3, 2007, thousands of [[Panamanians]] stood across from [[Para\u00edso, Panam\u00e1 Province|Para\u00edso]] Hill in Panama to witness a huge initial [[explosion]] and launch of the Expansion Program.

The [[canal]] cuts across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and is a [[Channel (geography)|conduit]] for maritime trade.  [[Canal lock]]s are at each end to lift [[ship]]s up to [[Gatun Lake]], an [[Reservoir|artificial lake]] created to reduce the amount of [[digging|excavation work]] required for the canal, 26&nbsp;m (85&nbsp;ft) [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]], and then lower the ships at the other end. The original locks are 32.5&nbsp;m (110&nbsp;ft) wide. A [[Panama Canal expansion project|third, wider lane of locks]] was [[construction|constructed]] between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, [[New Panamax|neo-Panamax]] ships, capable of handling more cargo.<ref name=AP062016/>\n\nThe construction of the Panama Canal is where the expression \"Another Day, Another Dollar\" comes from, as the workers were rumored to be paid a dollar a day for their labor.<ref name=AP062016/>\n\n[[France]] began work on the canal in 1881, but stopped because of engineering problems and a high worker [[mortality rate]]. The [[United States]] took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal on August 15, 1914. One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous [[Cape Horn]] route around the southernmost tip of [[South America]] via the [[Drake Passage]] or [[Strait of Magellan]] and the even less popular route through the [[Arctic Archipelago]] and the [[Bering Strait]].\n\n[[Colombia]], France, and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding [[Panama Canal Zone]] until the 1977 [[Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties]] provided for handover to Panama. After a period of joint American\u2013Panamanian control, in 1999, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government. It is now managed and operated by the government-owned [[Panama Canal Authority]].\n\n[[Yearly|Annual]] [[traffic]] has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, for a total of 333.7 million [[Measurement ton|Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons]].

The ill-fated [[Darien scheme]] was launched by the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] in 1698 to set up an overland [[trade route]]. Generally inhospitable conditions thwarted the effort and it was abandoned in April 1700.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinnaird.net/darien.htm|title=Darien Expedition|accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref>\n\nNumerous canals were built in other countries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The success of the [[Erie Canal]] in the United States in the 1820s and the collapse of the [[Spanish Empire]] in Latin America led to a surge of American interest in building an inter-oceanic canal. Beginning in 1826, US officials began negotiations with [[Gran Colombia]] (present-day [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Panama]]), hoping to gain a concession for the building of a canal. Jealous of their newly obtained independence and fearing that they would be dominated by an American presence, the president [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] and New Granada officials declined American offers. The new nation was politically unstable, and Panama rebelled several times during the 19th century.\n\nAnother effort was made in 1843. According to the ''New York Daily Tribune'', August 24, 1843, a contract was entered into by Barings of London and the [[Republic of New Granada]] for the construction of a canal across the [[Isthmus of Darien]] (Isthmus of Panama). They referred to it as the Atlantic and Pacific Canal, and it was a wholly British endeavor. It was expected to be completed in five years, but the plan was never carried out. At nearly the same time, other ideas were floated, including a canal (and/or a railroad) across Mexico's [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. Nothing came of that plan, either.<ref>[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030213/1843-08-24/ed-1/seq-/#date1=1836&index=1&rows=20&words=Lexington+Ship+ship&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=New+York&date2=1850&proxtext=lexington+ship&y=10&x=16&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1)]{{Dead link|date=June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, the [[Mallarino\u2013Bidlack Treaty]], negotiated between the US and [[The Republic of New Granada|New Granada]], granted the United States transit rights and the right to intervene militarily in the isthmus. In 1848, the [[California Gold Rush|discovery of gold in California]], on the West Coast of the United States, created great interest in a crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. [[William Henry Aspinwall|William H. Aspinwall]], the man who won the federal subsidy for the building and operating the Pacific mail steamships at around the same time, benefited from this discovery. Aspinwall's route included steamship legs from New York City to Panama and from Panama to California, with an overland portage through Panama. The route between California and Panama was soon frequently traveled, as it provided one of the fastest links between [[San Francisco, California]], and the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] cities, about 40 days' transit in total. Nearly all the gold that was shipped out of California went by the fast Panama route. Several new and larger paddle steamers were soon plying this new route, including unsubsidized steamship lines owned by [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] that required an overland route through [[Nicaragua]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt|first=T.J.|last=Stiles|date=2009|publisher=Knopf |isbn=9780375415425}}</ref>\n\nThe United States initiated construction in 1850 of the [[Panama Canal Railway|Panama Railroad]] (now called the Panama Railway) to cross the isthmus and it opened in 1855. This overland link became a vital piece of Western Hemisphere infrastructure, greatly facilitating trade and largely determining the later canal route, which was made parallel to it.\n\nAn all-water route between the oceans was still seen as the ideal solution, and in 1855 [[William Kennish]], a [[Isle of Man|Manx]]-born engineer working for the United States government, surveyed the isthmus and issued a report on a route for a proposed Panama Canal.<ref name=mw>{{Cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/worthies/p118.htm|title=p118-121 ch6 - Manx Worthies - William Kennish|website=www.isle-of-man.com}}</ref> His report was published as a book entitled ''The Practicability and Importance of a Ship Canal to Connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans''.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAwsAAAAYAAJ |title=The Practicability and Importance of a Ship Canal to Connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans |last1=Kelley |first1=Frederick M. |last2=) |first2=William Kennish (Civil Engineer |last3=Serrell |first3=Edward Wellman |year=1855 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1877, Armand Reclus, an officer with the [[French Navy]], and [[Lucien Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte-Wyse|Lucien Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte Wyse]], both engineers, surveyed the route and published a French proposal for a canal.<ref name=\"reclus\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Panama.html?id=wmwYAAAAYAAJ |first=G\u00e9rard |last=Fauconnier |title=Panama: Armand Reclus et le canal des deux oc\u00e9ans |publisher=University of Virginia reprint in French Panama Atlantica |year=2004 |isbn=9782843946684 }}</ref> French success in building the [[Suez Canal]], while a lengthy project, encouraged planning for one to cross the isthmus.{{sfn |McCullough |1977 |pp=58\u201359}}\n\n===French construction attempts, 1881\u20131894===\n[[File:Ferdinand de Lesseps by Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|Ferdinand de Lesseps]]\nThe first attempt to construct a canal through what was then [[Colombia]]'s province of Panama began on January 1, 1881.

Gorgas]]\n\nThe US formally took control of the canal property on May 4, 1904, inheriting from the French a depleted workforce and a vast jumble of buildings, infrastructure, and equipment, much of it in poor condition. A US government commission, the [[Isthmian Canal Commission]] (ICC), was established to oversee construction; it was given control of the Panama Canal Zone, over which the United States exercised sovereignty.{{sfn |McCullough |1977 |pp=273\u2013274}} The commission reported directly to [[Secretary of War]] [[William Howard Taft]] and was directed to avoid the inefficiency and corruption that had plagued the French 15 years earlier.\n\nOn May 6, 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed [[John Findley Wallace]], formerly chief engineer and finally general manager of the [[Illinois Central Railroad]], as chief engineer of the Panama Canal Project. Overwhelmed by the disease-plagued country and forced to use often dilapidated French infrastructure and equipment,{{sfn |McCullough |1977 |p=440}} as well as being frustrated by the overly bureaucratic ICC, Wallace resigned abruptly in June 1905.{{sfn |McCullough |1977 |p=457}} He was succeeded by [[John Frank Stevens]], a self-educated engineer who had built the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railroad]].{{sfn |McCullough |1977 |pp=459\u2013462}} Stevens was not a member of the ICC; he increasingly viewed its bureaucracy as a serious hindrance, bypassing the commission and sending requests and demands directly to the Roosevelt administration in Washington, DC.\n\nOne of Stevens' first achievements in Panama was in building and rebuilding the housing, cafeterias, hotels, water systems, repair shops, warehouses, and other infrastructure needed by the thousands of incoming workers. Stevens began the recruitment effort to entice thousands of workers from the United States and other areas to come to the Canal Zone to work, and tried to provide accommodation in which the incoming workers could work and live in reasonable safety and comfort. He also re-established and enlarged the railway, which was to prove crucial in transporting millions of tons of soil from the cut through the mountains to the dam across the Chagres River.\n\n[[File:Roosevelt and the Canal.JPG|thumb|upright|President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sitting on a Bucyrus steam shovel at Culebra Cut, 1906]]\n[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|thumb|upright|Construction work on the [[Gaillard Cut]] is shown in this photograph from 1907.]]\n\nColonel [[William C. Gorgas]] had been appointed chief sanitation officer of the canal construction project in 1904. Gorgas implemented a range of measures to minimize the spread of deadly diseases, particularly [[yellow fever]] and [[malaria]], which had recently been shown to be mosquito-borne following the work of Dr. [[Carlos Finlay]] and Dr. [[Walter Reed]].{{sfn |McCullough |1977 |pp=405\u2013426}} Investment was made in extensive sanitation projects, including city water systems, fumigation of buildings, spraying of insect-breeding areas with oil and larvicide, installation of mosquito netting and window screens, and elimination of stagnant water. Despite opposition from the commission (one member said his ideas were barmy), Gorgas persisted, and when Stevens arrived, he threw his weight behind the project. After two years of extensive work, [[Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal|the mosquito-spread diseases were nearly eliminated]].{{sfn |McCullough |1977 |pp=466\u2013468}} Even after all that effort, about 5,600 workers died of disease and accidents during the US construction phase of the canal.\n\nIn 1905, a US engineering panel was commissioned to review the canal design, which had not been finalized. The panel recommended to President Roosevelt a sea-level canal, as had been attempted by the French. But in 1906 Stevens, who had seen the Chagres in full flood, was summoned to Washington; he declared a sea-level approach to be \"an entirely untenable proposition\". He argued in favor of a canal using a lock system to raise and lower ships from a large reservoir {{convert|85|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} above sea level. This would create both the largest dam ([[Gatun Dam]]) and the largest man-made lake ([[Gatun Lake]]) in the world at that time. The water to refill the locks would be taken from Gatun Lake by opening and closing enormous gates and valves and letting gravity propel the water from the lake. Gatun Lake would connect to the Pacific through the mountains at the [[Gaillard Cut|Gaillard]] (Culebra) Cut. Stevens successfully convinced Roosevelt of the necessity and feasibility of this alternative scheme.{{sfn |McCullough |1977 |pp=485\u2013489}}\n\nThe construction of a canal with locks required the excavation of more than {{convert|170000000|cuyd|m3|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} of material over and above the {{convert|30000000|cuyd|m3|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} excavated by the French. As quickly as possible, the Americans replaced or upgraded the old, unusable French equipment with new construction equipment that was designed for a much larger and faster scale of work. 102 large, railroad-mounted [[steam shovel]]s were purchased, 77 from [[Bucyrus-Erie]], and 25 from the [[Marion Power Shovel Company]]. These were joined by enormous steam-powered cranes, giant hydraulic [[rock crusher]]s, [[concrete mixer]]s, [[dredge]]s, and pneumatic power drills, nearly all of which were manufactured by new, extensive machine-building technology developed and built in the United States. The railroad also had to be comprehensively upgraded with heavy-duty, double-tracked rails over most of the line to accommodate new [[rolling stock]]. In many places, the new Gatun Lake flooded over the original rail line, and a new line had to be constructed above Gatun Lake's waterline.\n\n{{Panorama\n|image      = File:PanamaCanal1913a.jpg\n|height     = 165\n|caption    = Construction of locks on the Panama Canal, 1913\n}}\n\n===Goethals replaces Stevens as chief engineer===\n[[File:George W.

The entrance runs 5\u00bd mi (8.4&nbsp;km). It provides a deepwater port ([[Crist\u00f3bal, Col\u00f3n|Crist\u00f3bal]]), with facilities like multimodal cargo exchange (to and from train) and the [[Col\u00f3n Free Trade Zone]] (a [[free port]]).\n* A {{convert|3.2|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=1}} channel forms the approach to the locks from the Atlantic side.\n* The Gatun Locks, a three-stage flight of locks 1\u00bc mi (1.9&nbsp;km) long, lifts ships to the Gatun Lake level, some {{convert|87|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} above sea level.\n* [[Gatun Lake]], an artificial lake formed by the building of the Gatun Dam, carries vessels {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} across the isthmus.

At the time it was formed, Gatun Lake was the largest human-made lake in the world. The impassable rainforest around the lake has been the best defense of the Panama Canal. Today these areas remain practically unscathed by human interference and are one of the few accessible areas where various native Central American animal and plant species can be observed undisturbed in their natural habitat.\n\nThe largest island on Gatun Lake is [[Barro Colorado Island]]. It was established for scientific study when the lake was formed, and is operated by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. Many important scientific and biological discoveries of the tropical animal and plant kingdom originated here. Gatun Lake covers about {{convert|180|sqmi|km2|order=flip}}, a vast tropical ecological zone and part of the Atlantic Forest Corridor. Ecotourism on the lake has become an industry for Panamanians.\n\nGatun Lake also provides drinking water for Panama City and [[Col\u00f3n, Panama|Col\u00f3n]]. Fishing is one of the primary recreational pursuits on Gatun Lake.

In 1908, the [[United States Navy]] requested that an increased width of at least {{convert|36|m|ft|abbr=on}} to allow the passage of US naval ships.

Effective April 1, 2016, this toll went from US$74 per loaded container to $60 per TEU capacity plus $30 per loaded container for a potential $90 per TEU when the ship is full. A Panamax container ship may carry up to {{TEU|4,400}}. The toll is calculated differently for passenger ships and for container ships carrying no cargo (\"in ballast\"). {{As of|2016|04|01|df=US}}, the ballast rate is US$60, down from US$65.60 per TEU.\n\nPassenger vessels in excess of 30,000 tons (PC/UMS), known popularly as [[cruise ships]], pay a rate based on the number of berths, that is, the number of passengers that can be accommodated in permanent beds. The per-berth charge since April 1, 2016 is $111 for unoccupied berths and $138 for occupied berths in the Panamax locks. Started in 2007, this fee has greatly increased the tolls for such ships.<ref>Panama Canal Toll Table http://www.pancanal.com/eng/op/tariff/1010-0000-Rev20160414.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Passenger vessels of less than 30,000 tons or less than 33 tons per passenger are charged according to the same per-ton schedule as are freighters. Almost all major cruise ships have more than 33 tons per passenger; the rule of thumb for cruise line comfort is generally given as a minimum of 40 tons per passenger.\n\nMost other types of vessel pay a toll per [[tonnage|PC/UMS net ton]], in which one \"ton\" is actually a volume of {{convert|100|cuft|m3|2}}. (The calculation of [[tonnage]] for commercial vessels is quite complex.) {{As of|2016|alt=As of fiscal year 2016}}, this toll is US$5.25 per ton for the first 10,000 tons, US$5.14 per ton for the next 10,000 tons, and US$5.06 per ton thereafter.  As with container ships, reduced tolls are charged for freight ships \"in ballast\", $4.19, $4.12, $4.05 respectively.\n\nOn 1 April 2016, a more complicated toll system was introduced, having the neopanamax locks at a higher rate in some cases, natural gas transport as a new separate category and other changes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/op/tariff/index.html|title=Maritime Services - PanCanal.com|website=www.pancanal.com}}</ref>\nAs of October 1, 2017, there are modified tolls and categories of tolls in effect.<ref>http://www.pancanal.com/peajes/pdf/2018/2018-ApprovedTolls.pdf</ref>\nSmall (less than 125&nbsp;ft) vessels up to 583 PC/UMS net tons when carrying passengers or cargo, or up to 735 PC/UMS net tons when in ballast, or up to 1,048 fully loaded displacement tons, are assessed minimum tolls based upon their [[length overall]], according to the following table (as of 29 April 2015):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Each flight ascends from sea level directly to the level of Gatun Lake; the existing two-stage ascent at Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks was not replicated. The new lock chambers feature sliding gates, doubled for safety, and are {{convert|427|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} long, {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} wide, and {{convert|18.3|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} deep. This allows the transit of vessels with a beam of up to {{convert|49|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, an overall length of up to {{convert|366|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} and a draft of up to {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, equivalent to a container ship carrying around 12,000 containers, each {{convert|20|ft|m|sigfig=2|order=flip|abbr=on}} in length (TEU).\n\nThe new locks are supported by new approach channels, including a {{convert|6.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} channel at Miraflores from the locks to the Gaillard Cut, skirting Miraflores Lake. Each of these channels are {{convert|218|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} wide, which will require post-Panamax vessels to navigate the channels in one direction at a time. The Gaillard Cut and the channel through Gatun Lake were widened to at least {{convert|280|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} on the straight portions and at least {{convert|366|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} on the bends. The maximum level of Gatun Lake was raised from {{convert|26.7|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} to {{convert|27.1|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.\n\nEach flight of locks is accompanied by nine water reutilization basins (three per lock chamber), each basin being about {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} wide, {{convert|430|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} long and {{convert|5.50|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} deep. These gravity-fed basins allow 60 percent of the water used in each transit to be reused; the new locks consequently use 7 percent less water per transit than each of the existing lock lanes. The deepening of Gatun Lake and the raising of its maximum water level also provide capacity for significantly more water storage. These measures are intended to allow the expanded canal to operate without constructing new reservoirs.\n\nThe estimated cost of the project is {{USD|5.25 billion}}. The project was designed to allow for an anticipated growth in traffic from 280 million PC/UMS tons in 2005 to nearly 510 million PC/UMS tons in 2025.

The contract resulted in $100 million in dredging works over the next few years for the Belgian company and a great deal of work for its construction division.

The internal structure was made of three spars, linked with cantilevers and a skin of plywood. The wing had a [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] of 2\u00b0 15'. [[Aileron]]s were capable of rotating through +13/-26\u00b0, and were used together with the flaps in low-speed flight and in takeoff.\nIts capabilities were significantly greater than its predecessor, the [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79|SM.79]], with over 1,850&nbsp;kW (2,800&nbsp;hp) available and a high [[wing loading]] that gave it characteristics not dissimilar to a large [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]].\nThe engines fitted to the main bomber version were two 750&nbsp;kW (1000&nbsp;hp) [[IAR K14]] radials, equipped with variable-pitch, all-metal three-bladed propellers. Speeds attained were around 430&nbsp;km/h (270&nbsp;mph) at 4,250&nbsp;m (13,940&nbsp;ft), with a relatively low practical ceiling of 6,500&nbsp;m (21,330&nbsp;ft). Cruise speed was 373&nbsp;km/h (232&nbsp;mph) at 5,000&nbsp;m (16,400&nbsp;ft), but the best cruise speed was 259&nbsp;km/h/161&nbsp;mph (60% power). The landing was characterized by a 200&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph) final approach with the slats extended, slowing to 145&nbsp;km/h (90&nbsp;mph) with extension of flaps, and finally the run over the field with only 200&nbsp;m (656&nbsp;ft) needed to land (2,050&nbsp;rpm, 644&nbsp;Hg <!-- is this mmHg or inHg? --> pressure). With full power available and flaps set for takeoff, the SM.79 could be airborne within 300&nbsp;m (980&nbsp;ft).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n==Variants==\n\n;S-79B\n:Romanian designation of the Savoia-Marchetti SM.79B bombers with 2 x [[IAR K14]] 1000 HP engine.
