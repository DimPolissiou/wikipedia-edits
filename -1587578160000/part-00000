All events and gatherings of three people or more (that are not from the same household) are banned until 1 September. Furthermore, in public space a distance of at least 1.5 metres between people not from the same household must be observed, and shops and other venues are to enforce this distancing among their visitors. Fines will be issued to those not complying with the new rules. Companies may face a fine up to \u20ac4,000, individuals risk a fine up to \u20ac400. Prime Minister [[Mark Rutte]] repeated his call to keep distance from each other.<ref name=\"social distancing\"/>\nFinal examinations of secondary school were cancelled on 24 March.<ref name=\"exam cancellations\"/> Other measures were that schools and day-cares were closed, except for children whose parents work in the 'vital' sectors, like health care. People were required to work from home as much as possible. These measures also resulted in modified schedules for public transport, as much less transportation of individuals was necessary. \n\n==Testing==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2020}}\nBy mid-March, the country could test about 1,000 samples per day, which is less than the capabilities of other European countries.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Newmark |first1=Zack |title=Coronavirus cases surge to 3,631 as 30 more Dutch patients die |url=https://nltimes.nl/2020/03/21/coronavirus-cases-surge-3631-30-dutch-patients-die |work=NL Times |date=21 March 2020}}</ref> This also explains a relatively large ratio of the number of deaths to the number of confirmed cases.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waster |first1=Jeroen |title=Groeiende kritiek experts op gebrek aan testen in Nederland |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/03/20/groeiende-kritiek-experts-op-gebrek-aan-testen-in-nederland-a3994452 |date=20 March 2020 |language=Dutch}}</ref> As of 25 March, 2,500 samples have been tested daily and a total number of 38,000 tests performed.

He was the Roman equivalent of the Greek [[divinity|divine]] [[hero]] [[Heracles]], who was the son of [[Zeus]] (Roman equivalent [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]) and the mortal [[Alcmene]]. In [[classical mythology]], Hercules is famous for his strength and for his numerous far-ranging adventures.\n\nThe Romans adapted the Greek hero's [[iconography]] and myths for their literature and art under the name ''Hercules''. In later [[Western art]] and literature and in [[popular culture]], ''Hercules'' is more commonly used than ''Heracles'' as the name of the hero. Hercules was a multifaceted figure with contradictory characteristics, which enabled later artists and writers to pick and choose how to represent him.<ref>\"Hercules,\" in ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 426.</ref> This article provides an introduction to representations of Hercules in the [[classical tradition|later tradition]].\n\n==Mythology==\n\n===Birth and early life===\nAlthough he was seen as the champion of the weak and a great protector, Hercules' personal problems started at birth. Hera sent two witches to prevent the birth, but they were tricked by one of [[Alcmene]]'s servants and sent to another room. Hera then sent [[Snake| serpents]] to kill him in his cradle, but Hercules strangled them both. In one version of the myth, Alcmene abandoned her baby in the woods in order to protect him from Hera's wrath, but he was found by the goddess Athena who brought him to Hera, claiming he was an orphan child left in the woods who needed nourishment. Hera suckled Hercules at her own breast until the infant bit her nipple, at which point she pushed him away, spilling her milk across the night sky and so forming the [[Milky Way]]. She then gave the infant back to Athena and told her to take care of the baby herself. In feeding the child from her own breast, the goddess inadvertently imbued him with further strength and power.\n\n===The 12 Labours===\n[[File:Antonio del Pollaiolo - Ercole e l'Idra e Ercole e Anteo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Hercules and the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]'' (c. 1475) by [[Antonio del Pollaiuolo]]; the hero wears his characteristic lionskin and wields a club]]\n[[File:Heracles and the Erymantian boar.jpg|thumb|upright|220px|Hercules capturing the [[Erymanthian Boar]], by [[:es:Jos\u00e9 Manuel F\u00e9lix Magdalena|J.M.

One cycle of these adventures became [[Western canon|canonical]] as the \"Twelve Labours\", but the list has variations. One traditional order of the labours is found in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' as follows:<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 2.5.1\u20132.5.12.</ref>\n# Slay the [[Nemean lion|Nemean Lion]].\n# Slay the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]].\n# Capture the [[Ceryneian Hind|Golden Hind of Artemis]].\n# Capture the [[Erymanthian Boar]].\n# Clean the [[Augeas|Augean]] stables in a single day.\n# Slay the [[Stymphalian birds|Stymphalian Birds]].\n# Capture the [[Cretan Bull]].\n# Steal the [[Mares of Diomedes]].\n# Obtain the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], Queen of the [[Amazons]].\n# Obtain the cattle of the monster [[Geryon]].\n# Steal the apples of the [[Hesperides]].\n# Capture and bring back [[Cerberus]].\n\n===Side adventures===\nHercules had a greater number of \"[[Heracles#Further adventures|deeds on the side]]\" ''(parerga)'' that have been popular subjects for art, including:<!--the following are organized chronologically by their creation as art works, not in any order pertaining to Hercules' deeds-->\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Side adventures\">\nFile:Hercules killing Cacus at his Cave.jpg|Killing a fire-breathing [[Cacus]] ([[Sebald Beham]], 1545)\nFile:Taten des Herakles dt 16Jh Atlas.jpg|Holding up the sky for [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] (based on [[Heinrich Aldegrever]], 1550)\nFile:Annibale Fontana - Plaque with Hercules and Achelous - Walters 4171.jpg|Wrestling with [[Achelous]] (16th-century plaque)\nFile:Herakles Antaeus Couder decoration Louvre INV3378.jpg|Fighting the giant [[Antaeus]] ([[Auguste Couder]], 1819)\nFile:L'Enl\u00e8vement, par Paul C\u00e9zanne.jpg|Retrieving [[Alcestis]] from the underworld ([[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], 1867)\nFile:Prometheus and Hercules.jpg|Freeing [[Prometheus]] ([[Christian Griepenkerl]], 1878)\n</gallery>\n\n===Death===\n{{Main article||Heracles#Death}}\n\n==Roman era==\n{{Main article|Hercules in ancient Rome|Heracles}}\n\n[[File:Herakles snake Musei Capitolini MC247.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Baby Hercules strangling a [[snake]] sent to kill him in his [[Bassinet|cradle]] (Roman marble, 2nd century CE, in the [[Capitoline Museums]] of [[Rome]], Italy).]]\n\nThe [[Latin]] name ''Hercules'' was borrowed through [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], where it is represented variously as [[Hercle|Heracle]], Hercle, and other forms. Hercules was a favorite subject for [[Etruscan art]], and appears often on [[bronze mirror]]s. The Etruscan form ''Herceler''<!--is this right?--> derives from the Greek ''Heracles'' via [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]]. A mild oath invoking Hercules (''Hercule!'' or ''Mehercle!'') was a common [[interjection]] in [[Classical Latin]].<ref>W. M. Lindsay, \"Mehercle and Herc(v)lvs. [Mehercle and Herc(u)lus]\" ''The Classical Quarterly'' '''12'''.2 (April 1918:58).</ref>\n\nHercules had a number of [[Roman mythology|myths]] that were distinctly Roman. One of these is Hercules' defeat of [[Cacus]], who was terrorizing the countryside of Rome. The hero was associated with the [[Aventine Hill]] through his son [[Aventinus (mythology)|Aventinus]]. [[Mark Antony]] considered him a personal patron god, as did the emperor [[Commodus]]. Hercules received various forms of [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious veneration]], including as a [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|deity concerned with children and childbirth]], in part because of myths about his precocious infancy, and in part because he fathered countless children.

Cool 1986), mostly made of gold, shaped like wooden clubs. A specimen found in [[K\u00f6ln-Nippes]] bears the inscription <small>\"DEO HER</small>[culi]\", confirming the association with Hercules.\n\nIn the 5th to 7th centuries, during the [[Migration Period]], the amulet is theorized to have rapidly spread from the [[Elbe Germanic]] area across Europe. These Germanic \"[[Thor|Donar's Clubs]]\" were made from deer antler, bone or wood, more rarely also from bronze or precious metals. The amulet type is replaced by the [[Viking Age]] [[Mj\u00f6lnir|Thor's hammer]] pendants in the course of the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]] from the 8th to 9th century.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Medieval mythography==\n[[File:Histoires de Troyes - Nemeian Lion.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hercules and the [[Nemean lion]] in the 15th-century ''[[Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye|Histoires de Troyes]]'']]\n\nAfter the Roman Empire became [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christianized]], mythological narratives were often reinterpreted as [[allegory]], influenced by the philosophy of [[late antiquity]]. In the 4th century, [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] had described Hercules' return from the underworld as representing his ability to overcome earthly desires and vices, or the earth itself as a consumer of bodies.<ref>[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+6.395&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053 6.395]; Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433\u20131177'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 91.</ref> In medieval mythography, Hercules was one of the heroes seen as a strong role model who demonstrated both valor and wisdom, while the monsters he battles were regarded as moral obstacles.<ref>Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', pp. 168, 218, 413.</ref> One [[glossator]] noted that when [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules became a constellation]], he showed that strength was necessary to gain entrance to Heaven.<ref>Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', p. 219.</ref>\n\nMedieval mythography was written almost entirely in Latin, and original Greek texts were little used as sources for Hercules' myths.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Renaissance mythography==\n[[File:Henry IV en Herculeus terrassant l Hydre de Lerne cad La ligue Catholique Atelier Toussaint Dubreuil circa 1600.jpg|thumb|right|King [[Henry IV of France]] depicted as Hercules vanquishing the [[Lernaean Hydra]] (i.e. the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]), by [[Toussaint Dubreuil]], {{circa|1600}}]]\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] and the invention of the [[printing press]] brought a renewed interest in and publication of Greek literature. Renaissance mythography drew more extensively on the Greek tradition of Heracles, typically under the Romanized name Hercules, or the alternate name [[Heracles|Alcides]]. In a chapter of his book ''Mythologiae'' (1567), the influential mythographer [[Natale Conti]] collected and summarized an extensive range of myths concerning the birth, adventures, and death of the hero under his Roman name Hercules. Conti begins his lengthy chapter on Hercules with an overview description that continues the moralizing impulse of the Middle Ages:\n<blockquote>\nHercules, who subdued and destroyed monsters, bandits, and criminals, was justly famous and renowned for his great courage. His great and glorious reputation was worldwide, and so firmly entrenched that he'll always be remembered. In fact the ancients honored him with his own temples, altars, ceremonies, and priests. But it was his wisdom and great soul that earned those honors; noble blood, physical strength, and political power just aren't good enough.<ref>[[Natale Conti]], ''Mythologiae'' Book 7, Chapter 1, as translated by John Mulryan and Steven Brown (Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006), vol. 2, p. 566.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1600, the citizens of [[Avignon]] bestowed on [[Henry of Navarre]] (the future King [[Henry IV of France]]) the title of the ''Hercule Gaulois'' (\"Gallic Hercules\"), justifying the extravagant flattery with a genealogy that traced the origin of the House of Navarre to a nephew of Hercules' son Hispalus.<ref>The official account, ''Labyrinthe royal...'' quoted in [[Jean Seznec]], ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods'', (B.F. Sessions, tr., 1995) p. 26</ref>\n<br />\n\n== Worship ==\n<u>Road of Hercules</u>\n\nThe Road of Hercules is a route across Southern Gaul that is associated with the path Hercules took during his 10th labor of retrieving the Cattle of Geryon from the Red Isles.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Dewitt|first=Norman|date=February 22, 2020|title=Rome and the 'Road of Hercules'|url=|journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association|volume=72|pages=59\u201369|via=}}</ref>.  Hannibal took the same path on his march towards Italy and encouraged the belief that he was the second Hercules.<ref name=\":0\" /> Primary sources often make comparisons between Hercules and Hannibal<ref name=\":0\" /> Hannibal further tried to invoke parallels between himself and Hercules by starting his march on Italy by visiting the shrine of Hercules at Gades. While crossing the alps, he performed labors in a heroic manner.  A famous example was noted by Livy, when Hannibal fractured the side of a cliff that was blocking his march.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<u>Worship from women</u>\n\nIn ancient Roman society women were usually limited to two types of cults. Those that address feminine matters such as childbirth, and cults that required virginal chastity<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Cecelia|date=February 22, 2020|title=Modern Prejudice and Ancient Praxis: Female Worship of Hercules at Rome|url=|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Papyrologie und Epigraphik|volume=133|pages=291\u201397|via=}}</ref>. However, there is evidence suggesting there were female worshippers of Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Hercules<ref name=\":1\" />. Some scholars believe that women were completely prohibited from any of Hercules's cults. Others believe it was only the \"Ara Maxima\" that they were not allowed to worship at<ref name=\":1\" />. [[Macrobius]] in his first book of ''Saturnalia'' paraphrases from Varro's actinology: ''\"For when Hercules was bringing the cattle of Geryon through Italy, a women replied to the thirsty hero that she could not give him water because it was the day of the Goddess Women and it was unlawful for a man to taste what had been prepared for her. Hercules, therefore, when he was about to offer a sacrifice forbid the presence of women and ordered Potitius and Pinarius who where in charge of his rites, not to allow any women from taking part\"''<ref name=\":1\" />''.'' Macrobius states that women were restricted in their participation in Hercules cults, but to what extent remains ambiguous. He mentions that women were not allowed to participate in Sacrum which is general term used to describe anything that was believed to have belonged to the gods. This could include anything from a precious item to a temple. Due to the general nature of a Sacrum, we can not judge the extent of the prohibition from Macrobius alone<ref name=\":1\" />. There is also ancient writings on this topic from Aulus Gellius when speaking on how Romans swore oaths. He mentioned that Roman women do not swear on Hercules, nor to Roman men swear on Castor<ref name=\":1\" />. He went on to say that women refrain from sacrificing to Hercules<ref name=\":1\" />.  Propertius, whom in his poem 4.9 also mentions similar information as Macrobius. This is evidence that he was also using Varro as a source<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n<u>Worship in myth</u>\n\nThere is evidence of Hercules worship in myth in the Latin epic poem \"The Aeneid\". In the 8th book of the poem Aeneas finally reaches the future site of Rome, where he meets Evander and the Arcadians making sacrifices to Hercules on the banks of the Tiber river.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Loar|first=Matthew|date=February 23, 2020|title=Hercules, Mummius, and the Roman Triumph in Aeneid 8|url=|journal=Classical Philosophy|volume=112|pages=45\u201362|via=}}</ref> They share a feast, and Evander tells the story of how Hercules defeated the monster Cascus, and describes him as a triumphant hero.<ref name=\":2\" /> Translated from the Latin text of Vergil, Evander stated: \"Time brought to us in our time of need the aid and arrival of a god. For there came that mightiest avenger, the victor Hercules, proud with the slaughter and the spoils of threefold Geryon, and he drove the mighty bulls here, and the cattle filled both valley and riverside.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nHercules was also mentioned in the Fables of [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]]. For example, in his fable about [[Philoctetes]] he tells the story of how Philoctetes built a funeral pyre for Hercules so his body could be consumed and raised to immortality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae3.html|title=Hyginus, Fabulae, 100\u201349|last=Grant|first=Mary|date=|website=Theoi Texts Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<u>Hercules and the Roman triumph</u>\n\nAccording to Livy (9.44.16) Romans were commemorating military victories by building statues to Hercules as early as 305 BCE.

In [[classical mythology]], Hercules is famous for his strength and for his numerous far-ranging adventures.\n\nThe Romans adapted the Greek hero's [[iconography]] and myths for their literature and art under the name ''Hercules''. In later [[Western art]] and literature and in [[popular culture]], ''Hercules'' is more commonly used than ''Heracles'' as the name of the hero. Hercules was a multifaceted figure with contradictory characteristics, which enabled later artists and writers to pick and choose how to represent him.<ref>\"Hercules,\" in ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 426.</ref> This article provides an introduction to representations of Hercules in the [[classical tradition|later tradition]].\n\n==Mythology==\n\n===Birth and early life===\nAlthough he was seen as the champion of the weak and a great protector, Hercules' personal problems started at birth. Hera sent two witches to prevent the birth, but they were tricked by one of [[Alcmene]]'s servants and sent to another room. Hera then sent [[Snake| serpents]] to kill him in his cradle, but Hercules strangled them both. In one version of the myth, Alcmene abandoned her baby in the woods in order to protect him from Hera's wrath, but he was found by the goddess Athena who brought him to Hera, claiming he was an orphan child left in the woods who needed nourishment. Hera suckled Hercules at her own breast until the infant bit her nipple, at which point she pushed him away, spilling her milk across the night sky and so forming the [[Milky Way]]. She then gave the infant back to Athena and told her to take care of the baby herself. In feeding the child from her own breast, the goddess inadvertently imbued him with further strength and power.\n\n===The 12 Labours===\n[[File:Antonio del Pollaiolo - Ercole e l'Idra e Ercole e Anteo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Hercules and the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]'' (c. 1475) by [[Antonio del Pollaiuolo]]; the hero wears his characteristic lionskin and wields a club]]\n[[File:Heracles and the Erymantian boar.jpg|thumb|upright|220px|Hercules capturing the [[Erymanthian Boar]], by [[:es:Jos\u00e9 Manuel F\u00e9lix Magdalena|J.M.

A mild oath invoking Hercules (''Hercule!'' or ''Mehercle!'') was a common [[interjection]] in [[Classical Latin]].<ref>W. M. Lindsay, \"Mehercle and Herc(v)lvs. [Mehercle and Herc(u)lus]\" ''The Classical Quarterly'' '''12'''.2 (April 1918:58).</ref>\n\nHercules had a number of [[Roman mythology|myths]] that were distinctly Roman. One of these is Hercules' defeat of [[Cacus]], who was terrorizing the countryside of Rome. The hero was associated with the [[Aventine Hill]] through his son [[Aventinus (mythology)|Aventinus]]. [[Mark Antony]] considered him a personal patron god, as did the emperor [[Commodus]]. Hercules received various forms of [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious veneration]], including as a [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|deity concerned with children and childbirth]], in part because of myths about his precocious infancy, and in part because he fathered countless children. Roman brides wore a special belt tied with the \"[[Hercules knot|knot of Hercules]]\", which was supposed to be hard to untie.<ref>[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 55 (edition of Lindsay); [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 142; Karen K. Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 101, 110, 211.</ref> The comic playwright [[Plautus]] presents the myth of Hercules' conception as a sex comedy in his play ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]''; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] wrote the tragedy ''Hercules Furens'' about his bout with madness. During the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial era]], Hercules was worshipped locally from [[Hispania]] through [[Gaul]].\n\n===Germanic association===\n[[File:Hall of the Augustals.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A fresco from [[Herculaneum]] depicting [[Heracles]] and [[Achelous]] from [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology]], 1st century CE.]]\n\n[[Tacitus]] records a special affinity of the [[Germanic peoples]] for Hercules. In chapter 3 of his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Tacitus states:\n\n{{bquote|... they say that Hercules, too, once visited them; and when going into battle, they sang of him first of all heroes.  They have also those songs of theirs, by the recital of this ''barditus''<ref>or, ''baritus'', there being scribal variants. In the 17th century, the word entered the German language as ''barditus'' and was associated with the Celtic [[bard]]s.</ref> as they call it, they rouse their courage, while from the note they augur the result of the approaching conflict. For, as their line shouts, they inspire or feel alarm.}}\n\nSome have taken this as Tacitus equating the Germanic ''[[Thor|\u00deunraz]]'' with Hercules by way of ''interpretatio romana''.<ref>Simek, Rudolf (2007:140\u2013142) translated by Angela Hall. ''Dictionary of Northern Mythology''.  D.S. Brewer. {{ISBN|0-85991-513-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the Roman era [[Hercules' Club (amulet)|Hercules' Club]] amulets appear from the 2nd to 3rd century, distributed over the empire (including [[Roman Britain]], c.f. Cool 1986), mostly made of gold, shaped like wooden clubs. A specimen found in [[K\u00f6ln-Nippes]] bears the inscription <small>\"DEO HER</small>[culi]\", confirming the association with Hercules.\n\nIn the 5th to 7th centuries, during the [[Migration Period]], the amulet is theorized to have rapidly spread from the [[Elbe Germanic]] area across Europe. These Germanic \"[[Thor|Donar's Clubs]]\" were made from deer antler, bone or wood, more rarely also from bronze or precious metals. The amulet type is replaced by the [[Viking Age]] [[Mj\u00f6lnir|Thor's hammer]] pendants in the course of the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]] from the 8th to 9th century.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Medieval mythography==\n[[File:Histoires de Troyes - Nemeian Lion.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hercules and the [[Nemean lion]] in the 15th-century ''[[Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye|Histoires de Troyes]]'']]\n\nAfter the Roman Empire became [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christianized]], mythological narratives were often reinterpreted as [[allegory]], influenced by the philosophy of [[late antiquity]]. In the 4th century, [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] had described Hercules' return from the underworld as representing his ability to overcome earthly desires and vices, or the earth itself as a consumer of bodies.<ref>[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+6.395&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053 6.395]; Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433\u20131177'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 91.</ref> In medieval mythography, Hercules was one of the heroes seen as a strong role model who demonstrated both valor and wisdom, while the monsters he battles were regarded as moral obstacles.<ref>Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', pp. 168, 218, 413.</ref> One [[glossator]] noted that when [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules became a constellation]], he showed that strength was necessary to gain entrance to Heaven.<ref>Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', p. 219.</ref>\n\nMedieval mythography was written almost entirely in Latin, and original Greek texts were little used as sources for Hercules' myths.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Renaissance mythography==\n[[File:Henry IV en Herculeus terrassant l Hydre de Lerne cad La ligue Catholique Atelier Toussaint Dubreuil circa 1600.jpg|thumb|right|King [[Henry IV of France]] depicted as Hercules vanquishing the [[Lernaean Hydra]] (i.e. the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]), by [[Toussaint Dubreuil]], {{circa|1600}}]]\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] and the invention of the [[printing press]] brought a renewed interest in and publication of Greek literature. Renaissance mythography drew more extensively on the Greek tradition of Heracles, typically under the Romanized name Hercules, or the alternate name [[Heracles|Alcides]]. In a chapter of his book ''Mythologiae'' (1567), the influential mythographer [[Natale Conti]] collected and summarized an extensive range of myths concerning the birth, adventures, and death of the hero under his Roman name Hercules. Conti begins his lengthy chapter on Hercules with an overview description that continues the moralizing impulse of the Middle Ages:\n<blockquote>\nHercules, who subdued and destroyed monsters, bandits, and criminals, was justly famous and renowned for his great courage. His great and glorious reputation was worldwide, and so firmly entrenched that he'll always be remembered. In fact the ancients honored him with his own temples, altars, ceremonies, and priests. But it was his wisdom and great soul that earned those honors; noble blood, physical strength, and political power just aren't good enough.<ref>[[Natale Conti]], ''Mythologiae'' Book 7, Chapter 1, as translated by John Mulryan and Steven Brown (Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006), vol. 2, p. 566.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1600, the citizens of [[Avignon]] bestowed on [[Henry of Navarre]] (the future King [[Henry IV of France]]) the title of the ''Hercule Gaulois'' (\"Gallic Hercules\"), justifying the extravagant flattery with a genealogy that traced the origin of the House of Navarre to a nephew of Hercules' son Hispalus.<ref>The official account, ''Labyrinthe royal...'' quoted in [[Jean Seznec]], ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods'', (B.F. Sessions, tr., 1995) p. 26</ref>\n<br />\n\n== Worship ==\n<u>Road of Hercules</u>\n\nThe Road of Hercules is a route across Southern Gaul that is associated with the path Hercules took during his 10th labor of retrieving the Cattle of Geryon from the Red Isles.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Dewitt|first=Norman|date=February 22, 2020|title=Rome and the 'Road of Hercules'|url=|journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association|volume=72|pages=59\u201369|via=}}</ref>.  Hannibal took the same path on his march towards Italy and encouraged the belief that he was the second Hercules.<ref name=\":0\" /> Primary sources often make comparisons between Hercules and Hannibal<ref name=\":0\" /> Hannibal further tried to invoke parallels between himself and Hercules by starting his march on Italy by visiting the shrine of Hercules at Gades. While crossing the alps, he performed labors in a heroic manner.  A famous example was noted by Livy, when Hannibal fractured the side of a cliff that was blocking his march.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<u>Worship from women</u>\n\nIn ancient Roman society women were usually limited to two types of cults. Those that address feminine matters such as childbirth, and cults that required virginal chastity<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Cecelia|date=February 22, 2020|title=Modern Prejudice and Ancient Praxis: Female Worship of Hercules at Rome|url=|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Papyrologie und Epigraphik|volume=133|pages=291\u201397|via=}}</ref>. However, there is evidence suggesting there were female worshippers of Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Hercules<ref name=\":1\" />. Some scholars believe that women were completely prohibited from any of Hercules's cults. Others believe it was only the \"Ara Maxima\" that they were not allowed to worship at<ref name=\":1\" />. [[Macrobius]] in his first book of ''Saturnalia'' paraphrases from Varro's actinology: ''\"For when Hercules was bringing the cattle of Geryon through Italy, a women replied to the thirsty hero that she could not give him water because it was the day of the Goddess Women and it was unlawful for a man to taste what had been prepared for her. Hercules, therefore, when he was about to offer a sacrifice forbid the presence of women and ordered Potitius and Pinarius who where in charge of his rites, not to allow any women from taking part\"''<ref name=\":1\" />''.'' Macrobius states that women were restricted in their participation in Hercules cults, but to what extent remains ambiguous. He mentions that women were not allowed to participate in Sacrum which is general term used to describe anything that was believed to have belonged to the gods. This could include anything from a precious item to a temple. Due to the general nature of a Sacrum, we can not judge the extent of the prohibition from Macrobius alone<ref name=\":1\" />. There is also ancient writings on this topic from Aulus Gellius when speaking on how Romans swore oaths. He mentioned that Roman women do not swear on Hercules, nor to Roman men swear on Castor<ref name=\":1\" />. He went on to say that women refrain from sacrificing to Hercules<ref name=\":1\" />.  Propertius, whom in his poem 4.9 also mentions similar information as Macrobius. This is evidence that he was also using Varro as a source<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n<u>Worship in myth</u>\n\nThere is evidence of Hercules worship in myth in the Latin epic poem \"The Aeneid\". In the 8th book of the poem Aeneas finally reaches the future site of Rome, where he meets Evander and the Arcadians making sacrifices to Hercules on the banks of the Tiber river.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Loar|first=Matthew|date=February 23, 2020|title=Hercules, Mummius, and the Roman Triumph in Aeneid 8|url=|journal=Classical Philosophy|volume=112|pages=45\u201362|via=}}</ref> They share a feast, and Evander tells the story of how Hercules defeated the monster Cascus, and describes him as a triumphant hero.<ref name=\":2\" /> Translated from the Latin text of Vergil, Evander stated: \"Time brought to us in our time of need the aid and arrival of a god. For there came that mightiest avenger, the victor Hercules, proud with the slaughter and the spoils of threefold Geryon, and he drove the mighty bulls here, and the cattle filled both valley and riverside.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nHercules was also mentioned in the Fables of [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]]. For example, in his fable about [[Philoctetes]] he tells the story of how Philoctetes built a funeral pyre for Hercules so his body could be consumed and raised to immortality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae3.html|title=Hyginus, Fabulae, 100\u201349|last=Grant|first=Mary|date=|website=Theoi Texts Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<u>Hercules and the Roman triumph</u>\n\nAccording to Livy (9.44.16) Romans were commemorating military victories by building statues to Hercules as early as 305 BCE. Also, philosopher Piny the Elder dates Hercules worship back to the time of Evander, by accrediting him with erecting a statue in the Forum Boarium of Hercules.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|last=Loar|first=Matthew|date=February 23, 2020|title=Hercules, Mummius, and the Roman Triumph in Aeneid 8|url=|journal=Classical Philosophy|volume=112|pages=45\u201362|via=}}</ref> Scholars agree that there would have been 5\u20137 temples in Augustan Rome<ref name=\":22\" />. There are believed to be related Republican ''triumphatores,'' however, not necessarily triumphal dedications. There is two temples located in the Campus Martius. One, being the Temple of Hercules Musarum, dedicated between 187 and 179 BCE by M. Fulvius Nobilior.<ref name=\":22\" /> And the other being the Temple of Hercules Custos, likely renovated by Sulla in the 80s BCE<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n===In art===\nIn Roman works of art and in Renaissance and post-Renaissance art, Hercules can be identified by his attributes, the [[Nemean Lion|lion skin]] and the gnarled [[Club (weapon)|club]] (his favorite weapon); in [[mosaic]] he is shown tanned bronze, a virile aspect.<ref>''Hercules'' almost suggests \"Hero\". The Classical and Hellenistic convention in frescoes and mosaics, adopted by the Romans, is to show women as pale-skinned and men as tanned dark from their outdoor arena of action and exercising in the [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]].(See also [http://academic.reed.edu/humanities/110Tech/RomanAfrica2/pompei%26herc1.jpg Reed.edu], jpg file.

By the rivers of the Volga basin and its tributary Vazuza Gzhat and tributary of the [[Oka river]], [[Ugra River (Oka)|Ugra]]. To the north-west flows a short section of the [[Western Dvina River]] and its tributary river Kasplya .\n\nAmong the major reservoirs supplying water are Moscow Vazuzssky Yauza and reservoirs in the north-east, as well as cooling power plants, Smolensk reservoir in the north near the village of Lake and Desnogorsk Reservoir in the south area of the city near the Desnogorsk .\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of Smolensk Oblast is humid continental, similar to the climate of [[Moscow Oblast]], but slightly warmer in winter due to being located further west. Summers are short, warm and rainy, while winters are long, cold and snowy. Average temperatures range from {{convert|-9|C}} in January to {{convert|17|C}} in July (although in the south it ranges from {{convert|-8|C}} in January to {{convert|18|C}} in July).

Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].\n\nThe Charter of Smolensk Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Smolensk is the province's standing legislative (representative) body.

The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{Main|Administrative divisions of Smolensk Oblast}}\n[[File:Smolensk admin divisions.png|thumb|Administrative divisions of Smolensk Oblast]]\n\nSmolensk Oblast is divided into 25 districts (''[[raion]]s'') and 2 [[city of federal subject significance|cities]], which are further divided into 15 [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|towns]], 12 [[urban-type settlement]]s, and 302 [[selsoviet|rural okrugs]].\n\n==Demographics==\n'''Population''': {{ru-census|p2010=985,537|p2002=1,049,574|p1989=1,158,299}}\n\n;2012\n*Births: 10 289 (10.5 per 1000)\n*Deaths: 16 318 (16.7 per 1000) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/2012/demo/edn12-12.htm|title=\u0415\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438|website=www.gks.ru}}</ref>\n*'''Total fertility rate:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_main/rosstat/ru/statistics/publications/catalog/doc_1137674209312|title=\u041a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433 \u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439::\u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430  \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438|website=www.gks.ru}}</ref>'''\n2009 - 1.40 | 2010 - 1.38 | 2011 - 1.40 | 2012 - 1.43 | 2013 - 1.48 | 2014 - 1.53 | 2015 - 1.52 | 2016 - 1.52(e)\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, the ethnic composition of the oblast was as follows:<ref name=\"2010Census\" />\n*[[Russians]]: 94.6%\n*[[Ukrainians]]: 1.3%\n*[[Belarusians]]: 1.3%\n*[[Armenians]]: 0.5%\n*Others: 2.3%\n*41,457 people were registered from administrative databases, and could not declare an ethnicity.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. A [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]], its heavy dependence on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equations|prey-predator cycle]]. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=[[The Animal Kingdom]] |date=1792 |publisher=A.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. A [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]], its heavy dependence on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equations|prey-predator cycle]]. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=[[The Animal Kingdom]] |date=1792 |publisher=A.
