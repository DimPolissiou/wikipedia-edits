It uses a driver-operated [[clutch]], usually engaged and disengaged by a foot pedal or hand lever, for regulating [[torque]] transfer from the [[internal combustion engine|engine]] to the transmission; and a [[gear selector]] that can be operated by hand.\n\nA conventional 5- or 6-speed manual transmission is often the standard equipment in a modern base model vehicle, with 5- speed being common on lower end vehicles and commercial vehicles.  Higher end vehicles, such as [[sports car]]s and [[luxury car]]s are often usually equipped with a 6-speed transmission for the base model. Other options include automatic transmissions such as a [[automatic transmission|traditional automatic (hydraulic planetary) transmission]] (often a [[manumatic]]), an [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| automated manual transmission]], or a [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT). The number of forward gear ratios is often expressed for automatic transmissions as well (e.g., 9-speed automatic).\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:0762 Spinning Levers 04 45 20 00 3mb.webm|thumb|1936 film of automobile gearbox]]\nManual transmissions often feature a [[driving|driver]]-operated [[clutch]] and a movable [[gear stick]]. Most automobile manual transmissions allow the driver to select any forward [[gear ratio]] (\"gear\") at any time, but some, such as those commonly mounted on [[motorcycle]]s and some types of racing cars, only allow the driver to select the next-higher or next-lower gear. This type of transmission is sometimes called a [[sequential manual transmission]].\n\nIn a manual transmission, the [[flywheel]] is attached to the engine's [[crankshaft]] and spins along with it. The [[clutch]] disc is in between the [[pressure plate]] and the flywheel, and is held against the flywheel under pressure from the pressure plate. When the engine is running and the clutch is engaged (i.e., clutch pedal up), the flywheel spins the clutch plate and hence the transmission. As the clutch pedal is depressed, the [[Thrust bearing|throw out bearing]] is activated, which causes the pressure plate to stop applying pressure to the clutch disk. This makes the clutch plate stop receiving power from the engine so that the gear can be shifted without damaging the transmission. When the clutch pedal is released, the throw out bearing is deactivated, and the clutch disk is again held against the flywheel, allowing it to start receiving power from the engine.\n\nWith manual transmissions, gear ratios can be selected by locking selected gear pairs to the output shaft inside the transmission. Conversely, most [[automatic transmission]]s feature [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic]] ([[epicyclic gearing|planetary]]) gearing controlled by brake bands and/or clutch packs to select gear ratio. [[Automatic transmission]]s that allow the driver to manually select the current gear are called [[manumatic]]s. A manual-style transmission operated by computer is often called an ''automated'' transmission rather than an ''automatic'', even though no distinction between the two terms need be made.\n\nContemporary automobile manual transmissions typically use four to six forward gear ratios and one reverse gear, although consumer automobile manual transmissions have been built with as few as two and as many as seven gears. Transmissions for heavy trucks and other heavy equipment usually have 8 to 25 gears, so that there are both a wide range of gears and close gear ratios to keep the engine running in the [[power band]]. Operating such transmissions often uses the same pattern of shifter movement with a single or multiple switches to engage the next sequence of gears.\n\n==Unsynchronized transmission {{anchor|Constant-mesh gearbox}} ==\n{{main article|Non-synchronous transmission}}\n[[File:PSM V57 D608 Cherrier two speed gear.png|thumb|right|Cherrier two speed gear, circa 1900<ref>[[Wikisource:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 57/August 1900/The Evolution and Present Status of the Automobile]]</ref>\n]]\nFrench inventors Louis-Rene Panhard and Emile Levassor are credited with the development of the  first modern manual transmission. They demonstrated their three-speed transmission in 1894 and the basic design is still the starting point for most contemporary manual transmissions. This type of transmission offered multiple gear ratios and, in most cases, reverse. The gears were typically engaged by sliding them on their shafts (hence the phrase ''shifting gears''), which required careful timing and [[throttle]] manipulation when shifting, so the gears would be spinning at roughly the same speed when engaged; otherwise, the teeth would refuse to mesh. These transmissions are called ''sliding mesh'' transmissions or sometimes [[Non-synchronous transmission|crash boxes]], because of the difficulty in changing gears and the loud grinding sound that often accompanied. Newer manual transmissions on 4+-wheeled vehicles have all gears mesh at all times and are referred to as ''constant-mesh'' transmissions, with \"synchro-mesh\" being a further refinement of the constant mesh principle.\n\nIn both types, a particular gear combination can only be engaged when the two parts to engage (either gears or clutches) are at the same speed. To shift to a higher gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the engine allowed to slow down until the transmission parts for the next gear are at a proper speed to engage. The vehicle also slows while in neutral and that slows other transmission parts, so the time in neutral depends on the grade, wind, and other such factors. To shift to a lower gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the throttle is used to speed up the engine and thus the relevant transmission parts, to match speeds for engaging the next lower gear. For both upshifts and downshifts, the clutch is released (engaged) while in neutral. Some drivers use the clutch only for starting from a stop, and shifts are done without the clutch. Other drivers will depress (disengage) the clutch, shift to neutral, then engage the clutch momentarily to force transmission parts to match the engine speed, then depress the clutch again to shift to the next gear, a process called [[Double clutch (technique)|double clutching]]. Double clutching is easier to get smooth, as speeds that are close but not quite matched need to speed up or slow down only transmission parts, whereas with the clutch engaged to the engine, mismatched speeds are fighting the rotational inertia and power of the engine.\n\nEven though automobile and light truck transmissions are now almost universally synchronized, transmissions for heavy [[truck]]s and machinery, motorcycles, and for dedicated [[automobile racing|racing]] are usually not. [[Non-synchronous transmission|Non-synchronized transmission]] designs are used for several reasons. The friction material, such as [[brass]], in synchronizers is more prone to wear and breakage than gears, which are forged steel, and the simplicity of the mechanism improves reliability and reduces cost. In addition, the process of shifting a non-synchromesh transmission is faster than that of shifting a synchromesh transmission. For racing of production-based transmissions, sometimes half the teeth on the dog clutches are removed to speed the shifting process, at the expense of greater wear.\n\nHeavy duty trucks often use unsynchronized transmissions, though military trucks usually have synchronized transmissions, allowing untrained personnel to operate them in emergencies. In the United States, traffic safety rules refer to [[non-synchronous transmission]]s in classes of larger [[commercial motor vehicle]]s. In Europe, heavy duty trucks use synchronized gearboxes as standard.\n\nSimilarly, most modern motorcycles use unsynchronized transmissions: their low gear inertias and higher strengths mean that forcing the gears to alter speed is not damaging, and the pedal operated selector on modern motorcycles, with no neutral position between gears (except, commonly, 1st and 2nd), is not conducive to having the long [[shift time]] of a synchronized gearbox. On bikes with a 1-N-2(-3-4...) transmission, it is necessary either to stop, slow down, or synchronize gear speeds by blipping the throttle when shifting from 2nd into 1st.\n\n==Synchronized transmission==\n[[File:Ford Design 3-speed OD Transmission w. Hurst Shifter.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Top and side view of a typical manual transmission, in this case a Ford [[Ford Toploader transmission|Toploader]], used in vehicles with external floor shifters.]]\n\nMost modern manual-transmission vehicles are fitted with a synchronized gear box. Transmission gears are always in mesh and rotating, but gears on one shaft can freely rotate or be locked to the shaft. The locking mechanism for a gear consists of a collar (or ''[[dog clutch|dog collar]]'') on the shaft which is able to slide sideways so that teeth (or ''dogs'') on its inner surface bridge two circular rings with teeth on their outer circumference: one attached to the gear, one to the shaft hub. When the rings are bridged by the collar, that particular gear is rotationally locked to the shaft and determines the output speed of the transmission. The gearshift lever manipulates the collars using a set of [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkages]], so arranged so that one collar may be permitted to lock only one gear at any one time; when \"shifting gears\", the locking collar from one gear is disengaged before that of another is engaged. One collar often serves for two gears; sliding in one direction selects one transmission speed, in the other direction selects another.\n\nIn a synchromesh gearbox, to correctly match the speed of the gear to that of the shaft as the gear is engaged the collar initially applies a force to a cone-shaped brass clutch attached to the gear, which brings the speeds to match prior to the collar locking into place. The collar is prevented from bridging the locking rings when the speeds are mismatched by synchro rings (also called blocker rings or baulk rings). The synchro ring rotates slightly due to the frictional torque from the cone clutch. In this position, the dog clutch is prevented from engaging. The brass clutch ring gradually causes parts to spin at the same speed. When they do spin the same speed, there is no more torque from the cone clutch and the dog clutch is allowed to fall into engagement. In a modern gearbox, the action of all of these components is so smooth and fast it is hardly noticed.\n\nThe modern cone system was developed by [[Porsche]] and introduced in the 1952 [[Porsche 356]]; cone synchronisers were called ''Porsche-type'' for many years after this. In the early 1950s, only the second-third shift was synchromesh in most vehicles, requiring only a single synchro and a simple linkage; drivers' manuals in vehicles suggested that if the driver needed to shift from second to first, it was best to come to a complete stop then shift into first and start up again. With continuing sophistication of mechanical development, fully synchromesh transmissions with three speeds, then four, and then five, became universal by the 1980s. Many modern manual-transmission vehicles, especially sports cars, now offer six speeds. The 2012 Porsche 911 offers a seven-speed manual transmission, with the seventh gear intended for cruising\u2014the top speed being attained on sixth.\n\nReverse gear is usually not synchromesh, as there is only one reverse gear in the normal automotive transmission and changing gears into reverse while moving is not required\u2014and often highly undesirable, particularly at high forward speed. Additionally, the usual method of providing reverse, with an idler gear sliding into place to bridge what would otherwise be two mismatched forward gears, is necessarily similar to the operation of a crash box. Among the vehicles that have synchromesh in reverse are the 1995\u20132000 Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique, '00\u2013'05 Chevrolet Cavalier, Mercedes 190 2.3-16, the V6 equipped [[Alfa Romeo GTV & Spider|Alfa Romeo GTV/Spider (916)]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alfisti.net/311.2.html?&L=1 |title=Buyers Guide Alfa Romeo Spider & GTV 916 |publisher=Alfisti.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> certain Chrysler, Jeep, and GM products which use the New Venture NV3500 and NV3550 units, the European Ford Sierra and Granada/Scorpio equipped with the [[Ford MT75 transmission|MT75]] gearbox, the Volvo 850, and almost all [[Lamborghini]]s, [[Honda]]s and [[BMW]]s.\n\n==Internals==\n[[File:ZF-16S181-transmission-hous.jpg|thumb|16-speed (2x4x2) [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] 16S181 \u2014 opened transmission housing ('''''2x4x'''''2)]]\n[[File:ZF-16S181-range.jpg|thumb|16S181 \u2014 opened [[Epicyclic gearing|planetary]] range housing (2x4'''''x2''''')]]\n===Shafts===\nA manual transmission has several shafts with various gears and other components attached to them.

For reverse gear, an idler gear is used to reverse the direction in which the output shaft rotates. In many transmissions, the input and output shafts can be directly locked together (bypassing the counter shaft) to create a 1:1 gear ratio which is referred to as ''direct drive''.\n\nIn a transmission for [[longitudinal engine]]d vehicles (e.g. most rear-wheel drive cars), it is common for the input shaft and output shaft to be located on the same axis, since this reduces the [[torsion (mechanics)|torsional forces]] to which the transmission casing must withstand. The assembly consisting of both the input and output shafts is referred to as the ''mainshaft'' (although sometimes this term refers to just the input shaft or output shaft). Independent rotation of the input and output shafts is made possibly by one shaft being located inside the hollow bore of the other shaft, with a bearing located between the two shafts.\n\nIn a transmission for [[transverse engine]]d vehicles (e.g. front-wheel drive cars), there are usually only two shafts: input and countershaft (sometimes called input and output). The input shaft runs the whole length of the gearbox, and there is no separate input pinion. These transmissions also have an integral [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] unit, which is connected via a pinion gear at the end of the counter/output shaft.\n\n===Dog clutch===\n[[File:Selettore.jpg|thumb|Dog clutches. The gear-like teeth (\"dogs\", right-side images) engage and disengage with each other.]]\n\nAmong many different types of clutches, a dog clutch provides non-slip coupling of two rotating members. It is not suited to intentional slipping, in contrast with the foot-operated friction clutch of a manual-transmission vehicle.\n\nThe gear selector does not engage or disengage the actual gear teeth which are permanently meshed. Rather, the action of the gear selector is to lock one of the freely spinning gears to the shaft that runs through its hub. The shaft then spins together with that gear. The output shaft's speed relative to the countershaft is determined by the ratio of the two gears: the one permanently attached to the countershaft, and that gear's mate which is now locked to the output shaft.\n\nLocking the output shaft with a gear is achieved by means of a [[dog clutch]] selector. The dog clutch is a sliding selector mechanism which is splined to the output shaft, meaning that its hub has teeth that fit into slots (splines) on the shaft, forcing that shaft to rotate with it. However, the splines allow the selector to move back and forth on the shaft, which happens when it is pushed by a selector fork that is linked to the gear lever. The fork does not rotate, so it is attached to a collar bearing on the selector. The selector is typically symmetric: it slides between two gears and has a synchromesh and teeth on each side in order to lock either gear to the shaft.\n\n===Synchromesh===\n[[File:Sincronizzatore.jpg|thumb|Synchronizer rings]]\nSynchromesh transmission was invented in 1919 by [[Earl Avery Thompson]] and introduced by Cadillac in 1928.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hooniverse.com/synchromesh-gear-box-hows-that-work/|title=Synchromesh Gear Box- How's That Work?|author=|date=29 April 2014|work=hooniverse.com|accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref> If the dog teeth make contact with the gear, but the two parts are spinning at different speeds, the teeth will fail to engage and a loud grinding sound will be heard as they clatter together. For this reason, a modern dog clutch in an automobile has a synchronizer mechanism or ''synchromesh'', which consists of a [[cone clutch]] and blocking ring. Before the teeth can engage, the cone clutch engages first, which brings the selector and gear to the same speed using friction. Until synchronization occurs, the teeth are prevented from making contact, because further motion of the selector is prevented by a ''blocker'' (or ''baulk'') ring. When synchronization occurs, friction on the blocker ring is relieved and it twists slightly, bringing into alignment certain grooves or notches that allow further passage of the selector which brings the teeth together. The exact design of the synchronizer varies among manufacturers.\n\nThe synchronizer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/transmission3.htm|title=Synchronizers; graphic illustration of how they work|website=Howstuffworks.com|accessdate=2007-07-18|date=April 2000}}</ref> has to overcome the momentum of the entire input shaft and clutch disk when it is changing shaft rpm to match the new gear ratio. It can be abused by exposure to the momentum and power of the engine, which is what happens when attempts are made to select a gear without fully disengaging the clutch. This causes extra wear on the rings and sleeves, reducing their service life. When an experimenting driver tries to \"match the revs\" on a synchronized transmission and force it into gear without using the clutch, the synchronizer will make up for any discrepancy in RPM. The success in engaging the gear without clutching can deceive the driver into thinking that the RPM of the layshaft and transmission were actually exactly matched. Nevertheless, approximate rev. matching ''with [[double clutching]]'' can decrease the difference in rotational speed between the layshaft and transmission gear shaft, therefore decreasing synchro wear.\n\nSynchronizing rings are made of [[metal]] and can be provided with anti-wear coatings called a friction lining.\nCommon metals for synchronizer rings are [[brass]] and [[steel]]. The linings typically consist of [[molybdenum]], [[iron]], [[bronze]] or [[carbon]].\nThe synchronizing rings are produced either by massive forming ([[Forging|common forging]]) or sheet metal shaping. The latter involves the [[Metal stamping|stamping]] of the blank out of a [[Sheet metal|sheet metal strip]] and the subsequent machining with follow-on composite tools or transfer tools. A friction lining usually consists of thermally splashed molybdenum. Alternatively, [[iron]] or [[bronze]] [[Sintering|sinter]] friction layers can be used. [[Carbon]]-[[Coating|coated]] synchronizer rings are particularly [[wear]] resistant and offer very good friction behavior. Due to their higher price, these are reserved for high-performance transmissions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Diehl Metall Stiftung &amp; Co. KG |url=http://www.diehl.com/en/diehl-metall/products/synchronizer-rings.html |title=Synchronizer Rings: Diehl Metall |website=Diehl.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-06}}</ref>\n\nTransmissions with brass synchronizer components are generally not suitable for use with [[Gear oil|GL-5 specification oil]] unless specifically stated by the manufacturer as the extreme pressure (EP) additives in the oil are corrosive to brass and bronze components at high temperatures and decrease the synchronizer effectiveness at low temperatures. The additives in GL-5 oil also cause physical damage to brass synchronizers as the EP additives bond more strongly to the brass than the brass does to itself, causing a small layer of brass to be worn off with every gear change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widman.biz/uploads/Transaxle_oil.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Difference between GL-4 and GL-5 Gear Oils |author=Richard Widman |website=Widman.biz |accessdate=2017-03-06}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130413104023/http://www.caltex.com.au/FPL%20PDS/Thuban%20GL5%20EP.pdf]</ref> Instead, oil which meets only the GL-4 specification should be used whenever possible.\n\n===Reverse===\nThe previous discussion normally applies only to the forward gears. The implementation of the reverse gear is usually different, implemented in the following way to reduce the cost of the transmission. Reverse is also a pair of gears: one gear on the countershaft and one on the output shaft. However, whereas all the forward gears are always meshed together, there is a gap between the reverse gears. Moreover, they are both attached to their shafts: neither one rotates freely about the shaft. When reverse is selected a small gear, called an ''[[idler gear]]'' or ''reverse idler'', is slid between them. The idler has teeth which mesh with both gears, and thus it couples these gears together and reverses the direction of rotation without changing the gear ratio.\n\nIn other words, when reverse gear is selected, it is in fact ''actual'' gear teeth that are being meshed, with no aid from a synchronization mechanism. For this reason, the output shaft must not be rotating when reverse is selected: the vehicle must be stopped. In order that reverse can be selected without grinding even if the input shaft is spinning inertially, there may be a mechanism to stop the input shaft from spinning. The driver brings the vehicle to a stop, and selects reverse. As that selection is made, some mechanism in the transmission stops the input shaft. Both gears are stopped and the idler can be inserted between them. There is a clear description of such a mechanism in the [[Honda Civic]] 1996\u20131998 Service Manual, which refers to it as a \"noise reduction system\":\n\n{{quote|Whenever the [[automobile pedal|clutch pedal]] is depressed to shift into reverse, the mainshaft continues to rotate because of its inertia. The resulting speed difference between mainshaft and reverse idler gear produces gear noise [grinding]. The reverse gear noise reduction system employs a cam plate which was added to the reverse shift holder. When shifting into reverse, the 5th/reverse shift piece, connected to the shift lever, rotates the cam plate. This causes the 5th synchro set to stop the rotating mainshaft.|(13-4)}}\n\nA reverse gear implemented this way makes a loud whining sound, which is not normally heard in the forward gears. The teeth on the forward gears of most consumer automobiles are helically cut. When [[helical gear]]s rotate, there is constant contact between gears, which results in quiet operation. In spite of all forward gears being always meshed, they do not make a sound that can be easily heard above the engine noise. By contrast, most reverse gears are [[Spur gears|spur gear]]s, meaning that they have straight teeth, in order to allow for the sliding engagement of the idler, which is difficult with helical gears. The teeth of spur gears clatter together when the gears spin, generating a characteristic whine.\n\nAttempting to select reverse while the vehicle is moving forward causes severe gear wear (except in transmissions with synchromesh on the reverse gear). However, most manual transmissions have a gate that locks out reverse directly from 5th gear to help prevent this. In order to engage reverse from 5th, the shift lever has to be moved to the center position between 3rd and 4th, then back over and into reverse. Another widespread solution places reverse to the left of 1st gear, instead of behind the 5th (where one might expect to find a 6th gear). Many newer six-speed manual transmissions have a collar under the shift knob which must be lifted to engage reverse. Other reverse lockout designs include having to push the shift lever inward, toward the floor, to allow engagement of reverse, or requiring the driver to exert additional force to move the shift lever into reverse.\n\nThe spur gear design of reverse gear represents some compromises (less robust, unsynchronized engagement and loud noise) which are acceptable due to the relatively small amount of driving that takes place in reverse. The gearbox of the classic [[Saab 900|SAAB 900]] is a notable example of a gearbox with a helical reverse gear engaged in the same unsynchronized manner as the spur gears described above. Its design allows reverse to share cogs with first gear, and is exceptionally quiet, but results in difficult engagement and unreliable operation. However, many modern transmissions now include a reverse gear synchronizer and helical gearing, especially in applications which use three shafts as part of the transmission implementation instead of the conventional dual input and output shafts (usually to permit a shorter gearbox for the number of gears provided), since the third shaft inherently provides the option to reverse output rotation while still allowing permanently meshing gears.\n\n===Design variations===\n\n====Ratio count====\nUntil the mid-1950s (earlier in Europe and later in the US, on average) vehicles were generally equipped with 3-speed transmissions as standard equipment. 4-speed units began to appear on volume-production models in the 1930s (Europe) and 1950s (USA) and gained popularity in the 1960s; some exotics had 5-speeds. In the 1970s, as fuel prices rose and fuel economy became an important selling feature, 4-speed transmissions with an overdrive 4th gear or 5-speeds were offered in mass market automobiles and even compact pickup trucks, pioneered by [[Toyota]] (who advertised the fact by giving each model the suffix ''SR5'' as it acquired the fifth speed). 6-speed transmissions started to emerge in high-performance vehicles in the early 1990s. 7-speed transmissions appeared on extreme high-end supercars, such as the 2005 [[Bugatti Veyron]] (semi-automatic manual transmission). In 2012, the [[Porsche 911]] featured a 7-speed manual transmission, becoming the first of its class to support this feature, paving the way for the 2014 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C7)|Chevrolet Corvette Stingray]].\n\nToday, mass-market automotive manual transmissions are nearly all at least 5-speed. 4-speed manual transmissions had fallen into almost total disuse by the end of the 1980s, having gradually become less common on vehicles during the 1980s. By the early 1990s in the USA, they are usually only found on vehicles with engines of around 1\u20132 litres.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nIt has been widely anticipated that for electric vehicles (EVs), clutches and multi-speed gearboxes would not be required, as electric motors can drive the vehicle both forward and reverse from zero speed and typically operate over a wider speed range than combustion engines. Elimination of the gearbox represents a significant reduction in powertrain weight and complexity, and also removes a notable source of parasitic losses. The majority of first-generation consumer EVs have therefore been single-speed. However, current trends indicate that multi-speed gearboxes are likely to return for many future EVs. This allows the use of smaller, lower torque motors running at higher speeds to achieve both greater torque at the wheels for low speed tractive effort, and higher top road speed. Modest efficiency gains are also possible by reducing the proportion of the time that the motor(s) operate at very low speeds where efficiency is reduced. The wider speed range of motors means that the number of ratios required is lower than for combustion engine vehicles, with two to four speed designs emerging as the optimum depending on application.\n\nInitially the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]] was intended to have a purpose-built two-speed manual transmission,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/3528.html |title=2007 Tesla roadster |publisher=Supercars.net |date=2006-07-19 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref> but this gearbox proved to be problematic and was later replaced with a fixed-ratio transmission.\n\n====Gear ratios====\nThe slowest gears (designated '1' or low gear) in most automotive applications allow for three to four engine rotations for each output revolution (3:1). High, or \"top\", gear in many earlier three or four speed manual transmissions locks the output shaft to spin at the same speed as the engine (1:1). Five and six speed gearboxes are almost always 'overdrive' in top gear with the engine turning less than a full turn for each revolution of the output shaft, 0.8:1 for example (however, the final drive, or differential, always has further reduction gearing).\n\n====External overdrive====\n{{Main article|overdrive (mechanics)|l1=Overdrive}}\nIn the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, fuel-efficient highway cruising with low engine speed was in some cases enabled on vehicles equipped with 3- or 4-speed transmissions by means of a separate [[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] unit in or behind the rear housing of the transmission. This was actuated either manually while in high gear by throwing a switch or pressing a button on the gearstick knob or on the steering column, or automatically by momentarily lifting the foot from the accelerator with the vehicle travelling above a certain road speed. Automatic overdrives were disengaged by flooring the accelerator, and a lockout control was provided to enable the driver to disable overdrive and operate the transmission as a normal (non-overdrive) transmission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordification.com/tech/overdrive.htm |title=The Borg-Warner Overdrive Transmission Explained |publisher=FORDification.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-22}}</ref>\n\n====Shaft and gear configuration====\nOn a conventional rear-drive transmission, there are three basic shafts; the input, the output, and the countershaft. The input and output together are called the ''mainshaft'', since they are joined inside the transmission so they appear to be a single shaft, although they rotate totally independently of each other. The input shaft is much shorter than the output shaft. Parallel to the mainshaft is the countershaft. There are a number of gears fixed along the countershaft, and matching gears along the output shaft, although these are not fixed, and rotate independently of the output shaft. There are sliding ''dog collars'', or ''dog clutches'', between the gears on the output shaft, and to engage a gear to the shaft, the collar slides into the space between the shaft and the inside space of the gear, thus rotating the shaft as well. One collar is usually mounted between two gears, and slides both ways to engage one or the other gears, so on a four-speed there would be two collars. A front-drive transmission is basically the same, but may be simplified. There often are two shafts, the input and the output, but depending on the direction of rotation of the engine, three may be required. Rather than the input shaft driving the countershaft with a pinion gear, the input shaft takes over the countershaft's job, and the output shaft runs parallel to it. The gears are positioned and engaged just as they are on the countershaft and output shaft of a rear-drive. This merely eliminates one major component, the pinion gear. Part of the reason that the input and output are in-line on a rear drive unit is to relieve torsional stress on the transmission and mountings, but this is not an issue in a front-drive as the gearbox is integrated into the transaxle.\n\nThe basic process is not universal. The fixed and free gears can be mounted on either the input or output shaft, or both.\n\nThe distribution of the shifters is also a matter of design; it need not be the case that all of the free-rotating gears with selectors are on one shaft, and the permanently splined gears on the other. For instance a five-speed transmission might have the first-to-second selectors on the countershaft, but the third-to-fourth selector and the fifth selector on the mainshaft, which is the configuration in the 1998 [[Honda Civic]]. This means that when the vehicle is stopped and idling in neutral with the clutch engaged and the input shaft spinning, the third-, fourth-, and fifth-gear pairs do not rotate.\n\nIn some transmission designs (Volvo 850 and V/S70 series, for example) there are actually two countershafts, both driving an output pinion meshing with the front-wheel-drive transaxle's ring gear. This allows the transmission designer to make the transmission narrower, since each countershaft need only be half as long as a traditional countershaft with four gears and two shifters.\n\nOn some exotic sports cars and racing cars equipped with a double-clutch transmission, there are typically two input shafts and two countershafts, one for the odd numbered gears and one for the even numbered gears. This allows the next gear to be pre-engaged and selected by de-clutching one input shaft clutching the other. This results in no interruption of power driven through to the output shaft.\n\n====Freewheeling====\nSome automotive manual transmissions had [[freewheel]]ing capability in the 1930s through 1960s.\n\n==Clutch==\n{{Main article|Clutch#Vehicular|l1=Clutch}}\nIn all vehicles using a transmission (virtually all modern vehicles), a coupling device is used to separate the engine and transmission when necessary. This is because most internal-combustion engines must continue to run when in use, although a few modern vehicles shut off the engine [[start-stop system|when the vehicle is stationary]]. The [[clutch]] accomplishes this in manual transmissions. Without it, then other than when the transmission is in neutral, the engine and wheels would at all times be inextricably linked, and any time the vehicle stopped, the engine would stall. Without the clutch, changing gears would be very difficult, even with the vehicle moving already: deselecting a gear while the transmission is under load requires considerable force (and risks significant damage), but can still be done with much less force if the driver releases the accelerator just prior to attempting a shift as if there were no clutch disengaged. Selecting a gear requires the revolution speed of the engine to be held at a very precise value which depends on the vehicle speed and desired gear\u2013the speeds inside the transmission have to match. In a 4+-wheeled vehicle, the clutch is usually operated by a [[automobile pedal|pedal]]; on a motorcycle, a lever on the left handlebar serves the purpose.\n\n* When the clutch pedal is fully depressed, the clutch is fully disengaged, and no [[torque]] is transferred from the engine to the transmission (and by extension to the drive wheels). In this uncoupled state it is possible to select gears or to stop the vehicle without stopping the engine.\n* When the clutch pedal is fully released, the clutch is fully engaged and all of the engine's torque is transferred. In this coupled state, the clutch does not slip, but rather acts as rigid coupling to transmit power to the gearbox.\n* Between these extremes of engagement and disengagement the clutch slips to varying degrees. When slipping it still transmits torque despite the difference in speeds between the engine crankshaft and the transmission input. Because this torque is transmitted by means of friction rather than direct mechanical contact, considerable power is wasted as heat (which is dissipated by the clutch). Properly applied, slip allows the vehicle to be started from a standstill, and when it is already moving, allows the engine rotation to gradually adjust to a newly selected gear ratio.\n* Learning to use the clutch efficiently requires the development of [[muscle memory]] and a level of coordination.\n\nThe clutch is typically disengaged by a [[thrust bearing]] that makes contact with pressure petals on the clutch ring plate and pushes them inward to release the clutch pad friction. Normally the bearing remains retracted away from the petals and does not spin. However, the bearing can be \"burned out\" and damaged by using the clutch pedal as a foot rest, which causes the bearing to spin continuously from touching the clutch plates.\n\n=== Float shifting ===\n{{main article|Float shifting}}\nFloat shifting or floating gears is changing gears without depressing the clutch, usually on a non-synchronized transmission. Since the clutch is not used, it is easy to mismatch speeds of gears, and the driver can quickly cause major (and expensive) damage to the gears and the transmission. Float shifting is often done on large trucks with standard (non-synchronized) gearboxes.\n\n==Gear shift types==\n\n===Floor-mounted shifter===\n{{Main article|Gear stick}}\nIn most vehicles with manual transmission, gears are selected by manipulating a lever called a '''gear stick''', '''shift stick''', '''gearshift''', '''gear lever''', '''gear selector''', or '''shifter''' connected to the transmission via linkage or [[Bowden cable|cables]] and mounted on the floor, dashboard, or steering column. Moving the lever forward, backward, left, and right into specific positions selects particular gears.\n\nA sample layout of a four-speed transmission is shown below. '''N''' marks ''neutral'', the position wherein no gears are engaged and the engine is decoupled from the vehicle's drive wheels. The entire horizontal line is a neutral position, though the shifter is usually [[Spring (device)|spring-loaded]] so it will return to the centre of the N position if not moved to another gear. The '''R''' marks reverse, the gear position used for moving the vehicle backward.\n\n[[File:Manual Layout4d.svg|125px]]\n\nThis layout is called the '''shift pattern'''. Because of the shift quadrants, the basic arrangement is often called an ''H-pattern''. The shift pattern is usually molded or printed on or near the [[gear knob]].\n\nTypically, first gear is engaged at the top left position with second below, third up to the right with fourth, below, and so on. The only other pattern used in production vehicle manual transmissions is known as a [[dog-leg gearbox]] pattern. This pattern locates first at bottom left position, second up and to the right with third below, fourth up and to the right, and so on. This pattern is found primarily in race and race inspired vehicles. Placing the selection position for second gear above the position for third gear is desirable in racing as more frequent shifting occurs from second to third than from first to second.\n\nIndependent of the shift pattern, the location of the reverse gear may vary. Depending on the particular transmission design, reverse may be located at the upper left extent of the shift pattern, at the lower left, at the lower right, or at the upper right. There is often a mechanism that allows selection of reverse only from the neutral position, or a reverse lockout that must be released by depressing the spring-loaded gear knob or lifting a spring-loaded collar on the shift stick, to reduce the likelihood of the driver inadvertently selecting reverse.\n\n==== \"Three on the tree\" vs. \"four on the floor\" ====\nDuring the period when U.S. vehicles usually had only three forward speeds, the most common gear-shifter location was on the steering column, a layout that was sometimes called \"three on the tree\". By contrast, high-performance cars, and European vehicles in general, mostly used a four-speed transmission with floor-mounted shifters. That layout was referred to as \"four on the floor\".\n\nMost [[FR layout|FR (front-engined, rear-wheel drive)]] vehicles have a transmission that sits between the driver and the front passenger seat. Floor-mounted shifters are often connected directly to the transmission. [[FF layout|FF (front-engined, front-wheel drive)]] vehicles, [[RR layout|RR (rear-engined, rear-wheel drive)]] vehicles and front-engined vehicles with rear-mounted gearboxes often require a mechanical linkage to connect the shifter to the transmission.\n\n=== Column-mounted shifter ===\n<!-- [[Three on the tree]] links here -->\n[[File:SAAB96-interior.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Column mounted gear shift lever in a [[Saab 96]]]]\n\nSome vehicles have a gear lever mounted on the steering column. A 3-speed column shifter, which came to be popularly known as a \"three on the tree\", began appearing in America in the late 1930s and became common during the 1940s and 1950s. If a U.S. vehicle was equipped with [[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]], it was very likely to be a [[Borg-Warner]] type, operated by briefly backing off the accelerator  pedal when above {{convert|28|mph|abbr=on}} to enable, and momentarily flooring the same pedal to return to normal gear. The control simply disables overdrive for such situations as parking on a hill or preventing unwanted shifting into overdrive.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[File:Manual Layout 3.svg|125px]]\n\nLater,{{Vague|date=May 2011}} European and Japanese models began to have 4-speed column shifters with this shift pattern:\n\n[[File:Column4MT.svg|125px]]\n\nA majority of American-spec vehicles sold in the U.S. and Canada had a 3-speed column-mounted shifter\u2014the first generation Chevrolet/GMC vans of 1964\u201370 vintage had an ultra-rare 4-speed column shifter. The column-mounted manual shifter disappeared in North America by the mid-1980s, last appearing in the 1987 [[Chevrolet Scottsdale|Chevrolet pickup truck]]. Prior to 1980, the GM X platform compacts (Chevrolet Nova and its rebadged corporate clones) were the final passenger cars to have a column-mounted manual shifter. Outside North America, the column-mounted shifter remained in production. All [[Toyota Crown]] and [[Nissan Cedric]] [[taxicabs of Hong Kong|taxis in Hong Kong]] had the 4-speed column shift until 1999 when automatic transmissions were first offered. Since the late 1980s or early 1990s,{{Vague|date=May 2011}} a 5-speed column shifter has been offered in some vans sold in Asia and Europe, such as [[Toyota Hiace]], [[Mitsubishi Delica|Mitsubishi L400]] and the first-gen [[Fiat Ducato]].\n\nColumn shifters are mechanically similar to floor shifters, although shifting occurs in a vertical plane instead of a horizontal one. Because the shifter is further away from the transmission, and the movements at the shifter and at the transmission are in different planes, column shifters require more complicated [[linkage (mechanical)|linkage]] than floor shifters. Advantages of a column shifter are the ability to switch between the two most commonly used gears\u2014second and third\u2014without letting go of the steering wheel, and the lack of interference with passenger seating space in vehicles equipped with a [[bench seat]].\n\n===Console-mounted shifter===\nSome smaller cars in the 1950s and 1960s, such as [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]], [[Renault 4L]] and early [[Renault 5]] feature a shifter in the dash panel. This was cheaper to manufacture than a column shifter and more practical, as the gearbox was mounted in front of the engine. The linkage for the shifter could then be positioned on top of the engine. The disadvantage is that shifting is less comfortable and usually slower to operate.\n\nNewer small cars and [[minivan|MPV]]s, like the [[Suzuki MR Wagon]], the [[Fiat Multipla]], the [[Toyota Matrix]], the [[Pontiac Vibe]], the [[Chrysler RT platform]] cars, the [[Honda Element]], the [[Honda Civic]], the [[Daihatsu Ayla/Toyota Agya]], and the [[Honda Avancier]], may feature a manual or [[automatic transmission]] gear shifter located on the vehicle's instrument panel, similar to the mid-1950s [[PowerFlite|Chryslers]] and [[Powerglide]] [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]]s. Console-mounted shifters are similar to floor-mounted gear shifters in that most of the ones used in modern vehicles operate on a horizontal plane and can be mounted to the vehicle's transmission in much the same way a floor-mounted shifter can. However, because of the location of the gear shifter in comparison to the locations of the column shifter and the floor shifter, as well as the positioning of the shifter to the rest of the controls on the panel often require that the gearshift be mounted in a space that does not feature a lot of controls integral to the vehicle's operation, or frequently used controls, such as those for the [[car stereo|stereo system]] or [[car air conditioning|HVAC system]], to help prevent accidental activation or driver confusion, especially in [[right-hand drive]] vehicles.\n\nMore and more small cars and vans from manufacturers such as [[Suzuki]], [[Honda]], and [[Volkswagen]] are featuring console shifters in that they free up space on the floor for other features such as storage compartments without requiring that the gear shift be mounted on the steering column. Also, the basic location of the gear shift in comparison to the column shifter makes console shifters easier to operate than column shifters.\n\n===Sequential manual===\n{{Main article|Sequential manual transmission}}\nSome transmissions do not allow the driver to arbitrarily select any gear. Instead, the driver may only ever select the next-lower or next-higher gear ratio. Sequential transmissions often incorporate a synchro-less dog-clutch engagement mechanism (instead of the synchromesh dog clutch common on H-pattern automotive transmissions), in which case the clutch is only necessary when selecting first or reverse gear from neutral, and most gear changes can be performed without the clutch. However, sequential shifting and synchro-less engagement are not inherently linked, though they often occur together due to the environment(s) in which these transmissions are used, such as racing cars and motorcycles.\n\nSequential transmissions are generally controlled by a forward-backward lever, foot pedal, or set of electronic paddle shifters mounted behind the steering wheel. In some cases, these are connected mechanically to the transmission.\n\n===In motorcycles===\nMotorcycles typically employ sequential transmissions, although the shift pattern is modified slightly for safety reasons. In a motorcycle the gears are usually shifted with the left foot pedal, the layout being this:\n[[File:2003 SV650S Gearshift.jpg|thumb|250px|The gear shift lever on a 2003 [[Suzuki SV650S]] motorcycle.]]\n\n'''1 - N - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 (- 6)'''\n\nThe pedal goes one step\u2013both up and down\u2013from the center, before it reaches its limit and has to be allowed to move back to the center position. Thus, changing multiple gears in one direction is accomplished by repeatedly pumping the pedal, either up or down. Although neutral is listed as being between first and second gears for this type of transmission, it \"feels\" more like first and second gear are just \"further away\" from each other than any other two sequential gears. Because this can lead to difficulty in finding neutral for inexperienced riders most motorcycles have a neutral indicator light on the instrument panel to help find neutral. The reason neutral does not actually have its own spot in the sequence is to make it quicker to shift from first to second when moving. Neutral can be accidentally shifted into, though most high end, newer model motorcycles have means of avoiding this.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The reason for having neutral between the first and second gears instead of at the bottom is that when stopped, the rider can just click down repeatedly and know that they will end up in first and not neutral. This allows riders to quickly move their bikes from a standstill in an emergency situation. This may also help on a steep hill on which high torque is required. It could be disadvantageous or even dangerous to attempt to be in first without realizing it, then try for a lower gear, only to get neutral.\n\nOn motorcycles used on race tracks, the shifting pattern is often reversed, that is, the rider clicks down to upshift. This usage pattern increases the [[ground clearance]] by placing the rider's foot above the shift lever when the rider is most likely to need it, namely when leaning over and exiting a tight turn.\n\nThe shift pattern for most [[underbone]] or [[Minibike|miniature]] motorcycles with an automatic [[centrifugal clutch]] is also modified for two key reasons\u2014to enable the less-experienced riders to shift the gears without problems of \"finding\" neutral, and also due to the greater force needed to \"lift\" the gearshift lever (because the gearshift pedal of an underbone motorcycle also operates the clutch). The gearshift lever of an underbone has two ends. The rider clicks down the front end with the left toe all the way to the top gear and clicks down the rear end with the heel all the way down to neutral, while miniatures still retain a single-end lever, with the rider clicks down to upshift and lift the lever up to downshift (or vice versa). Some underbone models such as the [[Honda Wave series|Honda Wave]] have a \"rotary\" shift pattern, which means that the rider can shift directly to neutral from the top gear, but for safety reasons this is only possible when the motorcycle is stationary. Some models also have gear position indicators for all gear positions at the instrument panel.\n\n===Automated manual===\nAlso called '''Automated-clutch manual'''. Some new transmissions ([[Alfa Romeo]]'s [[Selespeed]] gearbox, [[BMW]]'s ''Sequential Manual Gearbox'' (SMG) and [[Ferrari]]'s \"F1\" electrohydraulic automated gearbox, for example) are conventional manual transmissions with a computerized control mechanism. These transmissions feature independently selectable gears but do not have a physical [[clutch]] pedal. Instead, the transmission computer automates a [[Servomechanism|servo]] which [[wikt:disengage|disengage]]s the clutch when necessary.\n\nThese transmissions vary from a sequential manual transmission, in that they still allow nonsequential shifts: the \"SMG\" system formerly used by BMW, for example, could shift from 6th gear directly to 4th gear.\n\nAn early version of this type of transmission was the [[Autostick]], which was used in the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and [[Karmann Ghia]] from 1967 to 1976, where the clutch was disengaged by servo when the driver pushed downward slightly on the gear shift lever. This was a 3-speed unit.\n\nIn the case of the early [[Saab 900 (NG)|second generation Saab 900]], a 'Sensonic' option was available where gears were shifted with a conventional shifter, but the clutch is controlled by a computer.\n\nSee [[semi-automatic transmission|Automated manual transmission]] for more examples.\n\n===Short shifter===\n\n[[File:Shortshifter.jpg|thumb|Comparison between a stock shifter and a short shifter]]\n\nA '''short shifter''', also known as a '''short throw shifter''', is the result of an [[automotive aftermarket]] modification of the manual transmissions' stick shift either by modification of the existing stick shift or, alternately, by the replacement of the entire part.\n\nThe purpose of the modification is to mechanically reduce time between the changing of [[gear]]s while accelerating or decelerating, thus improving the automobiles' performance. The modification of the existing stick shift, also known as a manual [[gear stick]], can take two forms: either the physical shortening of the existing stick shift, known in the industry as 'chopping', or bending. By reducing the length of the stick shift, the distance it must travel to change gears is effectively reduced, thus reducing the time spent shifting. At the same time, the amount of force required to shift increases due to a shorter lever.\n\nSome major vehicle manufacturers such as [[Subaru]], [[Mazda]], and [[Porsche]] offer short shifters as stock modifications such as in the [[Subaru WRX]], [[Subaru WRX STI]], [[Subaru BRZ]], [[Mazda Miata]], and as an option such as in the [[Porsche 911]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091023041748/http://www.boston.com/cars/newsandreviews/overdrive/2009/10/2009_mazda_mx5_miata_more_tech.html] </ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.porsche.com/usa/accessoriesandservices/personalisation/tequipment/911-996/performance/n163/ |title=Short Shifter - Performance - Tequipment 911 (Type 996) - Dr. Ing. h.c.

Its system is made by [[Robert Bosch GmbH]]. Sometimes it is also referred as Electro-pneumatic gearbox or Finger control transmission (FCT).\n\nIn shift operations using mechanical link mechanisms in rear-engined buses, the FCT detected the position of the shift lever and converted it into an electronic signal. These signals were then used to perform transmission changes using air pressure. This resulted in easy shift changes and reduced driver fatigue, and also reduced the weight of the link mechanism. A pseudo-reaction force was added to the operation to reduce driver discomfort. Moreover, elaborate fail-safe mechanisms were incorporated, such as one that prevented mis-shifts, and one that assured safe driving in the event of system failure. The FCT was used in MP series heavy duty route buses from November 1983 after basic research and multiple prototypes and practical tests over 10 years. It gained popularity in combination with measures to assist older drivers, and in the following year, it was applied to large heavy duty tour buses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jsae.or.jp/autotech/data_e/8-5e.html|title=240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology - Finger control transmission (FCT)|author=|date=|work=jsae.or.jp|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Benefits==\n===Fuel economy===\nThe manual transmission couples the engine to the transmission with a rigid clutch instead of the [[torque converter]] on an automatic transmission or the v-belt of a continuously variable transmission,<ref>[http://staff.bath.ac.uk/enssa/thesis.pdf An Investigation into The Loss Mechanisms associated with a Pushing Metal V-Belt Continuously Variable Transmission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912055243/http://staff.bath.ac.uk/enssa/thesis.pdf |date=12 September 2005 }}, Sam Akehurst, 2001, PhD Thesis, University of Bath.</ref> which slip by nature. Manual transmissions also lack the parasitic power consumption of the automatic transmission's hydraulic pump. Also, manual transmissions do not require active cooling and because they are, mechanically, much simpler than automatic transmissions, they generally weigh less than comparable automatics, which can improve economy in stop-and-go traffic.<ref name=\"fueleconomy\"/>. Because of this, manual transmissions generally offer better [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] than automatic or continuously variable transmissions; however the disparity has been somewhat offset with the introduction of locking torque converters on automatic transmissions.<ref name=\"fueleconomy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov |title=U.S. Department of Energy vehicle fuel economy website |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> Increased fuel economy with a properly operated manual transmission vehicle versus an equivalent automatic transmission vehicle can range from 5% to about 15% depending on driving conditions and style of driving.<ref name=efficiency>[http://www.sae.org/servlets/productDetail?PROD_TYP=PAPER&PROD_CD=1999-01-1259 An Overview of Current Automatic, Manual and Continuously Variable Transmission Efficiencies and Their Projected Future Improvements], Kluger and Long, SAE 1999-01-1259</ref> The lack of [[#Performance and control|control]] over downshifting under load in an automatic transmission, coupled with a typical vehicle engine's greater efficiency under higher [[Brake specific fuel consumption#The use of BSFC numbers as operating values and as a cycle average statistic|load]], can enable additional fuel gains from a manual transmission by allowing the operator to keep the engine performing under a more efficient load/RPM combination. This is especially true as between manual and automatic versions of older models, as more recent advances including variable valve timing reduce the efficiency disadvantages of automatic transmissions by allowing better performance over a broader RPM range. In recognition of this, many current models (2010 and on) come with manual modes, or overrides on automatic models, although the degree of control varies greatly by the manufacturer.  However this gap in economy is being rapidly closed, and many mid- to higher-end model automatic vehicles now get better economy than their standard-spec counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} This is in part due to the increasing impact of computers co-ordinating multiple systems, particularly in hybrid models in which the engine and drive motors must be managed, as well as using more gears and more efficient gear ratios or different automatic technology such as CVTs and dual-clutch automatics.\n\n===Longevity===\nBecause manual transmissions are mechanically simpler, are more easily manufactured, and have fewer moving parts than automatic transmissions, they require less maintenance and are easier as well as cheaper to repair. Due to their mechanical simplicity, they often last longer than automatic transmissions when used by a skilled driver. Typically, there are no electrical components, pumps and cooling mechanisms in a manual transmission, other than an internal switch to activate reversing lighting. These attributes become extremely vital with a vehicle stuck in mud, snow, etc. The back and forth rocking motion of the vehicle drivers use to dislodge a stuck vehicle can destroy automatic transmissions. Clutches are a wear item that may need to be replaced at some point in the vehicle's lifespan, however the service life of the clutch depends on the operating conditions that it is subjected to.\n\n===Cost===\nThe price of a new vehicle with a manual transmission tends to be lower than the same vehicle with an automatic transmission.\n\nMost new vehicles are available with manual or automatic transmissions. There is often a difference in cost between the two. Manual transmissions generally cost less than automatic transmissions. For example, the base price of a [[Chevrolet]] Cruze 2LT with a manual transmission is $22,120, while the base price of the automatic is $23,405\u2014a difference of $1,285.\n\n===Lubrication===\nMost manual transmissions rely on [[Bearing (mechanical)#Splash lubrication|splash lubrication]] although some five speed Rover gearboxes did incorporate an oil pump. The problem with splash lubrication is that it is speed dependent. There are centrifugal effects, hydrodynamic effects and effects from the gears working as pumps. If a gearbox is fitted with Perspex windows and run on a test rig these effects can be observed. As the gearbox is run through its rev range, the oil jets will switch over and move around. Research on the Austin Maxi 1500 gearbox showed that one of the ball races was running dry at {{convert|80|mph|km/h}}. The solution was to alter the casting to include a small projection that would intercept the main oil jet that was present at 80&nbsp;mph and disperse it. This small modification enabled the later Maxi 1750 gearbox to be relatively trouble free. Four speed gearboxes seldom show these problems because at top speed (and maximum power) they are basically a solid shaft and the gears are not transmitting power.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Performance and control===\nManual transmissions have generally offered a wider selection of gear ratios. Many vehicles offer a 5-speed or 6-speed manual, whereas the automatic option would typically be a 4-speed. This is generally due to the increased space available inside a manual transmission compared with an automatic, since the latter requires extra components for self-shifting, such as torque converters and pumps. However, automatic transmissions are now adding more speeds as the technology matures. [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] currently manufactures 7- and 8-speed automatic transmissions. ZF is also planning a 9-speed automatic for use in front-wheel drive vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/mopar/transmissions/ZF9.html|title=ZF 9-Speed Automatic Transmission for Chrysler and Dodge cars|author=|date=|work=allpar.com|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref> The increased number of gears allows for better use of the engine's [[power band]], resulting in increased fuel economy by staying in the most fuel-efficient part of the power band, or higher performance, thereby remaining closer to the engine's peak power rating. Even with more forward speeds and the potential of designing more forward gears to offer higher speed and/or torque, the manual transmission remains smaller and much more compact than its larger, automatic cousin, as referenced by the [[Porsche 991|991 Generation of the Porsche 911]] and the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C7)|C7 Chevrolet Corvette]], which offer a 7-speed manual transmission.\n\n===Engine braking===\nIn contrast to most manual gearboxes, most automatic transmissions have far less effective engine-braking. This means that the engine does not slow the vehicle as effectively when the automatic transmission driver releases the engine speed control. This leads to more usage of the brakes in vehicles with automatic transmissions, bringing shorter brake life. Brakes are also more likely to overheat in hilly or mountainous areas, causing reduced braking ability, [[brake fade]], and the potential for complete failure with the automatic transmission vehicle.\n\n=== Push starting ===\nVehicles with a manual transmission can often be [[push start]]ed when the starter motor is not operational, usually due to a low battery.\n\nWhen push starting, the energy generated by the wheels moving on the road is transferred to the driveshaft, then the transmission and eventually the crankshaft. When the crankshaft spins as a result of the energy generated by the rolling of the vehicle, the motor is cranked over. This simulates what the starter is intended for and operates in a similar way to crank handles on very old cars from the early 20th century, with the cranking motion being replaced by the pushing of the car.\n\n==Drawbacks==\n===Complexity and learning curve===\nFor most people, there is a slight [[learning curve]] with a manual transmission, which may be intimidating and unappealing for a novice driver. Because the driver must develop a feel for properly engaging the clutch, an inexperienced driver will often release the clutch pedal abruptly, causing the engine to stall. Most drivers can learn how to drive a vehicle with a manual transmission in as little as an hour, although it may take weeks before it becomes \"second nature\". Additionally, if an inexperienced driver selects an inappropriate gear by mistake, damage to mechanical components and even loss of control can occur if not rectified quickly. \nLearning clutch/throttle pedal coordination can be made easier by using the clutch pedal ''only'', on a level surface. This will allow the operator to gauge where the \"sweet spot\" of clutch engagement is. \nCorrect \"release speed\" of the clutch pedal (''slow'' for smooth, ''fast'' for abrupt) will indicate when and where throttle pedal use should occur.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, such as the [[United Kingdom]], a driving licence issued for only vehicles with an automatic transmission is not valid for driving vehicles with a manual transmission, but a licence for manual transmissions covers both.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/driving-licence-categories|title=Driving licence categories - GOV.UK|author=|date=|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref> This is also the case for P1 (provisional-1) car licence holders in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], but P2 (provisional-2) licence holders are allowed to drive vehicles with either transmission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/stayingsafe/drivers/youngdrivers/licence-conditions/index.html|author=NSW|title=Licence conditions - Younger drivers - Drivers - Staying safe - NSW Centre for Road Safety|date=2014-11-10}}</ref>\n\n===Shifting speed===\nAutomatic transmissions can typically shift ratios faster than a manual gear change can be accomplished, due to the time required for the average driver to push the clutch pedal to the floor and move the gearstick from one position to another. This is especially true in regards to [[dual-clutch transmission]]s, which are specialized computer-controlled automatic transmissions that mechanically operate more like a manual transmission than a traditional automatic one.\n\n===Ease of use===\nBecause manual transmissions require the operation of an extra pedal, and keeping the vehicle in the correct gear at all times, they require more concentration, especially in heavy traffic situations. The automatic transmissions, on the other hand, simply require the driver to speed up or slow down as needed, with the vehicle doing the work of choosing an appropriate gear. Manual transmissions also place a greater workload on the driver in heavy traffic situations, when the driver must operate the clutch pedal quite often. Because the clutch pedal can require a substantial amount of force, especially on large trucks, and the long pedal travel compared to the brake or accelerator requires moving the entire leg, not just the foot near the ankle, a manual transmission can cause fatigue, and is more difficult for injured people to drive. Additionally, because automatic transmissions can be driven with only one foot, people with one leg that is missing or impaired can still drive, unlike the manual transmission that requires the use of two feet at once. Likewise, manual transmissions require the driver to remove one hand periodically from the steering wheel while the vehicle is in motion, which can be difficult or impossible to do safely for people with a missing or impaired arm, and requires increased coordination, even for those with full use of both hands.\n\n===Stopping on hills===\nThe clutch experiences most of its wear in first gear because moving the vehicle from a standstill involves a great deal of friction at the clutch. When accelerating from a standstill on an incline, this problem is made worse because the amount of work needed to overcome the acceleration of gravity causes the clutch to heat up considerably more. For this reason, stop-and-go driving and hills tend to have an effect on the clutches to a certain degree.\nAutomatic transmissions are better suited for these applications because they have a hydraulic torque converter which is externally cooled, unlike a clutch. Torque converters also do not have a friction material that rubs off over time like a clutch. Some automatics even lock the output shaft so that the vehicle cannot roll backwards when beginning to accelerate up an incline. To reduce wear in these applications, some manual transmissions will have a very low, \"granny\" gear which provides the leverage to move the vehicle easily at very low speeds. This reduces wear at the clutch because the transmission requires less input torque. However, the issue of ''handling stops on hills'' is easy to learn.\n\nMany drivers use the parking brake to prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards when starting to accelerate up a steep hill. This saves precious clutch life. A device called the [[hill-holder]] was introduced on the 1936 Studebaker. Some modern manual vehicles such as the [[Dodge Challenger]] and most [[Subaru]] models have a \"[[hill-start assist]]\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Lampton |first=Christopher |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/car-driving-safety/safety-regulatory-devices/hill-start-control.htm |title=How Hill-Start Control Works &#124; HowStuffWorks |website=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2009-10-05 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}</ref> feature. The vehicle's computer applies just enough brake pressure to prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards. This allows the driver to start normally with no additional effort, even on steep hills.\n\nStarting on a hill with the aid of the parking brake is not always possible since in recent vehicles that feature an [[electric park brake]] the parking brake can only be released when the brake pedal is engaged.\n\n==Applications and popularity==\nSports cars are also often equipped with manual transmissions because they offer more direct driver involvement and better performance, though this is changing as many automakers move to faster dual-clutch transmissions, which are generally shifted with paddles located behind the steering wheel. For example, the 991 [[Porsche 911 GT3]] uses Porsche's PDK. Off-road vehicles and trucks often feature manual transmissions because they allow direct gear selection and are often more rugged than their automatic counterparts.\n\nConversely, manual transmissions are no longer popular in many classes of vehicles sold in North America, Australia, and some parts of Asia, although they remain dominant in other parts of Asia, and in Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Nearly all vehicles are available with an automatic transmission option, and family vehicles and large pickup trucks sold in the US are predominantly fitted with automatics. However, in some cases, if a buyer wishes, they can have the vehicle fitted with a manual transmission at the factory. In Europe, most vehicles are sold with manual transmissions. Most luxury vehicles are only available with an automatic transmission. In most cases where both transmissions are available for a given model of vehicle, automatics are an at-cost option, but in some cases the reverse is true. Some vehicles, such as [[rental car|rental]]s and [[taxicab]]s, are nearly universally equipped with automatic transmissions in countries such as the [[United States]], but the opposite is true in [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ricksteves.com/plan/tips/carrental_2005.htm |title=Rick Steve's Europe: Driving in Europe |publisher=Ricksteves.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> As of 2008, 75.2% of vehicles made in Western Europe were equipped with manual transmission, versus 16.1% with automatic and 8.7% with other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dctfacts.com/archive/2008/why-dual-clutch-technology-big-business.aspx |title=Why Dual Clutch Technology Will Be Big Business |publisher=Dctfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref>\n\nWhen a driver passes their driving test using a vehicle with an [[automatic transmission]], in some jurisdictions; the resulting driving licence is restricted to the use of vehicles with automatic transmissions only. This is the case in countries such as [[New Zealand]] (for the second-phase Restricted license, but not the final Full license), the [[European Union]] with the exception of member countries that opt to disallow road tests on automatic vehicles completely, [[China]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Norway]], [[Philippines]], [[Russia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]], [[South Korea]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United Arab Emirates|U.A.E]]. This treatment of the manual transmission skill seems to maintain the widespread use of the manual transmission.{{citation_needed|date=February 2019}} As many new drivers worry that their restricted license will become an obstacle for them where most vehicles have manual transmissions, they make the effort to learn with manual transmissions and obtain full licenses. Some other countries (such as [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Portugal]], [[Malaysia]], [[Serbia]], [[Brazil]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Denmark]]) go even further, whereby the license is granted only when a test is passed on a manual transmission. In Denmark and Brazil, drivers are allowed to sit the test in an automatic vehicle if they are disabled, but with such a license they will not be allowed to drive a vehicle with a manual transmission.\n\n==Truck transmissions==\nSome trucks have transmissions that look and behave like ordinary consumer vehicle transmissions\u2014these transmissions are used on lighter trucks, typically have up to 6 gears, and usually have [[manual transmission#Unsynchronized transmission|synchromesh]].\n\nFor trucks needing more gears, the standard \"H\" pattern can get very complicated, so additional controls are used to select additional gears. The \"H\" pattern is retained, then an additional control selects among alternatives. In older trucks, the control is often a separate lever mounted on the floor or more recently a pneumatic switch mounted on the \"H\" lever; in newer trucks the control is often an electrical switch mounted on the \"H\" lever. Multi-control transmissions are built in much higher power ratings, but rarely use synchromesh.\n\nThere are several common alternatives for the shifting pattern. Usual types are:\n\n*'''Range transmissions''' use an \"H\" pattern through a narrow range of gears, then a \"range\" control shifts the \"H\" pattern between high and low ranges. For example, an 8-speed range transmission has an H shift pattern with four gears. The first through fourth gears are accessed when low range is selected. To access the fifth through eighth gears, the range selector is moved to high range, and the gear lever again shifted through the first through fourth gear positions. In high range, the first gear position becomes fifth, the second gear position becomes sixth, and so on.\n*'''Splitter transmissions''' use an \"H\" pattern with a wide range of gears, and the other selector splits each sequential gear position in two: First gear is in first position/low split, second gear is in first position/high split, third gear is in second position/low split, fourth gear is in second position/high split, and so on.\n*'''Range-Splitter transmissions''' combine range-splitting and gear-splitting. This allows even more gear ratios. Both a range selector and a splitter selector are provided.\n\nAlthough there are many gear positions, shifting through gears usually follows a regular pattern. For example, a series of upshifts might use \"move to splitter direct; move to splitter overdrive; move shift lever to No.&nbsp;2 and move splitter to underdrive; move splitter to direct; move splitter to overdrive; move shift lever to No.&nbsp;3 and move splitter to underdrive\"; and so on. In older trucks using floor-mounted levers, a bigger problem is common gear shifts require the drivers to move their hands between shift levers in a single shift, and without synchromesh, shifts must be carefully timed or the transmission will not engage. For this reason, some splitter transmissions have an additional \"under under\" range, so when the splitter is already in \"under\" it can be quickly downshifted again, without the delay of a double shift.\n\nToday's truck transmissions are most commonly \"range-splitter\". The most common 13-speed has a standard H pattern, and the pattern from left upper corner is as follows: R, down to L, over and up to 1, down to 2, up and over to 3, down to 4. The \"butterfly\" range lever in the center front of the knob is flipped up to high range while in 4th, then shifted back to 1. The 1 through 4 positions of the knob are repeated. Also, each can be split using the thumb-actuated under-overdrive lever on the left side of the knob while in high range. The \"thumb\" lever is not available in low range, except in 18 speeds; 1 through 4 in low range can be split using the thumb lever and L can be split with the \"Butterfly\" lever. L cannot be split using the thumb lever in either the 13- or 18-speed. The 9-speed transmission is basically a 13-speed without the under-overdrive thumb lever.\n\nTruck transmissions use many physical layouts. For example, the output of an N-speed transmission may drive an M-speed secondary transmission, giving a total of N*M gear combinations; for example a 4-speed main box and 3-speed splitter gives 12 ratios. Transmissions may be in separate cases with a shaft in between; in separate cases bolted together; or all in one case, using the same lubricating oil. The second transmission is often called a \"Brownie\" or \"Brownie box\" after a popular brand. With a third transmission, gears are multiplied yet again, giving greater range or closer spacing. Some trucks thus have dozens of gear positions, although most are duplicates. Sometimes a secondary transmission is integrated with the differential in the rear axle, called a \"two-speed rear end\". Two-speed differentials are always splitters. In newer transmissions, there may be two countershafts, so each main shaft gear can be driven from one or the other countershaft; this allows construction with short and robust countershafts, while still allowing many gear combinations inside a single gear case.\n\nHeavy-duty transmissions are almost always [[Non-synchronous transmission|non-synchromesh]]. One argument is synchromesh adds weight that could be payload, is one more thing to fail, and drivers spend thousands of hours driving so can take the time to learn to drive efficiently with a non-synchromesh transmission. Heavy-duty trucks driven frequently in city traffic, such as cement mixers, need to be shifted very often and in stop-and-go traffic. Since few heavy-duty transmissions have synchromesh, [[automatic transmission]]s are commonly used instead, despite their increased weight, cost, and loss of efficiency.\n\nHeavy trucks are usually powered with [[diesel engine]]s. Diesel truck engines from the 1970s and earlier tend to have a narrow power band, so need many close-spaced gears. Starting with the 1968 [[Mack Trucks#Maxidyne engine|Maxidyne]], diesel truck engines have increasingly used turbochargers and electronic controls that widen the power band, allowing fewer and fewer gear ratios. A transmission with fewer ratios is lighter and may be more efficient due to fewer transmissions in series. Fewer shifts also makes the truck more drivable. As of 2005, fleet operators often use 9, 10, 13 or 18-speed transmissions, but automated manual and semi-automatic transmissions are becoming more common on heavy vehicles, as they can improve efficiency and drivability, reduce the barrier to entry for new drivers, and may improve safety by allowing the driver to concentrate on road conditions. {{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Crash gearbox==\n[[File:Three-speed crash gearbox, schematic (Autocar Handbook, 13th ed, 1935).jpg|right|thumb|Diagram showing a three-speed gearbox. First, Second and Reverse gears are 'crash' engagement, while third is direct drive. The constant-mesh gears drive the layshaft for first, second, and reverse.]]\nA '''crash gearbox''', also known as a '''crash box''', is a [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] type used in old cars, trucks, and other automotive vehicles. It is more properly called a \"sliding mesh\" gearbox and has the nickname \"crash\" because it is difficult to change gears, so gear changes are often accompanied by loud noises. The etymology of \"crash\" is probably \"clash\".\n\nIn a sliding-mesh gearbox, individual gears are mounted so they always engage the shaft, but gears on one shaft can be moved axially. To engage a particular pair of gears, one gear is slid axially until it fully engages a gear on the other shaft. If the gear shafts are spinning so the two gears have the same surface speed, the gears are relatively easy to engage. However, if speeds are mismatched, the gears tend to \"bounce\" off each other at first contact and resist engagement. Thus, gear engagement relies on the driver carefully matching speeds, typically through practice and intuition.\n\nIn contrast, newer \"constant mesh\" transmissions use gears that are held axially, but gears on one shaft spin freely on the shaft. Gear pairs in the transmission are always in mesh, though at most one is engaged at any time. Each free-spinning gear has a [[dog clutch]] which is engaged by an axial sliding collar that transfers power to the shaft. The dog clutch may be plain, also called \"non-synchromesh\", or may use an additional [[Synchromesh gearbox|synchromesh]] mechanism that helps get the parts moving at the same speed to assist engagement. Many constant mesh transmissions use a sliding-mesh gear for reverse, but since reverse is only engaged from near a stop, it is still easy to engage.\n\nA constant-mesh transmission offers several advantages over a sliding-mesh design. First, the dog clutch is designed for the task, rather than asking the gear to do dual duty of power transmission and sliding engagement. Second, any shock from engagement of the dog clutch is spread out among many teeth rather than just one or two teeth on the gears themselves. This greatly reduces the resulting stress when gears are engaged. Third, the dog clutch is typically smaller in diameter than the gear it controls, so absolute speeds of the engaging parts are lower, aiding engagement. Thus, while a non-synchromesh transmission still relies on the operator to match speeds, gears are easier to engage. Fourth, a constant-mesh transmission can easily use [[Gear#Helical gears|helical gears]] which are smoother, quieter, and can carry more torque for a given size of gear. Fifth, a constant-mesh transmission can use synchromesh for easier shifting; while many heavy vehicle transmissions do not use it, most medium- and light-duty automotive transmissions do.\n\n==Maintenance==\nBecause clutches use changes in [[friction]] to modulate the transfer of torque between engine and transmission, they are subject to wear in everyday use. A very good clutch, when used by an expert driver, can last hundreds of thousands of kilometres (or miles). Weak clutches, abrupt downshifting, inexperienced drivers, and aggressive driving can lead to more frequent repair or replacement. Other factors that can lead to excessive clutch wear include increased urban driving (since the clutch is used more for a given distance travelled) and excessively tall gearing (which requires more slippage of the clutch to start from a standing stop).\n\nManual transmissions are lubricated with gear oil or engine oil in some vehicles, which must be changed periodically in some vehicles, although not as frequently as the fluid in an automatic transmission. Some manufacturers specify that changing the gear oil is never necessary except after transmission work or to rectify a leak. However, manual transmission oil is usually not filtered and accumulates metal particles from normal wear. Also, manual transmission oil has additives (such as friction modifiers to improve synchro function) which lose effectiveness with time. For these reasons, it is best to periodically change transmission oil, even on vehicles which specify a \u2018lifetime fill\u2019.\n\nGear oil has a characteristic aroma due to the addition of sulfur-bearing anti-wear compounds. These compounds are used to reduce the high [[sliding friction]] by the [[helical gear]] cut of the teeth (this cut eliminates the characteristic whine of straight cut [[spur gear]]s). On motorcycles with \"wet\" clutches (clutch is bathed in engine oil), there is usually nothing separating the lower part of the engine from the transmission, so the same oil lubricates both the engine and transmission. The original [[Mini]] placed the gearbox in the oil sump below the engine, thus using the same oil for both. The clutch was however a fairly conventional dry plate clutch.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"175px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:Manual transmission clutch Reverse gear.PNG|Reverse (green engaged)\nImage:Manual transmission clutch Neutral.PNG|Neutral (blue and purple in the middle, green disengaged)\nImage:Manual transmission clutch First gear.PNG|First gear (blue, to back)\nImage:Manual transmission clutch Second gear.PNG|Second gear (blue, to front)\nImage:Manual transmission clutch Third gear.PNG|Third gear (purple, to back)\nImage:Manual transmission clutch Fourth gear.PNG|Fourth gear (purple, to front)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons}}\n*[[Automatic transmission]]\n*[[Diesel\u2013electric transmission]]\n*[[Freewheel]]\n*[[Gear train]]\n*[[Torque converter|Hydraulic transmission]]\n*[[Transmission (mechanics)]]\n*[[Non-synchronous transmission]]\n*[[Overdrive (mechanics)|Overdrive]]\n*[[Preselector gearbox]]\n*[[Ford Toploader transmission]]\n**[[Borg-Warner T-56 transmission]]\n**[[G56 manual transmission]]\n**[[New Venture Gear 5600 transmission]]\n**[[New Venture Gear 4500 transmission]]\n**[[New Venture Gear 3500 transmission]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Powertrain}}\n{{Gears}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Manual Transmission}}\n[[Category:Automotive transmission technologies]]\n[[Category:Automobile transmissions]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Type of transmission used in motor vehicle applications}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2015}}\n{{Original research|date=February 2009}}}}\n{{transmission types}}\n[[File:Shift stick.jpg|thumb|right|A floor-mounted gear lever in a 1999 Mazda Protege with a 5-speed manual transmission]][[File:Gearbox 4gears.gif|thumb|right|Animation: shifting mechanism of a gearbox with 4 gears]][[File:Gearbox 4gears sequential.gif|thumb|right|Animation: gear selection in a sequential gearbox]]\nA '''manual transmission''', also known as a '''manual gearbox''', a '''standard transmission''', '''stick shift''', or simply '''gearbox''', is a type of [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] used in [[motor vehicle]] applications. It uses a driver-operated [[clutch]], usually engaged and disengaged by a foot pedal or hand lever, for regulating [[torque]] transfer from the [[internal combustion engine|engine]] to the transmission; and a [[gear selector]] that can be operated by hand.\n\nA conventional 5- or 6-speed manual transmission is often the standard equipment in a modern base model vehicle, with 5- speed being common on lower end vehicles and commercial vehicles.  Higher end vehicles, such as [[sports car]]s and [[luxury car]]s are often usually equipped with a 6-speed transmission for the base model. Other options include automatic transmissions such as a [[automatic transmission|traditional automatic (hydraulic planetary) transmission]] (often a [[manumatic]]), an [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| automated manual transmission]], or a [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT). The number of forward gear ratios is often expressed for automatic transmissions as well (e.g., 9-speed automatic).\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:0762 Spinning Levers 04 45 20 00 3mb.webm|thumb|1936 film of automobile gearbox]]\nManual transmissions often feature a [[driving|driver]]-operated [[clutch]] and a movable [[gear stick]]. Most automobile manual transmissions allow the driver to select any forward [[gear ratio]] (\"gear\") at any time, but some, such as those commonly mounted on [[motorcycle]]s and some types of racing cars, only allow the driver to select the next-higher or next-lower gear. This type of transmission is sometimes called a [[sequential manual transmission]].\n\nIn a manual transmission, the [[flywheel]] is attached to the engine's [[crankshaft]] and spins along with it. The [[clutch]] disc is in between the [[pressure plate]] and the flywheel, and is held against the flywheel under pressure from the pressure plate. When the engine is running and the clutch is engaged (i.e., clutch pedal up), the flywheel spins the clutch plate and hence the transmission. As the clutch pedal is depressed, the [[Thrust bearing|throw out bearing]] is activated, which causes the pressure plate to stop applying pressure to the clutch disk. This makes the clutch plate stop receiving power from the engine so that the gear can be shifted without damaging the transmission. When the clutch pedal is released, the throw out bearing is deactivated, and the clutch disk is again held against the flywheel, allowing it to start receiving power from the engine.\n\nWith manual transmissions, gear ratios can be selected by locking selected gear pairs to the output shaft inside the transmission. Conversely, most [[automatic transmission]]s feature [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic]] ([[epicyclic gearing|planetary]]) gearing controlled by brake bands and/or clutch packs to select gear ratio. [[Automatic transmission]]s that allow the driver to manually select the current gear are called [[manumatic]]s. A manual-style transmission operated by computer is often called an ''automated'' transmission rather than an ''automatic'', even though no distinction between the two terms need be made.\n\nContemporary automobile manual transmissions typically use four to six forward gear ratios and one reverse gear, although consumer automobile manual transmissions have been built with as few as two and as many as seven gears. Transmissions for heavy trucks and other heavy equipment usually have 8 to 25 gears, so that there are both a wide range of gears and close gear ratios to keep the engine running in the [[power band]]. Operating such transmissions often uses the same pattern of shifter movement with a single or multiple switches to engage the next sequence of gears.\n\n==Unsynchronized transmission {{anchor|Constant-mesh gearbox}} ==\n{{main article|Non-synchronous transmission}}\n[[File:PSM V57 D608 Cherrier two speed gear.png|thumb|right|Cherrier two speed gear, circa 1900<ref>[[Wikisource:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 57/August 1900/The Evolution and Present Status of the Automobile]]</ref>\n]]\nFrench inventors Louis-Rene Panhard and Emile Levassor are credited with the development of the  first modern manual transmission. They demonstrated their three-speed transmission in 1894 and the basic design is still the starting point for most contemporary manual transmissions. This type of transmission offered multiple gear ratios and, in most cases, reverse. The gears were typically engaged by sliding them on their shafts (hence the phrase ''shifting gears''), which required careful timing and [[throttle]] manipulation when shifting, so the gears would be spinning at roughly the same speed when engaged; otherwise, the teeth would refuse to mesh. These transmissions are called ''sliding mesh'' transmissions or sometimes [[Non-synchronous transmission|crash boxes]], because of the difficulty in changing gears and the loud grinding sound that often accompanied. Newer manual transmissions on 4+-wheeled vehicles have all gears mesh at all times and are referred to as ''constant-mesh'' transmissions, with \"synchro-mesh\" being a further refinement of the constant mesh principle.\n\nIn both types, a particular gear combination can only be engaged when the two parts to engage (either gears or clutches) are at the same speed. To shift to a higher gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the engine allowed to slow down until the transmission parts for the next gear are at a proper speed to engage. The vehicle also slows while in neutral and that slows other transmission parts, so the time in neutral depends on the grade, wind, and other such factors. To shift to a lower gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the throttle is used to speed up the engine and thus the relevant transmission parts, to match speeds for engaging the next lower gear. For both upshifts and downshifts, the clutch is released (engaged) while in neutral. Some drivers use the clutch only for starting from a stop, and shifts are done without the clutch. Other drivers will depress (disengage) the clutch, shift to neutral, then engage the clutch momentarily to force transmission parts to match the engine speed, then depress the clutch again to shift to the next gear, a process called [[Double clutch (technique)|double clutching]]. Double clutching is easier to get smooth, as speeds that are close but not quite matched need to speed up or slow down only transmission parts, whereas with the clutch engaged to the engine, mismatched speeds are fighting the rotational inertia and power of the engine.\n\nEven though automobile and light truck transmissions are now almost universally synchronized, transmissions for heavy [[truck]]s and machinery, motorcycles, and for dedicated [[automobile racing|racing]] are usually not. [[Non-synchronous transmission|Non-synchronized transmission]] designs are used for several reasons. The friction material, such as [[brass]], in synchronizers is more prone to wear and breakage than gears, which are forged steel, and the simplicity of the mechanism improves reliability and reduces cost. In addition, the process of shifting a non-synchromesh transmission is faster than that of shifting a synchromesh transmission. For racing of production-based transmissions, sometimes half the teeth on the dog clutches are removed to speed the shifting process, at the expense of greater wear.\n\nHeavy duty trucks often use unsynchronized transmissions, though military trucks usually have synchronized transmissions, allowing untrained personnel to operate them in emergencies. In the United States, traffic safety rules refer to [[non-synchronous transmission]]s in classes of larger [[commercial motor vehicle]]s. In Europe, heavy duty trucks use synchronized gearboxes as standard.\n\nSimilarly, most modern motorcycles use unsynchronized transmissions: their low gear inertias and higher strengths mean that forcing the gears to alter speed is not damaging, and the pedal operated selector on modern motorcycles, with no neutral position between gears (except, commonly, 1st and 2nd), is not conducive to having the long [[shift time]] of a synchronized gearbox. On bikes with a 1-N-2(-3-4...) transmission, it is necessary either to stop, slow down, or synchronize gear speeds by blipping the throttle when shifting from 2nd into 1st.\n\n==Synchronized transmission==\n[[File:Ford Design 3-speed OD Transmission w. Hurst Shifter.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Top and side view of a typical manual transmission, in this case a Ford [[Ford Toploader transmission|Toploader]], used in vehicles with external floor shifters.]]\n\nMost modern manual-transmission vehicles are fitted with a synchronized gear box. Transmission gears are always in mesh and rotating, but gears on one shaft can freely rotate or be locked to the shaft. The locking mechanism for a gear consists of a collar (or ''[[dog clutch|dog collar]]'') on the shaft which is able to slide sideways so that teeth (or ''dogs'') on its inner surface bridge two circular rings with teeth on their outer circumference: one attached to the gear, one to the shaft hub. When the rings are bridged by the collar, that particular gear is rotationally locked to the shaft and determines the output speed of the transmission. The gearshift lever manipulates the collars using a set of [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkages]], so arranged so that one collar may be permitted to lock only one gear at any one time; when \"shifting gears\", the locking collar from one gear is disengaged before that of another is engaged. One collar often serves for two gears; sliding in one direction selects one transmission speed, in the other direction selects another.\n\nIn a synchromesh gearbox, to correctly match the speed of the gear to that of the shaft as the gear is engaged the collar initially applies a force to a cone-shaped brass clutch attached to the gear, which brings the speeds to match prior to the collar locking into place. The collar is prevented from bridging the locking rings when the speeds are mismatched by synchro rings (also called blocker rings or baulk rings). The synchro ring rotates slightly due to the frictional torque from the cone clutch. In this position, the dog clutch is prevented from engaging. The brass clutch ring gradually causes parts to spin at the same speed. When they do spin the same speed, there is no more torque from the cone clutch and the dog clutch is allowed to fall into engagement. In a modern gearbox, the action of all of these components is so smooth and fast it is hardly noticed.\n\nThe modern cone system was developed by [[Porsche]] and introduced in the 1952 [[Porsche 356]]; cone synchronisers were called ''Porsche-type'' for many years after this. In the early 1950s, only the second-third shift was synchromesh in most vehicles, requiring only a single synchro and a simple linkage; drivers' manuals in vehicles suggested that if the driver needed to shift from second to first, it was best to come to a complete stop then shift into first and start up again. With continuing sophistication of mechanical development, fully synchromesh transmissions with three speeds, then four, and then five, became universal by the 1980s. Many modern manual-transmission vehicles, especially sports cars, now offer six speeds. The 2012 Porsche 911 offers a seven-speed manual transmission, with the seventh gear intended for cruising\u2014the top speed being attained on sixth.\n\nReverse gear is usually not synchromesh, as there is only one reverse gear in the normal automotive transmission and changing gears into reverse while moving is not required\u2014and often highly undesirable, particularly at high forward speed. Additionally, the usual method of providing reverse, with an idler gear sliding into place to bridge what would otherwise be two mismatched forward gears, is necessarily similar to the operation of a crash box. Among the vehicles that have synchromesh in reverse are the 1995\u20132000 Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique, '00\u2013'05 Chevrolet Cavalier, Mercedes 190 2.3-16, the V6 equipped [[Alfa Romeo GTV & Spider|Alfa Romeo GTV/Spider (916)]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alfisti.net/311.2.html?&L=1 |title=Buyers Guide Alfa Romeo Spider & GTV 916 |publisher=Alfisti.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> certain Chrysler, Jeep, and GM products which use the New Venture NV3500 and NV3550 units, the European Ford Sierra and Granada/Scorpio equipped with the [[Ford MT75 transmission|MT75]] gearbox, the Volvo 850, and almost all [[Lamborghini]]s, [[Honda]]s and [[BMW]]s.\n\n==Internals==\n[[File:ZF-16S181-transmission-hous.jpg|thumb|16-speed (2x4x2) [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] 16S181 \u2014 opened transmission housing ('''''2x4x'''''2)]]\n[[File:ZF-16S181-range.jpg|thumb|16S181 \u2014 opened [[Epicyclic gearing|planetary]] range housing (2x4'''''x2''''')]]\n===Shafts===\nA manual transmission has several shafts with various gears and other components attached to them. Most modern passenger cars use 'constant-mesh' transmissions consisting of three shafts: an ''input shaft'', a ''countershaft'' (also called a [[layshaft]]) and an ''output shaft''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bosch |first1=Robert |title=Automotive Handbook |date=2004 |publisher=Bentley Publishers |isbn=978-0-8376-0333-9 |page=741 |edition=6th |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=zsRHPwAACAAJ |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe ''input shaft'' is connected to the engine and spins at engine speed whenever the clutch is engaged.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Manual Transmissions Work |url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/transmission2.htm |website=www.howstuffworks.com |accessdate=13 March 2020 |language=en |date=1 April 2000}}</ref> The ''countershaft'' has gears of various sizes, which are permanently meshed with the corresponding gear on the input shaft.<ref>{{cite web |title=Basic Anatomy \u2013 How The Manual Transmission Works |url=https://www.gotodobbs.com/blog/how-manual-transmission-works/ |website=www.gotodobbs.com |accessdate=13 March 2020 |date=29 April 2017}}</ref> The gears on the ''output shaft'' are also permanently meshed with a corresponding gear on the countershaft, however the output shaft gears are able to rotate independently of the output shaft itself (through the use of bearings located between the gears and the shaft).<ref>{{cite web |title=How It Works: Manual transmissions |url=https://driving.ca/auto-news/news/how-it-works-manual-transmissions |website=www.driving.ca |accessdate=13 March 2020 |language=en |date=12 September 2018}}</ref> Through the use of [[Shaft collar|collars]] (operated using the ''shift rods''), the speed of the output shaft becomes temporarily locked to the speed of the selected gear.<ref>{{cite web |title=Manual Transmission Basics |url=https://www.edmunds.com/car-technology/manual-transmission-basics.html |website=www.edmunds.com |accessdate=13 March 2020 |language=en-us |date=25 April 2001}}</ref>\n\nWhen ''neutral'' is selected, none of the gears on the output shaft are locked to the shaft, allowing the input and output shafts to rotate independently. For reverse gear, an idler gear is used to reverse the direction in which the output shaft rotates. In many transmissions, the input and output shafts can be directly locked together (bypassing the counter shaft) to create a 1:1 gear ratio which is referred to as ''direct drive''.\n\nIn a transmission for [[longitudinal engine]]d vehicles (e.g. most rear-wheel drive cars), it is common for the input shaft and output shaft to be located on the same axis, since this reduces the [[torsion (mechanics)|torsional forces]] to which the transmission casing must withstand. The assembly consisting of both the input and output shafts is referred to as the ''mainshaft'' (although sometimes this term refers to just the input shaft or output shaft). Independent rotation of the input and output shafts is made possibly by one shaft being located inside the hollow bore of the other shaft, with a bearing located between the two shafts.\n\nIn a transmission for [[transverse engine]]d vehicles (e.g. front-wheel drive cars), there are usually only two shafts: input and countershaft (sometimes called input and output). The input shaft runs the whole length of the gearbox, and there is no separate input pinion. These transmissions also have an integral [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] unit, which is connected via a pinion gear at the end of the counter/output shaft.\n\n===Dog clutch===\n[[File:Selettore.jpg|thumb|Dog clutches. The gear-like teeth (\"dogs\", right-side images) engage and disengage with each other.]]\n\nAmong many different types of clutches, a dog clutch provides non-slip coupling of two rotating members. It is not suited to intentional slipping, in contrast with the foot-operated friction clutch of a manual-transmission vehicle.\n\nThe gear selector does not engage or disengage the actual gear teeth which are permanently meshed. Rather, the action of the gear selector is to lock one of the freely spinning gears to the shaft that runs through its hub. The shaft then spins together with that gear. The output shaft's speed relative to the countershaft is determined by the ratio of the two gears: the one permanently attached to the countershaft, and that gear's mate which is now locked to the output shaft.\n\nLocking the output shaft with a gear is achieved by means of a [[dog clutch]] selector. The dog clutch is a sliding selector mechanism which is splined to the output shaft, meaning that its hub has teeth that fit into slots (splines) on the shaft, forcing that shaft to rotate with it. However, the splines allow the selector to move back and forth on the shaft, which happens when it is pushed by a selector fork that is linked to the gear lever. The fork does not rotate, so it is attached to a collar bearing on the selector. The selector is typically symmetric: it slides between two gears and has a synchromesh and teeth on each side in order to lock either gear to the shaft.\n\n===Synchromesh===\n[[File:Sincronizzatore.jpg|thumb|Synchronizer rings]]\nSynchromesh transmission was invented in 1919 by [[Earl Avery Thompson]] and introduced by Cadillac in 1928.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hooniverse.com/synchromesh-gear-box-hows-that-work/|title=Synchromesh Gear Box- How's That Work?|author=|date=29 April 2014|work=hooniverse.com|accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref> If the dog teeth make contact with the gear, but the two parts are spinning at different speeds, the teeth will fail to engage and a loud grinding sound will be heard as they clatter together. For this reason, a modern dog clutch in an automobile has a synchronizer mechanism or ''synchromesh'', which consists of a [[cone clutch]] and blocking ring. Before the teeth can engage, the cone clutch engages first, which brings the selector and gear to the same speed using friction. Until synchronization occurs, the teeth are prevented from making contact, because further motion of the selector is prevented by a ''blocker'' (or ''baulk'') ring. When synchronization occurs, friction on the blocker ring is relieved and it twists slightly, bringing into alignment certain grooves or notches that allow further passage of the selector which brings the teeth together. The exact design of the synchronizer varies among manufacturers.\n\nThe synchronizer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/transmission3.htm|title=Synchronizers; graphic illustration of how they work|website=Howstuffworks.com|accessdate=2007-07-18|date=April 2000}}</ref> has to overcome the momentum of the entire input shaft and clutch disk when it is changing shaft rpm to match the new gear ratio. It can be abused by exposure to the momentum and power of the engine, which is what happens when attempts are made to select a gear without fully disengaging the clutch. This causes extra wear on the rings and sleeves, reducing their service life. When an experimenting driver tries to \"match the revs\" on a synchronized transmission and force it into gear without using the clutch, the synchronizer will make up for any discrepancy in RPM. The success in engaging the gear without clutching can deceive the driver into thinking that the RPM of the layshaft and transmission were actually exactly matched. Nevertheless, approximate rev. matching ''with [[double clutching]]'' can decrease the difference in rotational speed between the layshaft and transmission gear shaft, therefore decreasing synchro wear.\n\nSynchronizing rings are made of [[metal]] and can be provided with anti-wear coatings called a friction lining.\nCommon metals for synchronizer rings are [[brass]] and [[steel]]. The linings typically consist of [[molybdenum]], [[iron]], [[bronze]] or [[carbon]].\nThe synchronizing rings are produced either by massive forming ([[Forging|common forging]]) or sheet metal shaping. The latter involves the [[Metal stamping|stamping]] of the blank out of a [[Sheet metal|sheet metal strip]] and the subsequent machining with follow-on composite tools or transfer tools. A friction lining usually consists of thermally splashed molybdenum. Alternatively, [[iron]] or [[bronze]] [[Sintering|sinter]] friction layers can be used. [[Carbon]]-[[Coating|coated]] synchronizer rings are particularly [[wear]] resistant and offer very good friction behavior. Due to their higher price, these are reserved for high-performance transmissions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Diehl Metall Stiftung &amp; Co. KG |url=http://www.diehl.com/en/diehl-metall/products/synchronizer-rings.html |title=Synchronizer Rings: Diehl Metall |website=Diehl.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-06}}</ref>\n\nTransmissions with brass synchronizer components are generally not suitable for use with [[Gear oil|GL-5 specification oil]] unless specifically stated by the manufacturer as the extreme pressure (EP) additives in the oil are corrosive to brass and bronze components at high temperatures and decrease the synchronizer effectiveness at low temperatures. The additives in GL-5 oil also cause physical damage to brass synchronizers as the EP additives bond more strongly to the brass than the brass does to itself, causing a small layer of brass to be worn off with every gear change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widman.biz/uploads/Transaxle_oil.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Difference between GL-4 and GL-5 Gear Oils |author=Richard Widman |website=Widman.biz |accessdate=2017-03-06}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130413104023/http://www.caltex.com.au/FPL%20PDS/Thuban%20GL5%20EP.pdf]</ref> Instead, oil which meets only the GL-4 specification should be used whenever possible.\n\n===Reverse===\nThe previous discussion normally applies only to the forward gears. The implementation of the reverse gear is usually different, implemented in the following way to reduce the cost of the transmission. Reverse is also a pair of gears: one gear on the countershaft and one on the output shaft. However, whereas all the forward gears are always meshed together, there is a gap between the reverse gears. Moreover, they are both attached to their shafts: neither one rotates freely about the shaft. When reverse is selected a small gear, called an ''[[idler gear]]'' or ''reverse idler'', is slid between them. The idler has teeth which mesh with both gears, and thus it couples these gears together and reverses the direction of rotation without changing the gear ratio.\n\nIn other words, when reverse gear is selected, it is in fact ''actual'' gear teeth that are being meshed, with no aid from a synchronization mechanism. For this reason, the output shaft must not be rotating when reverse is selected: the vehicle must be stopped. In order that reverse can be selected without grinding even if the input shaft is spinning inertially, there may be a mechanism to stop the input shaft from spinning. The driver brings the vehicle to a stop, and selects reverse. As that selection is made, some mechanism in the transmission stops the input shaft. Both gears are stopped and the idler can be inserted between them. There is a clear description of such a mechanism in the [[Honda Civic]] 1996\u20131998 Service Manual, which refers to it as a \"noise reduction system\":\n\n{{quote|Whenever the [[automobile pedal|clutch pedal]] is depressed to shift into reverse, the mainshaft continues to rotate because of its inertia. The resulting speed difference between mainshaft and reverse idler gear produces gear noise [grinding]. The reverse gear noise reduction system employs a cam plate which was added to the reverse shift holder. When shifting into reverse, the 5th/reverse shift piece, connected to the shift lever, rotates the cam plate. This causes the 5th synchro set to stop the rotating mainshaft.|(13-4)}}\n\nA reverse gear implemented this way makes a loud whining sound, which is not normally heard in the forward gears. The teeth on the forward gears of most consumer automobiles are helically cut. When [[helical gear]]s rotate, there is constant contact between gears, which results in quiet operation. In spite of all forward gears being always meshed, they do not make a sound that can be easily heard above the engine noise. By contrast, most reverse gears are [[Spur gears|spur gear]]s, meaning that they have straight teeth, in order to allow for the sliding engagement of the idler, which is difficult with helical gears. The teeth of spur gears clatter together when the gears spin, generating a characteristic whine.\n\nAttempting to select reverse while the vehicle is moving forward causes severe gear wear (except in transmissions with synchromesh on the reverse gear). However, most manual transmissions have a gate that locks out reverse directly from 5th gear to help prevent this. In order to engage reverse from 5th, the shift lever has to be moved to the center position between 3rd and 4th, then back over and into reverse. Another widespread solution places reverse to the left of 1st gear, instead of behind the 5th (where one might expect to find a 6th gear). Many newer six-speed manual transmissions have a collar under the shift knob which must be lifted to engage reverse. Other reverse lockout designs include having to push the shift lever inward, toward the floor, to allow engagement of reverse, or requiring the driver to exert additional force to move the shift lever into reverse.\n\nThe spur gear design of reverse gear represents some compromises (less robust, unsynchronized engagement and loud noise) which are acceptable due to the relatively small amount of driving that takes place in reverse. The gearbox of the classic [[Saab 900|SAAB 900]] is a notable example of a gearbox with a helical reverse gear engaged in the same unsynchronized manner as the spur gears described above. Its design allows reverse to share cogs with first gear, and is exceptionally quiet, but results in difficult engagement and unreliable operation. However, many modern transmissions now include a reverse gear synchronizer and helical gearing, especially in applications which use three shafts as part of the transmission implementation instead of the conventional dual input and output shafts (usually to permit a shorter gearbox for the number of gears provided), since the third shaft inherently provides the option to reverse output rotation while still allowing permanently meshing gears.\n\n===Design variations===\n\n====Ratio count====\nUntil the mid-1950s (earlier in Europe and later in the US, on average) vehicles were generally equipped with 3-speed transmissions as standard equipment. 4-speed units began to appear on volume-production models in the 1930s (Europe) and 1950s (USA) and gained popularity in the 1960s; some exotics had 5-speeds. In the 1970s, as fuel prices rose and fuel economy became an important selling feature, 4-speed transmissions with an overdrive 4th gear or 5-speeds were offered in mass market automobiles and even compact pickup trucks, pioneered by [[Toyota]] (who advertised the fact by giving each model the suffix ''SR5'' as it acquired the fifth speed). 6-speed transmissions started to emerge in high-performance vehicles in the early 1990s. 7-speed transmissions appeared on extreme high-end supercars, such as the 2005 [[Bugatti Veyron]] (semi-automatic manual transmission). In 2012, the [[Porsche 911]] featured a 7-speed manual transmission, becoming the first of its class to support this feature, paving the way for the 2014 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C7)|Chevrolet Corvette Stingray]].\n\nToday, mass-market automotive manual transmissions are nearly all at least 5-speed. 4-speed manual transmissions had fallen into almost total disuse by the end of the 1980s, having gradually become less common on vehicles during the 1980s. By the early 1990s in the USA, they are usually only found on vehicles with engines of around 1\u20132 litres.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nIt has been widely anticipated that for electric vehicles (EVs), clutches and multi-speed gearboxes would not be required, as electric motors can drive the vehicle both forward and reverse from zero speed and typically operate over a wider speed range than combustion engines. Elimination of the gearbox represents a significant reduction in powertrain weight and complexity, and also removes a notable source of parasitic losses. The majority of first-generation consumer EVs have therefore been single-speed. However, current trends indicate that multi-speed gearboxes are likely to return for many future EVs. This allows the use of smaller, lower torque motors running at higher speeds to achieve both greater torque at the wheels for low speed tractive effort, and higher top road speed. Modest efficiency gains are also possible by reducing the proportion of the time that the motor(s) operate at very low speeds where efficiency is reduced. The wider speed range of motors means that the number of ratios required is lower than for combustion engine vehicles, with two to four speed designs emerging as the optimum depending on application.\n\nInitially the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]] was intended to have a purpose-built two-speed manual transmission,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/3528.html |title=2007 Tesla roadster |publisher=Supercars.net |date=2006-07-19 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref> but this gearbox proved to be problematic and was later replaced with a fixed-ratio transmission.\n\n====Gear ratios====\nThe slowest gears (designated '1' or low gear) in most automotive applications allow for three to four engine rotations for each output revolution (3:1). High, or \"top\", gear in many earlier three or four speed manual transmissions locks the output shaft to spin at the same speed as the engine (1:1). Five and six speed gearboxes are almost always 'overdrive' in top gear with the engine turning less than a full turn for each revolution of the output shaft, 0.8:1 for example (however, the final drive, or differential, always has further reduction gearing).\n\n====External overdrive====\n{{Main article|overdrive (mechanics)|l1=Overdrive}}\nIn the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, fuel-efficient highway cruising with low engine speed was in some cases enabled on vehicles equipped with 3- or 4-speed transmissions by means of a separate [[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] unit in or behind the rear housing of the transmission. This was actuated either manually while in high gear by throwing a switch or pressing a button on the gearstick knob or on the steering column, or automatically by momentarily lifting the foot from the accelerator with the vehicle travelling above a certain road speed. Automatic overdrives were disengaged by flooring the accelerator, and a lockout control was provided to enable the driver to disable overdrive and operate the transmission as a normal (non-overdrive) transmission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordification.com/tech/overdrive.htm |title=The Borg-Warner Overdrive Transmission Explained |publisher=FORDification.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-22}}</ref>\n\n====Shaft and gear configuration====\nOn a conventional rear-drive transmission, there are three basic shafts; the input, the output, and the countershaft. The input and output together are called the ''mainshaft'', since they are joined inside the transmission so they appear to be a single shaft, although they rotate totally independently of each other. The input shaft is much shorter than the output shaft. Parallel to the mainshaft is the countershaft. There are a number of gears fixed along the countershaft, and matching gears along the output shaft, although these are not fixed, and rotate independently of the output shaft. There are sliding ''dog collars'', or ''dog clutches'', between the gears on the output shaft, and to engage a gear to the shaft, the collar slides into the space between the shaft and the inside space of the gear, thus rotating the shaft as well. One collar is usually mounted between two gears, and slides both ways to engage one or the other gears, so on a four-speed there would be two collars. A front-drive transmission is basically the same, but may be simplified. There often are two shafts, the input and the output, but depending on the direction of rotation of the engine, three may be required. Rather than the input shaft driving the countershaft with a pinion gear, the input shaft takes over the countershaft's job, and the output shaft runs parallel to it. The gears are positioned and engaged just as they are on the countershaft and output shaft of a rear-drive. This merely eliminates one major component, the pinion gear. Part of the reason that the input and output are in-line on a rear drive unit is to relieve torsional stress on the transmission and mountings, but this is not an issue in a front-drive as the gearbox is integrated into the transaxle.\n\nThe basic process is not universal. The fixed and free gears can be mounted on either the input or output shaft, or both.\n\nThe distribution of the shifters is also a matter of design; it need not be the case that all of the free-rotating gears with selectors are on one shaft, and the permanently splined gears on the other. For instance a five-speed transmission might have the first-to-second selectors on the countershaft, but the third-to-fourth selector and the fifth selector on the mainshaft, which is the configuration in the 1998 [[Honda Civic]]. This means that when the vehicle is stopped and idling in neutral with the clutch engaged and the input shaft spinning, the third-, fourth-, and fifth-gear pairs do not rotate.\n\nIn some transmission designs (Volvo 850 and V/S70 series, for example) there are actually two countershafts, both driving an output pinion meshing with the front-wheel-drive transaxle's ring gear. This allows the transmission designer to make the transmission narrower, since each countershaft need only be half as long as a traditional countershaft with four gears and two shifters.\n\nOn some exotic sports cars and racing cars equipped with a double-clutch transmission, there are typically two input shafts and two countershafts, one for the odd numbered gears and one for the even numbered gears. This allows the next gear to be pre-engaged and selected by de-clutching one input shaft clutching the other. This results in no interruption of power driven through to the output shaft.\n\n====Freewheeling====\nSome automotive manual transmissions had [[freewheel]]ing capability in the 1930s through 1960s.\n\n==Clutch==\n{{Main article|Clutch#Vehicular|l1=Clutch}}\nIn all vehicles using a transmission (virtually all modern vehicles), a coupling device is used to separate the engine and transmission when necessary. This is because most internal-combustion engines must continue to run when in use, although a few modern vehicles shut off the engine [[start-stop system|when the vehicle is stationary]]. The [[clutch]] accomplishes this in manual transmissions. Without it, then other than when the transmission is in neutral, the engine and wheels would at all times be inextricably linked, and any time the vehicle stopped, the engine would stall. Without the clutch, changing gears would be very difficult, even with the vehicle moving already: deselecting a gear while the transmission is under load requires considerable force (and risks significant damage), but can still be done with much less force if the driver releases the accelerator just prior to attempting a shift as if there were no clutch disengaged. Selecting a gear requires the revolution speed of the engine to be held at a very precise value which depends on the vehicle speed and desired gear\u2013the speeds inside the transmission have to match. In a 4+-wheeled vehicle, the clutch is usually operated by a [[automobile pedal|pedal]]; on a motorcycle, a lever on the left handlebar serves the purpose.\n\n* When the clutch pedal is fully depressed, the clutch is fully disengaged, and no [[torque]] is transferred from the engine to the transmission (and by extension to the drive wheels). In this uncoupled state it is possible to select gears or to stop the vehicle without stopping the engine.\n* When the clutch pedal is fully released, the clutch is fully engaged and all of the engine's torque is transferred. In this coupled state, the clutch does not slip, but rather acts as rigid coupling to transmit power to the gearbox.\n* Between these extremes of engagement and disengagement the clutch slips to varying degrees. When slipping it still transmits torque despite the difference in speeds between the engine crankshaft and the transmission input. Because this torque is transmitted by means of friction rather than direct mechanical contact, considerable power is wasted as heat (which is dissipated by the clutch). Properly applied, slip allows the vehicle to be started from a standstill, and when it is already moving, allows the engine rotation to gradually adjust to a newly selected gear ratio.\n* Learning to use the clutch efficiently requires the development of [[muscle memory]] and a level of coordination.\n\nThe clutch is typically disengaged by a [[thrust bearing]] that makes contact with pressure petals on the clutch ring plate and pushes them inward to release the clutch pad friction. Normally the bearing remains retracted away from the petals and does not spin. However, the bearing can be \"burned out\" and damaged by using the clutch pedal as a foot rest, which causes the bearing to spin continuously from touching the clutch plates.\n\n=== Float shifting ===\n{{main article|Float shifting}}\nFloat shifting or floating gears is changing gears without depressing the clutch, usually on a non-synchronized transmission. Since the clutch is not used, it is easy to mismatch speeds of gears, and the driver can quickly cause major (and expensive) damage to the gears and the transmission. Float shifting is often done on large trucks with standard (non-synchronized) gearboxes.\n\n==Gear shift types==\n\n===Floor-mounted shifter===\n{{Main article|Gear stick}}\nIn most vehicles with manual transmission, gears are selected by manipulating a lever called a '''gear stick''', '''shift stick''', '''gearshift''', '''gear lever''', '''gear selector''', or '''shifter''' connected to the transmission via linkage or [[Bowden cable|cables]] and mounted on the floor, dashboard, or steering column. Moving the lever forward, backward, left, and right into specific positions selects particular gears.\n\nA sample layout of a four-speed transmission is shown below. '''N''' marks ''neutral'', the position wherein no gears are engaged and the engine is decoupled from the vehicle's drive wheels. The entire horizontal line is a neutral position, though the shifter is usually [[Spring (device)|spring-loaded]] so it will return to the centre of the N position if not moved to another gear. The '''R''' marks reverse, the gear position used for moving the vehicle backward.\n\n[[File:Manual Layout4d.svg|125px]]\n\nThis layout is called the '''shift pattern'''. Because of the shift quadrants, the basic arrangement is often called an ''H-pattern''. The shift pattern is usually molded or printed on or near the [[gear knob]].\n\nTypically, first gear is engaged at the top left position with second below, third up to the right with fourth, below, and so on. The only other pattern used in production vehicle manual transmissions is known as a [[dog-leg gearbox]] pattern. This pattern locates first at bottom left position, second up and to the right with third below, fourth up and to the right, and so on. This pattern is found primarily in race and race inspired vehicles. Placing the selection position for second gear above the position for third gear is desirable in racing as more frequent shifting occurs from second to third than from first to second.\n\nIndependent of the shift pattern, the location of the reverse gear may vary. Depending on the particular transmission design, reverse may be located at the upper left extent of the shift pattern, at the lower left, at the lower right, or at the upper right. There is often a mechanism that allows selection of reverse only from the neutral position, or a reverse lockout that must be released by depressing the spring-loaded gear knob or lifting a spring-loaded collar on the shift stick, to reduce the likelihood of the driver inadvertently selecting reverse.\n\n==== \"Three on the tree\" vs. \"four on the floor\" ====\nDuring the period when U.S. vehicles usually had only three forward speeds, the most common gear-shifter location was on the steering column, a layout that was sometimes called \"three on the tree\". By contrast, high-performance cars, and European vehicles in general, mostly used a four-speed transmission with floor-mounted shifters. That layout was referred to as \"four on the floor\".\n\nMost [[FR layout|FR (front-engined, rear-wheel drive)]] vehicles have a transmission that sits between the driver and the front passenger seat. Floor-mounted shifters are often connected directly to the transmission. [[FF layout|FF (front-engined, front-wheel drive)]] vehicles, [[RR layout|RR (rear-engined, rear-wheel drive)]] vehicles and front-engined vehicles with rear-mounted gearboxes often require a mechanical linkage to connect the shifter to the transmission.\n\n=== Column-mounted shifter ===\n<!-- [[Three on the tree]] links here -->\n[[File:SAAB96-interior.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Column mounted gear shift lever in a [[Saab 96]]]]\n\nSome vehicles have a gear lever mounted on the steering column. A 3-speed column shifter, which came to be popularly known as a \"three on the tree\", began appearing in America in the late 1930s and became common during the 1940s and 1950s. If a U.S. vehicle was equipped with [[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]], it was very likely to be a [[Borg-Warner]] type, operated by briefly backing off the accelerator  pedal when above {{convert|28|mph|abbr=on}} to enable, and momentarily flooring the same pedal to return to normal gear. The control simply disables overdrive for such situations as parking on a hill or preventing unwanted shifting into overdrive.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[File:Manual Layout 3.svg|125px]]\n\nLater,{{Vague|date=May 2011}} European and Japanese models began to have 4-speed column shifters with this shift pattern:\n\n[[File:Column4MT.svg|125px]]\n\nA majority of American-spec vehicles sold in the U.S. and Canada had a 3-speed column-mounted shifter\u2014the first generation Chevrolet/GMC vans of 1964\u201370 vintage had an ultra-rare 4-speed column shifter. The column-mounted manual shifter disappeared in North America by the mid-1980s, last appearing in the 1987 [[Chevrolet Scottsdale|Chevrolet pickup truck]]. Prior to 1980, the GM X platform compacts (Chevrolet Nova and its rebadged corporate clones) were the final passenger cars to have a column-mounted manual shifter. Outside North America, the column-mounted shifter remained in production. All [[Toyota Crown]] and [[Nissan Cedric]] [[taxicabs of Hong Kong|taxis in Hong Kong]] had the 4-speed column shift until 1999 when automatic transmissions were first offered. Since the late 1980s or early 1990s,{{Vague|date=May 2011}} a 5-speed column shifter has been offered in some vans sold in Asia and Europe, such as [[Toyota Hiace]], [[Mitsubishi Delica|Mitsubishi L400]] and the first-gen [[Fiat Ducato]].\n\nColumn shifters are mechanically similar to floor shifters, although shifting occurs in a vertical plane instead of a horizontal one. Because the shifter is further away from the transmission, and the movements at the shifter and at the transmission are in different planes, column shifters require more complicated [[linkage (mechanical)|linkage]] than floor shifters. Advantages of a column shifter are the ability to switch between the two most commonly used gears\u2014second and third\u2014without letting go of the steering wheel, and the lack of interference with passenger seating space in vehicles equipped with a [[bench seat]].\n\n===Console-mounted shifter===\nSome smaller cars in the 1950s and 1960s, such as [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]], [[Renault 4L]] and early [[Renault 5]] feature a shifter in the dash panel. This was cheaper to manufacture than a column shifter and more practical, as the gearbox was mounted in front of the engine. The linkage for the shifter could then be positioned on top of the engine. The disadvantage is that shifting is less comfortable and usually slower to operate.\n\nNewer small cars and [[minivan|MPV]]s, like the [[Suzuki MR Wagon]], the [[Fiat Multipla]], the [[Toyota Matrix]], the [[Pontiac Vibe]], the [[Chrysler RT platform]] cars, the [[Honda Element]], the [[Honda Civic]], the [[Daihatsu Ayla/Toyota Agya]], and the [[Honda Avancier]], may feature a manual or [[automatic transmission]] gear shifter located on the vehicle's instrument panel, similar to the mid-1950s [[PowerFlite|Chryslers]] and [[Powerglide]] [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]]s. Console-mounted shifters are similar to floor-mounted gear shifters in that most of the ones used in modern vehicles operate on a horizontal plane and can be mounted to the vehicle's transmission in much the same way a floor-mounted shifter can. However, because of the location of the gear shifter in comparison to the locations of the column shifter and the floor shifter, as well as the positioning of the shifter to the rest of the controls on the panel often require that the gearshift be mounted in a space that does not feature a lot of controls integral to the vehicle's operation, or frequently used controls, such as those for the [[car stereo|stereo system]] or [[car air conditioning|HVAC system]], to help prevent accidental activation or driver confusion, especially in [[right-hand drive]] vehicles.\n\nMore and more small cars and vans from manufacturers such as [[Suzuki]], [[Honda]], and [[Volkswagen]] are featuring console shifters in that they free up space on the floor for other features such as storage compartments without requiring that the gear shift be mounted on the steering column. Also, the basic location of the gear shift in comparison to the column shifter makes console shifters easier to operate than column shifters.\n\n===Sequential manual===\n{{Main article|Sequential manual transmission}}\nSome transmissions do not allow the driver to arbitrarily select any gear. Instead, the driver may only ever select the next-lower or next-higher gear ratio. Sequential transmissions often incorporate a synchro-less dog-clutch engagement mechanism (instead of the synchromesh dog clutch common on H-pattern automotive transmissions), in which case the clutch is only necessary when selecting first or reverse gear from neutral, and most gear changes can be performed without the clutch. However, sequential shifting and synchro-less engagement are not inherently linked, though they often occur together due to the environment(s) in which these transmissions are used, such as racing cars and motorcycles.\n\nSequential transmissions are generally controlled by a forward-backward lever, foot pedal, or set of paddles mounted behind the steering wheel. In some cases, these are connected mechanically to the transmission. In many modern examples, these controls are attached to sensors which instruct a transmission computer to perform a shift\u2014many of these systems can be switched into an automatic mode, where the computer controls the timing of shifts, much like an [[automatic transmission]].\n\n===In motorcycles===\nMotorcycles typically employ sequential transmissions, although the shift pattern is modified slightly for safety reasons. In a motorcycle the gears are usually shifted with the left foot pedal, the layout being this:\n[[File:2003 SV650S Gearshift.jpg|thumb|250px|The gear shift lever on a 2003 [[Suzuki SV650S]] motorcycle.]]\n\n'''1 - N - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 (- 6)'''\n\nThe pedal goes one step\u2013both up and down\u2013from the center, before it reaches its limit and has to be allowed to move back to the center position. Thus, changing multiple gears in one direction is accomplished by repeatedly pumping the pedal, either up or down. Although neutral is listed as being between first and second gears for this type of transmission, it \"feels\" more like first and second gear are just \"further away\" from each other than any other two sequential gears. Because this can lead to difficulty in finding neutral for inexperienced riders most motorcycles have a neutral indicator light on the instrument panel to help find neutral. The reason neutral does not actually have its own spot in the sequence is to make it quicker to shift from first to second when moving. Neutral can be accidentally shifted into, though most high end, newer model motorcycles have means of avoiding this.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The reason for having neutral between the first and second gears instead of at the bottom is that when stopped, the rider can just click down repeatedly and know that they will end up in first and not neutral. This allows riders to quickly move their bikes from a standstill in an emergency situation. This may also help on a steep hill on which high torque is required. It could be disadvantageous or even dangerous to attempt to be in first without realizing it, then try for a lower gear, only to get neutral.\n\nOn motorcycles used on race tracks, the shifting pattern is often reversed, that is, the rider clicks down to upshift. This usage pattern increases the [[ground clearance]] by placing the rider's foot above the shift lever when the rider is most likely to need it, namely when leaning over and exiting a tight turn.\n\nThe shift pattern for most [[underbone]] or [[Minibike|miniature]] motorcycles with an automatic [[centrifugal clutch]] is also modified for two key reasons\u2014to enable the less-experienced riders to shift the gears without problems of \"finding\" neutral, and also due to the greater force needed to \"lift\" the gearshift lever (because the gearshift pedal of an underbone motorcycle also operates the clutch). The gearshift lever of an underbone has two ends. The rider clicks down the front end with the left toe all the way to the top gear and clicks down the rear end with the heel all the way down to neutral, while miniatures still retain a single-end lever, with the rider clicks down to upshift and lift the lever up to downshift (or vice versa). Some underbone models such as the [[Honda Wave series|Honda Wave]] have a \"rotary\" shift pattern, which means that the rider can shift directly to neutral from the top gear, but for safety reasons this is only possible when the motorcycle is stationary. Some models also have gear position indicators for all gear positions at the instrument panel.\n\n===Automated manual===\nAlso called '''Automated-clutch manual'''. Some new transmissions ([[Alfa Romeo]]'s [[Selespeed]] gearbox, [[BMW]]'s ''Sequential Manual Gearbox'' (SMG) and [[Ferrari]]'s \"F1\" electrohydraulic automated gearbox, for example) are conventional manual transmissions with a computerized control mechanism. These transmissions feature independently selectable gears but do not have a physical [[clutch]] pedal. Instead, the transmission computer automates a [[Servomechanism|servo]] which [[wikt:disengage|disengage]]s the clutch when necessary.\n\nThese transmissions vary from a sequential manual transmission, in that they still allow nonsequential shifts: the \"SMG\" system formerly used by BMW, for example, could shift from 6th gear directly to 4th gear.\n\nAn early version of this type of transmission was the [[Autostick]], which was used in the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and [[Karmann Ghia]] from 1967 to 1976, where the clutch was disengaged by servo when the driver pushed downward slightly on the gear shift lever. This was a 3-speed unit.\n\nIn the case of the early [[Saab 900 (NG)|second generation Saab 900]], a 'Sensonic' option was available where gears were shifted with a conventional shifter, but the clutch is controlled by a computer.\n\nSee [[semi-automatic transmission|Automated manual transmission]] for more examples.\n\n===Short shifter===\n\n[[File:Shortshifter.jpg|thumb|Comparison between a stock shifter and a short shifter]]\n\nA '''short shifter''', also known as a '''short throw shifter''', is the result of an [[automotive aftermarket]] modification of the manual transmissions' stick shift either by modification of the existing stick shift or, alternately, by the replacement of the entire part.\n\nThe purpose of the modification is to mechanically reduce time between the changing of [[gear]]s while accelerating or decelerating, thus improving the automobiles' performance. The modification of the existing stick shift, also known as a manual [[gear stick]], can take two forms: either the physical shortening of the existing stick shift, known in the industry as 'chopping', or bending. By reducing the length of the stick shift, the distance it must travel to change gears is effectively reduced, thus reducing the time spent shifting. At the same time, the amount of force required to shift increases due to a shorter lever.\n\nSome major vehicle manufacturers such as [[Subaru]], [[Mazda]], and [[Porsche]] offer short shifters as stock modifications such as in the [[Subaru WRX]], [[Subaru WRX STI]], [[Subaru BRZ]], [[Mazda Miata]], and as an option such as in the [[Porsche 911]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091023041748/http://www.boston.com/cars/newsandreviews/overdrive/2009/10/2009_mazda_mx5_miata_more_tech.html] </ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.porsche.com/usa/accessoriesandservices/personalisation/tequipment/911-996/performance/n163/ |title=Short Shifter - Performance - Tequipment 911 (Type 996) - Dr. Ing. h.c.

Its system is made by [[Robert Bosch GmbH]]. Sometimes it is also referred as Electro-pneumatic gearbox or Finger control transmission (FCT).\n\nIn shift operations using mechanical link mechanisms in rear-engined buses, the FCT detected the position of the shift lever and converted it into an electronic signal. These signals were then used to perform transmission changes using air pressure. This resulted in easy shift changes and reduced driver fatigue, and also reduced the weight of the link mechanism. A pseudo-reaction force was added to the operation to reduce driver discomfort. Moreover, elaborate fail-safe mechanisms were incorporated, such as one that prevented mis-shifts, and one that assured safe driving in the event of system failure. The FCT was used in MP series heavy duty route buses from November 1983 after basic research and multiple prototypes and practical tests over 10 years. It gained popularity in combination with measures to assist older drivers, and in the following year, it was applied to large heavy duty tour buses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jsae.or.jp/autotech/data_e/8-5e.html|title=240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology - Finger control transmission (FCT)|author=|date=|work=jsae.or.jp|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Benefits==\n===Fuel economy===\nThe manual transmission couples the engine to the transmission with a rigid clutch instead of the [[torque converter]] on an automatic transmission or the v-belt of a continuously variable transmission,<ref>[http://staff.bath.ac.uk/enssa/thesis.pdf An Investigation into The Loss Mechanisms associated with a Pushing Metal V-Belt Continuously Variable Transmission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912055243/http://staff.bath.ac.uk/enssa/thesis.pdf |date=12 September 2005 }}, Sam Akehurst, 2001, PhD Thesis, University of Bath.</ref> which slip by nature. Manual transmissions also lack the parasitic power consumption of the automatic transmission's hydraulic pump. Also, manual transmissions do not require active cooling and because they are, mechanically, much simpler than automatic transmissions, they generally weigh less than comparable automatics, which can improve economy in stop-and-go traffic.<ref name=\"fueleconomy\"/>. Because of this, manual transmissions generally offer better [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] than automatic or continuously variable transmissions; however the disparity has been somewhat offset with the introduction of locking torque converters on automatic transmissions.<ref name=\"fueleconomy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov |title=U.S. Department of Energy vehicle fuel economy website |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> Increased fuel economy with a properly operated manual transmission vehicle versus an equivalent automatic transmission vehicle can range from 5% to about 15% depending on driving conditions and style of driving.<ref name=efficiency>[http://www.sae.org/servlets/productDetail?PROD_TYP=PAPER&PROD_CD=1999-01-1259 An Overview of Current Automatic, Manual and Continuously Variable Transmission Efficiencies and Their Projected Future Improvements], Kluger and Long, SAE 1999-01-1259</ref> The lack of [[#Performance and control|control]] over downshifting under load in an automatic transmission, coupled with a typical vehicle engine's greater efficiency under higher [[Brake specific fuel consumption#The use of BSFC numbers as operating values and as a cycle average statistic|load]], can enable additional fuel gains from a manual transmission by allowing the operator to keep the engine performing under a more efficient load/RPM combination. This is especially true as between manual and automatic versions of older models, as more recent advances including variable valve timing reduce the efficiency disadvantages of automatic transmissions by allowing better performance over a broader RPM range. In recognition of this, many current models (2010 and on) come with manual modes, or overrides on automatic models, although the degree of control varies greatly by the manufacturer.  However this gap in economy is being rapidly closed, and many mid- to higher-end model automatic vehicles now get better economy than their standard-spec counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} This is in part due to the increasing impact of computers co-ordinating multiple systems, particularly in hybrid models in which the engine and drive motors must be managed, as well as using more gears and more efficient gear ratios or different automatic technology such as CVTs and dual-clutch automatics.\n\n===Longevity===\nBecause manual transmissions are mechanically simpler, are more easily manufactured, and have fewer moving parts than automatic transmissions, they require less maintenance and are easier as well as cheaper to repair. Due to their mechanical simplicity, they often last longer than automatic transmissions when used by a skilled driver. Typically, there are no electrical components, pumps and cooling mechanisms in a manual transmission, other than an internal switch to activate reversing lighting. These attributes become extremely vital with a vehicle stuck in mud, snow, etc. The back and forth rocking motion of the vehicle drivers use to dislodge a stuck vehicle can destroy automatic transmissions. Clutches are a wear item that may need to be replaced at some point in the vehicle's lifespan, however the service life of the clutch depends on the operating conditions that it is subjected to.\n\n===Cost===\nThe price of a new vehicle with a manual transmission tends to be lower than the same vehicle with an automatic transmission.\n\nMost new vehicles are available with manual or automatic transmissions. There is often a difference in cost between the two. Manual transmissions generally cost less than automatic transmissions. For example, the base price of a [[Chevrolet]] Cruze 2LT with a manual transmission is $22,120, while the base price of the automatic is $23,405\u2014a difference of $1,285.\n\n===Lubrication===\nMost manual transmissions rely on [[Bearing (mechanical)#Splash lubrication|splash lubrication]] although some five speed Rover gearboxes did incorporate an oil pump. The problem with splash lubrication is that it is speed dependent. There are centrifugal effects, hydrodynamic effects and effects from the gears working as pumps. If a gearbox is fitted with Perspex windows and run on a test rig these effects can be observed. As the gearbox is run through its rev range, the oil jets will switch over and move around. Research on the Austin Maxi 1500 gearbox showed that one of the ball races was running dry at {{convert|80|mph|km/h}}. The solution was to alter the casting to include a small projection that would intercept the main oil jet that was present at 80&nbsp;mph and disperse it. This small modification enabled the later Maxi 1750 gearbox to be relatively trouble free. Four speed gearboxes seldom show these problems because at top speed (and maximum power) they are basically a solid shaft and the gears are not transmitting power.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Performance and control===\nManual transmissions have generally offered a wider selection of gear ratios. Many vehicles offer a 5-speed or 6-speed manual, whereas the automatic option would typically be a 4-speed. This is generally due to the increased space available inside a manual transmission compared with an automatic, since the latter requires extra components for self-shifting, such as torque converters and pumps. However, automatic transmissions are now adding more speeds as the technology matures. [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] currently manufactures 7- and 8-speed automatic transmissions. ZF is also planning a 9-speed automatic for use in front-wheel drive vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/mopar/transmissions/ZF9.html|title=ZF 9-Speed Automatic Transmission for Chrysler and Dodge cars|author=|date=|work=allpar.com|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref> The increased number of gears allows for better use of the engine's [[power band]], resulting in increased fuel economy by staying in the most fuel-efficient part of the power band, or higher performance, thereby remaining closer to the engine's peak power rating. Even with more forward speeds and the potential of designing more forward gears to offer higher speed and/or torque, the manual transmission remains smaller and much more compact than its larger, automatic cousin, as referenced by the [[Porsche 991|991 Generation of the Porsche 911]] and the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C7)|C7 Chevrolet Corvette]], which offer a 7-speed manual transmission.\n\n===Engine braking===\nIn contrast to most manual gearboxes, most automatic transmissions have far less effective engine-braking. This means that the engine does not slow the vehicle as effectively when the automatic transmission driver releases the engine speed control. This leads to more usage of the brakes in vehicles with automatic transmissions, bringing shorter brake life. Brakes are also more likely to overheat in hilly or mountainous areas, causing reduced braking ability, [[brake fade]], and the potential for complete failure with the automatic transmission vehicle.\n\n=== Push starting ===\nVehicles with a manual transmission can often be [[push start]]ed when the starter motor is not operational, usually due to a low battery.\n\nWhen push starting, the energy generated by the wheels moving on the road is transferred to the driveshaft, then the transmission and eventually the crankshaft. When the crankshaft spins as a result of the energy generated by the rolling of the vehicle, the motor is cranked over. This simulates what the starter is intended for and operates in a similar way to crank handles on very old cars from the early 20th century, with the cranking motion being replaced by the pushing of the car.\n\n==Drawbacks==\n===Complexity and learning curve===\nFor most people, there is a slight [[learning curve]] with a manual transmission, which may be intimidating and unappealing for a novice driver. Because the driver must develop a feel for properly engaging the clutch, an inexperienced driver will often release the clutch pedal abruptly, causing the engine to stall. Most drivers can learn how to drive a vehicle with a manual transmission in as little as an hour, although it may take weeks before it becomes \"second nature\". Additionally, if an inexperienced driver selects an inappropriate gear by mistake, damage to mechanical components and even loss of control can occur if not rectified quickly. \nLearning clutch/throttle pedal coordination can be made easier by using the clutch pedal ''only'', on a level surface. This will allow the operator to gauge where the \"sweet spot\" of clutch engagement is. \nCorrect \"release speed\" of the clutch pedal (''slow'' for smooth, ''fast'' for abrupt) will indicate when and where throttle pedal use should occur.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, such as the [[United Kingdom]], a driving licence issued for only vehicles with an automatic transmission is not valid for driving vehicles with a manual transmission, but a licence for manual transmissions covers both.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/driving-licence-categories|title=Driving licence categories - GOV.UK|author=|date=|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref> This is also the case for P1 (provisional-1) car licence holders in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], but P2 (provisional-2) licence holders are allowed to drive vehicles with either transmission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/stayingsafe/drivers/youngdrivers/licence-conditions/index.html|author=NSW|title=Licence conditions - Younger drivers - Drivers - Staying safe - NSW Centre for Road Safety|date=2014-11-10}}</ref>\n\n===Shifting speed===\nAutomatic transmissions can typically shift ratios faster than a manual gear change can be accomplished, due to the time required for the average driver to push the clutch pedal to the floor and move the gearstick from one position to another. This is especially true in regards to [[dual-clutch transmission]]s, which are specialized computer-controlled automatic transmissions that mechanically operate more like a manual transmission than a traditional automatic one.\n\n===Ease of use===\nBecause manual transmissions require the operation of an extra pedal, and keeping the vehicle in the correct gear at all times, they require more concentration, especially in heavy traffic situations. The automatic transmissions, on the other hand, simply require the driver to speed up or slow down as needed, with the vehicle doing the work of choosing an appropriate gear. Manual transmissions also place a greater workload on the driver in heavy traffic situations, when the driver must operate the clutch pedal quite often. Because the clutch pedal can require a substantial amount of force, especially on large trucks, and the long pedal travel compared to the brake or accelerator requires moving the entire leg, not just the foot near the ankle, a manual transmission can cause fatigue, and is more difficult for injured people to drive. Additionally, because automatic transmissions can be driven with only one foot, people with one leg that is missing or impaired can still drive, unlike the manual transmission that requires the use of two feet at once. Likewise, manual transmissions require the driver to remove one hand periodically from the steering wheel while the vehicle is in motion, which can be difficult or impossible to do safely for people with a missing or impaired arm, and requires increased coordination, even for those with full use of both hands.\n\n===Stopping on hills===\nThe clutch experiences most of its wear in first gear because moving the vehicle from a standstill involves a great deal of friction at the clutch. When accelerating from a standstill on an incline, this problem is made worse because the amount of work needed to overcome the acceleration of gravity causes the clutch to heat up considerably more. For this reason, stop-and-go driving and hills tend to have an effect on the clutches to a certain degree.\nAutomatic transmissions are better suited for these applications because they have a hydraulic torque converter which is externally cooled, unlike a clutch. Torque converters also do not have a friction material that rubs off over time like a clutch. Some automatics even lock the output shaft so that the vehicle cannot roll backwards when beginning to accelerate up an incline. To reduce wear in these applications, some manual transmissions will have a very low, \"granny\" gear which provides the leverage to move the vehicle easily at very low speeds. This reduces wear at the clutch because the transmission requires less input torque. However, the issue of ''handling stops on hills'' is easy to learn.\n\nMany drivers use the parking brake to prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards when starting to accelerate up a steep hill. This saves precious clutch life. A device called the [[hill-holder]] was introduced on the 1936 Studebaker. Some modern manual vehicles such as the [[Dodge Challenger]] and most [[Subaru]] models have a \"[[hill-start assist]]\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Lampton |first=Christopher |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/car-driving-safety/safety-regulatory-devices/hill-start-control.htm |title=How Hill-Start Control Works &#124; HowStuffWorks |website=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2009-10-05 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}</ref> feature. The vehicle's computer applies just enough brake pressure to prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards. This allows the driver to start normally with no additional effort, even on steep hills.\n\nStarting on a hill with the aid of the parking brake is not always possible since in recent vehicles that feature an [[electric park brake]] the parking brake can only be released when the brake pedal is engaged.\n\n==Applications and popularity==\nSports cars are also often equipped with manual transmissions because they offer more direct driver involvement and better performance, though this is changing as many automakers move to faster dual-clutch transmissions, which are generally shifted with paddles located behind the steering wheel. For example, the 991 [[Porsche 911 GT3]] uses Porsche's PDK. Off-road vehicles and trucks often feature manual transmissions because they allow direct gear selection and are often more rugged than their automatic counterparts.\n\nConversely, manual transmissions are no longer popular in many classes of vehicles sold in North America, Australia, and some parts of Asia, although they remain dominant in other parts of Asia, and in Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Nearly all vehicles are available with an automatic transmission option, and family vehicles and large pickup trucks sold in the US are predominantly fitted with automatics. However, in some cases, if a buyer wishes, they can have the vehicle fitted with a manual transmission at the factory. In Europe, most vehicles are sold with manual transmissions. Most luxury vehicles are only available with an automatic transmission. In most cases where both transmissions are available for a given model of vehicle, automatics are an at-cost option, but in some cases the reverse is true. Some vehicles, such as [[rental car|rental]]s and [[taxicab]]s, are nearly universally equipped with automatic transmissions in countries such as the [[United States]], but the opposite is true in [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ricksteves.com/plan/tips/carrental_2005.htm |title=Rick Steve's Europe: Driving in Europe |publisher=Ricksteves.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> As of 2008, 75.2% of vehicles made in Western Europe were equipped with manual transmission, versus 16.1% with automatic and 8.7% with other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dctfacts.com/archive/2008/why-dual-clutch-technology-big-business.aspx |title=Why Dual Clutch Technology Will Be Big Business |publisher=Dctfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref>\n\nWhen a driver passes their driving test using a vehicle with an [[automatic transmission]], in some jurisdictions; the resulting driving licence is restricted to the use of vehicles with automatic transmissions only. This is the case in countries such as [[New Zealand]] (for the second-phase Restricted license, but not the final Full license), the [[European Union]] with the exception of member countries that opt to disallow road tests on automatic vehicles completely, [[China]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Norway]], [[Philippines]], [[Russia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]], [[South Korea]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United Arab Emirates|U.A.E]]. This treatment of the manual transmission skill seems to maintain the widespread use of the manual transmission.{{citation_needed|date=February 2019}} As many new drivers worry that their restricted license will become an obstacle for them where most vehicles have manual transmissions, they make the effort to learn with manual transmissions and obtain full licenses. Some other countries (such as [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Portugal]], [[Malaysia]], [[Serbia]], [[Brazil]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Denmark]]) go even further, whereby the license is granted only when a test is passed on a manual transmission. In Denmark and Brazil, drivers are allowed to sit the test in an automatic vehicle if they are disabled, but with such a license they will not be allowed to drive a vehicle with a manual transmission.\n\n==Truck transmissions==\nSome trucks have transmissions that look and behave like ordinary consumer vehicle transmissions\u2014these transmissions are used on lighter trucks, typically have up to 6 gears, and usually have [[manual transmission#Unsynchronized transmission|synchromesh]].\n\nFor trucks needing more gears, the standard \"H\" pattern can get very complicated, so additional controls are used to select additional gears. The \"H\" pattern is retained, then an additional control selects among alternatives. In older trucks, the control is often a separate lever mounted on the floor or more recently a pneumatic switch mounted on the \"H\" lever; in newer trucks the control is often an electrical switch mounted on the \"H\" lever. Multi-control transmissions are built in much higher power ratings, but rarely use synchromesh.\n\nThere are several common alternatives for the shifting pattern. Usual types are:\n\n*'''Range transmissions''' use an \"H\" pattern through a narrow range of gears, then a \"range\" control shifts the \"H\" pattern between high and low ranges. For example, an 8-speed range transmission has an H shift pattern with four gears. The first through fourth gears are accessed when low range is selected. To access the fifth through eighth gears, the range selector is moved to high range, and the gear lever again shifted through the first through fourth gear positions. In high range, the first gear position becomes fifth, the second gear position becomes sixth, and so on.\n*'''Splitter transmissions''' use an \"H\" pattern with a wide range of gears, and the other selector splits each sequential gear position in two: First gear is in first position/low split, second gear is in first position/high split, third gear is in second position/low split, fourth gear is in second position/high split, and so on.\n*'''Range-Splitter transmissions''' combine range-splitting and gear-splitting. This allows even more gear ratios. Both a range selector and a splitter selector are provided.\n\nAlthough there are many gear positions, shifting through gears usually follows a regular pattern. For example, a series of upshifts might use \"move to splitter direct; move to splitter overdrive; move shift lever to No.&nbsp;2 and move splitter to underdrive; move splitter to direct; move splitter to overdrive; move shift lever to No.&nbsp;3 and move splitter to underdrive\"; and so on. In older trucks using floor-mounted levers, a bigger problem is common gear shifts require the drivers to move their hands between shift levers in a single shift, and without synchromesh, shifts must be carefully timed or the transmission will not engage. For this reason, some splitter transmissions have an additional \"under under\" range, so when the splitter is already in \"under\" it can be quickly downshifted again, without the delay of a double shift.\n\nToday's truck transmissions are most commonly \"range-splitter\". The most common 13-speed has a standard H pattern, and the pattern from left upper corner is as follows: R, down to L, over and up to 1, down to 2, up and over to 3, down to 4. The \"butterfly\" range lever in the center front of the knob is flipped up to high range while in 4th, then shifted back to 1. The 1 through 4 positions of the knob are repeated. Also, each can be split using the thumb-actuated under-overdrive lever on the left side of the knob while in high range. The \"thumb\" lever is not available in low range, except in 18 speeds; 1 through 4 in low range can be split using the thumb lever and L can be split with the \"Butterfly\" lever. L cannot be split using the thumb lever in either the 13- or 18-speed. The 9-speed transmission is basically a 13-speed without the under-overdrive thumb lever.\n\nTruck transmissions use many physical layouts. For example, the output of an N-speed transmission may drive an M-speed secondary transmission, giving a total of N*M gear combinations; for example a 4-speed main box and 3-speed splitter gives 12 ratios. Transmissions may be in separate cases with a shaft in between; in separate cases bolted together; or all in one case, using the same lubricating oil. The second transmission is often called a \"Brownie\" or \"Brownie box\" after a popular brand. With a third transmission, gears are multiplied yet again, giving greater range or closer spacing. Some trucks thus have dozens of gear positions, although most are duplicates. Sometimes a secondary transmission is integrated with the differential in the rear axle, called a \"two-speed rear end\". Two-speed differentials are always splitters. In newer transmissions, there may be two countershafts, so each main shaft gear can be driven from one or the other countershaft; this allows construction with short and robust countershafts, while still allowing many gear combinations inside a single gear case.\n\nHeavy-duty transmissions are almost always [[Non-synchronous transmission|non-synchromesh]]. One argument is synchromesh adds weight that could be payload, is one more thing to fail, and drivers spend thousands of hours driving so can take the time to learn to drive efficiently with a non-synchromesh transmission. Heavy-duty trucks driven frequently in city traffic, such as cement mixers, need to be shifted very often and in stop-and-go traffic. Since few heavy-duty transmissions have synchromesh, [[automatic transmission]]s are commonly used instead, despite their increased weight, cost, and loss of efficiency.\n\nHeavy trucks are usually powered with [[diesel engine]]s. Diesel truck engines from the 1970s and earlier tend to have a narrow power band, so need many close-spaced gears. Starting with the 1968 [[Mack Trucks#Maxidyne engine|Maxidyne]], diesel truck engines have increasingly used turbochargers and electronic controls that widen the power band, allowing fewer and fewer gear ratios. A transmission with fewer ratios is lighter and may be more efficient due to fewer transmissions in series. Fewer shifts also makes the truck more drivable. As of 2005, fleet operators often use 9, 10, 13 or 18-speed transmissions, but automated manual and semi-automatic transmissions are becoming more common on heavy vehicles, as they can improve efficiency and drivability, reduce the barrier to entry for new drivers, and may improve safety by allowing the driver to concentrate on road conditions. {{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Crash gearbox==\n[[File:Three-speed crash gearbox, schematic (Autocar Handbook, 13th ed, 1935).jpg|right|thumb|Diagram showing a three-speed gearbox. First, Second and Reverse gears are 'crash' engagement, while third is direct drive. The constant-mesh gears drive the layshaft for first, second, and reverse.]]\nA '''crash gearbox''', also known as a '''crash box''', is a [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] type used in old cars, trucks, and other automotive vehicles. It is more properly called a \"sliding mesh\" gearbox and has the nickname \"crash\" because it is difficult to change gears, so gear changes are often accompanied by loud noises. The etymology of \"crash\" is probably \"clash\".\n\nIn a sliding-mesh gearbox, individual gears are mounted so they always engage the shaft, but gears on one shaft can be moved axially. To engage a particular pair of gears, one gear is slid axially until it fully engages a gear on the other shaft. If the gear shafts are spinning so the two gears have the same surface speed, the gears are relatively easy to engage. However, if speeds are mismatched, the gears tend to \"bounce\" off each other at first contact and resist engagement. Thus, gear engagement relies on the driver carefully matching speeds, typically through practice and intuition.\n\nIn contrast, newer \"constant mesh\" transmissions use gears that are held axially, but gears on one shaft spin freely on the shaft. Gear pairs in the transmission are always in mesh, though at most one is engaged at any time. Each free-spinning gear has a [[dog clutch]] which is engaged by an axial sliding collar that transfers power to the shaft. The dog clutch may be plain, also called \"non-synchromesh\", or may use an additional [[Synchromesh gearbox|synchromesh]] mechanism that helps get the parts moving at the same speed to assist engagement. Many constant mesh transmissions use a sliding-mesh gear for reverse, but since reverse is only engaged from near a stop, it is still easy to engage.\n\nA constant-mesh transmission offers several advantages over a sliding-mesh design. First, the dog clutch is designed for the task, rather than asking the gear to do dual duty of power transmission and sliding engagement. Second, any shock from engagement of the dog clutch is spread out among many teeth rather than just one or two teeth on the gears themselves. This greatly reduces the resulting stress when gears are engaged. Third, the dog clutch is typically smaller in diameter than the gear it controls, so absolute speeds of the engaging parts are lower, aiding engagement. Thus, while a non-synchromesh transmission still relies on the operator to match speeds, gears are easier to engage. Fourth, a constant-mesh transmission can easily use [[Gear#Helical gears|helical gears]] which are smoother, quieter, and can carry more torque for a given size of gear. Fifth, a constant-mesh transmission can use synchromesh for easier shifting; while many heavy vehicle transmissions do not use it, most medium- and light-duty automotive transmissions do.\n\n==Maintenance==\nBecause clutches use changes in [[friction]] to modulate the transfer of torque between engine and transmission, they are subject to wear in everyday use. A very good clutch, when used by an expert driver, can last hundreds of thousands of kilometres (or miles). Weak clutches, abrupt downshifting, inexperienced drivers, and aggressive driving can lead to more frequent repair or replacement. Other factors that can lead to excessive clutch wear include increased urban driving (since the clutch is used more for a given distance travelled) and excessively tall gearing (which requires more slippage of the clutch to start from a standing stop).\n\nManual transmissions are lubricated with gear oil or engine oil in some vehicles, which must be changed periodically in some vehicles, although not as frequently as the fluid in an automatic transmission. Some manufacturers specify that changing the gear oil is never necessary except after transmission work or to rectify a leak. However, manual transmission oil is usually not filtered and accumulates metal particles from normal wear. Also, manual transmission oil has additives (such as friction modifiers to improve synchro function) which lose effectiveness with time. For these reasons, it is best to periodically change transmission oil, even on vehicles which specify a \u2018lifetime fill\u2019.\n\nGear oil has a characteristic aroma due to the addition of sulfur-bearing anti-wear compounds. These compounds are used to reduce the high [[sliding friction]] by the [[helical gear]] cut of the teeth (this cut eliminates the characteristic whine of straight cut [[spur gear]]s). On motorcycles with \"wet\" clutches (clutch is bathed in engine oil), there is usually nothing separating the lower part of the engine from the transmission, so the same oil lubricates both the engine and transmission. The original [[Mini]] placed the gearbox in the oil sump below the engine, thus using the same oil for both. The clutch was however a fairly conventional dry plate clutch.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"175px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:Manual transmission clutch Reverse gear.PNG|Reverse (green engaged)\nImage:Manual transmission clutch Neutral.PNG|Neutral (blue and purple in the middle, green disengaged)\nImage:Manual transmission clutch First gear.PNG|First gear (blue, to back)\nImage:Manual transmission clutch Second gear.PNG|Second gear (blue, to front)\nImage:Manual transmission clutch Third gear.PNG|Third gear (purple, to back)\nImage:Manual transmission clutch Fourth gear.PNG|Fourth gear (purple, to front)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons}}\n*[[Automatic transmission]]\n*[[Diesel\u2013electric transmission]]\n*[[Freewheel]]\n*[[Gear train]]\n*[[Torque converter|Hydraulic transmission]]\n*[[Transmission (mechanics)]]\n*[[Non-synchronous transmission]]\n*[[Overdrive (mechanics)|Overdrive]]\n*[[Preselector gearbox]]\n*[[Ford Toploader transmission]]\n**[[Borg-Warner T-56 transmission]]\n**[[G56 manual transmission]]\n**[[New Venture Gear 5600 transmission]]\n**[[New Venture Gear 4500 transmission]]\n**[[New Venture Gear 3500 transmission]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Powertrain}}\n{{Gears}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Manual Transmission}}\n[[Category:Automotive transmission technologies]]\n[[Category:Automobile transmissions]]\n", "name_user": "Davism0703", "label": "safe", "comment": "The \"manual\" feature in many torque converter automatic transmissions remains unrelated to sequential transmissions, the later of which has a clutch.

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. The vitamin exists as a family of [[vitamer]]s defined as a number of chemical compounds having a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system. [[Adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body, the first in mitochondria and the second in cell cytosol. AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location.\n\n[[Cyanocobalamin]] is a manufactured form with a cyano ([[cyanide]]) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

The [[hydrogenase]]s and, by necessity, enzymes associated with cobalt utilization, involve metal-carbon bonds.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bioorganometallics: Biomolecules, Labeling, Medicine | veditors = Jaouen G | url = https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Bioorganometallics%3A+Biomolecules%2C+Labeling%2C+Medicine-p-9783527309900 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-527-30990-0}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is a generic descriptor name referring to a collection of [[cobalt]] and [[corrin ring]] molecules, which are defined by their particular vitamin function in the body. All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. After this synthesis is complete, the human body has the ability to convert cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin to an active form, by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms. The structure of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, which forms the R group of adensoylcobalamin is also shown.]]\n\n===Vitamers===\nThe four vitamers of B<sub>12</sub> (see figure) are all deeply red-colored crystals due to the color of the cobalt-corrin complex.\n\n*'''[[Cyanocobalamin]]''' is one form of B<sub>12</sub> because it can be metabolized in the body to an active [[coenzyme]] form.<ref name=lpi/> The cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> does not occur in nature normally, but is a byproduct of the fact that other forms of B<sub>12</sub> are avid binders of cyanide (\u2013CN) which they pick up in the process of [[activated charcoal]] purification of the vitamin after it is made by bacteria in the commercial process. Since the cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B<sub>12</sub> for food fortification, in many common multivitamins and as a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> dietary supplement. \n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology, but is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. This is the form of B<sub>12</sub> produced by bacteria, and which is converted to cyanocobalamin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for [[cyanide]] ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) and '''[[methylcobalamin]]''' (MeB<sub>12</sub> or MeCbl) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body. Most of the body's reserves are stored as adoB<sub>12</sub> in the liver. This is converted to the methylcobalamin form as needed.\n\nA review of what is reported in the literature about cobalamin chemistry, transport, and processing suggests that there is unlikely to be any advantage to the use of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin for treatment of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency over using cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin except possibly in very rare circumstances in which an inborn metabolic disorder reduces the efficiency of the conversion of cyanocobalamin to MeCbl or AdoCbl. The use of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin has been suggested in these cases. For the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is the required form. Due to its excellent shelf-life and stability, cyanocobalamin is still considered the best choice for oral administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeid R, Fedosov SN, Nexo E | title = Cobalamin coenzyme forms are not likely to be superior to cyano- and hydroxyl-cobalamin in prevention or treatment of cobalamin deficiency | journal = Molecular Nutrition & Food Research | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1364\u201372 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25820384 | pmc = 4692085 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201500019 }}</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[File:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|300px|[[Metabolism]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is seen at bottom left.]]\n\n===Coenzyme function===\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> functions as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee R, Ragsdale SW | title = The many faces of vitamin B12: catalysis by cobalamin-dependent enzymes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | pages = 209\u201347 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 14527323 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161828 }}</ref> Three types of enzymes:\n\n# [[Isomerase]]s\n#: Rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

Unfortunately, an elevated MMA is a [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive but not specific test]], and not all who have it actually have B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. For example, while MMA is elevated in 90\u201398% of patients with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency; 20\u201325% of patients over the age of 70 have elevated levels of MMA, yet 25\u201333% of them do not have B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. For this reason, assessment of MMA levels is not routinely recommended in the elderly. There is no \"gold standard\" test for B<sub>12</sub> deficiency because as a B<sub>12</sub> deficiency occurs, serum values may be maintained while tissue B<sub>12</sub> stores become depleted. Therefore, serum B<sub>12</sub> values above the cut-off point of deficiency do not necessarily indicate adequate B<sub>12</sub> status.

[[Tetrahydrofolate|THF]] may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B<sub>12</sub> and infantile [[megaloblastic anemia]], and abnormal B<sub>12</sub> related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B<sub>12</sub> levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]].

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. The vitamin exists as a family of [[vitamer]]s defined as a number of chemical compounds having a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system. [[Adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body, the first in mitochondria and the second in cell cytosol. AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location.\n\n[[Cyanocobalamin]] is a manufactured form with a cyano ([[cyanide]]) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.

The sixth coordination site, the [[reactive center]], is variable, being a [[Cyanide|cyano group]] (\u2013CN), a [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2013OH), a [[methyl]] group (\u2013CH<sub>3</sub>) or a 5\u2032-deoxy[[Adenosine|adenosyl]] group (here the C5\u2032 atom of the deoxyribose forms the [[organocobalt chemistry|covalent bond with cobalt]] respectively, to yield the four [[vitamer]]s (forms) of B<sub>12</sub>). Historically, the covalent C-Co bond is one of the first examples of carbon-metal bonds to be discovered in biology.

All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. After this synthesis is complete, the human body has the ability to convert cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin to an active form, by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms. The structure of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, which forms the R group of adensoylcobalamin is also shown.]]\n\n===Vitamers===\nThe four vitamers of B<sub>12</sub> (see figure) are all deeply red-colored crystals due to the color of the cobalt-corrin complex.\n\n*'''[[Cyanocobalamin]]''' is one form of B<sub>12</sub> because it can be metabolized in the body to an active [[coenzyme]] form.<ref name=lpi/> The cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> does not occur in nature normally, but is a byproduct of the fact that other forms of B<sub>12</sub> are avid binders of cyanide (\u2013CN) which they pick up in the process of [[activated charcoal]] purification of the vitamin after it is made by bacteria in the commercial process. Since the cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B<sub>12</sub> for food fortification, in many common multivitamins and as a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> dietary supplement. \n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology, but is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. This is the form of B<sub>12</sub> produced by bacteria, and which is converted to cyanocobalamin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for [[cyanide]] ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) and '''[[methylcobalamin]]''' (MeB<sub>12</sub> or MeCbl) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body. Most of the body's reserves are stored as adoB<sub>12</sub> in the liver. This is converted to the methylcobalamin form as needed.\n\nA review of what is reported in the literature about cobalamin chemistry, transport, and processing suggests that there is unlikely to be any advantage to the use of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin for treatment of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency over using cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin except possibly in very rare circumstances in which an inborn metabolic disorder reduces the efficiency of the conversion of cyanocobalamin to MeCbl or AdoCbl. The use of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin has been suggested in these cases. For the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is the required form. Due to its excellent shelf-life and stability, cyanocobalamin is still considered the best choice for oral administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeid R, Fedosov SN, Nexo E | title = Cobalamin coenzyme forms are not likely to be superior to cyano- and hydroxyl-cobalamin in prevention or treatment of cobalamin deficiency | journal = Molecular Nutrition & Food Research | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1364\u201372 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25820384 | pmc = 4692085 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201500019 }}</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[File:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|300px|[[Metabolism]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is seen at bottom left.]]\n\n===Coenzyme function===\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> functions as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee R, Ragsdale SW | title = The many faces of vitamin B12: catalysis by cobalamin-dependent enzymes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | pages = 209\u201347 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 14527323 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161828 }}</ref> Three types of enzymes:\n\n# [[Isomerase]]s\n#: Rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

Unfortunately, an elevated MMA is a [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive but not specific test]], and not all who have it actually have B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. For example, MMA is elevated in 90\u201398% of patients with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency; 20\u201325% of patients over the age of 70 have elevated levels of MMA, yet 25\u201333% of them do not have B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. For this reason, assessment of MMA levels is not routinely recommended in the elderly. There is no \"gold standard\" test for B<sub>12</sub> deficiency because as a B<sub>12</sub> deficiency occurs, serum values may be maintained while tissue B<sub>12</sub> stores become depleted. Therefore, serum B<sub>12</sub> values above the cut-off point of deficiency do not necessarily indicate adequate B<sub>12</sub> status. The MUT function is necessary for proper [[myelin]] synthesis and is not affected by folate supplementation.\n# [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]], also known as methionine synthase, is a methyltransferase enzyme, which uses the MeB<sub>12</sub> and reaction type 2 to transfer a methyl group from [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate]] to [[homocysteine]], thereby generating [[tetrahydrofolate]] (THF) and [[methionine]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee RV, Matthews RG | title = Cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 1450\u20139 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 2407589 | doi = 10.1096/fasebj.4.5.2407589 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/72f397b529d457977a9e949dbfb325eebe124590 }}</ref> This functionality is lost in [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]], resulting in an increased [[homocysteine]] level and the trapping of [[folate]] as 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, from which THF (the active form of folate) cannot be recovered. THF plays an important role in DNA synthesis so reduced availability of THF results in ineffective production of cells with rapid turnover, in particular red blood cells, and also intestinal wall cells which are responsible for absorption. [[Tetrahydrofolate|THF]] may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B<sub>12</sub> and infantile [[megaloblastic anemia]], and abnormal B<sub>12</sub> related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B<sub>12</sub> levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]]. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a [[lysosome]], and free B<sub>12</sub> is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Awami HM, Raja A, Soos MP |title=Physiology, Intrinsic Factor (Gastric Intrinsic Factor) |journal=StatPearls [Internet] |volume= |issue= |pages= |date= August 2019 |pmid=31536261 |doi= |url=}}</ref>\n\nInvestigations into the intestinal absorption of B<sub>12</sub> point out that the upper limit of absorption per single oral dose, under normal conditions, is about 1.5{{nbsp}}\u00b5g.

The total amount of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> stored in body is about 2\u20135{{nbsp}}mg in adults. Around 50% of this is stored in the liver. Approximately 0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed. [[Bile]] is the main form of B<sub>12</sub> excretion; most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in the bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine. Owing to the extremely efficient enterohepatic circulation of B<sub>12</sub>, the liver can store 3 to 5 years' worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; therefore, nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is rare in adults in the absence of malabsorption disorders.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\n==Production==\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Cobalamin biosynthesis}}\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is derived from a [[tetrapyrrole|tetrapyrrolic structural framework]] created by the enzymes [[Porphobilinogen deaminase|deaminase]] and [[uroporphyrinogen III synthase|cosynthetase]] which transform [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[porphobilinogen]] and [[hydroxymethylbilane]] to [[uroporphyrinogen III]].

However, it is not clear how these numbers were calculated or whether they disaggregate civilian and soldier deaths. Others' attempts to verify the numbers suggest a lower number. Demographer Patrick Heuveline has produced evidence suggesting a range of 150,000 to 300,000 violent deaths from 1970 to 1975. In an article reviewing different sources about civilian deaths during the civil war, Bruce Sharp argues that the total number is likely to be around 250,000 violent deaths.&nbsp;... [Heuveline]'s conclusion is that an average of 2.52 million people (range of 1.17\u20133.42 million) died as a result of regime actions between 1970 and 1979, with an average estimate of 1.4 million (range of 1.09\u20132.16 million) directly violent deaths.}}</ref><ref name=\"Banister, Judith 1993\">{{cite book|last1=Banister|first1=Judith|last2=Johnson|first2=E.

North Vietnam's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) involvement was designed to protect its Base Areas and sanctuaries in eastern Cambodia, without which the prosecution of its military effort in South Vietnam would have been more difficult. Their presence was at first tolerated by Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian head of state, but domestic resistance combined with China and North Vietnam continuing to provide aid to the anti-government Khmer Rouge alarmed Sihanouk and caused him to go to Moscow to request the Soviets rein in the behavior of North Vietnam.<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 90\"/> The [[Cambodian coup of 1970|deposition of Sihanouk by the Cambodian National Assembly in March 1970]], following wide scale protests in the capital against the presence of PAVN troops in the country, put a pro-American government in power (later declared the Khmer Republic) which demanded that the PAVN leave Cambodia. The PAVN refused and, at the request of the Khmer Rouge, promptly invaded Cambodia in force.\n\nBetween March and June 1970, the North Vietnamese captured most of the northeastern third of the country in engagements with the Cambodian army.  The North Vietnamese turned over some of their conquests and provided other assistance to the Khmer Rouge, thus empowering what was at the time a small guerrilla movement.<ref name=GlobalSecurity>{{cite web|title=Cambodia: U.S. Invasion, 1970s|publisher=Global Security|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/cambodia1.htm|accessdate=2 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031060436/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/cambodia1.htm|archive-date=31 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The Cambodian government hastened to expand its army to combat the North Vietnamese and the growing power of the Khmer Rouge.<ref name=\"Mosyakov\">Dmitry Mosyakov, \"The Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists: A History of Their Relations as Told in the Soviet Archives,\" in Susan E.

Available online at: www.yale.edu/gsp/publications/Mosyakov.doc \"In April\u2013May 1970, many North Vietnamese forces entered Cambodia in response to the call for help addressed to Vietnam not by Pol Pot, but by his deputy Nuon Chea. Nguyen Co Thach recalls: \"Nuon Chea has asked for help and we have liberated five provinces of Cambodia in ten days.\"\"</ref>\n\nThe U.S. was motivated by the desire to buy time for its withdrawal from Southeast Asia, to protect its ally in South Vietnam, and to prevent the spread of communism to Cambodia. American and both South and North Vietnamese forces directly participated (at one time or another) in the fighting. The U.S. assisted the central government with massive U.S. aerial bombing campaigns and direct material and financial aid, while the North Vietnamese kept soldiers on the lands that they had previously occupied and occasionally engaged the Khmer Republic army in ground combat.\n\nAfter five years of savage fighting, the Republican government was defeated on 17 April 1975 when the victorious Khmer Rouge proclaimed the establishment of [[Democratic Kampuchea]]. The war caused a refugee crisis in Cambodia with two million people\u2014more than 25 percent of the population\u2014displaced from rural areas into the cities, especially Phnom Penh which grew from about 600,000 in 1970 to an estimated population of nearly 2&nbsp;million by 1975.\n\nChildren were widely used during and after the war, often being persuaded or forced to commit atrocities.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/features/blogs/cambodiablog/blog6_cambodia_southerland-20060720.html|title=Cambodia Diary 6: Child Soldiers \u2013 Driven by Fear and Hate|last=Southerland|first=D|date=20 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320105641/https://www.rfa.org/english/features/blogs/cambodiablog/blog6_cambodia_southerland-20060720.html|archive-date=20 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The Cambodian government estimated that more than 20 percent of the property in the country had been destroyed during the war.<ref name=\"Shawcross, William 1979, p. 222\">Shawcross, William, ''Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia'' New York: Simon and Schuster, 1979, p. 222</ref> In total, an estimated 275,000\u2013310,000 people were killed as a result of the war.\n\nThe conflict was part of the [[Indochina Wars|Second Indochina War]] (1955\u20131975) which also consumed the neighboring [[Kingdom of Laos]], South Vietnam, and North Vietnam individually referred to as the [[Laotian Civil War]] and the [[Vietnam War]] respectively.

In 1966, an agreement was struck between the prince and the Chinese, allowing the presence of large-scale PAVN and Viet Cong troop deployments and logistical bases in the eastern border regions.<ref name=\"Lipsman and Doyle, p. 127\">Lipsman and Doyle, p. 127.</ref> He had also agreed to allow the use of the port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] by communist-flagged vessels delivering supplies and material to support the PAVN/Viet Cong military effort in South Vietnam.<ref>''Victory in Vietnam'', p. 465, fn. 24.</ref> These concessions made questionable Cambodia's [[Neutral country|neutrality]], which had been guaranteed by the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] of 1954.\n[[File:Mao Sihanouk.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Meeting in Beijing: Mao Zedong (left), Prince Sihanouk (center), and Liu Shaoqi (right)]]\nSihanouk was convinced that the PRC, not the U.S., would eventually control the Indochinese Peninsula and that \"our interests are best served by dealing with the camp that one day will dominate the whole of Asia \u2013 and coming to terms before its victory \u2013 in order to obtain the best terms possible.\"<ref name=\"Lipsman and Doyle, p. 127\"/>\n\nDuring the same year, however, he allowed his pro-American minister of defense, General [[Lon Nol]], to crack down on leftist activities, crushing the ''Pracheachon'' by accusing its members of subversion and subservience to [[Hanoi]].<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 85\">Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 85.</ref> Simultaneously, Sihanouk lost the support of Cambodia's conservatives as a result of his failure to come to grips with the deteriorating economic situation (exacerbated by the loss of rice exports, most of which went to the PAVN/Viet Cong) and with the growing communist military presence.{{efn|Beginning in 1966, Cambodians sold 100,000 tons of Cambodian rice to PAVN, who offered the world price and paid in U.S. dollars. The government paid only a low fixed price and thereby lost the taxes and profits that would have been gained. The drop in rice for export (from 583,700 tons in 1965 to 199,049 tons in 1966) elevated an economic crises that grew worse with each passing year.<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 85\"/>}}\n\nOn 11 September 1966, Cambodia held its first open election. Through manipulation and harassment (and to Sihanouk's surprise) the conservatives won 75 percent of the seats in the National Assembly.<ref>Chandler, pp. 153\u2013156.</ref><ref>Osborne, p. 187.</ref> Lon Nol was chosen by the right as prime minister and, as his deputy, they named [[Prince Sirik Matak]]; an ultraconservative member of the Sisowath branch of the royal clan and long-time enemy of Sihanouk.

To maintain the balance against the rising tide of the conservatives, he named the leaders of the very group he had been oppressing as members of a \"counter-government\" that was meant to monitor and criticize Lon Nol's administration.<ref name=\"ihb86\">Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 86.</ref> One of Lon Nol's first priorities was to fix the ailing economy by halting the illegal sale of rice to the communists. Soldiers were dispatched to the rice-growing areas to forcibly collect the harvests at gunpoint, and they paid only the low government price. There was widespread unrest, especially in rice-rich [[Battambang Province]], an area long-noted for the presence of large landowners, great disparity in wealth, and where the communists still had some influence.<ref>Chandler, pp. 164\u2013165.</ref><ref>Osborne, p. 192.</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GenLonNol.jpg|thumb|right|200px|General Lon Nol]] -->\nOn 11 March 1967, while Sihanouk was out of the country in France, a rebellion broke out in the area around Samlaut in Battambang, when enraged villagers attacked a tax collection brigade.

Lon Nol was forced to resign, and, in a typical move, the prince named new leftists to the government to balance the conservatives.<ref name=\"c166\">Chandler, p. 166.</ref> The immediate crisis had passed, but it engendered two tragic consequences. First, it drove thousands of new recruits into the arms of the hard-line ''maquis'' of the Cambodian Communist Party (which Sihanouk labelled the ''[[Khmers rouges]]'' (\"Red Khmers\")). Second, for the peasantry, the name of Lon Nol became associated with ruthless repression throughout Cambodia.<ref>Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 87.</ref>\n\n=== Communist regroupment ===\n{{details|Khmer Rouge}}\n\nWhile the 1967 insurgency had been unplanned, the Khmer Rouge tried, without much success, to organize a more serious revolt during the following year. The prince's decimation of the Prachea Chon and the urban communists had, however, cleared the field of competition for Saloth Sar (also known as [[Pol Pot]]), Ieng Sary, and Son Sen\u2014the [[Maoism|Maoist]] leadership of the ''maquisards''.<ref>Chandler, p. 128.</ref> They led their followers into the highlands of the northeast and into the lands of the [[Khmer Loeu]], a primitive people who were hostile to both the lowland Khmers and the central government. For the Khmer Rouge, who still lacked assistance from the North Vietnamese, it was a period of regroupment, organization, and training. Hanoi basically ignored its Chinese-sponsored allies, and the indifference of their \"fraternal comrades\" to their insurgency between 1967 and 1969 would make an indelible impression on the Khmer Rouge leadership.<ref>Deac, p. 55.</ref><ref>Chandler, p. 141.</ref>\n\nOn 17 January 1968, the Khmer Rouge launched their first offensive. It was aimed more at gathering weapons and spreading propaganda than in seizing territory since, at that time, the adherents of the insurgency numbered no more than 4\u20135,000.<ref name=\"Sutsakhan, p. 32\">Sutsakhan, p. 32.</ref><ref>Chandler, pp. 174\u2013176.</ref> During the same month, the communists established the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea as the military wing of the party. As early as the end of the Battambang revolt, Sihanouk had begun to reevaluate his relationship with the communists.<ref>Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 89.</ref> His earlier agreement with the Chinese had availed him nothing. They had not only failed to restrain the North Vietnamese, but they had actually involved themselves (through the Khmer Rouge) in active subversion within his country.<ref name=\"Lipsman and Doyle, p. 130\" />\nAt the suggestion of Lon Nol (who had returned to the cabinet as defense minister in November 1968) and other conservative politicians, on 11 May 1969, the prince welcomed the restoration of normal diplomatic relations with the U.S. and created a new Government of National Salvation with Lon Nol as his prime minister.<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 90\">Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 90.</ref> He did so \"in order to play a new card, since the Asian communists are already attacking us before the end of the Vietnam War.\"<ref>Lipsman and Doyle, p. 140.</ref> Besides, PAVN and the Viet Cong would make very convenient scapegoats for Cambodia's ills, much more so than the minuscule Khmer Rouge, and ridding Cambodia of their presence would solve many problems simultaneously.<ref>Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 88.</ref>\n\n=== Operation Menu and Operation Freedom Deal ===\nAlthough the U.S. had been aware of the PAVN/Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia since 1966, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had chosen not to attack them due to possible international repercussions and his belief that Sihanouk could be convinced to alter his policies.<ref>Karnow, p. 590.</ref> Johnson did, however, authorize the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group]] (SOG) to enter Cambodia and gather intelligence on the Base Areas in 1967.<ref>Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, ''Command History 1967'', Annex F, Saigon, 1968, p. 4.</ref> The election of [[Richard M. Nixon]] in 1968 and the introduction of his policies of gradual U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and the [[Vietnamization]] of the conflict there, changed everything.\n\nOn 18 March 1969, on secret orders from Nixon and [[Henry Kissinger]], the [[U.S. Air Force]] carried out the bombing of Base Area 353 (in the [[Fishhook (Cambodia)|Fishhook]] region opposite South Vietnam's [[T\u00e2y Ninh Province]]) by 59 [[B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers. This strike was the first in a series of attacks on the sanctuaries that lasted until May 1970. During [[Operation Menu]], the Air Force conducted 3,875 sorties and dropped more than 108,000 tons of ordnance on the eastern border areas.<ref>Nalty, pp. 127\u2013133.</ref> Only five high-ranking Congressional officials were informed of the bombing.<ref>Clymer, Kenton (2004), ''United States and Cambodia: 1969\u20132000'', Routledge, pg. 12.</ref>\n\nAfter the event, it was claimed by Nixon and Kissinger that Sihanouk had given his tacit approval for the raids, but this is dubious.<ref>Shawcross, pps. 68\u201371 & 93\u201394.</ref> Sihanouk told U.S. diplomat [[Chester Bowles]] on 10 January 1968, that he would not oppose American \"hot pursuit\" of retreating North Vietnamese troops \"in remote areas [of Cambodia],\" provided that Cambodians were unharmed. Kenton Clymer notes that this statement \"cannot reasonably be construed to mean that Sihanouk approved of the intensive, ongoing B-52 bombing raids&nbsp;... In any event, no one asked him.&nbsp;...

Under Freedom Deal, from 19 May 1970 to 15 August 1973, U.S. bombing of Cambodia extended over the entire eastern one-half of the country and was especially intense in the heavily populated southeastern one-quarter of the country, including a wide ring surrounding the largest city of Phnom Penh.

They were dispersed, with many casualties, by contingents of the armed forces.\n\n===Massacre of the Vietnamese===\nMost of the population, urban and rural, took out their anger and frustrations on the nation's Vietnamese population.

In his apology to the [[Saigon]] government, Lon Nol stated that \"it was difficult to distinguish between Vietnamese citizens who were Viet Cong and those who were not. So it is quite normal that the reaction of Cambodian troops, who feel themselves betrayed, is difficult to control.\"<ref>Lipsman and Doyle, p. 146.</ref>\n\n===FUNK and GRUNK===\nFrom Beijing, Sihanouk proclaimed that the government in Phnom Penh was dissolved and his intention to create the ''Front uni national du Kampuch\u00e9a'' ([[National United Front of Kampuchea]]) or FUNK. Sihanouk later said \"I had chosen not to be with either the Americans or the communists, because I considered that there were two dangers, American imperialism and Asian communism. It was Lon Nol who obliged me to choose between them.\"<ref name=\"ld144\"/>\n\nThe North Vietnamese reacted to the political changes in Cambodia by sending Premier [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng]] to meet Sihanouk in China and recruit him into an alliance with the Khmer Rouge. Pol Pot was also contacted by the Vietnamese who now offered him whatever resources he wanted for his insurgency against the Cambodian government. Pol Pot and Sihanouk were actually in Beijing at the same time, but the Vietnamese and Chinese leaders never informed Sihanouk of the presence of Pol Pot or allowed the two men to meet. Shortly after, Sihanouk issued an appeal by radio to the people of Cambodia to rise up against the government and support the Khmer Rouge. In doing so, Sihanouk lent his name and popularity in the rural areas of Cambodia to a movement over which he had little control.<ref>David P. Chandler, ''The Tragedy of Cambodian History'', New Haven CT: Yale University Press, 1991, p. 231.</ref> In May 1970, Pol Pot finally returned to Cambodia and the pace of the insurgency greatly increased. After Sihanouk showed his support for the Khmer Rouge by visiting them in the field, their ranks swelled from 6,000 to 50,000 fighters.\n\nThe prince then allied himself with the Khmer Rouge, the North Vietnamese, the Laotian [[Pathet Lao]] and the Viet Cong, throwing his personal prestige behind the communists. On 5 May, the actual establishment of FUNK and of the ''Gouvernement royal d'union nationale du Kampuch\u00e9a'' or [[GRUNK]] (Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea), was proclaimed. Sihanouk assumed the post of head of state, appointing [[Penn Nouth]], one of his most loyal supporters, as prime minister.<ref name=\"ld144\"/>\n\nKhieu Samphan was designated deputy prime minister, minister of defense, and commander in chief of the GRUNK armed forces (though actual military operations were directed by Pol Pot). Hu Nim became minister of information, and Hou Yuon assumed multiple responsibilities as minister of the interior, communal reforms, and cooperatives. GRUNK claimed that it was not a government-in-exile since Khieu Samphan and the insurgents remained inside Cambodia. Sihanouk and his loyalists remained in China, although the prince did make a visit to the \"liberated areas\" of Cambodia, including [[Angkor Wat]], in March 1973. These visits were used mainly for propaganda purposes and had no real influence on political affairs.<ref>Chandler, pp. 228\u2013229.</ref>\n\nFor Sihanouk, this proved to be a [[marriage of convenience]] that was spurred on by his thirst for revenge against those who had betrayed him.<ref>Chandler, p. 200.</ref><ref>Osborne, pp. 214, 218.</ref> For the Khmer Rouge, it was a means to greatly expand the appeal of their movement. Peasants, motivated by loyalty to the monarchy, gradually rallied to the GRUNK cause.<ref>Chandler, p. 201.</ref> The personal appeal of Sihanouk and widespread US aerial bombardment helped recruitment. This task was made even easier for the communists after 9 October 1970, when Lon Nol abolished the loosely federalist monarchy and proclaimed the establishment of a centralized [[Khmer Republic]].<ref>Chandler, p. 202.</ref>\n\nThe GRUNK was soon caught between the competing Communist powers: North Vietnam, China and the Soviet Union. During the visits that Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] and Sihanouk paid to [[North Korea]] in April and June 1970, respectively, they called for the establishment of a \"united front of the five revolutionary Asian countries\" (China, North Korea, North Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, the last being represented by the GRUNK). While the North Korean leaders enthusiastically welcomed the plan, it soon foundered on Hanoi's opposition. Having realized that such a front would exclude the Soviet Union and implicitly challenge the hegemonic role that the DRV had arrogated to itself in Indochina, the North Vietnamese leaders declared that all communist states should join forces against \"American imperialism.\" Indeed, the issue of Vietnamese versus Chinese hegemony over Indochina greatly influenced the attitude Hanoi adopted towards Moscow in the early and mid-1970s. During the Cambodian civil war, the Soviet leaders, ready to acquiesce in Hanoi's dominance over Laos and Cambodia, actually insisted on sending their aid shipments to the Khmer Rouge through the DRV, whereas China firmly rebuffed Hanoi's proposal that Chinese aid to Cambodia be sent via North Vietnam. Facing Chinese competition and Soviet acquiescence, the North Vietnamese leaders found the Soviet option more advantageous to their interests, a calculation that played a major role in the gradual pro-Soviet shift in Hanoi's foreign policies.<ref>{{cite book|first=Bal\u00e1zs|last=Szalontai|chapter=Political and Economic Relations between Communist States|editor-first=Stephen Anthony|editor-last=Smith |title=Oxford Handbook in the History of Communism|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2014|page=316}}</ref>\n\n==Widening war (1970\u20131971)==\n\n===North Vietnamese offensive in Cambodia===\nIn the wake of the coup, Lon Nol did not immediately launch Cambodia into war.

Cambodia's army was mauled, lands containing nearly half of the Cambodian population were conquered and handed over to the Khmer Rouge and North Vietnam now took an active role in supplying and training the Khmer Rouge. All of this resulted in the Cambodian government being greatly weakened and the insurgents multiplying several fold in size over the course of a few weeks. As noted in the official Vietnamese war history, \"our troops helped our Cambodian friends to completely liberate five provinces with a total population of three million people... our troops also helped our Cambodian friends train cadre and expand their armed forces. In just two months the armed forces of our Cambodian allies grew from ten guerrilla teams to nine battalions and 80 companies of full-time troops with a total strength of 20,000 soldiers, plus hundreds of guerrilla squads and platoons in the villages.\"<ref>\"Victory in Vietnam: The Official History of the People's Army of Vietnam, 1954\u20131975.\" University Press of Kansas, May 2002 (original 1995).

He learned about it only after it had begun from the head of the U.S. mission, who had himself learned about it from a radio broadcast.<ref name=\"k608\"/>\n\nExtensive logistical installations and large amounts of supplies were found and destroyed, but as reporting from the American command in Saigon disclosed, still larger amounts of military material had already been moved further from the border to shelter it from the incursion into Cambodia by the U.S. and South Vietnam.<ref>Deac, p. 79.</ref>\n\nOn the day the incursion was launched, the North Vietnamese launched an offensive (Campaign ''X'') of its own against FANK forces at the request of the Khmer Rouge<ref>Dmitry Mosyakov, \"The Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists: A History of Their\nRelations as Told in the Soviet Archives,\" in Susan E.

Artillery support was provided by the ''69th Artillery Division''.</ref> By June, three months after the removal of Sihanouk, they had swept government forces from the entire northeastern third of the country. After defeating those forces, the North Vietnamese turned the newly won territories over to the local insurgents. The Khmer Rouge also established \"liberated\" areas in the south and the southwestern parts of the country, where they operated independently of the North Vietnamese.<ref name=\"Sutsakhan, p. 32\"/>\n\n===Opposing sides===\nAs combat operations quickly revealed, the two sides were badly mismatched. FANK, whose ranks had been increased by thousands of young urban Cambodians who had flocked to join it in the months following the removal of Sihanouk, had expanded well beyond its capacity to absorb the new men.<ref>Sutsakhan, p. 48.</ref> Later, given the press of tactical operations and the need to replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.<ref>Deac, p. 172.</ref>\nDuring the period 1974\u20131975, FANK forces officially grew from 100,000 to approximately 250,000 men, but probably only numbered around 180,000 due to payroll padding by their officers and due to desertions.<ref>Sutsakhan, p. 39.</ref> U.S. military aid (ammunition, supplies, and equipment) was funneled to FANK through the Military Equipment Delivery Team, Cambodia (MEDTC).

The officer corps of FANK was generally corrupt and greedy.<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 108\">Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 108.</ref> The inclusion of \"ghost\" soldiers allowed massive payroll padding; ration allowances were kept by the officers while their men starved; and the sale of arms and ammunition on the black market (or to the enemy) was commonplace.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 313\u2013315.</ref><ref>Chandler, p. 205.</ref> Worse, the tactical ineptitude among FANK officers was as common as their greed.<ref>General [[Creighton Abrams]], commander of the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] dispatched General Conroy to Phnom Penh to observe the situation and report back. Conroy's conclusions were that the Cambodian officer corps \"had no combat experience...did not know how to run an army nor were they seemingly concerned about their ignorance in the face of the mortal threats that they faced.\" Shaw, p. 137.</ref> Lon Nol frequently bypassed the general staff and directed operations down to battalion-level while also forbidding any real coordination between the army, navy and air force.<ref name=\"Sutsakhan, p. 89\">Sutsakhan, p. 89.</ref>\n\nThe common soldiers fought bravely at first, but they were saddled with low pay (with which they had to purchase their own food and medical care), ammunition shortages, and mixed equipment. Due to the pay system, there were no allotments for their families, who were, therefore, forced to follow their husbands/sons into the battle zones. These problems (exacerbated by continuously declining morale) only increased over time.<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 108\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of 1974, the Cambodian army inventory included 241,630 rifles, 7,079 machine guns, 2,726 mortars, 20,481 grenade launchers, 304 recoilless rifles, 289 howitzers, 202 APCs, and 4,316 trucks. The [[Khmer National Navy|Khmer Navy]] had 171 vessels; the [[Khmer Air Force]] had 211 aircraft, including 64 [[North American T-28 Trojan|North American T-28s]], 14 [[Douglas AC-47 Spooky|Douglas AC-47]] gunships and 44 helicopters. American Embassy military personnel \u2013 who were only supposed to coordinate the arms aid program \u2013 sometimes found themselves involved in prohibited advisory and combat tasks.\n\nWhen PAVN forces were supplanted, it was by the tough, rigidly indoctrinated peasant army of the Khmer Rouge with its core of seasoned leaders, who now received the full support of Hanoi. Khmer Rouge forces, which had been reorganized at an Indochinese summit held in [[Guangzhou]], China in April 1970, would grow from 12\u201315,000 in 1970 to 35\u201340,000 by 1972, when the so-called \"Khmerization\" of the conflict took place and combat operations against the Republic were handed over completely to the insurgents.<ref>Sutsakhan, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\nThe development of these forces took place in three stages. 1970 to 1972 was a period of organization and recruitment, during which Khmer Rouge units served as auxiliaries to the PAVN. From 1972 to mid-1974, the insurgents formed units of battalion and regimental size. It was during this period that the Khmer Rouge began to break away from Sihanouk and his supporters and the collectivization of agriculture was begun in the \"liberated\" areas. Division-sized units were being fielded by 1974\u20131975, when the party was on its own and began the radical transformation of the country.<ref>The evolution of the communist forces is described in Sutsakhan, pp. 78\u201382.</ref>\n\nWith the fall of Sihanouk, Hanoi became alarmed at the prospect of a pro-Western regime that might allow the Americans to establish a military presence on their western flank. To prevent that from happening, they began transferring their military installations away from the border regions to locations deeper within Cambodian territory. A new command center was established at the city of [[Krati\u00e9 (city)|Krati\u00e9]] and the timing of the move was propitious. President Nixon was of the opinion that:\n\n<blockquote>We need a bold move in Cambodia to show that we stand with Lon Nol...something symbolic...for the only Cambodian regime that had the guts to take a pro-Western and pro-American stand.<ref name=\"k608\">Karnow, p. 608.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===''Chenla II''===\n{{details|Operation Chenla II}}\n[[File:Areas of Cambodia under government control August 1970.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Areas under government control, August 1970]]\nDuring the night of 21 January 1971, a force of 100 PAVN/Viet Cong commandos [[Khmer Air Force#The Pochentong raid|attacked]] [[Phnom Penh International Airport|Pochentong airfield]], the main base of the Khmer Air Force. In this one action, the raiders destroyed almost the entire inventory of government aircraft, including all of its fighter planes. This may have been a blessing in disguise, however, since the air force was largely composed of old (even obsolete) Soviet aircraft. The Americans soon replaced the airplanes with more advanced models. The attack did, however, stall a proposed FANK offensive. Two weeks later, Lon Nol suffered a stroke and was evacuated to Hawaii for treatment. It had been a mild stroke, however, and the general recovered quickly, returning to Cambodia after only two months.\n\nIt was not until 20 August that FANK launched Operation Chenla II, its first offensive of the year. The objective of the campaign was to clear Route 6 of enemy forces and thereby reopen communications with [[Kampong Thom City|Kompong Thom]], the Republic's second largest city, which had been isolated from the capital for more than a year. The operation was initially successful, and the city was relieved. The PAVN and Khmer Rouge counterattacked in November and December, annihilating government forces in the process. There was never an accurate count of the losses, but the estimate was \"on the order of ten battalions of personnel and equipment lost plus the equipment of an additional ten battalions.\"<ref>Sutsakhan, p. 79</ref> The strategic result of the failure of ''Chenla II'' was that the offensive initiative passed completely into the hands of PAVN and the Khmer Rouge.\n\n==Agony of the Khmer Republic (1972\u20131975)==\n\n===Struggling to survive===\n{{details|topic=the bombing campaign|Operation Freedom Deal}}\nFrom 1972 through 1974, the war was conducted along FANK's lines of communications north and south of the capital. Limited offensives were launched to maintain contact with the rice-growing regions of the northwest and along the Mekong River and Route 5, the Republic's overland connections to South Vietnam. The strategy of the Khmer Rouge was to gradually cut those lines of communication and squeeze Phnom Penh. As a result, FANK forces became fragmented, isolated, and unable to lend one another mutual support.\n\n[[File:Cambodian Civil War-era T-54 or Type 59.jpg|thumb|left|A memorial to the civil war in [[Siem Reap]], Cambodia, with a rusted wreck of a Soviet-built [[T-54/55|T-54]] main battle tank used during the war.

When President Nixon launched the incursion in 1970, American and South Vietnamese troops operated under an umbrella of air cover that was designated Operation Freedom Deal. When those troops were withdrawn, the air operation continued, ostensibly to interdict PAVN/Viet Cong troop movements and logistics.<ref>Nalty, p. 199.</ref> In reality (and unknown to the U.S. Congress and American public), they were utilized to provide tactical air support to FANK.<ref>Douglas Pike, John Prados, James W.

He then forced Cheng Heng, the head of state since Sihanouk's deposition, to surrender his authority to him. On the second anniversary of the coup, Lon Nol relinquished his authority as head of state, but retained his position as prime minister and defense minister.\n\nOn 4 June, Lon Nol was elected as the first president of the Khmer Republic in a blatantly rigged election.<ref>Chandler, pp. 222\u2013223.</ref> As per the new constitution (ratified on 30 April), political parties formed in the new nation, quickly becoming a source of political factionalism. General Sutsakhan stated: \"the seeds of democratization, which had been thrown into the wind with such goodwill by the Khmer leaders, returned for the Khmer Republic nothing but a poor harvest.\"<ref name=\"Sutsakhan, p. 89\"/>\n\nIn January 1973, hope was renewed when the [[Paris Peace Accords]] were signed, ending the conflict (for the time being) in South Vietnam and Laos. On 29 January, Lon Nol proclaimed a unilateral cease-fire throughout the nation. All U.S. bombing operations were halted in hopes of securing a chance for peace. It was not to be. The Khmer Rouge simply ignored the proclamation and carried on fighting. By March, heavy casualties, desertions, and low recruitment had forced Lon Nol to introduce conscription, and in April insurgent forces launched an offensive that pushed into the suburbs of the capital. The U.S. Air Force responded by launching an intense bombing operation that forced the communists back into the countryside after being decimated by the air strikes.<ref>Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 100.</ref> The US Seventh Air Force argued that the bombing prevented the fall of Phnom Penh in 1973 by killing 16,000 of 25,500 Khmer Rouge fighters besieging the city.<ref>{{cite book|last=Etcheson|first=Craig|title=The Rise and Demise of Democratic Kampuchea|publisher=Westview|year=1984|isbn=0-86531-650-3|page=118}}</ref>\n\nBy the last day of Operation Freedom Deal (15 August 1973), 250,000 tons of bombs had been dropped on the Khmer Republic, 82,000 tons of which had been released in the last 45 days of the operation.<ref>Morrocco, p. 172.</ref> Since the inception of Operation Menu in 1969, the U.S. Air Force had dropped 539,129 tons of ordnance on Cambodia/Khmer Republic.<ref>Shawcross, p. 297.</ref>\n\n===Shape of things to come===\nAs late as 1972\u20131973, it was a commonly held belief, both within and outside Cambodia, that the war was essentially a foreign conflict that had not fundamentally altered the nature of the Khmer people.<ref name=\"ihb106\">Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 106.</ref> By late 1973, there was a growing awareness among the government and population of Cambodia that the extremism, total lack of concern over casualties, and complete rejection of any offer of peace talks \"began to suggest that Khmer Rouge fanaticism and capacity for violence were deeper than anyone had suspected.\"<ref name=\"ihb106\"/>\n\nReports of the brutal policies of the organization soon made their way to Phnom Penh and into the population foretelling the violence that was about to consume the nation. There were tales of the forced relocations of entire villages, of the summary execution of any who disobeyed or even asked questions, the forbidding of religious practices, of monks who were defrocked or murdered, and where traditional sexual and marital habits were foresworn.<ref name=\"Isaacs pp. 106\">Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, pp. 106\u2013107.</ref><ref>Shawcross, p. 322.</ref> War was one thing; the offhand manner in which the Khmer Rouge dealt out death, so contrary to the Khmer character, was quite another.<ref>Osborne, p. 203.</ref> Reports of these atrocities began to surface during the same period in which North Vietnamese troops were withdrawing from the Cambodian battlefields. This was no coincidence.

They were referred to by their fellow countrymen as ''peap prey'' \u2013 the forest army. Previously, the very existence of the communist party as a component of GRUNK had been hidden.<ref name=\"Isaacs pp. 106\"/> Within the \"liberated zones\" it was simply referred to as \"Angka\" \u2013 the organization. During 1973, the communist party fell under the control of its most fanatical members, Pol Pot and Son Sen, who believed that \"Cambodia was to go through a total social revolution and that everything that had preceded it was anathema and must be destroyed.\"<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 107\"/>\n\nAlso hidden from scrutiny was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies.<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 107\"/><ref>Chandler, p. 216.</ref> The radical leadership of the party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master.<ref>Ideology was not all that separated the two communist groups.

Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.<ref>Chandler, p. 211.</ref>\n\nAs time passed, the need of the Khmer Rouge for the support of Prince Sihanouk lessened.

He said that his hopes for a moderate socialism akin to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]'s must now be totally dismissed. [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Stalinist Albania]], he said, would be the model.<ref>Shawcross, p. 343.</ref>\n\n===Fall of Phnom Penh===\n{{main|Fall of Phnom Penh}}\n{{details|Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia}}\n[[File:Cambodian Civil War map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The final offensive against [[Phnom Penh]] in April 1975]]\n\nBy the time the Khmer Rouge initiated their dry-season offensive to capture the beleaguered Cambodian capital on 1 January 1975, the Republic was in chaos. The economy had been gutted, the transportation network had been reduced to air and waterways, the rice harvest had fallen by one-quarter, and the supply of freshwater fish (the chief source of protein for the country) had declined drastically. The cost of food was 20 times greater than pre-war levels, while unemployment was not even measured anymore.<ref>Lipsman and Weiss, p. 119.</ref>\n\nPhnom Penh, which had a pre-war population of around 600,000, was overwhelmed by refugees (who continued to flood in from the steadily collapsing defense perimeter), growing to a size of around two million. These helpless and desperate civilians had no jobs and little in the way of food, shelter, or medical care. Their condition (and the government's) only worsened when Khmer Rouge forces gradually gained control of the banks of the Mekong. From the riverbanks, their mines and gunfire steadily reduced the river convoys through which 90 percent of the Republic's supplies moved, bringing relief supplies of food, fuel, and ammunition to the slowly starving city from South Vietnam. After the river was effectively blocked in early February, the U.S. began an airlift of supplies into Pochentong Airport. This became increasingly risky, however, due to communist rocket and artillery fire, which constantly rained down on the airfield and city. The Khmer Rouge cut off overland supplies to the city for more than a year before it fell on 17 April 1975. Reports from journalists stated that the Khmer Rouge shelling \"tortured the capital almost continuously,\" inflicting \"random death and mutilation\" on millions of trapped civilians.<ref>[[John Barron (journalist)|Barron, John]] and Anthony Paul (1977), ''Murder of a Gentle Land'', Reader's Digest Press, pp. 1\u20132.</ref>\n\nDesperate but determined units of FANK soldiers, many of whom had run out of ammunition, dug in around the capital and fought until they were overrun as the Khmer Rouge advanced. By the last week of March 1975, approximately 40,000 communist troops had surrounded the capital and began preparing to deliver the ''coup de grace'' to about half as many FANK forces.<ref>Snepp, p. 279.</ref>\n\nLon Nol resigned and left the country on 1 April, hoping that a negotiated settlement might still be possible if he was absent from the political scene.<ref>Deac, p. 218.</ref> [[Saukam Khoy]] became acting president of a government that had less than three weeks to live. Last-minute efforts on the part of the U.S. to arrange a peace agreement involving Sihanouk ended in failure. When a vote in the U.S. Congress for a resumption of American air support failed, panic and a sense of doom pervaded the capital. The situation was best described by General Sak Sutsakhan (now FANK chief of staff):\n\n<blockquote>The picture of the Khmer Republic which came to mind at that time was one of a sick man who survived only by outside means and that, in its condition, the administration of medication, however efficient it might be, was probably of no further value.<ref>Sutsakhan, p. 155.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Saukham Koy arrives on USS Okinawa.jpg|thumb|left|Saukham Khoy, successor to Lon Nol as President of the Khmer Republic arrives on board the {{USS|Okinawa|LPH-3|6}} on 12 April 1975 after being evacuated from Phnom Penh.]]\n\nOn 12 April, concluding that all was lost, the U.S. evacuated its embassy personnel by helicopter during [[Operation Eagle Pull]]. The 276 evacuees included U.S. Ambassador [[John Gunther Dean]], other American diplomatic personnel, [[Acting President]] Saukam Khoy, senior Khmer Republic government officials and their families, and members of the news media.

Their names were not published on the death lists and many trusted the Khmer Rouge's assertions that former government officials would not be murdered, but would be welcome in helping to rebuild a new Cambodia.\n\nAfter the Americans (and Saukam Khoy) had departed, a seven-member Supreme Committee, headed by General Sak Sutsakhan, assumed authority over the collapsing Republic. By 15 April, the last solid defenses of the city were overcome by the communists. In the early morning hours of 17 April, the committee decided to move the seat of government to [[Oddar Meanchey Province]] in the northwest. Around 10:00, the voice of General Mey Si Chan of the FANK general staff broadcast on the radio, ordering all FANK forces to cease firing, since \"negotiations were in progress\" for the surrender of Phnom Penh.<ref>Ponchaud, p. 7.</ref> The war was over, but the sinister plans of the Khmer Rouge were about to come to fruition in the newly proclaimed [[Democratic Kampuchea]].

However, it is not clear how these numbers were calculated or whether they disaggregate civilian and soldier deaths. Others' attempts to verify the numbers suggest a lower number. Demographer Patrick Heuveline has produced evidence suggesting a range of 150,000 to 300,000 violent deaths from 1970 to 1975. In an article reviewing different sources about civilian deaths during the civil war, Bruce Sharp argues that the total number is likely to be around 250,000 violent deaths.&nbsp;... [Heuveline]'s conclusion is that an average of 2.52 million people (range of 1.17\u20133.42 million) died as a result of regime actions between 1970 and 1979, with an average estimate of 1.4 million (range of 1.09\u20132.16 million) directly violent deaths.}}</ref><ref name=\"Banister, Judith 1993\">{{cite book|last1=Banister|first1=Judith|last2=Johnson|first2=E.

North Vietnam's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) involvement was designed to protect its Base Areas and sanctuaries in eastern Cambodia, without which the prosecution of its military effort in South Vietnam would have been more difficult. Their presence was at first tolerated by Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian head of state, but domestic resistance combined with China and North Vietnam continuing to provide aid to the anti-government Khmer Rouge alarmed Sihanouk and caused him to go to Moscow to request the Soviets rein in the behavior of North Vietnam.<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 90\"/> The [[Cambodian coup of 1970|deposition of Sihanouk by the Cambodian National Assembly in March 1970]], following wide scale protests in the capital against the presence of PAVN troops in the country, put a pro-American government in power (later declared the Khmer Republic) which demanded that the PAVN leave Cambodia. The PAVN refused and, at the request of the Khmer Rouge, promptly invaded Cambodia in force.\n\nBetween March and June 1970, the North Vietnamese captured most of the northeastern third of the country in engagements with the Cambodian army.  The North Vietnamese turned over some of their conquests and provided other assistance to the Khmer Rouge, thus empowering what was at the time a small guerrilla movement.<ref name=GlobalSecurity>{{cite web|title=Cambodia: U.S. Invasion, 1970s|publisher=Global Security|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/cambodia1.htm|accessdate=2 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031060436/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/cambodia1.htm|archive-date=31 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The Cambodian government hastened to expand its army to combat the North Vietnamese and the growing power of the Khmer Rouge.<ref name=\"Mosyakov\">Dmitry Mosyakov, \"The Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists: A History of Their Relations as Told in the Soviet Archives,\" in Susan E.

American and both South and North Vietnamese forces directly participated (at one time or another) in the fighting. The U.S. assisted the central government with massive U.S. aerial bombing campaigns and direct material and financial aid, while the North Vietnamese kept soldiers on the lands that they had previously occupied and occasionally engaged the Khmer Republic army in ground combat.\n\nAfter five years of savage fighting, the Republican government was defeated on 17 April 1975 when the victorious Khmer Rouge proclaimed the establishment of [[Democratic Kampuchea]].

In 1966, an agreement was struck between the prince and the Chinese, allowing the presence of large-scale PAVN and Viet Cong troop deployments and logistical bases in the eastern border regions.<ref name=\"Lipsman and Doyle, p. 127\">Lipsman and Doyle, p. 127.</ref> He had also agreed to allow the use of the port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] by communist-flagged vessels delivering supplies and material to support the PAVN/Viet Cong military effort in South Vietnam.<ref>''Victory in Vietnam'', p. 465, fn. 24.</ref> These concessions made questionable Cambodia's [[Neutral country|neutrality]], which had been guaranteed by the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] of 1954.\n[[File:Mao Sihanouk.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Meeting in Beijing: Mao Zedong (left), Prince Sihanouk (center), and Liu Shaoqi (right)]]\nSihanouk was convinced that the PRC, not the U.S., would eventually control the Indochinese Peninsula and that \"our interests are best served by dealing with the camp that one day will dominate the whole of Asia \u2013 and coming to terms before its victory \u2013 in order to obtain the best terms possible.\"<ref name=\"Lipsman and Doyle, p. 127\"/>\n\nDuring the same year, however, he allowed his pro-American minister of defense, General [[Lon Nol]], to crack down on leftist activities, crushing the ''Pracheachon'' by accusing its members of subversion and subservience to [[Hanoi]].<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 85\">Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 85.</ref> Simultaneously, Sihanouk lost the support of Cambodia's conservatives as a result of his failure to come to grips with the deteriorating economic situation (exacerbated by the loss of rice exports, most of which went to the PAVN/Viet Cong) and with the growing communist military presence.{{efn|Beginning in 1966, Cambodians sold 100,000 tons of Cambodian rice to PAVN, who offered the world price and paid in U.S. dollars. The government paid only a low fixed price and thereby lost the taxes and profits that would have been gained. The drop in rice for export (from 583,700 tons in 1965 to 199,049 tons in 1966) elevated an economic crises that grew worse with each passing year.<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 85\"/>}}\n\nOn 11 September 1966, Cambodia held its first open election. Through manipulation and harassment (and to Sihanouk's surprise) the conservatives won 75 percent of the seats in the National Assembly.<ref>Chandler, pp. 153\u2013156.</ref><ref>Osborne, p. 187.</ref> Lon Nol was chosen by the right as prime minister and, as his deputy, they named [[Prince Sirik Matak]]; an ultraconservative member of the Sisowath branch of the royal clan and long-time enemy of Sihanouk.

To maintain the balance against the rising tide of the conservatives, he named the leaders of the very group he had been oppressing as members of a \"counter-government\" that was meant to monitor and criticize Lon Nol's administration.<ref name=\"ihb86\">Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 86.</ref> One of Lon Nol's first priorities was to fix the ailing economy by halting the illegal sale of rice to the communists. Soldiers were dispatched to the rice-growing areas to forcibly collect the harvests at gunpoint, and they paid only the low government price. There was widespread unrest, especially in rice-rich [[Battambang Province]], an area long-noted for the presence of large landowners, great disparity in wealth, and where the communists still had some influence.<ref>Chandler, pp. 164\u2013165.</ref><ref>Osborne, p. 192.</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GenLonNol.jpg|thumb|right|200px|General Lon Nol]] -->\nOn 11 March 1967, while Sihanouk was out of the country in France, a rebellion broke out in the area around Samlaut in Battambang, when enraged villagers attacked a tax collection brigade.

Lon Nol was forced to resign, and, in a typical move, the prince named new leftists to the government to balance the conservatives.<ref name=\"c166\">Chandler, p. 166.</ref> The immediate crisis had passed, but it engendered two tragic consequences. First, it drove thousands of new recruits into the arms of the hard-line ''maquis'' of the Cambodian Communist Party (which Sihanouk labelled the ''[[Khmers rouges]]'' (\"Red Khmers\")). Second, for the peasantry, the name of Lon Nol became associated with ruthless repression throughout Cambodia.<ref>Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 87.</ref>\n\n=== Communist regroupment ===\n{{details|Khmer Rouge}}\n\nWhile the 1967 insurgency had been unplanned, the Khmer Rouge tried, without much success, to organize a more serious revolt during the following year. The prince's decimation of the Prachea Chon and the urban communists had, however, cleared the field of competition for Saloth Sar (also known as [[Pol Pot]]), Ieng Sary, and Son Sen\u2014the [[Maoism|Maoist]] leadership of the ''maquisards''.<ref>Chandler, p. 128.</ref> They led their followers into the highlands of the northeast and into the lands of the [[Khmer Loeu]], a primitive people who were hostile to both the lowland Khmers and the central government. For the Khmer Rouge, who still lacked assistance from the North Vietnamese, it was a period of regroupment, organization, and training. Hanoi basically ignored its Chinese-sponsored allies, and the indifference of their \"fraternal comrades\" to their insurgency between 1967 and 1969 would make an indelible impression on the Khmer Rouge leadership.<ref>Deac, p. 55.</ref><ref>Chandler, p. 141.</ref>\n\nOn 17 January 1968, the Khmer Rouge launched their first offensive. It was aimed more at gathering weapons and spreading propaganda than in seizing territory since, at that time, the adherents of the insurgency numbered no more than 4\u20135,000.<ref name=\"Sutsakhan, p. 32\">Sutsakhan, p. 32.</ref><ref>Chandler, pp. 174\u2013176.</ref> During the same month, the communists established the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea as the military wing of the party. As early as the end of the Battambang revolt, Sihanouk had begun to reevaluate his relationship with the communists.<ref>Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 89.</ref> His earlier agreement with the Chinese had availed him nothing. They had not only failed to restrain the North Vietnamese, but they had actually involved themselves (through the Khmer Rouge) in active subversion within his country.<ref name=\"Lipsman and Doyle, p. 130\" />\nAt the suggestion of Lon Nol (who had returned to the cabinet as defense minister in November 1968) and other conservative politicians, on 11 May 1969, the prince welcomed the restoration of normal diplomatic relations with the U.S. and created a new Government of National Salvation with Lon Nol as his prime minister.<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 90\">Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 90.</ref> He did so \"in order to play a new card, since the Asian communists are already attacking us before the end of the Vietnam War.\"<ref>Lipsman and Doyle, p. 140.</ref> Besides, PAVN and the Viet Cong would make very convenient scapegoats for Cambodia's ills, much more so than the minuscule Khmer Rouge, and ridding Cambodia of their presence would solve many problems simultaneously.<ref>Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 88.</ref>\n\n=== Operation Menu and Operation Freedom Deal ===\nAlthough the U.S. had been aware of the PAVN/Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia since 1966, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had chosen not to attack them due to possible international repercussions and his belief that Sihanouk could be convinced to alter his policies.<ref>Karnow, p. 590.</ref> Johnson did, however, authorize the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group]] (SOG) to enter Cambodia and gather intelligence on the Base Areas in 1967.<ref>Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, ''Command History 1967'', Annex F, Saigon, 1968, p. 4.</ref> The election of [[Richard M. Nixon]] in 1968 and the introduction of his policies of gradual U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and the [[Vietnamization]] of the conflict there, changed everything.\n\nOn 18 March 1969, on secret orders from Nixon and [[Henry Kissinger]], the [[U.S. Air Force]] carried out the bombing of Base Area 353 (in the [[Fishhook (Cambodia)|Fishhook]] region opposite South Vietnam's [[T\u00e2y Ninh Province]]) by 59 [[B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers. This strike was the first in a series of attacks on the sanctuaries that lasted until May 1970. During [[Operation Menu]], the Air Force conducted 3,875 sorties and dropped more than 108,000 tons of ordnance on the eastern border areas.<ref>Nalty, pp. 127\u2013133.</ref> Only five high-ranking Congressional officials were informed of the bombing.<ref>Clymer, Kenton (2004), ''United States and Cambodia: 1969\u20132000'', Routledge, pg. 12.</ref>\n\nAfter the event, it was claimed by Nixon and Kissinger that Sihanouk had given his tacit approval for the raids, but this is dubious.<ref>Shawcross, pps. 68\u201371 & 93\u201394.</ref> Sihanouk told U.S. diplomat [[Chester Bowles]] on 10 January 1968, that he would not oppose American \"hot pursuit\" of retreating North Vietnamese troops \"in remote areas [of Cambodia],\" provided that Cambodians were unharmed. Kenton Clymer notes that this statement \"cannot reasonably be construed to mean that Sihanouk approved of the intensive, ongoing B-52 bombing raids&nbsp;... In any event, no one asked him.&nbsp;...

Under Freedom Deal, from 19 May 1970 to 15 August 1973, U.S. bombing of Cambodia extended over the entire eastern one-half of the country and was especially intense in the heavily populated southeastern one-quarter of the country, including a wide ring surrounding the largest city of Phnom Penh.

Sirik Matak retained his post as deputy prime minister. The new government emphasized that the transfer of power had been totally legal and constitutional and it received the recognition of most foreign governments.

They were dispersed, with many casualties, by contingents of the armed forces.\n\n===Massacre of the Vietnamese===\nMost of the population, urban and rural, took out their anger and frustrations on the nation's Vietnamese population. Lon Nol's call for 10,000 volunteers to boost the manpower of Cambodia's poorly equipped, 30,000-man army, managed to swamp the military with over 70,000 recruits.<ref>Deac, p. 71.</ref> Rumours abounded concerning a possible PAVN offensive aimed at Phnom Penh itself.

In his apology to the [[Saigon]] government, Lon Nol stated that \"it was difficult to distinguish between Vietnamese citizens who were Viet Cong and those who were not. So it is quite normal that the reaction of Cambodian troops, who feel themselves betrayed, is difficult to control.\"<ref>Lipsman and Doyle, p. 146.</ref>\n\n===FUNK and GRUNK===\nFrom Beijing, Sihanouk proclaimed that the government in Phnom Penh was dissolved and his intention to create the ''Front uni national du Kampuch\u00e9a'' ([[National United Front of Kampuchea]]) or FUNK. Sihanouk later said \"I had chosen not to be with either the Americans or the communists, because I considered that there were two dangers, American imperialism and Asian communism. It was Lon Nol who obliged me to choose between them.\"<ref name=\"ld144\"/>\n\nThe North Vietnamese reacted to the political changes in Cambodia by sending Premier [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng]] to meet Sihanouk in China and recruit him into an alliance with the Khmer Rouge. Pol Pot was also contacted by the Vietnamese who now offered him whatever resources he wanted for his insurgency against the Cambodian government. Pol Pot and Sihanouk were actually in Beijing at the same time, but the Vietnamese and Chinese leaders never informed Sihanouk of the presence of Pol Pot or allowed the two men to meet. Shortly after, Sihanouk issued an appeal by radio to the people of Cambodia to rise up against the government and support the Khmer Rouge. In doing so, Sihanouk lent his name and popularity in the rural areas of Cambodia to a movement over which he had little control.<ref>David P. Chandler, ''The Tragedy of Cambodian History'', New Haven CT: Yale University Press, 1991, p. 231.</ref> In May 1970, Pol Pot finally returned to Cambodia and the pace of the insurgency greatly increased. After Sihanouk showed his support for the Khmer Rouge by visiting them in the field, their ranks swelled from 6,000 to 50,000 fighters.\n\nThe prince then allied himself with the Khmer Rouge, the North Vietnamese, the Laotian [[Pathet Lao]] and the Viet Cong, throwing his personal prestige behind the communists. On 5 May, the actual establishment of FUNK and of the ''Gouvernement royal d'union nationale du Kampuch\u00e9a'' or [[GRUNK]] (Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea), was proclaimed. Sihanouk assumed the post of head of state, appointing [[Penn Nouth]], one of his most loyal supporters, as prime minister.<ref name=\"ld144\"/>\n\nKhieu Samphan was designated deputy prime minister, minister of defense, and commander in chief of the GRUNK armed forces (though actual military operations were directed by Pol Pot). Hu Nim became minister of information, and Hou Yuon assumed multiple responsibilities as minister of the interior, communal reforms, and cooperatives. GRUNK claimed that it was not a government-in-exile since Khieu Samphan and the insurgents remained inside Cambodia. Sihanouk and his loyalists remained in China, although the prince did make a visit to the \"liberated areas\" of Cambodia, including [[Angkor Wat]], in March 1973. These visits were used mainly for propaganda purposes and had no real influence on political affairs.<ref>Chandler, pp. 228\u2013229.</ref>\n\nFor Sihanouk, this proved to be a [[marriage of convenience]] that was spurred on by his thirst for revenge against those who had betrayed him.<ref>Chandler, p. 200.</ref><ref>Osborne, pp. 214, 218.</ref> For the Khmer Rouge, it was a means to greatly expand the appeal of their movement. Peasants, motivated by loyalty to the monarchy, gradually rallied to the GRUNK cause.<ref>Chandler, p. 201.</ref> The personal appeal of Sihanouk and widespread US aerial bombardment helped recruitment. This task was made even easier for the communists after 9 October 1970, when Lon Nol abolished the loosely federalist monarchy and proclaimed the establishment of a centralized [[Khmer Republic]].<ref>Chandler, p. 202.</ref>\n\nThe GRUNK was soon caught between the competing Communist powers: North Vietnam, China and the Soviet Union. During the visits that Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] and Sihanouk paid to [[North Korea]] in April and June 1970, respectively, they called for the establishment of a \"united front of the five revolutionary Asian countries\" (China, North Korea, North Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, the last being represented by the GRUNK). While the North Korean leaders enthusiastically welcomed the plan, it soon foundered on Hanoi's opposition. Having realized that such a front would exclude the Soviet Union and implicitly challenge the hegemonic role that the DRV had arrogated to itself in Indochina, the North Vietnamese leaders declared that all communist states should join forces against \"American imperialism.\" Indeed, the issue of Vietnamese versus Chinese hegemony over Indochina greatly influenced the attitude Hanoi adopted towards Moscow in the early and mid-1970s. During the Cambodian civil war, the Soviet leaders, ready to acquiesce in Hanoi's dominance over Laos and Cambodia, actually insisted on sending their aid shipments to the Khmer Rouge through the DRV, whereas China firmly rebuffed Hanoi's proposal that Chinese aid to Cambodia be sent via North Vietnam. Facing Chinese competition and Soviet acquiescence, the North Vietnamese leaders found the Soviet option more advantageous to their interests, a calculation that played a major role in the gradual pro-Soviet shift in Hanoi's foreign policies.<ref>{{cite book|first=Bal\u00e1zs|last=Szalontai|chapter=Political and Economic Relations between Communist States|editor-first=Stephen Anthony|editor-last=Smith |title=Oxford Handbook in the History of Communism|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2014|page=316}}</ref>\n\n==Widening war (1970\u20131971)==\n\n===North Vietnamese offensive in Cambodia===\nIn the wake of the coup, Lon Nol did not immediately launch Cambodia into war.

Cambodia's army was mauled, lands containing nearly half of the Cambodian population were conquered and handed over to the Khmer Rouge and North Vietnam now took an active role in supplying and training the Khmer Rouge. All of this resulted in the Cambodian government being greatly weakened and the insurgents multiplying several fold in size over the course of a few weeks. As noted in the official Vietnamese war history, \"our troops helped our Cambodian friends to completely liberate five provinces with a total population of three million people... our troops also helped our Cambodian friends train cadre and expand their armed forces. In just two months the armed forces of our Cambodian allies grew from ten guerrilla teams to nine battalions and 80 companies of full-time troops with a total strength of 20,000 soldiers, plus hundreds of guerrilla squads and platoons in the villages.\"<ref>\"Victory in Vietnam: The Official History of the People's Army of Vietnam, 1954\u20131975.\" University Press of Kansas, May 2002 (original 1995).

He learned about it only after it had begun from the head of the U.S. mission, who had himself learned about it from a radio broadcast.<ref name=\"k608\"/>\n\nExtensive logistical installations and large amounts of supplies were found and destroyed, but as reporting from the American command in Saigon disclosed, still larger amounts of military material had already been moved further from the border to shelter it from the incursion into Cambodia by the U.S. and South Vietnam.<ref>Deac, p. 79.</ref>\n\nOn the day the incursion was launched, the North Vietnamese launched an offensive (Campaign ''X'') of its own against FANK forces at the request of the Khmer Rouge<ref>Dmitry Mosyakov, \"The Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists: A History of Their\nRelations as Told in the Soviet Archives,\" in Susan E.

Artillery support was provided by the ''69th Artillery Division''.</ref> By June, three months after the removal of Sihanouk, they had swept government forces from the entire northeastern third of the country. After defeating those forces, the North Vietnamese turned the newly won territories over to the local insurgents. The Khmer Rouge also established \"liberated\" areas in the south and the southwestern parts of the country, where they operated independently of the North Vietnamese.<ref name=\"Sutsakhan, p. 32\"/>\n\n===Opposing sides===\nAs combat operations quickly revealed, the two sides were badly mismatched. FANK, whose ranks had been increased by thousands of young urban Cambodians who had flocked to join it in the months following the removal of Sihanouk, had expanded well beyond its capacity to absorb the new men.<ref>Sutsakhan, p. 48.</ref> Later, given the press of tactical operations and the need to replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.<ref>Deac, p. 172.</ref>\nDuring the period 1974\u20131975, FANK forces officially grew from 100,000 to approximately 250,000 men, but probably only numbered around 180,000 due to payroll padding by their officers and due to desertions.<ref>Sutsakhan, p. 39.</ref> U.S. military aid (ammunition, supplies, and equipment) was funneled to FANK through the Military Equipment Delivery Team, Cambodia (MEDTC).

The officer corps of FANK was generally corrupt and greedy.<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 108\">Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 108.</ref> The inclusion of \"ghost\" soldiers allowed massive payroll padding; ration allowances were kept by the officers while their men starved; and the sale of arms and ammunition on the black market (or to the enemy) was commonplace.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 313\u2013315.</ref><ref>Chandler, p. 205.</ref> Worse, the tactical ineptitude among FANK officers was as common as their greed.<ref>General [[Creighton Abrams]], commander of the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] dispatched General Conroy to Phnom Penh to observe the situation and report back. Conroy's conclusions were that the Cambodian officer corps \"had no combat experience...did not know how to run an army nor were they seemingly concerned about their ignorance in the face of the mortal threats that they faced.\" Shaw, p. 137.</ref> Lon Nol frequently bypassed the general staff and directed operations down to battalion-level while also forbidding any real coordination between the army, navy and air force.<ref name=\"Sutsakhan, p. 89\">Sutsakhan, p. 89.</ref>\n\nThe common soldiers fought bravely at first, but they were saddled with low pay (with which they had to purchase their own food and medical care), ammunition shortages, and mixed equipment. Due to the pay system, there were no allotments for their families, who were, therefore, forced to follow their husbands/sons into the battle zones. These problems (exacerbated by continuously declining morale) only increased over time.<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 108\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of 1974, the Cambodian army inventory included 241,630 rifles, 7,079 machine guns, 2,726 mortars, 20,481 grenade launchers, 304 recoilless rifles, 289 howitzers, 202 APCs, and 4,316 trucks. The [[Khmer National Navy|Khmer Navy]] had 171 vessels; the [[Khmer Air Force]] had 211 aircraft, including 64 [[North American T-28 Trojan|North American T-28s]], 14 [[Douglas AC-47 Spooky|Douglas AC-47]] gunships and 44 helicopters. American Embassy military personnel \u2013 who were only supposed to coordinate the arms aid program \u2013 sometimes found themselves involved in prohibited advisory and combat tasks.\n\nWhen PAVN forces were supplanted, it was by the tough, rigidly indoctrinated peasant army of the Khmer Rouge with its core of seasoned leaders, who now received the full support of Hanoi. Khmer Rouge forces, which had been reorganized at an Indochinese summit held in [[Guangzhou]], China in April 1970, would grow from 12\u201315,000 in 1970 to 35\u201340,000 by 1972, when the so-called \"Khmerization\" of the conflict took place and combat operations against the Republic were handed over completely to the insurgents.<ref>Sutsakhan, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\nThe development of these forces took place in three stages. 1970 to 1972 was a period of organization and recruitment, during which Khmer Rouge units served as auxiliaries to the PAVN. From 1972 to mid-1974, the insurgents formed units of battalion and regimental size. It was during this period that the Khmer Rouge began to break away from Sihanouk and his supporters and the collectivization of agriculture was begun in the \"liberated\" areas. Division-sized units were being fielded by 1974\u20131975, when the party was on its own and began the radical transformation of the country.<ref>The evolution of the communist forces is described in Sutsakhan, pp. 78\u201382.</ref>\n\nWith the fall of Sihanouk, Hanoi became alarmed at the prospect of a pro-Western regime that might allow the Americans to establish a military presence on their western flank. To prevent that from happening, they began transferring their military installations away from the border regions to locations deeper within Cambodian territory. A new command center was established at the city of [[Krati\u00e9 (city)|Krati\u00e9]] and the timing of the move was propitious. President Nixon was of the opinion that:\n\n<blockquote>We need a bold move in Cambodia to show that we stand with Lon Nol...something symbolic...for the only Cambodian regime that had the guts to take a pro-Western and pro-American stand.<ref name=\"k608\">Karnow, p. 608.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===''Chenla II''===\n{{details|Operation Chenla II}}\n[[File:Areas of Cambodia under government control August 1970.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Areas under government control, August 1970]]\nDuring the night of 21 January 1971, a force of 100 PAVN/Viet Cong commandos [[Khmer Air Force#The Pochentong raid|attacked]] [[Phnom Penh International Airport|Pochentong airfield]], the main base of the Khmer Air Force. In this one action, the raiders destroyed almost the entire inventory of government aircraft, including all of its fighter planes. This may have been a blessing in disguise, however, since the air force was largely composed of old (even obsolete) Soviet aircraft. The Americans soon replaced the airplanes with more advanced models. The attack did, however, stall a proposed FANK offensive. Two weeks later, Lon Nol suffered a stroke and was evacuated to Hawaii for treatment. It had been a mild stroke, however, and the general recovered quickly, returning to Cambodia after only two months.\n\nIt was not until 20 August that FANK launched Operation Chenla II, its first offensive of the year. The objective of the campaign was to clear Route 6 of enemy forces and thereby reopen communications with [[Kampong Thom City|Kompong Thom]], the Republic's second largest city, which had been isolated from the capital for more than a year. The operation was initially successful, and the city was relieved. The PAVN and Khmer Rouge counterattacked in November and December, annihilating government forces in the process. There was never an accurate count of the losses, but the estimate was \"on the order of ten battalions of personnel and equipment lost plus the equipment of an additional ten battalions.\"<ref>Sutsakhan, p. 79</ref> The strategic result of the failure of ''Chenla II'' was that the offensive initiative passed completely into the hands of PAVN and the Khmer Rouge.\n\n==Agony of the Khmer Republic (1972\u20131975)==\n\n===Struggling to survive===\n{{details|topic=the bombing campaign|Operation Freedom Deal}}\nFrom 1972 through 1974, the war was conducted along FANK's lines of communications north and south of the capital. Limited offensives were launched to maintain contact with the rice-growing regions of the northwest and along the Mekong River and Route 5, the Republic's overland connections to South Vietnam. The strategy of the Khmer Rouge was to gradually cut those lines of communication and squeeze Phnom Penh. As a result, FANK forces became fragmented, isolated, and unable to lend one another mutual support.\n\n[[File:Cambodian Civil War-era T-54 or Type 59.jpg|thumb|left|A memorial to the civil war in [[Siem Reap]], Cambodia, with a rusted wreck of a Soviet-built [[T-54/55|T-54]] main battle tank used during the war.

When President Nixon launched the incursion in 1970, American and South Vietnamese troops operated under an umbrella of air cover that was designated Operation Freedom Deal. When those troops were withdrawn, the air operation continued, ostensibly to interdict PAVN/Viet Cong troop movements and logistics.<ref>Nalty, p. 199.</ref> In reality (and unknown to the U.S. Congress and American public), they were utilized to provide tactical air support to FANK.<ref>Douglas Pike, John Prados, James W.

He then forced Cheng Heng, the head of state since Sihanouk's deposition, to surrender his authority to him. On the second anniversary of the coup, Lon Nol relinquished his authority as head of state, but retained his position as prime minister and defense minister.\n\nOn 4 June, Lon Nol was elected as the first president of the Khmer Republic in a blatantly rigged election.<ref>Chandler, pp. 222\u2013223.</ref> As per the new constitution (ratified on 30 April), political parties formed in the new nation, quickly becoming a source of political factionalism. General Sutsakhan stated: \"the seeds of democratization, which had been thrown into the wind with such goodwill by the Khmer leaders, returned for the Khmer Republic nothing but a poor harvest.\"<ref name=\"Sutsakhan, p. 89\"/>\n\nIn January 1973, hope was renewed when the [[Paris Peace Accords]] were signed, ending the conflict (for the time being) in South Vietnam and Laos. On 29 January, Lon Nol proclaimed a unilateral cease-fire throughout the nation. All U.S. bombing operations were halted in hopes of securing a chance for peace. It was not to be. The Khmer Rouge simply ignored the proclamation and carried on fighting. By March, heavy casualties, desertions, and low recruitment had forced Lon Nol to introduce conscription, and in April insurgent forces launched an offensive that pushed into the suburbs of the capital. The U.S. Air Force responded by launching an intense bombing operation that forced the communists back into the countryside after being decimated by the air strikes.<ref>Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 100.</ref> The US Seventh Air Force argued that the bombing prevented the fall of Phnom Penh in 1973 by killing 16,000 of 25,500 Khmer Rouge fighters besieging the city.<ref>{{cite book|last=Etcheson|first=Craig|title=The Rise and Demise of Democratic Kampuchea|publisher=Westview|year=1984|isbn=0-86531-650-3|page=118}}</ref>\n\nBy the last day of Operation Freedom Deal (15 August 1973), 250,000 tons of bombs had been dropped on the Khmer Republic, 82,000 tons of which had been released in the last 45 days of the operation.<ref>Morrocco, p. 172.</ref> Since the inception of Operation Menu in 1969, the U.S. Air Force had dropped 539,129 tons of ordnance on Cambodia/Khmer Republic.<ref>Shawcross, p. 297.</ref>\n\n===Shape of things to come===\nAs late as 1972\u20131973, it was a commonly held belief, both within and outside Cambodia, that the war was essentially a foreign conflict that had not fundamentally altered the nature of the Khmer people.<ref name=\"ihb106\">Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 106.</ref> By late 1973, there was a growing awareness among the government and population of Cambodia that the extremism, total lack of concern over casualties, and complete rejection of any offer of peace talks \"began to suggest that Khmer Rouge fanaticism and capacity for violence were deeper than anyone had suspected.\"<ref name=\"ihb106\"/>\n\nReports of the brutal policies of the organization soon made their way to Phnom Penh and into the population foretelling the violence that was about to consume the nation. There were tales of the forced relocations of entire villages, of the summary execution of any who disobeyed or even asked questions, the forbidding of religious practices, of monks who were defrocked or murdered, and where traditional sexual and marital habits were foresworn.<ref name=\"Isaacs pp. 106\">Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, pp. 106\u2013107.</ref><ref>Shawcross, p. 322.</ref> War was one thing; the offhand manner in which the Khmer Rouge dealt out death, so contrary to the Khmer character, was quite another.<ref>Osborne, p. 203.</ref> Reports of these atrocities began to surface during the same period in which North Vietnamese troops were withdrawing from the Cambodian battlefields. This was no coincidence.

They were referred to by their fellow countrymen as ''peap prey'' \u2013 the forest army. Previously, the very existence of the communist party as a component of GRUNK had been hidden.<ref name=\"Isaacs pp. 106\"/> Within the \"liberated zones\" it was simply referred to as \"Angka\" \u2013 the organization. During 1973, the communist party fell under the control of its most fanatical members, Pol Pot and Son Sen, who believed that \"Cambodia was to go through a total social revolution and that everything that had preceded it was anathema and must be destroyed.\"<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 107\"/>\n\nAlso hidden from scrutiny was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies.<ref name=\"Isaacs, Hardy and Brown, p. 107\"/><ref>Chandler, p. 216.</ref> The radical leadership of the party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master.<ref>Ideology was not all that separated the two communist groups.

Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.<ref>Chandler, p. 211.</ref>\n\nAs time passed, the need of the Khmer Rouge for the support of Prince Sihanouk lessened.

He said that his hopes for a moderate socialism akin to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]'s must now be totally dismissed. [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Stalinist Albania]], he said, would be the model.<ref>Shawcross, p. 343.</ref>\n\n===Fall of Phnom Penh===\n{{main|Fall of Phnom Penh}}\n{{details|Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia}}\n[[File:Cambodian Civil War map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The final offensive against [[Phnom Penh]] in April 1975]]\n\nBy the time the Khmer Rouge initiated their dry-season offensive to capture the beleaguered Cambodian capital on 1 January 1975, the Republic was in chaos. The economy had been gutted, the transportation network had been reduced to air and waterways, the rice harvest had fallen by one-quarter, and the supply of freshwater fish (the chief source of protein for the country) had declined drastically. The cost of food was 20 times greater than pre-war levels, while unemployment was not even measured anymore.<ref>Lipsman and Weiss, p. 119.</ref>\n\nPhnom Penh, which had a pre-war population of around 600,000, was overwhelmed by refugees (who continued to flood in from the steadily collapsing defense perimeter), growing to a size of around two million. These helpless and desperate civilians had no jobs and little in the way of food, shelter, or medical care. Their condition (and the government's) only worsened when Khmer Rouge forces gradually gained control of the banks of the Mekong. From the riverbanks, their mines and gunfire steadily reduced the river convoys through which 90 percent of the Republic's supplies moved, bringing relief supplies of food, fuel, and ammunition to the slowly starving city from South Vietnam. After the river was effectively blocked in early February, the U.S. began an airlift of supplies into Pochentong Airport. This became increasingly risky, however, due to communist rocket and artillery fire, which constantly rained down on the airfield and city. The Khmer Rouge cut off overland supplies to the city for more than a year before it fell on 17 April 1975. Reports from journalists stated that the Khmer Rouge shelling \"tortured the capital almost continuously,\" inflicting \"random death and mutilation\" on millions of trapped civilians.<ref>[[John Barron (journalist)|Barron, John]] and Anthony Paul (1977), ''Murder of a Gentle Land'', Reader's Digest Press, pp. 1\u20132.</ref>\n\nDesperate but determined units of FANK soldiers, many of whom had run out of ammunition, dug in around the capital and fought until they were overrun as the Khmer Rouge advanced. By the last week of March 1975, approximately 40,000 communist troops had surrounded the capital and began preparing to deliver the ''coup de grace'' to about half as many FANK forces.<ref>Snepp, p. 279.</ref>\n\nLon Nol resigned and left the country on 1 April, hoping that a negotiated settlement might still be possible if he was absent from the political scene.<ref>Deac, p. 218.</ref> [[Saukam Khoy]] became acting president of a government that had less than three weeks to live. Last-minute efforts on the part of the U.S. to arrange a peace agreement involving Sihanouk ended in failure. When a vote in the U.S. Congress for a resumption of American air support failed, panic and a sense of doom pervaded the capital. The situation was best described by General Sak Sutsakhan (now FANK chief of staff):\n\n<blockquote>The picture of the Khmer Republic which came to mind at that time was one of a sick man who survived only by outside means and that, in its condition, the administration of medication, however efficient it might be, was probably of no further value.<ref>Sutsakhan, p. 155.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Saukham Koy arrives on USS Okinawa.jpg|thumb|left|Saukham Khoy, successor to Lon Nol as President of the Khmer Republic arrives on board the {{USS|Okinawa|LPH-3|6}} on 12 April 1975 after being evacuated from Phnom Penh.]]\n\nOn 12 April, concluding that all was lost, the U.S. evacuated its embassy personnel by helicopter during [[Operation Eagle Pull]]. The 276 evacuees included U.S. Ambassador [[John Gunther Dean]], other American diplomatic personnel, [[Acting President]] Saukam Khoy, senior Khmer Republic government officials and their families, and members of the news media.

Their names were not published on the death lists and many trusted the Khmer Rouge's assertions that former government officials would not be murdered, but would be welcome in helping to rebuild a new Cambodia.\n\nAfter the Americans (and Saukam Khoy) had departed, a seven-member Supreme Committee, headed by General Sak Sutsakhan, assumed authority over the collapsing Republic. By 15 April, the last solid defenses of the city were overcome by the communists. In the early morning hours of 17 April, the committee decided to move the seat of government to [[Oddar Meanchey Province]] in the northwest. Around 10:00, the voice of General Mey Si Chan of the FANK general staff broadcast on the radio, ordering all FANK forces to cease firing, since \"negotiations were in progress\" for the surrender of Phnom Penh.<ref>Ponchaud, p. 7.</ref> The war was over, but the sinister plans of the Khmer Rouge were about to come to fruition in the newly proclaimed [[Democratic Kampuchea]].
