One issue with opioid rotation is that an opioid therapy failure poorly predicts whether other opioids would be effective. In certain situations, multiple switches may be required before pain therapy is optimized.<ref>Fine, Perry G, and Russell K Portenoy. \u201cStrategies for Opioid Rotation: Decision Support in Chronic Pain Management.\u201d Medscape, Medscape, 30 Mar. 2010, www.medscape.org/viewarticle/717832.</ref> In addition, recent studies explore which opioid drugs are most effective in implementing in an opioid rotation, but have so far found no difference in efficacy between opioid drugs like methadone and fentanyl in cancer patients.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1089/jpm.2017.0301 | volume=20 | title=Response to the Article \"Overall Survival among Cancer Patients Undergoing Opioid Rotation to Methadone Compared to Other Opioids\" | year=2017 | journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine | pages=1184\u20131185 | last1 = van den Beuken-van Everdingen | first1 = Marieke H.J. | last2 = van Kuijk | first2 = Sander M.J. | last3 = Joosten | first3 = Elbert A.}}</ref>\n\nDiversion of prescribed opioid drugs for illicit recreational use is also a particular concern in this field, as the drugs which are most effective for relieving [[suffering]] in [[palliative care]] also tend to be those most sought after by [[Substance abuse|drug abusers]].

One issue with opioid rotation is that an opioid therapy failure poorly predicts whether other opioids would be effective. In certain situations, multiple switches may be required before pain therapy is optimized.<ref>Fine, Perry G, and Russell K Portenoy. \u201cStrategies for Opioid Rotation: Decision Support in Chronic Pain Management.\u201d Medscape, Medscape, 30 Mar. 2010, www.medscape.org/viewarticle/717832.</ref> In addition, recent studies explore which opioid drugs are most effective in implementing in an opioid rotation, but have so far found no difference in efficacy between opioid drugs like methadone and fentanyl in cancer patients.<ref>hvan den Beuken-van Everdingen Marieke H.J., van Kuijk Sander M.J., and Joosten Elbert A..

The first member of the class was indigenously designed and built by [[Chittaranjan Locomotive Works|CLW]] in 1970. The class was produced until 1983.\n\nThe locomotives in the class feature [[rheostatic braking]], and MU capability. They use the same [[power bogie]]s as the successful [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]] class of [[diesel-electric]] locomotives. Being designed specially for mixed traffic, the WAM-4 class has rendered excellent service.\nNow, most of these are used exclusively for passenger traffic.\nThis class proved so successful by virtue of its ruggedness suitable for Indian conditions and simplicity of maintenance, that IR used this basic design for a number of other locos later (WCAM-1, WAG-5A, WCG-2, and some WAP models). A single WAM-4 can generally haul up to a 24-coach passenger rake. However, with the advent of new 3-phase locos like WAP - 5 and WAP - 7, the WAM - 4 locomotives were relegated to hauling smaller passenger trains. Also, due to the aging fleet the WAM - 4 locomotives are being rapidly scrapped and withdrawn from mainline duties.\n\nThis loco class has been seen in many variations, as a lot of workshops and sheds have carried out their own enhancements or modifications to the basic loco design. This loco has the widest variety of liveries, with each loco shed having its own livery.\nAlthough the code indicates a mixed-use loco, most WAM-4's ended up hauling passenger trains. They have been used for regularly hauling freight only in a few locations (Arakkonam - Renigunta, Kirandul-Kottavalasa and other SER sections). Max. speed 110&nbsp;km/h.Variants include WAM-4P D (dual brakes), WAM-4P R (??), WAM-4P DB 6P, WAM-4 6P DB HS, and WAM-4 6P D (these are for superfast trains), WAM-4P DB 3P and WAM-4 2S-3P (some superfasts, passengers), and WAM-4P DB 4P (generally for stopping passengers). The 'DB' or 'D' generally, but perhaps not always, indicates dual-brake capability. 'HS' may be for 'high speed'.'2S', '3P', '6P', etc. indicate traction motors connected in series or parallel. The WAM-4 has six traction motors, and originally they were wired to be available in different configurations at different power settings. At notches up to 14, all motors were in series (at notch 14 all resistors dropping out); up to notch 21 in series-parallel combinations (three pairs of motors in series, the pairs themselves being in parallel); and further notches with all motors in parallel (at notch 30 all motors are in parallel with resistors dropping out). This is the original configuration of the WCAM-x series of locos too. The WAM-4 locos were later reconfigured to have all motors always in parallel (6P variants) or with the three series-connected pairs in parallel (2S 3P variants). Some WAM-4 locos from CLW are thought to have had the 2S 3P configuration right from the start. The 2S 3P configuration was better for the mixed traffic loads especially as it allowed the locos to start hauling larger loads without stalling. With increasing use of the WAM-4 locos for passenger traffic the all-parallel configuration was deemed more desirable since it allowed higher speeds and higher acceleration.\n\nMost of the WAM-4 locos now have their MU capability disabled as [[Research Design and Standards Organization|RDSO]] disapproves of these locos running MU'd over 100&nbsp;km/h.\n<ref>http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html</ref>\n\n==Loco Sheds still holding WAM-4.==\n*'''Loco Shed Asansol-''' 3\n*'''Loco Shed Ghaziabad-''' 1\n*'''Loco Shed Ludhiana-''' 1\n*'''Loco Shed Jhansi-''' 1\n*'''Loco Shed Kanpur-''' 3\n*'''Loco Shed Tatanagar-''' 4\n*'''Loco Shed Bhilai-''' 4<br/ >In total 17 locomotives as of 01-03-2020 are there but 9 of them are overaged condemned and 8 of them are inferior in service.\n('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n<br/ >'''Source:''' http://elocos.railnet.gov.in/\n\n==Technical specifications<ref>[http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html#loco Indian AC electric loco information]</ref>==\n{| class=wikitable\n|Traction Motors\n|Alstom TAO 659 A1 (575&nbsp;kW, 750 V).

The class was produced until 1983.\n\nThe locomotives in the class feature [[rheostatic braking]], and MU capability. They use the same [[power bogie]]s as the successful [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]] class of [[diesel-electric]] locomotives. Being designed specially for mixed traffic, the WAM-4 class has rendered excellent service.\nNow, most of these are used exclusively for passenger traffic.\nThis class proved so successful by virtue of its ruggedness suitable for Indian conditions and simplicity of maintenance, that IR used this basic design for a number of other locos later (WCAM-1, WAG-5A, WCG-2, and some WAP models). A single WAM-4 can generally haul up to a 24-coach passenger rake. However, with the advent of new 3-phase locos like WAP - 5 and WAP - 7, the WAM - 4 locomotives were relegated to hauling smaller passenger trains. Also, due to the aging fleet the WAM - 4 locomotives are being rapidly scrapped and withdrawn from mainline duties.\n\nThis loco class has been seen in many variations, as a lot of workshops and sheds have carried out their own enhancements or modifications to the basic loco design. This loco has the widest variety of liveries, with each loco shed having its own livery.\nAlthough the code indicates a mixed-use loco, most WAM-4's ended up hauling passenger trains. They have been used for regularly hauling freight only in a few locations (Arakkonam - Renigunta, Kirandul-Kottavalasa and other SER sections). Max. speed 110&nbsp;km/h.Variants include WAM-4P D (dual brakes), WAM-4P R (??), WAM-4P DB 6P, WAM-4 6P DB HS, and WAM-4 6P D (these are for superfast trains), WAM-4P DB 3P and WAM-4 2S-3P (some superfasts, passengers), and WAM-4P DB 4P (generally for stopping passengers). The 'DB' or 'D' generally, but perhaps not always, indicates dual-brake capability. 'HS' may be for 'high speed'.'2S', '3P', '6P', etc. indicate traction motors connected in series or parallel. The WAM-4 has six traction motors, and originally they were wired to be available in different configurations at different power settings. At notches up to 14, all motors were in series (at notch 14 all resistors dropping out); up to notch 21 in series-parallel combinations (three pairs of motors in series, the pairs themselves being in parallel); and further notches with all motors in parallel (at notch 30 all motors are in parallel with resistors dropping out). This is the original configuration of the WCAM-x series of locos too. The WAM-4 locos were later reconfigured to have all motors always in parallel (6P variants) or with the three series-connected pairs in parallel (2S 3P variants). Some WAM-4 locos from CLW are thought to have had the 2S 3P configuration right from the start. The 2S 3P configuration was better for the mixed traffic loads especially as it allowed the locos to start hauling larger loads without stalling. With increasing use of the WAM-4 locos for passenger traffic the all-parallel configuration was deemed more desirable since it allowed higher speeds and higher acceleration.\n\nMost of the WAM-4 locos now have their MU capability disabled as [[Research Design and Standards Organization|RDSO]] disapproves of these locos running MU'd over 100&nbsp;km/h.\n<ref>http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html</ref>\n\n==Loco Sheds still holding WAM-4.==\n*'''Loco Shed Asansol-''' 3\n*'''Loco Shed Ghaziabad-''' 1\n*'''Loco Shed Ludhiana-''' 1\n*'''Loco Shed Jhansi-''' 1\n*'''Loco Shed Kanpur-''' 3\n*'''Loco Shed Tatanagar-''' 4\n*'''Loco Shed Bhilai-''' 4<br/ >In total 17 locomotives as of 01-03-2020 are there but 9 of them are overaged condemned and 8 of them are inferior in service.\n('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n<br/ >'''Source:''' http://elocos.railnet.gov.in/\n\n==Image Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"150\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:VSKP-Nanded Express exits Moula Ali.jpg|WAM 4 series loco 20491 from Vadodara Shed VSKP-Nanded Express\nFile:WAM4 loco at Moulaali.jpg|WAM 4 series loco 21226 from Visakhapatnam Shed spotted at [[Moula-Ali|Moula Ali]]\nFile:WAM 4 series loco at Visakhapatnam.jpg|WAM 4 series loco 21219 from [[Arakkonam]] Shed spotted at [[Visakhapatnam Junction]]\nFile:13022 (Raxaul-Howrah) Mithila Express 01.jpg|13022 (Raxaul - [[Howrah Junction railway station|Howrah]]) Mithila Express with [[Howrah Junction railway station|HWH]] WAM 4 21281 based at katni shed\nFile:A WAM-4 class Locomotive at Secunderabad.jpg|WAM-4P loco of [[Vijayawada Junction railway station|Vijayawada]] Shed spotted at [[Secunderabad Junction railway station|Secunderabad]]\nFile:WAM 4 with the Malwa Express.jpg|WAM 4 with the [[Malwa Express]]\nFile:12295 (SBC-PNBE) Sanghamitra Express 01.jpg|12295 (SBC-PNBE) Sanghamitra Express from [[Mughalsarai]] Shed\nFile:Howrah bound 12814 (Tatanagar-Howrah) Steel Express.jpg|Howrah bound 12814 (Tatanagar-Howrah) Steel Express with WAM4 series loco of Tata shed\n</gallery>\n\n==Technical specifications<ref>[http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html#loco Indian AC electric loco information]</ref>==\n{| class=wikitable\n|Traction Motors\n|Alstom TAO 659 A1 (575&nbsp;kW, 750 V).

Founded in 1906, the club was the first professional hockey team in Toronto.]]\nThe city is known for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]], a team with passionate support in the city, and the most financially successful sports franchise in the country.  The team built Maple Leaf Gardens, a sporting venue which served as the home arena for the Maple Leafs, and was also used for cultural and other events.  Since 1999, they have played in the [[Scotiabank Arena]] (initially referred to as the Air Canada Centre).  The team's roots stretch back to the [[Toronto Blueshirts]] of the [[National Hockey Association]], the predecessor to the NHL.  The NHA was founded in 1909 without any teams from Toronto. In 1911, the [[Mutual Street Arena|Arena Gardens]] was being built and [[Ambrose O'Brien]], who had operated four NHA franchises but decided to get out of the business, sold two of his franchises to Toronto-based groups.  The Toronto Hockey Club purchased one, which would become known as the Blueshirts, and a second was sold to a group affiliated with the Tecumseh Lacrosse Club for $500 cash and promissory notes for $2,000 which would be called the [[Toronto Tecumsehs]].  They were scheduled to begin play in the 1911-12 season, but construction delays led to the two Toronto teams being dropped from the schedule and they instead began play in 1912\u201313.\n\nAfter a year of play, the Tecumsehs were sold and renamed the [[Toronto Ontarios]].  The following year the team was purchased by [[Eddie Livingstone]], who renamed them the Toronto Shamrocks in January 1915.  Later that year, Livingstone purchased the Blueshirts giving him ownership of two NHA teams, but after the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] raids left him with only enough players for one team, he transferred Shamrocks players to the Blueshirts and only the Blueshirts competed in the [[1915\u201316 NHA season]]. When Livingstone failed to sell the Shamrocks, the NHA seized the franchise, which was left dormant for the year before being reactivated in [[1916\u201317 NHA season|1916\u201317]], awarding it to a Canadian military team, the [[Toronto 228th Battalion (NHA)|Toronto 228th Battalion]]. When the regiment was ordered overseas in February 1917, the team was forced to withdraw.  That left the NHA with an odd number of teams, and as a result, the team owners, who wanted Livingstone out of the league, decided to suspend operations of the Blueshirts for the remainder of the season. Following the end of the season, Toronto was reinstated, with the condition that the club was to be sold within 60 days. However, Livingstone obtained a court order to prevent the sale.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=March 19, 1917 |title=Suit Against N.H.A. Clubs |page=16}}</ref>\n[[File:Collegesubwayleafsmural.jpg|thumb|left|A Toronto Maple Leafs mural on the southbound side of [[College station (Toronto)|College subway station]], the nearest station to [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], the previous Maple Leafs' home arena.]]\nBefore the start of the 1917\u201318 season, the NHA owners announced that the league would not operate in the 1917\u201318 season. About two weeks later, all of the owners except Livingstone announced that they were creating a new league, the National Hockey League.  Livingstone was not invited to participate in the new league.  However, the other teams wished to continue a team in Toronto, and also needed a fourth team to balance the schedule.  Accordingly, Livingstone's landlord, the Toronto Arena Company, was given a temporary franchise in the NHL and leased Livingstone's Torontos players for the inaugural [[1917\u201318 NHL season]].{{sfn|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|p=157}}  Although the team had no official name, it was made up mostly of former Blue Shirts and as a result, the newspapers still called the team the Blue Shirts or the Torontos, as they always had.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Toronto Blue Shirts a.k.a.

Instead, before the [[1918\u201319 NHL season|1918\u201319 season]], it formed a new club, which was known as the [[Toronto Arenas]].{{sfn |Holzman |Nieforth |2002 |pp=197\u2013198}} This new franchise was separated from the Arena Company. The dispute with Livingstone forced the Arena Company into bankruptcy.  The Arenas were sold to a group headed by [[Charles Querrie]] for $5000, who renamed them the [[Toronto St. Patricks]].  In 1927, with the team in trouble financially due to Querrie having lost a lawsuit to former Livingstone, Querrie put the St. Pats up for sale and agreed in principle to sell them for $200,000 to a group that would move the team to [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=thoughages>{{cite web|url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2010/12/01/maple-leafs-owners-through-the-ages/|title=Maple Leafs' owners through the ages|last=Sandler|first=Jeremy|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=December 1, 2010|accessdate=March 19, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140320041448/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2010/12/01/maple-leafs-owners-through-the-ages/|archivedate=March 20, 2014}}</ref>  However, [[Conn Smythe]] persuaded Querrie that civic pride was more important than money and put together a syndicate that bought the St. Pats.

The Argos also draw the highest per-game attendance of any sports team in Toronto and draw the second highest per-game TV ratings nationally of any Toronto-based sports team (after the Maple Leafs hockey club).

Founded in 1906, the club was the first professional hockey team in Toronto.]]\nThe city is known for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]], a team with passionate support in the city, and the most financially successful sports franchise in the country.  The team built Maple Leaf Gardens, a sporting venue which served as the home arena for the Maple Leafs, and was also used for cultural and other events.  Since 1999, they have played in the [[Scotiabank Arena]] (initially referred to as the Air Canada Centre).  The team's roots stretch back to the [[Toronto Blueshirts]] of the [[National Hockey Association]], the predecessor to the NHL.  The NHA was founded in 1909 without any teams from Toronto. In 1911, the [[Mutual Street Arena|Arena Gardens]] was being built and [[Ambrose O'Brien]], who had operated four NHA franchises but decided to get out of the business, sold two of his franchises to Toronto-based groups.  The Toronto Hockey Club purchased one, which would become known as the Blueshirts, and a second was sold to a group affiliated with the Tecumseh Lacrosse Club for $500 cash and promissory notes for $2,000 which would be called the [[Toronto Tecumsehs]].  They were scheduled to begin play in the 1911-12 season, but construction delays led to the two Toronto teams being dropped from the schedule and they instead began play in 1912\u201313.\n\nAfter a year of play, the Tecumsehs were sold and renamed the [[Toronto Ontarios]].  The following year the team was purchased by [[Eddie Livingstone]], who renamed them the Toronto Shamrocks in January 1915.  Later that year, Livingstone purchased the Blueshirts giving him ownership of two NHA teams, but after the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] raids left him with only enough players for one team, he transferred Shamrocks players to the Blueshirts and only the Blueshirts competed in the [[1915\u201316 NHA season]]. When Livingstone failed to sell the Shamrocks, the NHA seized the franchise, which was left dormant for the year before being reactivated in [[1916\u201317 NHA season|1916\u201317]], awarding it to a Canadian military team, the [[Toronto 228th Battalion (NHA)|Toronto 228th Battalion]]. When the regiment was ordered overseas in February 1917, the team was forced to withdraw.  That left the NHA with an odd number of teams, and as a result, the team owners, who wanted Livingstone out of the league, decided to suspend operations of the Blueshirts for the remainder of the season. Following the end of the season, Toronto was reinstated, with the condition that the club was to be sold within 60 days. However, Livingstone obtained a court order to prevent the sale.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=March 19, 1917 |title=Suit Against N.H.A.

About two weeks later, all of the owners except Livingstone announced that they were creating a new league, the National Hockey League.  Livingstone was not invited to participate in the new league.  However, the other teams wished to continue a team in Toronto, and also needed a fourth team to balance the schedule.  Accordingly, Livingstone's landlord, the Toronto Arena Company, was given a temporary franchise in the NHL and leased Livingstone's Torontos players for the inaugural [[1917\u201318 NHL season]].{{sfn|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|p=157}}  Although the team had no official name, it was made up mostly of former Blue Shirts and as a result, the newspapers still called the team the Blue Shirts or the Torontos, as they always had.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Toronto Blue Shirts a.k.a.

Instead, before the [[1918\u201319 NHL season|1918\u201319 season]], it formed a new club, which was known as the [[Toronto Arenas]].{{sfn |Holzman |Nieforth |2002 |pp=197\u2013198}} This new franchise was separated from the Arena Company. The dispute with Livingstone forced the Arena Company into bankruptcy.  The Arenas were sold to a group headed by [[Charles Querrie]] for $5000, who renamed them the [[Toronto St. Patricks]].  In 1927, with the team in trouble financially due to Querrie having lost a lawsuit to former Livingstone, Querrie put the St. Pats up for sale and agreed in principle to sell them for $200,000 to a group that would move the team to [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=thoughages>{{cite web|url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2010/12/01/maple-leafs-owners-through-the-ages/|title=Maple Leafs' owners through the ages|last=Sandler|first=Jeremy|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=December 1, 2010|accessdate=March 19, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140320041448/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2010/12/01/maple-leafs-owners-through-the-ages/|archivedate=March 20, 2014}}</ref>  However, [[Conn Smythe]] persuaded Querrie that civic pride was more important than money and put together a syndicate that bought the St. Pats.

However, with the Ricoh Coliseum vacated, a new tenant for the facility was found with the Maple Leafs relocating their AHL farm team, the [[St. John's Maple Leafs]], from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] to Toronto as the [[Toronto Marlies]] in 2005.\n\nToronto has also hosted various international hockey tournaments: hosting parts of the [[Summit Series|1972]] and [[1974 Summit Series]]; parts of the [[1976 Canada Cup|1976]] and [[1991 Canada Cup]]s; parts of the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]] & all of the [[2016 World Cup of Hockey|2016 edition]]; and parts of the [[2015 World Junior Ice Hockey Championship|2015]] & [[2017 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]].\n\nParticipation in [[minor hockey]] is very popular.

Balearic slingers would use hardened leather shields tied to an arm in order to leave both hands free to use their slings.<ref name=Daly/>\n\nDespite their light armor, which should force them to trust on strategy over all out assault, Hispanic infantry is also described as fearsome even in the front lines.<ref name=Enem>Fernando Quesada Sanz, [https://www.uam.es/proyectosinv/equus/warmas/online/Quesada%202015%20Iberians%20as%20enemies.pdf Iberians as enemies], 2015</ref> Iberians and Celtiberians occupied comfortably the vanguard of Hannibal's army at the [[Battle of Cannae]], divided in ''speirai'' (units similar to Roman [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]]) and side to side to his Gaulish contingent, while Balearic slingers supported them from behind.<ref name=Enem/> Even [[Lusitanians]], commonly known as ambushers and riders, are quoted to stand out for their ferocity and battle skill.

During the [[Second Punic War]], riders from Celtiberia, Lusitania and [[Vettones|Vettonia]] were used by [[Hannibal]] as heavy cavalry, in stark contrast to the more famed [[Numidian cavalry|Numidian skirmishing cavalry]].<ref name=Daly/> Among them is mentioned a unit from the Celtiberian city of [[Uxama]], whose riders wore helmets with jaws of beasts to scare their enemies away.<ref name=SiliusI>[[Silius Italicus]], ''[[Punica (poem)|Punica]]'', 3, 384</ref> Due to their performance at the battles of [[Battle of the Trebia|Trebia]] and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], Livy would even state that Hispanic cavalry was superior to any other in the war.<ref name=Arma/><ref name=Enem/> This eventually led the Roman military to ask for their own horsemen to the Celtiberian cities under their domain, using them to counter their Carthaginian homologues and exerting [[psychological warfare]] on them.<ref name=Ap30>[[Appian]], ''The Punic Wars'', 30</ref>\n\nAfter the Punic Wars and the Roman conquest of Hispania, Roman military acquired peninsular horses and riders as [[auxiliaries]].

The citizens surrendered and exited Salmantica, but the women did so while carrying swords hidden in their clothes.

They were taught from childhood to use accurately slings of several sizes, and employed them to throw stones heavier than many other slingmen of the time, weighing around 1 [[Mina (unit)|mina]] (15.3 ounces/436g) every shot.<ref name=Daly/> Most other peninsular tribes preferred smaller lead bullets as slingshot.<ref name=Arma/><ref name=Daly/> The [[bow and arrow]] was very rarely used, if at all, and possibly limited to [[hunting]].<ref>Fernando Quesada Sanz, ''La utilizaci\u00f3n del arco y las flechas en la cultura ib\u00e9rica''</ref>\n\nHowever, Spaniard [[swordsman|swordsmen]] are acknowledged more often than ranged fighters in chronicles due to their toughness and lethal effect.

Balearic slingers would use hardened leather shields tied to an arm in order to leave both hands free to use their slings.<ref name=Daly/>\n\nDespite their light armor, which should force them to trust on strategy over all out assault, Hispanic infantry is also described as fearsome even in the front lines.<ref name=Enem>Fernando Quesada Sanz, [https://www.uam.es/proyectosinv/equus/warmas/online/Quesada%202015%20Iberians%20as%20enemies.pdf Iberians as enemies], 2015</ref> Iberians and Celtiberians occupied comfortably the vanguard of Hannibal's army at the [[Battle of Cannae]], divided in ''speirai'' (units similar to Roman [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]]) and side to side to his Gaulish contingent, while Balearic slingers supported them from behind.<ref name=Enem/> Even [[Lusitanians]], commonly known as ambushers and riders, are quoted to stand out for their ferocity and battle skill.

Chronicles continually extol [[Spanish Horse|Spanish horses]], describing them as fast, strong and well tamed. They were accustomed to climb mountainous roads, easily leaving behind their [[List of Italian horse breeds|Italic homologues]], and were also taught to obey their owners and wait for them if dismounted in midst of the battlefield. This was a custom of [[Ilergetes|Ilergete]] and Celtiberian cavalrymen, as they often dismounted to fight on their feet at a possible tactical necessity, relegating their mounts as ways to retreat quickly.<ref name=Arma/> Another tactic favored in Hispania saw riders carrying a second warrior in their horses, who they would deploy to form contingents of footsoldiers before extracting them from the battlefield the same way.<ref name=Arma/> Others would use [[shock troops]] tactics, wearing armor and wielding spears and heavy shields.<ref name=Daly>{{cite book|author=Gregory Daly|title=Cannae: The Experience of Battle in the Second Punic War|url=|date=August 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 978-11-345071-2-2|page=|language=}}</ref>\n\nSpanish horsemen worked as mercenaries first by Carthage and later by Rome. During the [[Second Punic War]], riders from Celtiberia, Lusitania and [[Vettones|Vettonia]] were used by [[Hannibal]] as heavy cavalry, in stark contrast to the more famed [[Numidian cavalry|Numidian skirmishing cavalry]].<ref name=Daly/> Among them is mentioned a unit from the Celtiberian city of [[Uxama]], whose riders wore helmets with jaws of beasts to scare their enemies away.<ref name=SiliusI>[[Silius Italicus]], ''[[Punica (poem)|Punica]]'', 3, 384</ref> Due to their performance at the battles of [[Battle of the Trebia|Trebia]] and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], Livy would even state that Hispanic cavalry was superior to any other in the war.<ref name=Arma/><ref name=Enem/> This eventually led the Roman military to ask for their own horsemen to the Celtiberian cities under their domain, using them to counter their Carthaginian homologues and exerting [[psychological warfare]] on them.<ref name=Ap30>[[Appian]], ''The Punic Wars'', 30</ref>\n\nAfter the Punic Wars and the Roman conquest of Hispania, Roman military acquired peninsular horses and riders as [[auxiliaries]]. Particularly famous examples are found in the late [[Ala (Roman allied military unit)|alae quinquagenaria]], which contained three [[Astur]] ''Ala Asturum'' forces, two [[Arevaci]] ''Ala Arevacorum'' and a famed Vetton contingent named ''Ala Hispanorum Vettonum''.\n\n===Strategy and tactics===\n[[File:Viriato, de Eugenio Oliva y Rodrigo.jpg|thumb|180px|Viriathus armed with lance and shield.]]\nThe style of warfare in Hispania was usually tied to the way of living of the tribes employing them. Wealthy peoples like Iberians and Celtiberians engaged in conventional [[pitched battle]]s in close formation, often in [[Flying wedge|wedge]], while less developed tribes like Lusitanians and Cantabrians favored [[guerrilla warfare]], [[surprise attack]]s and [[ambush]]es.<ref name=Enem/><ref name=Proto>{{cite book|author=Joaqu\u00edn G\u00f3mez-Pantoja, Eduardo S\u00e1nchez Moreno|title=Protohistoria y Antig\u00fcedad de la Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica II|url=|date=2007|publisher=S\u00edlex Ediciones|isbn=978-84-773718-2-3|page=|language= Spanish}}</ref> The pitched battle style was extensively used, but not superlatively, given that it usually fared poorly against the better organized, disciplined Roman legions and Carthaginian armies.<ref name=Devel>Fernando Quesada Sanz, [https://www.uam.es/proyectosinv/equus/warmas/online/Quesada%20HWI%20Torun%20BNO%20.pdf Military developments in the 'Late Iberian' culture (c. 237-c. 195 BC)]</ref> However, during the Roman conquest of Spain, Viriathus elevated the guerrilla style to its maximum measure of success against the invading forces, which prompted its idealization in modern times and its extrapolation to virtually all the peninsular peoples.<ref name=Proto/><ref name=Pidal>{{cite book|author=[[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]]|title=Historia de Espa\u00f1a: Espa\u00f1a romana|url=|date=1962|publisher=Espasa Calpe|isbn=|page=|language= Spanish}}</ref> In any case, that Hispania contained quality strategists is a fact agreed by ancient authors, especially [[Frontinus]].<ref name=Arma/> Viriathus himself was called \"the [[Barbarian]] [[Hannibal]]\" by [[Lucilius]].<ref name=Vila/>\n\nA particular tactic made famous by [[Caesarus]] and Viriathus was called ''concursare'' (\"bustling\"), where his forces would charge against the enemy lines, only for them to stop and retreat after a brief clash or without engaging at all. This technique would be repeated as many times as needed in order to goad the opposing force into giving chase, which would be capitalized on to lead them to ambushes and new sudden attacks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gonzalo Barrientos Alfageme, Angel Rodr\u00edguez S\u00e1nchez|title=Historia de Extremadura: La geograf\u00eda de los tiempos antiguos|url=|date=1985|publisher=Universitas Editorial|isbn=978-84-855834-5-4|page=|language= Spanish}}</ref> The method of turning pursuers into pursued, often described by modern authors as \"turn and fight,\"<ref name=Lopez>{{cite book|author=Toni \u00d1aco del Hoyo, Fernando L\u00f3pez S\u00e1nchez|title=War, Warlords, and Interstate Relations in the Ancient Mediterranean|url=|date=2017|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-043540-5-0|page=}}</ref> was a specialty of Lusitanians, who used it even when their retreat was genuine.<ref name=Vila/> It was also praised the way in which Hispanic warriors combined and transitioned between cavalry and infantry.

While making incursions through [[Lusitania]], [[Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus|Decimus Junius Brutus]] found female fighters defending their cities among the men, \"with such bravery that they uttered no cry even in the midst of slaughter.\"<ref name=Pidal/> This custom was also recorded about the [[Bracari]], whose women would fight against Brutus \"never turning, never never showing their backs, or uttering a cry.\" They would prefer death to captivity, even killing their own children before killing themselves.<ref name=Pidal/> [[Gallaeci]] were also described as going to war along with their wives.\n\nIn an outstanding chapter, [[Salamanca|Salmantine]] women assisted to break the siege of their city against the Carthaginian army. The citizens surrendered and exited Salmantica, but the women did so while carrying swords hidden in their clothes. Once the Punics were distracted, the women armed the men and themselves and attacked. Taking the Punics by surprise, the natives managed to retreat to the mountains, and this impressed Hannibal so much that he gave them immunity and human treatment.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Chrystal|title=Women at War in the Classical World|url=|date=2017|publisher=Grub Street Publishers|isbn=978-14-738566-1-5|page=}}</ref> Iberian women also assisted in the defense of [[Illiturgis]] against [[Scipio Africanus]]'s army.<ref>[[Livy]], ''The History of Rome'', Volumen 2</ref>\n[[File:Balearic Slinger.jpg|thumb|170px|A Balearic slinger.]]\n\n===As mercenaries===\n{{Main|Mercenaries of the ancient Iberian peninsula}}\n[[Mercenary]] life is recorded as a custom of [[Iron Age]] Spain, particularly in the central area of the Iberian peninsula.
