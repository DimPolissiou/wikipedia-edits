Fleck stated that the statistic was \"somewhat misleading\" since it measured the performances of economically disadvantaged pupils in the [[Texas Assessment of Academic Skills]] (TAAS); Fleck said that the ranking was \"a major embarrassment for the school district and served to underscore the gap between the children of affluent white parents and minority students that the Rice School was designed to bridge.\"<ref name=\"Fleck1\"/>\n\nMcAdams wrote that the divide in terms of class and neighborhood origins between the White affluent parents and the low income Black and Hispanic parents were more significant than the differences in ethnicity, and the differences contributed to the decline of the school.<ref name=McAdamsp53>McAdams, p.

The construction is described in the Byzantine historian [[Procopius]]' ''On Buildings'' (''Peri ktismat\u014dn'', Latin: ''De aedificiis''). Columns and other marbles were brought from all over the empire, throughout the Mediterranean. The idea of these columns being spoils from cities such as Rome and Ephesus is a later invention.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Krautheimer|first1=Richard|title=Early Christian and Byzantine Architecture|date=1986|publisher=Yale University Press/Pelican History of Art|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-05296-1|page=205|edition=4th}}</ref> Even though they were made specifically for Hagia Sophia, the columns show variations in size.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mango|first1=Cyril|title=Byzantine Architecture|date=1985|publisher=Electa/Rizzoli|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8478-0615-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/byzantinearchite0000mang/page/65 65]|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/details/byzantinearchite0000mang/page/65}}</ref> More than ten thousand people were employed. This new church was contemporaneously recognized as a major work of architecture. The theories of [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron of Alexandria]] may have been utilized to address the challenges presented by building such an expansive dome over so large a space.<ref>Helge Svenson 2010: Das Bauwerk als \u00bbAistheton Soma\u00ab - Eine Neuinterpretation der Hagia Sophia im Spiegel antiker Vermessungslehre und angewandter Mathematik.

This is appropriate for 22/7 which was used for solving circle problems in construction. When it is ascertained that the circle circumference is U=D*22/7, several elegant solutions are produced, among them those which use a diameter which is cancelling the denominator. As thus Svenhon and Stiffel proposed that the architects used Heron's proposed values for constructing vaults. Central for the erection of the dome of the Hagia Sophia was that the central square corresponds to a diagonal, which is expressible as a rational number approximating <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>. If this was not rightly done, all related measures to the square would not be manageable by the instruments of the surveyors of those times. As thus for the calculation of the square measurements derived from the so-called side-and-diagonal number progression were used. With its help, approximations for <math>\\sqrt{2}</math> can be produced, which is essential for measuring all types of square or square-related objects and surfaces (i.e. 1/1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70). With this method, the squares defined by the numbers 12 and 17, whereas 12 defines the side of the square and 17 its diagonal, has been used as a standard value as early as in cuneiform Babylonian texts.<ref>Svenshon, Helge Olaf: Heron of Alexandria and the Dome of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. In: Proceedings of the Third Congress on Construction History. Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus, 20th \u2013 24th May 2009. NEUNPLUS1 , Berlin , S. 1387-1394. {{ISBN|978-3-936033-31-1}}</ref>\n\nAs the great square in Hagia Sophia is 31 m long, it was previously thought, without any reassurance, that this length corresponded to 100 Byzantine feet. Yet such a round figure for the square side would lead to a diagonal with the irrational length of 141,421... because of the factor <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>. This would mean that the square and all dimensions related to it would not be manageable. It has now been realised that in this context, the diagonal is nothing else but the diameter of the circle defined by the vault's circumference, while at the same time, as Heron's circle calculations, in which the practical diameter-values 7 and 14 were used, that the diagonal of the square, or diameter of the circle has been calculated with the tenfold of the exemplary value of 14 or else 140 Byzantine feet. If the dimension of the dome diameter of the Hagia Sophia is constructed with a value that fits to the approximation of <math>\\pi</math> (22/7) all derived values become rational: 70*22/7=220; 105*22/7=330; 140*22/7=440, ... 210*22/7=660.\n\nTherefore, Svenshon suggested that the size of the side of the central square of Hagia Sophia is not 100 Byzantine feet, but instead 99. This measurement is not only rational, but is also embedded in the system of the side-and-diagonal number progression (70/99) and therefore a usable value by the applied mathematics of antiquity. It gives a diagonal of 140 which is manageable for constructing a huge dome as was done in the Hagia Sophia.<ref>[https://lisa.gerda-henkel-stiftung.de/die_hagia_sophia_justinians_mathematischer_raum_als_buehne_des_kaisers?nav_id=3486 Die Hagia Sophia Justinians \u2013 Mathematischer Raum als B\u00fchne des Kaisers (english: Justinian's Hagia Sophia - a methematical space as stage for the emperor]</ref>\n\nThe emperor, together with the [[Patriarch Menas of Constantinople|Patriarch Menas]], inaugurated the new basilica on 27 December 537 \u2013 5 years and 10 months after construction start \u2013 with much pomp.<ref name=\"mw86\">M\u00fcller-Wiener (1977), p. 86.</ref><ref>\"The Chronicle of John Malalas,\" Bk 18.86 Translated by E.

At that time, all religious pictures and statues were removed from the Hagia Sophia. After a brief reprieve under Empress [[Irene (empress)|Irene]] (797\u2013802), the iconoclasts made a comeback.

Emperor [[Basil I]] ordered the church repaired.\n\nAfter the great earthquake of 25 October 989, which collapsed the Western dome arch, Emperor [[Basil II]] asked for the Armenian architect [[Trdat the Architect|Trdat]], creator of the cathedrals of [[Cathedral of Ani|Ani]] and Argina, to direct the repairs.<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink=Christina Maranci|last=Maranci|first=Christina|jstor=3592516|title=The Architect Trdat: Building Practices and Cross-Cultural Exchange in Byzantium and Armenia|journal=[[Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians]]|volume=62|issue=3|pages=294\u2013305|date=September 2003|doi=10.2307/3592516}}</ref> He erected again and reinforced the fallen dome arch, and rebuilt the west side of the dome with 15 dome ribs.<ref name=mw87>M\u00fcller-Wiener (1977), p. 87.</ref> The extent of the damage required six years of repair and reconstruction; the church was re-opened on 13 May 994.

[[Baldwin I of Constantinople]] was crowned emperor on 16 May 1204 in Hagia Sophia, at a ceremony which closely followed Byzantine practices. [[Enrico Dandolo]], the [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] who commanded the sack and invasion of the city by the Latin Crusaders in 1204, is buried inside the church, probably in the upper Eastern gallery. In the 19th century, an Italian restoration team placed a [[cenotaph]] marker near the probable location, which is still visible today. The marker is frequently mistaken by tourists as being a medieval marker of the actual tomb of the doge.

The brothers consolidated the dome and vaults, straightened the columns, and revised the decoration of the exterior and the interior of the building. The mosaics in the upper gallery were exposed and cleaned, although many were recovered \"for protection against further damage\". The old [[chandelier]]s were replaced by new pendant ones. New gigantic circular-framed disks or medallions were hung on columns. These were inscribed with the names of Allah, Muhammad, the first four caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], [[Uthman Ibn Affan|Uthman]] and [[Ali]], and the two grandchildren of Muhammad: [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hassan]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussain]], by the calligrapher [[Kazasker Mustafa \u0130zzed Effendi]] (1801\u20131877). In 1850 the architects Fossati built a new sultan's lodge or loge in a [[Neo-Byzantine architecture|Neo-Byzantine style]] connected to the royal pavilion behind the mosque.

The carpets were removed and marble floor decorations such as the [[Omphalion]] appeared for the first time in centuries, while the white plaster covering many of the mosaics was removed. Nevertheless, the condition of the structure deteriorated, and the [[World Monuments Fund]] placed Hagia Sophia on [[1996 World Monuments Watch]], and again in [[1998 World Monuments Watch|1998]]. The building's copper roof had cracked, causing water to leak down over the fragile frescoes and mosaics. Moisture entered from below as well.  Rising [[ground water]] had raised the level of humidity within the monument, creating an unstable environment for stone and paint. The WMF secured a series of grants from 1997 to 2002 for the restoration of the dome. The first stage of work involved the structural stabilization and repair of the cracked roof, which was undertaken with the participation of the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Turkish Ministry of Culture]].

Its influence, both architecturally and liturgically, was widespread and enduring in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], Roman Catholic, and Muslim worlds alike.\n\nThe vast interior has a complex structure. The [[nave]] is covered by a central dome which at its maximum is {{convert|55.6|m|ftin||abbr=on|sp=us}} from floor level and rests on an arcade of 40 arched windows. Repairs to its structure have left the dome somewhat elliptical, with the diameter varying between {{convert|31.24|and|30.86|m|ftin|abbr=on|sp=us}}.\n\nAt the western entrance side and eastern liturgical side, there are arched openings extended by half domes of identical diameter to the central dome, carried on smaller [[semi-dome]]d [[exedra]]s; a hierarchy of dome-headed elements built up to create a vast oblong interior crowned by the central dome, with a clear span of {{convert|76.2|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}}.<ref name=BAT/>\n\nInterior surfaces are sheathed with polychrome marbles, green and white with purple [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], and gold mosaics.

Structural damage can easily&nbsp;be seen on its exterior surface. To ensure that the Hagia Sophia did not sustain any damage on the interior of the building, studies have been conducted using ground penetrating radar within the gallery of the Hagia Sophia. With the use of GPR (ground penetrating radar), teams discovered weak zones within the Hagia Sophia's gallery and also concluded that the curvature of the vault dome has been shifted out of proportion, compared to its original angular orientation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yal\u00e7\u0131ner|first=Cahit \u00c7a\u011flar|last2=Kurban|first2=Yunus Can|last3=Altunel|first3=Erhan|date=May 2017|title=Research using GPR into the cause of cracks and depressions in the floor of the gallery of Hagia Sophia Museum|journal=Construction and Building Materials|volume=139|pages=458\u201366|doi=10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.02.036|issn=0950-0618}}</ref>[[File: Istanbul.Hagia Sophia055.jpg|thumb|right|West side of the upper gallery]]\nThe upper gallery is laid out in a horseshoe shape that encloses the nave until the apse.

The dome is carried on four spherical triangular [[pendentive]]s, one of the first large-scale uses of them. The pendentives are the corners of the square base of the dome, which curve upwards into the dome to support it, restraining the lateral forces of the dome and allowing its weight to flow downwards.<ref>Kleiner and Mamiya. ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', p. 331.</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/449698/pendentive|title=pendentive (architecture) \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Britannica.com|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> It was the largest pendentive dome in the world until the completion of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], and has a much lower height than any other dome of such a large diameter.\n\nThe great dome at the Hagia Sophia is one hundred and seven feet in diameter and is only two feet thick. The main building material for the Hagia Sophia composed of brick and mortar. Brick aggregate was used to make roofs easier to construct. The aggregate weighs one hundred and fifty pounds per cubic foot, an average weight of masonry construction at the time. Due to the materials plasticity it was chosen over cut stone due to the fact that aggregate can be used over a longer distance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=William|date=1957|title=Design and Technology in Hagia Sophia|journal=Perspecta|volume=4|pages=20\u201327|doi=10.2307/1566853|issn=0079-0958|jstor=1566853}}</ref>\n\nThe weight of the dome remained a problem for most of the building's existence. The original cupola collapsed entirely after the earthquake of 558; in 563 a new dome was built by Isidore the younger, a nephew of Isidore of Miletus. Unlike the original, this included 40 ribs and was raised 20 feet, in order to lower the lateral forces on the church walls. A larger section of the second dome collapsed as well, in two episodes, so that today only two sections of the present dome, in the north and south side, still date from the 562 reconstructions. Of the whole dome's 40 ribs, the surviving north section contains eight ribs, while the south section includes six ribs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mainstone|first=Rowland J.|title=Hagia Sophia|year=2001|publisher=Thames & Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-27945-8|pages=90\u201393}}</ref>\n\nAlthough this design stabilizes the dome and the surrounding walls and arches, the actual construction of the walls of Hagia Sophia weakened the overall structure. The [[bricklayer]]s used more [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] than brick, which is more effective if the mortar was allowed to settle as the building would have been more flexible; however, the builders raced to complete the building and left no time for the mortar to cure before they began the next layer. When the dome was erected, its weight caused the walls to lean outward because of the wet mortar underneath. When Isidore the Younger rebuilt the fallen cupola, he had first to build up the interior of the walls to make them vertical again. Additionally, the architect raised the height of the rebuilt dome by approximately {{convert|6|m|spell=in|abbr=in}} so that the lateral forces would not be as strong and its weight would be transmitted more effectively down into the walls. Moreover, he shaped the new cupola like a [[scallop]]ed shell or the inside of an umbrella, with [[Ogival arch|ribs]] that extend from the top down to the base. These ribs allow the weight of the dome to flow between the windows, down the pendentives, and ultimately to the foundation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Hagia Sophia : architecture, structure, and liturgy of Justinian's great church|last=Mainstone|first=R.J.

This effect was achieved by inserting forty windows around the base of the original structure. Moreover, the insertion of the windows in the dome structure lowers its weight.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Minarets===\nThe [[minarets]] were an Ottoman addition and not part of the original church's Byzantine design. They were built for notification of invitations for prayers ([[Adhan]]: \u0623\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627\u0646) and announcements. Mehmed had built a minaret made from wood over one of the half domes soon after Hagia Sophia's conversion from a cathedral to a mosque. This minaret does not exist today. One of the minarets (at southeast) was built from red brick and can be dated back from the Fatih Sultan Mehmed period or Beyaz\u0131d II period. The other three were built from white limestone and sandstone, of which the slender northeast column was erected by Sultan [[Bayezid II]] during the Selim II period, while the two identical larger minarets to the west were erected by Sultan [[Selim II]] and designed by the famous Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]]. Both are 60 metres in height, and with their thick and massif patterns, complete Hagia Sophia's main structure. Many ornaments and details were added to these minarets on repairs during the 15th, 16th, and 19th centuries, which reflect each period's characteristics and ideals.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hagia Sophia|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=7|title=Mosque|accessdate=26 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128085515/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=7|archive-date=28 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/ext-minarets | title=Minarets &#124; Hagia Sophia Museum}}</ref>\n\n=== Buttresses ===\nNumerous [[buttress]]es have been added throughout the centuries. The flying buttresses to the west of the building, although thought to have been constructed by the Crusaders upon their visit to Constantinople, are actually built during the Byzantine era. This shows that the Byzantines had prior knowledge of flying buttresses which can also be seen at [[Hosios Loukas]] in Central Greece, the [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Rotunda of Galerius]] in [[Thessaloniki]], and [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Other buttresses were constructed during the Ottoman times under the guidance of the architect [[Mimar Sinan|Sinan]]. A total of 24 buttresses were added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/ext-buttresses|title=Buttresses {{!}} Hagia Sophia Museum|website=ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr|publisher=Directorate of Hagia Sophia Museum|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Notable elements and decorations==\nOriginally, under Justinian's reign, the interior decorations consisted of abstract designs on marble slabs on the walls and floors, as well as mosaics on the curving vaults. Of these mosaics, one can still see the two [[archangel]]s [[Gabriel]] and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] in the [[spandrel]]s of the [[bema]]. There were already a few figurative decorations, as attested by the eulogy of [[Paul the Silentiary]]. The spandrels (corners) of the gallery are faced in inlaid thin slabs (''[[opus sectile]]''), showing patterns and figures of flowers and birds in precisely cut pieces of white marble set against a background of black marble. In later stages, figurative mosaics were added, which were destroyed during the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclastic controversy]] (726\u2013843). Present mosaics are from the post-iconoclastic period.\n\nApart from the mosaics, a large number of figurative decorations were added during the second half of the 9th century: an image of Christ in the central dome; Eastern Orthodox saints, prophets and [[Church Fathers]] in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympana]] below; historical figures connected with this church, such as [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople|Patriarch Ignatius]]; some scenes from the [[gospel]] in the galleries.\n[[Basil II]] let artists paint on each of the four pendentives a giant six-winged [[cherub]].<ref name=ma287/> The Ottomans covered their face with a golden [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]],<ref name=ma287/> but in 2009 one of them was restored to the original state.<ref name=ro157>Ronchey (2010), p. 157</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Empress loge Hagia Sophia 2007 002.jpg|The Loge of the Empress.

It was used by the participants in [[synod]]s, who entered and left the meeting chamber through this door. It is said{{By whom|date=December 2017}} that each side is symbolic and that one side represents heaven while the other represents hell. Its panels are covered in fruits and fish motives.

The decorations are of reliefs of geometric shapes as well as plants that are believed to have come from a pagan temple in [[Tarsus, Mersin]] now modern-day Turkey. It was incorporated into the building by [[Emperor Theophilos]] in 838 where it is placed in the south exit in the inner narthex.<ref>\"The Nice Door.\" The nice door, Hagia Sophia Museum| http://ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/door-nice-door</ref>\n\n===The Emperor Door===\nThe Emperor Door is the door that would be used solely by the Emperor as well as his personal bodyguard and retinue. It is the largest door in the Hagia Sophia and has been dated to the 6th century. It is about 7 meters long and Eastern Roman sources say it was made with wood from [[Noah's Ark]].<ref>[\"The Emperor Door.\" The Emperor Door, Hagia Sophia Museum| ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/door-emperor-door]</ref>\n\n=== Wishing column ===\nAt the northwest of the building, there is a column with a hole in the middle covered by bronze plates. This column goes by different names; the perspiring column, the wishing column, the sweating column or the crying column. The column is said to be damp when touched and have supernatural powers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/icmekan.aspx?no=72 |title=Ayasofya M\u00fczesi |publisher=Ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr |accessdate=3 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104033545/http://www.ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/icmekan.aspx?no=72 |archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref> The legend states that since [[Gregory Thaumaturgus|St. Gregory the Miracle Worker]] appeared near the column in the year 1200, it has been moist.

Many of these items were shipped to [[Venice]], whose [[Doge of Venice|Doge]], [[Enrico Dandolo]], had organized the invasion and sack of Constantinople after an agreement with Prince [[Alexios IV Angelos|Alexios Angelos]], the son of a deposed [[Isaac II Angelus|Byzantine emperor]].\n\n==== 19th-century restoration ====\nFollowing the building's conversion into a mosque in 1453, many of its mosaics were covered with plaster, due to Islam's ban on representational imagery. This process was not completed at once, and reports exist from the 17th century in which travelers note that they could still see Christian images in the former church. In 1847\u20131849, the building was restored by two [[Ticino|Swiss-Italian]] [[Fossati brothers]], Gaspare and Giuseppe, and Sultan [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]] allowed them to also document any mosaics they might discover during this process which were later archived in Swiss libraries.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlkkLNd4P44 Hagia Sophia. Nova PBS program; originally aired 2/25/2015]</ref> This work did not include repairing the mosaics and after recording the details about an image, the Fossatis painted it over again. The Fossatis restored the mosaics of the two ''hexapteryga'' (singular {{lang-el|\u1f11\u03be\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd}}, pr. hexapterygon, six-winged angel; it is uncertain whether they are [[seraph]]im or [[cherub]]im) located on the two east pendentives, covering their faces again before the end of the restoration.<ref name=ho207>Hoffman (1999), p. 207</ref> The other two placed on the west pendentives are copies in paint created by the Fossatis since they could find no surviving remains of them.<ref name=ho207/> As in this case, the architects reproduced in paint damaged decorative mosaic patterns, sometimes redesigning them in the process. The Fossati records are the primary sources about a number of mosaic images now believed to have been completely or partially destroyed in the [[1894 Istanbul earthquake]]. These include a mosaic over a now-unidentified ''Door of the Poor'', a large image of a jewel-encrusted cross, and a large number of images of angels, saints, patriarchs, and church fathers. Most of the missing images were located in the building's two tympana.\n\nOne mosaic they documented is [[Christ Pantocrator]] in a circle, which would indicate it to be a ceiling mosaic, possibly even of the main dome which was later covered and painted over with Islamic calligraphy that expounds God as the light of the universe. The drawings of the Hagia Sophia mosaics are today kept in the Cantonal Archive of Ticino.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/047933-000/monuments-eternels|title=Monuments \u00e9ternels|date=21 September 2014|work=Programmes ARTE|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505015235/http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/047933-000/monuments-eternels|archivedate=5 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== 20th-century restoration ====\nA large number of mosaics were uncovered in the 1930s by a team from the [[Byzantine Institute of America]] led by [[Thomas Whittemore]]. The team chose to let a number of simple cross images remain covered by plaster but uncovered all major mosaics found.\n\nBecause of its long history as both a church and a mosque, a particular challenge arises in the restoration process. Christian [[iconography|iconographic]] mosaics can be uncovered, but often at the expense of important and historic Islamic art. Restorers have attempted to maintain a balance between both Christian and Islamic cultures. In particular, much controversy rests upon whether the [[Islamic calligraphy]] on the dome of the cathedral should be removed, in order to permit the underlying Pantocrator mosaic of Christ as Master of the World, to be exhibited (assuming the mosaic still exists).<ref>[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~allin20b/hagiasophia.html The Hagia Sophia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004092727/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~allin20b/hagiasophia.html |date=4 October 2018 }} \u2013 by Mount Holyoke College</ref>\n\nThe Hagia Sophia has been a victim to natural disasters that have caused deterioration to the buildings structure and walls. The deterioration of the Hagia Sophia's walls can be directly relate to salt crystallization. The crystallization of salt is due to an intrusion of rainwater that is at fault for the Hagia Sophia's deteriorating inner and outer walls. Diverting excess rainwater is the main solution to solve the deteriorating walls at the Hagia Sophia.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2015-11-01|title=Influence of the Infiltrated Rainwater on the Degradation of the Inner Wall in Hagia Sophia, Istanbul|journal=Energy Procedia|language=en|volume=78|pages=1353\u201358|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2015.11.153|issn=1876-6102|last1=Mizutani|first1=Etsuko|last2=Ogura|first2=Daisuke|last3=Ishizaki|first3=Takeshi|last4=Abuku|first4=Masaru|last5=Sasaki|first5=Juni|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nBuilt between 532\u2013537 a subsurface structure under the Hagia Sophia has been under investigation, using LaCoste-Romberg gravimeters to determine the depth of the subsurface structure and to discover other hidden cavities beneath the Hagia Sophia.

The emperor with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|nimbus or halo]] could possibly represent emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]] or his son [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] bowing down before Christ Pantocrator, seated on a jeweled throne, giving His blessing and holding in His left hand an open book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guideistanbul.net/ayasofya.htm |title=The Hagia Sophia Church |publisher=Guideistanbul.net |accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> The text on the book reads as follows: \"Peace be with you.

It was inaugurated on 29 March 867 by [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Photius]] and the emperors [[Michael III]] and [[Basil I]]. This mosaic is situated in a high location on the half dome of the apse. Mary is sitting on a throne without a back, holding the Child Jesus on her lap. Her feet rest on a pedestal. Both the pedestal and the throne are adorned with precious stones. The portraits of the archangels Gabriel and Michael (largely destroyed) in the [[bema]] of the arch also date from the 9th century. The mosaics are set against the original golden background of the 6th century. These mosaics were believed to be a reconstruction of the mosaics of the 6th century that were previously destroyed during the iconoclastic era by the Byzantines of that time, as represented in the inaugural sermon by the patriarch Photios. However, no record of figurative decoration of Hagia Sophia exists before this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=12|title=Apse Mosaic |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220041441/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=12|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Emperor Alexander mosaic ====\nThe Emperor Alexander mosaic is not easy to find for the first-time visitor, located on the second floor in a dark corner of the ceiling. It depicts [[Alexander (emperor)|Emperor Alexander]] in full regalia, holding a scroll in his right hand and a [[globus cruciger]] in his left. A drawing by the Fossatis showed that the mosaic survived until 1849 and that [[Thomas Whittemore]], founder of the [[Byzantine Institute of America]] who was granted permission to preserve the mosaics, assumed that it had been destroyed in the earthquake of 1894. Eight years after his death, the mosaic was discovered in 1958 largely through the researches of [[Robert Van Nice]]. Unlike most of the other mosaics in Hagia Sophia, which had been covered over by ordinary plaster, the Alexander mosaic was simply painted over and reflected the surrounding mosaic patterns and thus was well hidden. It was duly cleaned by the Byzantine Institute's successor to Whittemore, [[Paul A. Underwood]].<ref>[[Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|Lord Kinross]]. \"Hagia Sophia: A History of Constantinople.\" ''[[Newsweek]]'', 1972, pp. 132\u201333.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=14|title=Emperor Alexander |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220125559/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=14|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Empress Zoe mosaic ====\n[[File: Empress Zoe mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|The [[Zo\u00eb Porphyrogenita|Empress Zoe]] mosaic]]\nThe Empress Zoe mosaic on the eastern wall of the southern gallery date from the 11th century. Christ Pantocrator, clad in the dark blue robe (as is the custom in Byzantine art), is seated in the middle against a golden background, giving His blessing with the right hand and holding the Bible in His left hand. On either side of His head are the monograms ''IC'' and ''XC'', meaning ''I\u0113sous Christos''. He is flanked by [[Constantine IX Monomachus]] and [[Zoe (empress)|Empress Zoe]], both in ceremonial costumes. He is offering a purse, as a symbol of donation, he made to the church, while she is holding a scroll, symbol of the donations she made. The inscription over the head of the emperor says: \"Constantine, pious emperor in Christ the God, king of the Romans, Monomachus\". The inscription over the head of the empress reads as follows: \"Zo\u00eb, the very pious Augusta\". The previous heads have been scraped off and replaced by the three present ones. Perhaps the earlier mosaic showed her first husband [[Romanos III|Romanus III Argyrus]] or her second husband [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian|Michael IV]]. Another theory is that this mosaic was made for an earlier emperor and empress, with their heads changed into the present ones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=15|title=Empress Zoe |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220112021/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=15|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Comnenus mosaic ====\n[[File: Comnenus mosaics Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|The [[John II Komnenos|Comnenus]] mosaic]]\nThe Comnenus mosaic, also located on the eastern wall of the southern gallery, dates from 1122. The Virgin Mary is standing in the middle, depicted, as usual in Byzantine art, in a dark blue gown. She holds the Child Christ on her lap. He gives His blessing with His right hand while holding a scroll in His left hand. On her right side stands emperor [[John II Comnenus]], represented in a garb embellished with precious stones. He holds a purse, symbol of an imperial donation to the church. Empress [[Piroska of Hungary|Irene]] stands on the left side of the Virgin, wearing ceremonial garments and offering a document. Their eldest son [[Alexios Komnenos (co-emperor)|Alexius Comnenus]] is represented on an adjacent pilaster. He is shown as a beardless youth, probably representing his appearance at his coronation aged seventeen. In this panel, one can already see a difference with the Empress Zoe mosaic that is one century older. There is a more realistic expression in the portraits instead of an idealized representation. The Empress, [[Irene of Hungary|Saint Irene]] (born ''Piroska''), daughter of [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]] is shown with plaited blond hair, rosy cheeks, and grey eyes, revealing her Hungarian descent. The emperor is depicted in a dignified manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=16|title=Comnenus |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220221807/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=16|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== De\u00ebsis mosaic ====\n[[File: Deesis mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|The De\u00ebsis mosaic]]\nThe [[De\u00ebsis]] mosaic ({{lang|grc|\u0394\u03ad\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}, \"Entreaty\") probably dates from 1261. It was commissioned to mark the end of 57 years of Roman Catholic use and the return to the Eastern Orthodox faith. It is the third panel situated in the imperial enclosure of the upper galleries. It is widely considered the finest in Hagia Sophia, because of the softness of the features, the humane expressions and the tones of the mosaic. The style is close to that of the Italian painters of the late 13th or early 14th century, such as [[Duccio]]. In this panel the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[John the Baptist]] (''Ioannes Prodromos''), both shown in three-quarters profile, are imploring the intercession of Christ Pantocrator for humanity on [[Last Judgment|Judgment Day]].

They have been able to survive due to the very high and unreachable location. They depict Saints [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople|Ignatius the Younger]] standing, clothed in white robes with crosses, and holding richly jeweled Holy Bibles. The names of each saint are given around the figures in Greek, in order to enable an identification for the visitor. The other mosaics in the other tympana have not survived probably due to the frequent earthquakes as opposed to any deliberate destruction by the Ottoman conquerors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=11|title=North Tympanum |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220130941/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=11|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Dome Angel Figure Mosaic ====\nThis features four unidentical angel figures. It is believed that these on headed six winged angels, also known as Seraphim, protect the Lord's throne in heaven. There are angels in the east composed in mosaics as where the ones in the west were damaged during the Eastern Roman Period, they have been renewed as fresco. During the Ottoman period the angels' faces were covered with metallic lids in the shape of stars, but were removed to reveal the faces in 2009 during renovations.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/mosa-dome-angel-figures|title=Dome Angel Figures|work=Hagia Sophia Museum}}</ref>\n\n== Other burials ==\n* [[Mustafa I]], in the courtyard\n* [[Enrico Dandolo]], in the east gallery\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile: Upper gallery Hagia Sophia 2007 007.jpg|Mosaics with geometric pattern decorate the upper imperial gallery\nFile:Jesus-Christ-from-Hagia-Sophia.jpg|Detail of De\u00ebsis mosaic\nFile:Johnchrysostom.jpg|Mosaic in the northern tympanum depicting Saint [[John Chrysostom]]\nFile: Fossati 002.JPG|Drawing by the Fossati brothers depicting some mosaics\nFile: Fossati 003.JPG|Another drawing by the Fossati brothers depicting mosaic of six patriarchs in the southern tympanum\nFile: Istanbul.Hagia Sophia041.jpg|One of the mighty stone columns with metal clasps\nFile: Interior of the Hagia Sophia.jpg|''Interior of the Hagia Sophia'' by [[John Singer Sargent]], 1891\nFile: Detail of Sculptural Relief on the Marble Door of the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey.jpg|Detail of [[relief]] on the Marble Door.\nFile: HagiaSophia DomeVerticalPano (pixinn.net).jpg|Interior view of the Hagia Sophia, showing Islamic elements on the top of the main dome ''([[Commons:File:HagiaSophia DomeVerticalPano (pixinn.net).jpg|annotations]]'').\nFile: Adriaan-Reland-Verhandeling-van-de-godsdienst-der-Mahometaanen MG 0720.tif|Haghia Sofia from Adriaan Reland (1676\u20131718): ''Verhandeling van de godsdienst der Mahometaanen'', 1719\nFile: Gaspare Fossati - Louis Haghe - Vue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la grande nef, en regardant l'occident (Hagia Sophia - Ayasofya Mosque nave).jpg|Hagia Sophia during its time as a mosque.

In many cases, Ottoman architects preferred to surround the central dome with four semi-domes rather than two. This is true in the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]], the [[New Mosque (Istanbul)]], and the [[Fatih Mosque]]. Like the original plan of the Hagia Sophia, many of these mosques are also entered through a colonnaded courtyard. However, the [[Church architecture#Atrium|courtyard]] of the Hagia Sophia no longer exists.\n\nMany [[Neo-Byzantine]] churches are modeled on the Hagia Sophia. The [[Kronstadt Naval Cathedral]] and [[Poti Cathedral]] closely replicate the internal geometry of the Hagia Sophia. The interior of the Kronstadt Naval Cathedral is a nearly 1-to-1 copy of the Hagia Sophia. The marble revetment also closely mimics the source work. Like Ottoman mosques, many churches based on the Hagia Sophia include four semi-domes rather than two, such as the [[Church of Saint Sava]] in Belgrade.\n\nSeveral churches combine the layout of the Hagia Sophia with a Latin cross plan. For instance, the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis (St. Louis)]], where the [[transept]] is formed by two semi-domes surrounding the main dome. This church also closely emulates the column capitals and mosaic styles of the Hagia Sophia. Other similar examples include the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia]], [[Saint Clement Catholic Church, Chicago]], and [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]].\n\nThe [[Catedral Metropolitana Ortodoxa]] in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and the [[\u00c9glise du Saint-Esprit (Paris)]] closely follow the interior layout of the Hagia Sophia. Both include four semi-domes, but the two lateral semi-domes are very shallow. In terms of size, the \u00c9glise du Saint-Esprit is about two-thirds the scale of the Hagia Sophia.\n\nSynagogues based on the Hagia Sophia include the [[Congregation Emanu-El (San Francisco)]], [[Great Synagogue of Florence]], and [[Hurva Synagogue]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Architecture|Christianity|Islam|Byzantine Empire|Turkey}}\n* [[Oldest churches in the world]]\n* [[List of megalithic sites]]\n* [[List of Byzantine inventions]]\n* [[Islam in Turkey]]\n* [[Ottoman architecture]]\n* [[List of mosques in Istanbul]]\n* [[List of mosques in Turkey]]\n* [[List of mosques]]\n* [[History of Roman and Byzantine domes]]\n\n'''Related Buildings:'''\n* [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] \u2013 the second most important church of Constantinople\n* [[Hagia Irene]] \u2013 neighbouring church\n* [[Little Hagia Sophia]] \u2013 a 6th-century Byzantine church, now mosque, that might have been built by the same architects as Hagia Sophia\n* [[Church of St. Polyeuctus]] \u2013&nbsp;An earlier church that may have served as a model for the Hagia Sophia\n* [[Chora Church]] \u2013 Byzantine church in Istanbul notable for its well preserved Paleologan mosaics, now a museum too\n* [[Pammakaristos Church]] \u2013 its parekklesion \u2013 also a museum \u2013 is decorated with beautiful mosaics\n* [[Haseki H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131]] \u2013 bath commissioned by [[Roxelana]] for the Hagia Sophia community\n* [[Cafera\u011fa Medresseh]] \u2013 former Koranic school next to Hagia Sophia\n* [[So\u011fuk\u00e7e\u015fme Soka\u011f\u0131]] \u2013 historical street between the Hagia Sophia and Topkap\u0131 Palace\n* [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]\n* [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]]\n* [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Polotsk]]\n* [[Hagia Sophia Church (Sofia)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book\n |last1=Boyran\n |first1=Ebru\n |last2=Fleet\n |first2=Kate\n |title=A social History of Ottoman Istanbul\n |publisher=Cambridge University Press\n |location=Cambridge\n |year=2010\n |isbn=978-0-521-19955-1\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last1=Brubaker\n|first1=Leslie\n|last2=Haldon\n|first2=John\n|title=Byzantium in the Iconoclast era (ca 680\u2013850)\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|location=Cambridge\n|year=2011\n|isbn=978-0-521-43093-7\n}}\n* ''Hagia Sophia''.

This new church was contemporaneously recognized as a major work of architecture. The theories of [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron of Alexandria]] may have been utilized to address the challenges presented by building such an expansive dome over so large a space.<ref>Helge Svenson 2010: Das Bauwerk als \u00bbAistheton Soma\u00ab - Eine Neuinterpretation der Hagia Sophia im Spiegel antiker Vermessungslehre und angewandter Mathematik.

This is appropriate for 22/7 which was used for solving circle problems in construction. When it is ascertained that the circle circumference is U=D*22/7, several elegant solutions are produced, among them those which use a diameter which is cancelling the denominator. As thus Svenhon and Stiffel proposed that the architects used Heron's proposed values for constructing vaults. Central for the erection of the dome of the Hagia Sophia was that the central square corresponds to a diagonal, which is expressible as a rational number approximating <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>. If this was not rightly done, all related measures to the square would not be manageable by the instruments of the surveyors of those times. As thus for the calculation of the square measurements derived from the so-called side-and-diagonal number progression were used. With its help, approximations for <math>\\sqrt{2}</math> can be produced, which is essential for measuring all types of square or square-related objects and surfaces (i.e. 1/1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70). With this method, the squares defined by the numbers 12 and 17, whereas 12 defines the side of the square and 17 its diagonal, has been used as a standard value as early as in cuneiform Babylonian texts.<ref>Svenshon, Helge Olaf: Heron of Alexandria and the Dome of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. In: Proceedings of the Third Congress on Construction History. Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus, 20th \u2013 24th May 2009. NEUNPLUS1 , Berlin , S. 1387-1394. {{ISBN|978-3-936033-31-1}}</ref>\n\nAs the great square in Hagia Sophia is 31 m long, it was previously thought, without any reassurance, that this length corresponded to 100 Byzantine feet. Yet such a round figure for the square side would lead to a diagonal with the irrational length of 141,421... because of the factor <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>. This would mean that the square and all dimensions related to it would not be manageable. It has now been realised that in this context, the diagonal is nothing else but the diameter of the circle defined by the vault's circumference, while at the same time, as Heron's circle calculations, in which the practical diameter-values 7 and 14 were used, that the diagonal of the square, or diameter of the circle has been calculated with the tenfold of the exemplary value of 14 or else 140 Byzantine feet. If the dimension of the dome diameter of the Hagia Sophia is constructed with a value that fits to the approximation of <math>\\pi</math> (22/7) all derived values become rational: 70*22/7=220; 105*22/7=330; 140*22/7=440, ... 210*22/7=660.\n\nTherefore, Svenshon suggested that the size of the side of the central square of Hagia Sophia is not 100 Byzantine feet, but instead 99. This measurement is not only rational, but is also embedded in the system of the side-and-diagonal number progression (70/99) and therefore a usable value by the applied mathematics of antiquity. It gives a diagonal of 140 which is manageable for constructing a huge dome as was done in the Hagia Sophia.<ref>[https://lisa.gerda-henkel-stiftung.de/die_hagia_sophia_justinians_mathematischer_raum_als_buehne_des_kaisers?nav_id=3486 Die Hagia Sophia Justinians \u2013 Mathematischer Raum als B\u00fchne des Kaisers (english: Justinian's Hagia Sophia - a methematical space as stage for the emperor]</ref>\n\nThe emperor, together with the [[Patriarch Menas of Constantinople|Patriarch Menas]], inaugurated the new basilica on 27 December 537 \u2013 5 years and 10 months after construction start \u2013 with much pomp.<ref name=\"mw86\">M\u00fcller-Wiener (1977), p. 86.</ref><ref>\"The Chronicle of John Malalas,\" Bk 18.86 Translated by E.

The brothers consolidated the dome and vaults, straightened the columns, and revised the decoration of the exterior and the interior of the building. The mosaics in the upper gallery were exposed and cleaned, although many were recovered \"for protection against further damage\". The old [[chandelier]]s were replaced by new pendant ones. New gigantic circular-framed disks or medallions were hung on columns. These were inscribed with the names of Allah, Muhammad, the first four caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], [[Uthman Ibn Affan|Uthman]] and [[Ali]], and the two grandchildren of Muhammad: [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hassan]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussain]], by the calligrapher [[Kazasker Mustafa \u0130zzed Effendi]] (1801\u20131877). In 1850 the architects Fossati built a new sultan's lodge or loge in a [[Neo-Byzantine architecture|Neo-Byzantine style]] connected to the royal pavilion behind the mosque. They also renovated the [[minbar]] and [[mihrab]]. Outside the main building, the minarets were repaired and altered so that they were of equal height.<ref>\nTurkish Cultural Foundation.

The carpets were removed and marble floor decorations such as the [[Omphalion]] appeared for the first time in centuries, while the white plaster covering many of the mosaics was removed. Nevertheless, the condition of the structure deteriorated, and the [[World Monuments Fund]] placed Hagia Sophia on [[1996 World Monuments Watch]], and again in [[1998 World Monuments Watch|1998]]. The building's copper roof had cracked, causing water to leak down over the fragile frescoes and mosaics. Moisture entered from below as well.  Rising [[ground water]] had raised the level of humidity within the monument, creating an unstable environment for stone and paint. The WMF secured a series of grants from 1997 to 2002 for the restoration of the dome. The first stage of work involved the structural stabilization and repair of the cracked roof, which was undertaken with the participation of the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Turkish Ministry of Culture]].  The second phase, the preservation of the dome's interior, afforded the opportunity to employ and train young Turkish [[conservator (museum)|conservators]] in the care of mosaics.  By 2006, the WMF project was complete, though many other areas of Hagia Sophia continue to require significant stability improvement, restoration and conservation.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wmf.org/project/hagia-sophia | publisher =World Monuments Fund | title = Hagia Sophia |accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> Hagia Sophia is currently (2014) the second most visited museum in Turkey, attracting almost 3.3 million visitors annually.<ref name= mus />\n\nAlthough use of the complex as a place of worship (mosque or church) was strictly prohibited,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.istanbul.gov.tr/Default.aspx?pid=343 |title= \u00ddstanbul Tan\u00fdt\u00fdm\u00fd \u2013 Ayasofya M\u00fczesi |publisher= Istanbul |accessdate=4 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120124014309/http://www.istanbul.gov.tr/Default.aspx?pid=343 |archivedate= 24 January 2012}}</ref> in 2006 the Turkish government allowed the allocation of a small room in the museum complex to be used as a prayer room for Christian and Muslim museum staff,<ref>[http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2006/07/04/gnd102.html \u0130badete a\u00e7\u0131k Ayasofya] {{in lang|tr}}</ref> and since 2013 from the minarets of the museum the muezzin sings the call to prayer twice per day, in the afternoon.<ref>{{cite web |title= Ayasofya'da ezan okunuyor, duydunuz mu?|url= http://timeturk.com/m/haber.asp?id=585327 |publisher=Timeturk|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Greek American politician Chris Spirou launched an international organization \"Free Agia Sophia Council\" championing the cause of restoring the building to its original function as a Christian church.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://grhomeboy.wordpress.com/2007/06/16/group-unveils-initiative-on-hagia-sophia/|title=Group unveils initiative on Hagia Sophia|work= Homeboy Media News|date= 2007-06-16}}</ref><ref>[http://www.pravoslavie.ru/news/23296.htm \u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0430 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0426\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0438] [[:ru:\u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0435.Ru|\u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0435.Ru]] 26 \u0438\u044e\u043b\u044f 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.pravoslavie.ru/guest/4770.htm \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f \u2013 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0435\u0439)] [[:ru:\u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0435.Ru|\u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0435.Ru]], 29 October 2007.</ref> Since the early 2010s, several campaigns and government high officials, notably Turkey's deputy prime minister [[B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7]] in November 2013, have been demanding that Hagia Sophia be converted into a mosque again.<ref>{{cite news|title= Call to reinstate Hagia Sophia as mosque |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0794494a-4e1b-11e3-8fa5-00144feabdc0.html |accessdate= 24 December 2013|newspaper= Financial Times |date= 15 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Greece angered over Turkish Deputy PM's Hagia Sophia remarks|url= http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/greece-angered-over-turkish-deputy-pms-hagia-sophia-remarks.aspx?PageID=238&NID=58153&NewsCatID=351 |accessdate=20 November 2013|newspaper= [[H\u00fcrriyet]] |date=19 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Turkey: Pressure mounts for Hagia Sophia to be converted into mosque |url= http://www.christiantoday.com/article/turkey.pressure.mounts.for.hagia.sophia.to.be.converted.into.mosque/35055.htm |accessdate= 24 December 2013|newspaper= [[Christian Today]]|date= 13 December 2013}}</ref> In 2015, in retaliation for the acknowledgment by [[Pope Francis]] of the [[Armenian Genocide]], the Mufti of Ankara, Mefail H\u0131zl\u0131, stated that he believes the conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque will be accelerated.<ref>{{cite news|title= Pope's remarks 'to accelerate Hagia Sophia's conversion into mosque'|url= http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/popes-remarks-to-accelerate-hagia-sophias-conversion-into-mosque.aspx?PageID=238&NID=81128&NewsCatID=338 |agency= H\u00fcrriyet |date= 16 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1= Moftah |first1= Lora |title= Hagia Sophia Mosque Conversion?

The temple itself was so richly and artistically decorated that Justinian proclaimed, \"[[Solomon]], I have outdone thee!\" (\u039d\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03ba\u03ac \u03c3\u03b5 \u03a3\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd). Justinian himself had overseen the completion of the greatest cathedral ever built up to that time, and it was to remain the largest cathedral for 1,000 years up until the completion of the [[Seville Cathedral|cathedral in Seville]] in Spain.<ref>{{cite book|title=Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices|first1=J. Gordon|last1=Melton|first2=Martin|last2=Baumann|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=2010|p=513}}</ref>\n\nJustinian's basilica was at once the culminating architectural achievement of [[Late Antiquity|late antiquity]] and the first masterpiece of Byzantine architecture. Its influence, both architecturally and liturgically, was widespread and enduring in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], Roman Catholic, and Muslim worlds alike.\n\nThe vast interior has a complex structure. The [[nave]] is covered by a central dome which at its maximum is {{convert|55.6|m|ftin||abbr=on|sp=us}} from floor level and rests on an arcade of 40 arched windows. Repairs to its structure have left the dome somewhat elliptical, with the diameter varying between {{convert|31.24|and|30.86|m|ftin|abbr=on|sp=us}}.\n\nAt the western entrance side and eastern liturgical side, there are arched openings extended by half domes of identical diameter to the central dome, carried on smaller [[semi-dome]]d [[exedra]]s; a hierarchy of dome-headed elements built up to create a vast oblong interior crowned by the central dome, with a clear span of {{convert|76.2|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}}.<ref name=BAT/>\n\nInterior surfaces are sheathed with polychrome marbles, green and white with purple [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], and gold mosaics. The exterior, clad in [[stucco]], was tinted yellow and red during restorations in the 19th century at the direction of the Fossati architects.\n\n===Narthex and portals===\nThe Imperial Gate was the main entrance between the exo- and esonarthex. It was reserved exclusively for the Emperor. The Byzantine mosaic above the portal depicts Christ and an unnamed emperor. A long ramp from the northern part of the outer Narthex leads up to the upper gallery.\n\n===Upper gallery===\nThroughout history the Hagia Sophia has been a victim to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, and has also fallen victim to vandalism. Structural damage can easily&nbsp;be seen on its exterior surface. To ensure that the Hagia Sophia did not sustain any damage on the interior of the building, studies have been conducted using ground penetrating radar within the gallery of the Hagia Sophia. With the use of GPR (ground penetrating radar), teams discovered weak zones within the Hagia Sophia's gallery and also concluded that the curvature of the vault dome has been shifted out of proportion, compared to its original angular orientation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yal\u00e7\u0131ner|first=Cahit \u00c7a\u011flar|last2=Kurban|first2=Yunus Can|last3=Altunel|first3=Erhan|date=May 2017|title=Research using GPR into the cause of cracks and depressions in the floor of the gallery of Hagia Sophia Museum|journal=Construction and Building Materials|volume=139|pages=458\u201366|doi=10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.02.036|issn=0950-0618}}</ref>[[File: Istanbul.Hagia Sophia055.jpg|thumb|right|West side of the upper gallery]]\nThe upper gallery is laid out in a horseshoe shape that encloses the nave until the apse.

The best-preserved mosaics are located in the southern part of the gallery.\n\nThe upper gallery contains [[Runic inscriptions in Hagia Sophia|runic graffiti]] presumed to be from the [[Varangian Guard]].\n\n===Dome===\n[[File:Istanbul 001.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cupola]] [[dome]], [[semi-dome]], and [[apse]]]]\n[[file:Le 24feb a 11h23 - Ste Sophie (1280x1280).jpg|thumb|View upward to domes ''([[Commons:File:Le 24feb a 11h23 - Ste Sophie (1280x1280).jpg|annotations]]'').]]\nThe [[dome]] of Hagia Sophia has spurred particular interest for many art historians, architects and engineers because of the innovative way the original architects envisioned it. The dome is carried on four spherical triangular [[pendentive]]s, one of the first large-scale uses of them. The pendentives are the corners of the square base of the dome, which curve upwards into the dome to support it, restraining the lateral forces of the dome and allowing its weight to flow downwards.<ref>Kleiner and Mamiya. ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', p. 331.</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/449698/pendentive|title=pendentive (architecture) \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Britannica.com|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> It was the largest pendentive dome in the world until the completion of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], and has a much lower height than any other dome of such a large diameter.\n\nThe great dome at the Hagia Sophia is one hundred and seven feet in diameter and is only two feet thick. The main building material for the Hagia Sophia composed of brick and mortar. Brick aggregate was used to make roofs easier to construct. The aggregate weighs one hundred and fifty pounds per cubic foot, an average weight of masonry construction at the time. Due to the materials plasticity it was chosen over cut stone due to the fact that aggregate can be used over a longer distance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=William|date=1957|title=Design and Technology in Hagia Sophia|journal=Perspecta|volume=4|pages=20\u201327|doi=10.2307/1566853|issn=0079-0958|jstor=1566853}}</ref>\n\nThe weight of the dome remained a problem for most of the building's existence. The original cupola collapsed entirely after the earthquake of 558; in 563 a new dome was built by Isidore the younger, a nephew of Isidore of Miletus. Unlike the original, this included 40 ribs and was raised 20 feet, in order to lower the lateral forces on the church walls. A larger section of the second dome collapsed as well, in two episodes, so that today only two sections of the present dome, in the north and south side, still date from the 562 reconstructions. Of the whole dome's 40 ribs, the surviving north section contains eight ribs, while the south section includes six ribs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mainstone|first=Rowland J.|title=Hagia Sophia|year=2001|publisher=Thames & Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-27945-8|pages=90\u201393}}</ref>\n\nAlthough this design stabilizes the dome and the surrounding walls and arches, the actual construction of the walls of Hagia Sophia weakened the overall structure. The [[bricklayer]]s used more [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] than brick, which is more effective if the mortar was allowed to settle as the building would have been more flexible; however, the builders raced to complete the building and left no time for the mortar to cure before they began the next layer. When the dome was erected, its weight caused the walls to lean outward because of the wet mortar underneath. When Isidore the Younger rebuilt the fallen cupola, he had first to build up the interior of the walls to make them vertical again. Additionally, the architect raised the height of the rebuilt dome by approximately {{convert|6|m|spell=in|abbr=in}} so that the lateral forces would not be as strong and its weight would be transmitted more effectively down into the walls. Moreover, he shaped the new cupola like a [[scallop]]ed shell or the inside of an umbrella, with [[Ogival arch|ribs]] that extend from the top down to the base. These ribs allow the weight of the dome to flow between the windows, down the pendentives, and ultimately to the foundation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Hagia Sophia : architecture, structure, and liturgy of Justinian's great church|last=Mainstone|first=R.J. (Rowland J.)|date=1988|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=978-0500340981|location=New York|oclc=15378795}}</ref>\n\nHagia Sophia is famous for the light that reflects everywhere in the interior of the nave, giving the dome the appearance of hovering above. This effect was achieved by inserting forty windows around the base of the original structure. Moreover, the insertion of the windows in the dome structure lowers its weight.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Minarets===\nThe [[minarets]] were an Ottoman addition and not part of the original church's Byzantine design. They were built for notification of invitations for prayers ([[Adhan]]: \u0623\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627\u0646) and announcements. Mehmed had built a minaret made from wood over one of the half domes soon after Hagia Sophia's conversion from a cathedral to a mosque. This minaret does not exist today. One of the minarets (at southeast) was built from red brick and can be dated back from the Fatih Sultan Mehmed period or Beyaz\u0131d II period. The other three were built from white limestone and sandstone, of which the slender northeast column was erected by Sultan [[Bayezid II]] during the Selim II period, while the two identical larger minarets to the west were erected by Sultan [[Selim II]] and designed by the famous Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]]. Both are 60 metres in height, and with their thick and massif patterns, complete Hagia Sophia's main structure. Many ornaments and details were added to these minarets on repairs during the 15th, 16th, and 19th centuries, which reflect each period's characteristics and ideals.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hagia Sophia|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=7|title=Mosque|accessdate=26 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128085515/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=7|archive-date=28 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/ext-minarets | title=Minarets &#124; Hagia Sophia Museum}}</ref>\n\n=== Buttresses ===\nNumerous [[buttress]]es have been added throughout the centuries. The flying buttresses to the west of the building, although thought to have been constructed by the Crusaders upon their visit to Constantinople, are actually built during the Byzantine era. This shows that the Byzantines had prior knowledge of flying buttresses which can also be seen at [[Hosios Loukas]] in Central Greece, the [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Rotunda of Galerius]] in [[Thessaloniki]], and [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Other buttresses were constructed during the Ottoman times under the guidance of the architect [[Mimar Sinan|Sinan]]. A total of 24 buttresses were added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/ext-buttresses|title=Buttresses {{!}} Hagia Sophia Museum|website=ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr|publisher=Directorate of Hagia Sophia Museum|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Notable elements and decorations==\nOriginally, under Justinian's reign, the interior decorations consisted of abstract designs on marble slabs on the walls and floors, as well as mosaics on the curving vaults. Of these mosaics, one can still see the two [[archangel]]s [[Gabriel]] and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] in the [[spandrel]]s of the [[bema]]. There were already a few figurative decorations, as attested by the eulogy of [[Paul the Silentiary]]. The spandrels (corners) of the gallery are faced in inlaid thin slabs (''[[opus sectile]]''), showing patterns and figures of flowers and birds in precisely cut pieces of white marble set against a background of black marble. In later stages, figurative mosaics were added, which were destroyed during the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclastic controversy]] (726\u2013843). Present mosaics are from the post-iconoclastic period.\n\nApart from the mosaics, a large number of figurative decorations were added during the second half of the 9th century: an image of Christ in the central dome; Eastern Orthodox saints, prophets and [[Church Fathers]] in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympana]] below; historical figures connected with this church, such as [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople|Patriarch Ignatius]]; some scenes from the [[gospel]] in the galleries.\n[[Basil II]] let artists paint on each of the four pendentives a giant six-winged [[cherub]].<ref name=ma287/> The Ottomans covered their face with a golden [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]],<ref name=ma287/> but in 2009 one of them was restored to the original state.<ref name=ro157>Ronchey (2010), p. 157</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Empress loge Hagia Sophia 2007 002.jpg|The Loge of the Empress.

The decorations are of reliefs of geometric shapes as well as plants that are believed to have come from a pagan temple in [[Tarsus, Mersin]] now modern-day Turkey. It was incorporated into the building by [[Emperor Theophilos]] in 838 where it is placed in the south exit in the inner narthex.<ref>\"The Nice Door.\" The nice door, Hagia Sophia Museum| http://ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/door-nice-door</ref>\n\n===The Emperor Door===\nThe Emperor Door is the door that would be used solely by the Emperor as well as his personal bodyguard and retinue.

Many of these items were shipped to [[Venice]], whose [[Doge of Venice|Doge]], [[Enrico Dandolo]], had organized the invasion and sack of Constantinople after an agreement with Prince [[Alexios IV Angelos|Alexios Angelos]], the son of a deposed [[Isaac II Angelus|Byzantine emperor]].\n\n==== 19th-century restoration ====\nFollowing the building's conversion into a mosque in 1453, many of its mosaics were covered with plaster, due to Islam's ban on representational imagery. This process was not completed at once, and reports exist from the 17th century in which travelers note that they could still see Christian images in the former church. In 1847\u20131849, the building was restored by two [[Ticino|Swiss-Italian]] [[Fossati brothers]], Gaspare and Giuseppe, and Sultan [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]] allowed them to also document any mosaics they might discover during this process which were later archived in Swiss libraries.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlkkLNd4P44 Hagia Sophia. Nova PBS program; originally aired 2/25/2015]</ref> This work did not include repairing the mosaics and after recording the details about an image, the Fossatis painted it over again. The Fossatis restored the mosaics of the two ''hexapteryga'' (singular {{lang-el|\u1f11\u03be\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd}}, pr. hexapterygon, six-winged angel; it is uncertain whether they are [[seraph]]im or [[cherub]]im) located on the two east pendentives, covering their faces again before the end of the restoration.<ref name=ho207>Hoffman (1999), p. 207</ref> The other two placed on the west pendentives are copies in paint created by the Fossatis since they could find no surviving remains of them.<ref name=ho207/> As in this case, the architects reproduced in paint damaged decorative mosaic patterns, sometimes redesigning them in the process. The Fossati records are the primary sources about a number of mosaic images now believed to have been completely or partially destroyed in the [[1894 Istanbul earthquake]]. These include a mosaic over a now-unidentified ''Door of the Poor'', a large image of a jewel-encrusted cross, and a large number of images of angels, saints, patriarchs, and church fathers. Most of the missing images were located in the building's two tympana.\n\nOne mosaic they documented is [[Christ Pantocrator]] in a circle, which would indicate it to be a ceiling mosaic, possibly even of the main dome which was later covered and painted over with Islamic calligraphy that expounds God as the light of the universe. The drawings of the Hagia Sophia mosaics are today kept in the Cantonal Archive of Ticino.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/047933-000/monuments-eternels|title=Monuments \u00e9ternels|date=21 September 2014|work=Programmes ARTE|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505015235/http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/047933-000/monuments-eternels|archivedate=5 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== 20th-century restoration ====\nA large number of mosaics were uncovered in the 1930s by a team from the [[Byzantine Institute of America]] led by [[Thomas Whittemore]]. The team chose to let a number of simple cross images remain covered by plaster but uncovered all major mosaics found.\n\nBecause of its long history as both a church and a mosque, a particular challenge arises in the restoration process. Christian [[iconography|iconographic]] mosaics can be uncovered, but often at the expense of important and historic Islamic art. Restorers have attempted to maintain a balance between both Christian and Islamic cultures. In particular, much controversy rests upon whether the [[Islamic calligraphy]] on the dome of the cathedral should be removed, in order to permit the underlying Pantocrator mosaic of Christ as Master of the World, to be exhibited (assuming the mosaic still exists).<ref>[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~allin20b/hagiasophia.html The Hagia Sophia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004092727/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~allin20b/hagiasophia.html |date=4 October 2018 }} \u2013 by Mount Holyoke College</ref>\n\nThe Hagia Sophia has been a victim to natural disasters that have caused deterioration to the buildings structure and walls.

It was inaugurated on 29 March 867 by [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Photius]] and the emperors [[Michael III]] and [[Basil I]]. This mosaic is situated in a high location on the half dome of the apse. Mary is sitting on a throne without a back, holding the Child Jesus on her lap. Her feet rest on a pedestal. Both the pedestal and the throne are adorned with precious stones. The portraits of the archangels Gabriel and Michael (largely destroyed) in the [[bema]] of the arch also date from the 9th century. The mosaics are set against the original golden background of the 6th century. These mosaics were believed to be a reconstruction of the mosaics of the 6th century that were previously destroyed during the iconoclastic era by the Byzantines of that time, as represented in the inaugural sermon by the patriarch Photios. However, no record of figurative decoration of Hagia Sophia exists before this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=12|title=Apse Mosaic |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220041441/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=12|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Emperor Alexander mosaic ====\nThe Emperor Alexander mosaic is not easy to find for the first-time visitor, located on the second floor in a dark corner of the ceiling. It depicts [[Alexander (emperor)|Emperor Alexander]] in full regalia, holding a scroll in his right hand and a [[globus cruciger]] in his left. A drawing by the Fossatis showed that the mosaic survived until 1849 and that [[Thomas Whittemore]], founder of the [[Byzantine Institute of America]] who was granted permission to preserve the mosaics, assumed that it had been destroyed in the earthquake of 1894. Eight years after his death, the mosaic was discovered in 1958 largely through the researches of [[Robert Van Nice]]. Unlike most of the other mosaics in Hagia Sophia, which had been covered over by ordinary plaster, the Alexander mosaic was simply painted over and reflected the surrounding mosaic patterns and thus was well hidden. It was duly cleaned by the Byzantine Institute's successor to Whittemore, [[Paul A. Underwood]].<ref>[[Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|Lord Kinross]]. \"Hagia Sophia: A History of Constantinople.\" ''[[Newsweek]]'', 1972, pp. 132\u201333.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=14|title=Emperor Alexander |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220125559/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=14|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Empress Zoe mosaic ====\n[[File: Empress Zoe mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|The [[Zo\u00eb Porphyrogenita|Empress Zoe]] mosaic]]\nThe Empress Zoe mosaic on the eastern wall of the southern gallery date from the 11th century. Christ Pantocrator, clad in the dark blue robe (as is the custom in Byzantine art), is seated in the middle against a golden background, giving His blessing with the right hand and holding the Bible in His left hand. On either side of His head are the monograms ''IC'' and ''XC'', meaning ''I\u0113sous Christos''. He is flanked by [[Constantine IX Monomachus]] and [[Zoe (empress)|Empress Zoe]], both in ceremonial costumes. He is offering a purse, as a symbol of donation, he made to the church, while she is holding a scroll, symbol of the donations she made. The inscription over the head of the emperor says: \"Constantine, pious emperor in Christ the God, king of the Romans, Monomachus\". The inscription over the head of the empress reads as follows: \"Zo\u00eb, the very pious Augusta\". The previous heads have been scraped off and replaced by the three present ones. Perhaps the earlier mosaic showed her first husband [[Romanos III|Romanus III Argyrus]] or her second husband [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian|Michael IV]]. Another theory is that this mosaic was made for an earlier emperor and empress, with their heads changed into the present ones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=15|title=Empress Zoe |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220112021/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=15|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Comnenus mosaic ====\n[[File: Comnenus mosaics Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|The [[John II Komnenos|Comnenus]] mosaic]]\nThe Comnenus mosaic, also located on the eastern wall of the southern gallery, dates from 1122. The Virgin Mary is standing in the middle, depicted, as usual in Byzantine art, in a dark blue gown. She holds the Child Christ on her lap. He gives His blessing with His right hand while holding a scroll in His left hand. On her right side stands emperor [[John II Comnenus]], represented in a garb embellished with precious stones. He holds a purse, symbol of an imperial donation to the church. Empress [[Piroska of Hungary|Irene]] stands on the left side of the Virgin, wearing ceremonial garments and offering a document. Their eldest son [[Alexios Komnenos (co-emperor)|Alexius Comnenus]] is represented on an adjacent pilaster. He is shown as a beardless youth, probably representing his appearance at his coronation aged seventeen. In this panel, one can already see a difference with the Empress Zoe mosaic that is one century older. There is a more realistic expression in the portraits instead of an idealized representation. The Empress, [[Irene of Hungary|Saint Irene]] (born ''Piroska''), daughter of [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]] is shown with plaited blond hair, rosy cheeks, and grey eyes, revealing her Hungarian descent. The emperor is depicted in a dignified manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=16|title=Comnenus |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220221807/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=16|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== De\u00ebsis mosaic ====\n[[File: Deesis mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|The De\u00ebsis mosaic]]\nThe [[De\u00ebsis]] mosaic ({{lang|grc|\u0394\u03ad\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}, \"Entreaty\") probably dates from 1261. It was commissioned to mark the end of 57 years of Roman Catholic use and the return to the Eastern Orthodox faith. It is the third panel situated in the imperial enclosure of the upper galleries. It is widely considered the finest in Hagia Sophia, because of the softness of the features, the humane expressions and the tones of the mosaic. The style is close to that of the Italian painters of the late 13th or early 14th century, such as [[Duccio]]. In this panel the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[John the Baptist]] (''Ioannes Prodromos''), both shown in three-quarters profile, are imploring the intercession of Christ Pantocrator for humanity on [[Last Judgment|Judgment Day]].

They have been able to survive due to the very high and unreachable location. They depict Saints [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople|Ignatius the Younger]] standing, clothed in white robes with crosses, and holding richly jeweled Holy Bibles. The names of each saint are given around the figures in Greek, in order to enable an identification for the visitor. The other mosaics in the other tympana have not survived probably due to the frequent earthquakes as opposed to any deliberate destruction by the Ottoman conquerors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=11|title=North Tympanum |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220130941/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=11|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Dome Angel Figure Mosaic ====\nThis features four unidentical angel figures. It is believed that these on headed six winged angels, also known as Seraphim, protect the Lord's throne in heaven. There are angels in the east composed in mosaics as where the ones in the west were damaged during the Eastern Roman Period, they have been renewed as fresco. During the Ottoman period the angels' faces were covered with metallic lids in the shape of stars, but were removed to reveal the faces in 2009 during renovations.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/mosa-dome-angel-figures|title=Dome Angel Figures|work=Hagia Sophia Museum}}</ref>\n\n== Other burials ==\n* [[Mustafa I]], in the courtyard\n* [[Enrico Dandolo]], in the east gallery\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile: Upper gallery Hagia Sophia 2007 007.jpg|Mosaics with geometric pattern decorate the upper imperial gallery\nFile:Jesus-Christ-from-Hagia-Sophia.jpg|Detail of De\u00ebsis mosaic\nFile:Johnchrysostom.jpg|Mosaic in the northern tympanum depicting Saint [[John Chrysostom]]\nFile: Fossati 002.JPG|Drawing by the Fossati brothers depicting some mosaics\nFile: Fossati 003.JPG|Another drawing by the Fossati brothers depicting mosaic of six patriarchs in the southern tympanum\nFile: Istanbul.Hagia Sophia041.jpg|One of the mighty stone columns with metal clasps\nFile: Interior of the Hagia Sophia.jpg|''Interior of the Hagia Sophia'' by [[John Singer Sargent]], 1891\nFile: Detail of Sculptural Relief on the Marble Door of the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey.jpg|Detail of [[relief]] on the Marble Door.\nFile: HagiaSophia DomeVerticalPano (pixinn.net).jpg|Interior view of the Hagia Sophia, showing Islamic elements on the top of the main dome ''([[Commons:File:HagiaSophia DomeVerticalPano (pixinn.net).jpg|annotations]]'').\nFile: Adriaan-Reland-Verhandeling-van-de-godsdienst-der-Mahometaanen MG 0720.tif|Haghia Sofia from Adriaan Reland (1676\u20131718): ''Verhandeling van de godsdienst der Mahometaanen'', 1719\nFile: Gaspare Fossati - Louis Haghe - Vue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la grande nef, en regardant l'occident (Hagia Sophia - Ayasofya Mosque nave).jpg|Hagia Sophia during its time as a mosque.

In many cases, Ottoman architects preferred to surround the central dome with four semi-domes rather than two. This is true in the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]], the [[New Mosque (Istanbul)]], and the [[Fatih Mosque]]. Like the original plan of the Hagia Sophia, many of these mosques are also entered through a colonnaded courtyard. However, the [[Church architecture#Atrium|courtyard]] of the Hagia Sophia no longer exists.\n\nMany [[Neo-Byzantine]] churches are modeled on the Hagia Sophia. The [[Kronstadt Naval Cathedral]] and [[Poti Cathedral]] closely replicate the internal geometry of the Hagia Sophia. The interior of the Kronstadt Naval Cathedral is a nearly 1-to-1 copy of the Hagia Sophia. The marble revetment also closely mimics the source work. Like Ottoman mosques, many churches based on the Hagia Sophia include four semi-domes rather than two, such as the [[Church of Saint Sava]] in Belgrade.\n\nSeveral churches combine the layout of the Hagia Sophia with a Latin cross plan. For instance, the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis (St. Louis)]], where the [[transept]] is formed by two semi-domes surrounding the main dome. This church also closely emulates the column capitals and mosaic styles of the Hagia Sophia. Other similar examples include the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia]], [[Saint Clement Catholic Church, Chicago]], and [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]].\n\nThe [[Catedral Metropolitana Ortodoxa]] in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and the [[\u00c9glise du Saint-Esprit (Paris)]] closely follow the interior layout of the Hagia Sophia. Both include four semi-domes, but the two lateral semi-domes are very shallow. In terms of size, the \u00c9glise du Saint-Esprit is about two-thirds the scale of the Hagia Sophia.\n\nSynagogues based on the Hagia Sophia include the [[Congregation Emanu-El (San Francisco)]], [[Great Synagogue of Florence]], and [[Hurva Synagogue]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Architecture|Christianity|Islam|Byzantine Empire|Turkey}}\n* [[Oldest churches in the world]]\n* [[List of megalithic sites]]\n* [[List of Byzantine inventions]]\n* [[Islam in Turkey]]\n* [[Ottoman architecture]]\n* [[List of mosques in Istanbul]]\n* [[List of mosques in Turkey]]\n* [[List of mosques]]\n* [[History of Roman and Byzantine domes]]\n\n'''Related Buildings:'''\n* [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] \u2013 the second most important church of Constantinople\n* [[Hagia Irene]] \u2013 neighbouring church\n* [[Little Hagia Sophia]] \u2013 a 6th-century Byzantine church, now mosque, that might have been built by the same architects as Hagia Sophia\n* [[Church of St. Polyeuctus]] \u2013&nbsp;An earlier church that may have served as a model for the Hagia Sophia\n* [[Chora Church]] \u2013 Byzantine church in Istanbul notable for its well preserved Paleologan mosaics, now a museum too\n* [[Pammakaristos Church]] \u2013 its parekklesion \u2013 also a museum \u2013 is decorated with beautiful mosaics\n* [[Haseki H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131]] \u2013 bath commissioned by [[Roxelana]] for the Hagia Sophia community\n* [[Cafera\u011fa Medresseh]] \u2013 former Koranic school next to Hagia Sophia\n* [[So\u011fuk\u00e7e\u015fme Soka\u011f\u0131]] \u2013 historical street between the Hagia Sophia and Topkap\u0131 Palace\n* [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]\n* [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]]\n* [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Polotsk]]\n* [[Hagia Sophia Church (Sofia)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book\n |last1=Boyran\n |first1=Ebru\n |last2=Fleet\n |first2=Kate\n |title=A social History of Ottoman Istanbul\n |publisher=Cambridge University Press\n |location=Cambridge\n |year=2010\n |isbn=978-0-521-19955-1\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last1=Brubaker\n|first1=Leslie\n|last2=Haldon\n|first2=John\n|title=Byzantium in the Iconoclast era (ca 680\u2013850)\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|location=Cambridge\n|year=2011\n|isbn=978-0-521-43093-7\n}}\n* ''Hagia Sophia''.

The series has also aired in several countries around the world.\n\n==Production==\nThe animated series is based on a series of four environment-themed children's books titled ''Katie and Orbie Save the Planet'', illustrated by Canadian cartoonist [[Ben Wicks]] and written by his daughter Susan Wicks, which were published in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://umanitoba.ca/cm///cmarchive/vol19no4/kidsandnature.html|title=Kid's and Nature|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref> In 1993, [[Lacewood Productions]] adapted the characters into an animated series which was originally in production until 1996, being revived five years later by Amberwood Entertainment and then ending in 2002. Contrary to the original books, the series isn't strictly environment-themed, having stories that range from having a new pet or helping their friends, to address themes like children with divorced parents, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, one of the few series aimed at preschoolers to do so.\n\nThe theme song was written by [[Edmund Eagan]] and performed by his niece, [[Mireille Eagan]].\n\nUnlike most TV series, ''Katie and Orbie'' was animated in a technique referred to by producer Sheldon Wiseman as \"picture-mation,\" similar to an Play-a-sound book, instead of coming to life. Also, none of the characters actually speak, so a variety of [[sound effects]] are used during the stories, with a narrator telling the story. The series was narrated by [[Leslie Nielsen]].\n\n==Main characters==\n* '''Katie''' - A five-year-old blonde girl, who is imaginative, playful, curious and usually quite happy. She almost always wears a green and white striped [[T-shirt]] with blue [[overalls]] and brown [[shoes]]. She lives with her best friend Orbie and her parents in a suburb of an unnamed city. She is very kind and friendly with most people. While she does not attend school yet, she takes dancing classes in some episodes. Her sound effects include a characteristic laugh, as well as occasional sighing, yelling and crying sounds. Those sound effects, as well as her \"voice\" during the ''Did You Know?'' segments, were made by Amanda Tripp.\n* '''Orbie''' - A small and pink [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], who is from an unknown planet from outside Earth's Solar System. ''Katie and Orbie Pick Up the Garbage'', one of the books on which the series is based, explains that he was sent away from his home planet because it was too polluted to sustain life, and the fate of his native family or his species is unknown (this is, however, never mentioned in the actual series). While travelling in a small spaceship, he reached Earth and just happened to land in Katie's backyard, and immediately he and Katie became best friends, resulting in him being \"adopted\" by Katie's parents. He's the same age as Katie, and shares many aspects of her personality. He speaks in a unique series of squeaks and chirps, as well as honk sounds made with his nose, that people appear to be able to understand despite the fact that he isn't speaking any known language. He has red polka dots on his body (early episodes show him as being capable of changing the color of his dots, depending on his mood). People are shown to be oblivious to the fact that he's an alien, and treat him like a normal person, and in any cases where a character is surprised at first glance by Orbie, he warms up to him after getting to know him better. He doesn't wear clothes or appear to require them; however, he does wear clothing and boots if it's raining, cold or snowing. He is a natural acrobat, often breaking into leaps and flips out of sheer joy and has pads on his fingers and toes which enable him to climb walls and hang from the ceiling. He can also use these pads to help him climb other things, but they work best on flat surfaces. He sleeps in Katie's closet, hanging upside down from the bar like a [[bat]]. His sound effects were made by Chris Wightman.\n* '''Wayne''' - Katie's father as well as Orbie's adoptive father. He is always referred to as ''Dad'', but his real name is mentioned in the episode ''The Thunderstorm''. He works at an office building, but his actual job is never mentioned. He is very thoughtful towards Katie, Orbie, and his wife, Susan, and often acts in a funny way to amuse them. He was born and grew up in the city, where his parents still live.\n* '''Susan''' - Katie's mother and Orbie's adoptive mother. She is always referred to as ''Mom'', but her real name is mentioned in the episode ''Mrs. Parette's Picture''. Although she is mostly seen at home, she apparently holds an unknown job too, being shown in some episodes as making or taking business calls, mentioned as doing paperwork, going into the city to attend meetings and even winning an award for her work. Her parents live in the same suburb as the family.\n\nThe family's surname was never mentioned. They also possess a cottage on the shore of a lake (which was bought by Wayne's parents) in which they occasionally spend time, especially in the summer.\n\n==Friends and other characters==\n* '''Mrs. Elaine Parette''' - A friend of the family, she is an old woman who likes children and is usually seen baking cakes or cookies for them. She has a big willow in her garden which serves as a hideout for Katie, Orbie and their friends. She also likes painting. She has at least one daughter, as well as at least two grandchildren. She is always referred simply as ''Mrs. Parette'', being one of the few characters that has a surname. Her name, Elaine, was mentioned by Susan in the story ''Mrs. Parette's Picture'', which was her first appearance.\n* '''Chance''' - The family's [[cat]]. She has orange fur, except for her left ear which has white fur.\n* '''Andy''' - A blond-haired boy (of a paler blond than Katie). His parents are divorced and he lives with his mother and his stepfather named Harry. He is one of the three regular friends of the main characters, the others being Arthur and Yee Ping.\n* '''Arthur''' - A red-haired boy who was initially a bully who got angry easily, and could even hit someone who bothered him (Katie on only one occasion). After that episode, his behavior was changed to that of a simple boy, although a bit mischievous, who plays normally with the other kids. His family is Jewish.\n* '''Carmichael''' - A brown-haired boy who's Katie's best friend that used Katie's coloring pad without asking and didn't invite her to play with him in the bedroom. He appeared in the episode, \"Katie's Depressing Day\". \n* '''Yee Ping''' - A Chinese girl who is very friendly and has even taught Katie and Orbie some Chinese traditions. After Orbie, she was Katie's second friend introduced on the series. At the start of the series, her skin was of a light brown color, but it became white by the end.\n* '''Kyra''' - A girl with the same hair color as Andy, wearing a light blue diadem over it. She has [[asthma]] and, in a later appearance, also wears [[glasses]]. She mostly appears during seasons 2 and 3. Along with Dakota, she is rarely seen during seasons 4\u20136.\n* '''Phoebe and Bryn''' -  Sisters who are always seen together. Phoebe is the youngest and Bryn is the oldest. Phoebe has blonde hair, and Bryn has brown hair. Bryn has an [[egg allergy]].\n* '''Dakota''' -  A Native American boy. Although a common character in seasons 1\u20133, he is practically written out on seasons 4\u20136, only appearing a few times, and is \"replaced\" by the Latino character Miguel.\n* '''Micah''' - A boy who has [[Down syndrome]] (the first character of such condition to appear in an animated series{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}). He lives on a [[farm]] with his mother named Ara, who is also a longtime friend of Susan. He is very good at playing drums and caring for the farm animals.\n* '''Tom''' - A young adult who usually serves as Katie and Orbie's [[babysitter]].\n* '''Polly''' - Tom's girlfriend. Like Tom, she likes children very much and loves to play with them. Orbie once had a crush on her. She only appears on a few stories. Her appearance changed between episodes, first she had red, curly hair and white skin, and later she had straight, black hair with a ponytail, and dark skin.\n* '''Belkis''' - A dark-skinned girl who doesn't speak English and comes from an unspecified faraway country along with her mother.\n* '''Charisse''' - A dark-skinned girl who has [[cerebral palsy]] and uses a [[wheelchair]], she lives with her mother in a 17th floor apartment. Her appearances are scarce.\n* '''Miguel''' - A Latino boy who joins the series by the end of the fourth season although his appearances are scarce. He strongly resembles Dakota, except that Miguel has a lighter skin color.\n* '''Charlie and Megan Cobbington''' - Siblings who are neighbors to Katie and Orbie, along with their parents, and they also have other four siblings. Charlie and the parents are written out of the series after season 2, but Megan still makes brief appearances on season 3 and some cameos on seasons 4\u20136.\n* '''Greg, Jenny and baby Megan''' - A young couple and their baby girl who are neighbors of Katie and Orbie's family. They appear only in a few stories. They also have a dog named Bruce.\n* '''Kerry''' - A dark-skinned girl who had been Katie's best friend for an unspecified time, and in her only appearance (episode ''Close to My Heart'') she and her parents moved to another town because her father had got a new job. Ironically, despite being referred to as Katie's best friend, she never appeared before and is never seen or mentioned after the aforementioned story. Mrs. Parette gave her and Katie two heart-shaped collars with photos of both, so they could remember their friendship whenever they felt alone.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main article|List of Katie and Orbie episodes}}\n\n[[Lacewood Productions]] began work on the series in 1993, creating thirteen half-hour episodes, which debuted in 1994 on Family Channel and quickly became a success, prompting Lacewood to create two further seasons in 1995 and 1996. In the third season, the series switched to [[digital ink and paint]] for coloring.\n\nIn 1997, Lacewood Productions closed down and was taken over by Paragon Entertainment. In 1999, Amberwood Entertainment, a studio founded by Sheldon Wiseman after Lacewood's closure, acquired some of its assets from Paragon, including the series, and alongside [[Entertainment Rights]] began production of 26 more episodes, which debuted on the Family Channel the next year. However, in 2002 after the sixth season the series definitely ended production.\n\nA total of 234 individual stories were produced, three per each half-hour episode. Each episode also had two interstitial segments titled ''Did You Know?'' which tells viewers small pieces of information regarding several subjects, such as plants, food, animals, the body and arts. These segments are narrated off-screen by Katie (voiced by Amanda Tripp).\n\nEach episode is structured by the opening theme, the first story, a ''Did You Know?'' interstitial segment, the second story, another ''Did You Know?'' interstitial segment, the third story and the closing credits.\n\n==DVD releases==\nSeasons 1, 4, 5 and 6 were available on [[DVD]] on the online store of the now-defunct Canadian retailer Express Media; however, seasons 2 and 3 were not.\n\nTwo DVDs were released in Australia in 2010 with season 6 episodes.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0331755|title=Katie and Orbie}}\n* {{tv.com show|katie-and-orbie|Katie and Orbie}}\n\n{{Family Channel original series}}\n{{PBSKids shows}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Katie And Orbie}}\n[[Category:Canadian children's animated fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:1990s Canadian animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian animated television series]]\n[[Category:1994 Canadian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2002 Canadian television series endings]]\n[[Category:Amberwood Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about children]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about extraterrestrial life]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about families]]\n[[Category:Australian Broadcasting Corporation shows]]\n[[Category:Channel 4 television programmes]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel original programming]]\n[[Category:Down syndrome in television]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Family Channel shows]]\n[[Category:PBS Kids shows]]\n[[Category:PBS original programming]]\n[[Category:Canadian television programs based on children's books]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television |\n| show_name = Katie and Orbie\n| image = Katie and Orbie.gif\n| caption = Orbie (left) and Katie (right).

Those sound effects, as well as her \"voice\" during the ''Did You Know?'' segments, were made by Amanda Tripp.\n* '''Orbie''' - A small and pink [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], who is from an unknown planet from outside Earth's Solar System. ''Katie and Orbie Pick Up the Garbage'', one of the books on which the series is based, explains that he was sent away from his home planet because it was too polluted to sustain life, and the fate of his native family or his species is unknown (this is, however, never mentioned in the actual series). While travelling in a small spaceship, he reached Earth and just happened to land in Katie's backyard, and immediately he and Katie became best friends, resulting in him being \"adopted\" by Katie's parents. He's the same age as Katie, and shares many aspects of her personality. He speaks in a unique series of squeaks and chirps, as well as honk sounds made with his nose, that people appear to be able to understand despite the fact that he isn't speaking any known language. He has red polka dots on his body (early episodes show him as being capable of changing the color of his dots, depending on his mood). People are shown to be oblivious to the fact that he's an alien, and treat him like a normal person, and in any cases where a character is surprised at first glance by Orbie, he warms up to him after getting to know him better. He doesn't wear clothes or appear to require them; however, he does wear clothing and boots if it's raining, cold or snowing. He is a natural acrobat, often breaking into leaps and flips out of sheer joy and has pads on his fingers and toes which enable him to climb walls and hang from the ceiling. He can also use these pads to help him climb other things, but they work best on flat surfaces. He sleeps in Katie's closet, hanging upside down from the bar like a [[bat]]. His sound effects were made by Chris Wightman.\n* '''Wayne''' - Katie's father as well as Orbie's adoptive father. He is always referred to as ''Dad'', but his real name is mentioned in the episode ''The Thunderstorm''. He works at an office building, but his actual job is never mentioned. He is very thoughtful towards Katie, Orbie, and his wife, Susan, and often acts in a funny way to amuse them. He was born and grew up in the city, where his parents still live.\n* '''Susan''' - Katie's mother and Orbie's adoptive mother. She is always referred to as ''Mom'', but her real name is mentioned in the episode ''Mrs. Parette's Picture''. Although she is mostly seen at home, she apparently holds an unknown job too, being shown in some episodes as making or taking business calls, mentioned as doing paperwork, going into the city to attend meetings and even winning an award for her work. Her parents live in the same suburb as the family.\n\nThe family's surname was never mentioned. They also possess a cottage on the shore of a lake (which was bought by Wayne's parents) in which they occasionally spend time, especially in the summer.\n\n==Friends and other characters==\n* '''Mrs. Elaine Parette''' - A friend of the family, she is an old woman who likes children and is usually seen baking cakes or cookies for them. She has a big willow in her garden which serves as a hideout for Katie, Orbie and their friends. She also likes painting. She has at least one daughter, as well as at least two grandchildren. She is always referred simply as ''Mrs. Parette'', being one of the few characters that has a surname. Her name, Elaine, was mentioned by Susan in the story ''Mrs. Parette's Picture'', which was her first appearance.\n* '''Chance''' - The family's [[cat]]. She has orange fur, except for her left ear which has white fur.\n* '''Andy''' - A blond-haired boy (of a paler blond than Katie). His parents are divorced and he lives with his mother and his stepfather named Harry. He is one of the three regular friends of the main characters, the others being Arthur and Yee Ping.\n* '''Arthur''' - A red-haired boy who was initially a bully who got angry easily, and could even hit someone who bothered him (Katie on only one occasion). After that episode, his behavior was changed to that of a simple boy, although a bit mischievous, who plays normally with the other kids. His family is Jewish.\n* '''Carmichael''' - A brown-haired boy who's Katie's best friend that used Katie's coloring pad without asking and didn't invite her to play with him in the bedroom. He appeared in the episode, \"Katie's Depressing Day\". \n* '''Yee Ping''' - A Chinese girl who is very friendly and has even taught Katie and Orbie some Chinese traditions. After Orbie, she was Katie's second friend introduced on the series. At the start of the series, her skin was of a light brown color, but it became white by the end.\n* '''Kyra''' - A girl with the same hair color as Andy, wearing a light blue diadem over it. She has [[asthma]] and, in a later appearance, also wears [[glasses]]. She mostly appears during seasons 2 and 3. Along with Dakota, she is rarely seen during seasons 4\u20136.\n* '''Phoebe and Bryn''' -  Sisters who are always seen together. Phoebe is the youngest and Bryn is the oldest. Phoebe has blonde hair, and Bryn has brown hair. Bryn has an [[egg allergy]].\n* '''Dakota''' -  A Native American boy. Although a common character in seasons 1\u20133, he is practically written out on seasons 4\u20136, only appearing a few times, and is \"replaced\" by the Latino character Miguel.\n* '''Micah''' - A boy who has [[Down syndrome]] (the first character of such condition to appear in an animated series{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}). He lives on a [[farm]] with his mother named Ara, who is also a longtime friend of Susan. He is very good at playing drums and caring for the farm animals.\n* '''Tom''' - A young adult who usually serves as Katie and Orbie's [[babysitter]].\n* '''Polly''' - Tom's girlfriend. Like Tom, she likes children very much and loves to play with them. Orbie once had a crush on her. She only appears on a few stories. Her appearance changed between episodes, first she had red, curly hair and white skin, and later she had straight, black hair with a ponytail, and dark skin.\n* '''Belkis''' - A dark-skinned girl who doesn't speak English and comes from an unspecified faraway country along with her mother.\n* '''Charisse''' - A dark-skinned girl who has [[cerebral palsy]] and uses a [[wheelchair]], she lives with her mother in a 17th floor apartment. Her appearances are scarce.\n* '''Miguel''' - A Latino boy who joins the series by the end of the fourth season although his appearances are scarce. He strongly resembles Dakota, except that Miguel has a lighter skin color.\n* '''Charlie and Megan Cobbington''' - Siblings who are neighbors to Katie and Orbie, along with their parents, and they also have other four siblings. Charlie and the parents are written out of the series after season 2, but Megan still makes brief appearances on season 3 and some cameos on seasons 4\u20136.\n* '''Greg, Jenny and baby Megan''' - A young couple and their baby girl who are neighbors of Katie and Orbie's family. They appear only in a few stories. They also have a dog named Bruce.\n* '''Kerry''' - A dark-skinned girl who had been Katie's best friend for an unspecified time, and in her only appearance (episode ''Close to My Heart'') she and her parents moved to another town because her father had got a new job. Ironically, despite being referred to as Katie's best friend, she never appeared before and is never seen or mentioned after the aforementioned story. Mrs. Parette gave her and Katie two heart-shaped collars with photos of both, so they could remember their friendship whenever they felt alone.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main article|List of Katie and Orbie episodes}}\n\n[[Lacewood Productions]] began work on the series in 1993, creating thirteen half-hour episodes, which debuted in 1994 on Family Channel and quickly became a success, prompting Lacewood to create two further seasons in 1995 and 1996. In the third season, the series switched to [[digital ink and paint]] for coloring.\n\nIn 1997, Lacewood Productions closed down and was taken over by Paragon Entertainment. In 1999, Amberwood Entertainment, a studio founded by Sheldon Wiseman after Lacewood's closure, acquired some of its assets from Paragon, including the series, and alongside [[Entertainment Rights]] began production of 26 more episodes, which debuted on the Family Channel the next year. However, in 2002 after the sixth season the series definitely ended production.\n\nA total of 234 individual stories were produced, three per each half-hour episode. Each episode also had two interstitial segments titled ''Did You Know?'' which tells viewers small pieces of information regarding several subjects, such as plants, food, animals, the body and arts. These segments are narrated off-screen by Katie (voiced by Amanda Tripp).\n\nEach episode is structured by the opening theme, the first story, a ''Did You Know?'' interstitial segment, the second story, another ''Did You Know?'' interstitial segment, the third story and the closing credits.\n\n==DVD releases==\nSeasons 1, 4, 5 and 6 were available on [[DVD]] on the online store of the now-defunct Canadian retailer Express Media; however, seasons 2 and 3 were not.\n\nTwo DVDs were released in Australia in 2010 with season 6 episodes.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0331755|title=Katie and Orbie}}\n* {{tv.com show|katie-and-orbie|Katie and Orbie}}\n\n{{Family Channel original series}}\n{{PBSKids shows}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Katie And Orbie}}\n[[Category:Canadian children's animated fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:1990s Canadian animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian animated television series]]\n[[Category:1994 Canadian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2002 Canadian television series endings]]\n[[Category:Amberwood Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about children]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about extraterrestrial life]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about families]]\n[[Category:Australian Broadcasting Corporation shows]]\n[[Category:Channel 4 television programmes]]\n[[Category:Disney Channel original programming]]\n[[Category:Down syndrome in television]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Family Channel shows]]\n[[Category:PBS Kids shows]]\n[[Category:PBS original programming]]\n[[Category:Canadian television programs based on children's books]]\n", "name_user": "Orenburg1", "label": "safe", "comment": "sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_and_Orbie"}

Most gemstones are hard, but some soft minerals are used in jewelry because of their [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] or other physical properties that have [[aesthetic value]]. Rarity is another characteristic that lends value to a gemstone.\n\nApart from jewelry, from earliest antiquity [[engraved gem]]s and [[hardstone carving]]s, such as cups, were major luxury art forms. A gem maker is called a [[lapidary]] or [[gemcutter]]; a [[diamond]] cutter is called a [[diamantaire]].\n\n==Characteristics and classification==\n[[File:Gem.pebbles.800pix.labelled.jpg|thumb|250px|A selection of gemstone pebbles made by tumbling rough rock with abrasive grit, in a rotating drum. The biggest pebble here is {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.]]\n\nThe traditional classification in the West, which goes back to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], begins with a distinction between ''precious'' and ''semi-precious''; similar distinctions are made in other cultures. In modern use the precious stones are [[diamond]], [[ruby]], [[sapphire]] and [[emerald]], with all other gemstones being semi-precious.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 ''Precious Stones''], Max Bauer, p. 2</ref> This distinction reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient times, as well as their quality: all are  [[translucent]] with fine color in their purest forms, except for the colorless diamond, and very hard, with hardnesses of 8 to 10 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Other stones are classified by their color, [[translucency]] and hardness. The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values, for example, while [[garnet]]s are relatively inexpensive, a green garnet called [[tsavorite]] can be far more valuable than a mid-quality emerald.<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, pp. 3\u20138 {{ISBN|0-9728223-8-0}}</ref>  Another unscientific term for semi-precious gemstones used in [[art history]] and [[archaeology]] is [[hardstone]]. Use of the terms 'precious' and 'semi-precious' in a commercial context is, arguably, misleading in that it deceptively implies certain stones are intrinsically more valuable than others, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nIn modern times gemstones are identified by [[gemology|gemologists]], who describe gems and their characteristics using [[technical terminology]] specific to the field of [[gemology]]. The first characteristic a gemologist uses to identify a gemstone is its [[chemical composition]]. For example, [[diamond]]s are made of [[carbon]] (C) and rubies of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{chem|Al|2|O|3}}). Many gems are crystals which are classified by their [[crystal system]] such as [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] or [[trigonal]] or [[monoclinic]]. Another term used is [[crystal habit|habit]], the form the gem is usually found in. For example, diamonds, which have a cubic crystal system, are often found as [[octahedron]]s.\n\nGemstones are classified into different ''groups'', ''species'', and ''varieties''.<ref name=\"Gem Hunt\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Az2_CQAAQBAJ&pg=PT11|title=GEM HUNTER|first=George|last=Frangoulis|date=18 April 2015|publisher=Lulu.com}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} For example, ruby is the red variety of the species [[corundum]], while any other color of corundum is considered sapphire. Other examples are the [[emerald]] (green), [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]] (blue), [[red beryl]] (red), [[goshenite]] (colorless), [[heliodor]] (yellow) and [[morganite]] (pink), which are all varieties of the mineral species [[beryl]].\n\nGems are characterized in terms of [[refractive index]], [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], [[specific gravity]], [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]], [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[fracture]] and luster. They may exhibit [[pleochroism]] or [[double refraction]]. They may have [[luminescence]] and a distinctive [[absorption spectrum]].\n\nMaterial or flaws within a stone may be present as [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]].\n\nGemstones may also be classified in terms of their \"water\". This is a recognized grading of the gem's luster, transparency, or \"brilliance\".<ref>AskOxford.com Concise Oxford English dictionary online.</ref> Very transparent gems are considered \"[[first water]]\", while \"second\" or \"third water\" gems are those of a lesser transparency.<ref>Desirable diamonds: The world's most famous gem. by Sarah Todd.</ref>\n\n==Value==\n[[File:Spanish jewellery-Gold and emerald pendant at VAM-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Spanish emerald and gold pendant at [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]] [[File:Pendant.jpg|thumb|upright|Enamelled gold, amethyst and pearl pendant, about 1880, Pasquale Novissimo (1844\u20131914), V&A Museum number M.36-1928]]\nGemstones have no universally accepted grading system. Diamonds are graded{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} using a system developed by the [[Gemological Institute of America]] (GIA) in the early 1950s. Historically, all gemstones were graded using the naked eye. The GIA system included a major innovation: the introduction of 10x magnification as the standard for grading clarity. Other gemstones are still graded using the naked eye (assuming 20/20 vision).<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p.36 {{ISBN| 0-9728223-8-0}}</ref>\n\nA [[mnemonic device]], the \"four Cs\" (color, cut, clarity, and carats), has been introduced{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} to help the consumer understand the factors used to grade a diamond.<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p. 15</ref> With modification, these categories can be useful in understanding the grading of all gemstones. The four criteria carry different weight depending upon whether they are applied to colored gemstones or to colorless diamonds. In diamonds, cut is the primary determinant of value, followed by clarity and color. The ideal cut diamond will sparkle, to break down light into its constituent rainbow colors (dispersion), chop it up into bright little pieces (scintillation), and deliver it to the eye (brilliance). In its rough crystalline form, a diamond will do none of these things; it requires proper fashioning and this is called \"cut\". In gemstones that have color, including colored diamonds, the purity and beauty of that color is the primary determinant of quality.\n\nPhysical characteristics that make a colored stone valuable are color, clarity to a lesser extent (emeralds will always have a number of inclusions), cut, unusual [[optical phenomena]] within the stone such as color zoning (the uneven distribution of coloring within a gem) and [[star stone| asteria]] (star effects).

Amsterdam. 2012.jpg|thumb|right|A diamond cutter in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]] in 2012]]\n\nA few gemstones are used as gems in the crystal or other form in which they are found. Most however, are cut and polished for usage as jewelry. The picture to the left is of a rural, commercial cutting operation in Thailand. This small factory cuts thousands of carats of sapphire annually. The two main classifications are stones cut as smooth, dome shaped stones called [[cabochon]]s, and stones which are cut with a [[faceting machine]] by polishing small flat windows called [[facet]]s at regular intervals at exact angles.\n\nStones which are opaque or semi-opaque such as [[opal]], [[turquoise]], [[variscite]], etc. are commonly cut as cabochons. These gems are designed to show the stone's color or surface properties as in opal and star sapphires. Grinding wheels and polishing agents are used to grind, shape and polish the smooth dome shape of the stones.<ref>{{cite book|title = Introduction to Lapidary|first = Pansy D.|last = Kraus|publisher = Krause Publications|date = 2007|isbn = 9780801972669|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/introductiontola00krau}}</ref>\n\nGems which are transparent are normally faceted, a method which shows the optical properties of the stone's interior to its best advantage by maximizing reflected light which is perceived by the viewer as sparkle. There are many commonly used shapes for [[diamond cut|faceted stones]]. The facets must be cut at the proper angles, which varies depending on the [[optical]] properties of the gem. If the angles are too steep or too shallow, the light will pass through and not be reflected back toward the viewer. The faceting machine is used to hold the stone onto a flat lap for cutting and polishing the flat facets.<ref>{{cite book|title = Faceting For Amateurs |first1= Glenn|last1= Vargas|first2= Martha|last2= Vargas|date = 2002 |isbn = 9780917646096}}</ref> Rarely, some cutters use special curved laps to cut and polish curved facets.\n\n==Colors==\n[[File:Aurora Pyramid of Hope.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Nearly 300 variations of diamond color exhibited at [[Aurora Pyramid of Hope|the Aurora display]] at the Natural History Museum in London.]]\nThe color of any material is due to the nature of light itself. Daylight, often called white light, is all of the colors of the spectrum combined. When light strikes a material, most of the light is absorbed while a smaller amount of a particular frequency or wavelength is reflected. The part that is reflected reaches the eye as the perceived color. A ruby appears red because it absorbs all the other colors of white light, while reflecting the red.\n\nA material which is mostly the same can exhibit different colors. For example, ruby and sapphire have the same primary chemical composition (both are [[corundum]]) but exhibit different colors because of impurities. Even the same named gemstone can occur in many different colors: sapphires show different shades of blue and pink and \"fancy sapphires\" exhibit a whole range of other colors from yellow to orange-pink, the latter called \"[[Padparadscha|padparadscha sapphire]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenaturalsapphirecompany.com/blog/padparadscha-sapphires-a-buying-guide|title=Padparadscha Sapphires : 10 Tips On Judging The Rare Gem|date=2015-04-06|work=The Natural Sapphire Company Blog|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThis difference in color is based on the atomic structure of the stone. Although the different stones formally have the same chemical composition and structure, they are not exactly the same. Every now and then an atom is replaced by a completely different atom, sometimes as few as one in a million atoms. These so-called [[impurities]] are sufficient to absorb certain colors and leave the other colors unaffected.\n\nFor example, [[beryl]], which is colorless in its pure mineral form, becomes emerald with chromium impurities. If [[manganese]] is added instead of [[chromium]], beryl becomes pink [[morganite]]. With iron, it becomes [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]].\n\nSome gemstone treatments make use of the fact that these impurities can be \"manipulated\", thus changing the color of the gem.<ref name=\"Gem Hunt\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nGemstones are often treated to enhance the color or clarity of the stone. Depending on the type and extent of treatment, they can affect the value of the stone. Some treatments are used widely because the resulting gem is stable, while others are not accepted most commonly because the gem color is unstable and may revert to the original tone.<ref>Gemstone Enhancement: History, Science and State of the Art by Kurt Nassau</ref>\n\n===Heat===\nHeat can improve gemstone color or clarity. The heating process has been well known to gem miners and cutters for centuries, and in many stone types heating is a common practice. Most [[citrine quartz|citrine]] is made by heating [[amethyst]], and partial heating with a strong gradient results in \u201c[[ametrine]]\u201d \u2013 a stone partly amethyst and partly citrine. [[Aquamarine (gemstone)|Aquamarine]] is often heated to remove yellow tones, or to change green colors into the more desirable blue, or enhance its existing blue color to a purer blue.<ref name=Nassau>{{cite book | last = Nassau | first = Kurt | title = Gem Enhancements | publisher = Butterworth Heineman | date = 1994}}</ref>\n\nNearly all [[tanzanite]] is heated at low temperatures to remove brown undertones and give a more desirable blue / purple color.<ref>[http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx Tanzanite Heating - The Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620222334/http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx |date=2016-06-20 }}</ref> A considerable portion of all [[sapphire]] and [[ruby]] is treated with a variety of heat treatments to improve both color and clarity.\n\nWhen jewelry containing diamonds is heated (for repairs) the diamond should be protected with [[boric acid]]; otherwise the diamond (which is pure carbon) could be burned on the surface or even burned completely up. When jewelry containing [[sapphires]] or [[rubies]] is heated, those stones should not be coated with boracic acid (which can etch the surface) or any other substance. They do not have to be protected from burning, like a diamond (although the stones ''do'' need to be protected from heat stress fracture by immersing the part of the jewelry with stones in water when metal parts are heated).\n\n===Radiation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}\nVirtually all [[blue topaz]], both the lighter and the darker blue shades such as \"London\" blue, has been [[Irradiation|irradiated]] to change the color from white to blue. Most greened quartz (Oro Verde) is also irradiated to achieve the yellow-green color. Diamonds are [[Artificially irradiated diamond|irradiated]] to produce fancy-color diamonds (which occur naturally, though rarely in gem quality).\n\n===Waxing/oiling===\nEmeralds containing natural fissures are sometimes filled with wax or oil to disguise them. This wax or oil is also colored to make the emerald appear of better color as well as clarity. Turquoise is also commonly treated in a similar manner.\n\n===Fracture filling===\nFracture filling has been in use with different gemstones such as diamonds, emeralds and sapphires. In 2006 \"glass filled rubies\" received publicity. Rubies over 10 carats (2&nbsp;g) with large fractures were filled with lead glass, thus dramatically improving the appearance (of larger rubies in particular). Such treatments are fairly easy to detect.\n\n==Synthetic and artificial gemstones==\nSynthetic gemstones are distinct from imitation or simulated gems.\n\nSynthetic gems are physically, optically and chemically identical to the natural stone, but are created in controlled conditions in a laboratory.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrESAQAAMAAJ|title=Jewelers' Circular-keystone: JCK.|date=1994|publisher=Chilton Company|language=en}}</ref> Imitation or simulated stones are chemically different from the natural stone but may be optically similar to it; they can be glass, plastic, resins or other compounds.\n\nExamples of simulated or imitation stones include [[cubic zirconia]], composed of [[zirconium]] oxide and simulated [[moissanite]], which are both [[diamond simulants]]. The imitations copy the look and color of the real stone but possess neither their chemical nor physical characteristics. Moissanite actually has a higher refractive index than diamond and when presented beside an equivalently sized and cut diamond will have more \"fire\" than the diamond.\n\nSynthetic, cultured or lab-created gemstones are not imitations. For example, [[diamond]]s, [[Ruby|rubies]], [[sapphire]]s and [[emerald]]s have been manufactured in labs to possess identical chemical and physical characteristics to the naturally occurring variety. Synthetic (lab created) [[corundum]], including ruby and sapphire, is very common and costs much less than the natural stones. Smaller [[synthetic diamond]]s have been manufactured in large quantities as industrial [[abrasive]]s, although larger gem-quality synthetic diamonds are becoming available in multiple carats.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Process Promises Bigger, Better Diamond Crystals|url=http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|accessdate=7 January 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201005848/http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|archivedate=1 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhether a gemstone is a natural stone or lab-created (synthetic), the physical characteristics are the same. Lab-created stones tend to have a more vivid color to them, as impurities are not present in a lab and do not modify the clarity or color of the stone, unless added intentionally for a specific purpose.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==List of rare gemstones==\n* [[Painite]] was discovered in 1956 in Ohngaing in Myanmar.

Most gemstones are hard, but some soft minerals are used in jewelry because of their [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] or other physical properties that have [[aesthetic value]]. Rarity is another characteristic that lends value to a gemstone.\n\nApart from jewelry, from earliest antiquity [[engraved gem]]s and [[hardstone carving]]s, such as cups, were major luxury art forms.

The biggest pebble here is {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.]]\n\nThe traditional classification in the West, which goes back to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], begins with a distinction between ''precious'' and ''semi-precious''; similar distinctions are made in other cultures. In modern use the precious stones are [[diamond]], [[ruby]], [[sapphire]] and [[emerald]], with all other gemstones being semi-precious.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 ''Precious Stones''], Max Bauer, p. 2</ref> This distinction reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient times, as well as their quality: all are  [[translucent]] with fine color in their purest forms, except for the colorless diamond, and very hard, with hardnesses of 8 to 10 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Other stones are classified by their color, [[translucency]] and hardness. The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values, for example, while [[garnet]]s are relatively inexpensive, a green garnet called [[tsavorite]] can be far more valuable than a mid-quality emerald.<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, pp. 3\u20138 {{ISBN|0-9728223-8-0}}</ref>  Another unscientific term for semi-precious gemstones used in [[art history]] and [[archaeology]] is [[hardstone]]. Use of the terms 'precious' and 'semi-precious' in a commercial context is, arguably, misleading in that it deceptively implies certain stones are intrinsically more valuable than others, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nIn modern times gemstones are identified by [[gemology|gemologists]], who describe gems and their characteristics using [[technical terminology]] specific to the field of [[gemology]]. The first characteristic a gemologist uses to identify a gemstone is its [[chemical composition]]. For example, [[diamond]]s are made of [[carbon]] (C) and rubies of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{chem|Al|2|O|3}}). Many gems are crystals which are classified by their [[crystal system]] such as [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] or [[trigonal]] or [[monoclinic]]. Another term used is [[crystal habit|habit]], the form the gem is usually found in. For example, diamonds, which have a cubic crystal system, are often found as [[octahedron]]s.\n\nGemstones are classified into different ''groups'', ''species'', and ''varieties''.<ref name=\"Gem Hunt\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Az2_CQAAQBAJ&pg=PT11|title=GEM HUNTER|first=George|last=Frangoulis|date=18 April 2015|publisher=Lulu.com}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} For example, ruby is the red variety of the species [[corundum]], while any other color of corundum is considered sapphire. Other examples are the [[emerald]] (green), [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]] (blue), [[red beryl]] (red), [[goshenite]] (colorless), [[heliodor]] (yellow) and [[morganite]] (pink), which are all varieties of the mineral species [[beryl]].\n\nGems are characterized in terms of [[refractive index]], [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], [[specific gravity]], [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]], [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[fracture]] and luster. They may exhibit [[pleochroism]] or [[double refraction]]. They may have [[luminescence]] and a distinctive [[absorption spectrum]].\n\nMaterial or flaws within a stone may be present as [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]].\n\nGemstones may also be classified in terms of their \"water\". This is a recognized grading of the gem's luster, transparency, or \"brilliance\".<ref>AskOxford.com Concise Oxford English dictionary online.</ref> Very transparent gems are considered \"[[first water]]\", while \"second\" or \"third water\" gems are those of a lesser transparency.<ref>Desirable diamonds: The world's most famous gem. by Sarah Todd.</ref>\n\n==Value==\n[[File:Spanish jewellery-Gold and emerald pendant at VAM-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Spanish emerald and gold pendant at [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]] [[File:Pendant.jpg|thumb|upright|Enamelled gold, amethyst and pearl pendant, about 1880, Pasquale Novissimo (1844\u20131914), V&A Museum number M.36-1928]]\nGemstones have no universally accepted grading system. Diamonds are graded{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} using a system developed by the [[Gemological Institute of America]] (GIA) in the early 1950s. Historically, all gemstones were graded using the naked eye. The GIA system included a major innovation: the introduction of 10x magnification as the standard for grading clarity. Other gemstones are still graded using the naked eye (assuming 20/20 vision).<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p.36 {{ISBN| 0-9728223-8-0}}</ref>\n\nA [[mnemonic device]], the \"four Cs\" (color, cut, clarity, and carats), has been introduced{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} to help the consumer understand the factors used to grade a diamond.<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p. 15</ref> With modification, these categories can be useful in understanding the grading of all gemstones. The four criteria carry different weight depending upon whether they are applied to colored gemstones or to colorless diamonds. In diamonds, cut is the primary determinant of value, followed by clarity and color. The ideal cut diamond will sparkle, to break down light into its constituent rainbow colors (dispersion), chop it up into bright little pieces (scintillation), and deliver it to the eye (brilliance). In its rough crystalline form, a diamond will do none of these things; it requires proper fashioning and this is called \"cut\". In gemstones that have color, including colored diamonds, the purity and beauty of that color is the primary determinant of quality.\n\nPhysical characteristics that make a colored stone valuable are color, clarity to a lesser extent (emeralds will always have a number of inclusions), cut, unusual [[optical phenomena]] within the stone such as color zoning (the uneven distribution of coloring within a gem) and [[star stone| asteria]] (star effects). Ancient Greeks, for example, greatly valued asteria gemstones, which they regarded as powerful [[love charm]]s, and [[Helen of Troy]] was known to have worn star-[[corundum]].<ref name=burnham>{{cite book | last = Burnham | first = S.M. | title = Precious Stones in Nature, Art and Literature | publisher = Bradlee Whidden | date = 1868}} Page 251 URL: [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/burnham-precious-stones/page_252 Helen of Troy and star corundum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013073718/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/burnham-precious-stones/page_252 |date=2010-10-13 }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2020}}\n\nAside from the [[diamond]], the [[ruby]], [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], [[pearl]] (not, strictly speaking, a gemstone), and [[opal]]<ref name=church>{{cite book | last = Church | first = A.H. | title = Precious Stones considered in their scientific and artistic relations | publisher = His Majesty's Stationery Office, Wyman & Sons | date = 1905|page = 11|chapter = Definition of Precious Stones |url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/church-precious-stones/page_011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092547/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/church-precious-stones/page_011 |archivedate= 2007-09-29 | via = Farlang.com}}</ref> have also been considered{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} to be precious.

Amsterdam. 2012.jpg|thumb|right|A diamond cutter in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]] in 2012]]\n\nA few gemstones are used as gems in the crystal or other form in which they are found. Most however, are cut and polished for usage as jewelry. The picture to the left is of a rural, commercial cutting operation in Thailand. This small factory cuts thousands of carats of sapphire annually. The two main classifications are stones cut as smooth, dome shaped stones called [[cabochon]]s, and stones which are cut with a [[faceting machine]] by polishing small flat windows called [[facet]]s at regular intervals at exact angles.\n\nStones which are opaque or semi-opaque such as [[opal]], [[turquoise]], [[variscite]], etc. are commonly cut as cabochons. These gems are designed to show the stone's color or surface properties as in opal and star sapphires. Grinding wheels and polishing agents are used to grind, shape and polish the smooth dome shape of the stones.<ref>{{cite book|title = Introduction to Lapidary|first = Pansy D.|last = Kraus|publisher = Krause Publications|date = 2007|isbn = 9780801972669|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/introductiontola00krau}}</ref>\n\nGems which are transparent are normally faceted, a method which shows the optical properties of the stone's interior to its best advantage by maximizing reflected light which is perceived by the viewer as sparkle. There are many commonly used shapes for [[diamond cut|faceted stones]]. The facets must be cut at the proper angles, which varies depending on the [[optical]] properties of the gem. If the angles are too steep or too shallow, the light will pass through and not be reflected back toward the viewer. The faceting machine is used to hold the stone onto a flat lap for cutting and polishing the flat facets.<ref>{{cite book|title = Faceting For Amateurs |first1= Glenn|last1= Vargas|first2= Martha|last2= Vargas|date = 2002 |isbn = 9780917646096}}</ref> Rarely, some cutters use special curved laps to cut and polish curved facets.\n\n==Colors==\n[[File:Aurora Pyramid of Hope.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Nearly 300 variations of diamond color exhibited at [[Aurora Pyramid of Hope|the Aurora display]] at the Natural History Museum in London.]]\nThe color of any material is due to the nature of light itself. Daylight, often called white light, is all of the colors of the spectrum combined. When light strikes a material, most of the light is absorbed while a smaller amount of a particular frequency or wavelength is reflected. The part that is reflected reaches the eye as the perceived color. A ruby appears red because it absorbs all the other colors of white light, while reflecting the red.\n\nA material which is mostly the same can exhibit different colors. For example, ruby and sapphire have the same primary chemical composition (both are [[corundum]]) but exhibit different colors because of impurities. Even the same named gemstone can occur in many different colors: sapphires show different shades of blue and pink and \"fancy sapphires\" exhibit a whole range of other colors from yellow to orange-pink, the latter called \"[[Padparadscha|padparadscha sapphire]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenaturalsapphirecompany.com/blog/padparadscha-sapphires-a-buying-guide|title=Padparadscha Sapphires : 10 Tips On Judging The Rare Gem|date=2015-04-06|work=The Natural Sapphire Company Blog|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThis difference in color is based on the atomic structure of the stone. Although the different stones formally have the same chemical composition and structure, they are not exactly the same. Every now and then an atom is replaced by a completely different atom, sometimes as few as one in a million atoms. These so-called [[impurities]] are sufficient to absorb certain colors and leave the other colors unaffected.\n\nFor example, [[beryl]], which is colorless in its pure mineral form, becomes emerald with chromium impurities. If [[manganese]] is added instead of [[chromium]], beryl becomes pink [[morganite]]. With iron, it becomes [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]].\n\nSome gemstone treatments make use of the fact that these impurities can be \"manipulated\", thus changing the color of the gem.<ref name=\"Gem Hunt\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nGemstones are often treated to enhance the color or clarity of the stone. Depending on the type and extent of treatment, they can affect the value of the stone. Some treatments are used widely because the resulting gem is stable, while others are not accepted most commonly because the gem color is unstable and may revert to the original tone.<ref>Gemstone Enhancement: History, Science and State of the Art by Kurt Nassau</ref>\n\n===Heat===\nHeat can improve gemstone color or clarity. The heating process has been well known to gem miners and cutters for centuries, and in many stone types heating is a common practice. Most [[citrine quartz|citrine]] is made by heating [[amethyst]], and partial heating with a strong gradient results in \u201c[[ametrine]]\u201d \u2013 a stone partly amethyst and partly citrine. [[Aquamarine (gemstone)|Aquamarine]] is often heated to remove yellow tones, or to change green colors into the more desirable blue, or enhance its existing blue color to a purer blue.<ref name=Nassau>{{cite book | last = Nassau | first = Kurt | title = Gem Enhancements | publisher = Butterworth Heineman | date = 1994}}</ref>\n\nNearly all [[tanzanite]] is heated at low temperatures to remove brown undertones and give a more desirable blue / purple color.<ref>[http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx Tanzanite Heating - The Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620222334/http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx |date=2016-06-20 }}</ref> A considerable portion of all [[sapphire]] and [[ruby]] is treated with a variety of heat treatments to improve both color and clarity.\n\nWhen jewelry containing diamonds is heated (for repairs) the diamond should be protected with [[boric acid]]; otherwise the diamond (which is pure carbon) could be burned on the surface or even burned completely up. When jewelry containing [[sapphires]] or [[rubies]] is heated, those stones should not be coated with boracic acid (which can etch the surface) or any other substance. They do not have to be protected from burning, like a diamond (although the stones ''do'' need to be protected from heat stress fracture by immersing the part of the jewelry with stones in water when metal parts are heated).\n\n===Radiation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}\nVirtually all [[blue topaz]], both the lighter and the darker blue shades such as \"London\" blue, has been [[Irradiation|irradiated]] to change the color from white to blue. Most greened quartz (Oro Verde) is also irradiated to achieve the yellow-green color. Diamonds are [[Artificially irradiated diamond|irradiated]] to produce fancy-color diamonds (which occur naturally, though rarely in gem quality).\n\n===Waxing/oiling===\nEmeralds containing natural fissures are sometimes filled with wax or oil to disguise them. This wax or oil is also colored to make the emerald appear of better color as well as clarity. Turquoise is also commonly treated in a similar manner.\n\n===Fracture filling===\nFracture filling has been in use with different gemstones such as diamonds, emeralds and sapphires. In 2006 \"glass filled rubies\" received publicity. Rubies over 10 carats (2&nbsp;g) with large fractures were filled with lead glass, thus dramatically improving the appearance (of larger rubies in particular). Such treatments are fairly easy to detect.\n\n==Synthetic and artificial gemstones==\nSynthetic gemstones are distinct from imitation or simulated gems.\n\nSynthetic gems are physically, optically and chemically identical to the natural stone, but are created in controlled conditions in a laboratory.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrESAQAAMAAJ|title=Jewelers' Circular-keystone: JCK.|date=1994|publisher=Chilton Company|language=en}}</ref> Imitation or simulated stones are chemically different from the natural stone but may be optically similar to it; they can be glass, plastic, resins or other compounds.\n\nExamples of simulated or imitation stones include [[cubic zirconia]], composed of [[zirconium]] oxide and simulated [[moissanite]], which are both [[diamond simulants]]. The imitations copy the look and color of the real stone but possess neither their chemical nor physical characteristics. Moissanite actually has a higher refractive index than diamond and when presented beside an equivalently sized and cut diamond will have more \"fire\" than the diamond.\n\nSynthetic, cultured or lab-created gemstones are not imitations. For example, [[diamond]]s, [[Ruby|rubies]], [[sapphire]]s and [[emerald]]s have been manufactured in labs to possess identical chemical and physical characteristics to the naturally occurring variety. Synthetic (lab created) [[corundum]], including ruby and sapphire, is very common and costs much less than the natural stones. Smaller [[synthetic diamond]]s have been manufactured in large quantities as industrial [[abrasive]]s, although larger gem-quality synthetic diamonds are becoming available in multiple carats.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Process Promises Bigger, Better Diamond Crystals|url=http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|accessdate=7 January 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201005848/http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|archivedate=1 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhether a gemstone is a natural stone or lab-created (synthetic), the physical characteristics are the same. Lab-created stones tend to have a more vivid color to them, as impurities are not present in a lab and do not modify the clarity or color of the stone, unless added intentionally for a specific purpose.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==List of rare gemstones==\n* [[Painite]] was discovered in 1956 in Ohngaing in Myanmar.

It has grossed $61.1 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the atmosphere, the horror elements and Spencer's performance, but criticized the teenage characters, slow pacing and story. Both critics and audiences said the film did not take full advantage of its premise.\n\n==Plot==\nTeenager Maggie Thompson moves with her mother Erica to her [[Ohio]] hometown after Erica's husband leaves her. At her new high school, Maggie befriends Haley, Darrell, Chaz, and Andy, who immediately develops a crush on her. They convince Sue Ann \"Ma\" Ellington, a [[veterinary technician]], to [[Shoulder tap (alcohol)|help them buy alcohol]] because they are underage. Sue Ann anonymously reports the teenagers' activities, but they are released because of the officer's history with Andy's father, Ben. The next day, Sue Ann invites the teenagers to drink in her basement. The next time they go, Sue Ann has decorated her basement and lots of other teenagers show up at her house to party, making her popular among the students.\n\nHowever, her hospitality starts to annoy the group as she continuously harasses them to engage in various activities with her. One night, Sue Ann sees Andy and Maggie kissing and becomes jealous (as she is in love with him, having had a crush on his father, Ben, in high school). She drugs Maggie immediately after and takes her earrings. The next morning, Maggie wakes up and notices her earrings are missing and is badly bruised and cut. Scared, Maggie tells Andy that she does not want to go to her house anymore and that she does not want him to go as well and he agrees.\n\nOne day to earn the group's trust back, Ma meets with them to tell them that she has [[pancreatic cancer]] (which is a lie) and that is why she acts the way she does. As she is talking, Haley notices that she is wearing a bracelet that belongs to a friend of theirs. The girls suspect that Sue Ann has been stealing their jewelry so they go to her house to investigate. They are surprised by Genie, Sue Ann's daughter from a failed marriage, who Maggie thought used a wheelchair, but she is clearly able-bodied. She warns them as Sue Ann arrives home, and they narrowly escape.\n\nBen warns Sue Ann to stay away from Andy, calling her pathetic. A flashback reveals that Sue Ann, who had a crush on Ben in high school, performed [[fellatio]] on him in a closet. Once she left the closet, it turned out that she had been doing it to another boy and Ben had tricked her. Ben had gotten the entire school to witness the event (including his current girlfriend Mercedes and a young Erica), and Sue Ann suffered devastating humiliation, which she never recovered from.\n\nBen shows up at Sue Ann's job, to drop off his cat and invites her out for drinks after work. Sue Ann goes home to change and meets him at the bar, where Ben confronts Sue Ann with a tracking device and asks her why his son has been at her house so much. \n\nAn increasingly unstable Sue Ann runs over Mercedes with her truck, killing her. She kills her boss, draws blood from Maggie's dog Louie, and lures Ben to her house, where she knocks him out. Ben wakes up trapped in her bed; Sue Ann pumps Louie's blood into his body, slashes his wrist, and leaves him to die. Maggie tells her mother the truth about Sue Ann and is grounded. Sue Ann sends Maggie a picture of herself with Andy in her basement at Chaz's birthday party. Hurt that he went back to her house despite promising that he would not go back, she sneaks out of the house to confront him. When she arrives, she notices that everyone has left and that only the original group remain. She tries to get Andy to leave but soon realizes that Andy and the rest of her friends have been drugged. Maggie tries to get help and in the process finds Ben's body. As she stands there in horror, Sue Ann renders her unconscious.\n\nMaggie awakens chained in the basement. Sue Ann irons Chaz's stomach, sews Haley's mouth shut, and paints Darrell's face white with industrial paint, because she feels there is only room for one black person in the group, and that is her. Andy awakens, and tries to seduce Sue Ann, as he is well aware that she is in love with him. He tries to trick her by telling her that he loves her and kisses her but she stabs him after knowing that he is lying. An officer arrives and when Maggie screams for help, Sue Ann shoots the officer dead before he can react. She then gathers the four friends around the couch with her and makes Maggie take photos of them together in a crude recreation of what Sue Ann always longed for but never had. Sue Ann then leaves Maggie to be hanged before Genie intervenes. Everyone else wakes up to discover what Sue Ann has done to them but barely have time to react as the house is on fire and need to find a way out. Erica, knowing where Maggie would be, calls her co-worker Stu for help and the two save the teenagers. Sue Ann attempts to throw Genie into the fire, blaming Erica for not stopping Ben from pulling the prank in school. Maggie stabs Sue Ann, saving Genie.\n\nThe group goes outside and asks what has happened. Sue Ann watches them, particularly Andy who survived the stabbing and is lying down next to Maggie. Sue Ann walks upstairs and lies down next to Ben's body, cuddling with it as the house burns.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Sue Ann \"Ma\" Ellington\n** Kyanna Simone Simpson as young Sue Ann\n* [[Diana Silvers]] as Maggie Thompson\n* [[McKaley Miller]] as Haley, Maggie's friend\n* Corey Fogelmanis as Andy Hawkins, Maggie\u2019s boyfriend\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Erica Thompson\n** Teagan Edsell  as young Erica\n* [[Luke Evans]] as Ben Hawkins\n** Andrew Matthew Welch as young Ben\n* Gianni Paolo as Chaz, Maggie's friend\n* Dante Brown as Darrell, Maggie's friend\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as Mercedes, Ben's girlfriend\n** Nicole Carpenter as young Mercedes \n* Tanyell Waivers as Genie Ellington\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Dr. Brooks, Sue Ann's boss\n* [[Dominic Burgess]] as Stu, Erica's co-worker\n* Heather Marie Pate as Ashley\n* [[Tate Taylor]] as Officer Grainger\n* Victor Turpin as Pietro Kramer\n* Margaret Fegan as Stephanie\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Ma'' came together as a result of [[Tate Taylor]]'s desire to direct a film about \"something fucked up,\" and a conversation he had with [[Octavia Spencer]] in which she told him that she was \"sick of only being offered the same role and never getting to be a lead.\"<ref name=indiewire1/> The two are longtime friends, having worked together in films such as ''[[The Help (film)|The Help]]'' and ''[[Get on Up (film)|Get on Up]]''.<ref name=indiewire1/> [[Jason Blum]] and Taylor, who have been friends for a few years, knew each other socially.<ref name=gq/>\n\nTaylor went to Blum's office, reiterating, \"I want to do something really fucked up.\"<ref name=gq/> He read Scotty Landes' script of the film, which [[Blumhouse Productions]] had bought the day before.<ref name=gq/> Although the original draft was written with a white woman in the title role, Taylor immediately thought about Spencer.<ref name=indiewire1/> He went out to the hall, called Spencer, and asked her if she would like to be in a horror film;<ref name=gq/> without reading the script, Spencer boarded the project.<ref name=gq>{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/ma-tate-taylor-interview|title=The Director of Ma Will Not Let You Pee|work=[[GQ]]|first=Max|last=Cea|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere was no backstory for the title character in the original script, which made her \"a complete monster that no audience member could sympathize with.\"<ref name=indiewire1/> The filmmakers made it a priority to come up with an authentic backstory for the role.<ref name=indiewire1>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/05/ma-octavia-spencer-pitch-black-person-killed-first-1202145955/|title=Octavia Spencer Got Pitched 'Ma' and Asked: 'Am I the Black Person Who Gets Killed First?'|work=[[IndieWire]]|first=Zack|last=Sharf|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref> Taylor thought it was important to weave the themes of trauma, the sins of our parents, and how we treat people into the story to create a character audiences can relate to and feel bad for.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/05/ma-octavia-spencer-pitch-black-person-killed-first-1202145955/|title=Octavia Spencer Got Pitched \u2018Ma\u2019 and Asked: \u2018Am I the Black Person Who Gets Killed First?\u2019|last=Sharf|first=Zack|date=2019-05-30|website=IndieWire|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] on the film started in February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/02/octavia-spencer-ma-blumhouse-tate-taylor-movie-juliette-lewis-luke-evans-1202276253/|title=Octavia Spencer To Star In Blumhouse Thriller 'Ma';

Later, in 2018, Taylor and Blumhouse Productions began developing the film, with Taylor directing, Landes writing, Blum producing and Spencer starring it. [[Principal photography]] on the film started in February 2018 and wrapped in March 2018, in [[Mississippi]], with parts shot in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]].\n\n''Ma'' was released in the United States on May 31, 2019, by [[Universal Pictures]]. It has grossed $61.1 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the atmosphere, the horror elements and Spencer's performance, but criticized the teenage characters, slow pacing and story. Both critics and audiences said the film did not take full advantage of its premise.\n\n==Plot==\nTeenager Maggie Thompson moves with her mother Erica to her [[Ohio]] hometown after Erica's husband leaves her. At her new high school, Maggie befriends Haley, Darrell, Chaz, and Andy, who immediately develops a crush on her. They convince Sue Ann \"Ma\" Ellington, a [[veterinary technician]], to [[Shoulder tap (alcohol)|help them buy alcohol]] because they are underage. Sue Ann anonymously reports the teenagers' activities, but they are released because of the officer's history with Andy's father, Ben. The next day, Sue Ann invites the teenagers to drink in her basement. The next time they go, Sue Ann has decorated her basement and lots of other teenagers show up at her house to party, making her popular among the students.\n\nHowever, her hospitality starts to annoy the group as she continuously harasses them to engage in various activities with her. One night, Sue Ann sees Andy and Maggie kissing and becomes jealous (as she is in love with him, having had a crush on his father, Ben, in high school). She drugs Maggie immediately after and takes her earrings. The next morning, Maggie wakes up and notices her earrings are missing and is badly bruised and cut. Scared, Maggie tells Andy that she does not want to go to her house anymore and that she does not want him to go as well and he agrees.\n\nOne day to earn the group's trust back, Ma meets with them to tell them that she has [[pancreatic cancer]] (which is a lie) and that is why she acts the way she does. As she is talking, Haley notices that she is wearing a bracelet that belongs to a friend of theirs. The girls suspect that Sue Ann has been stealing their jewelry so they go to her house to investigate. They are surprised by Genie, Sue Ann's daughter from a failed marriage, who Maggie thought used a wheelchair, but she is clearly able-bodied. She warns them as Sue Ann arrives home, and they narrowly escape.\n\nBen warns Sue Ann to stay away from Andy, calling her pathetic. A flashback reveals that Sue Ann, who had a crush on Ben in high school, performed [[fellatio]] on him in a closet. Once she left the closet, it turned out that she had been doing it to another boy and Ben had tricked her. Ben had gotten the entire school to witness the event (including his current girlfriend Mercedes and a young Erica), and Sue Ann suffered devastating humiliation, which she never recovered from.\n\nBen shows up at Sue Ann's job, to drop off his cat and invites her out for drinks after work. Sue Ann goes home to change and meets him at the bar, where Ben confronts Sue Ann with a tracking device and asks her why his son has been at her house so much. \n\nAn increasingly unstable Sue Ann runs over Mercedes with her truck, killing her. She kills her boss, draws blood from Maggie's dog Louie, and lures Ben to her house, where she knocks him out. Ben wakes up trapped in her bed; Sue Ann pumps Louie's blood into his body, slashes his wrist, and leaves him to die. Maggie tells her mother the truth about Sue Ann and is grounded. Sue Ann sends Maggie a picture of herself with Andy in her basement at Chaz's birthday party. Hurt that he went back to her house despite promising that he would not go back, she sneaks out of the house to confront him. When she arrives, she notices that everyone has left and that only the original group remain. She tries to get Andy to leave but soon realizes that Andy and the rest of her friends have been drugged. Maggie tries to get help and in the process finds Ben's body. As she stands there in horror, Sue Ann renders her unconscious.\n\nMaggie awakens chained in the basement. Sue Ann irons Chaz's stomach, sews Haley's mouth shut, and paints Darrell's face white with industrial paint, because she feels there is only room for one black person in the group, and that is her. Andy awakens, and tries to seduce Sue Ann, as he is well aware that she is in love with him. He tries to trick her by telling her that he loves her and kisses her but she stabs him after knowing that he is lying. An officer arrives and when Maggie screams for help, Sue Ann shoots the officer dead before he can react. She then gathers the four friends around the couch with her and makes Maggie take photos of them together in a crude recreation of what Sue Ann always longed for but never had. Sue Ann then leaves Maggie to be hanged before Genie intervenes. Everyone else wakes up to discover what Sue Ann has done to them but barely have time to react as the house is on fire and need to find a way out. Erica, knowing where Maggie would be, calls her co-worker Stu for help and the two save the teenagers. Sue Ann attempts to throw Genie into the fire, blaming Erica for not stopping Ben from pulling the prank in school.
