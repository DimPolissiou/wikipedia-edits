Since Greek had no equivalent to the Semitic letter {{hebrew|\u05e9}} ''shin'' {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, it was replaced with a {{lang|grc|\u03c3}} ''sigma'' {{IPA|[s]}}, and a masculine singular ending {{IPA|[-s]}} was added in the nominative case, in order to allow the name to be inflected for case (nominative, accusative, etc.) in the grammar of the Greek language. The diphthongal {{IPA|[a]}} vowel of Masoretic ''Yehoshua`'' or ''Yeshua`'' would not have been present in Hebrew/Aramaic pronunciation during this period, and some scholars believe some dialects dropped the [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] sound of the final letter {{hebrew|\u05e2}} ''`ayin'' {{IPA|[\u0295]}}, which in any case had no counterpart in ancient Greek. The Greek writings of [[Philo of Alexandria]]<ref name=\"Philo\">Philo Judaeus, <cite>De ebrietate</cite> in <cite>Philonis Alexandrini opera quae supersunt</cite>ed. P. Wendland, Berlin: Reimer, 1897 (repr. De Gruyter, 1962)vol. 2:170-214, Section 96, Line 2.</ref> and [[Josephus]] frequently mention this name. It also occurs in the Greek New Testament at Acts 7:45 and Hebrews 4:8, referring to Joshua son of Nun.\n\nFrom Greek, {{lang|grc|\u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2}} ''I\u0113sous'' moved into [[Latin]] at least by the time of the [[Vetus Latina]]. The morphological jump this time was not as large as previous changes between language families. {{lang|grc|\u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2}} ''I\u0113sous'' was [[transliterated]] to Latin ''IESVS'', where it stood for many centuries. The Latin name has an irregular declension, with a genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative of {{lang|la|Jesu}}, accusative of {{lang|la|Jesum}}, and nominative of {{lang|la|Jesus}}. [[Lower case|Minuscule]] (lower case) letters were developed around 800 and some time later the [[U]] was invented to distinguish the [[vowel]] sound from the [[consonant]]al sound and the [[J]] to distinguish the consonant from [[I]]. Similarly, Greek minuscules were invented about the same time, prior to that the name was written in [[capital letters]] ({{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9\u039f\u03a5\u03f9}}) or abbreviated as ({{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9}}) with a line over the top, see also [[Christogram]].\n\n[[Modern English]] Jesus derives from Early Middle English ''Iesu'' (attested from the 12th century). The name participated in the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in late [[Middle English]] (15th century). The letter [[J]] was first distinguished from 'I' by the Frenchman [[Petrus Ramus|Pierre Ramus]] in the 16th century, but did not become common in Modern English until the 17th century, so that early 17th century works such as the first edition of the [[King James Version of the Bible]] (1611) continued to print the name with an I.<ref>[http://nazirene.peopleofhonoronly.com/images/kjv1611/Jesus_Iesus.jpg Image] of the first edition of the [[King James Version of the Bible]], [[Gospel of Luke]]. From http://nazirene.peopleofhonoronly.com/. Retrieved March 28, 2006.</ref>\n\nFrom the Latin, the English language takes the forms \"Jesus\" (from the nominative form), and \"Jesu\" (from the vocative and oblique forms). \"Jesus\" is the predominantly used form, while \"Jesu\" lingers in some more archaic texts.\n\n==Biblical references==\n{{see also|Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament}}\n[[File:P.

[[Tyndale]] in the 16th century has the occasional ''Iesu'' in oblique cases and in the vocative; The 1611 [[King James Version]] uses ''Iesus'' throughout, regardless of syntax. ''Jesu'' came to be used in English, especially in [[hymn]]s.\n\n''Jesu'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|i\u02d0|z|u\u02d0}} {{respell|JEE|zoo}}; from [[Latin]] ''Iesu'') is sometimes used as the [[vocative case|vocative]] of [[Jesus]] in English.

These Bible verses refer to ten individuals (in Nehemiah 8:17, the name refers to [[Joshua]] son of [[Nun (biblical figure)|Nun]]).\n\nThis historical change may have been due to a phonological shift whereby guttural phonemes weakened, including {{IPA|[h]}}.<ref>Elisha Qimron, ''The Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls'' (Harvard Semitic Studies: Scholars Press 1986), p.25</ref> Usually, the traditional theophoric element ''Yahu'' {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5}} was shortened at the beginning of a name to {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5}} ''Yo-'', and at the end to {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d4}} ''-yah''. In the contraction of ''Yehoshua`'' to ''Yeshua`'', the vowel is instead fronted (perhaps due to the influence of the ''y'' in the triliteral root ''y-\u0161-\u02bf''). During the post-biblical period the further shortened form ''[[Yeshu]]'' was adopted by Hebrew speaking Jews to refer to the Christian Jesus, however ''Yehoshua'' continued to be used for the other figures called Jesus.<ref>Robert E. Van Voorst Jesus outside the New Testament 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-8028-4368-5}} p124 \"This is likely an inference from the Talmud and other Jewish usage, where Jesus is called Yeshu, and other Jews with the same name are called by the fuller name Yeshua and Yehoshua, \"Joshua\"\"</ref> However, both the Western and Eastern Syriac Christian traditions use the [[Aramaic]] name {{lang|arc|\u071d\u072b\u0718\u0725}}  (in Hebrew script: \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2) ''Yeshu\u02bf and Yisho\u02bf'', respectively, including the ''\u02bfayin''.<ref name=\"Jennings\">[http://dukhrana.com/lexicon/word.php?adr=2:9575&font=Estrangelo+Edessa Jennings]</ref>\n\nIn both Latin and Greek, the name is declined irregularly:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" | Latin\n!

Since Greek had no equivalent to the Semitic letter {{hebrew|\u05e9}} ''shin'' {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, it was replaced with a {{lang|grc|\u03c3}} ''sigma'' {{IPA|[s]}}, and a masculine singular ending {{IPA|[-s]}} was added in the nominative case, in order to allow the name to be inflected for case (nominative, accusative, etc.) in the grammar of the Greek language. The diphthongal {{IPA|[a]}} vowel of Masoretic ''Yehoshua`'' or ''Yeshua`'' would not have been present in Hebrew/Aramaic pronunciation during this period, and some scholars believe some dialects dropped the [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] sound of the final letter {{hebrew|\u05e2}} ''`ayin'' {{IPA|[\u0295]}}, which in any case had no counterpart in ancient Greek. The Greek writings of [[Philo of Alexandria]]<ref name=\"Philo\">Philo Judaeus, <cite>De ebrietate</cite> in <cite>Philonis Alexandrini opera quae supersunt</cite>ed. P. Wendland, Berlin: Reimer, 1897 (repr. De Gruyter, 1962)vol. 2:170-214, Section 96, Line 2.</ref> and [[Josephus]] frequently mention this name. It also occurs in the Greek New Testament at Acts 7:45 and Hebrews 4:8, referring to Joshua son of Nun.\n\nFrom Greek, {{lang|grc|\u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2}} ''I\u0113sous'' moved into [[Latin]] at least by the time of the [[Vetus Latina]]. The morphological jump this time was not as large as previous changes between language families. {{lang|grc|\u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2}} ''I\u0113sous'' was [[transliterated]] to Latin ''IESVS'', where it stood for many centuries. The Latin name has an irregular declension, with a genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative of {{lang|la|Jesu}}, accusative of {{lang|la|Jesum}}, and nominative of {{lang|la|Jesus}}. [[Lower case|Minuscule]] (lower case) letters were developed around 800 and some time later the [[U]] was invented to distinguish the [[vowel]] sound from the [[consonant]]al sound and the [[J]] to distinguish the consonant from [[I]]. Similarly, Greek minuscules were invented about the same time, prior to that the name was written in [[capital letters]] ({{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9\u039f\u03a5\u03f9}}) or abbreviated as ({{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9}}) with a line over the top, see also [[Christogram]].\n\n[[Modern English]] Jesus derives from Early Middle English ''Iesu'' (attested from the 12th century). The name participated in the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in late [[Middle English]] (15th century). The letter [[J]] was first distinguished from 'I' by the Frenchman [[Petrus Ramus|Pierre Ramus]] in the 16th century, but did not become common in Modern English until the 17th century, so that early 17th century works such as the first edition of the [[King James Version of the Bible]] (1611) continued to print the name with an I.<ref>[http://nazirene.peopleofhonoronly.com/images/kjv1611/Jesus_Iesus.jpg Image] of the first edition of the [[King James Version of the Bible]], [[Gospel of Luke]]. From http://nazirene.peopleofhonoronly.com/. Retrieved March 28, 2006.</ref>\n\nFrom the Latin, the English language takes the forms \"Jesus\" (from the nominative form), and \"Jesu\" (from the vocative and oblique forms). \"Jesus\" is the predominantly used form, while \"Jesu\" lingers in some more archaic texts.\n\n==Biblical references==\n{{see also|Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament}}\n[[File:P.

[[Tyndale]] in the 16th century has the occasional ''Iesu'' in oblique cases and in the vocative; The 1611 [[King James Version]] uses ''Iesus'' throughout, regardless of syntax. ''Jesu'' came to be used in English, especially in [[hymn]]s.\n\n''Jesu'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|i\u02d0|z|u\u02d0}} {{respell|JEE|zoo}}; from [[Latin]] ''Iesu'') is sometimes used as the [[vocative case|vocative]] of [[Jesus]] in English.

Its chief geographical features are the [[River Blackwater, County Cavan]], spring wells and dug wells. Ballymagirril is traversed by minor roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 157 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe McGirl family probably owned the townland.

They all lived in Ballymagirril apart from James Elliott who lived in [[Drumlougher]] but had a freehold in Ballymagirril. They were entitled to two votes each. The four election candidates were [[Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont]] and  Lord Newtownbutler (later [[Brinsley Butler, 2nd Earl of Lanesborough]]), both of whom were then elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Cavan County]]. The losing candidates were [[George Montgomery (MP)]] of [[Ballyconnell]] and [[Barry Maxwell, 1st Earl of Farnham]]. Elliott and William Rutledge both voted for Lord Newtownbutler and George Montgomery. John Johnston, Robert Johnston and John Rutledge all voted for Newtownbutler and Coote. Robert Rutledge voted for Coote and Maxwell. Absence from the poll book either meant a resident did not vote or more likely was not a freeholder entitled to vote, which would mean most of the inhabitants of Ballymagirril.\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Ballymagirrill''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\nIn 1804 Lowther Kirkwood of Mullinagrave, parish of Templeport, Co.

The losing candidates were [[George Montgomery (MP)]] of [[Ballyconnell]] and [[Barry Maxwell, 1st Earl of Farnham]]. Elliott and William Rutledge both voted for Lord Newtownbutler and George Montgomery. John Johnston, Robert Johnston and John Rutledge all voted for Newtownbutler and Coote.
