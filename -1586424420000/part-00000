He was married to Frances (n\u00e9e Taylor) from 1944 until her death on September 30, 2012. They have two daughters Susan (1946) and Lee (1950). Walker was assigned in 1946 as a medical officer to the Army of Occupation of Japan ({{army|USA}} [[11th Airborne Division (United States)|11th Airborne Division]] ([[Paratroops]])). After reassignment from the army, he started a pediatric practice in Annapolis in 1953. Stuart became a full-time Professor of Pediatrics at the [[University of Maryland]] School of Medicine in 1961 and was Chief of Pediatrics at [[Mercy Medical Center (Baltimore, Maryland)|Mercy Hospital]] in Baltimore until his retirement in 1984. After Frances' death, Stuart married Patricia (n\u00e9e Empey) in 2013.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\nSailing in the [[International 14]] class, Walker was a member of every American team in international matches between 1961 and 1971 and was, in 1963, the first American to win Bermuda's Princess Elizabeth Trophy and, in 1964, England's Prince of Wales Cup. He was a member of the American Olympic Team, sailing a 5.5 Meter at the 1968 Games and the Pan-American Games, and a Soling in the 1979 Pan-American Games and the 2012 Vintage Yachting Games.\n\nWalker authored ten books on sailboat racing, sail trim, competitive behavior, and low level wind flow, and was a lecturer and contributor to sailing magazines.

In this role he successfully campaigned to keep the Soling in the [[Sailing at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]] and to continue the fleet/match format. He also established a Technical Committee that included the major builders and which has been successful in openly recognizing and solving problems before they become significant.

Singrauli is emerging as India's energy capital. The place earlier known as Shringavali, named after the sage Shringi, was once covered with dense and unnavigable forests and inhabited by wild animals. The place was considered so treacherous that it was used by the kings of Rewa State, who ruled the area till 1947, as an open air prison for detaining errant civilians and officers.\n\nIn the 1800s, there were three separate rulers of Singrauli (previously known as Sidhi), ruling three parts of the territory: First were the Chandela rulers from Bardi (Khatai). Second was Rajasahab Madwas, He was a Baland Rajput, ruled in Majhauli block mostly. Third was Rajasahab of Singrauli.\n\nRaja Kant Deo Singh of Bardi Khatai continues to live in the ancestral Haveli located on the banks of the river Sone. He is an active member of the Bharatiya Janata Party.<ref>[[Chandel (Rajput clan)#Zamindari estates]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2017}}\n\nJust two generations ago, small holders were tending their parcels of land here, and the original inhabitants were gathering honey and herbs in the forest. In the late fifties, a large scale dam banked up the water of the River Rihand. The dam known as Govind Vallabh Pant Sagar was inaugurated by Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru in 1962. Later, rich coal deposits spread over an area of 2200&nbsp;km\u00b2 in the state of M.P. (eastern part of Sidhi District) and U.P. (southern part of Sonebhadra District) were discovered close to the artificial lake that could be used to generate electricity.<ref>http://www.singrauli.nic.in</ref>\n\nOn 24 May 2008, Madhya Pradesh government declared Singrauli as its 50th district by separating from Sidhi with 3 tehsils, Singrauli, Chitrangi and [[Deosar]]. On 1 April 2012 two new tehsils were added, Mada and Sarai.\n\nThis area has group of rock cut caves made in the 7-8th century AD in [[Mada]], 32&nbsp;km from Waidhan. The Mada caves are situated in Mada tehsil of Singrauli district. Famous caves include Vivah Mada, Ganesh Mada and Shankar Mada, Jaljalia and Ravan Mada.\n\nBesides rock cut caves, Singrauli also has painted rock shelters. Ranimachi, Dholagiri and Goura pahad lie in Chitrangi tehsil of Singrauli. These painted rock shelters belong to the Mesolithic age of [[microlith]]ic implements culture. These paintings are representative of the early history of Indian art and are made of red ochre.\n\nPollution threatens the shelters. Connectivity by road is very poor. This ishas been evident for several years but no action has been taken yet to improve road transport and quality of buses.<ref>http://www.mptourism.com/web/unknown/index.html</ref>\n\n==Government==\n*Commissioner of Rewa Division (Commissionaire of Rewa) supervision in District Administration of Singrauli \n*District Collector/District Magistrate office (Collectorate) situated is District Headquarters Town Waidhan\n\nSingrauli Forest :\nConservator of Rewa circle, Supervision in District forest of Singrauli\n*District forest officer(DFO) office is situated in the District Headquarter town of Waidhan\n\n*Additional District Collector / Magistrate (ADM); Joint Collector; Upper Collector, Waidhan\n*Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM), Singrauli(Waidhan), [[Deosar]] and Chitrangi\n*Executive Magistrate / Tehsildar, Singrauli(Waidhan), [[Deosar]], Chitrangi, Mara (Mada) and Sarai\n*Deputy Executive Magistrate / Nayeb Tehsildar office of the other towns and major villages\n\nSingrauli District Police Force:\n*Inspector General of Police (IGP) Rewa Zone, Rewa supervision in District Force of Singrauli\n*Superintendent of Police (SP) office situated is District Headquarter Town Waidhan\n\nOther Police Official:\n*Additional Superintendent of Police (Addled.

Polytechnic College Waidhan.\n\n==Environmental pollution==\nSingrauli region has been identified as a critically polluted area (CPA) by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). Incremental coal mining activities in the region and the rapid development of coal-based thermal power plants has resulted in acute air and water pollution, leading to serious health problems among the residents of the locality, which remain unaddressed.<ref>[http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/singrauli-pollution-matter-serious-concern-admits-high-power-government-panel], Down to earth.</ref> With the coming up of many more power companies the problem is expected to increase. Power plants in the area are poisoning the air and water in the district with mercury, a neurotoxin. Mercury is one of the natural, and perhaps the most harmful, components of coal. During combustion at temperature above 1,100&nbsp;\u00b0C, it vapourises. Given the large quantity of coal burned in thermal plants, a considerable amount of mercury is released into the atmosphere. Some of it cools down and condenses while passing through the plant's boiler and air pollution control system and enters the environment through soil and water. It also enters the environment through run-off from coal mines. In humans, mercury can cause several chronic diseases and death. In 1998, the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), a premier publicly funded scientific agency based in Lucknow, tested over 1,200 people from the Singrauli region for mercury poisoning.

In 2011, Delhi-based non-profit [[Centre for Science and Environment]] had found 0.15 ppm mercury in coal at Anpara village in Sonbhadra.

Singrauli is emerging as India's energy capital. The place earlier known as Shringavali, named after the sage Shringi, was once covered with dense and unnavigable forests and inhabited by wild animals. The place was considered so treacherous that it was used by the kings of Rewa State, who ruled the area till 1947, as an open air prison for detaining errant civilians and officers.\n\nIn the 1800s, there were three separate rulers of Singrauli (previously known as Sidhi), ruling three parts of the territory: First were the Chandela rulers from Bardi (Khatai). Second was Rajasahab Madwas, He was a Baland Rajput, ruled in Majhauli block mostly. Third was Rajasahab of Singrauli.\n\nRaja Kant Deo Singh of Bardi Khatai continues to live in the ancestral Haveli located on the banks of the river Sone. He is an active member of the Bharatiya Janata Party.<ref>[[Chandel (Rajput clan)#Zamindari estates]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2017}}\n\nJust two generations ago, small holders were tending their parcels of land here, and the original inhabitants were gathering honey and herbs in the forest. In the late fifties, a large scale dam banked up the water of the River Rihand. The dam known as Govind Vallabh Pant Sagar was inaugurated by Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru in 1962. Later, rich coal deposits spread over an area of 2200&nbsp;km\u00b2 in the state of M.P. (eastern part of Sidhi District) and U.P. (southern part of Sonebhadra District) were discovered close to the artificial lake that could be used to generate electricity.<ref>http://www.singrauli.nic.in</ref>\n\nOn 24 May 2008, Madhya Pradesh government declared Singrauli as its 50th district by separating from Sidhi with 3 tehsils, Singrauli, Chitrangi and [[Deosar]]. On 1 April 2012 two new tehsils were added, Mada and Sarai.\n\nThis area has group of rock cut caves made in the 7-8th century AD in [[Mada]], 32&nbsp;km from Waidhan. The Mada caves are situated in Mada tehsil of Singrauli district. Famous caves include Vivah Mada, Ganesh Mada and Shankar Mada, Jaljalia and Ravan Mada.\n\nBesides rock cut caves, Singrauli also has painted rock shelters. Ranimachi, Dholagiri and Goura pahad lie in Chitrangi tehsil of Singrauli. These painted rock shelters belong to the Mesolithic age of [[microlith]]ic implements culture. These paintings are representative of the early history of Indian art and are made of red ochre.\n\nPollution threatens the shelters. Connectivity by road is very poor. This ishas been evident for several years but no action has been taken yet to improve road transport and quality of buses.<ref>http://www.mptourism.com/web/unknown/index.html</ref>\n\n==Government==\n*Commissioner of Rewa Division (Commissionaire of Rewa) supervision in District Administration of Singrauli \n*District Collector/District Magistrate office (Collectorate) situated is District Headquarters Town Waidhan\n\nSingrauli Forest :\nConservator of Rewa circle, Supervision in District forest of Singrauli\n*District forest officer(DFO) office is situated in the District Headquarter town of Waidhan\n\n*Additional District Collector / Magistrate (ADM); Joint Collector; Upper Collector, Waidhan\n*Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM), Singrauli(Waidhan), [[Deosar]] and Chitrangi\n*Executive Magistrate / Tehsildar, Singrauli(Waidhan), [[Deosar]], Chitrangi, Mara (Mada) and Sarai\n*Deputy Executive Magistrate / Nayeb Tehsildar office of the other towns and major villages\n\nSingrauli District Police Force:\n*Inspector General of Police (IGP) Rewa Zone, Rewa supervision in District Force of Singrauli\n*Superintendent of Police (SP) office situated is District Headquarter Town Waidhan\n\nOther Police Official:\n*Additional Superintendent of Police (Addled.

Singrauli is well connected to major Indian Cities such as Delhi, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Jabalpur, Bhopal, Lucknow, Varanasi, Patna,Jamshedpur, Jhansi, Ujjain, Prayagraj, Mirzapur, Katni and Bareli. However, Road connectivity to Singrauli remains an issue. Though being on National Highway, commutation to Singrauli by road is difficult. Residents prefer to use trains when travelling to Singrauli. Singrauli Airport is under construction in Katauli village, near District Headquarter [[Waidhan]].\n\n==Industries==\n{{multiple image\n| caption1 = NCL coal mines\n| width1 = 260\n| image1 = Coal mines in singrauli.jpg\n| caption2  = Power plant in Singrauli\n| width2 = 195\n| image2 = Industry in deosar tehsil.jpeg\n}}\nAll major companies operating in Singrauli belongs to Indian energy industry. The operations of companies include mining of coal for power generation. In recent past, several private companies have also joined the league of companies operating in Singrauli. It is expected by 2017 that Singrauli would feed around 35,000 MW of electrical power to the grid alone{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}.\n\nMajor companies operating or coming up at Singrauli are:\n\n1. NTPC Limited (3 Power Plant with combined generation capacity of 9760 MW)\n\n2. Coal India Limited ( Through its subsidiary Northern Coalfields Limited annual production 80 Million MT)\n\n3. Reliance Power Limited (3960 MW)\n\n4. Essar Power Limited (1200 MW)\n\n5. DB Power Limited (1320 MW)\n\nThe rail department is planning to expand their network here. Recently Singrauli station has been allotted an extra platform.\n\n==Education==\nSingrauli has several reputed educational institute.

Degree college Deosar. \nITI course is available in Govt. Polytechnic College Waidhan.\n\n==Environmental pollution==\nSingrauli region has been identified as a critically polluted area (CPA) by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). Incremental coal mining activities in the region and the rapid development of coal-based thermal power plants has resulted in acute air and water pollution, leading to serious health problems among the residents of the locality, which remain unaddressed.<ref>[http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/singrauli-pollution-matter-serious-concern-admits-high-power-government-panel], Down to earth.</ref> With the coming up of many more power companies the problem is expected to increase. Power plants in the area are poisoning the air and water in the district with mercury, a neurotoxin. Mercury is one of the natural, and perhaps the most harmful, components of coal. During combustion at temperature above 1,100&nbsp;\u00b0C, it vapourises. Given the large quantity of coal burned in thermal plants, a considerable amount of mercury is released into the atmosphere. Some of it cools down and condenses while passing through the plant's boiler and air pollution control system and enters the environment through soil and water. It also enters the environment through run-off from coal mines. In humans, mercury can cause several chronic diseases and death. In 1998, the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), a premier publicly funded scientific agency based in Lucknow, tested over 1,200 people from the Singrauli region for mercury poisoning. It found high levels of mercury in humans and in the environment.<ref>[http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/silence-best-policy], Down to earth.</ref> The Central Pollution Control Board analysed 11 coal samples from Singrauli and found mercury concentration in coal ranging between 0.09 parts per million (ppm) and 0.487 ppm. In 2011, Delhi-based non-profit [[Centre for Science and Environment]] had found 0.15 ppm mercury in coal at Anpara village in Sonbhadra. It is estimated that a 1,000 MW thermal power plant is emitting at least 500&nbsp;kg of mercury every year in Singrauli.\nSingrauli is the largest emitter of SO2 gas in India, which is the largest emitter of SO2 gas worldwide according to a Greenpeace report.<ref>https://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/press/3489/india-release_latest-air-pollution-data-ranks-worlds-cities-worst-to-best/</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.singrauli.nic.in}}\n\n{{Rewa Division}}\n\n[[Category:Singrauli| ]]\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Singrauli district]]\n[[Category:Municipal corporations in Madhya Pradesh]]\n[[Category:Cities in Madhya Pradesh]]\n", "name_user": "Brycehughes", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singrauli"}

It lasted from 697 [[AD]] until 1797 AD. Centered on the [[lagoon]] communities of the prosperous city of [[Venice]], the republic grew into a [[Economic history of Venice|trading power]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and strengthened this position in the [[Renaissance]]. Citizens spoke the still-surviving [[Venetian language]], although publishing in (Florentine) Italian became the norm during the Renaissance.\n\nThe Venetian [[city state]] was founded as a safe haven for the people escaping persecution in mainland Europe after the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} In its early years, it prospered on the [[salt trade]]. In subsequent centuries, the city state established a [[thalassocracy]]. It dominated trade on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], including commerce between Europe and North Africa, as well as Asia. The Venetian [[navy]] was used in the [[Crusades]], most notably in the [[Fourth Crusade]]. However, Venice perceived Rome as an enemy and maintained high levels of religious and ideological independence personified by the [[Patriarch of Venice]] and a highly-developed independent publishing industry that served as a haven from Roman Catholic censorship for many centuries. Venice achieved territorial conquests along the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Venice became home to an extremely wealthy merchant class, who patronized renowned art and architecture along the city's lagoons. Venetian merchants were influential financiers in Europe. The city was also the birthplace of great European explorers, such as [[Marco Polo]], as well as [[Baroque]] composers such as [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and [[Benedetto Marcello]].\n\nThe republic was ruled by the [[Doge of Venice|Doge]], who was elected by members of the [[Great Council of Venice]], the city-state's [[parliament]]. The ruling class was an [[oligarchy]] of merchants and aristocrats. Venice and other Italian maritime republics played a key role in fostering capitalism. Venetian citizens generally supported the system of governance. The city-state enforced strict laws and employed ruthless tactics in its prisons.\n\nThe opening of new trade routes to the Americas and the East Indies via the Atlantic Ocean marked the beginning of Venice's decline as a powerful maritime republic. The city state suffered defeats from the navy of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1797, the republic was plundered by retreating Austrian and then French forces, following an invasion by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and the Republic of Venice was split into the Austrian [[Venetian Province]], the [[Cisalpine Republic]], a French client state, and the Ionian [[French departments of Greece]]. Venice became part of a [[Italian unification|unified Italy]] in the 19th century.\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n{{anchor|Etymology}}\n\n==Name==\nIt was formally known as the Most Serene Republic of Venice ({{lang-it|Serenissima Repubblica di Venezia}}, {{lang-vec|Seren\u00ecsima Rep\u00f9blica V\u00e8neta}}, or {{lang-vec|Rep\u00f9blica de Venesia}}) and is often referred to as ''La Serenissima'', in reference to its title as one of the \"[[Most Serene Republic]]s\".\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Republic of Venice|Timeline of the Republic of Venice}}\nDuring the 5th century, [[Triveneto|northeast Italy]] was devastated by the Germanic barbarian invasions. A large number of the inhabitants moved to the coastal [[lagoon]]s, looking for a safer place to live. Here they established a collection of lagoon communities, stretching over about {{cvt|130|km}} from [[Chioggia]] in the south to [[Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Grado]] in the north, who banded together for mutual defence from the [[Lombards]], [[Huns]], and other invading peoples as the power of the [[Western Roman Empire]] dwindled in northern Italy.\n\nThese communities were subjected to the authority of the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n[[File:The Venetia c 600 AD.jpg|thumb|The Venetia c 600 AD]]\n\nAt some point in the first decades of the eighth century, the people of the [[Byzantine]] province of Venice elected their first leader [[Orso Ipato|Ursus]] (or Orso Ipato), who was confirmed by [[Constantinople]] and given the titles of ''[[hypatus]]'' and ''[[dux]]''. He was the first historical [[Doge of Venice]]. Tradition, however, first attested in the early 11th century, states that the Venetians first proclaimed one [[Paolo Lucio Anafesto|Anafestus Paulicius]] duke in 697, though this story dates to no earlier than the chronicle of [[John, deacon of Venice|John the Deacon]]. Whichever the case, the first doges had their power base in [[Eraclea|Heraclea]].\n\n===Rise===\n\nUrsus's successor, [[Teodato Ipato|Deusdedit]], moved his seat from Heraclea to [[Malamocco]] in the 740s. He was the son of Ursus and represented the attempt of his father to establish a dynasty. Such attempts were more than commonplace among the doges of the first few centuries of Venetian history, but all were ultimately unsuccessful. During the reign of Deusdedit, Venice became the only remaining Byzantine possession in the north and the changing politics of the [[Frankish Empire]] began to change the factional divisions within Venetia.\n\nOne faction was decidedly pro-Byzantine. They desired to remain well-connected to the Empire. Another faction, republican in nature, believed in continuing along a course towards practical independence. The other main faction was pro-Frankish. Supported mostly by clergy (in line with [[Pope|papal]] sympathies of the time), they looked towards the new [[Carolingian]] king of the [[Franks]], [[Pepin the Short]], as the best provider of defence against the Lombards. A minor, pro-Lombard faction was opposed to close ties with any of these further-off powers and interested in maintaining peace with the neighbouring (and surrounding, but for the sea) Lombard kingdom.\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n[[File:The Venetia c 840 AD.jpg|thumb|The Venetia c 840 AD]]\nThe successors of Obelerio inherited a united Venice. By the ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' (803\u2013814), the two emperors had recognised that Venice belonged to the Byzantine sphere of influence. Many centuries later, the Venetians claimed that the treaty had recognised Venetian ''de facto'' independence, but the truth of this claim is doubted by modern scholars. A Byzantine fleet sailed to Venice in 807 and deposed the Doge, replacing him with a Byzantine governor. Nevertheless, during the reign of the Participazio family, Venice grew into its modern form.\n\nThough Heraclean by birth, [[Agnello Participazio|Agnello]], the first Participazio doge, was an early immigrant to Rialto and his dogeship was marked by the expansion of Venice towards the sea via the construction of bridges, canals, bulwarks, fortifications, and stone buildings. The modern Venice, at one with the sea, was being born. Agnello was succeeded by his son [[Giustiniano Participazio|Giustiniano]], who stole the remains of [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]] from [[Alexandria]], took them to Venice, and made him the republic's [[patron saint]]. According to tradition, Saint Mark was the founder of the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]].\n\nWith the patriarch's flight to [[Grado, Italy|Grado]] after the [[Lombards#Invasion and conquest of the Italian peninsula|Lombard invasion]], the patriarchate split into two: one on the mainland, under the control of the Lombards and later the [[Franks]], and the other in [[Patriarch of Grado|Grado]] on the lagoons and the areas under Byzantine control. This would later become the [[Patriarchate of Venice]]. With the apostle's reliquiae in its hands, Venice could again claim to be the rightful heir of Aquileia. In the Late Middle Ages, this would be the basis for legitimizing the seizure of the patriarchy's vast territories in [[Friuli]] and eastwards.\n\n[[File:Republik Venedig.png|thumb|Map of the Venetian Republic, ''circa'' 1000]]\n\nDuring the reign of the successor of the Participazio, [[Pietro Tradonico]], Venice began to establish its military might, which would influence many a later crusade and dominate the Adriatic for centuries. Tradonico secured the sea by fighting [[Narentines|Narentine]] and [[Muslim conquests|Saracen]] pirates. Tradonico's reign was long and successful (837\u201364), but he was succeeded by the Participazio and a dynasty appeared to have been finally established. Around 841, the Republic of Venice sent a fleet of 60 galleys (each carrying 200 men) to assist the Byzantines in driving the [[Arabs]] from [[Crotone]], but it failed.<ref name=\"AD 841\">J. J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 32.</ref> In 1000, [[Pietro II Orseolo]] sent a fleet of 6 ships to defeat the [[Narentine]] pirates from [[Dalmatia]].<ref name=\"AD 1000\">J. J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 53.</ref>\n\n===High Middle Ages===\n{{See also|Stato da M\u00e0r}}\n[[File:Repubblica di Venezia.png|thumb|The Republic of Venice in the 15th\u201316th centuries.\n{{Legend|#910000|Venice}}\n{{Legend|#CD0D08|Territory at the start of the 15th c.}}\n{{Legend|#EF0000|Subsequent acquisitions}}\n{{Legend|#FFA8A8|Temporary acquisitions}}\n{{Legend|#F3F1A6|Seas dominated by Venetians at the start of the 16th c.}}\n{{Legend-line|#FBBD04 solid 2px|Primary Venetian routes}}\n{{spaces|2}}{{Colorbull|#D200D2}}{{spaces|2}}Primary Venetian trading colonies<br />\n{{Legend|#AADC78|[[Ottoman Empire]]}}\n]]\n\nIn the [[High Middle Ages]], Venice became extremely wealthy through its control of trade between Europe and the [[Levant]], and it began to expand into the [[Adriatic Sea]] and beyond. In 1084, [[Domenico Selvo]] personally led a fleet against the [[Normans]], but he was defeated and lost nine great [[galley]]s, the largest and most heavily armed ships in the Venetian war [[naval fleet|fleet]].<ref name=\"AD 1084\">J. J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 72.</ref> Venice was involved in the [[Crusades]] almost from the very beginning. Two hundred Venetian ships assisted in capturing the coastal cities of [[Syria]] after the [[First Crusade]]. In 1110, [[Ordelafo Faliero]] personally commanded a Venetian fleet of 100 ships to assist [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]] of [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] and [[Sigurd the Crusader|Sigurd I Magnusson]], king of [[Hereditary Kingdom of Norway|Norway]] in capturing the city of [[Siege of Sidon|Sidon]] (in present-day [[Lebanon]]).<ref name=\"AD 1110\">J. J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 83.</ref> In 1123, they were granted virtual autonomy in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] through the ''[[Pactum Warmundi]]''.<ref name=\"AD 1099\">J. J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 77.</ref>\n\nThe Venetians also gained extensive trading privileges in the Byzantine Empire during the 12th century, and their ships often provided the Empire with a navy. In 1182, a vicious [[massacre of the Latins|anti-Western riot]] broke out in [[Constantinople]] targeting Latins, and Venetians in particular. Many in the Empire had become jealous of Venetian power and influence, thus when the pretender [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] marched on the city, Venetian property was seized and the owners imprisoned or banished, an act which humiliated and angered the republic.\n\nIn 1183, the city of [[Zadar|Zara]] ({{lang-hr|Zadar}}) successfully rebelled against Venetian rule. The city then put itself under the dual protection of the papacy and [[Emeric, King of Hungary]]. The Dalmatians separated from Hungary by a treaty in 1199, and they paid Hungary with a portion of [[Macedonia (theme)|Macedonia]]. In 1201, the city of Zara recognized Emeric as overlord.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Tyre being blockaded by the Venetian fleet and besieged by Crusader knighthood.PNG|[[Venetian Crusade|Siege of Tyre (1124)]] in the [[Holy Land]]\nFile:Crusaders attack Constantinople.jpg|[[Siege of Constantinople (1203)]]\nFile:Marco Polo traveling.JPG|Voyage of [[Marco Polo]] into the Far East during the [[Pax Mongolica]]\nFile:Arsenale (Venice) - First Ancient Greek lion.jpg|The [[Piraeus Lion]] in Venice, in front of the [[Venetian Arsenal]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== 13th century ===\nThe leaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1202\u201304) contracted with Venice to provide a fleet for transportation to the Levant. When the crusaders were unable to pay for the ships, Doge [[Enrico Dandolo]] offered transport if the crusaders were to [[Siege of Zara|capture Zara]], a city that had rebelled years ago and was a concurrent to Venice. Upon the capture of Zara, the crusade was again diverted, this time to Constantinople. [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|The capture and sacking of Constantinople]] has been described as one of the most profitable and disgraceful sacks of a city in history.<ref name=\"Phillips\">Phillips, ''The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople'', Introduction, xiii.</ref>\n\nThe Venetians claimed much of the plunder, including the famous [[horses of Saint Mark|four bronze horses]] that were brought back to adorn [[St Mark's Basilica]]. Furthermore, in the [[Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae|subsequent partition]] of the Byzantine lands, Venice gained a great deal of territory in the [[Aegean Sea]], theoretically amounting to three-eighths of the Byzantine Empire. It also acquired the islands of [[Crete]] ([[Kingdom of Candia|Candia]]) and [[Euboea]] ([[Triarchy of Negroponte|Negroponte]]); the present core city of [[Chania]] on Crete is largely of Venetian construction, built atop the [[ruins]] of the ancient city of [[Kydonia|Cydonia]].<ref>[http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10881/cydonia.html#fieldnotes C.Michael Hogan, ''Cydonia'', Modern Antiquarian, 23 January 2008]</ref>\n\nThe Aegean islands came to form the Venetian [[Duchy of the Archipelago]].

J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 176\u2013180.</ref> From 1350 to 1381, Venice fought an intermittent [[Venetian\u2013Genoese Wars|war with the Genoese]]. Initially defeated, they devastated the Genoese fleet at the [[Battle of Chioggia]] in 1380 and retained their prominent position in eastern Mediterranean affairs at the expense of Genoa's declining empire.\n\n===14th century===\n{{See also|Venetian Renaissance}}\nIn 1363, the [[revolt of Saint Titus]] against Venetian rule broke out in the overseas colony of [[Kingdom of Candia|Candia]] (Crete). It was a joint effort of Venetian colonists and Cretan nobles who attempted to create an independent state. Venice sent a multinational mercenary army which soon regained control of the major cities. However, Venice was not able to fully reconquer Crete until 1368.\n\nBy the end of the 14th century, Venice had acquired mainland possessions in [[Italy]], annexing [[Mestre]] and [[Vittorio Veneto|Serravalle]] in 1337, [[Treviso]] and [[Bassano del Grappa]] in 1339, [[Oderzo]] in 1380, and [[Vittorio Veneto|Ceneda]] in 1389.\n\n===15th century: The Expansion in the Mainland===\n\nIn the early 15th century, the republic began to expand onto the ''[[Domini di Terraferma|Terraferma]].'' Thus, [[Vicenza]], [[Belluno]], and [[Feltre]] were acquired in 1404, and [[Padua]], [[Verona]], and [[Este, Veneto|Este]] in 1405.\n\nVenice expanded as well along the [[Dalmatia]]n coast from [[Istria]] to [[Albania]], which was acquired from King [[Ladislaus of Naples]] during the civil war in Hungary. Ladislaus was about to lose the conflict and had decided to escape to Naples, but before doing so, he agreed to sell his now practically forfeit rights on the Dalmatian cities for the reduced sum of 100,000 ducats.\n\n[[File:Accademia - Procession in piazza San Marco by Gentile Bellini.jpg|thumb|Procession in [[Piazza San Marco|St Mark's Square]] by [[Gentile Bellini]] in 1496]]Venice exploited the situation and quickly installed nobility to govern the area, for example, Count Filippo Stipanov in Zara. This move by the Venetians was a response to the threatening expansion of [[Giangaleazzo Visconti]], [[Duke of Milan]]. Control over the northeast main land routes was also a necessity for the safety of the trades. By 1410, Venice had a navy of 3,300 ships (manned by 36,000 men) and taken over most of what is now the Veneto, including the cities of Verona (which swore its loyalty in the [[Devotion of Verona to Venice]] in 1405) and Padua.<ref name=\"AD 1400\">J.

At the expiration of the truce in 1420, Venice immediately invaded the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (State)|Patriarchate of Aquileia]], and subjected [[Trogir|Tra\u00f9]], [[Split (city)|Spalato]], [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]], and other Dalmatian cities.

The wars with Venice resumed after the Ottomans captured the [[Siege of Jajce|Kingdom of Bosnia]] in 1463, and lasted until a favorable peace treaty was signed in 1479 just after the troublesome [[siege of Shkodra]]. In 1480 (now no longer hampered by the Venetian fleet), the Ottomans [[Siege of Rhodes (1480)|besieged Rhodes]] and [[Battle of Otranto|briefly captured Otranto]]. By 1490, the population of Venice had risen to about 180,000 people.<ref name=\"AD 1490\">J. J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 494.</ref>\n\n[[Turkish-Venetian War (1499-1503)|War with the Ottomans]] resumed from 1499 to 1503. In 1499, Venice allied itself with [[Louis XII of France]] against [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], gaining [[Cremona]]. In the same year, the Ottoman sultan moved to attack [[Nafpaktos|Lepanto]] by land, and sent a large fleet to support his offensive by sea. [[Antonio Grimani]], more a businessman and diplomat than a sailor, was defeated in the sea [[battle of Zonchio]] in 1499. The Turks once again sacked [[Friuli]]. Preferring peace to total war both against the Turks and by sea, Venice surrendered the bases of Lepanto, [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]], [[Methoni, Messenia|Modon]], and [[Koroni|Coron]].\n\nVenice's attention was diverted from its usual maritime position by the delicate situation in [[Romagna]], then one of the richest lands in Italy, which was nominally part of the [[Papal States]], but effectively divided into a series of small lordships which were difficult for Rome's troops to control. Eager to take some of Venice's lands, all neighbouring powers joined in the [[League of Cambrai]] in 1508, under the leadership of [[Pope Julius II]]. The pope wanted [[Romagna]]; Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]: [[Friuli]] and [[Veneto]]; Spain: the [[Apulia]]n ports; the [[king of France]]: Cremona; the [[king of Hungary]]: Dalmatia, and each one some of another's part. The offensive against the huge army enlisted by Venice was launched from France.\n\n[[File:Palamidi castle - Agios Andreas Bastion.jpg|thumb|left|The Venetian fort of [[Palamidi]] in [[Nafplion]], [[Greece]], one of many forts that secured Venetian [[trade route]]s in the Eastern [[Mediterranean]].]]\n\nOn 14 May 1509, Venice was crushingly defeated at the [[battle of Agnadello]], in the Ghiara d'Adda, marking one of the most delicate points in Venetian history. French and imperial troops were occupying Veneto, but Venice managed to extricate itself through diplomatic efforts. The Apulian ports were ceded in order to come to terms with Spain, and Pope Julius II soon recognized the danger brought by the eventual destruction of Venice (then the only Italian power able to face kingdoms like France or empires like the Ottomans).\n\nThe citizens of the mainland rose to the cry of \"Marco, Marco\", and [[Andrea Gritti]] recaptured Padua in July 1509, successfully defending it against the besieging imperial troops. Spain and the pope broke off their alliance with France, and Venice regained Brescia and Verona from France, also. After seven years of ruinous war, the Serenissima regained its mainland dominions west to the Adda River. Although the defeat had turned into a victory, the events of 1509 marked the end of the Venetian expansion.\n\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer =\n | image1 = Giambattista Tiepolo - Venezia riceve l'omaggio di Nettuno - 1745-50.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 = [[Giovan Battista Tiepolo]]'s ''Neptune offers the wealth of the sea to Venice'', 1748\u201350, an allegory of the power of the Republic of Venice, as the wealth and power of the ''Serenissima'' was based on the control of the sea\n | image2 = Jacopo Tintoretto 037.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 = [[Sebastiano Venier]] commander of the Venetian fleet at [[Battle of Lepanto|Lepanto (1571)]]\n }}\n\nIn 1489, the first year of Venetian control of Cyprus, Turks attacked the [[Karpasia Peninsula]], pillaging and taking captives to be sold into slavery. In 1539, the Turkish fleet attacked and destroyed [[Limassol]]. Fearing the ever-expanding Ottoman Empire, the Venetians had fortified [[Famagusta]], [[Nicosia]], and [[Kyrenia]], but most other cities were easy prey. By 1563, the population of Venice had dropped to about 168,000 people.<ref name=\"AD 1490\"/>\n\nIn the summer of 1570, the Turks struck again, but this time with a [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573)|full-scale invasion]] rather than a raid. About 60,000 troops, including cavalry and artillery, under the command of [[Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha|Mustafa Pasha]] landed unopposed near Limassol on 2 July 1570, and laid siege to Nicosia.

De Vries attributes this decline to the loss of the spice trade (to the Dutch and English), a declining uncompetitive textile industry, competition in book publishing due to a rejuvenated Catholic Church, the adverse impact of the Thirty Years' War on Venice's key trade partners, and the increasing cost of cotton and silk imports to Venice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://admin.cambridge.org/academic/subjects/history/european-history-after-1450/economy-europe-age-crisis-16001750?format=AR|title=Europe in an age of crisis 1600\u20131750|last=De Vries|first=Jan|date=|website=Cambridge University Press|page=26|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-09-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 1606, a conflict between Venice and the [[Holy See]] began with the arrest of two clerics accused of petty crimes, and with a law restricting the Church's right to enjoy and acquire landed property. [[Pope Paul V]] held that these provisions were contrary to canon law, and demanded that they be repealed. When this was refused, he placed Venice under an [[papal interdict|interdict]]. The Republic paid no attention to the interdict or the act of [[excommunication]], and ordered its priests to carry out their ministry. It was supported in its decisions by the Servite monk [[Paolo Sarpi]], a sharp polemical writer who was nominated to be the Signoria's adviser on theology and canon law in 1606. The interdict was lifted after a year, when France intervened and proposed a formula of compromise. Venice was satisfied with reaffirming the principle that no citizen was superior to the normal processes of law.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe latter half of the 17th century also had prolonged wars with the [[Ottoman Empire]]; in the [[Cretan War (1645\u20131669)]], after a heroic siege that lasted 24 years, Venice lost its major overseas possession, the island of Crete, while it made some advances in Dalmatia. In 1684, however, taking advantage of the Ottoman involvement against Austria in the [[Great Turkish War]], the republic initiated the [[Morean War]], which lasted until 1699 and in which it was able to conquer the [[Morea]] peninsula in southern Greece.\n\n===18th century: decline===\nThese gains did not last, however; in December 1714, the Turks began the last [[Turkish\u2013Venetian War (1714\u20131718)|Turkish\u2013Venetian War]], when the Morea was \"without any of those supplies which are so desirable even in countries where aid is near at hand which are not liable to attack from the sea\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zorzi |first1=Alvise |author-link1=Alvise Zorzi |year=1983 |title=Venice: The Golden Age, 697 \u2013 1797 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IP5OAAAAMAAJ&q=%22even+in+countries+where+aid+is+near+at+hand+%22+%22attack+from+the+sea%22&dq=%22even+in+countries+where+aid+is+near+at+hand+%22+%22attack+from+the+sea%22 |location=New York |publisher=Abbeville Press |page=255 |isbn=0896594068 |access-date=16 September 2017 }}</ref>\n[[File:The Republic of Venice .png|thumb|The Republic of Venice around 1700]]\nThe Turks took the islands of [[Tinos]] and [[Aegina]], crossed the isthmus, and took [[Corinth]]. [[Daniele Dolfin]], commander of the Venetian fleet, thought it better to save the fleet than risk it for the Morea. When he eventually arrived on the scene, Nauplia, Modon, Corone, and Malvasia had fallen. Levkas in the [[Ionian islands]], and the bases of [[Spinalonga]] and [[Souda|Suda]] on Crete, which still remained in Venetian hands, were abandoned. The Turks finally landed on [[Corf\u00f9]], but its defenders managed to throw them back.\n\nIn the meantime, the Turks had suffered a grave defeat by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrians]] in the [[Battle of Petrovaradin]] on 5 August 1716. Venetian naval efforts in the [[Aegean Sea]] and the [[Dardanelles]] in 1717 and 1718, however, met with little success. With the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] (21 July 1718), Austria made large territorial gains, but Venice lost the Morea, for which its small gains in [[Ottoman Albania|Albania]] and Dalmatia were little compensation. This was the last war with the Ottoman Empire. By the year 1792, the once-great Venetian merchant fleet had declined to a mere 309 [[cargo ship|merchantmen]].<ref name=\"AD 1794\">J. J.

The army under [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] crossed the frontiers of neutral Venice in pursuit of the enemy. By the end of the year, the French troops were occupying the Venetian state up to the [[Adige]]. Vicenza, Cadore and Friuli were held by the Austrians. With the campaigns of the next year, Napoleon aimed for the Austrian possessions across the [[Alps]]. In the preliminaries to the [[Treaty of Leoben|Peace of Leoben]], the terms of which remained secret, the Austrians were to take the Venetian possessions in the [[Balkans]] as the price of peace (18 April 1797), while France required the [[Lombardy|Lombard]] part of the State.\n\nAfter Napoleon's ultimatum, [[Ludovico Manin|Doge Ludovico Manin]] surrendered unconditionally on 12 May, and [[abdication|abdicated]], while the Major Council declared the end of the republic. According to Bonaparte's orders, the public powers passed to a provisional municipality under the French military governor. On 17 October, France and Austria signed the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], agreeing to share all the territory of the ancient republic, with a new border just west of the [[Adige River]]. Italian democrats, especially young poet [[Ugo Foscolo]], viewed the treaty as a betrayal. The metropolitan part of the disbanded republic became an Austrian territory, under the name of [[Venetian Province]] (''Provincia Veneta'' in Italian, ''Provinz Venedig'' in German).\n\n===Legacy===\nThough the economic vitality of the Venetian Republic had started to decline since the 16th century due to the movement of international trade towards the Atlantic, its political regime still appeared in the 18th century as a model for the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Zadar PortaTerraferma.jpg|Relief of the Venetian Lion on the Landward Gate in Zara ([[Zadar]]), capital of the [[Venetian Dalmatia]]\nFile:Pore\u010d005.jpg|Relief of the Venetian Lion in Parenzo ([[Pore\u010d]])\nFile:Piazza dei Signori (Vicenza) - Statue of the Lion of Saint Mark.jpg|[[Vicenza]], [[Piazza dei Signori, Vicenza|Piazza dei Signori]].\nFile:Udine-colonna del Leone marciano di piazza Libert\u00e0.jpg|[[Udine]], [[Piazza Libert\u00e0]].\nFile:Fotothek-df ge 0000212-Verona.jpg|[[Piazza delle Erbe, Verona]]\nFile:PA130122.JPG|Relief of the Venetian Lion in Cattaro ([[Kotor]])\nFile:Frangokastello Kastell - Eingangstor L\u00f6we.jpg|Relief of the Venetian Lion on Candia ([[Crete]])\nFile:Venetian blazon in Corfu.jpg|([[Corfu]]) Venetian [[blazon]] with the [[Lion of Saint Mark]], as frequently found on the [[New Fortress]] walls.\n</gallery>\n\n[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was hired in July 1743 as Secretary by comte de Montaigu, who had been named Ambassador of the French in Venice. This short experience, nevertheless, awakened the interest of Rousseau to the policy, which led him to design a large book of political philosophy.<ref>[[Raymond Trousson]], ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau'', Tallandier, p. 452</ref> After the ''[[Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men]]'' (1755), he published ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762).\n\n==Government==\nIn the early years of the republic, the [[Doge of Venice]] ruled Venice in an [[autocracy|autocratic fashion]], but later his powers were limited by the ''[[promissione ducale]]'', a pledge he had to take when elected. As a result, powers were shared with the ''Maggior Consiglio'' or [[Great Council of Venice|Great Council]], composed of 480 members taken from patrician families, so that in the words of [[Marino Sanuto the Younger|Marin Sanudo]], \"[The Doge] could do nothing without the Great Council and the Great Council could do nothing without him\".\n\nVenice followed a [[mixed government]] model, combining monarchy in the doge, aristocracy in the senate, republic of Rialto families in the major council, and a democracy in the [[concio (Venice)|concio]].<ref>''The Political Ideas of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]'', Dino Bigongiari ed., Hafner Publishing Company, NY, 1953. p.

In 1223, these institutions were combined into the ''[[Signoria of Venice|Signoria]]'', which consisted of the doge, the Minor Council, and the three leaders of the ''Quarantia''. The Signoria was the central body of government, representing the continuity of the republic as shown in the expression: \"si \u00e8 morto il Doge, no la Signoria\" (\"If the Doge is dead, the Signoria is not\").\n\nDuring the late 14th and early 15th centuries, the Signoria was supplemented by a number of boards of ''savii'' (\"wise men\"): the six ''[[savii del consiglio]]'', who formulated and executed government policy; the five ''[[savii di terraferma]]'', responsible for military affairs and the defence of the [[Terraferma]]; and the five ''[[savii ai ordini]]'', responsible for the navy, commerce, and the [[Stato da Mar|overseas territories]]. Together, the Signoria and the ''savii'' formed the [[Full College]] (''Pien Collegio''), the ''de facto'' [[executive body]] of the Republic.\n\nIn 1229, the ''[[Consiglio dei Pregadi]]'' or Senate, was formed, being 60 members elected by the major council.<ref name = \"CE\">''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15333a.htm Venice]\", p. 602.</ref> These developments left the doge with little personal power and put actual authority in the hands of the Great Council.\n\n[[File:Francesco Guardi 034.jpg|thumb|''The hearing given by the Doge in the Sala del Collegio in Doge's Palace'' by [[Francesco Guardi]], 1775\u201380]]\nIn 1310, a [[Council of Ten]] was established, becoming the central political body whose members operated in secret. Around 1600, its dominance over the major council was considered a threat and efforts were made in the council and elsewhere to reduce its powers, with limited success.\n\nIn 1454, the Supreme Tribunal of the three state inquisitors was established to guard the security of the republic. By means of espionage, [[counterespionage]], internal [[surveillance]], and a network of informers, they ensured that Venice did not come under the rule of a single \"signore\", as many other Italian cities did at the time. One of the inquisitors \u2013 popularly known as ''Il Rosso'' (\"the red one\") because of his scarlet robe \u2013 was chosen from the Doge's councillors, two \u2013 popularly known as ''I negri'' (\"the black ones\") because of their black robes \u2013 were chosen from the Council of Ten. The Supreme Tribunal gradually assumed some of the powers of the Council of Ten.<ref name = \"CE\"/>\n\nIn 1556, the ''provveditori ai beni inculti'' were also created for the improvement of agriculture by increasing the area under cultivation and encouraging private investment in agricultural improvement. The consistent rise in the price of grain during the 16th century encouraged the transfer of capital from trade to the land.\n\n==Military==\nDuring the Medieval period, the republic's military was composed of the following elements:\n#''Forza ordinari'' (ordinary force), the oarsmen drafted from the citizens of the City of Venice; everyone from the age of 20\u201370 was obligated to serve in it. However, generally only a twelfth was active.\n#''Forza sussidiaria'' (subsidiary force), the military force drawn from Venice's overseas possessions.\n#''Forza straordinari'' (extraordinary force), the mercenary part of the army; Venetian galleys tended to employ thirty mercenary crossbowmen.

It lasted from 697 [[AD]] until 1797 AD. Centered on the [[lagoon]] communities of the prosperous city of [[Venice]], the republic grew into a [[Economic history of Venice|trading power]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and strengthened this position in the [[Renaissance]]. Citizens spoke the still-surviving [[Venetian language]], although publishing in (Florentine) Italian became the norm during the Renaissance.\n\nThe Venetian [[city state]] was founded as a safe haven for the people escaping persecution in mainland Europe after the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} In its early years, it prospered on the [[salt trade]]. In subsequent centuries, the city state established a [[thalassocracy]]. It dominated trade on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], including commerce between Europe and North Africa, as well as Asia. The Venetian [[navy]] was used in the [[Crusades]], most notably in the [[Fourth Crusade]]. However, Venice perceived Rome as an enemy and maintained high levels of religious and ideological independence personified by the [[Patriarch of Venice]] and a highly-developed independent publishing industry that served as a haven from Roman Catholic censorship for many centuries. Venice achieved territorial conquests along the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Venice became home to an extremely wealthy merchant class, who patronized renowned art and architecture along the city's lagoons. Venetian merchants were influential financiers in Europe. The city was also the birthplace of great European explorers, such as [[Marco Polo]], as well as [[Baroque]] composers such as [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and [[Benedetto Marcello]].\n\nThe republic was ruled by the [[Doge of Venice|Doge]], who was elected by members of the [[Great Council of Venice]], the city-state's [[parliament]]. The ruling class was an [[oligarchy]] of merchants and aristocrats. Venice and other Italian maritime republics played a key role in fostering capitalism. Venetian citizens generally supported the system of governance. The city-state enforced strict laws and employed ruthless tactics in its prisons.\n\nThe opening of new trade routes to the Americas and the East Indies via the Atlantic Ocean marked the beginning of Venice's decline as a powerful maritime republic. The city state suffered defeats from the navy of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1797, the republic was plundered by retreating Austrian and then French forces, following an invasion by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and the Republic of Venice was split into the Austrian [[Venetian Province]], the [[Cisalpine Republic]], a French client state, and the Ionian [[French departments of Greece]]. Venice became part of a [[Italian unification|unified Italy]] in the 19th century.\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n{{anchor|Etymology}}\n\n==Name==\nIt was formally known as the Most Serene Republic of Venice ({{lang-it|Serenissima Repubblica di Venezia}}, {{lang-vec|Seren\u00ecsima Rep\u00f9blica V\u00e8neta}}, or {{lang-vec|Rep\u00f9blica de Venesia}}) and is often referred to as ''La Serenissima'', in reference to its title as one of the \"[[Most Serene Republic]]s\".\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Republic of Venice|Timeline of the Republic of Venice}}\nDuring the 5th century, [[Triveneto|northeast Italy]] was devastated by the Germanic barbarian invasions. A large number of the inhabitants moved to the coastal [[lagoon]]s, looking for a safer place to live. Here they established a collection of lagoon communities, stretching over about {{cvt|130|km}} from [[Chioggia]] in the south to [[Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Grado]] in the north, who banded together for mutual defence from the [[Lombards]], [[Huns]], and other invading peoples as the power of the [[Western Roman Empire]] dwindled in northern Italy.\n\nThese communities were subjected to the authority of the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n[[File:The Venetia c 600 AD.jpg|thumb|The Venetia c 600 AD]]\n\nAt some point in the first decades of the eighth century, the people of the [[Byzantine]] province of Venice elected their first leader [[Orso Ipato|Ursus]] (or Orso Ipato), who was confirmed by [[Constantinople]] and given the titles of ''[[hypatus]]'' and ''[[dux]]''. He was the first historical [[Doge of Venice]]. Tradition, however, first attested in the early 11th century, states that the Venetians first proclaimed one [[Paolo Lucio Anafesto|Anafestus Paulicius]] duke in 697, though this story dates to no earlier than the chronicle of [[John, deacon of Venice|John the Deacon]]. Whichever the case, the first doges had their power base in [[Eraclea|Heraclea]].\n\n===Rise===\n\nUrsus's successor, [[Teodato Ipato|Deusdedit]], moved his seat from Heraclea to [[Malamocco]] in the 740s. He was the son of Ursus and represented the attempt of his father to establish a dynasty. Such attempts were more than commonplace among the doges of the first few centuries of Venetian history, but all were ultimately unsuccessful. During the reign of Deusdedit, Venice became the only remaining Byzantine possession in the north and the changing politics of the [[Frankish Empire]] began to change the factional divisions within Venetia.\n\nOne faction was decidedly pro-Byzantine. They desired to remain well-connected to the Empire. Another faction, republican in nature, believed in continuing along a course towards practical independence. The other main faction was pro-Frankish. Supported mostly by clergy (in line with [[Pope|papal]] sympathies of the time), they looked towards the new [[Carolingian]] king of the [[Franks]], [[Pepin the Short]], as the best provider of defence against the Lombards. A minor, pro-Lombard faction was opposed to close ties with any of these further-off powers and interested in maintaining peace with the neighbouring (and surrounding, but for the sea) Lombard kingdom.\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n[[File:The Venetia c 840 AD.jpg|thumb|The Venetia c 840 AD]]\nThe successors of Obelerio inherited a united Venice. By the ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' (803\u2013814), the two emperors had recognised that Venice belonged to the Byzantine sphere of influence. Many centuries later, the Venetians claimed that the treaty had recognised Venetian ''de facto'' independence, but the truth of this claim is doubted by modern scholars. A Byzantine fleet sailed to Venice in 807 and deposed the Doge, replacing him with a Byzantine governor. Nevertheless, during the reign of the Participazio family, Venice grew into its modern form.\n\nThough Heraclean by birth, [[Agnello Participazio|Agnello]], the first Participazio doge, was an early immigrant to Rialto and his dogeship was marked by the expansion of Venice towards the sea via the construction of bridges, canals, bulwarks, fortifications, and stone buildings. The modern Venice, at one with the sea, was being born. Agnello was succeeded by his son [[Giustiniano Participazio|Giustiniano]], who stole the remains of [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]] from [[Alexandria]], took them to Venice, and made him the republic's [[patron saint]]. According to tradition, Saint Mark was the founder of the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]].\n\nWith the patriarch's flight to [[Grado, Italy|Grado]] after the [[Lombards#Invasion and conquest of the Italian peninsula|Lombard invasion]], the patriarchate split into two: one on the mainland, under the control of the Lombards and later the [[Franks]], and the other in [[Patriarch of Grado|Grado]] on the lagoons and the areas under Byzantine control. This would later become the [[Patriarchate of Venice]]. With the apostle's reliquiae in its hands, Venice could again claim to be the rightful heir of Aquileia. In the Late Middle Ages, this would be the basis for legitimizing the seizure of the patriarchy's vast territories in [[Friuli]] and eastwards.\n\n[[File:Republik Venedig.png|thumb|Map of the Venetian Republic, ''circa'' 1000]]\n\nDuring the reign of the successor of the Participazio, [[Pietro Tradonico]], Venice began to establish its military might, which would influence many a later crusade and dominate the Adriatic for centuries. Tradonico secured the sea by fighting [[Narentines|Narentine]] and [[Muslim conquests|Saracen]] pirates. Tradonico's reign was long and successful (837\u201364), but he was succeeded by the Participazio and a dynasty appeared to have been finally established. Around 841, the Republic of Venice sent a fleet of 60 galleys (each carrying 200 men) to assist the Byzantines in driving the [[Arabs]] from [[Crotone]], but it failed.<ref name=\"AD 841\">J. J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 32.</ref> In 1000, [[Pietro II Orseolo]] sent a fleet of 6 ships to defeat the [[Narentine]] pirates from [[Dalmatia]].<ref name=\"AD 1000\">J. J.

In 1084, [[Domenico Selvo]] personally led a fleet against the [[Normans]], but he was defeated and lost nine great [[galley]]s, the largest and most heavily armed ships in the Venetian war [[naval fleet|fleet]].<ref name=\"AD 1084\">J. J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 72.</ref> Venice was involved in the [[Crusades]] almost from the very beginning. Two hundred Venetian ships assisted in capturing the coastal cities of [[Syria]] after the [[First Crusade]]. In 1110, [[Ordelafo Faliero]] personally commanded a Venetian fleet of 100 ships to assist [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]] of [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] and [[Sigurd the Crusader|Sigurd I Magnusson]], king of [[Hereditary Kingdom of Norway|Norway]] in capturing the city of [[Siege of Sidon|Sidon]] (in present-day [[Lebanon]]).<ref name=\"AD 1110\">J. J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 83.</ref> In 1123, they were granted virtual autonomy in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] through the ''[[Pactum Warmundi]]''.<ref name=\"AD 1099\">J. J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 77.</ref>\n\nThe Venetians also gained extensive trading privileges in the Byzantine Empire during the 12th century, and their ships often provided the Empire with a navy. In 1182, a vicious [[massacre of the Latins|anti-Western riot]] broke out in [[Constantinople]] targeting Latins, and Venetians in particular. Many in the Empire had become jealous of Venetian power and influence, thus when the pretender [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] marched on the city, Venetian property was seized and the owners imprisoned or banished, an act which humiliated and angered the republic.\n\nIn 1183, the city of [[Zadar|Zara]] ({{lang-hr|Zadar}}) successfully rebelled against Venetian rule. The city then put itself under the dual protection of the papacy and [[Emeric, King of Hungary]]. The Dalmatians separated from Hungary by a treaty in 1199, and they paid Hungary with a portion of [[Macedonia (theme)|Macedonia]]. In 1201, the city of Zara recognized Emeric as overlord.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Tyre being blockaded by the Venetian fleet and besieged by Crusader knighthood.PNG|[[Venetian Crusade|Siege of Tyre (1124)]] in the [[Holy Land]]\nFile:Crusaders attack Constantinople.jpg|[[Siege of Constantinople (1203)]]\nFile:Marco Polo traveling.JPG|Voyage of [[Marco Polo]] into the Far East during the [[Pax Mongolica]]\nFile:Arsenale (Venice) - First Ancient Greek lion.jpg|The [[Piraeus Lion]] in Venice, in front of the [[Venetian Arsenal]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== 13th century ===\nThe leaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1202\u201304) contracted with Venice to provide a fleet for transportation to the Levant. When the crusaders were unable to pay for the ships, Doge [[Enrico Dandolo]] offered transport if the crusaders were to [[Siege of Zara|capture Zara]], a city that had rebelled years ago and was a concurrent to Venice. Upon the capture of Zara, the crusade was again diverted, this time to Constantinople. [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|The capture and sacking of Constantinople]] has been described as one of the most profitable and disgraceful sacks of a city in history.<ref name=\"Phillips\">Phillips, ''The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople'', Introduction, xiii.</ref>\n\nThe Venetians claimed much of the plunder, including the famous [[horses of Saint Mark|four bronze horses]] that were brought back to adorn [[St Mark's Basilica]]. Furthermore, in the [[Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae|subsequent partition]] of the Byzantine lands, Venice gained a great deal of territory in the [[Aegean Sea]], theoretically amounting to three-eighths of the Byzantine Empire. It also acquired the islands of [[Crete]] ([[Kingdom of Candia|Candia]]) and [[Euboea]] ([[Triarchy of Negroponte|Negroponte]]); the present core city of [[Chania]] on Crete is largely of Venetian construction, built atop the [[ruins]] of the ancient city of [[Kydonia|Cydonia]].<ref>[http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10881/cydonia.html#fieldnotes C.Michael Hogan, ''Cydonia'', Modern Antiquarian, 23 January 2008]</ref>\n\nThe Aegean islands came to form the Venetian [[Duchy of the Archipelago]].

J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 176\u2013180.</ref> From 1350 to 1381, Venice fought an intermittent [[Venetian\u2013Genoese Wars|war with the Genoese]]. Initially defeated, they devastated the Genoese fleet at the [[Battle of Chioggia]] in 1380 and retained their prominent position in eastern Mediterranean affairs at the expense of Genoa's declining empire.\n\n===14th century===\n{{See also|Venetian Renaissance}}\nIn 1363, the [[revolt of Saint Titus]] against Venetian rule broke out in the overseas colony of [[Kingdom of Candia|Candia]] (Crete). It was a joint effort of Venetian colonists and Cretan nobles who attempted to create an independent state. Venice sent a multinational mercenary army which soon regained control of the major cities. However, Venice was not able to fully reconquer Crete until 1368.\n\nBy the end of the 14th century, Venice had acquired mainland possessions in [[Italy]], annexing [[Mestre]] and [[Vittorio Veneto|Serravalle]] in 1337, [[Treviso]] and [[Bassano del Grappa]] in 1339, [[Oderzo]] in 1380, and [[Vittorio Veneto|Ceneda]] in 1389.\n\n===15th century: The Expansion in the Mainland===\n\nIn the early 15th century, the republic began to expand onto the ''[[Domini di Terraferma|Terraferma]].'' Thus, [[Vicenza]], [[Belluno]], and [[Feltre]] were acquired in 1404, and [[Padua]], [[Verona]], and [[Este, Veneto|Este]] in 1405.\n\nVenice expanded as well along the [[Dalmatia]]n coast from [[Istria]] to [[Albania]], which was acquired from King [[Ladislaus of Naples]] during the civil war in Hungary. Ladislaus was about to lose the conflict and had decided to escape to Naples, but before doing so, he agreed to sell his now practically forfeit rights on the Dalmatian cities for the reduced sum of 100,000 ducats.\n\n[[File:Accademia - Procession in piazza San Marco by Gentile Bellini.jpg|thumb|Procession in [[Piazza San Marco|St Mark's Square]] by [[Gentile Bellini]] in 1496]]Venice exploited the situation and quickly installed nobility to govern the area, for example, Count Filippo Stipanov in Zara. This move by the Venetians was a response to the threatening expansion of [[Giangaleazzo Visconti]], [[Duke of Milan]]. Control over the northeast main land routes was also a necessity for the safety of the trades. By 1410, Venice had a navy of 3,300 ships (manned by 36,000 men) and taken over most of what is now the Veneto, including the cities of Verona (which swore its loyalty in the [[Devotion of Verona to Venice]] in 1405) and Padua.<ref name=\"AD 1400\">J. J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 269.</ref>\n\nThe situation in Dalmatia had been settled in 1408 by a truce with King [[Sigismund of Hungary]], but the difficulties of Hungary finally granted to the republic the consolidation of its Adriatic dominions. At the expiration of the truce in 1420, Venice immediately invaded the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (State)|Patriarchate of Aquileia]], and subjected [[Trogir|Tra\u00f9]], [[Split (city)|Spalato]], [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]], and other Dalmatian cities.  In [[Lombardy]], Venice acquired [[Brescia]] in 1426, [[Bergamo]] in 1428, and [[Cremona]] in 1499.\n\nSlaves were plentiful in the Italian city-states as late as the 15th century. Between 1414 and 1423, some 10,000 [[slavery|slaves]], imported from [[Caffa]], were sold in Venice.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Witzenrath|first1=Christoph|title=Eurasian Slavery, Ransom and Abolition in World History, 1200\u20131860|date=November 2015|edition=New|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-1472410580|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=imrnCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=n+1414+and+1423,+some+10,000+%5B%5Bslavery%7Cslaves%5D%5D+were+sold+in+Venice,#v=onepage&q=n%201414%20and%201423%2C%20some%2010%2C000%20%5B%5Bslavery%7Cslaves%5D%5D%20were%20sold%20in%20Venice%2C&f=false|accessdate=23 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1481, Venice retook nearby [[Rovigo]], which it had held previously from 1395 to 1438; in February 1489, the island of [[Cyprus]], previously a [[crusader state]] (the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]]), was added to Venice's holdings.\n\n===League of Cambrai, the loss of Cyprus, and Battle of Lepanto===\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] started sea campaigns as early as 1423, when it waged a seven-year war with the Venetian Republic over maritime control of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]], and the Adriatic Seas. The wars with Venice resumed after the Ottomans captured the [[Siege of Jajce|Kingdom of Bosnia]] in 1463, and lasted until a favorable peace treaty was signed in 1479 just after the troublesome [[siege of Shkodra]]. In 1480 (now no longer hampered by the Venetian fleet), the Ottomans [[Siege of Rhodes (1480)|besieged Rhodes]] and [[Battle of Otranto|briefly captured Otranto]]. By 1490, the population of Venice had risen to about 180,000 people.<ref name=\"AD 1490\">J. J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 494.</ref>\n\n[[Turkish-Venetian War (1499-1503)|War with the Ottomans]] resumed from 1499 to 1503. In 1499, Venice allied itself with [[Louis XII of France]] against [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], gaining [[Cremona]]. In the same year, the Ottoman sultan moved to attack [[Nafpaktos|Lepanto]] by land, and sent a large fleet to support his offensive by sea. [[Antonio Grimani]], more a businessman and diplomat than a sailor, was defeated in the sea [[battle of Zonchio]] in 1499. The Turks once again sacked [[Friuli]]. Preferring peace to total war both against the Turks and by sea, Venice surrendered the bases of Lepanto, [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]], [[Methoni, Messenia|Modon]], and [[Koroni|Coron]].\n\nVenice's attention was diverted from its usual maritime position by the delicate situation in [[Romagna]], then one of the richest lands in Italy, which was nominally part of the [[Papal States]], but effectively divided into a series of small lordships which were difficult for Rome's troops to control. Eager to take some of Venice's lands, all neighbouring powers joined in the [[League of Cambrai]] in 1508, under the leadership of [[Pope Julius II]]. The pope wanted [[Romagna]]; Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]: [[Friuli]] and [[Veneto]]; Spain: the [[Apulia]]n ports; the [[king of France]]: Cremona; the [[king of Hungary]]: Dalmatia, and each one some of another's part. The offensive against the huge army enlisted by Venice was launched from France.\n\n[[File:Palamidi castle - Agios Andreas Bastion.jpg|thumb|left|The Venetian fort of [[Palamidi]] in [[Nafplion]], [[Greece]], one of many forts that secured Venetian [[trade route]]s in the Eastern [[Mediterranean]].]]\n\nOn 14 May 1509, Venice was crushingly defeated at the [[battle of Agnadello]], in the Ghiara d'Adda, marking one of the most delicate points in Venetian history. French and imperial troops were occupying Veneto, but Venice managed to extricate itself through diplomatic efforts. The Apulian ports were ceded in order to come to terms with Spain, and Pope Julius II soon recognized the danger brought by the eventual destruction of Venice (then the only Italian power able to face kingdoms like France or empires like the Ottomans).\n\nThe citizens of the mainland rose to the cry of \"Marco, Marco\", and [[Andrea Gritti]] recaptured Padua in July 1509, successfully defending it against the besieging imperial troops. Spain and the pope broke off their alliance with France, and Venice regained Brescia and Verona from France, also. After seven years of ruinous war, the Serenissima regained its mainland dominions west to the Adda River. Although the defeat had turned into a victory, the events of 1509 marked the end of the Venetian expansion.\n\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer =\n | image1 = Giambattista Tiepolo - Venezia riceve l'omaggio di Nettuno - 1745-50.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 = [[Giovan Battista Tiepolo]]'s ''Neptune offers the wealth of the sea to Venice'', 1748\u201350, an allegory of the power of the Republic of Venice, as the wealth and power of the ''Serenissima'' was based on the control of the sea\n | image2 = Jacopo Tintoretto 037.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 = [[Sebastiano Venier]] commander of the Venetian fleet at [[Battle of Lepanto|Lepanto (1571)]]\n }}\n\nIn 1489, the first year of Venetian control of Cyprus, Turks attacked the [[Karpasia Peninsula]], pillaging and taking captives to be sold into slavery. In 1539, the Turkish fleet attacked and destroyed [[Limassol]]. Fearing the ever-expanding Ottoman Empire, the Venetians had fortified [[Famagusta]], [[Nicosia]], and [[Kyrenia]], but most other cities were easy prey. By 1563, the population of Venice had dropped to about 168,000 people.<ref name=\"AD 1490\"/>\n\nIn the summer of 1570, the Turks struck again, but this time with a [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573)|full-scale invasion]] rather than a raid. About 60,000 troops, including cavalry and artillery, under the command of [[Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha|Mustafa Pasha]] landed unopposed near Limassol on 2 July 1570, and laid siege to Nicosia. In an orgy of victory on the day that the city fell \u2013 9 September 1570 \u2013 20,000 Nicosians were put to death, and every church, public building, and palace was looted.<ref>{{cite book | last=Turnbull | first=Stephen | title=The Ottoman Empire 1326\u20131699| publisher=Routledge | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-415-96913-0 |page=58}}</ref> Word of the massacre spread, and a few days later, Mustafa took Kyrenia without having to fire a shot. Famagusta, however, resisted and put up a defense that lasted from September 1570 until August 1571.\n\nThe fall of Famagusta marked the beginning of the Ottoman period in Cyprus. Two months later, the naval forces of the [[Holy League (Mediterranean)|Holy League]], composed mainly of Venetian, [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[Papal states|papal]] ships under the command of [[Don John of Austria]], defeated the Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]].<ref>Melisseides Ioannes A.

De Vries attributes this decline to the loss of the spice trade (to the Dutch and English), a declining uncompetitive textile industry, competition in book publishing due to a rejuvenated Catholic Church, the adverse impact of the Thirty Years' War on Venice's key trade partners, and the increasing cost of cotton and silk imports to Venice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://admin.cambridge.org/academic/subjects/history/european-history-after-1450/economy-europe-age-crisis-16001750?format=AR|title=Europe in an age of crisis 1600\u20131750|last=De Vries|first=Jan|date=|website=Cambridge University Press|page=26|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-09-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 1606, a conflict between Venice and the [[Holy See]] began with the arrest of two clerics accused of petty crimes, and with a law restricting the Church's right to enjoy and acquire landed property. [[Pope Paul V]] held that these provisions were contrary to canon law, and demanded that they be repealed. When this was refused, he placed Venice under an [[papal interdict|interdict]]. The Republic paid no attention to the interdict or the act of [[excommunication]], and ordered its priests to carry out their ministry. It was supported in its decisions by the Servite monk [[Paolo Sarpi]], a sharp polemical writer who was nominated to be the Signoria's adviser on theology and canon law in 1606. The interdict was lifted after a year, when France intervened and proposed a formula of compromise. Venice was satisfied with reaffirming the principle that no citizen was superior to the normal processes of law.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe latter half of the 17th century also had prolonged wars with the [[Ottoman Empire]]; in the [[Cretan War (1645\u20131669)]], after a heroic siege that lasted 24 years, Venice lost its major overseas possession, the island of Crete, while it made some advances in Dalmatia. In 1684, however, taking advantage of the Ottoman involvement against Austria in the [[Great Turkish War]], the republic initiated the [[Morean War]], which lasted until 1699 and in which it was able to conquer the [[Morea]] peninsula in southern Greece.\n\n===18th century: decline===\nThese gains did not last, however; in December 1714, the Turks began the last [[Turkish\u2013Venetian War (1714\u20131718)|Turkish\u2013Venetian War]], when the Morea was \"without any of those supplies which are so desirable even in countries where aid is near at hand which are not liable to attack from the sea\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zorzi |first1=Alvise |author-link1=Alvise Zorzi |year=1983 |title=Venice: The Golden Age, 697 \u2013 1797 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IP5OAAAAMAAJ&q=%22even+in+countries+where+aid+is+near+at+hand+%22+%22attack+from+the+sea%22&dq=%22even+in+countries+where+aid+is+near+at+hand+%22+%22attack+from+the+sea%22 |location=New York |publisher=Abbeville Press |page=255 |isbn=0896594068 |access-date=16 September 2017 }}</ref>\n[[File:The Republic of Venice .png|thumb|The Republic of Venice around 1700]]\nThe Turks took the islands of [[Tinos]] and [[Aegina]], crossed the isthmus, and took [[Corinth]]. [[Daniele Dolfin]], commander of the Venetian fleet, thought it better to save the fleet than risk it for the Morea. When he eventually arrived on the scene, Nauplia, Modon, Corone, and Malvasia had fallen. Levkas in the [[Ionian islands]], and the bases of [[Spinalonga]] and [[Souda|Suda]] on Crete, which still remained in Venetian hands, were abandoned. The Turks finally landed on [[Corf\u00f9]], but its defenders managed to throw them back.\n\nIn the meantime, the Turks had suffered a grave defeat by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrians]] in the [[Battle of Petrovaradin]] on 5 August 1716. Venetian naval efforts in the [[Aegean Sea]] and the [[Dardanelles]] in 1717 and 1718, however, met with little success. With the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] (21 July 1718), Austria made large territorial gains, but Venice lost the Morea, for which its small gains in [[Ottoman Albania|Albania]] and Dalmatia were little compensation. This was the last war with the Ottoman Empire. By the year 1792, the once-great Venetian merchant fleet had declined to a mere 309 [[cargo ship|merchantmen]].<ref name=\"AD 1794\">J. J.

J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', p. 615.</ref> In spring 1796, [[Piedmont]] fell, and the Austrians were beaten from [[Montenotte Department|Montenotte]] to [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]]. The army under [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] crossed the frontiers of neutral Venice in pursuit of the enemy. By the end of the year, the French troops were occupying the Venetian state up to the [[Adige]]. Vicenza, Cadore and Friuli were held by the Austrians. With the campaigns of the next year, Napoleon aimed for the Austrian possessions across the [[Alps]]. In the preliminaries to the [[Treaty of Leoben|Peace of Leoben]], the terms of which remained secret, the Austrians were to take the Venetian possessions in the [[Balkans]] as the price of peace (18 April 1797), while France required the [[Lombardy|Lombard]] part of the State.\n\nAfter Napoleon's ultimatum, [[Ludovico Manin|Doge Ludovico Manin]] surrendered unconditionally on 12 May, and [[abdication|abdicated]], while the Major Council declared the end of the republic. According to Bonaparte's orders, the public powers passed to a provisional municipality under the French military governor. On 17 October, France and Austria signed the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], agreeing to share all the territory of the ancient republic, with a new border just west of the [[Adige River]]. Italian democrats, especially young poet [[Ugo Foscolo]], viewed the treaty as a betrayal. The metropolitan part of the disbanded republic became an Austrian territory, under the name of [[Venetian Province]] (''Provincia Veneta'' in Italian, ''Provinz Venedig'' in German).\n\n===Legacy===\nThough the economic vitality of the Venetian Republic had started to decline since the 16th century due to the movement of international trade towards the Atlantic, its political regime still appeared in the 18th century as a model for the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Zadar PortaTerraferma.jpg|Relief of the Venetian Lion on the Landward Gate in Zara ([[Zadar]]), capital of the [[Venetian Dalmatia]]\nFile:Pore\u010d005.jpg|Relief of the Venetian Lion in Parenzo ([[Pore\u010d]])\nFile:Piazza dei Signori (Vicenza) - Statue of the Lion of Saint Mark.jpg|[[Vicenza]], [[Piazza dei Signori, Vicenza|Piazza dei Signori]].\nFile:Udine-colonna del Leone marciano di piazza Libert\u00e0.jpg|[[Udine]], [[Piazza Libert\u00e0]].\nFile:Fotothek-df ge 0000212-Verona.jpg|[[Piazza delle Erbe, Verona]]\nFile:PA130122.JPG|Relief of the Venetian Lion in Cattaro ([[Kotor]])\nFile:Frangokastello Kastell - Eingangstor L\u00f6we.jpg|Relief of the Venetian Lion on Candia ([[Crete]])\nFile:Venetian blazon in Corfu.jpg|([[Corfu]]) Venetian [[blazon]] with the [[Lion of Saint Mark]], as frequently found on the [[New Fortress]] walls.\n</gallery>\n\n[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was hired in July 1743 as Secretary by comte de Montaigu, who had been named Ambassador of the French in Venice.

As a result, powers were shared with the ''Maggior Consiglio'' or [[Great Council of Venice|Great Council]], composed of 480 members taken from patrician families, so that in the words of [[Marino Sanuto the Younger|Marin Sanudo]], \"[The Doge] could do nothing without the Great Council and the Great Council could do nothing without him\".\n\nVenice followed a [[mixed government]] model, combining monarchy in the doge, aristocracy in the senate, republic of Rialto families in the major council, and a democracy in the [[concio (Venice)|concio]].<ref>''The Political Ideas of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]'', Dino Bigongiari ed., Hafner Publishing Company, NY, 1953. p.

In 1223, these institutions were combined into the ''[[Signoria of Venice|Signoria]]'', which consisted of the doge, the Minor Council, and the three leaders of the ''Quarantia''. The Signoria was the central body of government, representing the continuity of the republic as shown in the expression: \"si \u00e8 morto il Doge, no la Signoria\" (\"If the Doge is dead, the Signoria is not\").\n\nDuring the late 14th and early 15th centuries, the Signoria was supplemented by a number of boards of ''savii'' (\"wise men\"): the six ''[[savii del consiglio]]'', who formulated and executed government policy; the five ''[[savii di terraferma]]'', responsible for military affairs and the defence of the [[Terraferma]]; and the five ''[[savii ai ordini]]'', responsible for the navy, commerce, and the [[Stato da Mar|overseas territories]]. Together, the Signoria and the ''savii'' formed the [[Full College]] (''Pien Collegio''), the ''de facto'' [[executive body]] of the Republic.\n\nIn 1229, the ''[[Consiglio dei Pregadi]]'' or Senate, was formed, being 60 members elected by the major council.<ref name = \"CE\">''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15333a.htm Venice]\", p. 602.</ref> These developments left the doge with little personal power and put actual authority in the hands of the Great Council.\n\n[[File:Francesco Guardi 034.jpg|thumb|''The hearing given by the Doge in the Sala del Collegio in Doge's Palace'' by [[Francesco Guardi]], 1775\u201380]]\nIn 1310, a [[Council of Ten]] was established, becoming the central political body whose members operated in secret. Around 1600, its dominance over the major council was considered a threat and efforts were made in the council and elsewhere to reduce its powers, with limited success.\n\nIn 1454, the Supreme Tribunal of the three state inquisitors was established to guard the security of the republic. By means of espionage, [[counterespionage]], internal [[surveillance]], and a network of informers, they ensured that Venice did not come under the rule of a single \"signore\", as many other Italian cities did at the time. One of the inquisitors \u2013 popularly known as ''Il Rosso'' (\"the red one\") because of his scarlet robe \u2013 was chosen from the Doge's councillors, two \u2013 popularly known as ''I negri'' (\"the black ones\") because of their black robes \u2013 were chosen from the Council of Ten. The Supreme Tribunal gradually assumed some of the powers of the Council of Ten.<ref name = \"CE\"/>\n\nIn 1556, the ''provveditori ai beni inculti'' were also created for the improvement of agriculture by increasing the area under cultivation and encouraging private investment in agricultural improvement. The consistent rise in the price of grain during the 16th century encouraged the transfer of capital from trade to the land.\n\n==Military==\nDuring the Medieval period, the republic's military was composed of the following elements:\n#''Forza ordinari'' (ordinary force), the oarsmen drafted from the citizens of the City of Venice; everyone from the age of 20\u201370 was obligated to serve in it. However, generally only a twelfth was active.\n#''Forza sussidiaria'' (subsidiary force), the military force drawn from Venice's overseas possessions.\n#''Forza straordinari'' (extraordinary force), the mercenary part of the army; Venetian galleys tended to employ thirty mercenary crossbowmen.

The integers are also a [[Free abelian group|free abelian]] group, although all free groups of rank <math>\\geq 2</math> are non-abelian. A free group on a two-element set ''S'' occurs in the proof of the [[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]] and is described there.\n\nOn the other hand, any nontrivial finite group cannot be free, since the elements of a free generating set of a free group have infinite order.\n\nIn [[algebraic topology]], the [[fundamental group]] of a [[bouquet of circles|bouquet of ''k'' circles]] (a set of ''k'' loops having only one point in common) is the free group on a set of ''k'' elements.\n\n== Construction ==\nThe '''free group''' ''F<sub>S</sub>'' with '''free generating set''' ''S'' can be constructed as follows.  ''S'' is a set of symbols, and we suppose for every ''s'' in ''S'' there is a corresponding \"inverse\" symbol, ''s''<sup>&minus;1</sup>, in a set ''S''<sup>&minus;1</sup>.   Let ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''S''&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;''S''<sup>&minus;1</sup>, and define a '''[[word (group theory)|word]]''' in ''S'' to be any written product of elements of ''T''. That is, a word in ''S'' is an element of the [[monoid]] generated by ''T''. The empty word is the word with no symbols at all. For example, if ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''a'',&nbsp;''b'',&nbsp;''c''}, then ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''a'',&nbsp;''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>,&nbsp;''b'',&nbsp;''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>,&nbsp;''c'',&nbsp;''c''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}, and\n:<math>a b^3 c^{-1} c a^{-1} c\\,</math>\nis a word in ''S''.\n\nIf an element of ''S'' lies immediately next to its inverse, the word may be simplified by omitting the c,&nbsp;c<sup>&minus;1</sup> pair:\n:<math>a b^3 c^{-1} c a^{-1} c\\;\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\;a b^3 \\, a^{-1} c.</math>\nA word that cannot be simplified further is called '''reduced'''.\n\nThe free group ''F<sub>S</sub>'' is defined to be the group of all reduced words in ''S'', with [[concatenation]] of words (followed by reduction if necessary) as group operation.  The identity is the empty word.\n\nA word is called '''cyclically reduced''', if its first and last letter are not inverse to each other. Every word is [[Inner automorphism|conjugate]] to a cyclically reduced word, and a cyclically reduced conjugate of a cyclically reduced word is a cyclic permutation of the letters in the word.  For instance ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''abcb'' is not cyclically reduced, but is conjugate to ''abc'', which is cyclically reduced.  The only cyclically reduced conjugates of ''abc'' are ''abc'', ''bca'', and ''cab''.\n\n== Universal property ==\nThe free group ''F<sub>S</sub>'' is the [[Universal (mathematics)|universal]] group generated by the set ''S''.  This can be formalized by the following [[universal property]]: given any function {{mvar|f}} from ''S'' to a group ''G'', there exists a unique [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] ''\u03c6'':&nbsp;''F<sub>S</sub>''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''G'' making the following [[commutative diagram|diagram]] commute (where the unnamed mapping denotes the [[Inclusion_map|inclusion]] from ''S'' into ''F<sub>S</sub>''):\n[[Image:Free Group Universal.svg|center|100px]]\nThat is, homomorphisms ''F<sub>S</sub>''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''G'' are in one-to-one correspondence with functions ''S''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''G''. For a non-free group, the presence of [[group presentation|relations]] would restrict the possible images of the generators under a homomorphism.\n\nTo see how this relates to the constructive definition, think of the mapping from ''S'' to ''F<sub>S</sub>'' as sending each symbol to a word consisting of that symbol. To construct ''\u03c6'' for given {{mvar|f}}, first note that ''\u03c6'' sends the empty word to the identity of ''G'' and it has to agree with {{mvar|f}} on the elements of ''S''. For the remaining words (consisting of more than one symbol) ''\u03c6'' can be uniquely extended since it is a homomorphism, i.e., ''\u03c6''(''ab'') = ''\u03c6''(''a'') ''\u03c6''(''b'').\n\nThe above property characterizes free groups up to [[isomorphism]], and is sometimes used as an alternative definition.  It is known as the [[universal property]] of free groups, and the generating set ''S'' is called a '''basis''' for ''F<sub>S</sub>''.  The basis for a free group is not uniquely determined.\n\nBeing characterized by a universal property is the standard feature of [[free object]]s in [[universal algebra]].  In the language of [[category theory]], the construction of the free group (similar to most constructions of free objects) is a [[functor]] from the [[category of sets]] to the [[category of groups]].  This functor is [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from groups to sets.\n\n==Facts and theorems==\nSome properties of free groups follow readily from the definition:\n\n#Any group ''G'' is the homomorphic image of some free group F(''S''). Let ''S'' be a set of ''[[Generating set of a group|generators]]'' of ''G''. The natural map ''f'': F(''S'') \u2192 ''G'' is an [[epimorphism]], which proves the claim. Equivalently, ''G'' is isomorphic to a [[quotient group]] of some free group F(''S''). The kernel of ''\u03c6'' is a set of ''relations'' in the [[Presentation of a group|presentation]] of ''G''. If ''S'' can be chosen to be finite here, then ''G'' is called '''finitely generated'''.\n#If ''S'' has more than one element, then F(''S'') is not [[abelian group|abelian]], and in fact the [[center of a group|center]] of F(''S'') is trivial (that is, consists only of the identity element).\n#Two free groups F(''S'') and F(''T'') are isomorphic if and only if ''S'' and ''T'' have the same [[cardinality]]. This cardinality is called the '''rank''' of the free group ''F''. Thus for every cardinal number ''k'', there is, [[up to]] isomorphism, exactly one free group of rank ''k''.\n#A free group of finite rank ''n'' > 1 has an [[exponential growth|exponential]] [[growth rate (group theory)|growth rate]] of order 2''n'' \u2212 1.\n\nA few other related results are:\n#The [[Nielsen\u2013Schreier theorem]]:  Every [[subgroup]] of a free group is free.\n#A free group of rank ''k'' clearly has subgroups of every rank less than ''k''. Less obviously, a (''nonabelian!'') free group of rank at least 2 has subgroups of all [[countable set|countable]] ranks.\n#The [[commutator subgroup]] of a free group of rank ''k'' > 1 has infinite rank; for example for F(''a'',''b''), it is freely generated by the [[commutator]]s [''a''<sup>''m''</sup>, ''b''<sup>''n''</sup>] for non-zero ''m'' and ''n''.\n#The free group in two elements is [[SQ universal]]; the above follows as any SQ universal group has subgroups of all countable ranks.\n#Any group that [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] on a tree, [[free action|freely]] and preserving the [[oriented graph|orientation]], is a free group of countable rank (given by 1 plus the [[Euler characteristic]] of the [[Group action (mathematics)|quotient]] [[graph theory|graph]]).\n#The [[Cayley graph]] of a free group of finite rank, with respect to a free generating set, is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] on which the group acts freely, preserving the orientation.\n#The [[groupoid]] approach to these results, given in the work by P.J. Higgins below, is kind of extracted from an approach using [[covering space]]s. It allows more powerful results, for example on [[Grushko's theorem]], and a normal form for the fundamental groupoid of a graph of groups. In this approach there is considerable use of free groupoids on a directed graph.\n# [[Grushko's theorem]] has the consequence that if a subset ''B'' of a free group ''F'' on  ''n'' elements generates ''F'' and has ''n'' elements, then ''B'' generates ''F'' freely.\n\n== Free abelian group ==\n{{further|Free abelian group}}\n\nThe free abelian group on a set ''S'' is defined via its universal property in the analogous way, with obvious modifications:\nConsider a pair (''F'', ''\u03c6''), where ''F'' is an abelian group and ''\u03c6'': ''S'' \u2192 ''F'' is a function. ''F'' is said to be the '''free abelian group on ''S'' with respect to ''\u03c6'' ''' if for any abelian group ''G'' and any function ''\u03c8'': ''S'' \u2192 ''G'', there exists a unique homomorphism ''f'': ''F'' \u2192 ''G'' such that\n\n:''f''(''\u03c6''(''s'')) = ''\u03c8''(''s''), for all ''s'' in ''S''.\n\nThe free abelian group on ''S'' can be explicitly identified as the free group F(''S'') modulo the subgroup generated by its commutators, [F(''S''), F(''S'')], i.e.\nits [[abelianisation]]. In other words, the free abelian group on ''S'' is the set of words that are distinguished only up to the order of letters. The rank of a free group can therefore also be defined as the rank of its abelianisation as a free abelian group.\n\n==Tarski's problems==\nAround 1945, [[Alfred Tarski]] asked whether the free groups on two or more generators have the same [[model theory|first order theory]], and whether this theory is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]]. {{harvtxt|Sela|2006}} answered the first question by showing that any two nonabelian free groups have the same first order theory, and {{harvtxt|Kharlampovich|Myasnikov|2006}} answered both questions, showing that this theory is decidable.\n\nA similar unsolved (as of 2011) question in [[free probability theory]] asks whether the [[von Neumann group algebra]]s  of any two non-abelian finitely generated free groups are isomorphic.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Generating set of a group]]\n* [[Presentation of a group]]\n* [[Nielsen transformation]], a factorization of elements of the [[automorphism group of a free group]]\n* [[Normal form for free groups and free product of groups]]\n* [[Free product]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite journal|last=Kharlampovich|first=Olga|last2=Myasnikov|first2=Alexei|title=Elementary theory of free non-abelian groups|journal=[[Journal of Algebra]]|volume=302|year=2006|issue=2|pages=451\u2013552|doi=10.1016/j.jalgebra.2006.03.033|url=http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~olga/p3new.PDF|ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->|mr=2293770|access-date=2015-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021134745/http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~olga/p3new.PDF|archive-date=2016-10-21|url-status=dead}} \n*W.

The integers are also a [[Free abelian group|free abelian]] group, although all free groups of rank <math>\\geq 2</math> are non-abelian. A free group on a two-element set ''S'' occurs in the proof of the [[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]] and is described there.\n\nOn the other hand, any nontrivial finite group cannot be free, since the elements of a free generating set of a free group have infinite order.\n\nIn [[algebraic topology]], the [[fundamental group]] of a [[bouquet of circles|bouquet of ''k'' circles]] (a set of ''k'' loops having only one point in common) is the free group on a set of ''k'' elements.\n\n== Construction ==\nThe '''free group''' ''F<sub>S</sub>'' with '''free generating set''' ''S'' can be constructed as follows.  ''S'' is a set of symbols, and we suppose for every ''s'' in ''S'' there is a corresponding \"inverse\" symbol, ''s''<sup>&minus;1</sup>, in a set ''S''<sup>&minus;1</sup>.   Let ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''S''&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;''S''<sup>&minus;1</sup>, and define a '''[[word (group theory)|word]]''' in ''S'' to be any written product of elements of ''T''. That is, a word in ''S'' is an element of the [[monoid]] generated by ''T''. The empty word is the word with no symbols at all. For example, if ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''a'',&nbsp;''b'',&nbsp;''c''}, then ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''a'',&nbsp;''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>,&nbsp;''b'',&nbsp;''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>,&nbsp;''c'',&nbsp;''c''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}, and\n:<math>a b^3 c^{-1} c a^{-1} c\\,</math>\nis a word in ''S''.\n\nIf an element of ''S'' lies immediately next to its inverse, the word may be simplified by omitting the c,&nbsp;c<sup>&minus;1</sup> pair:\n:<math>a b^3 c^{-1} c a^{-1} c\\;\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\;a b^3 \\, a^{-1} c.</math>\nA word that cannot be simplified further is called '''reduced'''.\n\nThe free group ''F<sub>S</sub>'' is defined to be the group of all reduced words in ''S'', with [[concatenation]] of words (followed by reduction if necessary) as group operation.  The identity is the empty word.\n\nA word is called '''cyclically reduced''', if its first and last letter are not inverse to each other. Every word is [[Inner automorphism|conjugate]] to a cyclically reduced word, and a cyclically reduced conjugate of a cyclically reduced word is a cyclic permutation of the letters in the word.  For instance ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''abcb'' is not cyclically reduced, but is conjugate to ''abc'', which is cyclically reduced.  The only cyclically reduced conjugates of ''abc'' are ''abc'', ''bca'', and ''cab''.\n\n== Universal property ==\nThe free group ''F<sub>S</sub>'' is the [[Universal (mathematics)|universal]] group generated by the set ''S''.  This can be formalized by the following [[universal property]]: given any function {{mvar|f}} from ''S'' to a group ''G'', there exists a unique [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] ''\u03c6'':&nbsp;''F<sub>S</sub>''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''G'' making the following [[commutative diagram|diagram]] commute (where the unnamed mapping denotes the [[Inclusion_map|inclusion]] from ''S'' into ''F<sub>S</sub>''):\n[[Image:Free Group Universal.svg|center|100px]]\nThat is, homomorphisms ''F<sub>S</sub>''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''G'' are in one-to-one correspondence with functions ''S''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''G''. For a non-free group, the presence of [[group presentation|relations]] would restrict the possible images of the generators under a homomorphism.\n\nTo see how this relates to the constructive definition, think of the mapping from ''S'' to ''F<sub>S</sub>'' as sending each symbol to a word consisting of that symbol. To construct ''\u03c6'' for given {{mvar|f}}, first note that ''\u03c6'' sends the empty word to the identity of ''G'' and it has to agree with {{mvar|f}} on the elements of ''S''. For the remaining words (consisting of more than one symbol) ''\u03c6'' can be uniquely extended since it is a homomorphism, i.e., ''\u03c6''(''ab'') = ''\u03c6''(''a'') ''\u03c6''(''b'').\n\nThe above property characterizes free groups up to [[isomorphism]], and is sometimes used as an alternative definition.  It is known as the [[universal property]] of free groups, and the generating set ''S'' is called a '''basis''' for ''F<sub>S</sub>''.  The basis for a free group is not uniquely determined.\n\nBeing characterized by a universal property is the standard feature of [[free object]]s in [[universal algebra]].  In the language of [[category theory]], the construction of the free group (similar to most constructions of free objects) is a [[functor]] from the [[category of sets]] to the [[category of groups]].  This functor is [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from groups to sets.\n\n==Facts and theorems==\nSome properties of free groups follow readily from the definition:\n\n#Any group ''G'' is the homomorphic image of some free group F(''S''). Let ''S'' be a set of ''[[Generating set of a group|generators]]'' of ''G''. The natural map ''f'': F(''S'') \u2192 ''G'' is an [[epimorphism]], which proves the claim. Equivalently, ''G'' is isomorphic to a [[quotient group]] of some free group F(''S''). The kernel of ''\u03c6'' is a set of ''relations'' in the [[Presentation of a group|presentation]] of ''G''. If ''S'' can be chosen to be finite here, then ''G'' is called '''finitely generated'''.\n#If ''S'' has more than one element, then F(''S'') is not [[abelian group|abelian]], and in fact the [[center of a group|center]] of F(''S'') is trivial (that is, consists only of the identity element).\n#Two free groups F(''S'') and F(''T'') are isomorphic if and only if ''S'' and ''T'' have the same [[cardinality]]. This cardinality is called the '''rank''' of the free group ''F''. Thus for every cardinal number ''k'', there is, [[up to]] isomorphism, exactly one free group of rank ''k''.\n#A free group of finite rank ''n'' > 1 has an [[exponential growth|exponential]] [[growth rate (group theory)|growth rate]] of order 2''n'' \u2212 1.\n\nA few other related results are:\n#The [[Nielsen\u2013Schreier theorem]]:  Every [[subgroup]] of a free group is free.\n#A free group of rank ''k'' clearly has subgroups of every rank less than ''k''. Less obviously, a (''nonabelian!'') free group of rank at least 2 has subgroups of all [[countable set|countable]] ranks.\n#The [[commutator subgroup]] of a free group of rank ''k'' > 1 has infinite rank; for example for F(''a'',''b''), it is freely generated by the [[commutator]]s [''a''<sup>''m''</sup>, ''b''<sup>''n''</sup>] for non-zero ''m'' and ''n''.\n#The free group in two elements is [[SQ universal]]; the above follows as any SQ universal group has subgroups of all countable ranks.\n#Any group that [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] on a tree, [[free action|freely]] and preserving the [[oriented graph|orientation]], is a free group of countable rank (given by 1 plus the [[Euler characteristic]] of the [[Group action (mathematics)|quotient]] [[graph theory|graph]]).\n#The [[Cayley graph]] of a free group of finite rank, with respect to a free generating set, is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] on which the group acts freely, preserving the orientation.\n#The [[groupoid]] approach to these results, given in the work by P.J. Higgins below, is kind of extracted from an approach using [[covering space]]s. It allows more powerful results, for example on [[Grushko's theorem]], and a normal form for the fundamental groupoid of a graph of groups. In this approach there is considerable use of free groupoids on a directed graph.\n# [[Grushko's theorem]] has the consequence that if a subset ''B'' of a free group ''F'' on  ''n'' elements generates ''F'' and has ''n'' elements, then ''B'' generates ''F'' freely.\n\n== Free abelian group ==\n{{further|Free abelian group}}\n\nThe free abelian group on a set ''S'' is defined via its universal property in the analogous way, with obvious modifications:\nConsider a pair (''F'', ''\u03c6''), where ''F'' is an abelian group and ''\u03c6'': ''S'' \u2192 ''F'' is a function. ''F'' is said to be the '''free abelian group on ''S'' with respect to ''\u03c6'' ''' if for any abelian group ''G'' and any function ''\u03c8'': ''S'' \u2192 ''G'', there exists a unique homomorphism ''f'': ''F'' \u2192 ''G'' such that\n\n:''f''(''\u03c6''(''s'')) = ''\u03c8''(''s''), for all ''s'' in ''S''.\n\nThe free abelian group on ''S'' can be explicitly identified as the free group F(''S'') modulo the subgroup generated by its commutators, [F(''S''), F(''S'')], i.e.\nits [[abelianisation]]. In other words, the free abelian group on ''S'' is the set of words that are distinguished only up to the order of letters. The rank of a free group can therefore also be defined as the rank of its abelianisation as a free abelian group.\n\n==Tarski's problems==\nAround 1945, [[Alfred Tarski]] asked whether the free groups on two or more generators have the same [[model theory|first order theory]], and whether this theory is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]]. {{harvtxt|Sela|2006}} answered the first question by showing that any two nonabelian free groups have the same first order theory, and {{harvtxt|Kharlampovich|Myasnikov|2006}} answered both questions, showing that this theory is decidable.\n\nA similar unsolved (as of 2011) question in [[free probability theory]] asks whether the [[von Neumann group algebra]]s  of any two non-abelian finitely generated free groups are isomorphic.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Generating set of a group]]\n* [[Presentation of a group]]\n* [[Nielsen transformation]], a factorization of elements of the [[automorphism group of a free group]]\n* [[Normal form for free groups and free product of groups]]\n* [[Free product]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite journal|last=Kharlampovich|first=Olga|last2=Myasnikov|first2=Alexei|title=Elementary theory of free non-abelian groups|journal=[[Journal of Algebra]]|volume=302|year=2006|issue=2|pages=451\u2013552|doi=10.1016/j.jalgebra.2006.03.033|url=http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~olga/p3new.PDF|ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->|mr=2293770|access-date=2015-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021134745/http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~olga/p3new.PDF|archive-date=2016-10-21|url-status=dead}} \n*W.
