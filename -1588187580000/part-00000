At the end of the trail is a diary belonging to Jimmy Sullivan, a young man missing since 1976 who appears to be the victim. The final pages of the diary contain several names and addresses; amongst them are Beth, Father Rob, Frankie C and Mr. Slater. Four seemingly unconnected people living very separate lives.

She is met by a woman who is in fact relieved that she might finally find out what happened to her son 39 years after he went missing. 'Frankie C' is identified as Sir Phillip Cross, the government's recently appointed entrepreneurial tzar, who denies ever having met Jimmy. 'Beth' is identified as Lizzie Wilton, living in Croydon and married to Ray, a second-generation Jamaican man. Lizzie also denies knowing Jimmy but is clearly a very different woman from who she was in the 70s before her marriage. 'Father Rob' is Robert Greaves who at the time of Jimmy's death was working in the local church to Arlingham House.

Did the businessman or any of the shady associates of his youth have anything to do with Jimmy's disappearance or murder? Meanwhile, Eric and Claire's anniversary gets under way.

Eric Slater is arrested, but denies all charges made against him. After some initial reluctance, Curtis agrees to help Ray go in search of Lizzie. Father Robert confesses that he was the one who stole money from the church charity fund, and that after his secret affair with JoJo, she became pregnant and he has been using the money to pay the way for his illegitimate child. Before the news breaks of Eric Slater's arrest, Sir Phillip Cross has already struck a deal with his son's Turkish contacts and before he is able to change his mind, the witness who came forward with evidence against him is killed in a house fire, made to look like an accident caused when the man 'fell asleep smoking'. Evidence found in Eric Slater's home links him to the location of the last known whereabouts of the second victim, and following the revelation that Jimmy had been selling himself for sex as a way of repaying the debt he owed to the Fenwicks, Cassie and Sunny finally realise that the connection between both murders may be Eric Slater's hidden hatred for homosexuals.\n|LineColor=000080\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=6\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title=Episode 6\n |DirectedBy=Andy Wilson\n |WrittenBy=Chris Lang\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2015|11|12|df=y}}\n |Viewers=6.01\n |ShortSummary= Father Robert's revelations prove to have lasting repercussions, especially for Caroline when she goes into premature labour.

Sunny identifies the watch's owner as David Walker, who disappeared in May 1990. Cassie and Sunny notify Tessa, his widow, who has remarried.  \n|LineColor=FF623B\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=8\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title= Episode 2\n |DirectedBy=Andy Wilson\n |WrittenBy=Chris Lang\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|1|12|df=y}}\n |Viewers=7.08\n |ShortSummary= As the investigation into David Walker's murder continues, the team try to decode a series of messages found on the victim's pager. One message appears to be an address in King's Cross, which is soon discovered to have been a brothel at the time of Walker's death. Cassie and Sunny interrogate Sara Mahmoud, who was known to have been working as a prostitute from the address at the time \u2013 but she denies even knowing Walker, and claims that she was on holiday in Italy at the time of the murder. A telephone number in the victim's diary leads Cassie and Sunny to Colin Osborne, who also denies ever having known Walker. Osborne, meanwhile, continues to feel the pressure from Tyler. Tessa Nixon's boss, Detective Superintendent Gill (Nathalie Armin), asks her to take restricted duties while the investigation takes its course, which she angrily refuses to do as she has not been named as a suspect in her husband's death. Cassie begins to suspect that her father, Martin, is hiding something from her when she discovers a train ticket in his pocket, and a series of unknown payments on his credit card.\n|LineColor=FF623B\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=9\n |EpisodeNumber2=3\n |Title= Episode 3\n |DirectedBy=Andy Wilson\n |WrittenBy=Chris Lang\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|1|19|df=y}}\n |Viewers=7.04\n |ShortSummary= The discovery that Walker was sexually abused during his time in primary education leads the team to suspect that the perpetrator, if still alive, would be in his early 80s. Sunny interviews Walker's best friend, James Gregory ([[Richard Hope (actor)|Richard Hope]]), who claims that in the days leading up to his death, Walker confronted the abuser, who denied being involved in any such abuse. Cassie visits the address found on the back of Walker's business card, and interviews Marion's mother and sister, Joy and Elise, who claim at the time of Walker's death, Marion was the only one living at the house and could be the only person to have given out the address. Checks on Marion's criminal history reveal she was arrested in 1988 for assaulting a police officer during a protest march, and that she was living at an address with a known IRA conspirator. Meanwhile, Sara is forced to tell her husband, Hassan, about her past life, and Colin reveals that he had a mental breakdown and was sectioned just days before Walker disappeared.\n|LineColor=FF623B\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=10\n |EpisodeNumber2=4\n |Title= Episode 4\n |DirectedBy=Andy Wilson\n |WrittenBy=Chris Lang\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|1|26|df=y}}\n |Viewers=6.52\n |ShortSummary= Sara's life begins to fall apart when her son overhears details from her secret past, and inadvertently manages to tell all of his friends. Meanwhile, Cassie discovers that Colin was sacked from his City job in 1989 for reportedly sexually assaulting one of his female colleagues during an office party, a fact which leads her to believe that Colin was framed for the attack. Meanwhile, Marion is suspended from work after Zoe absconds from her parents' care. As the investigation into Walker's past continues, Sunny discovers that he was heavily into S&M, and sexually attacked at least one woman whom he slept with. Concerns that his private fantasies may have spilt over into his charity work are confirmed when Ellen Price, a resident at one of the care homes where Walker volunteered, comes forward to tell the police that Walker interfered with her and other children at the home. Tyler continues to blackmail Colin, leading Simon to make a drastic decision. Paul, Tessa's second husband, fears that Jason may have inherited his father's traits. \n|LineColor=FF623B\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=11\n |EpisodeNumber2=5\n |Title= Episode 5\n |DirectedBy=Andy Wilson\n |WrittenBy=Chris Lang\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|2|2|df=y}}\n |Viewers=6.77\n |ShortSummary= Sara's long lost father turns up out of the blue with some long-buried secrets about her past. Colin is shocked to discover that the rape allegation made against him was concocted by David Walker, who paid the supposed victim \u00a35,000 to fake the story. Ellen Price revisits the location where Walker and his friends used to hold 'parties' where children were abused. Tessa's denial of David's activities is called into question when Ellen recalls David's wife having turned up at one of the parties, which forced a row in front of many of the guests. As Marion's home life continues to spiral, she tries to make things up with Zoe. Simon makes the heartbreaking decision to cease the adoption unless Colin can convince Tyler to back off. Sara's husband uncovers evidence which confirms she was in Naples at the time of the murder. With all of the possible suspects now carrying a solid alibi, Cassie and Sunny are stumped as to who the killer might be. Sunny tries to reveal his true feelings for Cassie.\n|LineColor=FF623B\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=12\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title= Episode 6\n |DirectedBy=Andy Wilson\n |WrittenBy=Chris Lang\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|2|9|df=y}}\n |Viewers=6.77\n |ShortSummary=With each of the suspects having a motive, opportunity or connection to David Walker, Cassie and Sunny try to join the dots to discover who actually killed him 25 years earlier. Though Sara has provided reliable evidence that she was in Italy when the murder took place, Cassie suspects that it is too good \u2013 that it is something put together by someone who knew that one day they would need an alibi. The team wonder whether the case is part of a wider revenge plan. On that new line of investigation, the team find that Sara and Colin had been in the same psychiatric hospital at the same time, and could have met then. The team's notion is that each one killed the abuser of another, not their own abuser. While Sara denies every possibility put to her by Cassie, the scenes are cut with Sara's father telling an opposite scenario of Sara's life at age 13 to Sara's husband. After talking to Marion's sister and mother about the abuse suffered by Marion at the hands of her father, Cassie follows Marion to speak with her. She is in the back room of a pub, talking with Colin and Sara. In the next scene, Cassie then speaks with Colin alone, who tells her the details of the abuse in his childhood, at the hands of a friend of his parents. Cassie decides, and is supported by Sunny, that the three have suffered all their lives, all work in jobs of high value to society, there is no value in pursuing prison for them, and they have insufficient data for a solid court case, especially as one of the bodies was never found, and the other death is recorded as suicide. Each of the three, Colin, Sara and Marion, is shown telling the story of their past to their present spouse.\n|LineColor=FF623B\n}}\n}}\n\n===Series 3 (2018)===\n{{Episode table |background=#40E0D0 |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer=  |airdate= |viewers= |viewersR=<ref name=BARB/> |country=UK |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=13\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title= Episode 1\n |DirectedBy=[[Andy Wilson (director)|Andy Wilson]]\n |WrittenBy=[[Chris Lang]]\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2018|7|15|df=y}}\n |Viewers= 6.80\n |ShortSummary= When workmen carrying out carriageway repairs on [[M1 motorway|M1]] uncover human remains in the [[central reservation]], Cassie and the team investigate. Despite suspicions the remains could be archaeological, forensic analysis reveals the victim was a young female who could not have been buried before 1991. The only clue is a [[titanium]] [[surgical plate]] that appears foreign and has no serial number. Sunny identifies the plate as having been manufactured by a Greek Cypriot company in the mid-1990s, and working on the assumption that the victim may have broken her wrist on holiday, the team begin to trawl through hundreds of missing persons files in the hope of finding an identity. They discover Hayley Reid, a 16-year-old who disappeared on New Year's Day in 2000, and her twin sister, Jessica, confirms she broke her wrist while on holiday in Cyprus in 1995 and had a plate inserted.\n|LineColor= 40E0D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=14\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title= Episode 2\n |DirectedBy=Andy Wilson\n |WrittenBy=Chris Lang\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2018|7|22|df=y}}\n |Viewers=6.64\n |ShortSummary= Cassie and Sunny visit Hayley's family in Middenham, [[Hampshire]], and break the news that it appears Hayley was strangled. Jessica warns Cassie that reopening the investigation could potentially bring a swarm of negative press back to the town, which wiped out the town's remaining tourism trade for years after Hayley's disappearance. Cassie and Sunny meet with former DCI John Bentley, responsible for the original investigation into Hayley's disappearance, who describes his guilt for the police initially dismissing Hayley as a runaway. The police had investigated Hayley's boyfriend, Adrian Mullery, but he was never charged. After DNA confirms the remains were Hayley, one of her friends informs Cassie and Sunny that two days before her disappearance, Hayley subbed for her cleaning a holiday rental. News of the discovery reaches the four key potential suspects in the investigation. Jamie Hollis, who hosts a television quiz show, declines to speak to the police without his lawyer and panics after the police leave.\n|LineColor= 40E0D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=15\n |EpisodeNumber2=3\n |Title= Episode 3\n |DirectedBy=Andy Wilson\n |WrittenBy=Chris Lang\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2018|7|29|df=y}}\n |Viewers=6.74\n |ShortSummary=Cassie and Sunny learn from Jamie that he and three friends shared the holiday rental with their families before the New Year, and that they spent New Year's Eve at the house before returning to London on 2 January. The detectives note the friends attended school close to where Hayley was buried, and three who were married divorced shortly afterward. All four are troubled: Jamie is struggling to deal with his ex-wife and drug addict son, Eliot, who suffers from [[gender dysphoria]]; [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] artist Chris Lowe lives in a van [[off-the-grid]]; Pete Carr is a failed salesman; and GP Dr. Tim Finch was investigated for verbally abusing an elderly patient. Pete sees the circumstances as a solution to his financial problems, and surprisingly tells the police he saw Hayley cleaning the rental house; he claims he knew nothing of her disappearance as he returned to Hong Kong, where he was living at the time, shortly after. The rest of the team look at the timelines and leads from the original investigation, including a burglary at a church and a black sedan seen driving erratically. Jamie's ex-wife, Melissa, reveals the men were drinking and some using cocaine, and that after Chris had a mental breakdown, the four left before midnight. \n |LineColor= 40E0D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=16\n |EpisodeNumber2=4\n |Title= Episode 4\n |DirectedBy=Andy Wilson\n |WrittenBy=Chris Lang\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2018|8|5|df=y}}\n |Viewers=6.84\n |ShortSummary=Detectives investigate why the four men not only lied about staying in on New Year's Eve 2000, but colluded in that lie. Jamie is besieged by journalists after a blogger, Sandra Rayworth, exposes his connection to Hayley. Pete, who served time in a Hong Kong prison for defrauding a disability charity, admits to the church robbery after DNA ties him to the scene. Tim's ex-wife, Derran, says he is a controlling and abusive man. Chris's daughter says her parents' marriage and his business were destroyed because he was arrested for child porn, but police cannot find any record of this. Melissa, an author, gives an interview discussing her experience as a wife of a perpetually unfaithful man, resulting in multiple emails from women who had sexual liaisons with Jamie, who liked rape fantasies. Pete tries to blackmail Jamie, saying he \"knows things\" about Jamie's son the night of Hayley's murder.

Tim tells the police that prior to the attack, Pete told him that on New Year's Eve 2000, he saw Eliot sneaking into the house after 2&nbsp;am. Fran believes that Hayley's diary uses codewords to describe drug use and sex, and that she was looking to buy drugs for a New Year's Eve party. Chris states that despite his arrest, he was not the one who visited child porn websites, and investigators were able to prove his credit card info was stolen, leading to all charges being dropped, but his life destroyed. Jamie's former car matches the one seen driving erratically, and Melissa claims that her husband had told her he hit a deer that weekend. Jamie tells police he believed his son accidentally killed Hayley while driving drunk, her body fallen into the river and washed out to sea. After Pete's death, Sandra is arrested for inciting the vigilantism that ultimately killed him.

Tim denies involvement, but after it's revealed he was staying in Earlridge for a medical conference when Alison was abducted, he confesses to being a serial rapist and murderer of young girls. Without any remorse, Tim nonchalantly explains how he abducted, raped and strangled Hayley while coming across her by chance on New Year's Eve, and later takes them to the remains of another one of his victims. He confesses to there being many more victims but does not give their details. Chris reconciles with his fianc\u00e9e, Jamila, and Cassie visits her father, who encourages her to take time off from work.

At the end of the trail is a diary belonging to Jimmy Sullivan, a young man missing since 1976 who appears to be the victim. The final pages of the diary contain several names and addresses; amongst them are Beth, Father Rob, Frankie C and Mr. Slater. Four seemingly unconnected people living very separate lives.

She is met by a woman who is in fact relieved that she might finally find out what happened to her son 39 years after he went missing. 'Frankie C' is identified as Sir Phillip Cross, the government's recently appointed entrepreneurial tzar, who denies ever having met Jimmy. 'Beth' is identified as Lizzie Wilton, living in Croydon and married to Ray, a second-generation Jamaican man. Lizzie also denies knowing Jimmy but is clearly a very different woman from who she was in the 70s before her marriage. 'Father Rob' is Robert Greaves who at the time of Jimmy's death was working in the local church to Arlingham House. And 'Mr. Slater' is Eric Slater, a wheelchair user and a retired bookkeeper living with his wife Claire in Cambridgeshire.\n|LineColor=000080\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=3\n |EpisodeNumber2=3\n |Title=Episode 3\n |DirectedBy=Andy Wilson\n |WrittenBy=Chris Lang\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2015|10|22|df=y}}\n |Viewers=6.29\n |ShortSummary= The investigation into Jimmy's death continues.

Did the businessman or any of the shady associates of his youth have anything to do with Jimmy's disappearance or murder? Meanwhile, Eric and Claire's anniversary gets under way.

Father Robert confesses that he was the one who stole money from the church charity fund, and that after his secret affair with JoJo, she became pregnant and he has been using the money to pay the way for his illegitimate child. Before the news breaks of Eric Slater's arrest, Sir Phillip Cross has already struck a deal with his son's Turkish contacts and before he is able to change his mind, the witness who came forward with evidence against him is killed in a house fire, made to look like an accident caused when the man 'fell asleep smoking'. Evidence found in Eric Slater's home links him to the location of the last known whereabouts of the second victim, and following the revelation that Jimmy had been selling himself for sex as a way of repaying the debt he owed to the Fenwicks, Cassie and Sunny finally realise that the connection between both murders may be Eric Slater's hidden hatred for homosexuals.\n|LineColor=000080\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=6\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title=Episode 6\n |DirectedBy=Andy Wilson\n |WrittenBy=Chris Lang\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2015|11|12|df=y}}\n |Viewers=6.01\n |ShortSummary= Father Robert's revelations prove to have lasting repercussions, especially for Caroline when she goes into premature labour.

One message appears to be an address in King's Cross, which is soon discovered to have been a brothel at the time of Walker's death. Cassie and Sunny interrogate Sara Mahmoud, who was known to have been working as a prostitute from the address at the time \u2013 but she denies even knowing Walker, and claims that she was on holiday in Italy at the time of the murder. A telephone number in the victim's diary leads Cassie and Sunny to Colin Osborne, who also denies ever having known Walker. Osborne, meanwhile, continues to feel the pressure from Tyler. Tessa Nixon's boss, Detective Superintendent Gill (Nathalie Armin), asks her to take restricted duties while the investigation takes its course, which she angrily refuses to do as she has not been named as a suspect in her husband's death.

Sunny interviews Walker's best friend, James Gregory ([[Richard Hope (actor)|Richard Hope]]), who claims that in the days leading up to his death, Walker confronted the abuser, who denied being involved in any such abuse. Cassie visits the address found on the back of Walker's business card, and interviews Marion's mother and sister, Joy and Elise, who claim at the time of Walker's death, Marion was the only one living at the house and could be the only person to have given out the address. Checks on Marion's criminal history reveal she was arrested in 1988 for assaulting a police officer during a protest march, and that she was living at an address with a known IRA conspirator.

Meanwhile, Cassie discovers that Colin was sacked from his City job in 1989 for reportedly sexually assaulting one of his female colleagues during an office party, a fact which leads her to believe that Colin was framed for the attack. Meanwhile, Marion is suspended from work after Zoe absconds from her parents' care. As the investigation into Walker's past continues, Sunny discovers that he was heavily into S&M, and sexually attacked at least one woman whom he slept with. Concerns that his private fantasies may have spilt over into his charity work are confirmed when Ellen Price, a resident at one of the care homes where Walker volunteered, comes forward to tell the police that Walker interfered with her and other children at the home.

Colin is shocked to discover that the rape allegation made against him was concocted by David Walker, who paid the supposed victim \u00a35,000 to fake the story. Ellen Price revisits the location where Walker and his friends used to hold 'parties' where children were abused. Tessa's denial of David's activities is called into question when Ellen recalls David's wife having turned up at one of the parties, which forced a row in front of many of the guests. As Marion's home life continues to spiral, she tries to make things up with Zoe. Simon makes the heartbreaking decision to cease the adoption unless Colin can convince Tyler to back off. Sara's husband uncovers evidence which confirms she was in Naples at the time of the murder.

Though Sara has provided reliable evidence that she was in Italy when the murder took place, Cassie suspects that it is too good \u2013 that it is something put together by someone who knew that one day they would need an alibi. The team wonder whether the case is part of a wider revenge plan. On that new line of investigation, the team find that Sara and Colin had been in the same psychiatric hospital at the same time, and could have met then. The team's notion is that each one killed the abuser of another, not their own abuser. While Sara denies every possibility put to her by Cassie, the scenes are cut with Sara's father telling an opposite scenario of Sara's life at age 13 to Sara's husband. After talking to Marion's sister and mother about the abuse suffered by Marion at the hands of her father, Cassie follows Marion to speak with her. She is in the back room of a pub, talking with Colin and Sara. In the next scene, Cassie then speaks with Colin alone, who tells her the details of the abuse in his childhood, at the hands of a friend of his parents. Cassie decides, and is supported by Sunny, that the three have suffered all their lives, all work in jobs of high value to society, there is no value in pursuing prison for them, and they have insufficient data for a solid court case, especially as one of the bodies was never found, and the other death is recorded as suicide. Each of the three, Colin, Sara and Marion, is shown telling the story of their past to their present spouse.\n|LineColor=FF623B\n}}\n}}\n\n===Series 3 (2018)===\n{{Episode table |background=#40E0D0 |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer=  |airdate= |viewers= |viewersR=<ref name=BARB/> |country=UK |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=13\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title= Episode 1\n |DirectedBy=[[Andy Wilson (director)|Andy Wilson]]\n |WrittenBy=[[Chris Lang]]\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2018|7|15|df=y}}\n |Viewers= 6.80\n |ShortSummary= When workmen carrying out carriageway repairs on [[M1 motorway|M1]] uncover human remains in the [[central reservation]], Cassie and the team investigate.

The only clue is a [[titanium]] [[surgical plate]] that appears foreign and has no serial number. Sunny identifies the plate as having been manufactured by a Greek Cypriot company in the mid-1990s, and working on the assumption that the victim may have broken her wrist on holiday, the team begin to trawl through hundreds of missing persons files in the hope of finding an identity.

Cassie and Sunny meet with former DCI John Bentley, responsible for the original investigation into Hayley's disappearance, who describes his guilt for the police initially dismissing Hayley as a runaway. The police had investigated Hayley's boyfriend, Adrian Mullery, but he was never charged. After DNA confirms the remains were Hayley, one of her friends informs Cassie and Sunny that two days before her disappearance, Hayley subbed for her cleaning a holiday rental.

All four are troubled: Jamie is struggling to deal with his ex-wife and drug addict son, Eliot, who suffers from [[gender dysphoria]]; [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] artist Chris Lowe lives in a van [[off-the-grid]]; Pete Carr is a failed salesman; and GP Dr. Tim Finch was investigated for verbally abusing an elderly patient. Pete sees the circumstances as a solution to his financial problems, and surprisingly tells the police he saw Hayley cleaning the rental house; he claims he knew nothing of her disappearance as he returned to Hong Kong, where he was living at the time, shortly after. The rest of the team look at the timelines and leads from the original investigation, including a burglary at a church and a black sedan seen driving erratically.

Jamie is besieged by journalists after a blogger, Sandra Rayworth, exposes his connection to Hayley. Pete, who served time in a Hong Kong prison for defrauding a disability charity, admits to the church robbery after DNA ties him to the scene. Tim's ex-wife, Derran, says he is a controlling and abusive man. Chris's daughter says her parents' marriage and his business were destroyed because he was arrested for child porn, but police cannot find any record of this. Melissa, an author, gives an interview discussing her experience as a wife of a perpetually unfaithful man, resulting in multiple emails from women who had sexual liaisons with Jamie, who liked rape fantasies. Pete tries to blackmail Jamie, saying he \"knows things\" about Jamie's son the night of Hayley's murder. Police investigate Eliot after discovering he had already been arrested several times, including for stealing his father's car. Pete is stabbed after Cassie leaves his file in a caf\u00e9 and his past is exposed. \n|LineColor= 40E0D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=17\n |EpisodeNumber2=5\n |Title= Episode 5\n |DirectedBy=Andy Wilson\n |WrittenBy=Chris Lang\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2018|8|12|df=y}}\n |Viewers=6.81\n |ShortSummary=After barely surviving the attack, Pete dies, putting Cassie's career in jeopardy. Tim tells the police that prior to the attack, Pete told him that on New Year's Eve 2000, he saw Eliot sneaking into the house after 2&nbsp;am. Fran believes that Hayley's diary uses codewords to describe drug use and sex, and that she was looking to buy drugs for a New Year's Eve party. Chris states that despite his arrest, he was not the one who visited child porn websites, and investigators were able to prove his credit card info was stolen, leading to all charges being dropped, but his life destroyed. Jamie's former car matches the one seen driving erratically, and Melissa claims that her husband had told her he hit a deer that weekend. Jamie tells police he believed his son accidentally killed Hayley while driving drunk, her body fallen into the river and washed out to sea. After Pete's death, Sandra is arrested for inciting the vigilantism that ultimately killed him. Police arrest Tim after discovering he was pulled over for speeding outside Middenham on 3 January 2000 \u2013 the day after he'd returned to London\n |LineColor= 40E0D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=18\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title= Episode 6\n |DirectedBy=Andy Wilson\n |WrittenBy=Chris Lang\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2018|8|19|df=y}}\n |Viewers=7.31\n |ShortSummary= Tim claims that the scrunchie, women's knickers and a cross necklace found in a lockbox in his cellar were purchased at a [[flea market|fete]] for his daughters, but DNA results prove they belonged to Alison Baldwin, a 14-year-old from Earlridge, [[Cambridgeshire]], found raped and strangled in 1997. Tim denies involvement, but after it's revealed he was staying in Earlridge for a medical conference when Alison was abducted, he confesses to being a serial rapist and murderer of young girls. Without any remorse, Tim nonchalantly explains how he abducted, raped and strangled Hayley while coming across her by chance on New Year's Eve, and later takes them to the remains of another one of his victims. He confesses to there being many more victims but does not give their details. Chris reconciles with his fianc\u00e9e, Jamila, and Cassie visits her father, who encourages her to take time off from work. Several months later, Cassie and Sunny bring flowers to a memorial garden for Hayley.\n|LineColor= 40E0D0\n}}\n}}\n\n=== Series 4 (2020) ===\nAfter the third series had been aired on ITV, the broadcaster announced that a fourth series had been picked up for production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/09/itv-unforgotten-fourth-season-1202468152/|title=ITV Brings Back Chris Lang-Penned Cop Drama \u2018Unforgotten\u2019 For A Fourth Season|last=White|first=Peter|last2=White|first2=Peter|date=20 September 2018|publisher=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n\u201c[Season 4] will be about our relationship with the police,\" Lang said. \"I think I if I had to describe it, I\u2019d say it's both a love letter and a ''j\u2019accuses'' {{sic}}, which again reflects that slightly conflicted relationship that I think a lot of us have with the police.
