On 30 March [[Auckland Rugby League]] held its fifteenth annual meeting with 200 in attendance. The strong financial position of the league was commented on. It was also decided that if possible the Senior Grade would be split into A and B divisions owing to the increasing number of teams who wished to enter but also the gap in standard between the best teams and the worst.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Most Successful Year/Sound Financial Position/The Election of Officers\n| page =12\n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=18981 \n| date = 1925-03-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250331.2.155\n| accessdate = 2019-09-11}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=17th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1925}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1926 Auckland Rugby League season|1926]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Trophy Winners===\n[[City Rovers]] won the First Grade Championship for the 7th time in just 15 seasons. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the 4th time in the 11 seasons it had been competed for. Ponsonby also won the Stormont Shield after defeating City in the final in its inaugural season.\n\nWhile in the B division [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won the inaugural title and were awarded the Norton Cup. At the end of the season these teams competed for their own knockout trophy which was named the Stallard Cup. It was won by [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] who defeated [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] in the final.\n\nIn the lower grades [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] dominated like they were to come to do for many seasons. They won the 2nd grade, 3rd grade, and both sections of the 6th grade. They were a very powerful club at the junior level and this would ultimately lead to great success at the senior grade level.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland team played in 5 matches with a number of other Auckland B and Auckland C team matches. They played against the New Zealand team twice and the touring Queensland side who they drew with 18 all. The Auckland side claimed the Northern Union Challenege Cup off the holders, South Auckland and they retained it against the same opponents in a later match. In addition the Auckland Provincial team played Queensland but were soundly beaten 54-14.\n\n===Death of Bill Stormont and inauguration of the Stormont Shield===\nOn June 4 [[William Stormont]] (known better as Bill Stormont) died, succumbing to rheumatic heart disease. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Deaths - Stormont\n| page = 1\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 131\n| date = 1925-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250605.2.5\n| accessdate = 2019-11-10}}</ref> Stormont had played for the [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] senior team from 1920 to 1924 scoring 24 tries and kicking 31 goals. He had also represented [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] on 16 occasions, scoring 4 tries and kicking 2 goals as well as playing 3 matches for [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] in 1920. He had been ill for quite some time and had not played for Marist since the end of the 1924 season. The funeral was on the Sunday leaving his parents residence in Epsom and progressing to Purewa Cemetery where he was buried. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Deaths-Stormont\n| page = 1\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII, Issue 19037\n| date = 1925-06-06\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250606.2.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-20}}</ref> The match between Marist and [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] on Saturday was originally postponed but was never played. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 131\n| date = 1924-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250605.2.126\n| accessdate = 2020-04-20}}</ref> The matches at [[Carlaw Park]] saw one minutes silence before kickoff.

After a series of 3 trial matches on 27 June both the New Zealand team and Auckland teams were selected. Officials had declared that \"give us fine weather and we will get an attendance of 20,000\". Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side.

It was also decided that if possible the Senior Grade would be split into A and B divisions owing to the increasing number of teams who wished to enter but also the gap in standard between the best teams and the worst.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Most Successful Year/Sound Financial Position/The Election of Officers\n| page =12\n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=18981 \n| date = 1925-03-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250331.2.155\n| accessdate = 2019-09-11}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=17th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1925}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1926 Auckland Rugby League season|1926]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Trophy Winners===\n[[City Rovers]] won the First Grade Championship for the 7th time in just 15 seasons. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the 4th time in the 11 seasons it had been competed for. Ponsonby also won the Stormont Shield after defeating City in the final in its inaugural season.\n\nWhile in the B division [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won the inaugural title and were awarded the Norton Cup. At the end of the season these teams competed for their own knockout trophy which was named the Stallard Cup. It was won by [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] who defeated [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] in the final.\n\nIn the lower grades [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] dominated like they were to come to do for many seasons. They won the 2nd grade, 3rd grade, and both sections of the 6th grade. They were a very powerful club at the junior level and this would ultimately lead to great success at the senior grade level.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland team played in 5 matches with a number of other Auckland B and Auckland C team matches. They played against the New Zealand team twice and the touring Queensland side who they drew with 18 all. The Auckland side claimed the Northern Union Challenege Cup off the holders, South Auckland and they retained it against the same opponents in a later match. In addition the Auckland Provincial team played Queensland but were soundly beaten 54-14.\n\n===Death of Bill Stormont and inauguration of the Stormont Shield===\nOn June 4 [[William Stormont]] (known better as Bill Stormont) died, succumbing to rheumatic heart disease. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Deaths - Stormont\n| page = 1\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 131\n| date = 1925-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250605.2.5\n| accessdate = 2019-11-10}}</ref> Stormont had played for the [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] senior team from 1920 to 1924 scoring 24 tries and kicking 31 goals.

He had been ill for quite some time and had not played for Marist since the end of the 1924 season. The funeral was on the Sunday leaving his parents residence in Epsom and progressing to Purewa Cemetery where he was buried. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Deaths-Stormont\n| page = 1\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII, Issue 19037\n| date = 1925-06-06\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250606.2.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-20}}</ref> The match between Marist and [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] on Saturday was originally postponed but was never played. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 131\n| date = 1924-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250605.2.126\n| accessdate = 2020-04-20}}</ref> The matches at [[Carlaw Park]] saw one minutes silence before kickoff.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16.

After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches.

Maimoona's brother Baseerat Hussain ([[Behroze Sabzwari]]) is wealthy and married to Farida ([[Atiqa Odho]]); they have a son named Ashar ([[Fawad Khan]]). After the doctors inform  Maimoona that she is in the last stage of cancer & that she will die soon, Maimoona seeks her brother's help in arranging Khirad's marriage. Feeling guilty for not taking better care of Maimoona, Baseerat compensates by promising that Ashar will marry Khirad, unbeknownst to both Ashar & Farida. This irks Farida, who has always wanted Ashar to marry his cousin Sara ([[Naveen Waqar]]), the daughter of Farida's sister Zarina Ajmal ([[Hina Khawaja Bayat]]). Khirad is the last to find out about the engagement & begs her mother not go through with it, as she does not know Ashar nor does she love him. In spite of their reluctance, Ashar and Khirad are married moments before Maimoona passes away. Sara, who is in love with Ashar, is heartbroken upon learning this and attempts suicide. Both Ashar and Khirad are standoffish towards each other and feel uncomfortable in the forced marriage. Ashar still promises Khirad that he will attempt to maintain a stable & civil relationship. Khirad feels that by marrying a man who is financially superior, she has lost her self-respect. With the encouragement of Sara, Ashar avoids going home by staying out late with friends. After overhearing Khirad vent her fustrastions about the marriage arrangement to Baseerat, Ashar becomes more considerate towards Khirad's feelings & needs. Gradually, the duo fall deeply in love with each other. Ashar admires Khirad's innocence, simplicity and purity of heart; his admiration is reciprocated by Khirad, who is in awe of his caring personality. While he develops a strong and loving relationship with his wife, Ashar remains friends with Sara. Noticing Ashar's bond with Khirad is getting stronger, Sara attempts to interfere in their relationship. When Sara humiliates Khirad at a party, Ashar reprimands her for her callousness. Farida pretends to desire a mother-daughter bond with Khirad and displays false affection for her after Baseerat threatens her with divorce. Soon, Baseerat falls ill and on his death-bed, he reminds his son that it is important for him to always protect and love Khirad.\n\nEncouraged by Ashar, Khirad enrolls in university for graduate studies. She meets Khizar, Sara's paternal cousin, who has strong feelings for Sara. In order to win her affection, he agrees to a conspiracy hatched by Farida. To create misunderstandings between Khirad and Ashar, he begins to visit their house, while praising and flirting with Khirad; this makes Ashar increasingly jealous. Farida offers Khizar a deal; to receive money and Sara's hand in marriage, he must convince Ashar that he is having an affair with Khirad. In the meantime, Khirad discovers that she is pregnant with Ashar's child and plans to surprise him. After finding out about Khirad's pregnancy, Farida invites Khirad to a dinner at a family friend's house. However unbeknownst to Khirad the house is actually Khizar's. Farida successfully causes Ashar to witness what appears to be Khizar and Khirad's intimacy. Farida pretends to be outraged at Khirad's supposed adultery, and insults her while Ashar listens tearfully. Khirad protests and calls Khizar, who continuously insists that they are having an affair. After Farida, Zarina & Ashar leave, Khizar explains to Khirad why he lied. Hurt and enraged Ashar drives around & strolls the beach all night. Leaving no chance for Ashar to speak to her, Farida exiles Khirad from the house. Before taking refuge with her mother's old friend Batool Bano in Hyderabad, Khirad leaves a note for Ashar in which she proclaims her innocence, Fareeda's set up & reveals her pregnancy. Jamaal, the house servant, gives Ashar the letter but he never reads it. Khirad desperately attempts to contact Ashar, however he refuses to listen to her. A few months later, Khirad goes into premature labour while attempting to contact Ashar one last time, who ignores her phone call. Khirad gives birth to a baby girl and names her Hareem; she vows that she will never forgive Ashar for what he did to her.\n\nFour years later, Khirad reluctantly returns to Karachi, where she visits Ashar to seek financial assistance for Hareem, who needs open heart surgery. He initially refuses to help and fails to believe that Hareem is his daughter, but relents after he sees Hareem. Ashar begins making arrangements for Hareem to see a specialist and dictates to Khirad that they will live with him, while Farida is out of town. During Khirad's stay Ashar displays an attitude of disdain for her but spoils Harreem. When Sara discovers that Khirad has returned, she confronts Ashar and informs Farida, who returns early from a trip to America and threatens to exile Khirad once again. In retaliation, Khirad threatens to tell Ashar the truth about her being framed. After Sara confesses her love, Ashar informs Sara that he has never loved her and suggests that she should stop pursuing him. Khizar arrives from America and blackmails Farida by threatening to reveal Khirad's innocence if Sara does not marry him. Farida urges Sara to marry Khizar, but Sara and her mother Zarina refuse and blames Farida for ruining Sara's life. Meanwhile, Hareem's operation is successful and Ashar finds that his feelings for Khirad have rekindled.\n\nZarina is disturbed by Sara's everlasting depression, which stems from Ashar's rejection and Fareeda's betrayal. Ashar attempts to reconcile with Khirad, citing love of their daughter, but she rejects him and decides to leave Hareem in his care. Having realized that Sara will never marry him, Khizar visits Ashar to reveal the truth but an angered Ashar has him escorted out by security. The incident sparks the memories of Ashar's past with his wife and in his sorrow, he accidentally discovers the letter that Khirad left for him, which he had thrown aside. Ashar then overhears his mother's conversation with Khizar, and finally learns of their collaboration. Sara commits suicide and her mother blames Farida for her misery. With the pretense that Hareem is missing her and not eating anything, Ashar asks Khirad to return from Hyderabad who is living with her mother's old friend Batool Bano. He then confronts Farida, accusing her of destroying his life, and simultaneously blames himself for failing to trust his wife. Farida loses her sanity when she realizes what she has done to Ashar and Sara. Ashar begs for Khirad's forgiveness and asks her to return to his life; she finally forgives him and they reconcile. Three months later, the two are shown to be living a happy life with their daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fawad Khan]] as Ashar Hussainn\n* [[Mahira Khan]] as Khirad Ashar Hussain \n* [[Naveen Waqar]] as Sara Ajmal\n* [[Atiqa Odho]] as Farida Hussain\n* [[Behroze Sabzwari]] as Baseerat Hussain\n* Sara Kashif as Hareem Hussain (child)\n* [[Hina Khawaja Bayat]] as Zarina Ajmal\n* [[Noor Hassan Rizvi]] as Khizar \n* Saba Faisal as Maimoona Ahsaan\n*[[Shahbaz Wolf Rajput]] as Ali\n* Qaiser Naqvi as Batool Bano\n\n===Guest Appearances===\n* [[Khalid Anam]] as Khirad's father\n* [[Mansha Pasha]] as the wife of Ashar's friend\n* [[Kanwar Arsalan]] as Raza, Ashar's colleague\n* [[Kanwar Atiq ur Rehman]] as Umar, Ashar's colleague\n* [[Sarmad Khoosat]] as Dr. Idrees, Khirad's Professor\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = [[Woh Humsafar Tha]]\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Qurat-ul-Ain Balouch]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   =\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Theme song]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=39|s=47}}\n| language   = [[Urdu language|Urdu]]\n| label      =\n| producer   = [[Momina Duraid]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe show's theme song ''Woh Humsafar Tha'' was composed by [[Waqar Ali]] and sung by [[Qurat-ul-Ain Balouch]].

Maimoona's brother Baseerat Hussain ([[Behroze Sabzwari]]) is wealthy and married to Farida ([[Atiqa Odho]]); they have a son named Ashar ([[Fawad Khan]]). After the doctors inform  Maimoona that she is in the last stage of cancer & that she will die soon, Maimoona seeks her brother's help in arranging Khirad's marriage. Feeling guilty for not taking better care of Maimoona, Baseerat compensates by promising that Ashar will marry Khirad, unbeknownst to both Ashar & Farida. This irks Farida, who has always wanted Ashar to marry his cousin Sara ([[Naveen Waqar]]), the daughter of Farida's sister Zarina Ajmal ([[Hina Khawaja Bayat]]). Khirad is the last to find out about the engagement & begs her mother not go through with it, as she does not know Ashar nor does she love him. In spite of their reluctance, Ashar and Khirad are married moments before Maimoona passes away. Sara, who is in love with Ashar, is heartbroken upon learning this and attempts suicide. Both Ashar and Khirad are standoffish towards each other and feel uncomfortable in the forced marriage. Ashar still promises Khirad that he will attempt to maintain a stable & civil relationship. Khirad feels that by marrying a man who is financially superior, she has lost her self-respect. With the encouragement of Sara, Ashar avoids going home by staying out late with friends. After overhearing Khirad vent her fustrastions about the marriage arrangement to Baseerat, Ashar becomes more considerate towards Khirad's feelings & needs. Gradually, the duo fall deeply in love with each other. Ashar admires Khirad's innocence, simplicity and purity of heart; his admiration is reciprocated by Khirad, who is in awe of his caring personality. While he develops a strong and loving relationship with his wife, Ashar remains friends with Sara. Noticing Ashar's bond with Khirad is getting stronger, Sara attempts to interfere in their relationship. When Sara humiliates Khirad at a party, Ashar reprimands her for her callousness. Farida pretends to desire a mother-daughter bond with Khirad and displays false affection for her after Baseerat threatens her with divorce. Soon, Baseerat falls ill and on his death-bed, he reminds his son that it is important for him to always protect and love Khirad.\n\nEncouraged by Ashar, Khirad enrolls in university for graduate studies. She meets Khizar, Sara's paternal cousin, who has strong feelings for Sara. In order to win her affection, he agrees to a conspiracy hatched by Farida. To create misunderstandings between Khirad and Ashar, he begins to visit their house, while praising and flirting with Khirad; this makes Ashar increasingly jealous. Farida offers Khizar a deal; to receive money and Sara's hand in marriage, he must convince Ashar that he is having an affair with Khirad. In the meantime, Khirad discovers that she is pregnant with Ashar's child and plans to surprise him. After finding out about Khirad's pregnancy, Farida invites Khirad to a dinner at a family friend's house. However unbeknownst to Khirad the house is actually Khizar's. Farida successfully causes Ashar to witness what appears to be Khizar and Khirad's intimacy. Farida pretends to be outraged at Khirad's supposed adultery, and insults her while Ashar listens tearfully. Khirad protests and calls Khizar, who continuously insists that they are having an affair. After Farida, Zarina & Ashar leave, Khizar explains to Khirad why he lied. Hurt and enraged Ashar drives around & strolls the beach all night. Leaving no chance for Ashar to speak to her, Farida exiles Khirad from the house. Before taking refuge with her mother's old friend Batool Bano in Hyderabad, Khirad leaves a note for Ashar in which she proclaims her innocence, Fareeda's set up & reveals her pregnancy. Jamaal, the house servant, gives Ashar the letter but he never reads it. Khirad desperately attempts to contact Ashar, however he refuses to listen to her. A few months later, Khirad goes into premature labour while attempting to contact Ashar one last time, who ignores her phone call. Khirad gives birth to a baby girl and names her Hareem; she vows that she will never forgive Ashar for what he did to her.\n\nFour years later, Khirad reluctantly returns to Karachi, where she visits Ashar to seek financial assistance for Hareem, who needs open heart surgery. He initially refuses to help and fails to believe that Hareem is his daughter, but relents after he sees Hareem. Ashar begins making arrangements for Hareem to see a specialist and dictates to Khirad that they will live with him, while Farida is out of town. During Khirad's stay Ashar displays an attitude of disdain for her but spoils Harreem. When Sara discovers that Khirad has returned, she confronts Ashar and informs Farida, who returns early from a trip to America and threatens to exile Khirad once again. In retaliation, Khirad threatens to tell Ashar the truth about her being framed. After Sara confesses her love, Ashar informs Sara that he has never loved her and suggests that she should stop pursuing him. Khizar arrives from America and blackmails Farida by threatening to reveal Khirad's innocence if Sara does not marry him. Farida urges Sara to marry Khizar, but Sara and her mother Zarina refuse and blames Farida for ruining Sara's life. Meanwhile, Hareem's operation is successful and Ashar finds that his feelings for Khirad have rekindled.\n\nZarina is disturbed by Sara's everlasting depression, which stems from Ashar's rejection and Fareeda's betrayal. Ashar attempts to reconcile with Khirad, citing love of their daughter, but she rejects him and decides to leave Hareem in his care. Having realized that Sara will never marry him, Khizar visits Ashar to reveal the truth but an angered Ashar has him escorted out by security. The incident sparks the memories of Ashar's past with his wife and in his sorrow, he accidentally discovers the letter that Khirad left for him, which he had thrown aside. Ashar then overhears his mother's conversation with Khizar, and finally learns of their collaboration. Sara commits suicide and her mother blames Farida for her misery. With the pretense that Hareem is missing her and not eating anything, Ashar asks Khirad to return from Hyderabad who is living with her mother's old friend Batool Bano. He then confronts Farida, accusing her of destroying his life, and simultaneously blames himself for failing to trust his wife. Farida loses her sanity when she realizes what she has done to Ashar and Sara. Ashar begs for Khirad's forgiveness and asks her to return to his life; she finally forgives him and they reconcile. Three months later, the two are shown to be living a happy life with their daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fawad Khan]] as Ashar Hussainn\n* [[Mahira Khan]] as Khirad Ashar Hussain \n* [[Naveen Waqar]] as Sara Ajmal\n* [[Atiqa Odho]] as Farida Hussain\n* [[Behroze Sabzwari]] as Baseerat Hussain\n* Sara Kashif as Hareem Hussain (child)\n* [[Hina Khawaja Bayat]] as Zarina Ajmal\n* [[Noor Hassan Rizvi]] as Khizar \n* Saba Faisal as Maimoona Ahsaan\n*[[Shahbaz Wolf Rajput]] as Ali\n* Qaiser Naqvi as Batool Bano\n\n===Guest Appearances===\n* [[Khalid Anam]] as Khirad's father\n* [[Mansha Pasha]] as the wife of Ashar's friend\n* [[Kanwar Arsalan]] as Raza, Ashar's colleague\n* [[Kanwar Atiq ur Rehman]] as Umar, Ashar's colleague\n* [[Sarmad Khoosat]] as Dr. Idrees, Khirad's Professor\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = [[Woh Humsafar Tha]]\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Qurat-ul-Ain Balouch]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   =\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Theme song]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=39|s=47}}\n| language   = [[Urdu language|Urdu]]\n| label      =\n| producer   = [[Momina Duraid]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe show's theme song ''Woh Humsafar Tha'' was composed by [[Waqar Ali]] and sung by [[Qurat-ul-Ain Balouch]].

He began to attend the French Dominican [[Coll\u00e8ge des Fr\u00e8res de Jaffa]] in 1936.\n\nHis first appointment was as a registrar of cooperative societies (1942) under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government in [[Jerusalem]], which appointed him in 1945 the district governor of [[Galilee]]. Subsequent to the partition plan of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and the creation of the independent [[Jewish]] state of [[Israel]] in 1948, al-Faruqi at first emigrated to [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], where he studied at the [[American University of Beirut]], then enrolled the next year at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]]'s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, obtaining his M.A. in [[philosophy]] in 1949. He was then accepted for entry into [[Harvard University]]'s department of philosophy and was awarded his second M.A. in philosophy there in March 1951, with a thesis entitled ''Justifying the Good: [[Metaphysics]] and [[Epistemology]] of Value'' (1952).  \n\nHis dissertation was deeply influenced by the phenomenology of [[Max Scheler]] (1874\u20131928), particularly the latter's notion of [[axiological intuitionism]]. Al-Faruqi argued that Scheler's axiological intuitionism privileged feeling as knowing, thus recognizing the logic of the heart as an ''a priori'' emotional intuition of value. Such recognition could justify carving out a conceptual as well as practical space for the emergence of a critique of post-Enlightenment Reason from the standpoint of a non-Western philosopher. However, he decided to return to Indiana University; he submitted his thesis to the Department of Philosophy and received his PhD in September 1952. By then he had a background in classical philosophy and the developing thought of the western tradition. At the beginning of 1953, he and his wife were in [[Syria]]. He then moved to [[Egypt]], where he studied at Al-Azhar University (1954\u20131958) again with a view to acquiring another PhD.\n\nIn 1958, al-Faruqi was offered a position as a visiting fellow at the Faculty of Divinity at [[McGill University]] in [[Canada]]. During his two-year tenure at McGill, he studied Christian theology and Judaism, and became acquainted with the famous Pakistani Muslim philosopher [[Fazlur Rahman]]. During these years, al-Faruqi was preoccupied with his anti-Zionist Arab identity. Rahman reminisced in 1986 that al-Faruqi's blunt anti-Zionism and his refusal to play the detached scholar \"frightened\" his McGill colleagues. Although he was soft-spoken with unfailing smiles, at McGill he was considered to be, in Rahman's words, \"an angry young Muslim Palestinian\". In order to challenge al-Faruqi's Arabocentric views of Islam, and to broaden his scope of understanding the [[ummah]], in 1961, Rahman arranged a two-year appointment for him in Pakistan at the Central Institute of Islamic Research. Rahman intended to expose al-Faruqi to the cultural diversity of Muslims and their contributions to Islam. \"Except\", Rahman (1986) later recalled, \"it was his Arabism which drew a great deal of fire both inside and outside the Institute, as well as his academic preference for Cairo\".\n\n==From Arabism to Islamism==\n\nIn 1963, after returning to the United States, he was hired as a visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago|University of Chicago's]] [[University of Chicago Divinity School|Divinity School]]. Between 1964 and 1968, al-Faruqi established himself as an associate professor at the Department of Religion at [[Syracuse University]], where he initiated its programme in Islamic Studies. In 1968, he accepted a position at [[Temple University]] as a professor of religion, where he also founded the Islamic Studies Programme. He held that position until his death in 1986.\n\nMuch of al-Faruqi's early thought is associated with what he called ''urubah'' (Arabism). In his 1962 book, ''On Arabism: Urubah and Religion'', he argued that urubah comprises the core identity and set of values which embrace all Muslims, a single community of believers ([[ummah]]). Al-Faruqi formulated the notion of ''urubah'' in contradistinction to two other hegemonic ideologies: [[Arab nationalism]] and non-Arab [[Islamic revivalism]]. Adopting an overtly essentialist position, he argued that more than merely the language of the [[Qur'an]], Arabic provided the only possible linguistic structure within which the Islamic conception of the world could be apprehended. Therefore, he asserted that ''urubah'' captured the core of Muslim consciousness, its values and faith \u2013 it was inseparable from the identity of all Muslims (al-Faruqi, 1962: 2\u201330).\n\nHe also maintained that ''urubah'' was the only context within which the non-Muslim Arabs countries could integrate into their larger societies. Even non-Muslim Arabs, according to al-Faruqi, could identify with ''urubah'' expressed in the Qur'an. In effect, ''urubah'' left non-Muslim Arabs and non-Arab Muslims at the mercy of combined linguistic and religious essentialisms. Any other form of consciousness and identity was a distortion created by colonial penetration (al-Faruqi, 1962: 211).\n\nThough few would question Arab influence on non-Arab Muslim faith and culture or Arab Muslim influence on non-Muslim Arabs, the implication that they both find their ultimate expression and fulfilment in al-Faruqi's interpretation of Arabism might be regarded by some as an attempt to establish the hegemony of Arab Islam or, more precisely, Arab Muslim culture. Both Arab nationalists and non-Arab Muslim intellectuals shunned al-Faruqi's agenda to bring non-Arab Muslims and non-Muslim Arabs together through ''urubah''. While many Muslim intellectuals such as Fazlur Rahman agreed with al-Faruqi's assertion that the Qur'an could not achieve the same eloquence and expressiveness in any other languages except Arabic, they were critical of al-Faruqi's blatant Arab chauvinism. Al-Faruqi's sojourn in Pakistan did little to alter his doctrine of ''urubah''.\n\nIt was in the United States several years later that he began to question the foundations of his earlier position. In 1968, for the first time he encountered members of the Muslim Students' Association (MSA) at Temple University. The convergence of Muslim students from diverse cultural backgrounds dramatically swayed his perception of Arab versus Islamic identity. In the spring of 1968, while a patient at the Johns Hopkins Ophthalmology Centre, al-Faruqi confided in one of the active members of the MSA, Ilyas Ba-Yunus, \"Until a few months ago, I was a Palestinian, an Arab, and a Muslim. Now I am a Muslim who happens to be an Arab from Palestine\" (Ba-Yunus, 1988: 14).\n\n==Scholarly Achievements==\n[[Image:Faruqi signature.png|thumb|right|Al-Faruqi's signature]]\n\nAl-Faruqi's early emphasis was on [[Arabism]] as the vehicle of [[Islam]] and Muslim identity. He was also one of those who proposed the idea of [[Islamization of knowledge]] and founded the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) together with [[Taha Jabir Alalwani]], [[Abdul Hamid AbuSulayman]], former Rector of [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] (IIUM), and [[Anwar Ibrahim]], in 1980.\n\nDuring his years as a visiting professor of Islamic studies and scholar-in-residence at [[McGill University]], a professor of Islamic studies at [[Karachi]]'s Central Institute of Islamic Research as well as a visiting professor at various universities in Northern America, he wrote over 100 articles for various scholarly journals and magazines in addition to 25 books, of the most notable being ''Christian Ethics: A Historical and Systematic Analysis of Its Dominant Ideas''. He also established the Islamic Studies Group of the [[American Academy of Religion]] and chaired it for ten years. He served as the vice-president of the Inter-Religious Peace Colloqium, The Muslim-Jewish-Christian Conference and as the president of the [[American Islamic College]] in [[Chicago]].\n\nAl-Faruqi viewed the existence of [[Israel]] as an affront towards [[Judaism]] due to its state ideology of [[Religious anti-Zionism#In Islam|Zionism]]. He said that the injustice caused by Zionism is such as to necessitate war. He proposed a resolution in which Israel is dismantled and its institutions de-Zionised, and that former Israeli Jews who have renounced Zionism would live as an \"ummatic community\" and move freely throughout the Muslim world:{{quote|[Islam] requires the Jews to set up their own rabbinic courts and put its whole executive power at its disposal. The ''shari'ah'', the law of Islam, demands of all Jews to submit themselves to the precepts of Jewish law as interpreted by the rabbinic courts, and treats defiance or contempt of the rabbinic court as rebellion against the Islamic state itself, on a par with like action on the part of a Muslim vis-\u00e0-vis the Islamic court.\"<ref>Ismail R. al-Faruqi, \"Islam and Zionism,\" in John L.

He spent several years at [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], then taught at several universities in North America, including [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]]. He was Professor of Religion at [[Temple University]], where he founded and chaired the [[Islamic Studies]] program. Al-Faruqi was also the founder of the [[International Institute of Islamic Thought]]. He wrote over 100 articles for various scholarly journals and magazines in addition to 25 books, of the most notable being ''Christian Ethics: A Historical and Systematic Analysis of Its Dominant Ideas''.

He served as the vice-president of the Inter-Religious Peace Colloquium, The Muslim-Jewish-Christian Conference and as the president of the [[American Islamic College]] in [[Chicago]].\n\nAl-Faruqi and his wife, [[Lois Lamya al-Faruqi]], were stabbed to death in their home in [[Wyncote, Pennsylvania|Wyncote]], [[Pennsylvania]] on May 27, 1986.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAl-Faruqi was born in [[Jaffa]], in British-mandate [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (now part of [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]])<ref>https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/135000404/ismail-raji-al_faruqi</ref>. His father, 'Abd al-Huda al-Faruqi, was an Islamic judge (''[[qadi]]'') and a religious man well-versed in Islamic scholarship. Faruqi received his religious education at home from his father and in the local mosque. He began to attend the French Dominican [[Coll\u00e8ge des Fr\u00e8res de Jaffa]] in 1936.\n\nHis first appointment was as a registrar of cooperative societies (1942) under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government in [[Jerusalem]], which appointed him in 1945 the district governor of [[Galilee]].
