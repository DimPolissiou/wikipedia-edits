In 1964, Torn appeared as Eddie Sanderson in the episode \"The Secret in the Stone\" in ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' and in the premiere of ''[[The Reporter (TV series)|The Reporter]]''.\n\nIn 1965, in the film ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]'', he played Slade, a corrupt New Orleans millionaire, who pressures [[Steve McQueen]] during a high-stakes poker game. On television that year, Torn portrayed Colonel Royce in the episode \"The Lorelei\" of ''[[Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)|Twelve O'Clock High]]''. Following these roles, he had turns as a character actor in numerous subsequent films. The part of George Hanson in ''[[Easy Rider]]'' was written for Torn by [[Terry Southern]], but according to Southern's biographer Lee Hill, Torn withdrew from the project after  co-director [[Dennis Hopper]] and he got into a bitter argument in a New York restaurant. [[Jack Nicholson]] played Hanson, instead, in a career-launching performance.\n\nIn 1972, Torn won rave reviews for his portrayal of a [[Country music|country and western]] singer in the [[cult film]] ''[[Payday (1972 film)|Payday]]''.

The screenplay was written by [[Terry Southern]] and [[Harry Nilsson]], and the film was produced by their company, Hawkeye. The story, which concerned an unhinged, out-of-work actor, had been written with [[Robin Williams]] in mind. After he turned it down, [[Whoopi Goldberg]] expressed a strong interest, but when production began, Torn reportedly had to contend with Goldberg constantly digressing and improvising, and he had to plead with her to perform takes that stuck to the script.\n\nGoldberg was backed by the studio, which also allowed her to replace Torn's chosen DP, veteran cinematographer [[John A. Alonzo]], with her then-husband. As a result of the power struggle, Torn, Southern, and Nilsson cut their own version of the film, using the takes that adhered to the script and this was screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], but the studio put together a rival version using other takes and it was poorly reviewed when it premiered in January 1988.<ref name=\"lehi\">{{Cite book |first=Lee |last=Hill |title=A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2001}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, he portrayed Colonel Fargo in ''[[By Dawn's Early Light]]'', a film from [[HBO]] about a fictional world war.

He also had an uncredited role in ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' as Barry Mills. In 1957, Torn portrayed Jody in an early episode of ''[[The Restless Gun]]''. In 1957, he starred as incarcerated Steve Morgan in the ''[[List of Alfred Hitchcock Presents episodes|Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' episode \"Number Twenty-Two\", and on the same series in 1961, he played a recently released prisoner, Ernie Walters, in the ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' episode \"The Kiss-Off\".<ref>full episode available at hulu.com</ref> After portraying [[Judas]], betrayer of Jesus, in 1961 epic film ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'', Torn appeared as a graduate student with multiple degrees in 1963 television series ''[[Channing (TV series)|Channing]]'', and as Roy Kendall in the ''[[Breaking Point (1963 TV series)|Breaking Point]]'' episode \"Millions of Faces\". In 1964, Torn appeared as Eddie Sanderson in the episode \"The Secret in the Stone\" in ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' and in the premiere of ''[[The Reporter (TV series)|The Reporter]]''.\n\nIn 1965, in the film ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]'', he played Slade, a corrupt New Orleans millionaire, who pressures [[Steve McQueen]] during a high-stakes poker game.

Following these roles, he had turns as a character actor in numerous subsequent films. The part of George Hanson in ''[[Easy Rider]]'' was written for Torn by [[Terry Southern]], but according to Southern's biographer Lee Hill, Torn withdrew from the project after  co-director [[Dennis Hopper]] and he got into a bitter argument in a New York restaurant. [[Jack Nicholson]] played Hanson, instead, in a career-launching performance.\n\nIn 1972, Torn won rave reviews for his portrayal of a [[Country music|country and western]] singer in the [[cult film]] ''[[Payday (1972 film)|Payday]]''.

The screenplay was written by [[Terry Southern]] and [[Harry Nilsson]], and the film was produced by their company, Hawkeye. The story, which concerned an unhinged, out-of-work actor, had been written with [[Robin Williams]] in mind. After he turned it down, [[Whoopi Goldberg]] expressed a strong interest, but when production began, Torn reportedly had to contend with Goldberg constantly digressing and improvising, and he had to plead with her to perform takes that stuck to the script.\n\nGoldberg was backed by the studio, which also allowed her to replace Torn's chosen DP, veteran cinematographer [[John A. Alonzo]], with her then-husband. As a result of the power struggle, Torn, Southern, and Nilsson cut their own version of the film, using the takes that adhered to the script and this was screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], but the studio put together a rival version using other takes and it was poorly reviewed when it premiered in January 1988.<ref name=\"lehi\">{{Cite book |first=Lee |last=Hill |title=A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2001}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, he portrayed Colonel Fargo in ''[[By Dawn's Early Light]]'', a film from [[HBO]] about a fictional world war.

He was known as the greatest Sultan in Ternatan and Malukan history, who defeated the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] occupants in Ternate and led the Sultanate to a golden peak at the end of the 16th century. Sultan Babullah was commonly known as the ruler of 72 inhabited islands in eastern Indonesia, including most of the [[Maluku Islands]], [[Sangihe Islands|Sangihe]] and parts of [[Sulawesi]], with influences as far as [[Solor]], [[Bima|East Sumbawa]], [[Mindanao]], and the [[Raja Ampat|Papuan Islands]].<ref>Robert Cribb (2000) ''Historical atlas of Indonesia''.

Tiele IV:1, p. 399-400.</ref> A Ternatan-Portuguese conflict broke out in the 1560s, since Muslims in [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] appealed for assistance from the sultan against the Europeans, who at this time were bent on Christianizing the island. Sultan Hairun sent a war fleet under Prince Baab who appeared before the Christian village Nusaniwi in 1563 and demanded its surrender. However, the siege had to be lifted as three Portuguese ships appeared.<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:1, p. 405.</ref> For a time after 1564, the Portuguese were forced to leave Ambon altogether, although they came back and established a stronghold in 1569.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1974), p. 12.</ref> Moreover, Baab undertook an expedition to the northern parts of Sulawesi in 1563 in order to bring these lands under his father's realm. The Portuguese authorities in Maluku understood that this would be paired with the dissemination of Islam and therefore detrimental to their position in the East Indies, and efforts were made to convert populations in [[Menado]], [[Siau Island]], Kaidipang, Toli-Toli, etc. to Christianity.<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:3, p. 418-20, IV:5, p. 440.</ref>\n\nIn spite of all these conflicts, the Ternate-Portuguese relationship was not entirely broken. The officer Gonsalo Pereira led an expedition to the [[Philippines]] in 1569, where the rulers of Tidore, Bacan and Ternate were summoned to participate. Prince Baab showed up with fifteen ''korakoras'' (large outriggers). However, since Ternate had little interest in this venture, Baab diverted on the way and brought his fleet to the [[Melaka Straits]] where he performed acts of piracy. He nevertheless lost 300 men in the enterprise. The Portuguese enterprise in the Philippines likewise turned out to be a failure, to the ill-concealed satisfaction of Hairun.<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:5, p. 438.</ref>\n\n== The death of Sultan Hairun ==\nAfter the contest for Ambon Island, Hairun strengthened his power year by year which worried the Portuguese leaders. Portuguese-influenced areas in [[Halmahera]] were attacked by his forces. Since he dominated the waterways he could stop the vital deliveries of foodstuff from Moro in Halmahera to the Portuguese settlement in Ternate.<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:4, p. 441-3.</ref> In 1570 Captain Diogo Lopes de Mesquita (1566-1570) undertook an official reconciliation with the sultan, but the atmosphere was still tense.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 86-7.</ref> Apparently the Portuguese peace appeal was only for gaining time to consolidate their strength, waiting for the right moment to repay Ternate.\n\nOn the pretext of discussing an urgent issue, Lopes de Mesquita invited Hairun to the fortress of S\u00e3o Paulo on 25 February 1570 for a meal. The sultan complied with the invitation and entered unattended, since his bodyguards were not allowed in. A nephew of the captain, Martim Afonso Pimentel, was posted just inside the gate. As the sultan came inside, Pimentel pierced him with his dagger and the  victim fell down dying.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 87.</ref> Mesquita assumed that by removing Hairun, Maluku would lose its only prominent leader and resistance be scattered. Here, however, he underestimated the anti-Portuguese resentment which had built up during the last decades, in particular canalized through Prince Baab.\n\n== Ascendance of Sultan Babullah ==\n=== Coronation as Sultan ===\nThe tragic death of Sultan Hairun triggered the anger of the Ternatans as well as the various kings of Maluku. The royal council, with the support of the people, brought forth Kaicili Baab as the next Sultan of Ternate, who carried the title of ''Sultan Babullah Datu Syah''. The new Sultan aimed to fight for reestablishing the banner of [[Islam]] in [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and make [[Ternate Sultanate]] into a powerful kingdom, and to force the Portuguese out of his kingdom.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. I, p. 40.</ref>\n\n=== Announcement of Jihad ===\nSultan Babullah did not waste any time after his inauguration. The sacred war or [[Jihad]] was announced throughout the realm. No less than his father he emerged as a capable coordinator of different ethnic and cultural groups in the eastern archipelago. To strengthen his position, Sultan Babullah married a sister of Sultan Gapi Baguna of Tidore.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 16.</ref> Some of the other Maluku Kings temporarily forgot their rivalry and united under one command under Sultan Babullah and the banner of Ternate, as did a number of kings and chiefs in the larger region. Sultan Babullah's cause was helped by a number of capable commanders, such as the King of Jailolo, the governor of [[Sula Islands|Sula]] Kapita Kapalaya, the Ambonese leader Kapita Kalakinka, and Kapitan Rubuhongi. According to Spanish sources, Sultan Babullah was able to mobilize 2,000 kora-kora and 133,300 soldiers under his banner, drawn from a vast area from [[Sulawesi]] to [[New Guinea]].<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887) \"De Europ\u00ebers in den Maleischen Archipel\", ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'', 25-35, Part V:1, p. 161-2.</ref> Although the numbers are debatable, they indicate the wide reach of his power and prestige.\n\n== Portuguese expulsion ==\n{{main | Portuguese-Ternate wars}}\nAfter the assassination of Hairun, Sultan Babullah demanded the handover of Lopes de Mesquita for trial. Portuguese fortresses in Ternate, namely Tolucco, Saint Lucia and Santo Pedro fell within short, leaving only the S\u00e3o Paulo Citadel as the residence of Mesquita. At the behest of Babullah the Ternate forces besieged S\u00e3o Paulo and severed its relationship with the outside world; the food supply was restricted to small rations of [[sago]], so that the inhabitants of the fort could just barely survive. The Ternatans nevertheless tolerated occasional contacts between the besieged and the islanders - it should be recalled that a lot of Ternatans had married Portuguese people and lived in the fort with their families. In their depressed state the Portuguese received Alvaro de Ataide as their new captain, replacing Lopes de Mesquita. This move did, however, alter Babullah's determination to oust the Europeans.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p.88-91. </ref>\n\nAlthough the siege of S\u00e3o Paulo was not pushed with full force, Sultan Babullah did not forget his oath. His forces attacked areas where the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] mission had made progress, and forced the baptized ruler of Bacan to revert to Islam in about 1575. He also took the war to Ambon where the Portuguese had constructed a fortress in 1569. In 1571 the 30-strong Ternate fleet, containing 3,000 troops under the leadership of Kapita Kalakinka (Kalakinda), invaded Ambon. The Ternatans managed to subjugate Hoamoal (in [[Seram Island|Ceram]]), [[Ambelau]], [[Manipa]], [[Kelang]] and [[Boano]]. The Portuguese troops under the captaincy of Sancho de Vasconcellos could keep their fortress with great difficulty, and lost much of their grip over the trade in cloves.<ref>Gerrit Knaap (2004) ''Kruidnagelen en Christenen: De VOC en de bevolking van Ambon 1656-1696''. Leiden: KITLV Press, p. 17-9.</ref> Vasconcellos, assisted by the Christian natives succeeded in repelling the troops of Ternate on [[Buru Island]] for a while but soon fell after Ternate renewed its assault under the leadership of Kapitan Rubuhongi.\n\nBy 1575 most the Portuguese positions in Maluku had fallen, and the indigenous tribes or kingdoms that had supported them were badly corned. There remained the S\u00e3o Paulo fortress that was still under siege. For five years the Portuguese and their families suffered a hard life in the castle, cut off from the outside world. Sultan Babullah finally gave an ultimatum to leave Ternate within 24 hours. Those who were indigenous in Ternate were allowed to remain on condition that they become royal subjects.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 92.</ref> The current captain Nuno Pereira de Lacerda accepted the conditions. This was the first major victory scored by people in what is now Indonesia over a Western power. It has been described as a very important event since it delayed Western colonization in the East Indian archipelago for a hundred years.\n\nThus, on 15 July 1575, the Portuguese left Ternate in disgrace; however, Babullah stood by his word and no-one was hurt. The importance of Melaka for the spice trade caused a degree of moderation. He made it clear that the Portuguese merchants could still arrive freely and that the prices in cloves remained as they had been. A Portuguese relief armada took the Portuguese on board and sailed over to Ambon where they strengthened the local garrison at what is today [[Ambon City]].<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:6, p. 455-6.</ref> Some ended up in [[Malacca]] while others proceeded to [[Solor]] and [[Timor]] where they engaged in the lucrative sandalwood trade and remained for the next 400 years.<ref>Arend van Roever (2002) ''De jacht op sandelhout: De VOC en de tweedeling van Timor in de zeventiende eeuw''. Zutphen: Walburg Pers.</ref>\n\n== Visit of Francis Drake ==\nOn 3 November 1579, Sultan Babullah received a visit of [[Francis Drake]], the well-known English seafarer and adventurer. Drake and his crew, achieving the second [[circumnavigation]] of the globe, came across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] with five ships, one of which was the legendary ''[[Golden Hind]]''. The Englishman described Babullah as a man of \"a tall stature, very corpulent and well set together, of a very princely and gratious countenance\".<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 98.</ref> In his dealings with Babullah, Drake was baffled since the Sultan did not seem interested in a joint campaign against the Iberians. Drake expressed his displeasure with the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Spain]] and described the current situation in [[Europe]]. Babullah received his guests with joy and entertained them in the palace. The ruler declared his eternal friendship with Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], apparently with the aim to play out the English against the Portuguese.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 95-6.</ref> In a sense their meeting was an embryo of diplomatic relations between [[Indonesia]] and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn a sumptuous banquet that took place after the negotiations, Drake and entourage were served dishes from sago, rice, various side dishes from goats, deer and chickens to roasted pork and canary (crab), all of which were cooked with clove herbs.\nBetween the Sultan and Francis Drake arose mutual respect. Francis Drake was impressed with Babullah. He left Ternate with a small quantity of prime quality clover, the sultan alongside the Ternate fleet accompanying the Drake ship to the high seas.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 102.</ref>\n\n=== Francis Drake's report ===\nSultan Babullah welcomed his guests with grand ceremonies at a special occasion. Francis Drake's report describes the atmosphere of the meeting;\n\n: '' \"While our people were waiting for the Sultan to come in about half an hour, they had a better chance to observe these things; also, before the arrival of the Sultan, there were three rows of old noble figures, who allegedly all were personal advisers to the king; at the end of the house was placed a group of young people, dressed and looking elegant. Outside the house, on the right, stood four men with gray hair, all dressed in long red robes to the ground, but the head coverings were not much different from the Turks; they were called Romans / Europeans, or foreigners, who were there as intermediaries to keep trade with this nation; there were also two Turks, one Italian as an intermediary, and lastly a Spaniard, freed from Portuguese hands by the Sultan when the island was recovered, who quit as a soldier to serve the Sultan. ''\n\n: '' The King finally came from the castle, with 8 or 10 senators following him, shaded with a very luxurious canopy (with gold ornaments embossed in the center), and guarded by 12 spears whose points were turned downwards; our people (accompanied by Moro, the sultan's brother), got up to meet him, and he very kindly welcomed and exchanged pleasantries with them. As we have described earlier, he spoke softly, with temperate speech, with the elegance of the attitude of a Sultan, and a Moor by nation. His clothes were in the fashion of other inhabitants of his country, but much more luxurious, as demanded by his existence and status; from the waist to the ground he wore very rich gold-embroidered cloth. His legs were bare, but on his feet were a pair of red velvet shoes; his headdresses encrusted with gold-plated rings, one or one and a half inches wide, which made them beautiful and princely, like a crown; on his neck he wore a chain of pure gold with very large links and one fold double; on his left hand was a diamond, an emerald, ruby and turquoise stones, 4 very beautiful and perfect gemstones; on his right hand, in a ring, was a big, perfect turquoise stone, and in the other ring were many smaller diamonds, which were very artistically set together. ''\n\n: '' Thus he sat on the throne of his kingdom, and on the right stood a servant with a very expensive fan (richly embroidered and decorated with sapphires). He fanned and gathered the air to cool the sultan, for his place was very hot, both because of the sun and the gathering of so many people. After some time, after the gentlemen had conveyed their message, and received an answer, they were allowed to leave, and were safely brought back by one of the chiefs of the Sultan's Council, which the Sultan himself commissioned to do\".<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 100-1. Slightly modernized text.</ref>\n\n== Sultan Babullah and the golden age of Ternate ==\nWith the departure of the Portuguese, Sultan Babullah converted S\u00e3o Paulo into his own fortress which also served as a palace. He renovated and fortified the stronghold and changed its name to Gamalama fortress. Under the aegis of Babullah the trading fleets from Melaka continued to arrive at Ternate from year to year, so that the flow of commerce with the European and wider world continued. No more granting of privileges were issued, thus Western merchants were treated similar to traders from other countries and they were kept under strict surveillance. Sultan Babullah even issued a regulation requiring every European arriving in Ternate to remove his hats and shoes, just to remind them not to forget themselves.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 94.</ref>\n\nSultan Babullah maintained or created a network of alliances with other rulers and places in the Indonesian Archipelago. The Javanese Muslims from the port kingdoms of the Pesisir (north coast) became the steady allies of Ternate.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1980) ''Documenta Malucensia'', Vol. II. Rome: Jesuit Historical Institute, p. 12.</ref> Frequent visits were undertaken to the areas claimed by Ternate, where their loyalty to the Sultan's policy was requested. In 1580 Babullah is said to have led a grand naval expedition (''hongi'') that visited a number of places in Sulawesi. The ruler also paid a visit to [[Makassar]] and met with the king of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]], Tunijallo. The two rulers concluded an alliance, whereby Babullah invited Tunijallo to convert to Islam. The king politely declined to become a Muslim, but as a sign of the new bond Sultan Babullah built a fortress at the Gowan coast called [[Fort Somba Opu|Somba Opu]]. His fleet then proceeded to conquer the island of [[Selayar Island|Selayar]] south of Sulawesi.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724) ''Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien'', Vol. I. Amsterdam: Onder den Linden, p. 107-8.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/208/mode/2up]</ref>\n\nUnder the leadership of Babullah, the Sultanate of Ternate reached its height of its glory. Early in his reign, the Sultan dispatched fleets to subjugate Buru, Ceram, parts of Ambon, and in 1580 the chiefdoms in North Sulawesi, [[Kingdom of Banggai|Banggai]], [[Bungku|Tobungku]] (both in eastern Sulawesi), Tiworo (south-eastern Sulawesi) and [[Buton]] fell under his sway. Ternatan influence was also felt in the [[Solor Islands]] close to Timor, with access to the Timorese sandalwood,<ref>Arend de Roever (2002) ''De jacht op sandelhout; De VOC en de tweedeling van Timor in de zeventiende eeuw''. Zutphen: Walburg Pers, p. 72.</ref> and on the nutmeg-producing [[Banda Islands]].<ref>Peter Lape ''Contact and conflict in the Banda Islands, Eastern Indonesia, 11th-17th centuries''. PhD thesis, Brown University, p. 64.</ref> A list of dependencies drawn up by the Spaniards in c. 1590 furthermore mentions [[Mindanao]], the [[Raja Ampat Islands|Papuan Islands]] and the [[Sumbawa|Sumbawan]] kingdoms [[Bima]] and Kore, though these places were probably only very loosely attached.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:1, p. 161-2.</ref> While the outlying areas were merely tributaries, other regions were placed under deputy rulers appointed by the sultan, called ''Sangaji'' (honoured prince). Babullah was nicknamed ''ruler of 72 islands'', as related by the Dutch historian and geographer [[Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn]] (1724).<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724) ''Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien'', Vol. I. Amsterdam: Onder den Linden, p. 108.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/208/mode/2up]</ref> At this stage the Ternate sultanate was the largest Islamic kingdom in eastern Indonesia.\n\n==Continued struggles with the Portuguese and Spaniards==\nHis rule was far from unopposed, however. The Sultan of Tidore, Gapi Baguna, had supported Babullah after the murder of Hairun, but grew increasingly uneasy with Ternate's power ambitions. He therefore sailed over to Ambon in 1576 to draw up a strategical alliance with the Portuguese. On his way back he was trapped by a Ternate fleet and captured, though he was liberated through a daring raid by his kinsman Kaicili Salama.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1974) ''Documenta Malucensia''. Rome: Jesuit Historical Society, p. 703-4.</ref> Gapi Baguna now allowed the Portuguese to build a fort on Tidore (1578), hoping to attract the clove trade and secure military backing against Ternate. After the [[Iberian Union|merger of Portugal with Spain]] in 1581, forces from the [[Spanish Philippines]] backed up the Iberian positions in Maluku. A Spanish force arrived to Tidore in 1582, and attempted to weaken Babullah through incursions on Ternate. However, the Spaniards were badly afflicted by an epidemic and had to return to [[Manila]] without achieving anything much.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:3, p. 179.</ref> The full consequences of the Spanish position in the Philippines were felt by Babullah's successor Saidi Berkat in 1606.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 133, 140</ref>\n\n==Muslim diplomacy==\nThe Sultan continued his father's policy of establishing ties with faraway Muslim polities. His envoy Kaicili Naik was dispatched to [[Lisbon]] where he met [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] of Spain and Portugal and demanded that Hairun's murderer should be punished (Pimentel had actually already been killed in an incident in Java). The negotiations were inconclusive; however, the main purpose of the embassy was to make alliances on the way with Islamic rulers in [[Brunei]], [[Aceh]] and [[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]] ([[Banten]]?). When Kaicili Naik finally returned to Ternate after a successful mission, Babullah had already passed away.<ref>P.A, Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:4, p. 199.</ref> Persons from the [[Ottoman Empire]] stayed at the court, and the Portuguese anxiously wrote about intimate contacts with Muslim figures from Aceh, the Malay World, and even [[Mecca]]. Javanese from [[Japara]] and other port kingdoms also assisted Ternate via Ambon. These far-flung contacts were signs of lively trade routes that had developed between different parts of Asia since the 15th century, which carried with them religious-cultural bonds. While the presence of Islam in Maluku had been patchy up to the mid-16th century, the age of Babullah and his successors saw a dissemination and deepening of religious observances, partly as a response to aggressive Catholic advances.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 132-7.</ref>\n\n== Ternate post Babullah ==\nSultan Babullah passed away in July 1583.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:3, p. 180.</ref> The cause and place of his death are debatable. According to a late and unreliable story (by Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn, 1724), he was lured on board a Portuguese ship and treacherously taken prisoner. The Sultan was brought towards [[Goa (India)|Goa]] but passed away at sea. Other accounts allege that he was killed at home through poison or magic.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 106.</ref> Whatever the circumstances, the strong and crafty Babullah was an inspiring leader who left a void that his successors could not entirely fill. In the history of Indonesia up to the 20th century, he was the only major leader who was able to win an absolute and uncontested victory over a Western power. His success in making Ternate into an extensive realm that reached its height of success in the late 16th century is only part of the picture. He also succeeded in instilling his people's confidence and rise up against a foreign power that strove to dominate their lives.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 136-7.</ref> After the time of Sultan Babullah, no other leaders in Ternate and Maluku matched his caliber. In the face of new Spanish and Dutch advances in the early 17th century, the fabric of the Ternate polity proved too fragile to withstand colonial subordination.\n\nSultan Babullah was succeeded by his son Sultan [[Saidi Berkat]] (r. 1583-1606) who continued to wage war against the Portuguese and the Spanish with shifting success.\n\n== Family ==\nSultan Babullah Datu Syah had the following known wives or co-wives:\n* A sister of Sultan Gapi Baguna of Tidore\n* Bega, from the [[Sula Islands]], mother of Saidi\n\nHis known children were:\n* Sultan [[Saidi Berkat]] (c. 1563-1628), ruler of Ternate 1583-1606\n* Boki Ainalyakin, married Kodrat, Sultan of Jailolo\n* Boki Randangagalo, married to a Sultan of Tidore, later with a Sultan of Bacan\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spice trade]]\n* [[List of rulers of Maluku]]\n* [[Sultanate of Ternate]]\n* [[Tidore Sultanate]]\n* [[Estado da India]]\n\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box\n| before = [[Hairun]]\n| title = [[Sultan of Ternate]]\n| years = 1570-1583\n| after = [[Saidi Berkat]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* M.

February 10, 1528 (?) - d. July 1583), also known as '''Sultan Baabullah''' (or '''Babu''' [Baab] in Europan sources) was the 7th [[Sultan]] and 24th ruler of the [[Sultanate of Ternate]] in [[Maluku islands|Maluku]] who ruled between 1570 and 1583. He was known as the greatest Sultan in Ternatan and Malukan history, who defeated the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] occupants in Ternate and led the Sultanate to a golden peak at the end of the 16th century. Sultan Babullah was commonly known as the ruler of 72 inhabited islands in eastern Indonesia, including most of the [[Maluku Islands]], [[Sangihe Islands|Sangihe]] and parts of [[Sulawesi]], with influences as far as [[Solor]], [[Bima|East Sumbawa]], [[Mindanao]], and the [[Raja Ampat|Papuan Islands]].<ref>Robert Cribb (2000) ''Historical atlas of Indonesia''.

Tiele IV:3, p. 418-20, IV:5, p. 440.</ref>\n\nIn spite of all these conflicts, the Ternate-Portuguese relationship was not entirely broken. The officer Gonsalo Pereira led an expedition to the [[Philippines]] in 1569, where the rulers of Tidore, Bacan and Ternate were summoned to participate. Prince Baab showed up with fifteen ''korakoras'' (large outriggers). However, since Ternate had little interest in this venture, Baab diverted on the way and brought his fleet to the [[Melaka Straits]] where he performed acts of piracy. He nevertheless lost 300 men in the enterprise. The Portuguese enterprise in the Philippines likewise turned out to be a failure, to the ill-concealed satisfaction of Hairun.<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:5, p. 438.</ref>\n\n== The death of Sultan Hairun ==\nAfter the contest for Ambon Island, Hairun strengthened his power year by year which worried the Portuguese leaders. Portuguese-influenced areas in [[Halmahera]] were attacked by his forces. Since he dominated the waterways he could stop the vital deliveries of foodstuff from Moro in Halmahera to the Portuguese settlement in Ternate.<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:4, p. 441-3.</ref> In 1570 Captain Diogo Lopes de Mesquita (1566-1570) undertook an official reconciliation with the sultan, but the atmosphere was still tense.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 86-7.</ref> Apparently the Portuguese peace appeal was only for gaining time to consolidate their strength, waiting for the right moment to repay Ternate.\n\nOn the pretext of discussing an urgent issue, Lopes de Mesquita invited Hairun to the fortress of S\u00e3o Paulo on 25 February 1570 for a meal. The sultan complied with the invitation and entered unattended, since his bodyguards were not allowed in. A nephew of the captain, Martim Afonso Pimentel, was posted just inside the gate. As the sultan came inside, Pimentel pierced him with his dagger and the  victim fell down dying.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 87.</ref> Mesquita assumed that by removing Hairun, Maluku would lose its only prominent leader and resistance be scattered. Here, however, he underestimated the anti-Portuguese resentment which had built up during the last decades, in particular canalized through Prince Baab.\n\n== Ascendance of Sultan Babullah ==\n=== Coronation as Sultan ===\nThe tragic death of Sultan Hairun triggered the anger of the Ternatans as well as the various kings of Maluku. The royal council, with the support of the people, brought forth Kaicili Baab as the next Sultan of Ternate, who carried the title of ''Sultan Babullah Datu Syah''. The new Sultan aimed to fight for reestablishing the banner of [[Islam]] in [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and make [[Ternate Sultanate]] into a powerful kingdom, and to force the Portuguese out of his kingdom.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. I, p. 40.</ref>\n\n=== Announcement of Jihad ===\nSultan Babullah did not waste any time after his inauguration. The sacred war or [[Jihad]] was announced throughout the realm. No less than his father he emerged as a capable coordinator of different ethnic and cultural groups in the eastern archipelago. To strengthen his position, Sultan Babullah married a sister of Sultan Gapi Baguna of Tidore.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 16.</ref> Some of the other Maluku Kings temporarily forgot their rivalry and united under one command under Sultan Babullah and the banner of Ternate, as did a number of kings and chiefs in the larger region. Sultan Babullah's cause was helped by a number of capable commanders, such as the King of Jailolo, the governor of [[Sula Islands|Sula]] Kapita Kapalaya, the Ambonese leader Kapita Kalakinka, and Kapitan Rubuhongi. According to Spanish sources, Sultan Babullah was able to mobilize 2,000 kora-kora and 133,300 soldiers under his banner, drawn from a vast area from [[Sulawesi]] to [[New Guinea]].<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887) \"De Europ\u00ebers in den Maleischen Archipel\", ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'', 25-35, Part V:1, p. 161-2.</ref> Although the numbers are debatable, they indicate the wide reach of his power and prestige.\n\n== Portuguese expulsion ==\n{{main | Portuguese-Ternate wars}}\nAfter the assassination of Hairun, Sultan Babullah demanded the handover of Lopes de Mesquita for trial. Portuguese fortresses in Ternate, namely Tolucco, Saint Lucia and Santo Pedro fell within short, leaving only the S\u00e3o Paulo Citadel as the residence of Mesquita. At the behest of Babullah the Ternate forces besieged S\u00e3o Paulo and severed its relationship with the outside world; the food supply was restricted to small rations of [[sago]], so that the inhabitants of the fort could just barely survive. The Ternatans nevertheless tolerated occasional contacts between the besieged and the islanders - it should be recalled that a lot of Ternatans had married Portuguese people and lived in the fort with their families. In their depressed state the Portuguese received Alvaro de Ataide as their new captain, replacing Lopes de Mesquita. This move did, however, alter Babullah's determination to oust the Europeans.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p.88-91. </ref>\n\nAlthough the siege of S\u00e3o Paulo was not pushed with full force, Sultan Babullah did not forget his oath. His forces attacked areas where the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] mission had made progress, and forced the baptized ruler of Bacan to revert to Islam in about 1575. He also took the war to Ambon where the Portuguese had constructed a fortress in 1569. In 1571 the 30-strong Ternate fleet, containing 3,000 troops under the leadership of Kapita Kalakinka (Kalakinda), invaded Ambon. The Ternatans managed to subjugate Hoamoal (in [[Ceram]]), [[Ambelau]], [[Manipa]], [[Kelang]] and [[Boano]]. The Portuguese troops under the captaincy of Sancho de Vasconcellos could keep their fortress with great difficulty, and lost much of their grip over the trade in cloves.<ref>Gerrit Knaap (2004) ''Kruidnagelen en Christenen: De VOC en de bevolking van Ambon 1656-1696''. Leiden: KITLV Press, p. 17-9.</ref> Vasconcellos, assisted by the Christian natives succeeded in repelling the troops of Ternate on [[Buru Island]] for a while but soon fell after Ternate renewed its assault under the leadership of Kapitan Rubuhongi.\n\nBy 1575 most the Portuguese positions in Maluku had fallen, and the indigenous tribes or kingdoms that had supported them were badly corned. There remained the S\u00e3o Paulo fortress that was still under siege. For five years the Portuguese and their families suffered a hard life in the castle, cut off from the outside world. Sultan Babullah finally gave an ultimatum to leave Ternate within 24 hours. Those who were indigenous in Ternate were allowed to remain on condition that they become royal subjects.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 92.</ref> The current captain Nuno Pereira de Lacerda accepted the conditions. This was the first major victory scored by people in what is now Indonesia over a Western power. It has been described as a very important event since it delayed Western colonization in the East Indian archipelago for a hundred years.\n\nThus, on 15 July 1575, the Portuguese left Ternate in disgrace; however, Babullah stood by his word and no-one was hurt. The importance of Melaka for the spice trade caused a degree of moderation. He made it clear that the Portuguese merchants could still arrive freely and that the prices in cloves remained as they had been. A Portuguese relief armada took the Portuguese on board and sailed over to Ambon where they strengthened the local garrison at what is today [[Ambon City]].<ref>P.A. Tiele IV:6, p. 455-6.</ref> Some ended up in [[Malacca]] while others proceeded to [[Solor]] and [[Timor]] where they engaged in the lucrative sandalwood trade and remained for the next 400 years.<ref>Arend van Roever (2002) ''De jacht op sandelhout: De VOC en de tweedeling van Timor in de zeventiende eeuw''. Zutphen: Walburg Pers.</ref>\n\n== Visit of Francis Drake ==\nOn 3 November 1579, Sultan Babullah received a visit of [[Francis Drake]], the well-known English seafarer and adventurer. Drake and his crew, achieving the second [[circumnavigation]] of the globe, came across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] with five ships, one of which was the legendary ''[[Golden Hind]]''. The Englishman described Babullah as a man of \"a tall stature, very corpulent and well set together, of a very princely and gratious countenance\".<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 98.</ref> In his dealings with Babullah, Drake was baffled since the Sultan did not seem interested in a joint campaign against the Iberians. Drake expressed his displeasure with the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Spain]] and described the current situation in [[Europe]]. Babullah received his guests with joy and entertained them in the palace. The ruler declared his eternal friendship with Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], apparently with the aim to play out the English against the Portuguese.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 95-6.</ref> In a sense their meeting was an embryo of diplomatic relations between [[Indonesia]] and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn a sumptuous banquet that took place after the negotiations, Drake and entourage were served dishes from sago, rice, various side dishes from goats, deer and chickens to roasted pork and canary (crab), all of which were cooked with clove herbs.\nBetween the Sultan and Francis Drake arose mutual respect. Francis Drake was impressed with Babullah. He left Ternate with a small quantity of prime quality clover, the sultan alongside the Ternate fleet accompanying the Drake ship to the high seas.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 102.</ref>\n\n=== Francis Drake's report ===\nSultan Babullah welcomed his guests with grand ceremonies at a special occasion. Francis Drake's report describes the atmosphere of the meeting;\n\n: '' \"While our people were waiting for the Sultan to come in about half an hour, they had a better chance to observe these things; also, before the arrival of the Sultan, there were three rows of old noble figures, who allegedly all were personal advisers to the king; at the end of the house was placed a group of young people, dressed and looking elegant. Outside the house, on the right, stood four men with gray hair, all dressed in long red robes to the ground, but the head coverings were not much different from the Turks; they were called Romans / Europeans, or foreigners, who were there as intermediaries to keep trade with this nation; there were also two Turks, one Italian as an intermediary, and lastly a Spaniard, freed from Portuguese hands by the Sultan when the island was recovered, who quit as a soldier to serve the Sultan. ''\n\n: '' The King finally came from the castle, with 8 or 10 senators following him, shaded with a very luxurious canopy (with gold ornaments embossed in the center), and guarded by 12 spears whose points were turned downwards; our people (accompanied by Moro, the sultan's brother), got up to meet him, and he very kindly welcomed and exchanged pleasantries with them. As we have described earlier, he spoke softly, with temperate speech, with the elegance of the attitude of a Sultan, and a Moor by nation. His clothes were in the fashion of other inhabitants of his country, but much more luxurious, as demanded by his existence and status; from the waist to the ground he wore very rich gold-embroidered cloth. His legs were bare, but on his feet were a pair of red velvet shoes; his headdresses encrusted with gold-plated rings, one or one and a half inches wide, which made them beautiful and princely, like a crown; on his neck he wore a chain of pure gold with very large links and one fold double; on his left hand was a diamond, an emerald, ruby and turquoise stones, 4 very beautiful and perfect gemstones; on his right hand, in a ring, was a big, perfect turquoise stone, and in the other ring were many smaller diamonds, which were very artistically set together. ''\n\n: '' Thus he sat on the throne of his kingdom, and on the right stood a servant with a very expensive fan (richly embroidered and decorated with sapphires). He fanned and gathered the air to cool the sultan, for his place was very hot, both because of the sun and the gathering of so many people. After some time, after the gentlemen had conveyed their message, and received an answer, they were allowed to leave, and were safely brought back by one of the chiefs of the Sultan's Council, which the Sultan himself commissioned to do\".<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 100-1. Slightly modernized text.</ref>\n\n== Sultan Babullah and the golden age of Ternate ==\nWith the departure of the Portuguese, Sultan Babullah converted S\u00e3o Paulo into his own fortress which also served as a palace. He renovated and fortified the stronghold and changed its name to Gamalama fortress. Under the aegis of Babullah the trading fleets from Melaka continued to arrive at Ternate from year to year, so that the flow of commerce with the European and wider world continued. No more granting of privileges were issued, thus Western merchants were treated similar to traders from other countries and they were kept under strict surveillance. Sultan Babullah even issued a regulation requiring every European arriving in Ternate to remove his hats and shoes, just to remind them not to forget themselves.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 94.</ref>\n\nSultan Babullah maintained or created a network of alliances with other rulers and places in the Indonesian Archipelago. The Javanese Muslims from the port kingdoms of the Pesisir (north coast) became the steady allies of Ternate.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1980) ''Documenta Malucensia'', Vol. II. Rome: Jesuit Historical Institute, p. 12.</ref> Frequent visits were undertaken to the areas claimed by Ternate, where their loyalty to the Sultan's policy was requested. In 1580 Babullah is said to have led a grand naval expedition (''hongi'') that visited a number of places in Sulawesi. The ruler also paid a visit to [[Makassar]] and met with the king of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]], Tunijallo. The two rulers concluded an alliance, whereby Babullah invited Tunijallo to convert to Islam. The king politely declined to become a Muslim, but as a sign of the new bond Sultan Babullah built a fortress at the Gowan coast called [[Fort Somba Opu|Somba Opu]]. His fleet then proceeded to conquer the island of [[Selayar]] south of Sulawesi.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724) ''Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien'', Vol. I. Amsterdam: Onder den Linden, p. 107-8.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/208/mode/2up]</ref>\n\nUnder the leadership of Babullah, the Sultanate of Ternate reached its height of its glory. Early in his reign, the Sultan dispatched fleets to subjugate Buru, Ceram, parts of Ambon, and in 1580 the chiefdoms in North Sulawesi, [[Kingdom of Banggai|Banggai]], [[Bungku|Tobungku]] (both in eastern Sulawesi), Tiworo (south-eastern Sulawesi) and [[Buton]] fell under his sway. Ternatan influence was also felt in the [[Solor Islands]] close to Timor, with access to the Timorese sandalwood,<ref>Arend de Roever (2002) ''De jacht op sandelhout; De VOC en de tweedeling van Timor in de zeventiende eeuw''. Zutphen: Walburg Pers, p. 72.</ref> and on the nutmeg-producing [[Banda Islands]].<ref>Peter Lape ''Contact and conflict in the Banda Islands, Eastern Indonesia, 11th-17th centuries''. PhD thesis, Brown University, p. 64.</ref> A list of dependencies drawn up by the Spaniards in c. 1590 furthermore mentions [[Mindanao]], the [[Raja Ampat Islands|Papuan Islands]] and the [[Sumbawa|Sumbawan]] kingdoms [[Bima]] and Kore, though these places were probably only very loosely attached.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:1, p. 161-2.</ref> While the outlying areas were merely tributaries, other regions were placed under deputy rulers appointed by the sultan, called ''Sangaji'' (honoured prince). Babullah was nicknamed ''ruler of 72 islands'', as related by the Dutch historian and geographer [[Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn]] (1724).<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724) ''Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien'', Vol. I. Amsterdam: Onder den Linden, p. 108.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/208/mode/2up]</ref> At this stage the Ternate sultanate was the largest Islamic kingdom in eastern Indonesia.\n\n==Continued struggles with the Portuguese and Spaniards==\nHis rule was far from unopposed, however. The Sultan of Tidore, Gapi Baguna, had supported Babullah after the murder of Hairun, but grew increasingly uneasy with Ternate's power ambitions. He therefore sailed over to Ambon in 1576 to draw up a strategical alliance with the Portuguese. On his way back he was trapped by a Ternate fleet and captured, though he was liberated through a daring raid by his kinsman Kaicili Salama.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1974) ''Documenta Malucensia''. Rome: Jesuit Historical Society, p. 703-4.</ref> Gapi Baguna now allowed the Portuguese to build a fort on Tidore (1578), hoping to attract the clove trade and secure military backing against Ternate. After the [[Iberian Union|merger of Portugal with Spain]] in 1581, forces from the [[Spanish Philippines]] backed up the Iberian positions in Maluku. A Spanish force arrived to Tidore in 1582, and attempted to weaken Babullah through incursions on Ternate. However, the Spaniards were badly afflicted by an epidemic and had to return to [[Manila]] without achieving anything much.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:3, p. 179.</ref> The full consequences of the Spanish position in the Philippines were felt by Babullah's successor Saidi Berkat in 1606.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 133, 140</ref>\n\n==Muslim diplomacy==\nThe Sultan continued his father's policy of establishing ties with faraway Muslim polities. His envoy Kaicili Naik was dispatched to [[Lisbon]] where he met [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] of Spain and Portugal and demanded that Hairun's murderer should be punished (Pimentel had actually already been killed in an incident in Java). The negotiations were inconclusive; however, the main purpose of the embassy was to make alliances on the way with Islamic rulers in [[Brunei]], [[Aceh]] and [[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]] ([[Banten]]?). When Kaicili Naik finally returned to Ternate after a successful mission, Babullah had already passed away.<ref>P.A, Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:4, p. 199.</ref> Persons from the [[Ottoman Empire]] stayed at the court, and the Portuguese anxiously wrote about intimate contacts with Muslim figures from Aceh, the Malay World, and even [[Mecca]]. Javanese from [[Japara]] and other port kingdoms also assisted Ternate via Ambon. These far-flung contacts were signs of lively trade routes that had developed between different parts of Asia since the 15th century, which carried with them religious-cultural bonds. While the presence of Islam in Maluku had been patchy up to the mid-16th century, the age of Babullah and his successors saw a dissemination and deepening of religious observances, partly as a response to aggressive Catholic advances.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 132-7.</ref>\n\n== Ternate post Babullah ==\nSultan Babullah passed away in July 1583.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1877-1887), Part V:3, p. 180.</ref> The cause and place of his death are debatable. According to a late and unreliable story (by Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn, 1724), he was lured on board a Portuguese ship and treacherously taken prisoner. The Sultan was brought towards [[Goa (India)|Goa]] but passed away at sea. Other accounts allege that he was killed at home through poison or magic.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990), p. 106.</ref> Whatever the circumstances, the strong and crafty Babullah was an inspiring leader who left a void that his successors could not entirely fill. In the history of Indonesia up to the 20th century, he was the only major leader who was able to win an absolute and uncontested victory over a Western power. His success in making Ternate into an extensive realm that reached its height of success in the late 16th century is only part of the picture. He also succeeded in instilling his people's confidence and rise up against a foreign power that strove to dominate their lives.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 136-7.</ref> After the time of Sultan Babullah, no other leaders in Ternate and Maluku matched his caliber. In the face of new Spanish and Dutch advances in the early 17th century, the fabric of the Ternate polity proved too fragile to withstand colonial subordination.\n\nSultan Babullah was succeeded by his son Sultan [[Saidi Berkat]] (r. 1583-1606) who continued to wage war against the Portuguese and the Spanish with shifting success.\n\n== Family ==\nSultan Babullah Datu Syah had the following known wives or co-wives:\n* A sister of Sultan Gapi Baguna of Tidore\n* Bega, from the [[Sula Islands]], mother of Saidi\n\nHis known children were:\n* Sultan [[Saidi Berkat]] (c. 1563-1628), ruler of Ternate 1583-1606\n* Boki Ainalyakin, married Kodrat, Sultan of Jailolo\n* Boki Randangagalo, married to a Sultan of Tidore, later with a Sultan of Bacan\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spice trade]]\n* [[List of rulers of Maluku]]\n* [[Sultanate of Ternate]]\n* [[Tidore Sultanate]]\n* [[Estado da India]]\n\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box\n| before = [[Hairun]]\n| title = [[Sultan of Ternate]]\n| years = 1570-1583\n| after = [[Saidi Berkat]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* M.

The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the [[Indian Appropriations Act#1871|Indian Appropriations Act of 1871]] ended recognition of independent native nations, and started treating them as \"domestic dependent nations\" subject to federal law. This law did preserve the rights and privileges agreed to under the treaties, including a large degree of [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]]. For this reason, many (but not all) Native American reservations are still independent of state law and actions of tribal citizens on these reservations are subject only to tribal courts and federal law.\n\nThe [[Indian Citizenship Act]] of 1924 granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans born in the United States who had not yet obtained it. This emptied the \"Indians not taxed\" category established by the [[United States Constitution]], allowed natives to vote in state and federal elections, and extended the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] protections granted to people \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. However, some states continued to deny [[Native American civil rights#Voting|Native Americans voting rights]] for several decades. Bill of Rights protections do not apply to tribal governments, except for those mandated by the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\nSince the end of the 15th century, the [[migration of Europeans to the Americas]] has led to centuries of population, cultural, and agricultural transfer and adjustment between [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]] societies, a process known as the [[Columbian exchange]]. As most Native American groups had historically preserved their histories by [[oral tradition]]s and artwork, the first written sources of the conflict were written by Europeans.<ref name=\"test\">Calloway, Colin G.

The ten cultural areas are as follows:\n\n* [[Circumpolar peoples|Arctic]], including [[Aleut people|Aleut]], [[Inuit]], and [[Yupik peoples]]\n* [[Alaska natives|Subarctic]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeastern Woodlands]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands|Southeastern Woodlands]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains|Great Plains]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin|Great Basin]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau|Northwest Plateau]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Northwest Coast]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of California|California]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the North American Southwest|Southwest]] ([[Oasisamerica]])\n\nAt the time of the first contact, the indigenous cultures were quite different from those of the proto-industrial and mostly [[Christianity|Christian]] immigrants. Some Northeastern and Southwestern cultures, in particular, were [[matrilineal]] and operated on a more collective basis than that with which Europeans were familiar. The majority of indigenous American tribes maintained their hunting grounds and agricultural lands for use of the entire tribe. Europeans at that time had [[patriarchal]] cultures and had developed concepts of individual [[property rights]] with respect to land that were extremely different. The differences in cultures between the established Native Americans and immigrant Europeans, as well as shifting alliances among different nations in times of war, caused extensive political tension, ethnic violence, and social disruption.\n\nEven before the European settlement of what is now the United States, Native Americans suffered high fatalities from [[Native American disease and epidemics|contact with new European diseases]], to which they had not yet acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]; the diseases were endemic to the Spanish and other Europeans, and spread by direct contact and likely through pigs that escaped from expeditions.<ref name=\"mann\"/> [[Smallpox epidemics in the Americas|Smallpox epidemics]] are thought to have caused the greatest loss of life for indigenous populations.

Native Americans believed this forced relocation illegal, given the [[Treaty of Hopewell]] of 1785. Under President [[Andrew Jackson]], [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830, which authorized the President to conduct treaties to exchange Native American land east of the [[Mississippi River]] for lands west of the river.\n\nAs many as 100,000 Native Americans relocated to the West as a result of this [[Indian removal]] policy. In theory, relocation was supposed to be voluntary and many Native Americans did remain in the East. In practice, great pressure was put on Native American leaders to sign removal treaties. The most egregious violation, the [[Trail of Tears]], was the removal of the Cherokee by [[Andrew Jackson|President Jackson]] to [[Indian Territory]].<ref>Carter (III), Samuel (1976).

Under the leadership of [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]] the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) brought in progressive educators to reshape Indian education. The BIA by 1938 taught 30,000 students in 377 boarding and day schools, or 40% of all Indian children in school. The [[Navajo]] largely opposed schooling of any sort, but the other tribes accepted the system.

The resulting increase in contact with the world outside of the reservation system brought profound changes to Native American culture. \"The war\", said the U.S. Indian Commissioner in 1945, \"caused the greatest disruption of Native life since the beginning of the reservation era\", affecting the habits, views, and economic well-being of tribal members.<ref>Bernstein, p. 131</ref> The most significant of these changes was the opportunity\u2014as a result of wartime labor shortages\u2014to find well-paying work in cities, and many people relocated to urban areas, particularly on the West Coast with the buildup of the defense industry.\n\nThere were also losses as a result of the war. For instance, a total of 1,200 [[Pueblo Indians|Pueblo]] men served in World War II; only about half came home alive. In addition, many more [[Navajo people|Navajo]] served as [[code talker]]s for the military in the Pacific. The code they made, although [[cryptology|cryptologically]] very simple, was never cracked by the Japanese.\n\n====Self-determination====\n{{main|Native American self-determination|Native American civil rights}}\n\nMilitary service and urban residency contributed to the rise of American Indian activism, particularly after the 1960s and the [[occupation of Alcatraz Island]] (1969\u20131971) by a student Indian group from [[San Francisco]]. In the same period, the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) was founded in [[Minneapolis]], and chapters were established throughout the country, where American Indians combined spiritual and political activism. Political protests gained national media attention and the sympathy of the American public.\n\nThrough the mid-1970s, conflicts between governments and Native Americans occasionally erupted into violence. A notable late 20th-century event was the [[Wounded Knee incident]] on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]]. Upset with tribal government and the failures of the federal government to enforce treaty rights, about 300 [[Oglala Lakota]] and AIM activists took control of [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota|Wounded Knee]] on February 27, 1973.<ref name=\"Waldron\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/28/archives/shot-kills-indian-at-wounded-knee-another-insurgent-is-hurt-during.html |title=Shot Kills Indian At Wounded Knee |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date= April 28, 1973|accessdate=August 22, 2010|first=Martin|last=Waldron}}</ref>\n\nIndian activists from around the country joined them at Pine Ridge, and the occupation became a symbol of rising American Indian identity and power. Federal law enforcement officials and the national guard cordoned off the town, and the two sides had a standoff for 71 days. During much gunfire, one [[United States Marshal]] was wounded and paralyzed. In late April, a Cherokee and local Lakota man were killed by gunfire; the Lakota elders ended the occupation to ensure no more lives were lost.<ref name=\"Waldron\"/>\n\nIn June 1975, two FBI agents seeking to make an armed robbery arrest at Pine Ridge Reservation were wounded in a firefight, and killed at close range. The AIM activist [[Leonard Peltier]] was sentenced in 1976 to two consecutive terms of life in prison in the FBI deaths.<ref>{{cite news |last=Crosson |first=Judith |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/11/05/appeals_court_denies_peltiers_parole_bid/ |title=Appeals court denies Peltier's parole bid |publisher=Boston.com |date=November 5, 2003 |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, the government enacted the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968|Indian Civil Rights Act]]. This gave tribal members most of the protections against abuses by tribal governments that the Bill of Rights accords to all U.S. citizens with respect to the federal government.<ref>Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 IDAHO LAW REVIEW 465 (1998).</ref> In 1975, the U.S. government passed the [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act]], marking the culmination of fifteen years of policy changes. It resulted from American Indian activism, the Civil Rights Movement, and community development aspects of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s social programs of the 1960s. The Act recognized the right and need of Native Americans for self-determination. It marked the U.S. government's turn away from the 1950s policy of termination of the relationship between tribes and the government. The U.S. government encouraged Native Americans' efforts at self-government and determining their futures. Tribes have developed organizations to administer their own social, welfare and housing programs, for instance. Tribal self-determination has created tension with respect to the federal government's historic trust obligation to care for Indians; however, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has never lived up to that responsibility.<ref>Robert J.

Tensions immediately arose between two philosophies: one that the tribal colleges should have the same criteria, curriculum and procedures for educational quality as mainstream colleges, the other that the faculty and curriculum should be closely adapted to the particular historical culture of the tribe. There was a great deal of turnover, exacerbated by very tight budgets.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gregory | first1 = T. | last2 = Thaxton | first2 = Lourene | year = 2007 | title = Robert A.

Thirty-two tribal colleges in the United States belong to the [[American Indian Higher Education Consortium]]. By the early 21st century, tribal nations had also established numerous language revival programs in their schools.\n\nIn addition, Native American activism has led major universities across the country to establish [[Native American studies]] programs and departments, increasing awareness of the strengths of Indian cultures, providing opportunities for academics, and deepening research on history and cultures in the United States. Native Americans have entered academia; journalism and media; politics at local, state and federal levels; and public service, for instance, influencing medical research and policy to identify issues related to American Indians.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Byron Mallott inaugural speech.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byron Mallott]], an [[Alaska Native]], is the former [[Democratic party (U.S.)|Democratic]] lieutenant governor of [[Alaska]].]]\nIn 2009, an \"apology to Native Peoples of the United States\" was included in the Defense Appropriations Act.

Urban areas with significant Native American populations include Minneapolis, Denver, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Tucson, Chicago, Oklahoma City, Houston, New York City, Los Angeles, and Rapid City. Many lived in poverty. Racism, unemployment, drugs and gangs were common problems which Indian social service organizations such as the Little Earth housing complex in Minneapolis attempted to address.<ref name=NYT41413 /> Grassroots efforts to support urban Indigenous populations have also taken place, as in the case of [[Bringing the Circle Together]] in Los Angeles.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Further|Modern social statistics of Native Americans}}\n{{See also|Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n\nThe 2010 Census showed that the U.S. population on April 1, 2010, was 308.7 million.<ref name=\"2010 Census AMAN\" /> Out of the total U.S. population, 2.9 million people, or 0.9 percent, reported American Indian or Alaska Native alone. In addition, 2.3 million people, or another 0.7 percent, reported American Indian or Alaska Native in combination with one or more other races. Together, these two groups totaled 5.2 million people.

But gaining federal recognition as a tribe is extremely difficult; to be established as a tribal group, members have to submit extensive [[genealogy|genealogical]] proof of tribal descent and continuity of the tribe as a culture.\n\n[[File:Abandoned Mines Shiprock 2009.jpg|thumb|Native peoples are concerned about the effects of [[Uranium mining and the Navajo people|abandoned uranium mines]] on or near their lands.]]\nIn July 2000, the [[Washington State Republican Party]] adopted a resolution recommending that the federal and legislative branches of the [[U.S. government]] terminate tribal governments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiancountry.com/articles/headline-2000-07-12-01.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000902214724/http://www.indiancountry.com/articles/headline-2000-07-12-01.shtml |archivedate=September 2, 2000 |title=Washington GOP plank to terminate tribes ignites firestorm |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> In 2007, a group of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] congressmen and congresswomen introduced a bill in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] to \"terminate\" the [[Cherokee Nation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tanasijournal.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=365&Itemid=1&ed=53 |title=National Congress of American Indians Opposes Bill to Terminate the Cherokee Nation |date=July 7, 2007 |website=Tanasi Journal |publisher=Wisdom Keepers, Inc. |accessdate=November 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510034518/http://www.tanasijournal.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=365&Itemid=1&ed=53 |archivedate=May 10, 2009 }}</ref> This was related to their voting to exclude Cherokee Freedmen as members of the tribe unless they had a Cherokee ancestor on the Dawes Rolls, although all Cherokee Freedmen and their descendants had been members since 1866.\n\nAs of 2004, various Native Americans are wary of attempts by others to gain control of their reservation lands for natural resources, such as [[coal]] and [[uranium]] in the West.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/band/senaaeurope/DRelocation.html |website=Senaa |title=The Genocide and Relocation of the Dine'h (Navajo) |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://lists.wayne.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9703&L=tamha&F=&S=&P=7661 |website=LISTSERV at Wayne State University|title=Big Mountain Update 1 February 1997 |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn the state of [[Virginia]], Native Americans face a unique problem. Until 2017 Virginia previously had no federally recognized tribes but the state had recognized eight. This is related historically to the greater impact of disease and warfare on the Virginia Indian populations, as well as their intermarriage with Europeans and Africans. Some people confused the ancestry with culture, but groups of Virginia Indians maintained their cultural continuity. Most of their early reservations were ended under the pressure of early European settlement.\n\nSome historians also note the problems of Virginia Indians in establishing documented continuity of identity, due to the work of [[Walter Ashby Plecker]] (1912\u20131946). As registrar of the state's Bureau of Vital Statistics, he applied his own interpretation of the [[one-drop rule]], enacted in law in 1924 as the state's Racial Integrity Act. It recognized only two races: \"white\" and \"colored\".\n\nPlecker, a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregationist]], believed that the state's Native Americans had been \"mongrelized\" by intermarriage with [[African American]]s; to him, ancestry determined identity, rather than culture. He thought that some people of partial black ancestry were trying to \"[[passing (racial identity)|pass]]\" as Native Americans. Plecker thought that anyone with any African heritage had to be classified as colored, regardless of appearance, amount of European or Native American ancestry, and cultural/community identification. Plecker pressured local governments into reclassifying all Native Americans in the state as \"colored\", and gave them lists of family surnames to examine for reclassification based on his interpretation of data and the law. This led to the state's destruction of accurate records related to families and communities who identified as Native American (as in church records and daily life). By his actions, sometimes different members of the same family were split by being classified as \"white\" or \"colored\". He did not allow people to enter their primary identification as Native American in state records.<ref name=\"home.hamptonroads.com\">{{cite web |url=http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=74481&ran=162825 |website=Pilotonline.com |title=The black-and-white world of Walter Ashby Plecker |accessdate=February 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103123937/http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=74481&ran=162825 |archivedate=January 3, 2006 |df= }}</ref> In 2009, the [[Senate Indian Affairs Committee]] endorsed a bill that would grant federal recognition to tribes in Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/state_regional_govtpolitics/article/INDI23_20091022-223007/301146//|title = Virginia tribes take another step on road to federal recognition|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://archive.today/20091026175747/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/state_regional_govtpolitics/article/INDI23_20091022-223007/301146/|archivedate = October 26, 2009|date = October 23, 2009|website = Richmond Times-Dispatch|df = }}</ref>\n\nTo achieve federal recognition and its benefits, tribes must prove continuous existence since 1900.

Watercolor by John White, 1585]]\nNative Americans have been depicted by [[List of American artists|American artists]] in various ways at different periods. A number of 19th- and 20th-century United States and Canadian painters, often motivated by a desire to document and preserve Native culture, specialized in Native American subjects. Among the most prominent of these were [[Elbridge Ayer Burbank]], [[George Catlin]], [[Seth and Mary Eastman|Seth Eastman]], [[Paul Kane]], [[W. Langdon Kihn]], [[Charles Bird King]], [[Joseph Henry Sharp]], and [[John Mix Stanley]].\n\nIn the 20th century, early portrayals of Native Americans in [[movies]] and [[television]] roles were first performed by European Americans dressed in mock traditional attire. Examples included ''The Last of the Mohicans'' (1920), ''Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans'' (1957), and ''[[F Troop]]'' (1965\u201367). In later decades, Native American actors such as [[Jay Silverheels]] in ''[[The Lone Ranger#Television series|The Lone Ranger]]'' television series (1949\u201357) came to prominence. Roles of Native Americans were limited and not reflective of Native American culture. By the 1970s some Native American film roles began to show more complexity, such as those in ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), which depicted Native Americans in minor supporting roles.\n\nFor years, Native people on U.S. television were relegated to secondary, subordinate roles. During the years of the series ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959\u20131973), no major or secondary Native characters appeared on a consistent basis. The series ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949\u20131957), ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1955\u20131963), and ''[[Law of the Plainsman]]'' (1959\u20131963) had Native characters who were essentially aides to the central white characters. This continued in such series as ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)|How the West Was Won]]''. These programs resembled the \"sympathetic\" yet contradictory film ''[[Dances With Wolves]]'' of 1990, in which, according to Ella Shohat and Robert Stam, the narrative choice was to relate the Lakota story as told through a Euro-American voice, for wider impact among a general audience.<ref>Shohat, Ella, and Stam, Robert. ''Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media''. New York: Routledge, 1994.</ref>\nLike the 1992 remake of ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'' and ''[[Geronimo: An American Legend]]'' (1993), ''Dances with Wolves'' employed a number of Native American actors, and made an effort to portray Indigenous languages.\n\nIn 2009 ''[[We Shall Remain (documentary)|We Shall Remain]]'' (2009), a television documentary by [[Ric Burns]] and part of the ''[[American Experience]]'' series, presented a five-episode series \"from a Native American perspective\". It represented \"an unprecedented collaboration between Native and non-Native filmmakers and involves Native advisors and scholars at all levels of the project\".<ref>{{Cite news |title=About the Project: We Shall Remain|url =https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/weshallremain/the_films/about |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> The five episodes explore the impact of [[King Philip's War]] on the northeastern tribes, the \"Native American confederacy\" of [[Tecumseh's War]], the U.S.-forced relocation of Southeastern tribes known as the [[Trail of Tears]], the pursuit and capture of [[Geronimo]] and the [[Apache Wars]], and concludes with the [[Wounded Knee incident]], participation by the [[American Indian Movement]], and the increasing resurgence of modern Native cultures since.\n\n===Terminology differences===\n{{further|Native American name controversy}}\n\n====Common usage in the United States====\nNative Americans are often known as Indians or American Indians. The term ''Native American'' was introduced in the United States in preference to the older term ''Indian'' to distinguish the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] from the people of [[India]] and to avoid negative stereotypes associated with the term ''Indian''. In 1995, a plurality of indigenous Americans, however, preferred the term ''American Indian''<ref name=\"Census\">{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762158.html |website=Infoplease |title=Preference for Racial or Ethnic Terminology |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> and many [[List of federally recognized tribes|tribes]] include the word Indian in their formal title.\n\nCriticism of the [[neologism]] ''Native American'' comes from diverse sources. [[Russell Means]], an American Indian activist, opposed the term ''Native American'' because he believed it was imposed by the government without the consent of American Indians. He has also argued that the use of the word ''Indian'' derives not from a confusion with India but from a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] expression ''en Dios'' meaning \"in God\"<ref>Russell Means: \"I am an American Indian, not a native American!\" (Treaty Productions, 1996); citation given here [http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nc-american-indians/5526] and here [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/fts/bismarck_200504A16.html] and they cover the general subject and some Means' contribution, but have no reference to \"En Di\u00f3s\" and only those non-working links to text.</ref>{{verify source|date=June 2018}} (and a near-[[homophone]] of the Spanish word for \"Indians\", ''indios'').\n\nA 1995 U.S. Census Bureau survey found that more Native Americans in the United States preferred ''American Indian'' to ''Native American''.<ref name=\"Census\" /> Most American Indians are comfortable with ''Indian'', ''American Indian'', and ''Native American'', and the terms are often used interchangeably.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/aihmterms.html |website=Infoplease |title=''American Indian'' versus ''Native American'' |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> The traditional term is reflected in the name chosen for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], which opened in 2004 on [[The Mall (Washington, DC)|the Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\n===Gambling industry===\n[[File:Sandia Casino, detail.jpg|thumb|Sandia Casino, owned by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] of [[New Mexico]]]]\n{{Main|Native American gaming}}\n[[Gambling]] has become a leading industry.

Some tribes, such as the [[Winnemem Wintu]] of [[Redding, California]], feel that casinos and their proceeds destroy culture from the inside out. These tribes refuse to participate in the gambling industry.\n\n===Financial services===\nNumerous tribes around the country have entered the financial services market including the [[Otoe-Missouria]], [[Tunica-Biloxi]], and the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation|Rosebud Sioux]]. Because of the challenges involved in starting a financial services business from scratch, many tribes hire outside consultants and vendors to help them launch these businesses and manage the regulatory issues involved.\nSimilar to the tribal sovereignty debates that occurred when tribes first entered the gaming industry, the tribes, states, and federal government are currently in disagreement regarding who possesses the authority to regulate these e-commerce business entities.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Online Sovereignty: The Law and Economics of Tribal Electronic Commerce|ssrn=2740181|journal=Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment & Technology Law|date=March 2016|last1=Claw|first1=Carma|last2=Spilde|first2=Katherine A.|author2-link=Katherine Spilde|last3=Clarkson|first3=Esq}}</ref>\n\n===Crime on reservations===\nProsecution of serious crime, historically endemic on reservations,<ref name=DOJStat>{{cite web|title=A BJS Statistical Profile, 1992\u20132002 American Indians and Crime|url=http://www.justice.gov/otj/pdf/american_indians_and_crime.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs|accessdate=June 2, 2012|author=Steven W.

Fractionalization occurs when a landowner dies, and their land is inherited by their children, but not subdivided. This means that one parcel might be owned by 50 different individuals. A majority of those holding interest must agree to any proposal to develop the land, and establishing this consent is time-consuming, cumbersome, and sometimes impossible.\nAnother landownership issue on reservations is checkerboarding, where Tribal land is interspersed with land owned by the federal government on behalf of Native's, individually owned plots, and land owned by non-Native individuals. This prevents Tribal governments to secure plots of land large enough for economic development or agricultural uses.<ref>https://www.frbsf.org/community-development/files/Community-Investments-Fall-2013-Native-Communities.pdf</ref>\nBecause reservation land is owned \u201cin trust\u201d by the federal government, individuals living on reservations cannot build equity in their homes. This bars Native Americans from getting a loan, as there is nothing that a bank can collect if the loan is not paid. Past efforts to encourage landownership (such as the Dawes Act) resulted in a net loss of Tribal land. After they were familiarized with their [[Smallholding|smallholder status]], Native American landowners were lifted of trust restrictions and their land would get transferred back to them, contingent of a transactional fee to the federal government. The transfer fee discouraged Native American land ownership, with 65% of tribal owned land being sold to non-Native Americans by the 1920s.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Van Winkle|first=Tony N.|date=Fall 2018|title=American Indian Landowners, Leasemen, and Bureaucrats: Property, Paper, and the Poli-Technics of Dispossession in Southwestern Oklahoma|url=|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=42|issue=4|pages=508\u2013533|doi=10.5250/amerindiquar.42.4.0508}}</ref> Activists against property rights point to historical evidence of communal ownership of land and resources by tribes.

The '''Columbian exchange''', also known as the '''Columbian interchange''', was the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the [[Americas]] and the [[Old World]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, following [[Christopher Columbus]]'s [[voyages of Christopher Columbus#First voyage|1492 voyage]].<ref name = \"history\">{{cite journal |last1= Nunn |first1= Nathan |last2= Qian |first2= Nancy |year= 2010 |title= The Columbian Exchange: A History of Disease, Food, and Ideas |journal= [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume= 24 |issue= 2 |pages= 163\u2013188 |jstor= 25703506 |doi= 10.1257/jep.24.2.163 |url= http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:11986330 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.232.9242 }}</ref> The Columbian exchange generally had a destructive impact on Native American culture through disease, and a 'clash of cultures',<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800.\" European Review 11, no. 1.

Feb. 2003. p. 46</ref>\n\nThe impact of the Columbian exchange was not entirely negative however. For example, the re-introduction of the horse to North America allowed the [[Plains Indian]] to revolutionize their way of life by making hunting, trading, and warfare far more effective, and to greatly improve their ability to transport possessions and move their settlements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.na.038|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains \u2013 HORSE|website=plainshumanities.unl.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe Great Plains tribes were still hunting the bison when they first encountered the Europeans. The Spanish reintroduction of the horse to North America in the 17th century and Native Americans' learning to use them greatly altered the Native Americans' culture, including changing the way in which they hunted large game. Horses became such a valuable, central element of Native lives that they were counted as a measure of wealth.\n\nIn the early years, as these native peoples encountered European explorers and settlers and engaged in trade, they exchanged food, crafts, and furs for blankets, iron and steel implements, horses, trinkets, firearms, and alcoholic beverages.\n\n===Ethno-linguistic classification===\n[[File:Langs N.Amer.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Pre-contact: distribution of North American language families, including northern Mexico]]\n{{Main|Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous languages of the Americas|}}\n\nThe [[Na-Den\u00e9 languages|Na-Den\u00e9]], [[Algic languages|Algic]], and [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] families are the largest in terms of number of languages.

Na-Den\u00e9 and Algic have the widest geographic distributions: Algic currently spans from northeastern Canada across much of the continent down to northeastern Mexico (due to later migrations of the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]]) with two outliers in [[California]] ([[Yurok language|Yurok]] and [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]]); Na-Den\u00e9 spans from Alaska and western Canada through [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and California to the [[Southwestern United States|U.S. Southwest]] and northern Mexico (with one outlier in the Plains). Several families consist of only 2 or 3 languages. Demonstrating genetic relationships has proved difficult due to the great linguistic diversity present in North America.

[[Native American flute|Flutes]] and whistles made of wood, cane, or bone are also played, generally by individuals, but in former times also by large ensembles (as noted by Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|de Soto]]).

Drum groups play in unison while they sing in a native language and dancers in colorful regalia dance clockwise around the drum groups in the center. Familiar pow-wow songs include honor songs, intertribal songs, crow-hops, sneak-up songs, grass-dances, two-steps, welcome songs, going-home songs, and war songs.

Native Americans began selling war captives to Europeans rather than integrating them into their own societies as they had done before. As the demand for labor in the [[West Indies]] grew with the cultivation of [[sugar cane]], Europeans enslaved Native Americans for the [[Thirteen Colonies]], and some were exported to the \"sugar islands\". The British settlers, especially those in the southern colonies, purchased or captured Native Americans to use as forced labor in cultivating tobacco, rice, and indigo.

It gave rise to a series of devastating wars among the tribes, including the [[Yamasee War]]. The [[Indian Wars]] of the early 18th century, combined with the increasing importation of African slaves, effectively ended the Native American slave trade by 1750. Colonists found that Native American slaves could easily escape, as they knew the country. The wars cost the lives of numerous colonial slave traders and disrupted their early societies. The remaining Native American groups banded together to face the Europeans from a position of strength. Many surviving Native American peoples of the southeast strengthened their loose coalitions of language groups and joined confederacies such as the [[Choctaw]], the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]], and the [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]] for protection.

A greater percentage could have a smaller proportion of Indian ancestry, but their conclusions show that popular estimates of Native American admixture may have been too high.<ref>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., ''In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past'', New York: Crown Publishers, 2009, pp. 20\u201321.</ref> More recent genetic testing research of 2015, have found varied ancestries which show different tendencies by region and sex of ancestors.

For instance, federal scholarships for Native Americans require the student both to be enrolled in a federally recognized tribe ''and'' to be of at least one-quarter Native American descent (equivalent to one grandparent), attested to by a [[Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood]] (CDIB) card issued by the federal government.\n\nSome tribes have begun requiring [[genealogical DNA test]]ing of individuals' applying for membership, but this is usually related to an individual's proving parentage or direct descent from a certified member.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Karen |title=Ancestry in a Drop of Blood |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/30/science/sci-indiandna30 |accessdate=October 17, 2018 |work=LA TImes |date=August 30, 2005}}</ref> Requirements for tribal membership vary widely by tribe. The Cherokee require documented direct genealogical descent from a Native American listed on the early 1906 [[Dawes Rolls]]. Tribal rules regarding recognition of members who have heritage from multiple tribes are equally diverse and complex.\n\nTribal membership conflicts have led to a number of legal disputes, court cases, and the formation of activist groups. One example of this are the [[Cherokee Freedmen]]. Today, they include descendants of African Americans once enslaved by the Cherokees, who were granted, by federal treaty, citizenship in the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|historic Cherokee Nation]] as freedmen after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The [[Cherokee Nation|modern Cherokee Nation]], in the early 1980s, passed a law to require that all members must prove descent from a Cherokee Native American (not Cherokee Freedmen) listed on the Dawes Rolls, resulting in the exclusion of some individuals and families who had been active in Cherokee culture for years.\n\n===Increased self-identification===\nSince the census of 2000, people may identify as being of more than one race.<ref name=\"2010 Census AMAN\" /> Since the 1960s, the number of people claiming Native American ancestry has grown significantly and by the 2000 census, the number had more than doubled. Sociologists attribute this dramatic change to \"ethnic shifting\" or \"ethnic shopping\"; they believe that it reflects a willingness of people to question their birth identities and adopt new ethnicities which they find more compatible.\n\nThe author [[Jack Hitt]] writes:\n\n{{quote|The reaction from lifelong Indians runs the gamut. It is easy to find Native Americans who denounce many of these new Indians as members of the wannabe tribe. But it is also easy to find Indians like Clem Iron Wing, an elder among the [[Lakota people|Lakota]], who sees this flood of new ethnic claims as magnificent, a surge of Indians 'trying to come home.' Those Indians who ridicule Iron Wing's lax sense of tribal membership have retrofitted the old genocidal system of blood quantum\u2014measuring racial purity by blood\u2014into the new standard for real Indianness, a choice rich with paradox.<ref name=\"Newest Indians\"/>}}\n\nThe journalist Mary Annette Pember notes that identifying with Native American culture may be a result of a person's increased interest in [[genealogy]], the romanticization of the lifestyle, and a family tradition of Native American ancestors in the distant past. There are different issues if a person wants to pursue enrollment as a member of a tribe. Different tribes have different requirements for tribal membership; in some cases persons are reluctant to enroll, seeing it as a method of control initiated by the federal government; and there are individuals who are 100% Native American but, because of their mixed tribal heritage, do not qualify to belong to any individual tribe. Pember concludes:\n\n{{quote|The subjects of genuine American Indian blood, cultural connection and recognition by the community are extremely contentious issues, hotly debated throughout Indian country and beyond.

The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the [[Indian Appropriations Act#1871|Indian Appropriations Act of 1871]] ended recognition of independent native nations, and started treating them as \"domestic dependent nations\" subject to federal law. This law did preserve the rights and privileges agreed to under the treaties, including a large degree of [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]]. For this reason, many (but not all) Native American reservations are still independent of state law and actions of tribal citizens on these reservations are subject only to tribal courts and federal law.\n\nThe [[Indian Citizenship Act]] of 1924 granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans born in the United States who had not yet obtained it. This emptied the \"Indians not taxed\" category established by the [[United States Constitution]], allowed natives to vote in state and federal elections, and extended the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] protections granted to people \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. However, some states continued to deny [[Native American civil rights#Voting|Native Americans voting rights]] for several decades. Bill of Rights protections do not apply to tribal governments, except for those mandated by the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\nSince the end of the 15th century, the [[migration of Europeans to the Americas]] has led to centuries of population, cultural, and agricultural transfer and adjustment between [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]] societies, a process known as the [[Columbian exchange]]. As most Native American groups had historically preserved their histories by [[oral tradition]]s and artwork, the first written sources of the conflict were written by Europeans.<ref name=\"test\">Calloway, Colin G.

The ten cultural areas are as follows:\n\n* [[Circumpolar peoples|Arctic]], including [[Aleut people|Aleut]], [[Inuit]], and [[Yupik peoples]]\n* [[Alaska natives|Subarctic]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeastern Woodlands]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands|Southeastern Woodlands]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains|Great Plains]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin|Great Basin]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau|Northwest Plateau]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Northwest Coast]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of California|California]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the North American Southwest|Southwest]] ([[Oasisamerica]])\n\nAt the time of the first contact, the indigenous cultures were quite different from those of the proto-industrial and mostly [[Christianity|Christian]] immigrants. Some Northeastern and Southwestern cultures, in particular, were [[matrilineal]] and operated on a more collective basis than that with which Europeans were familiar. The majority of indigenous American tribes maintained their hunting grounds and agricultural lands for use of the entire tribe. Europeans at that time had [[patriarchal]] cultures and had developed concepts of individual [[property rights]] with respect to land that were extremely different. The differences in cultures between the established Native Americans and immigrant Europeans, as well as shifting alliances among different nations in times of war, caused extensive political tension, ethnic violence, and social disruption.\n\nEven before the European settlement of what is now the United States, Native Americans suffered high fatalities from [[Native American disease and epidemics|contact with new European diseases]], to which they had not yet acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]; the diseases were endemic to the Spanish and other Europeans, and spread by direct contact and likely through pigs that escaped from expeditions.<ref name=\"mann\"/> [[Smallpox epidemics in the Americas|Smallpox epidemics]] are thought to have caused the greatest loss of life for indigenous populations.

Native Americans believed this forced relocation illegal, given the [[Treaty of Hopewell]] of 1785. Under President [[Andrew Jackson]], [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830, which authorized the President to conduct treaties to exchange Native American land east of the [[Mississippi River]] for lands west of the river.\n\nAs many as 100,000 Native Americans relocated to the West as a result of this [[Indian removal]] policy. In theory, relocation was supposed to be voluntary and many Native Americans did remain in the East. In practice, great pressure was put on Native American leaders to sign removal treaties. The most egregious violation, the [[Trail of Tears]], was the removal of the Cherokee by [[Andrew Jackson|President Jackson]] to [[Indian Territory]].<ref>Carter (III), Samuel (1976).

Under the leadership of [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]] the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) brought in progressive educators to reshape Indian education. The BIA by 1938 taught 30,000 students in 377 boarding and day schools, or 40% of all Indian children in school. The [[Navajo]] largely opposed schooling of any sort, but the other tribes accepted the system.

The resulting increase in contact with the world outside of the reservation system brought profound changes to Native American culture. \"The war\", said the U.S. Indian Commissioner in 1945, \"caused the greatest disruption of Native life since the beginning of the reservation era\", affecting the habits, views, and economic well-being of tribal members.<ref>Bernstein, p. 131</ref> The most significant of these changes was the opportunity\u2014as a result of wartime labor shortages\u2014to find well-paying work in cities, and many people relocated to urban areas, particularly on the West Coast with the buildup of the defense industry.\n\nThere were also losses as a result of the war. For instance, a total of 1,200 [[Pueblo Indians|Pueblo]] men served in World War II; only about half came home alive. In addition, many more [[Navajo people|Navajo]] served as [[code talker]]s for the military in the Pacific. The code they made, although [[cryptology|cryptologically]] very simple, was never cracked by the Japanese.\n\n====Self-determination====\n{{main|Native American self-determination|Native American civil rights}}\n\nMilitary service and urban residency contributed to the rise of American Indian activism, particularly after the 1960s and the [[occupation of Alcatraz Island]] (1969\u20131971) by a student Indian group from [[San Francisco]]. In the same period, the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) was founded in [[Minneapolis]], and chapters were established throughout the country, where American Indians combined spiritual and political activism. Political protests gained national media attention and the sympathy of the American public.\n\nThrough the mid-1970s, conflicts between governments and Native Americans occasionally erupted into violence. A notable late 20th-century event was the [[Wounded Knee incident]] on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]]. Upset with tribal government and the failures of the federal government to enforce treaty rights, about 300 [[Oglala Lakota]] and AIM activists took control of [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota|Wounded Knee]] on February 27, 1973.<ref name=\"Waldron\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/28/archives/shot-kills-indian-at-wounded-knee-another-insurgent-is-hurt-during.html |title=Shot Kills Indian At Wounded Knee |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date= April 28, 1973|accessdate=August 22, 2010|first=Martin|last=Waldron}}</ref>\n\nIndian activists from around the country joined them at Pine Ridge, and the occupation became a symbol of rising American Indian identity and power. Federal law enforcement officials and the national guard cordoned off the town, and the two sides had a standoff for 71 days. During much gunfire, one [[United States Marshal]] was wounded and paralyzed. In late April, a Cherokee and local Lakota man were killed by gunfire; the Lakota elders ended the occupation to ensure no more lives were lost.<ref name=\"Waldron\"/>\n\nIn June 1975, two FBI agents seeking to make an armed robbery arrest at Pine Ridge Reservation were wounded in a firefight, and killed at close range. The AIM activist [[Leonard Peltier]] was sentenced in 1976 to two consecutive terms of life in prison in the FBI deaths.<ref>{{cite news |last=Crosson |first=Judith |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/11/05/appeals_court_denies_peltiers_parole_bid/ |title=Appeals court denies Peltier's parole bid |publisher=Boston.com |date=November 5, 2003 |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, the government enacted the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968|Indian Civil Rights Act]]. This gave tribal members most of the protections against abuses by tribal governments that the Bill of Rights accords to all U.S. citizens with respect to the federal government.<ref>Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 IDAHO LAW REVIEW 465 (1998).</ref> In 1975, the U.S. government passed the [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act]], marking the culmination of fifteen years of policy changes. It resulted from American Indian activism, the Civil Rights Movement, and community development aspects of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s social programs of the 1960s. The Act recognized the right and need of Native Americans for self-determination. It marked the U.S. government's turn away from the 1950s policy of termination of the relationship between tribes and the government. The U.S. government encouraged Native Americans' efforts at self-government and determining their futures. Tribes have developed organizations to administer their own social, welfare and housing programs, for instance. Tribal self-determination has created tension with respect to the federal government's historic trust obligation to care for Indians; however, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has never lived up to that responsibility.<ref>Robert J.

Tensions immediately arose between two philosophies: one that the tribal colleges should have the same criteria, curriculum and procedures for educational quality as mainstream colleges, the other that the faculty and curriculum should be closely adapted to the particular historical culture of the tribe. There was a great deal of turnover, exacerbated by very tight budgets.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gregory | first1 = T. | last2 = Thaxton | first2 = Lourene | year = 2007 | title = Robert A.

Thirty-two tribal colleges in the United States belong to the [[American Indian Higher Education Consortium]]. By the early 21st century, tribal nations had also established numerous language revival programs in their schools.\n\nIn addition, Native American activism has led major universities across the country to establish [[Native American studies]] programs and departments, increasing awareness of the strengths of Indian cultures, providing opportunities for academics, and deepening research on history and cultures in the United States. Native Americans have entered academia; journalism and media; politics at local, state and federal levels; and public service, for instance, influencing medical research and policy to identify issues related to American Indians.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Byron Mallott inaugural speech.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byron Mallott]], an [[Alaska Native]], is the former [[Democratic party (U.S.)|Democratic]] lieutenant governor of [[Alaska]].]]\nIn 2009, an \"apology to Native Peoples of the United States\" was included in the Defense Appropriations Act.

Urban areas with significant Native American populations include Minneapolis, Denver, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Tucson, Chicago, Oklahoma City, Houston, New York City, Los Angeles, and Rapid City. Many lived in poverty. Racism, unemployment, drugs and gangs were common problems which Indian social service organizations such as the Little Earth housing complex in Minneapolis attempted to address.<ref name=NYT41413 /> Grassroots efforts to support urban Indigenous populations have also taken place, as in the case of [[Bringing the Circle Together]] in Los Angeles.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Further|Modern social statistics of Native Americans}}\n{{See also|Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n\nThe 2010 Census showed that the U.S. population on April 1, 2010, was 308.7 million.<ref name=\"2010 Census AMAN\" /> Out of the total U.S. population, 2.9 million people, or 0.9 percent, reported American Indian or Alaska Native alone. In addition, 2.3 million people, or another 0.7 percent, reported American Indian or Alaska Native in combination with one or more other races. Together, these two groups totaled 5.2 million people.

But gaining federal recognition as a tribe is extremely difficult; to be established as a tribal group, members have to submit extensive [[genealogy|genealogical]] proof of tribal descent and continuity of the tribe as a culture.\n\n[[File:Abandoned Mines Shiprock 2009.jpg|thumb|Native peoples are concerned about the effects of [[Uranium mining and the Navajo people|abandoned uranium mines]] on or near their lands.]]\nIn July 2000, the [[Washington State Republican Party]] adopted a resolution recommending that the federal and legislative branches of the [[U.S. government]] terminate tribal governments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiancountry.com/articles/headline-2000-07-12-01.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000902214724/http://www.indiancountry.com/articles/headline-2000-07-12-01.shtml |archivedate=September 2, 2000 |title=Washington GOP plank to terminate tribes ignites firestorm |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> In 2007, a group of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] congressmen and congresswomen introduced a bill in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] to \"terminate\" the [[Cherokee Nation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tanasijournal.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=365&Itemid=1&ed=53 |title=National Congress of American Indians Opposes Bill to Terminate the Cherokee Nation |date=July 7, 2007 |website=Tanasi Journal |publisher=Wisdom Keepers, Inc. |accessdate=November 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510034518/http://www.tanasijournal.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=365&Itemid=1&ed=53 |archivedate=May 10, 2009 }}</ref> This was related to their voting to exclude Cherokee Freedmen as members of the tribe unless they had a Cherokee ancestor on the Dawes Rolls, although all Cherokee Freedmen and their descendants had been members since 1866.\n\nAs of 2004, various Native Americans are wary of attempts by others to gain control of their reservation lands for natural resources, such as [[coal]] and [[uranium]] in the West.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/band/senaaeurope/DRelocation.html |website=Senaa |title=The Genocide and Relocation of the Dine'h (Navajo) |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://lists.wayne.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9703&L=tamha&F=&S=&P=7661 |website=LISTSERV at Wayne State University|title=Big Mountain Update 1 February 1997 |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn the state of [[Virginia]], Native Americans face a unique problem. Until 2017 Virginia previously had no federally recognized tribes but the state had recognized eight. This is related historically to the greater impact of disease and warfare on the Virginia Indian populations, as well as their intermarriage with Europeans and Africans. Some people confused the ancestry with culture, but groups of Virginia Indians maintained their cultural continuity. Most of their early reservations were ended under the pressure of early European settlement.\n\nSome historians also note the problems of Virginia Indians in establishing documented continuity of identity, due to the work of [[Walter Ashby Plecker]] (1912\u20131946). As registrar of the state's Bureau of Vital Statistics, he applied his own interpretation of the [[one-drop rule]], enacted in law in 1924 as the state's Racial Integrity Act. It recognized only two races: \"white\" and \"colored\".\n\nPlecker, a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregationist]], believed that the state's Native Americans had been \"mongrelized\" by intermarriage with [[African American]]s; to him, ancestry determined identity, rather than culture. He thought that some people of partial black ancestry were trying to \"[[passing (racial identity)|pass]]\" as Native Americans. Plecker thought that anyone with any African heritage had to be classified as colored, regardless of appearance, amount of European or Native American ancestry, and cultural/community identification. Plecker pressured local governments into reclassifying all Native Americans in the state as \"colored\", and gave them lists of family surnames to examine for reclassification based on his interpretation of data and the law. This led to the state's destruction of accurate records related to families and communities who identified as Native American (as in church records and daily life). By his actions, sometimes different members of the same family were split by being classified as \"white\" or \"colored\". He did not allow people to enter their primary identification as Native American in state records.<ref name=\"home.hamptonroads.com\">{{cite web |url=http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=74481&ran=162825 |website=Pilotonline.com |title=The black-and-white world of Walter Ashby Plecker |accessdate=February 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103123937/http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=74481&ran=162825 |archivedate=January 3, 2006 |df= }}</ref> In 2009, the [[Senate Indian Affairs Committee]] endorsed a bill that would grant federal recognition to tribes in Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/state_regional_govtpolitics/article/INDI23_20091022-223007/301146//|title = Virginia tribes take another step on road to federal recognition|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://archive.today/20091026175747/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/state_regional_govtpolitics/article/INDI23_20091022-223007/301146/|archivedate = October 26, 2009|date = October 23, 2009|website = Richmond Times-Dispatch|df = }}</ref>\n\nTo achieve federal recognition and its benefits, tribes must prove continuous existence since 1900.

Watercolor by John White, 1585]]\nNative Americans have been depicted by [[List of American artists|American artists]] in various ways at different periods. A number of 19th- and 20th-century United States and Canadian painters, often motivated by a desire to document and preserve Native culture, specialized in Native American subjects. Among the most prominent of these were [[Elbridge Ayer Burbank]], [[George Catlin]], [[Seth and Mary Eastman|Seth Eastman]], [[Paul Kane]], [[W. Langdon Kihn]], [[Charles Bird King]], [[Joseph Henry Sharp]], and [[John Mix Stanley]].\n\nIn the 20th century, early portrayals of Native Americans in [[movies]] and [[television]] roles were first performed by European Americans dressed in mock traditional attire. Examples included ''The Last of the Mohicans'' (1920), ''Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans'' (1957), and ''[[F Troop]]'' (1965\u201367). In later decades, Native American actors such as [[Jay Silverheels]] in ''[[The Lone Ranger#Television series|The Lone Ranger]]'' television series (1949\u201357) came to prominence. Roles of Native Americans were limited and not reflective of Native American culture. By the 1970s some Native American film roles began to show more complexity, such as those in ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), which depicted Native Americans in minor supporting roles.\n\nFor years, Native people on U.S. television were relegated to secondary, subordinate roles. During the years of the series ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959\u20131973), no major or secondary Native characters appeared on a consistent basis. The series ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949\u20131957), ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1955\u20131963), and ''[[Law of the Plainsman]]'' (1959\u20131963) had Native characters who were essentially aides to the central white characters. This continued in such series as ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)|How the West Was Won]]''. These programs resembled the \"sympathetic\" yet contradictory film ''[[Dances With Wolves]]'' of 1990, in which, according to Ella Shohat and Robert Stam, the narrative choice was to relate the Lakota story as told through a Euro-American voice, for wider impact among a general audience.<ref>Shohat, Ella, and Stam, Robert. ''Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media''. New York: Routledge, 1994.</ref>\nLike the 1992 remake of ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'' and ''[[Geronimo: An American Legend]]'' (1993), ''Dances with Wolves'' employed a number of Native American actors, and made an effort to portray Indigenous languages.\n\nIn 2009 ''[[We Shall Remain (documentary)|We Shall Remain]]'' (2009), a television documentary by [[Ric Burns]] and part of the ''[[American Experience]]'' series, presented a five-episode series \"from a Native American perspective\". It represented \"an unprecedented collaboration between Native and non-Native filmmakers and involves Native advisors and scholars at all levels of the project\".<ref>{{Cite news |title=About the Project: We Shall Remain|url =https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/weshallremain/the_films/about |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> The five episodes explore the impact of [[King Philip's War]] on the northeastern tribes, the \"Native American confederacy\" of [[Tecumseh's War]], the U.S.-forced relocation of Southeastern tribes known as the [[Trail of Tears]], the pursuit and capture of [[Geronimo]] and the [[Apache Wars]], and concludes with the [[Wounded Knee incident]], participation by the [[American Indian Movement]], and the increasing resurgence of modern Native cultures since.\n\n===Terminology differences===\n{{further|Native American name controversy}}\n\n====Common usage in the United States====\nNative Americans are often known as Indians or American Indians. The term ''Native American'' was introduced in the United States in preference to the older term ''Indian'' to distinguish the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] from the people of [[India]] and to avoid negative stereotypes associated with the term ''Indian''. In 1995, a plurality of indigenous Americans, however, preferred the term ''American Indian''<ref name=\"Census\">{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762158.html |website=Infoplease |title=Preference for Racial or Ethnic Terminology |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> and many [[List of federally recognized tribes|tribes]] include the word Indian in their formal title.\n\nCriticism of the [[neologism]] ''Native American'' comes from diverse sources. [[Russell Means]], an American Indian activist, opposed the term ''Native American'' because he believed it was imposed by the government without the consent of American Indians. He has also argued that the use of the word ''Indian'' derives not from a confusion with India but from a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] expression ''en Dios'' meaning \"in God\"<ref>Russell Means: \"I am an American Indian, not a native American!\" (Treaty Productions, 1996); citation given here [http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nc-american-indians/5526] and here [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/fts/bismarck_200504A16.html] and they cover the general subject and some Means' contribution, but have no reference to \"En Di\u00f3s\" and only those non-working links to text.</ref>{{verify source|date=June 2018}} (and a near-[[homophone]] of the Spanish word for \"Indians\", ''indios'').\n\nA 1995 U.S. Census Bureau survey found that more Native Americans in the United States preferred ''American Indian'' to ''Native American''.<ref name=\"Census\" /> Most American Indians are comfortable with ''Indian'', ''American Indian'', and ''Native American'', and the terms are often used interchangeably.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/aihmterms.html |website=Infoplease |title=''American Indian'' versus ''Native American'' |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> The traditional term is reflected in the name chosen for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], which opened in 2004 on [[The Mall (Washington, DC)|the Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\n===Gambling industry===\n[[File:Sandia Casino, detail.jpg|thumb|Sandia Casino, owned by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] of [[New Mexico]]]]\n{{Main|Native American gaming}}\n[[Gambling]] has become a leading industry.

Some tribes, such as the [[Winnemem Wintu]] of [[Redding, California]], feel that casinos and their proceeds destroy culture from the inside out. These tribes refuse to participate in the gambling industry.\n\n===Financial services===\nNumerous tribes around the country have entered the financial services market including the [[Otoe-Missouria]], [[Tunica-Biloxi]], and the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation|Rosebud Sioux]]. Because of the challenges involved in starting a financial services business from scratch, many tribes hire outside consultants and vendors to help them launch these businesses and manage the regulatory issues involved.\nSimilar to the tribal sovereignty debates that occurred when tribes first entered the gaming industry, the tribes, states, and federal government are currently in disagreement regarding who possesses the authority to regulate these e-commerce business entities.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Online Sovereignty: The Law and Economics of Tribal Electronic Commerce|ssrn=2740181|journal=Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment & Technology Law|date=March 2016|last1=Claw|first1=Carma|last2=Spilde|first2=Katherine A.|author2-link=Katherine Spilde|last3=Clarkson|first3=Esq}}</ref>\n\n===Crime on reservations===\nProsecution of serious crime, historically endemic on reservations,<ref name=DOJStat>{{cite web|title=A BJS Statistical Profile, 1992\u20132002 American Indians and Crime|url=http://www.justice.gov/otj/pdf/american_indians_and_crime.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs|accessdate=June 2, 2012|author=Steven W.

Fractionalization occurs when a landowner dies, and their land is inherited by their children, but not subdivided. This means that one parcel might be owned by 50 different individuals. A majority of those holding interest must agree to any proposal to develop the land, and establishing this consent is time-consuming, cumbersome, and sometimes impossible.\nAnother landownership issue on reservations is checkerboarding, where Tribal land is interspersed with land owned by the federal government on behalf of Native's, individually owned plots, and land owned by non-Native individuals. This prevents Tribal governments to secure plots of land large enough for economic development or agricultural uses.<ref>https://www.frbsf.org/community-development/files/Community-Investments-Fall-2013-Native-Communities.pdf</ref>\nBecause reservation land is owned \u201cin trust\u201d by the federal government, individuals living on reservations cannot build equity in their homes. This bars Native Americans from getting a loan, as there is nothing that a bank can collect if the loan is not paid. Past efforts to encourage landownership (such as the Dawes Act) resulted in a net loss of Tribal land. After they were familiarized with their [[Smallholding|smallholder status]], Native American landowners were lifted of trust restrictions and their land would get transferred back to them, contingent of a transactional fee to the federal government. The transfer fee discouraged Native American land ownership, with 65% of tribal owned land being sold to non-Native Americans by the 1920s.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Van Winkle|first=Tony N.|date=Fall 2018|title=American Indian Landowners, Leasemen, and Bureaucrats: Property, Paper, and the Poli-Technics of Dispossession in Southwestern Oklahoma|url=|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=42|issue=4|pages=508\u2013533|doi=10.5250/amerindiquar.42.4.0508}}</ref> Activists against property rights point to historical evidence of communal ownership of land and resources by tribes.

The '''Columbian exchange''', also known as the '''Columbian interchange''', was the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the [[Americas]] and the [[Old World]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, following [[Christopher Columbus]]'s [[voyages of Christopher Columbus#First voyage|1492 voyage]].<ref name = \"history\">{{cite journal |last1= Nunn |first1= Nathan |last2= Qian |first2= Nancy |year= 2010 |title= The Columbian Exchange: A History of Disease, Food, and Ideas |journal= [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume= 24 |issue= 2 |pages= 163\u2013188 |jstor= 25703506 |doi= 10.1257/jep.24.2.163 |url= http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:11986330 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.232.9242 }}</ref> The Columbian exchange generally had a destructive impact on Native American culture through disease, and a 'clash of cultures',<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800.\" European Review 11, no. 1.

Feb. 2003. p. 46</ref>\n\nThe impact of the Columbian exchange was not entirely negative however. For example, the re-introduction of the horse to North America allowed the [[Plains Indian]] to revolutionize their way of life by making hunting, trading, and warfare far more effective, and to greatly improve their ability to transport possessions and move their settlements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.na.038|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains \u2013 HORSE|website=plainshumanities.unl.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe Great Plains tribes were still hunting the bison when they first encountered the Europeans. The Spanish reintroduction of the horse to North America in the 17th century and Native Americans' learning to use them greatly altered the Native Americans' culture, including changing the way in which they hunted large game. Horses became such a valuable, central element of Native lives that they were counted as a measure of wealth.\n\nIn the early years, as these native peoples encountered European explorers and settlers and engaged in trade, they exchanged food, crafts, and furs for blankets, iron and steel implements, horses, trinkets, firearms, and alcoholic beverages.\n\n===Ethno-linguistic classification===\n[[File:Langs N.Amer.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Pre-contact: distribution of North American language families, including northern Mexico]]\n{{Main|Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous languages of the Americas|}}\n\nThe [[Na-Den\u00e9 languages|Na-Den\u00e9]], [[Algic languages|Algic]], and [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] families are the largest in terms of number of languages.

Na-Den\u00e9 and Algic have the widest geographic distributions: Algic currently spans from northeastern Canada across much of the continent down to northeastern Mexico (due to later migrations of the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]]) with two outliers in [[California]] ([[Yurok language|Yurok]] and [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]]); Na-Den\u00e9 spans from Alaska and western Canada through [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and California to the [[Southwestern United States|U.S. Southwest]] and northern Mexico (with one outlier in the Plains). Several families consist of only 2 or 3 languages. Demonstrating genetic relationships has proved difficult due to the great linguistic diversity present in North America.

[[Native American flute|Flutes]] and whistles made of wood, cane, or bone are also played, generally by individuals, but in former times also by large ensembles (as noted by Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|de Soto]]).

Drum groups play in unison while they sing in a native language and dancers in colorful regalia dance clockwise around the drum groups in the center. Familiar pow-wow songs include honor songs, intertribal songs, crow-hops, sneak-up songs, grass-dances, two-steps, welcome songs, going-home songs, and war songs.

Native Americans began selling war captives to Europeans rather than integrating them into their own societies as they had done before. As the demand for labor in the [[West Indies]] grew with the cultivation of [[sugar cane]], Europeans enslaved Native Americans for the [[Thirteen Colonies]], and some were exported to the \"sugar islands\". The British settlers, especially those in the southern colonies, purchased or captured Native Americans to use as forced labor in cultivating tobacco, rice, and indigo.

It gave rise to a series of devastating wars among the tribes, including the [[Yamasee War]]. The [[Indian Wars]] of the early 18th century, combined with the increasing importation of African slaves, effectively ended the Native American slave trade by 1750. Colonists found that Native American slaves could easily escape, as they knew the country. The wars cost the lives of numerous colonial slave traders and disrupted their early societies. The remaining Native American groups banded together to face the Europeans from a position of strength. Many surviving Native American peoples of the southeast strengthened their loose coalitions of language groups and joined confederacies such as the [[Choctaw]], the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]], and the [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]] for protection.

A greater percentage could have a smaller proportion of Indian ancestry, but their conclusions show that popular estimates of Native American admixture may have been too high.<ref>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., ''In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past'', New York: Crown Publishers, 2009, pp. 20\u201321.</ref> More recent genetic testing research of 2015, have found varied ancestries which show different tendencies by region and sex of ancestors.

For instance, federal scholarships for Native Americans require the student both to be enrolled in a federally recognized tribe ''and'' to be of at least one-quarter Native American descent (equivalent to one grandparent), attested to by a [[Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood]] (CDIB) card issued by the federal government.\n\nSome tribes have begun requiring [[genealogical DNA test]]ing of individuals' applying for membership, but this is usually related to an individual's proving parentage or direct descent from a certified member.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Karen |title=Ancestry in a Drop of Blood |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/30/science/sci-indiandna30 |accessdate=October 17, 2018 |work=LA TImes |date=August 30, 2005}}</ref> Requirements for tribal membership vary widely by tribe. The Cherokee require documented direct genealogical descent from a Native American listed on the early 1906 [[Dawes Rolls]]. Tribal rules regarding recognition of members who have heritage from multiple tribes are equally diverse and complex.\n\nTribal membership conflicts have led to a number of legal disputes, court cases, and the formation of activist groups. One example of this are the [[Cherokee Freedmen]]. Today, they include descendants of African Americans once enslaved by the Cherokees, who were granted, by federal treaty, citizenship in the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|historic Cherokee Nation]] as freedmen after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The [[Cherokee Nation|modern Cherokee Nation]], in the early 1980s, passed a law to require that all members must prove descent from a Cherokee Native American (not Cherokee Freedmen) listed on the Dawes Rolls, resulting in the exclusion of some individuals and families who had been active in Cherokee culture for years.\n\n===Increased self-identification===\nSince the census of 2000, people may identify as being of more than one race.<ref name=\"2010 Census AMAN\" /> Since the 1960s, the number of people claiming Native American ancestry has grown significantly and by the 2000 census, the number had more than doubled. Sociologists attribute this dramatic change to \"ethnic shifting\" or \"ethnic shopping\"; they believe that it reflects a willingness of people to question their birth identities and adopt new ethnicities which they find more compatible.\n\nThe author [[Jack Hitt]] writes:\n\n{{quote|The reaction from lifelong Indians runs the gamut. It is easy to find Native Americans who denounce many of these new Indians as members of the wannabe tribe. But it is also easy to find Indians like Clem Iron Wing, an elder among the [[Lakota people|Lakota]], who sees this flood of new ethnic claims as magnificent, a surge of Indians 'trying to come home.' Those Indians who ridicule Iron Wing's lax sense of tribal membership have retrofitted the old genocidal system of blood quantum\u2014measuring racial purity by blood\u2014into the new standard for real Indianness, a choice rich with paradox.<ref name=\"Newest Indians\"/>}}\n\nThe journalist Mary Annette Pember notes that identifying with Native American culture may be a result of a person's increased interest in [[genealogy]], the romanticization of the lifestyle, and a family tradition of Native American ancestors in the distant past. There are different issues if a person wants to pursue enrollment as a member of a tribe. Different tribes have different requirements for tribal membership; in some cases persons are reluctant to enroll, seeing it as a method of control initiated by the federal government; and there are individuals who are 100% Native American but, because of their mixed tribal heritage, do not qualify to belong to any individual tribe. Pember concludes:\n\n{{quote|The subjects of genuine American Indian blood, cultural connection and recognition by the community are extremely contentious issues, hotly debated throughout Indian country and beyond.

In the country there are 34 cities, of which 5 have population of over 50,000 and 12 towns with population of under 10,000 people. The capital city, [[Skopje]], is home to around 25% of the total population of the country. As of 2002, 59.5% of the population lived in urban areas.\nTwelve towns in North Macedonia have population under 10,000: [[Demir Hisar (town)|Demir Hisar]] (2,593), [[Peh\u010devo]] (3,237), [[Demir Kapija]] (3,275), [[Makedonski Brod]] (3,740), [[Valandovo]] (4,402), [[Makedonska Kamenica]] (5,147), [[Kru\u0161evo]] (5,330), [[Bogdanci]] (6,011), [[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]] (6,924), [[Berovo]] (7,002), [[Probi\u0161tip]] (8,714) and [[Resen (town)|Resen]] (8,748).

In the country there are 34 cities, of which 5 have population of over 50,000 and 12 towns with population of under 10,000 people. The capital city, [[Skopje]], is home to around 25% of the total population of the country. As of 2002, 59.5% of the population lived in urban areas.\nTwelve towns in North Macedonia have population under 10,000: [[Demir Hisar (town)|Demir Hisar]] (2,593), [[Peh\u010devo]] (3,237), [[Demir Kapija]] (3,275), [[Makedonski Brod]] (3,740), [[Valandovo]] (4,402), [[Makedonska Kamenica]] (5,147), [[Kru\u0161evo]] (5,330), [[Bogdanci]] (6,011), [[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]] (6,924), [[Berovo]] (7,002), [[Probi\u0161tip]] (8,714) and [[Resen (town)|Resen]] (8,748).
