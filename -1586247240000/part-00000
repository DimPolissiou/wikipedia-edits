The shield's five emblems represent ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]'', the five principles of Indonesia's national [[ideology]]. The Garuda claws gripping a white ribbon scroll inscribed with the national motto ''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]'' written in black text, which can be loosely translated as \"Unity in Diversity\". ''Garuda Pancasila'' was designed by [[Sultan Hamid II]] from [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]], supervised by [[Sukarno]], and was adopted as the national emblem on 11 February 1950.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Airlangga.jpg|thumb|left|upright|200px|Statue of King [[Airlangga]] depicted as [[Vishnu]] mounting Garuda.]]\n\n[[Garuda]], the discipled carrier or vehicle ([[vahana]]) of Lord [[Vishnu]], appears in many ancient [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples of ancient Indonesia. Temples such as [[Mendut]], [[Borobudur]], [[Sajiwan]], [[Prambanan]], [[Kidal Temple|Kidal]], [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], Belahan, and [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] depict the images (bas-relief or statue) of Garuda. In [[Prambanan]] temple complex there is a single temple located in front of [[Vishnu]] [[temple]], dedicated to Garuda. However, there is no statue of Garuda inside the chamber today. In the Shiva temple, also in [[Prambanan]] complex, there is a relief telling an episode of [[Ramayana]] about Garuda's nephew who also belongs to the bird-god race, [[Jatayu (Ramayana)|Jatayu]], tried to rescue [[Sita]] from [[Ravana]]'s hand. The deified statue of [[King]] [[Airlangga]] depicted as [[Vishnu]] mounting Garuda from Belahan, probably the most famous statue of [[Garuda]] from ancient Java. Now the statue is one of the important collection of [[Trowulan Museum]].\n\nGaruda appear in many traditions and stories, especially in [[Java]] and [[Bali]]. In many stories Garuda symbolises the virtue of knowledge, power, bravery, loyalty, and discipline. As the vehicle of Vishnu, Garuda also bears the attributes of Vishnu, which symbolise preservation of cosmic order. Balinese tradition venerated Garuda as \"the lord of all flying creatures\", and \"the majestic king of birds\". In Bali, Garuda traditionally portrayed as a divine creature with head, beak, wings, and claw of an eagle, while has the body of a human. Usually portrayed in intricate carving with golden and vivid colours, as the vehicle of Vishnu or in battle scene against [[N\u0101ga]] ([[dragon]]) [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]]. The important and noble position of Garuda in Indonesian tradition since ancient times has venerated Garuda as the national symbol of Indonesia, the embodiment of Indonesian ideology, ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]''. Garuda also chosen as the name of Indonesian national airlines, [[Garuda Indonesia]]. Next to Indonesia, [[Thailand]] also uses the Garuda as its [[Emblem of Thailand|national symbol]].\n\nAfter the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] ended and followed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] acknowledgement of the Indonesian independence in 1949, there is a need to create a [[national emblem]] of [[United States of Indonesia]]. On 10 January 1950 the Committee of State Seal was formed, under co-ordination of Sultan Hamid II of Pontianak as the State Minister of No [[Ministry (government department)|Portfolio]], with [[Muhammad Yamin]] as the chairman, and [[Ki Hajar Dewantara]], M. A. [[Melkias Agustinus Pellaupessy]], [[Mohammad Natsir]], and Raden Mas Ngabehi [[Poerbatjaraka]] as committee members. The committee task is to select the proposals of United States of Indonesia national emblem to be presented to the government.\n\n[[File:Proposed Republik Indonesia Serikat (United States of Indonesia) COA 4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The initial design of ''Garuda Pancasila'' design by Sultan Hamid II, still featuring an anthropomorphic Garuda.]]\n\nAccording to [[Mohammad Hatta]], in his memoire \"Bung Hatta Menjawab\", to fulfill the mandate of the Cabinet, Minister Priyono had launched the design competition. After the competition was held, there were two proposed designs selected as the finalist; one was the work of Sultan Hamid II and the other one was the work of Muhammad Yamin. In further process the design proposed by [[Sultan Hamid II]] was accepted by both [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (DPR) and the Government, while Yamin's design was rejected because featuring shining sun emblem that deemed clearly demonstrate the influence of [[Rising Sun Flag|Japanese Empire flag]]. Sukarno as The President of United States of Indonesia together with Mohammad Hatta as the Prime Minister, asked Sultan Hamid II to change the red and white ribbon being held by Garuda talons to white scroll bearing the national motto \"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\". On 8 February 1950, the design created by Sultan Hamid II was presented to President Sukarno. The design featuring Garuda in its [[anthropomorphic]] form, similar to traditional depiction of Garuda in ancient Javanese, Balinese, and Siamese art. However, the Islamic party [[Masyumi]] expressed their objection and stated that the bird with human neck and shoulders with both hands holding the ''Pancasila'' shield was too mythical.<ref name=\"tempointeraktif.com\">[http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/hukum/2010/01/27/brk,20100127-221646,id.html Lambang Garuda Pancasila Dirancang Seorang Sultan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809092108/http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/hukum/2010/01/27/brk,20100127-221646,id.html |date=9 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Winner Republik Indonesia Serikat (United States of Indonesia) COA 1950.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''Garuda Pancasila'' adopted on 11 February 1950, still without crest and with different position of talons.]]\n\nSultan Hamid II edited his design and proposed the new version, this time discarding the anthropomorphic form, the eagle-like Garuda was done in stylised naturalistic style and named ''Rajawali'' (eagle) ''Garuda Pancasila''. President Sukarno presented this design to the cabinet and Prime Minister Hatta. According to [[Abdoel Gaffar Pringgodigdo|AG Pringgodigdo]] in his book \"Sekitar Pancasila\" published by the Minister of Defence and Security, the improved design of ''Garuda Pancasila'' by Sultan Hamid II was officially adopted in United States of Indonesia Cabinet Assembly on 11 February 1950.<ref>[http://kepustakaan-presiden.pnri.go.id/ministers/popup_biodata_pejabat.asp?id=103 Kepustakaan Presiden Republik Indonesia, Hamid II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721122131/http://kepustakaan-presiden.pnri.go.id/ministers/popup_biodata_pejabat.asp?id=103 |date=21 July 2011 }}</ref> At that time, the ''Rajawali Garuda Pancasila'' was still \"bald\" without [[Crest (feathers)|crest]] crowning its head like current version. President Sukarno introduced the national emblem of Indonesia to the public at Hotel Des Indes, Jakarta, on 15 February 1950.\n\nSukarno continued to improve the design of ''Garuda Pancasila''. On 20 March 1950, Sukarno ordered the palace artist Dullah to make several improvements according to his suggestions, such as the addition of a crest and the change of talons position to the scroll. It was believed that Sukarno suggested the crest addition because the \"bald\" Garuda was considered too similar to the [[Great Seal of the United States|bald eagle in the United States Great Seal]].<ref name=\"tempointeraktif.com\"/> Finally, Sultan Hamid II gave the final touch and create the official national emblem rules on scale and colour guide. The design of this last version was still remain the same ever since, and officially recognised and used as the national emblem of the Republic of Indonesia.\n\n== Scroll and motto ==\n{{main|Bhinneka Tunggal Ika}}\n\nThe Garuda clutches in its talons a scroll bearing the National Motto of Indonesia, \"''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]''\" which is an [[Javanese language|Old Javanese]] stanza of the epic poem \"'''''Sutasoma'''''\" attributed to the 14th-century poet sage of the Javanese [[Majapahit Empire]], Empu Tantular.<ref>Purwadi, ''Kisah cinta Ken Arok-Ken Dedes''.

It is commonly displayed in Indonesian state palaces, monuments, government offices, buildings and also Indonesian embassies abroad. It is also used in private offices and buildings, also in the classes of public schools, placed on the wall slightly upper than the President's and Vice-President's photographs that flanked the emblem. Also, it is used on the front of every Naval vessel, denoting governmental status of the vessel. Moreover, every governor and head of cities or regencies wears the National Emblem on their headgear's badge. The President uses it on every plane he/she travelled with. Every Ministry, Provincial, Military and Police flag also uses it on one side.\n\nThe Indonesian National Emblem is used as part of governmental institutions' and organisations' emblems.

For example, the [[Great Indonesia Movement Party]] (Gerindra) used the head of Garuda Pancasila as the main part of their symbol. The rallying symbol of [[Prabowo Subianto]]'s [[2014 Indonesian presidential election|2014 presidential campaign]] also used the ''Garuda Merah'' (red Garuda), a red silhouette of Garuda Pancasila, which raised the controversy and protest whether a partisan non-governmental organisations should be allowed on using the national emblem as rallying symbol.<ref>{{cite news| title='Garuda Luka' Serang Prabowo-Hatta Lewat Dunia Maya | date=8 July 2014 | work=Tribunnews.com| url=http://www.tribunnews.com/pemilu-2014/2014/07/08/garuda-luka-serang-prabowo-hatta-lewat-dunia-maya | language=ID|author=Rendy Sadikin| accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref> The controversy also raised from pro-Prabowo musician [[Ahmad Dhani]] who campaigned through a music video that displays golden Garuda Pancasila \u2014 which looks like the [[Reichsadler|German imperial eagle]], in aesthetic imagery reminiscent of Nazi's style fascism.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nazi-inspired rocker hurts Prabowo\u2019s bid | newspaper=The Jakarta Post| date=26 June 2014| url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/06/26/nazi-inspired-rocker-hurts-prabowo-s-bid.html|author1=Ina Parlina |author2=Margareth S.

The Garuda was a [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], having the wings, beak, and feet of the [[golden eagle]], but a man's arms and trunk. The Garuda is commonly used as an emblem in South and Southeast Asian nations. The use of the Garuda in Indonesia's coat-of-arms invokes the pre-colonial Hindu kingdoms that spanned across the archipelago, from which the present-day Republic of Indonesia is understood to be descended.\n\nHowever, unlike the traditional [[anthropomorphic]] form of Garuda as featured in ancient temples in [[Java]], the [[Bali]]nese Garuda, or the national [[emblem of Thailand]], the design of Indonesia's ''Garuda Pancasila'' is rendered in modern [[naturalism (art)|naturalist]] style. The design of ''Garuda Pancasila'' was inspired by the ''elang Jawa'' or [[Javan hawk-eagle]] (''Nisaetus bartelsi''), an endangered [[Bird of prey|raptor]] endemic to the mountainous forest regions of [[Java]]. The Javan hawk-eagle's resemblance to the ''Garuda Pancasila'' is most obvious with the prominent [[Crest (feathers)|crest]] crowning its head and the plumage coloured dark-brownish to chestnut-gold. By presidential decree, the Javan hawk-eagle was legally registered as the national bird of Indonesia, and thus attributing the endangered species very high protection.<ref name=\"Keppres No.4/1993\">Keputusan Presiden No. 4/1993, issued on 10 January 1993, the status of ''Elang Jawa'' (Javan hawk-eagle) as the national bird of Indonesia (Widyastuti 1993, S\u00f6zer et al. 1998).</ref>\n\nAs for the national emblem, the Garuda symbolises strength and power, while the gold colour symbolises greatness and glory.<ref name=\"Indonesia.go.id\"/>\n\nThe feathers on the Garuda of the Indonesian coat-of-arms are arranged so that they invoke the date of 17 August 1945, the officially recognised Indonesian Day of Independence. The total number of feathers symbolises the date of the proclamation of Indonesian independence:<ref name=\"Indonesia.go.id\"/> \n* The number of feathers on each wing totals 17 \n* The number of feathers on the tail totals 8 \n* The number of feathers below the shield or base of tail totals 19 \n* The number of feathers on the neck totals 45\nThese numbers of feathers correspond to \"17/8/1945\" [[Calendar date#Little endian forms, starting with the day|international date format]] for Indonesian Independence Day.\n\n===Emblems===\nEach section of the shield has a symbol corresponding to the [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] principles laid down by its founder, President [[Sukarno]]. The numbers of some elements in these symbols might evokes certain numbers, such as 17 and 5 which represents the date of independence and the number of principles in Pancasila, respectively.\n\n[[File:Pancasila Perisai.svg|left|80px]]\n\n===Escutcheon===\nThe escutcheon is a martial symbol, representing the defence of the country. It is divided into five sections: a background divided into quarters, coloured red and white (the colours of the national flag) in a checkerboard pattern; and a smaller, concentric shield, black in background. A thick, black line lies horizontally across the shield, symbolising the [[equator]] which passes through the Indonesian archipelago.<ref name=\"Indonesia.go.id\"/>\n\n[[File:Pancasila Sila 1 Star.svg|left|80px]]\n\n====Star====\nThe black shield bearing the golden star at centre corresponds to the first ''Pancasila principle'': \"Belief in One Supreme God\" (''Ketuhanan yang Maha Esa'').<ref name=\"Indonesia.go.id\"/> The colour black represents the colour of nature. Upon this shield at centre is a golden, five-pointed star. This is a symbol common not only among Indonesia's sanctioned faiths of [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]], but of the secular ideology of [[socialism]] as well.<ref name=\"DEPTINFO4647\">Department of Information, Republic of Indonesia (1999), pp46-47</ref>\n\nThis tenet of ''Pancasila'' has always been controversial, for it suggests compulsory religious belief as well as compulsory [[monotheism]]. Supporters of Sukarno's legacy, however, believe that this tenet was meant to unify Indonesia's population, who have diverse faiths and beliefs.\n\n[[File:Pancasila Sila 2 Chain.svg|left|80px]]\n\n====Chain====\nIn the bottom right quarter, on a red background, is a chain made up of 9 round links representing women and 8 square links representing men, together they sum the number 17. This chain represents successive human generations.

The Garuda claws gripping a white ribbon scroll inscribed with the national motto ''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]'' written in black text, which can be loosely translated as \"Unity in Diversity\". ''Garuda Pancasila'' was designed by [[Sultan Hamid II]] from [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]], supervised by [[Sukarno]], and was adopted as the national emblem on 11 February 1950.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Airlangga.jpg|thumb|left|upright|200px|Statue of King [[Airlangga]] depicted as [[Vishnu]] mounting Garuda.]]\n\n[[Garuda]], the discipled carrier or vehicle ([[vahana]]) of Lord [[Vishnu]], appears in many ancient [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples of ancient Indonesia. Temples such as [[Mendut]], [[Borobudur]], [[Sajiwan]], [[Prambanan]], [[Kidal Temple|Kidal]], [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], Belahan, and [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] depict the images (bas-relief or statue) of Garuda. In [[Prambanan]] temple complex there is a single temple located in front of [[Vishnu]] [[temple]], dedicated to Garuda. However, there is no statue of Garuda inside the chamber today. In the Shiva temple, also in [[Prambanan]] complex, there is a relief telling an episode of [[Ramayana]] about Garuda's nephew who also belongs to the bird-god race, [[Jatayu (Ramayana)|Jatayu]], tried to rescue [[Sita]] from [[Ravana]]'s hand. The deified statue of [[King]] [[Airlangga]] depicted as [[Vishnu]] mounting Garuda from Belahan, probably the most famous statue of [[Garuda]] from ancient Java. Now the statue is one of the important collection of [[Trowulan Museum]].\n\nGaruda appear in many traditions and stories, especially in [[Java]] and [[Bali]]. In many stories Garuda symbolises the virtue of knowledge, power, bravery, loyalty, and discipline. As the vehicle of Vishnu, Garuda also bears the attributes of Vishnu, which symbolise preservation of cosmic order. Balinese tradition venerated Garuda as \"the lord of all flying creatures\", and \"the majestic king of birds\". In Bali, Garuda traditionally portrayed as a divine creature with head, beak, wings, and claw of an eagle, while has the body of a human. Usually portrayed in intricate carving with golden and vivid colours, as the vehicle of Vishnu or in battle scene against [[N\u0101ga]] ([[dragon]]) [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]]. The important and noble position of Garuda in Indonesian tradition since ancient times has venerated Garuda as the national symbol of Indonesia, the embodiment of Indonesian ideology, ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]''. Garuda also chosen as the name of Indonesian national airlines, [[Garuda Indonesia]]. Next to Indonesia, [[Thailand]] also uses the Garuda as its [[Emblem of Thailand|national symbol]].\n\nAfter the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] ended and followed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] acknowledgement of the Indonesian independence in 1949, there is a need to create a [[national emblem]] of [[United States of Indonesia]]. On 10 January 1950 the Committee of State Seal was formed, under co-ordination of Sultan Hamid II of Pontianak as the State Minister of No [[Ministry (government department)|Portfolio]], with [[Muhammad Yamin]] as the chairman, and [[Ki Hajar Dewantara]], M. A. [[Melkias Agustinus Pellaupessy]], [[Mohammad Natsir]], and Raden Mas Ngabehi [[Poerbatjaraka]] as committee members. The committee task is to select the proposals of United States of Indonesia national emblem to be presented to the government.\n\n[[File:Proposed Republik Indonesia Serikat (United States of Indonesia) COA 4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The initial design of ''Garuda Pancasila'' design by Sultan Hamid II, still featuring an anthropomorphic Garuda.]]\n\nAccording to [[Mohammad Hatta]], in his memoire \"Bung Hatta Menjawab\", to fulfill the mandate of the Cabinet, Minister Priyono had launched the design competition. After the competition was held, there were two proposed designs selected as the finalist; one was the work of Sultan Hamid II and the other one was the work of Muhammad Yamin. In further process the design proposed by [[Sultan Hamid II]] was accepted by both [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (DPR) and the Government, while Yamin's design was rejected because featuring shining sun emblem that deemed clearly demonstrate the influence of [[Rising Sun Flag|Japanese Empire flag]]. Sukarno as The President of United States of Indonesia together with Mohammad Hatta as the Prime Minister, asked Sultan Hamid II to change the red and white ribbon being held by Garuda talons to white scroll bearing the national motto \"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\". On 8 February 1950, the design created by Sultan Hamid II was presented to President Sukarno. The design featuring Garuda in its [[anthropomorphic]] form, similar to traditional depiction of Garuda in ancient Javanese, Balinese, and Siamese art. However, the Islamic party [[Masyumi]] expressed their objection and stated that the bird with human neck and shoulders with both hands holding the ''Pancasila'' shield was too mythical.<ref name=\"tempointeraktif.com\">[http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/hukum/2010/01/27/brk,20100127-221646,id.html Lambang Garuda Pancasila Dirancang Seorang Sultan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809092108/http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/hukum/2010/01/27/brk,20100127-221646,id.html |date=9 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Winner Republik Indonesia Serikat (United States of Indonesia) COA 1950.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''Garuda Pancasila'' adopted on 11 February 1950, still without crest and with different position of talons.]]\n\nSultan Hamid II edited his design and proposed the new version, this time discarding the anthropomorphic form, the eagle-like Garuda was done in stylised naturalistic style and named ''Rajawali'' (eagle) ''Garuda Pancasila''. President Sukarno presented this design to the cabinet and Prime Minister Hatta. According to [[Abdoel Gaffar Pringgodigdo|AG Pringgodigdo]] in his book \"Sekitar Pancasila\" published by the Minister of Defence and Security, the improved design of ''Garuda Pancasila'' by Sultan Hamid II was officially adopted in United States of Indonesia Cabinet Assembly on 11 February 1950.<ref>[http://kepustakaan-presiden.pnri.go.id/ministers/popup_biodata_pejabat.asp?id=103 Kepustakaan Presiden Republik Indonesia, Hamid II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721122131/http://kepustakaan-presiden.pnri.go.id/ministers/popup_biodata_pejabat.asp?id=103 |date=21 July 2011 }}</ref> At that time, the ''Rajawali Garuda Pancasila'' was still \"bald\" without [[Crest (feathers)|crest]] crowning its head like current version. President Sukarno introduced the national emblem of Indonesia to the public at Hotel Des Indes, Jakarta, on 15 February 1950.\n\nSukarno continued to improve the design of ''Garuda Pancasila''. On 20 March 1950, Sukarno ordered the palace artist Dullah to make several improvements according to his suggestions, such as the addition of a crest and the change of talons position to the scroll. It was believed that Sukarno suggested the crest addition because the \"bald\" Garuda was considered too similar to the [[Great Seal of the United States|bald eagle in the United States Great Seal]].<ref name=\"tempointeraktif.com\"/> Finally, Sultan Hamid II gave the final touch and create the official national emblem rules on scale and colour guide. The design of this last version was still remain the same ever since, and officially recognised and used as the national emblem of the Republic of Indonesia.\n\n== Scroll and motto ==\n{{main|Bhinneka Tunggal Ika}}\n\nThe Garuda clutches in its talons a scroll bearing the National Motto of Indonesia, \"''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]''\" which is an [[Javanese language|Old Javanese]] stanza of the epic poem \"'''''Sutasoma'''''\" attributed to the 14th-century poet sage of the Javanese [[Majapahit Empire]], Empu Tantular.<ref>Purwadi, ''Kisah cinta Ken Arok-Ken Dedes''.

It is commonly displayed in Indonesian state palaces, monuments, government offices, buildings and also Indonesian embassies abroad. It is also used in private offices and buildings, also in the classes of public schools, placed on the wall slightly upper than the President's and Vice-President's photographs that flanked the emblem. Also, it is used on the front of every Naval vessel, denoting governmental status of the vessel. Moreover, every governor and head of cities or regencies wears the National Emblem on their headgear's badge. The President uses it on every plane he/she travelled with. Every Ministry, Provincial, Military and Police flag also uses it on one side.\n\nThe Indonesian National Emblem is used as part of governmental institutions' and organisations' emblems.

For example, the [[Great Indonesia Movement Party]] (Gerindra) used the head of Garuda Pancasila as the main part of their symbol. The rallying symbol of [[Prabowo Subianto]]'s [[2014 Indonesian presidential election|2014 presidential campaign]] also used the ''Garuda Merah'' (red Garuda), a red silhouette of Garuda Pancasila, which raised the controversy and protest whether a partisan non-governmental organisations should be allowed on using the national emblem as rallying symbol.<ref>{{cite news| title='Garuda Luka' Serang Prabowo-Hatta Lewat Dunia Maya | date=8 July 2014 | work=Tribunnews.com| url=http://www.tribunnews.com/pemilu-2014/2014/07/08/garuda-luka-serang-prabowo-hatta-lewat-dunia-maya | language=ID|author=Rendy Sadikin| accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref> The controversy also raised from pro-Prabowo musician [[Ahmad Dhani]] who campaigned through a music video that displays golden Garuda Pancasila \u2014 which looks like the [[Reichsadler|German imperial eagle]], in aesthetic imagery reminiscent of Nazi's style fascism.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nazi-inspired rocker hurts Prabowo\u2019s bid | newspaper=The Jakarta Post| date=26 June 2014| url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/06/26/nazi-inspired-rocker-hurts-prabowo-s-bid.html|author1=Ina Parlina |author2=Margareth S.

The Garuda was a [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], having the wings, beak, and feet of the [[golden eagle]], but a man's arms and trunk. The Garuda is commonly used as an emblem in South and Southeast Asian nations. The use of the Garuda in Indonesia's coat-of-arms invokes the pre-colonial Hindu kingdoms that spanned across the archipelago, from which the present-day Republic of Indonesia is understood to be descended.\n\nHowever, unlike the traditional [[anthropomorphic]] form of Garuda as featured in ancient temples in [[Java]], the [[Bali]]nese Garuda, or the national [[emblem of Thailand]], the design of Indonesia's ''Garuda Pancasila'' is rendered in modern [[naturalism (art)|naturalist]] style. The design of ''Garuda Pancasila'' was inspired by the ''elang Jawa'' or [[Javan hawk-eagle]] (''Nisaetus bartelsi''), an endangered [[Bird of prey|raptor]] endemic to the mountainous forest regions of [[Java]]. The Javan hawk-eagle's resemblance to the ''Garuda Pancasila'' is most obvious with the prominent [[Crest (feathers)|crest]] crowning its head and the plumage coloured dark-brownish to chestnut-gold. By presidential decree, the Javan hawk-eagle was legally registered as the national bird of Indonesia, and thus attributing the endangered species very high protection.<ref name=\"Keppres No.4/1993\">Keputusan Presiden No. 4/1993, issued on 10 January 1993, the status of ''Elang Jawa'' (Javan hawk-eagle) as the national bird of Indonesia (Widyastuti 1993, S\u00f6zer et al. 1998).</ref>\n\nAs for the national emblem, the Garuda symbolises strength and power, while the gold colour symbolises greatness and glory.<ref name=\"Indonesia.go.id\"/>\n\nThe feathers on the Garuda of the Indonesian coat-of-arms are arranged so that they invoke the date of 17 August 1945, the officially recognised Indonesian Day of Independence. The total number of feathers symbolises the date of the proclamation of Indonesian independence:<ref name=\"Indonesia.go.id\"/> \n* The number of feathers on each wing totals 17 \n* The number of feathers on the tail totals 8 \n* The number of feathers below the shield or base of tail totals 19 \n* The number of feathers on the neck totals 45\nThese numbers of feathers correspond to \"17/8/1945\" [[Calendar date#Little endian forms, starting with the day|international date format]] for Indonesian Independence Day.\n\n===Emblems===\nEach section of the shield has a symbol corresponding to the [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] principles laid down by its founder, President [[Sukarno]]. The numbers of some elements in these symbols might evokes certain numbers, such as 17 and 5 which represents the date of independence and the number of principles in Pancasila, respectively.\n\n[[File:Pancasila Perisai.svg|left|80px]]\n\n===Escutcheon===\nThe escutcheon is a martial symbol, representing the defence of the country. It is divided into five sections: a background divided into quarters, coloured red and white (the colours of the national flag) in a checkerboard pattern; and a smaller, concentric shield, black in background. A thick, black line lies horizontally across the shield, symbolising the [[equator]] which passes through the Indonesian archipelago.<ref name=\"Indonesia.go.id\"/>\n\n[[File:Pancasila Sila 1 Star.svg|left|80px]]\n\n====Star====\nThe black shield bearing the golden star at centre corresponds to the first ''Pancasila principle'': \"Belief in One Supreme God\" (''Ketuhanan yang Maha Esa'').<ref name=\"Indonesia.go.id\"/> The colour black represents the colour of nature. Upon this shield at centre is a golden, five-pointed star. This is a symbol common not only among Indonesia's sanctioned faiths of [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]], but of the secular ideology of [[socialism]] as well.<ref name=\"DEPTINFO4647\">Department of Information, Republic of Indonesia (1999), pp46-47</ref>\n\nThis tenet of ''Pancasila'' has always been controversial, for it suggests compulsory religious belief as well as compulsory [[monotheism]]. Supporters of Sukarno's legacy, however, believe that this tenet was meant to unify Indonesia's population, who have diverse faiths and beliefs.\n\n[[File:Pancasila Sila 2 Chain.svg|left|80px]]\n\n====Chain====\nIn the bottom right quarter, on a red background, is a chain made up of 9 round links representing women and 8 square links representing men, together they sum the number 17.

What Bantu doesn't know is that he's actually the son of a businessman swapped by Valmiki with his own son to give the latter a comfortable life. A violent incident draws Bantu closer to the truth, upon learning which he decides to enter Vaikunthapurram, the home of his real parents and eventually confront those who threaten his family.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on 12 January 2020, coinciding with [[Makar Sankranti|Sankranti]].

Ramachandra falls in love with ARK\u2019s daughter Yasu ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]), and becomes rich through his marriage to her in no time while Valmiki remains poor. On the day of the birth of both Valmiki\u2019s and Ramachandra\u2019s children, Ramachandra\u2019s son appears to be dead, so the nurse Sulochana ([[Easwari Rao]]) and Valmiki switch the two boys out. However, when Valmiki takes the child down, the child begins to cry and turns out to be alive. The nurse wants to switch them out again, but Valmiki prevents her from doing it and accidentally pushes her off a ledge. The nurse goes into a coma, while Valmiki gets a leg cramp that makes him limp permanently.\n\nThe boys, Raj Manohar ([[Sushanth]]) and Bantu ([[Allu Arjun]]), are raised in two different worlds. Raj is a slow, silent, young rich boy while Bantu is a smart, outspoken, hard working, middle class man. Valmiki always favors Raj no matter how hard Bantu tries to impress Valmiki. He treats Bantu with hatred and neglect due to his true parentage, even going as far as to cancel his MBA scholarship. On his way to an interview at a travel agency, Bantu\u2019s sister\u2019s scarf is pulled off by Shekhar ([[Navdeep]]). Angry, Bantu follows Shekhar and his friends and thrashes them. Ravindra ([[Rahul Ramakrishna]]) interviews Bantu and reveals that Shekhar is the agency's HR manager. Bantu apologizes to Shekhar and convinces him with his wits, successfully getting a job at the travel agency. On his first day of work, Bantu get infatuated with his boss Amulya ([[Pooja Hegde]]), and stares at her legs on the elevator, without realizing she is the CEO of the travel agency. As a result, Amulya gives Bantu some tough assignments to teach him a lesson. After a trip to Paris together, she begins to reciprocate Bantu\u2019s feelings for her. Meanwhile, Raj returns from abroad, unable to complete his MBA. Ramachandra sends Raj to reject Paidithalli ([[Govind Padmasoorya]]) who wants to buy 50% of ARK\u2019s shares. Ramachandra watches from a hotel where Amulya, Bantu, and Sudarshan ([[Brahmaji]]) have a meeting. Ramachandra is disappointed by Raj\u2019s hesitance and inability to say no to Paidithalli, but is proud of Bantu and Amulya for saying no to Sudarshan, who wanted to buy Amulya\u2019s travel agency. Due to this, ARK fixes an engagement between Raj and Amulya, but Raj was actually in love with his cousin Nandini ([[Nivetha Pethuraj]]).\n\nDue to Bantu\u2019s refusal, Sudarshan files a case against Bantu and Amulya. Amulya finally reveals her feelings for Bantu while reprimanding him for his inability to lie to others. Bantu convinces her to tell Ramachandra the truth-that she is in love with Bantu and does not want to marry Raj. Appala Naidu ([[Samuthirakani]]), a powerful and influential man, as well as Paidithalli\u2019s father, attempts to kill Ramachandra because of the refusal moments before Amulya and Bantu arrive. Bantu saves Ramachandra and takes him to the hospital. Bantu meets Sulochana, who has come out of her coma, and learns of his true parentage. Angry, Bantu slaps Valmiki and tells him that he knows the truth about his birth. He blackmails Ramachandra\u2019s doctor, Shrinivas ([[Vennela Kishore]]) to enter Vaikuntapuram - Ramachandra's home. ARK is fond of Bantu for saving Ramachandra, fixing his relationship with Yasu, setting Paidathalli straight, and handling other business problems. \n\nDue to all this, ARK throws a huge party in happiness, where Yasu witnesses Bantu and Amulya kissing and reports it to the household. Bantu is kicked out by Valmiki and the engagement is cancelled. Appala Naidu uses this to his advantage, kidnapping Nandu and threatening to kill her unless Ramachandra signs off the shares for Paidithalli. When Valmiki begs Bantu to save Nandu, he refuses, but goes anyway. He thrashes the goons, slams Paidathalli, and stabs Appala Naidu with a kebab skewer. But later, Raj comes and saves Appala Naidu and his henchmen, thus Appala Naidu comes out of his enmity with Ramachandra by seeing Raj's humanity.\n\nWhen Bantu and Valmiki are at Vaikuntapuram, ARK slaps Valmiki and reveals that he heard the conversation between Sulochana and Bantu right before her death. Bantu is able to reunite with his biological father, Ramachandra, but asks him not to reveal this secret to Yasu, because Yasu is still thinking that Raj is her biological son, if he says the truth, then Yasu will get depressed. However Yasu and Raj hear this conversation and Yasu agrees Bantu as his son and the family decides to give him 50% of the company\u2019s shares. Raj also accepts Valmiki as his father and stay in his house happily for five years or more to gain the skills necessary to become the CEO. Valmiki struggles to accept the fact that Raj feels better suited in a middle class setting, repenting for the mistake he made 25 years ago. The film ends with Bantu going to his office as CEO with his wife Amulya in helicopter which makes Valmiki jealous.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Allu Arjun]] as Bantu / \u201cRaja\u201d as a nurse calls him\n* [[Pooja Hegde]] as Amulya / \u201cAmmu\u201d\n* [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] as Yasoda \u201cYasu\u201d Radhakrishna, Bantu's real mother\n* [[Jayaram]] as Ramachandra, Bantu's real father\n* [[Sushanth]] as Raj Manohar \n* [[Navdeep]] as Shekhar\n* [[Nivetha Pethuraj]] as Nandini \u201cNandu\u201d\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as Valmiki, Raj\u2019s real father\n* [[Ananth Babu]] as Pujari/ Pujari\n* [[Rohini]] as Lakshmi, Valmiki\u2019s wife\n* [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] as [[Deputy Inspector General of Police|DIG]] Govardhan Prajapati\n* [[Sachin Khedekar]] as Ananth Radhakrishna (ARK), Yasu's husband \n* [[Samuthirakani]] as Appala Naidu\n* [[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]] as Sitaram \n* [[Harsha Vardhan]] as Kashiram, Nandini's father\n* [[Govind Padmasoorya]] as Paidithalli \n* [[Rahul Ramakrishna]] as K.

A violent incident draws Bantu closer to the truth, upon learning which he decides to enter Vaikunthapurram, the home of his real parents and eventually confront those who threaten his family.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on 12 January 2020, coinciding with [[Makar Sankranti|Sankranti]].

Ramachandra falls in love with ARK\u2019s daughter Yasu ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]), and becomes rich through his marriage to her in no time while Valmiki remains poor. On the day of the birth of both Valmiki\u2019s and Ramachandra\u2019s children, Ramachandra\u2019s son appears to be dead, so the nurse Sulochana ([[Easwari Rao]]) and Valmiki switch the two boys out. However, when Valmiki takes the child down, the child begins to cry and turns out to be alive. The nurse wants to switch them out again, but Valmiki prevents her from doing it and accidentally pushes her off a ledge. The nurse goes into a coma, while Valmiki gets a leg cramp that makes him limp permanently.\n\nThe boys, Raj Manohar ([[Sushanth]]) and Bantu ([[Allu Arjun]]), are raised in two different worlds. Raj is a slow, silent, young rich boy while Bantu is a smart, outspoken, hard working, middle class man. Valmiki always favors Raj no matter how hard Bantu tries to impress Valmiki. He treats Bantu with hatred and neglect due to his true parentage, even going as far as to cancel his MBA scholarship. On his way to an interview at a travel agency, Bantu\u2019s sister\u2019s scarf is pulled off by Shekhar ([[Navdeep]]). Angry, Bantu follows Shekhar and his friends and thrashes them. Ravindra ([[Rahul Ramakrishna]]) interviews Bantu and reveals that Shekhar is the agency's HR manager. Bantu apologizes to Shekhar and convinces him with his wits, successfully getting a job at the travel agency. On his first day of work, Bantu get infatuated with his boss Amulya ([[Pooja Hegde]]), and stares at her legs on the elevator, without realizing she is the CEO of the travel agency. As a result, Amulya gives Bantu some tough assignments to teach him a lesson. After a trip to Paris together, she begins to reciprocate Bantu\u2019s feelings for her. Meanwhile, Raj returns from abroad, unable to complete his MBA. Ramachandra sends Raj to reject Paidithalli ([[Govind Padmasoorya]]) who wants to buy 50% of ARK\u2019s shares. Ramachandra watches from a hotel where Amulya, Bantu, and Sudarshan ([[Brahmaji]]) have a meeting. Ramachandra is disappointed by Raj\u2019s hesitance and inability to say no to Paidithalli, but is proud of Bantu and Amulya for saying no to Sudarshan, who wanted to buy Amulya\u2019s travel agency. Due to this, ARK fixes an engagement between Raj and Amulya, but Raj was actually in love with his cousin Nandini ([[Nivetha Pethuraj]]).\n\nDue to Bantu\u2019s refusal, Sudarshan files a case against Bantu and Amulya. Amulya finally reveals her feelings for Bantu while reprimanding him for his inability to lie to others. Bantu convinces her to tell Ramachandra the truth-that she is in love with Bantu and does not want to marry Raj. Appala Naidu ([[Samuthirakani]]), a powerful and influential man, as well as Paidithalli\u2019s father, attempts to kill Ramachandra because of the refusal moments before Amulya and Bantu arrive. Bantu saves Ramachandra and takes him to the hospital. Bantu meets Sulochana, who has come out of her coma, and learns of his true parentage. Angry, Bantu slaps Valmiki and tells him that he knows the truth about his birth. He blackmails Ramachandra\u2019s doctor, Shrinivas ([[Vennela Kishore]]) to enter Vaikuntapuram - Ramachandra's home. ARK is fond of Bantu for saving Ramachandra, fixing his relationship with Yasu, setting Paidathalli straight, and handling other business problems. \n\nDue to all this, ARK throws a huge party in happiness, where Yasu witnesses Bantu and Amulya kissing and reports it to the household. Bantu is kicked out by Valmiki and the engagement is cancelled. Appala Naidu uses this to his advantage, kidnapping Nandu and threatening to kill her unless Ramachandra signs off the shares for Paidithalli. When Valmiki begs Bantu to save Nandu, he refuses, but goes anyway. He thrashes the goons, slams Paidathalli, and stabs Appala Naidu with a kebab skewer. But later, Raj comes and saves Appala Naidu and his henchmen, thus Appala Naidu comes out of his enmity with Ramachandra by seeing Raj's humanity.\n\nWhen Bantu and Valmiki are at Vaikuntapuram, ARK slaps Valmiki and reveals that he heard the conversation between Sulochana and Bantu right before her death. Bantu is able to reunite with his biological father, Ramachandra, but asks him not to reveal this secret to Yasu, because Yasu is still thinking that Raj is her biological son, if he says the truth, then Yasu will get depressed. However Yasu and Raj hear this conversation and Yasu agrees Bantu as his son and the family decides to give him 50% of the company\u2019s shares. Raj also accepts Valmiki as his father and stay in his house happily for five years or more to gain the skills necessary to become the CEO. Valmiki struggles to accept the fact that Raj feels better suited in a middle class setting, repenting for the mistake he made 25 years ago. The film ends with Bantu going to his office as CEO with his wife Amulya in helicopter which makes Valmiki jealous.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Allu Arjun]] as Bantu / \u201cRaja\u201d as a nurse calls him\n* [[Pooja Hegde]] as Amulya / \u201cAmmu\u201d\n* [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] as Yasoda \u201cYasu\u201d Radhakrishna, Bantu's real mother\n* [[Jayaram]] as Ramachandra, Bantu's real father\n* [[Sushanth]] as Raj Manohar \n* [[Navdeep]] as Shekhar\n* [[Nivetha Pethuraj]] as Nandini \u201cNandu\u201d\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as Valmiki, Raj\u2019s real father\n* [[Ananth Babu]] as Pujari/ Pujari\n* [[Rohini]] as Lakshmi, Valmiki\u2019s wife\n* [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] as [[Deputy Inspector General of Police|DIG]] Govardhan Prajapati\n* [[Sachin Khedekar]] as Ananth Radhakrishna (ARK), Yasu's husband \n* [[Samuthirakani]] as Appala Naidu\n* [[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]] as Sitaram \n* [[Harsha Vardhan]] as Kashiram, Nandini's father\n* [[Govind Padmasoorya]] as Paidithalli \n* [[Rahul Ramakrishna]] as K.
