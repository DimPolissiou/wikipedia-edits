The band originally consisted of [[Brad Arnold]] (lead vocals, drums), Matt Roberts (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Todd Harrell (bass guitar). The band rose to international fame with their first single, \"[[Kryptonite (3 Doors Down song)|Kryptonite]]\", which placed in the top three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The band then signed with [[Republic Records]] and released their debut album, ''[[The Better Life]]'', in 2000. The album was the 11th-best-selling album of the year and was certified [[RIAA certification|6x platinum]] in the United States. The group was later joined by drummer Richard Liles, who played during the tour for their first album.\n\nThe band's second album, ''[[Away from the Sun]]'' (2002), continued the band's success; it debuted at No.&nbsp;8 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, went multi-platinum in the U.S. like its predecessor, and spawned the hits \"[[When I'm Gone (3 Doors Down song)|When I'm Gone]]\" and \"[[Here Without You]]\". The band toured extensively for two years. [[Daniel Adair]] played drums on tour from 2002 to 2006. This configuration played nearly 1,000 shows across the world following the release of ''Away from the Sun''. In 2005, Greg Upchurch ([[Puddle of Mudd]]) joined to play drums to replace Adair. 3 Doors Down released their third album, ''[[Seventeen Days]]'', in 2005. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum within one month of release. Their fourth album, ''[[3 Doors Down (album)|3 Doors Down]]'' (2008), also debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The band's fifth studio album, ''[[Time of My Life (3 Doors Down album)|Time of My Life]]'' (2011) debuted at No.&nbsp;3 on the charts.\n\nOriginal guitarist Matt Roberts departed in 2012, owing to health issues. He was replaced by Chet Roberts, who was formerly Chris Henderson's guitar tech. Harrell was fired from the band in 2013 after being charged with [[vehicular homicide]], and was replaced by bassist Justin Biltonen.<ref name=ug>{{cite web|title=New 3 Doors Down Material Coming in 2014, Guitarist Chris Henderson Confirms|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/new_3_doors_down_material_coming_in_2014_guitarist_chris_henderson_confirms.html|work=Ultimate Guitar|date=January 23, 2014|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> 3 Doors Down has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formative years: 1996\u20131998===\n3 Doors Down initially consisted of Brad Arnold as the lead vocalist and drummer, Matt Roberts as the lead guitarist and backing vocalist, and Todd Harrell as the bass guitarist. The band began to tour outside Escatawpa, eventually coming up with their official name during a trip to [[Foley, Alabama]]. When the three were walking through the town, they saw a building where some letters had fallen off its sign, reading \"Doors Down\". Since the band consisted of three people at the time, they added the \"3\" to create \"3 Doors Down\". The cover of their 2011 album ''[[Time of My Life (3 Doors Down album)|Time of My Life]]'' hints at the original number of band members (3) and current band members (5); the clock on the album cover reads 3:05.\n\nA couple of years after performing together, Todd Harrell asked rhythm guitarist Chris Henderson to join the band in 1998. 3 Doors Down recorded a demo CD of their original songs at Lincoln Recording in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]]. When the band gave the CD to local radio station [[WCPR-FM]], they started playing the [[extended play|EP]] version of \"[[Kryptonite (3 Doors Down song)|Kryptonite]]\" and it became the No.&nbsp;1 requested song on the station for over 15 weeks.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> The station's program director sent the song to manager Phin Daly who in turn showed it to Bill McGathy, his employer at In De Goot Entertainment. They decided to fly the band into New York to perform a showcase at the [[CBGB]] music club. Daly told [[HitQuarters]]: \"Once they got on stage and started playing it was apparent the magic was in the music. So we moved to sign them.\"<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Phin_Daly_Interview.html |title=Interview with Phin Daly|publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=November 1, 2001|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Mainstream success: 1999\u20132004===\n3 Doors Down's first studio album, ''[[The Better Life]]'', was released on February 8, 2000 and went on to become the 11th best-selling album of the year, selling over three million copies. It has since been certified 6x platinum, thanks in large part to the international hit singles, \"Kryptonite\", \"[[Loser (3 Doors Down song)|Loser]]\", and \"[[Duck and Run]]\". A fourth single, \"[[Be Like That]]\" was re-recorded for the 2001 film ''[[American Pie 2]]'', with alternate lyrics for the first three lines; this version is known as the \"''American Pie 2'' Edit\". Whilst recording the album, Brad Arnold recorded both the vocal and drum tracks. The band hired drummer Richard Liles for the tour in support of ''The Better Life'' so that Arnold could perform at the front of the stage. Liles left in late 2001.\n\nThe band's second studio album, ''[[Away from the Sun]]'', was released on November 12, 2002 and went platinum within two months of release.<ref>Larkin, C.

[[Rush (band)|Rush]] guitarist [[Alex Lifeson]] produced and performed on three tracks for the record, \"Dangerous Game\", \"Dead Love\", and \"Wasted Me\", but only \"Dangerous Game\" would appear on the finished product. The band hired Canadian [[Daniel Adair]] to play drums for the ''Away From the Sun'' tour. He would go on to record the drums for the band's next studio release, and was with the band aboard the [[USS George Washington (CVN-73)|USS ''George Washington'' (CVN-73)]] to film the music video \"When I'm Gone\".\n\nIn 2003, 3 Doors Down released a live EP entitled ''[[Another 700 Miles]]'' consisting of recordings from a live performance by the band in Chicago, Illinois. ''Another 700 Miles'' has since been certified Gold in the United States. In addition to featuring some of 3 Doors Down's hit singles from their previous two albums, the EP also contains a version of the popular 1977 [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] song \"[[That Smell]]\".

From the tailend of 2012 through to March 2013, 3 Doors Down went on a joint headlining tour with US rock band [[Daughtry (band)|Daughtry]] to promote Daughtry's 3rd studio album release. The cover of \"In the Air Tonight\" was captured and uploaded to Daughtry's official YouTube channel. The band also played the Dubai Jazz Festival in February 2013.\n\nOn April 20, 2013, bassist Todd Harrell was charged with [[vehicular homicide]] for his actions the night before in Nashville, Tennessee. He was reportedly driving on [[I-40]] at a high speed while under the influence of prescription medication when he caused an accident that killed 47-year-old Paul Howard Shoulders, Jr.  The judge in the trial granted the request by Harrell's lawyers to have Harrell placed on house arrest while awaiting trial.  The judge granted the defense request, but harshly criticized the musician's doctor in the courtroom, accusing the physician of prescribing Harrell far too many pain pills.  The judge stated that Harrell \"got 360 Oxycodone and 60 Oxycontin pills from his doctor in less than 30 days, which is well outside the amount that is usually prescribed in the due course of medical treatment.\"  Harrell was also charged with bringing a controlled substance into a correctional detention facility, after it was discovered during the booking process at Nashville's Metro Jail that Harrell had a plastic bag hidden in his sock that contained eight [[Xanax]] pills, twenty four [[Oxycodone]] pills, and four [[Oxymorphone]] pills. Harrell's court and trial dates have been repeatedly postponed by Harrell's attorneys for various reasons.  Harrell's original court dates of May 28 and 29, 2014 for the vehicular homicide charge were postponed and the court date for his previous DUI from 2012 was postponed since Harrell had voluntarily gone into rehab at an undisclosed location and remained there on the date set for the charge to go to court. In May 2014, the trial was moved to July 23, 2014.  The trial was again postponed by the judge at the request of Harrell's attorneys, pending a status hearing in September 2014.  A status hearing took place on September 19, 2014 for Harrell's vehicular homicide charge, in which the judge agreed to postpone the trial again and allow Harrell to remain on house arrest pending his trial.  As of January 2015, no trial date for the vehicular homicide charge had been set due to the multiple postponement requests by Harrell's attorneys, reportedly due to the fact that Harrell has been in rehab for treatment for addictions to alcohol and prescription pain medication. In December 2015, Harrell was sentenced to two years imprisonment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsmv.com/story/30789363/former-3-doors-down-bassist-sentenced-in-vehicular-homicide-case|title=Former 3 Doors Down bassist sentenced in vehicular homicide case|date=December 18, 2015|author=Sanders, Forrest|publisher=[[WSMV-TV]]|access-date=2017-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104234413/http://www.wsmv.com/story/30789363/former-3-doors-down-bassist-sentenced-in-vehicular-homicide-case|archive-date=2017-01-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> followed by six years of probation.\n\n3 Doors Down later announced that the four scheduled shows in the U.S. for April and May had been cancelled out of respect for Shoulders and his family.

The band originally consisted of [[Brad Arnold]] (lead vocals, drums), Matt Roberts (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Todd Harrell (bass guitar). The band rose to international fame with their first single, \"[[Kryptonite (3 Doors Down song)|Kryptonite]]\", which placed in the top three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The band then signed with [[Republic Records]] and released their debut album, ''[[The Better Life]]'', in 2000. The album was the 11th-best-selling album of the year and was certified [[RIAA certification|6x platinum]] in the United States. The group was later joined by drummer Richard Liles, who played during the tour for their first album.\n\nThe band's second album, ''[[Away from the Sun]]'' (2002), continued the band's success; it debuted at No.&nbsp;8 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, went multi-platinum in the U.S. like its predecessor, and spawned the hits \"[[When I'm Gone (3 Doors Down song)|When I'm Gone]]\" and \"[[Here Without You]]\". The band toured extensively for two years. [[Daniel Adair]] played drums on tour from 2002 to 2006. This configuration played nearly 1,000 shows across the world following the release of ''Away from the Sun''. In 2005, Greg Upchurch ([[Puddle of Mudd]]) joined to play drums to replace Adair. 3 Doors Down released their third album, ''[[Seventeen Days]]'', in 2005. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum within one month of release. Their fourth album, ''[[3 Doors Down (album)|3 Doors Down]]'' (2008), also debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The band's fifth studio album, ''[[Time of My Life (3 Doors Down album)|Time of My Life]]'' (2011) debuted at No.&nbsp;3 on the charts.\n\nOriginal guitarist Matt Roberts departed in 2012, owing to health issues. He was replaced by Chet Roberts, who was formerly Chris Henderson's guitar tech. Harrell was fired from the band in 2013 after being charged with [[vehicular homicide]], and was replaced by bassist Justin Biltonen.<ref name=ug>{{cite web|title=New 3 Doors Down Material Coming in 2014, Guitarist Chris Henderson Confirms|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/new_3_doors_down_material_coming_in_2014_guitarist_chris_henderson_confirms.html|work=Ultimate Guitar|date=January 23, 2014|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> 3 Doors Down has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formative years: 1996\u20131998===\n3 Doors Down initially consisted of Brad Arnold as the lead vocalist and drummer, Matt Roberts as the lead guitarist and backing vocalist, and Todd Harrell as the bass guitarist. The band began to tour outside Escatawpa, eventually coming up with their official name during a trip to [[Foley, Alabama]]. When the three were walking through the town, they saw a building where some letters had fallen off its sign, reading \"Doors Down\". Since the band consisted of three people at the time, they added the \"3\" to create \"3 Doors Down\". The cover of their 2011 album ''[[Time of My Life (3 Doors Down album)|Time of My Life]]'' hints at the original number of band members (3) and current band members (5); the clock on the album cover reads 3:05.\n\nA couple of years after performing together, Todd Harrell asked rhythm guitarist Chris Henderson to join the band in 1998. 3 Doors Down recorded a demo CD of their original songs at Lincoln Recording in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]]. When the band gave the CD to local radio station [[WCPR-FM]], they started playing the [[extended play|EP]] version of \"[[Kryptonite (3 Doors Down song)|Kryptonite]]\" and it became the No.&nbsp;1 requested song on the station for over 15 weeks.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> The station's program director sent the song to manager Phin Daly who in turn showed it to Bill McGathy, his employer at In De Goot Entertainment. They decided to fly the band into New York to perform a showcase at the [[CBGB]] music club. Daly told [[HitQuarters]]: \"Once they got on stage and started playing it was apparent the magic was in the music. So we moved to sign them.\"<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Phin_Daly_Interview.html |title=Interview with Phin Daly|publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=November 1, 2001|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Mainstream success: 1999\u20132004===\n3 Doors Down's first studio album, ''[[The Better Life]]'', was released on February 8, 2000 and went on to become the 11th best-selling album of the year, selling over three million copies. It has since been certified 6x platinum, thanks in large part to the international hit singles, \"Kryptonite\", \"[[Loser (3 Doors Down song)|Loser]]\", and \"[[Duck and Run]]\". A fourth single, \"[[Be Like That]]\" was re-recorded for the 2001 film ''[[American Pie 2]]'', with alternate lyrics for the first three lines; this version is known as the \"''American Pie 2'' Edit\". Whilst recording the album, Brad Arnold recorded both the vocal and drum tracks. The band hired drummer Richard Liles for the tour in support of ''The Better Life'' so that Arnold could perform at the front of the stage. Liles left in late 2001.\n\nThe band's second studio album, ''[[Away from the Sun]]'', was released on November 12, 2002 and went platinum within two months of release.<ref>Larkin, C.

[[Rush (band)|Rush]] guitarist [[Alex Lifeson]] produced and performed on three tracks for the record, \"Dangerous Game\", \"Dead Love\", and \"Wasted Me\", but only \"Dangerous Game\" would appear on the finished product. The band hired Canadian [[Daniel Adair]] to play drums for the ''Away From the Sun'' tour. He would go on to record the drums for the band's next studio release, and was with the band aboard the [[USS George Washington (CVN-73)|USS ''George Washington'' (CVN-73)]] to film the music video \"When I'm Gone\".\n\nIn 2003, 3 Doors Down released a live EP entitled ''[[Another 700 Miles]]'' consisting of recordings from a live performance by the band in Chicago, Illinois. ''Another 700 Miles'' has since been certified Gold in the United States. In addition to featuring some of 3 Doors Down's hit singles from their previous two albums, the EP also contains a version of the popular 1977 [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] song \"[[That Smell]]\". The group toured with [[Nickelback]] in 2004.<ref>Waddel, R. (May 29th, 2004). Hopes high for 3 Doors Down/Nickelback.

During the ''Seventeen Days'' tour, the band appeared alongside southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, as well as headlining many shows of their own.\n\nLater in 2005, the band released a live DVD entitled ''Away from the Sun: Live from Houston, Texas''. The DVD was produced and directed by [[Academy Award]]-nominated [[Alex Gibney]] and Doug Biro.

From the tailend of 2012 through to March 2013, 3 Doors Down went on a joint headlining tour with US rock band [[Daughtry (band)|Daughtry]] to promote Daughtry's 3rd studio album release. The cover of \"In the Air Tonight\" was captured and uploaded to Daughtry's official YouTube channel. The band also played the Dubai Jazz Festival in February 2013.\n\nOn April 20, 2013, bassist Todd Harrell was charged with [[vehicular homicide]] for his actions the night before in Nashville, Tennessee. He was reportedly driving on [[I-40]] at a high speed while under the influence of prescription medication when he caused an accident that killed 47-year-old Paul Howard Shoulders, Jr.  The judge in the trial granted the request by Harrell's lawyers to have Harrell placed on house arrest while awaiting trial.  The judge granted the defense request, but harshly criticized the musician's doctor in the courtroom, accusing the physician of prescribing Harrell far too many pain pills.  The judge stated that Harrell \"got 360 Oxycodone and 60 Oxycontin pills from his doctor in less than 30 days, which is well outside the amount that is usually prescribed in the due course of medical treatment.\"  Harrell was also charged with bringing a controlled substance into a correctional detention facility, after it was discovered during the booking process at Nashville's Metro Jail that Harrell had a plastic bag hidden in his sock that contained eight [[Xanax]] pills, twenty four [[Oxycodone]] pills, and four [[Oxymorphone]] pills. Harrell's court and trial dates have been repeatedly postponed by Harrell's attorneys for various reasons.  Harrell's original court dates of May 28 and 29, 2014 for the vehicular homicide charge were postponed and the court date for his previous DUI from 2012 was postponed since Harrell had voluntarily gone into rehab at an undisclosed location and remained there on the date set for the charge to go to court. In May 2014, the trial was moved to July 23, 2014.  The trial was again postponed by the judge at the request of Harrell's attorneys, pending a status hearing in September 2014.  A status hearing took place on September 19, 2014 for Harrell's vehicular homicide charge, in which the judge agreed to postpone the trial again and allow Harrell to remain on house arrest pending his trial.  As of January 2015, no trial date for the vehicular homicide charge had been set due to the multiple postponement requests by Harrell's attorneys, reportedly due to the fact that Harrell has been in rehab for treatment for addictions to alcohol and prescription pain medication. In December 2015, Harrell was sentenced to two years imprisonment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsmv.com/story/30789363/former-3-doors-down-bassist-sentenced-in-vehicular-homicide-case|title=Former 3 Doors Down bassist sentenced in vehicular homicide case|date=December 18, 2015|author=Sanders, Forrest|publisher=[[WSMV-TV]]|access-date=2017-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104234413/http://www.wsmv.com/story/30789363/former-3-doors-down-bassist-sentenced-in-vehicular-homicide-case|archive-date=2017-01-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> followed by six years of probation.\n\n3 Doors Down later announced that the four scheduled shows in the U.S. for April and May had been cancelled out of respect for Shoulders and his family.

From this basis, reflected upon all previous prophets through the lens of Muslim identity, Jesus is considered no more than a messenger repeating a repetitive message of the ages. The miracles of Jesus and the Quranic titles attributed to Jesus demonstrate the power of God rather than the divinity of Jesus \u2014 the same power behind the message of all prophets. Some Islamic traditions believe Jesus' mission was only to the people of Israel and his status as a prophet being confirmed by numerous miracles.<ref>Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 83.</ref><ref name=\"Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 90\"/>\n\nA second early high image of Jesus is an end-time figure. This concept arises mostly from the Hadith. Muslim tradition constructs a narrative similarly found in Christian theology, seeing Jesus arriving at the end of time and descending upon earth to fight the Antichrist. This narrative is understood to champion the cause of Islam, with some traditions narrating Jesus pointing to the primacy of Muhammad. Most traditions state Jesus will then die a natural death.<ref>Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 84.</ref>\n\nA third and distinctive image is of Jesus representing an ascetic figure \u2014 a prophet of the heart. Although the Quran refers to the \u2018gospel\u2019 of Jesus, those specific teachings of his are not mentioned in the Quran or later religious texts. They are largely absent. The Sufi tradition is where Jesus became revered, acknowledged as a spiritual teacher with a distinctive voice from other prophets, including Muhammad. Sufism tends to explore the dimensions of union with God through many approaches, including asceticism, poetry, philosophy, speculative suggestion, and mystical methods. Although Sufism to the Western mind may seem to share similar origins or elements of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, and Buddhism, the ideology is distinctly Islamic since they adhere to the words of the Quran and pursue imitation of Muhammad as the perfect man.<ref name=\"Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 85\">Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 85.</ref>\n\n===Preaching===\nThe Islamic concepts of Jesus' preaching is believed to have originated in [[Kufa]], Iraq, under the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] where the earliest writers of Muslim tradition and scholarship was formulated. The concepts of Jesus and his preaching ministry developed in Kufa was adopted from the early ascetic [[Arianism|Christians of Egypt]] who opposed official church bishopric appointments from Rome.<ref>{{cite book|last=Khalidi|first=Tarif|author-link=Tarif Khalidi|date=31 May 2001|title=The Muslim Jesus: Sayings and Stories in Islamic Literature|url=https://archive.org/details/muslimjesussayin00|url-access=registration|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/muslimjesussayin00/page/31 31]\u201336|isbn=978-0674004771}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest stories, numbering about 85, are found in two major collections of [[Asceticism|ascetic]] literature entitled ''Kitab al-Zuhd wa'l Raqa'iq'' (The Book of the Asceticism and Tender Mercies) by Ibn al-Mubarak (d. 797), and ''Kitab al-Zuhd'' (The Book of Asceticism) by Ibn Hanbal (d. 855). These sayings fall into four basic groups: a) eschatological sayings; b) quasi-Gospel sayings; c) ascetic sayings and stories; d) sayings echoing intra-Muslim polemics.<ref>Khalidi 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pE57rmPaM58C&printsec=fnd&pg=PA31 p. 31].</ref>\n\nThe first group of sayings expands Jesus' [[archetype]] as portrayed in the Quran. The second group of stories, although containing a Gospel core, are expanded with a ''\"distinctly Islamic stamp\"''. The third group, being the largest of the four, portrays Jesus as a patron saint of Muslim asceticism. The last group builds upon the Islamic archetype and Muslim-centric definition of Jesus and his attributes, furthering esoteric ideas regarding terms such as ''\"Spirit of God\"'' and ''\"Word of God\"''.<ref>Khalidi 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pE57rmPaM58C&printsec=fnd&pg=PA32 p. 32-36].</ref>\n\n==Miracles==\n{{main|Miracles of Jesus}}\n{{See also|Infancy Gospel of Thomas}}\nAt least six miracles are attributed to Jesus in the Quran, with many more being added over the centuries by writers and historians. Miracles were attributed to Jesus as signs of his prophethood and his authority, according to educator and professor Ishaq Musa Al-Husayni (d. 1990), an author most known for ''Mudhakkirat Dajaja (Memoirs of a Hen)'' (Cairo: Dar al-Maarif, 1943; 2nd ed. 1967). In ''Christ in the Quran and in Modern Arabic Literature (1960)'', Al-Husayni said it is noteworthy Muhammad attributes no miracles to himself.<ref name=\"Parrinder 1965, p. 83\">Parrinder 1965, p. 83.</ref>\n\nThese six miracles in the Quran are without detail unlike the Gospel and their non-canonical sources, which include details and mention other attributed miracles.<ref name=\"Parrinder 1965, p. 83\"/> Over the centuries, these six miracle narratives have been elaborated through Hadith and poetry, with religious writings including some of the other miracles mentioned in the Gospel, non-canonical sources, and from lore.<ref name=\"Leirvik 2010, p. 59-60\"/><ref name=\"Ayoub 1992, p. 145\"/>\n\n===Speaking from the cradle===\nSpeaking from the cradle is mentioned in three places in the Quran: al-Imran (3) 41, 46, al-Maida (5) 109-110 and Maryam (19) 29-30. Part of the narrative has the infant Jesus defending his mother Mary from the accusation of having given birth without a known husband.<ref name=\"Parrinder 1965, p. 78\">Parrinder 1965, p. 78.</ref> Early Islam was unclear about Joseph and his role. Jesus speaks as the angel Gabriel had mentioned at the annunciation: Jesus proclaims he is a servant of God, has been given a book, is a prophet, is blessed wherever he will go, blesses the day he was born, the day he will die, and the day he is raised alive.<ref>Parrinder 1965, p. 75-76.</ref>\n\nAlthough this particular narrative is not found in the [[Bible]], the theme of speaking from the cradle is found in the non-canonical pre-Islamic [[Syriac Infancy Gospel]]. That source has Jesus declaring himself the Son of God, the [[Logos|Word]], and affirming what the angel [[Gabriel]] had previously announced to Mary as detailed in the Gospel.<ref name=\"Parrinder 1965, p. 78\"/>\n\n===Creating birds from clay===\nThe miracle of creating birds from clay and breathing life into them when a child is mentioned in al-Imran (3) 43, 49 and al-Maida (5) 109-110. Although this miracle is also not mentioned the canonical Gospel, the same narrative is found in at least two pre-Islamic sources: the [[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]] and the Jewish [[Toledot Yeshu]], with few variant details between the Quran and these two sources.<ref name=\"Leirvik 2010, p. 60\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IEUdCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA60|title=Images of Jesus Christ in Islam: 2nd Edition|first=Oddbj\u00f8rn|last=Leirvik|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>Parrinder 1965, p. 83-84.</ref>\n\n===Healing the blind and the leper===\n{{See also|Healing the two blind men in Galilee|Cleansing ten lepers}}\nSimilar to the [[New Testament]], the Quran mentions Jesus healing the blind and the [[Leprosy|lepers]] in al-Imran (3) 49. Muslim scholar and judge [[al-Baydawi]] (d. 1286) wrote how it was recorded that many thousands of people came to Jesus to be healed, and that Jesus healed these diseases through prayer only.<ref>Parrinder 1965, p. 85.</ref> Medieval scholar [[al-Tha`labi]] wrote about how these two particular diseases were beyond medical help, and Jesus' miracles were meant to be witnessed by others as clear signs of his message.<ref name=\"Leirvik 2010, p. 60\"/>\n\n===Power over death===\nJesus is believed to have raised people from the dead, as mentioned in al-Imran (3) 49. Although no detail is given as to who was raised or the circumstance, at least three people are mentioned in detail in the Gospel (a [[Raising of Jairus' daughter|daughter]] of Jairus, a widow's [[Raising of the son of the widow of Nain|son]] at Nain, and [[Raising of Lazarus|Lazarus]]).<ref>Parrinder 1965, p. 86.</ref>\n\n===Prescience===\nJesus was able to [[Precognition|predict]], or had [[Prophecy|foreknowledge]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Fudge|first=Bruce|date=7 April 2011|title=Qur'anic Hermeneutics: Al-Tabrisi and the Craft of Commentary (Routledge Studies in the Qur'an)|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lWrLEup7pJcC&pg=PA60|location=United Kingdom|publisher=Routledge|page=60|isbn=978-0415782005}}</ref> of what was hidden or unknown to others. One example is Jesus would answer correctly any and every question anyone asked him. Another example is Jesus knew what people had just eaten, as well as what they had stored in their homes.<ref name=\"Leirvik 2010, p. 59-60\"/>\n\n===Table of food from heaven===\n{{Main|Feeding the multitude}}\n{{See also|Last Supper}}\nIn the fifth chapter of the Quran, [[al-Maida (5)]] 112-115, a narration mentions the disciples of Jesus requesting a table laden with food, and for it to be a special day of commemoration for them in the future. This may be a possible reference to the [[Eucharist]] according to professor of Islamic and Arabic studies [[W. Montgomery Watt]] (d. 2006).<ref name=\"Watt 1991, p. 24\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&printsec=fnd&pg=PA24|title=Muslim-Christian Encounters (Routledge Revivals): Perceptions and Misperceptions|first=William Montgomery|last=Watt|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}</ref> According to professor of comparative religions [[Geoffrey Parrinder]] (d. 2005), it is unclear if this story parallels the Gospel's [[Last Supper]] or the [[feeding the multitude]], but may be tied to the Arabic word ''\u02bf\u012bd'' (Muslim festival):<ref>Parrinder 1965, p. 87.</ref>\n\n{{Quote| ''\"One time the disciples said, O Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord send down for us a table from heaven? He said, Fear God, if you are believers. They said, We want to eat of it, and that our hearts may be at peace, and we may know you have spoken truthfully and be among the witnesses to it. Jesus, son of Mary, said, O God our Lord send down upon us a table from heaven, to be for us a festival, for the first of us and the last of us, and a sign from you: and give provision (of food) to us, for you are the best of providers.

Therefore, Jesus invited his disciples for a last supper. After the meal, he washed their hands and performed their ablutions to wipe their hands on his clothing. Afterwards Jesus replied to them: \"As for that I have done to you tonight, in that I served you the meal and washed your hands in person, let it be an example for you. Since you indeed consider me to be better than you, do not be haughty in relation to each other but rather expand yourselve for each other as I have expanded myself for you.\" After instructing the disciples in his teachings, Jesus foretells that one of them would deny him and another betray him. However, in accordance with Islamic denial of crucifixion, just a corpse in semblance of Jesus was caught and crucified and Jesus himself was raised to God.<ref>Neal Robinson ''Christ in Islam and Christianity'' SUNY Press 1991 {{ISBN|978-0-791-40558-1}} p 129</ref>\n\n===Other miracles===\nMany stories and narratives have been developed over the years about Jesus, containing certain inherent lessons or providing meaning due to the lack of detail in the Quran regarding Jesus. Some of these narratives are similar in nature to the [[New Testament]], while some portray Jesus in a very human manner.\n\nBesides some detail summaries of miracles of Jesus mentioned by Muslim writers over the centuries, from adulthood (like walking on water - also found in the Gospel - and causing loaves of bread to come from the ground),<ref name=\"Parrinder 1965, p. 78\"/> some other miracles from childhood include: explaining the Muslim creed fundamentals to a schoolmaster, revealing who the thieves were to a wealthy chief, filling empty jars of something to drink, providing food and wine for a tyrannical king while also proving to this king his power in raising a dead man from the dead, raising a child accidentally killed, and causing the garments from a single-colored vat to come out with various colors.<ref name=\"Leirvik 2010, p. 59-60\"/>\n\n====Healing a royal official's son====\n{{Main|Healing the royal official's son}}\nAl-Tabari (d. 923) reports a story of an adult Jesus' encounter with a certain king in the region and the healing of his son.

As a result, the parents kept their children away from Jesus and gathered their children into a single house. One day, feeling lonely, Jesus went out looking for his friends, and coming upon this house he asked the parents where their children were. The parents responded that the children were not there [lied]. After Jesus asks who, then, is in the house, the parents call Jesus a pig. Jesus then says 'let there be swine in this house' which turns all the children into swine.<ref name=\"Ayoub 1992\">{{cite book|last=Ayoub|first=Mahmoud|author-link=Mahmoud M.

The Quran speaks favorably of ''al-Inj\u012bl'', which it describes as a scripture that fills the hearts of its followers with meekness and piety.

While not naming the disciples, the Quran does give a few instances of Jesus preaching the message to them. According to Christianity, the names of the twelve disciples were [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[John the Apostle|John]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], [[Bartholomew]], [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]], [[James, son of Alphaeus|James]], [[Jude the Apostle|Jude]], [[Simon the Zealot|Simon]] and [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]].\n\nThe Quran mentions in chapter 3, verses 52-53, that the disciples submitted to the faith of Islam:{{primary source inline|date=July 2017}}\n{{quote|When Jesus found Unbelief on their part He said: \"Who will be My helpers to (the work of) Allah?\" Said the disciples: \"We are Allah's helpers: We believe in Allah, and do thou bear witness that we are Muslims.<br>Our Lord! we believe in what Thou hast revealed, and we follow the Messenger; then write us down among those who bear witness.\"|''Quran Surah Al-Imran 52-53''<ref>{{Cite quran|3|52|e=53|s=ns}}</ref>}} \nThe longest narrative involving Jesus' disciples is when Jesus performs the miracle of bringing a table of food from heaven at their request, for further proof that his preaching is the true message.\n\n==Death==\n{{Main|Islamic view of Jesus' death}}\nMost Islamic traditions, save for a few, categorically deny that Jesus physically died, either on a cross or another manner. The contention is found within the Islamic traditions themselves, with the earliest Hadith reports quoting the companions of Muhammad stating Jesus having died, while the majority of subsequent Hadith and Tafsir argue in favor of the denial through exegesis and apologetics, becoming the popular (orthodox) view.\n\nProfessor and scholar [[Mahmoud M. Ayoub]] sums up what the Quran states despite interpretative arguments:\n\n{{quote|''\"The Quran, as we have already argued, does not deny the death of Christ.

Ayoub furthers what modern scholars of Islam interpret regarding the historical death of Jesus, the man, as man's inability to kill off God's Word and the Spirit of God, which the Quran testifies were embodied in Jesus Christ. Ayoub continues highlighting the denial of the killing of Jesus as God denying men such power to vanquish and destroy the divine Word.

(They are) the community (''[[ummah|umma]]'') of the Christ, Jesus, son of Mary (peace upon him). He is who was truly sent (as prophet; ''mab'uth'') after Moses (peace upon him), and who was announced in the Torah. To him were (granted) manifest signs and notable evidences, such as the reviving of the dead and the curing of the blind and the leper. His very nature and innate disposition (''[[fitra]]'') are a perfect sign of his truthfulness; that is, his coming without previous seed and his speaking without prior teaching. For all the (other) prophets the arrival of their revelation was at (the age of) forty years, but revelation came to him when he was made to speak in the cradle, and revelation came to him when he conveyed (the divine message) at (the age of) thirty.

The religion of Jesus was 'tawhid' (divine unity), 'ikhlas' (purity) and what Noah, Abraham and Moses had professed. The 'Injil' (Gospel) was sent down to him and the pledge that other prophets took was also taken from Jesus: to establish prayer with religion, enjoin the good and forbid the evil, allowing what is allowed and forbidding what has been forbidden. Admonitions and parables were sent down to him in the 'Injil', but there was no law of retribution in it nor precepts of retribution (ahkam al-hudud), and no obligations for inheritance. He was sent what was an alleviation of what was sent down to Moses in the Torah.

Muhammad is revered in part because he promoted the right blend of justice and mercy. In other words, Muslims need both a path that addresses individual spirituality as well as a path that will address the complex issues of community life, law, justice, etc. Jesus is viewed by many Muslims as having lived out only one side of this equation. As a figure of the heart or individual conscience, Jesus is viewed by some to be a limited figure. In more critical Muslim perspectives the Sermon on the Mount is admired but seen as impractical for human society. Perhaps the greatest division amongst Muslims has to do with the relevance of ascetic and esoteric beliefs in the context of strengthening an Islamic society.\"''<ref name=\"Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 86\"/>}}\n\nThe miraculous birth and life of Jesus becomes a metaphor for [[Rumi]] of the spiritual rebirth that is possible within each human soul. This rebirth is not achieved without effort; one needs to practice silence, poverty, and fasting\u2014themes that were prominent in Jesus\u2019 life according to Islamic traditions.<ref>Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 112.</ref>\n\n[[Ibn Arabi]] stated Jesus was [[Al-Ins\u0101n al-K\u0101mil]], the spirit and simultaneously a servant of God. Jesus is held to be \"one with God\" in whole coincidence of will, not as a being. Due to the spirit of God dwelling in Jesus, God spoke and acted through him. Yet Jesus is not considered to be God, but a person within God's word and spirit and a manifestation of God's attributes, like a mirror.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IEUdCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA89|title=Images of Jesus Christ in Islam: 2nd Edition|first=Oddbj\u00f8rn|last=Leirvik|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9781441186621}}</ref><ref>Clinton Bennett ''Understanding Christian-Muslim Relations: Past and Present'' A&C Black 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-826-48782-7}} page 155</ref>\n\n===Ascetic literature===\nJesus is widely venerated in Muslim [[Asceticism|ascetic]] and [[mysticism|mystic]] literature, such as in Muslim mystic [[Ghazali|Al-Ghazzali]]'s ''Ihya `ulum ad-Din'' (\"The revival of the religious sciences\"). These works lay stress upon Jesus' poverty, his preoccupation with worship, his detachment from worldly life and his miracles. Such depictions also include advice and sermons which are attributed to him. Later [[Sufism|Sufic]] commentaries adapted material from Christian gospels which were consistent with their ascetic portrayal. Sufi philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] described Jesus as \"the seal of universal holiness\" due to the quality of his faith and \"because he holds in his hands the keys of living breath and because he is at present in a state of deprivation and journeying\".<ref name=\"EoI-Isa\"/>{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe [[Gospel of Barnabas]], which is generally agreed to correspond with the one found in the two known manuscripts and is reported to be contained in [[Morisco]] manuscript BNM MS 9653 in [[Madrid]], claims that Jesus predicted the advent of [[Muhammad]].

From this basis, reflected upon all previous prophets through the lens of Muslim identity, Jesus is considered no more than a messenger repeating a repetitive message of the ages. The miracles of Jesus and the Quranic titles attributed to Jesus demonstrate the power of God rather than the divinity of Jesus \u2014 the same power behind the message of all prophets. Some Islamic traditions believe Jesus' mission was only to the people of Israel and his status as a prophet being confirmed by numerous miracles.<ref>Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 83.</ref><ref name=\"Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 90\"/>\n\nA second early high image of Jesus is an end-time figure. This concept arises mostly from the Hadith. Muslim tradition constructs a narrative similarly found in Christian theology, seeing Jesus arriving at the end of time and descending upon earth to fight the Antichrist. This narrative is understood to champion the cause of Islam, with some traditions narrating Jesus pointing to the primacy of Muhammad. Most traditions state Jesus will then die a natural death.<ref>Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 84.</ref>\n\nA third and distinctive image is of Jesus representing an ascetic figure \u2014 a prophet of the heart. Although the Quran refers to the \u2018gospel\u2019 of Jesus, those specific teachings of his are not mentioned in the Quran or later religious texts. They are largely absent. The Sufi tradition is where Jesus became revered, acknowledged as a spiritual teacher with a distinctive voice from other prophets, including Muhammad. Sufism tends to explore the dimensions of union with God through many approaches, including asceticism, poetry, philosophy, speculative suggestion, and mystical methods. Although Sufism to the Western mind may seem to share similar origins or elements of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, and Buddhism, the ideology is distinctly Islamic since they adhere to the words of the Quran and pursue imitation of Muhammad as the perfect man.<ref name=\"Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 85\">Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 85.</ref>\n\n===Preaching===\nThe Islamic concepts of Jesus' preaching is believed to have originated in [[Kufa]], Iraq, under the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] where the earliest writers of Muslim tradition and scholarship was formulated. The concepts of Jesus and his preaching ministry developed in Kufa was adopted from the early ascetic [[Arianism|Christians of Egypt]] who opposed official church bishopric appointments from Rome.<ref>{{cite book|last=Khalidi|first=Tarif|author-link=Tarif Khalidi|date=31 May 2001|title=The Muslim Jesus: Sayings and Stories in Islamic Literature|url=https://archive.org/details/muslimjesussayin00|url-access=registration|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/muslimjesussayin00/page/31 31]\u201336|isbn=978-0674004771}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest stories, numbering about 85, are found in two major collections of [[Asceticism|ascetic]] literature entitled ''Kitab al-Zuhd wa'l Raqa'iq'' (The Book of the Asceticism and Tender Mercies) by Ibn al-Mubarak (d. 797), and ''Kitab al-Zuhd'' (The Book of Asceticism) by Ibn Hanbal (d. 855). These sayings fall into four basic groups: a) eschatological sayings; b) quasi-Gospel sayings; c) ascetic sayings and stories; d) sayings echoing intra-Muslim polemics.<ref>Khalidi 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pE57rmPaM58C&printsec=fnd&pg=PA31 p. 31].</ref>\n\nThe first group of sayings expands Jesus' [[archetype]] as portrayed in the Quran. The second group of stories, although containing a Gospel core, are expanded with a ''\"distinctly Islamic stamp\"''. The third group, being the largest of the four, portrays Jesus as a patron saint of Muslim asceticism. The last group builds upon the Islamic archetype and Muslim-centric definition of Jesus and his attributes, furthering esoteric ideas regarding terms such as ''\"Spirit of God\"'' and ''\"Word of God\"''.<ref>Khalidi 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pE57rmPaM58C&printsec=fnd&pg=PA32 p. 32-36].</ref>\n\n==Miracles==\n{{main|Miracles of Jesus}}\n{{See also|Infancy Gospel of Thomas}}\nAt least six miracles are attributed to Jesus in the Quran, with many more being added over the centuries by writers and historians. Miracles were attributed to Jesus as signs of his prophethood and his authority, according to educator and professor Ishaq Musa Al-Husayni (d. 1990), an author most known for ''Mudhakkirat Dajaja (Memoirs of a Hen)'' (Cairo: Dar al-Maarif, 1943; 2nd ed. 1967). In ''Christ in the Quran and in Modern Arabic Literature (1960)'', Al-Husayni said it is noteworthy Muhammad attributes no miracles to himself.<ref name=\"Parrinder 1965, p. 83\">Parrinder 1965, p. 83.</ref>\n\nThese six miracles in the Quran are without detail unlike the Gospel and their non-canonical sources, which include details and mention other attributed miracles.<ref name=\"Parrinder 1965, p. 83\"/> Over the centuries, these six miracle narratives have been elaborated through Hadith and poetry, with religious writings including some of the other miracles mentioned in the Gospel, non-canonical sources, and from lore.<ref name=\"Leirvik 2010, p. 59-60\"/><ref name=\"Ayoub 1992, p. 145\"/>\n\n===Speaking from the cradle===\nSpeaking from the cradle is mentioned in three places in the Quran: al-Imran (3) 41, 46, al-Maida (5) 109-110 and Maryam (19) 29-30. Part of the narrative has the infant Jesus defending his mother Mary from the accusation of having given birth without a known husband.<ref name=\"Parrinder 1965, p. 78\">Parrinder 1965, p. 78.</ref> Early Islam was unclear about Joseph and his role. Jesus speaks as the angel Gabriel had mentioned at the annunciation: Jesus proclaims he is a servant of God, has been given a book, is a prophet, is blessed wherever he will go, blesses the day he was born, the day he will die, and the day he is raised alive.<ref>Parrinder 1965, p. 75-76.</ref>\n\nAlthough this particular narrative is not found in the [[Bible]], the theme of speaking from the cradle is found in the non-canonical pre-Islamic [[Syriac Infancy Gospel]]. That source has Jesus declaring himself the Son of God, the [[Logos|Word]], and affirming what the angel [[Gabriel]] had previously announced to Mary as detailed in the Gospel.<ref name=\"Parrinder 1965, p. 78\"/>\n\n===Creating birds from clay===\nThe miracle of creating birds from clay and breathing life into them when a child is mentioned in al-Imran (3) 43, 49 and al-Maida (5) 109-110. Although this miracle is also not mentioned the canonical Gospel, the same narrative is found in at least two pre-Islamic sources: the [[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]] and the Jewish [[Toledot Yeshu]], with few variant details between the Quran and these two sources.<ref name=\"Leirvik 2010, p. 60\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IEUdCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA60|title=Images of Jesus Christ in Islam: 2nd Edition|first=Oddbj\u00f8rn|last=Leirvik|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>Parrinder 1965, p. 83-84.</ref>\n\n===Healing the blind and the leper===\n{{See also|Healing the two blind men in Galilee|Cleansing ten lepers}}\nSimilar to the [[New Testament]], the Quran mentions Jesus healing the blind and the [[Leprosy|lepers]] in al-Imran (3) 49. Muslim scholar and judge [[al-Baydawi]] (d. 1286) wrote how it was recorded that many thousands of people came to Jesus to be healed, and that Jesus healed these diseases through prayer only.<ref>Parrinder 1965, p. 85.</ref> Medieval scholar [[al-Tha`labi]] wrote about how these two particular diseases were beyond medical help, and Jesus' miracles were meant to be witnessed by others as clear signs of his message.<ref name=\"Leirvik 2010, p. 60\"/>\n\n===Power over death===\nJesus is believed to have raised people from the dead, as mentioned in al-Imran (3) 49. Although no detail is given as to who was raised or the circumstance, at least three people are mentioned in detail in the Gospel (a [[Raising of Jairus' daughter|daughter]] of Jairus, a widow's [[Raising of the son of the widow of Nain|son]] at Nain, and [[Raising of Lazarus|Lazarus]]).<ref>Parrinder 1965, p. 86.</ref>\n\n===Prescience===\nJesus was able to [[Precognition|predict]], or had [[Prophecy|foreknowledge]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Fudge|first=Bruce|date=7 April 2011|title=Qur'anic Hermeneutics: Al-Tabrisi and the Craft of Commentary (Routledge Studies in the Qur'an)|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lWrLEup7pJcC&pg=PA60|location=United Kingdom|publisher=Routledge|page=60|isbn=978-0415782005}}</ref> of what was hidden or unknown to others. One example is Jesus would answer correctly any and every question anyone asked him. Another example is Jesus knew what people had just eaten, as well as what they had stored in their homes.<ref name=\"Leirvik 2010, p. 59-60\"/>\n\n===Table of food from heaven===\n{{Main|Feeding the multitude}}\n{{See also|Last Supper}}\nIn the fifth chapter of the Quran, [[al-Maida (5)]] 112-115, a narration mentions the disciples of Jesus requesting a table laden with food, and for it to be a special day of commemoration for them in the future. This may be a possible reference to the [[Eucharist]] according to professor of Islamic and Arabic studies [[W. Montgomery Watt]] (d. 2006).<ref name=\"Watt 1991, p. 24\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&printsec=fnd&pg=PA24|title=Muslim-Christian Encounters (Routledge Revivals): Perceptions and Misperceptions|first=William Montgomery|last=Watt|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}</ref> According to professor of comparative religions [[Geoffrey Parrinder]] (d. 2005), it is unclear if this story parallels the Gospel's [[Last Supper]] or the [[feeding the multitude]], but may be tied to the Arabic word ''\u02bf\u012bd'' (Muslim festival):<ref>Parrinder 1965, p. 87.</ref>\n\n{{Quote| ''\"One time the disciples said, O Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord send down for us a table from heaven? He said, Fear God, if you are believers. They said, We want to eat of it, and that our hearts may be at peace, and we may know you have spoken truthfully and be among the witnesses to it. Jesus, son of Mary, said, O God our Lord send down upon us a table from heaven, to be for us a festival, for the first of us and the last of us, and a sign from you: and give provision (of food) to us, for you are the best of providers.

Therefore, Jesus invited his disciples for a last supper. After the meal, he washed their hands and performed their ablutions to wipe their hands on his clothing. Afterwards Jesus replied to them: \"As for that I have done to you tonight, in that I served you the meal and washed your hands in person, let it be an example for you. Since you indeed consider me to be better than you, do not be haughty in relation to each other but rather expand yourselve for each other as I have expanded myself for you.\" After instructing the disciples in his teachings, Jesus foretells that one of them would deny him and another betray him. However, in accordance with Islamic denial of crucifixion, just a corpse in semblance of Jesus was caught and crucified and Jesus himself was raised to God.<ref>Neal Robinson ''Christ in Islam and Christianity'' SUNY Press 1991 {{ISBN|978-0-791-40558-1}} p 129</ref>\n\n===Other miracles===\nMany stories and narratives have been developed over the years about Jesus, containing certain inherent lessons or providing meaning due to the lack of detail in the Quran regarding Jesus. Some of these narratives are similar in nature to the [[New Testament]], while some portray Jesus in a very human manner.\n\nBesides some detail summaries of miracles of Jesus mentioned by Muslim writers over the centuries, from adulthood (like walking on water - also found in the Gospel - and causing loaves of bread to come from the ground),<ref name=\"Parrinder 1965, p. 78\"/> some other miracles from childhood include: explaining the Muslim creed fundamentals to a schoolmaster, revealing who the thieves were to a wealthy chief, filling empty jars of something to drink, providing food and wine for a tyrannical king while also proving to this king his power in raising a dead man from the dead, raising a child accidentally killed, and causing the garments from a single-colored vat to come out with various colors.<ref name=\"Leirvik 2010, p. 59-60\"/>\n\n====Healing a royal official's son====\n{{Main|Healing the royal official's son}}\nAl-Tabari (d. 923) reports a story of an adult Jesus' encounter with a certain king in the region and the healing of his son.

As a result, the parents kept their children away from Jesus and gathered their children into a single house. One day, feeling lonely, Jesus went out looking for his friends, and coming upon this house he asked the parents where their children were. The parents responded that the children were not there [lied]. After Jesus asks who, then, is in the house, the parents call Jesus a pig. Jesus then says 'let there be swine in this house' which turns all the children into swine.<ref name=\"Ayoub 1992\">{{cite book|last=Ayoub|first=Mahmoud|author-link=Mahmoud M.

The Quran speaks favorably of ''al-Inj\u012bl'', which it describes as a scripture that fills the hearts of its followers with meekness and piety.

While not naming the disciples, the Quran does give a few instances of Jesus preaching the message to them. According to Christianity, the names of the twelve disciples were [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[John the Apostle|John]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], [[Bartholomew]], [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]], [[James, son of Alphaeus|James]], [[Jude the Apostle|Jude]], [[Simon the Zealot|Simon]] and [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]].\n\nThe Quran mentions in chapter 3, verses 52-53, that the disciples submitted to the faith of Islam:{{primary source inline|date=July 2017}}\n{{quote|When Jesus found Unbelief on their part He said: \"Who will be My helpers to (the work of) Allah?\" Said the disciples: \"We are Allah's helpers: We believe in Allah, and do thou bear witness that we are Muslims.<br>Our Lord! we believe in what Thou hast revealed, and we follow the Messenger; then write us down among those who bear witness.\"|''Quran Surah Al-Imran 52-53''<ref>{{Cite quran|3|52|e=53|s=ns}}</ref>}} \nThe longest narrative involving Jesus' disciples is when Jesus performs the miracle of bringing a table of food from heaven at their request, for further proof that his preaching is the true message.\n\n==Death==\n{{Main|Islamic view of Jesus' death}}\nMost Islamic traditions, save for a few, categorically deny that Jesus physically died, either on a cross or another manner. The contention is found within the Islamic traditions themselves, with the earliest Hadith reports quoting the companions of Muhammad stating Jesus having died, while the majority of subsequent Hadith and Tafsir argue in favor of the denial through exegesis and apologetics, becoming the popular (orthodox) view.\n\nProfessor and scholar [[Mahmoud M. Ayoub]] sums up what the Quran states despite interpretative arguments:\n\n{{quote|''\"The Quran, as we have already argued, does not deny the death of Christ.

Ayoub furthers what modern scholars of Islam interpret regarding the historical death of Jesus, the man, as man's inability to kill off God's Word and the Spirit of God, which the Quran testifies were embodied in Jesus Christ. Ayoub continues highlighting the denial of the killing of Jesus as God denying men such power to vanquish and destroy the divine Word.

(They are) the community (''[[ummah|umma]]'') of the Christ, Jesus, son of Mary (peace upon him). He is who was truly sent (as prophet; ''mab'uth'') after Moses (peace upon him), and who was announced in the Torah. To him were (granted) manifest signs and notable evidences, such as the reviving of the dead and the curing of the blind and the leper. His very nature and innate disposition (''[[fitra]]'') are a perfect sign of his truthfulness; that is, his coming without previous seed and his speaking without prior teaching. For all the (other) prophets the arrival of their revelation was at (the age of) forty years, but revelation came to him when he was made to speak in the cradle, and revelation came to him when he conveyed (the divine message) at (the age of) thirty.

The religion of Jesus was 'tawhid' (divine unity), 'ikhlas' (purity) and what Noah, Abraham and Moses had professed. The 'Injil' (Gospel) was sent down to him and the pledge that other prophets took was also taken from Jesus: to establish prayer with religion, enjoin the good and forbid the evil, allowing what is allowed and forbidding what has been forbidden. Admonitions and parables were sent down to him in the 'Injil', but there was no law of retribution in it nor precepts of retribution (ahkam al-hudud), and no obligations for inheritance. He was sent what was an alleviation of what was sent down to Moses in the Torah.

Muhammad is revered in part because he promoted the right blend of justice and mercy. In other words, Muslims need both a path that addresses individual spirituality as well as a path that will address the complex issues of community life, law, justice, etc. Jesus is viewed by many Muslims as having lived out only one side of this equation. As a figure of the heart or individual conscience, Jesus is viewed by some to be a limited figure. In more critical Muslim perspectives the Sermon on the Mount is admired but seen as impractical for human society. Perhaps the greatest division amongst Muslims has to do with the relevance of ascetic and esoteric beliefs in the context of strengthening an Islamic society.\"''<ref name=\"Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 86\"/>}}\n\nThe miraculous birth and life of Jesus becomes a metaphor for [[Rumi]] of the spiritual rebirth that is possible within each human soul. This rebirth is not achieved without effort; one needs to practice silence, poverty, and fasting\u2014themes that were prominent in Jesus\u2019 life according to Islamic traditions.<ref>Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 112.</ref>\n\n[[Ibn Arabi]] stated Jesus was [[Al-Ins\u0101n al-K\u0101mil]], the spirit and simultaneously a servant of God. Jesus is held to be \"one with God\" in whole coincidence of will, not as a being. Due to the spirit of God dwelling in Jesus, God spoke and acted through him. Yet Jesus is not considered to be God, but a person within God's word and spirit and a manifestation of God's attributes, like a mirror.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IEUdCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA89|title=Images of Jesus Christ in Islam: 2nd Edition|first=Oddbj\u00f8rn|last=Leirvik|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9781441186621}}</ref><ref>Clinton Bennett ''Understanding Christian-Muslim Relations: Past and Present'' A&C Black 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-826-48782-7}} page 155</ref>\n\n===Ascetic literature===\nJesus is widely venerated in Muslim [[Asceticism|ascetic]] and [[mysticism|mystic]] literature, such as in Muslim mystic [[Ghazali|Al-Ghazzali]]'s ''Ihya `ulum ad-Din'' (\"The revival of the religious sciences\"). These works lay stress upon Jesus' poverty, his preoccupation with worship, his detachment from worldly life and his miracles. Such depictions also include advice and sermons which are attributed to him. Later [[Sufism|Sufic]] commentaries adapted material from Christian gospels which were consistent with their ascetic portrayal. Sufi philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] described Jesus as \"the seal of universal holiness\" due to the quality of his faith and \"because he holds in his hands the keys of living breath and because he is at present in a state of deprivation and journeying\".<ref name=\"EoI-Isa\"/>{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe [[Gospel of Barnabas]], which is generally agreed to correspond with the one found in the two known manuscripts and is reported to be contained in [[Morisco]] manuscript BNM MS 9653 in [[Madrid]], claims that Jesus predicted the advent of [[Muhammad]].

people into their Union Square store in [[New York City]], March 18, 2020]]\n=== Lack of enforcement of self-quarantine policies ===\nSelf-quarantines for persons who test positive or are symptomatic are not enforced due to a lack of resources. Several New York City area nurses have expressed concerns that patients are not complying with self-quarantine guidelines due to financial necessity or fear of losing their jobs. A New York State Nurses Association board member has expressed concerns that low-income patients who share rooms with other individuals may not be able to effectively self-isolate at their residences.<ref>{{cite news|title=NYC nurses fear many coronavirus patients can't afford to self-quarantine|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-nurses-fear-patients-not-self-quarantining-20200324-rd5x2xa3gzc3nhmv3e36u5n3iu-story.html|date=March 24, 2020|work=Daily News}}</ref>\n\n=== Difficulties of implementation in Hasidic communities ===\nImplementing social distancing has been especially difficult in some communities dominated by [[Hasidic Jews]]. The [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] village of [[Kiryas Joel, New York|Kiryas Joel]], home to 25,000 [[Satmar Hasidim]], closed all 100 of its synagogues, as well as schools and ''[[mikvah]]''s on March 19, despite the centrality of religious observance in the community. It is estimated that 25\u201328 percent of its residents have tested positive, including the community's spiritual leader, Grand Rebbe [[Aaron Teitelbaum]].<ref name=\"Ha'aretz article\">{{cite news|last=Ziri|first=Danielle|url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-in-america-s-only-orthodox-town-the-coronavirus-brings-unique-problems-1.8710123|title=In America's Only Orthodox Town, Coronavirus Poses Unique Challenge for Insular Jewish Community|date=March 25, 2020|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> On March 27 the county reported that Kiryas Joel, as the town of Palm Tree, had 234 confirmed cases, the most of any municipality in the county.<ref>{{cite web|title=COVID-19/Coronavirus|url=https://www.orangecountygov.com/1936/Coronavirus|publisher=[[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] Department of Health|date=March 27, 2020|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome other reports have suggested that the Hasidic community has generally been slow to implement measures designed to slow the spread of the virus. This has reportedly led to one [[antisemitism in the United States|antisemitic]] incident. On March 23 a car dealership near Kiryas Joel refused to service a resident's car, telling him he had the virus.<ref name=\"Forward article\">{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Ari|url=https://forward.com/news/national/442285/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-trump-doctor/|title=This doctor was already treating patients with Trump's 'gift from God' drug - before FDA approval|date=March 24, 2020|newspaper=[[The Forward]]|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] physician, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, who sees patients at his offices in both Kiryas Joel and [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], another predominantly Hasidic community in nearby [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], claims that the real infection rate in Kiryas Joel is much higher, claims that have been disputed by local authorities. Zelenko, who must self-isolate since he is missing a lung, says in daily [[YouTube]] videos he posts that he has treated 500 patients (mostly in Kiryas Joel) for COVID-19, using the combination of [[hydroxychloroquine]] and [[azithromycin]] or [[zinc sulfate]], which has in some trials yielded positive results in reducing symptoms.

people into their Union Square store in [[New York City]], March 18, 2020]]\n=== Lack of enforcement of self-quarantine policies ===\nSelf-quarantines for persons who test positive or are symptomatic are not enforced due to a lack of resources. Several New York City area nurses have expressed concerns that patients are not complying with self-quarantine guidelines due to financial necessity or fear of losing their jobs. A New York State Nurses Association board member has expressed concerns that low-income patients who share rooms with other individuals may not be able to effectively self-isolate at their residences.<ref>{{cite news|title=NYC nurses fear many coronavirus patients can't afford to self-quarantine|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-nurses-fear-patients-not-self-quarantining-20200324-rd5x2xa3gzc3nhmv3e36u5n3iu-story.html|date=March 24, 2020|work=Daily News}}</ref>\n\n=== Difficulties of implementation in Hasidic communities ===\nImplementing social distancing has been especially difficult in some communities dominated by [[Hasidic Jews]]. The [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] village of [[Kiryas Joel, New York|Kiryas Joel]], home to 25,000 [[Satmar Hasidim]], closed all 100 of its synagogues, as well as schools and ''[[mikvah]]''s on March 19, despite the centrality of religious observance in the community. It is estimated that 25\u201328 percent of its residents have tested positive, including the community's spiritual leader, Grand Rebbe [[Aaron Teitelbaum]].<ref name=\"Ha'aretz article\">{{cite news|last=Ziri|first=Danielle|url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-in-america-s-only-orthodox-town-the-coronavirus-brings-unique-problems-1.8710123|title=In America's Only Orthodox Town, Coronavirus Poses Unique Challenge for Insular Jewish Community|date=March 25, 2020|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> On March 27 the county reported that Kiryas Joel, as the town of Palm Tree, had 234 confirmed cases, the most of any municipality in the county.<ref>{{cite web|title=COVID-19/Coronavirus|url=https://www.orangecountygov.com/1936/Coronavirus|publisher=[[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] Department of Health|date=March 27, 2020|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome other reports have suggested that the Hasidic community has generally been slow to implement measures designed to slow the spread of the virus. This has reportedly led to one [[antisemitism in the United States|antisemitic]] incident. On March 23 a car dealership near Kiryas Joel refused to service a resident's car, telling him he had the virus.<ref name=\"Forward article\">{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Ari|url=https://forward.com/news/national/442285/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-trump-doctor/|title=This doctor was already treating patients with Trump's 'gift from God' drug - before FDA approval|date=March 24, 2020|newspaper=[[The Forward]]|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] physician, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, who sees patients at his offices in both Kiryas Joel and [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], another predominantly Hasidic community in nearby [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], claims that the real infection rate in Kiryas Joel is much higher, claims that have been disputed by local authorities. Zelenko, who must self-isolate since he is missing a lung, says in daily [[YouTube]] videos he posts that he has treated 500 patients (mostly in Kiryas Joel) for COVID-19, using the combination of [[hydroxychloroquine]] and [[azithromycin]] or [[zinc sulfate]], which has in some trials yielded positive results in reducing symptoms.

Disston had contracted with the financially wobbly state of Florida to drain its southern lands, for which he would own half of all he successfully drained. This deal made Disston the largest single landowner in the United States.\n\nDisston's [[dredging]] and [[land speculation]] required a small [[steamboat]] industry to transport people and goods along the new waterway. The Kissimmee [[shipyard]] was responsible for building most of these large steamships, which were just one jump ahead of civilization\u2014with Kissimmee as the jumping off point. Concurrently, the [[South Florida Railroad]] was growing and extended the end of its line from [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]] down to Kissimmee, making the town on [[Lake Tohopekaliga]] a [[transportation hub]] for [[Central Florida]]. On February 12, 1885, the [[Florida Legislature]] incorporated the [[Kissimmee City Street Railway]].\n\n[[File:Kissimmee Automobile Company.jpg|thumb|Kissimmee Automobile Company, 1910s]]\n\nBut the heyday of Kissimmee was short-lived. Expanding [[railroad]]s began to challenge the steamships for carrying [[freight]] and passengers. By 1884, the South Florida Railroad, now part of the [[Plant System]], had extended its tracks to [[Tampa]]. The [[Panic of 1893]] was the worst [[Depression (economics)|depression]] the U.S. had experienced up to that time, crushing land speculation and unsound [[debt]]. Hamilton Disston closed his Kissimmee land operation. Consecutive freezes in 1894 and 1895 wiped out the [[citrus]] industry. The freezes, combined with [[South Florida]]'s growth and the relocation of steamship operations to [[Lake Okeechobee]], left Kissimmee dependent on [[open range]] [[cattle ranching]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Octogenarian Still Loves Quarter Horses And A Good Rodeo|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-12-12/news/9312110860_1_horses-roberts-was-born-campbell-station|date=December 12, 1993|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Cowman\">{{cite news|title=A Cattleman for All Seasons Development Can't Fence In Tommy Reaves' Love For The Land|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-07-04/features/9006280673_1_reaves-herd-cattle|date=July 4, 1990|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nKissimmee had a population of 4,310 in 1950.

Disston had contracted with the financially wobbly state of Florida to drain its southern lands, for which he would own half of all he successfully drained. This deal made Disston the largest single landowner in the United States.\n\nDisston's [[dredging]] and [[land speculation]] required a small [[steamboat]] industry to transport people and goods along the new waterway. The Kissimmee [[shipyard]] was responsible for building most of these large steamships, which were just one jump ahead of civilization\u2014with Kissimmee as the jumping off point. Concurrently, the [[South Florida Railroad]] was growing and extended the end of its line from [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]] down to Kissimmee, making the town on [[Lake Tohopekaliga]] a [[transportation hub]] for [[Central Florida]]. On February 12, 1885, the [[Florida Legislature]] incorporated the [[Kissimmee City Street Railway]].\n\n[[File:Kissimmee Automobile Company.jpg|thumb|Kissimmee Automobile Company, 1910s]]\n\nBut the heyday of Kissimmee was short-lived. Expanding [[railroad]]s began to challenge the steamships for carrying [[freight]] and passengers. By 1884, the South Florida Railroad, now part of the [[Plant System]], had extended its tracks to [[Tampa]]. The [[Panic of 1893]] was the worst [[Depression (economics)|depression]] the U.S. had experienced up to that time, crushing land speculation and unsound [[debt]]. Hamilton Disston closed his Kissimmee land operation. Consecutive freezes in 1894 and 1895 wiped out the [[citrus]] industry. The freezes, combined with [[South Florida]]'s growth and the relocation of steamship operations to [[Lake Okeechobee]], left Kissimmee dependent on [[open range]] [[cattle ranching]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Octogenarian Still Loves Quarter Horses And A Good Rodeo|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-12-12/news/9312110860_1_horses-roberts-was-born-campbell-station|date=December 12, 1993|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Cowman\">{{cite news|title=A Cattleman for All Seasons Development Can't Fence In Tommy Reaves' Love For The Land|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-07-04/features/9006280673_1_reaves-herd-cattle|date=July 4, 1990|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nKissimmee had a population of 4,310 in 1950.
