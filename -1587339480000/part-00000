Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\".

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\".

The rivalry is best known for its [[college football]] matchup, and originated in a series of football games played from 2005 to 2008. In 2013, when UCF joined the [[American Athletic Conference]], the schools began competing annually in all sports, with the yearly football game played on [[American football on Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving weekend]]. In 2016, the schools officially adopted the \"War on I-4\" as an official competition series. Each year, the team with the most wins across all sports receives an I\u20134 road sign trophy; the winner of the football game also receives a similar trophy.\n\n==Names==\nStarting when the schools first met on the gridiron in 2005, some writers dubbed the rivalry the \"War on I\u20134\". When the series resumed in 2013, administrators from both schools named it the \"I\u20134 Corridor Clash\". Both names refer to [[Interstate 4]], an [[interstate highway]] that runs through both [[Orlando]] and [[Tampa]] in [[Central Florida]].<ref name=Brown>{{cite news|title=It's First Nickname Saturday |first1=Rick |last1=Brown |url=http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050917/COLUMNISTS0614/509170387/1254 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102155436/http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050917%2FCOLUMNISTS0614%2F509170387%2F1254 |archive-date=November 2, 2013 |newspaper=[[The Ledger]] |date=September 17, 2005 |accessdate=August 13, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wftv.com/news/brus-clues-week-14-college-football-picks/165933797 |title=Bru's Clues: Week 14 College Football Picks |last1=Bruey |first1=Christian |date=November 27, 2013 |website= www.wftv.com |publisher= WFTV |accessdate=November 30, 2013}}</ref> In 2016, when the schools announced the official competition, they formally adopted the \"War on I-4\" name.<ref name=\"USF Establish\" /><ref name=\"UCF Establish\" />\n\nThe name \"[[War on I-4 (arena football)|War on I-4]]\" had been used for an [[arena football]] rivalry between the [[Tampa Bay Storm]] and [[Orlando Predators]] between 1992 and 2016; those two teams were likewise located in the same metropolitan areas.

and [[University of South Florida]] [[South Florida Bulls|Bulls]]. The rivalry is best known for its [[college football]] matchup, and originated in a series of football games played from 2005 to 2008. In 2013, when UCF joined the [[American Athletic Conference]], the schools began competing annually in all sports, with the yearly football game played on [[American football on Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving weekend]]. In 2016, the schools officially adopted the \"War on I-4\" as an official competition series. Each year, the team with the most wins across all sports receives an I\u20134 road sign trophy; the winner of the football game also receives a similar trophy.\n\n==Names==\nStarting when the schools first met on the gridiron in 2005, some writers dubbed the rivalry the \"War on I\u20134\". When the series resumed in 2013, administrators from both schools named it the \"I\u20134 Corridor Clash\". Both names refer to [[Interstate 4]], an [[interstate highway]] that runs through both [[Orlando]] and [[Tampa]] in [[Central Florida]].<ref name=Brown>{{cite news|title=It's First Nickname Saturday |first1=Rick |last1=Brown |url=http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050917/COLUMNISTS0614/509170387/1254 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102155436/http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050917%2FCOLUMNISTS0614%2F509170387%2F1254 |archive-date=November 2, 2013 |newspaper=[[The Ledger]] |date=September 17, 2005 |accessdate=August 13, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wftv.com/news/brus-clues-week-14-college-football-picks/165933797 |title=Bru's Clues: Week 14 College Football Picks |last1=Bruey |first1=Christian |date=November 27, 2013 |website= www.wftv.com |publisher= WFTV |accessdate=November 30, 2013}}</ref> In 2016, when the schools announced the official competition, they formally adopted the \"War on I-4\" name.<ref name=\"USF Establish\" /><ref name=\"UCF Establish\" />\n\nThe name \"[[War on I-4 (arena football)|War on I-4]]\" had been used for an [[arena football]] rivalry between the [[Tampa Bay Storm]] and [[Orlando Predators]] between 1992 and 2016; those two teams were likewise located in the same metropolitan areas.

Yet, due to the variety of shapes and regional variants, \"one man's ''gnocchetto'' can be another's ''strascinato''\".{{sfn|Zanini De Vita|2009|page=xviii}}\n\nSome pasta varieties are uniquely regional and not widely known; many types have different names based on region or language. For example, the cut [[rotelle]] is also called ''ruote'' in Italy and ''wagon wheels'' in the United States. Manufacturers and cooks often invent new shapes of pasta, or may rename preexisting shapes for marketing reasons.\n\n[[Italian language|Italian]] pasta names often end with the [[Gender (linguistics)|masculine]] [[Number (linguistics)|plural]] [[suffix]]es ''-ini'', ''-elli'', ''-illi'', ''-etti'' or the feminine plurals ''-ine'', ''-elle'' etc., all conveying the sense of \"little\"; or with ''-oni'', ''-one'', meaning \"large\". Other suffixes like ''-otti'' (\"largish\") and ''-acci'' (\"rough\", \"badly made\") may also occur. In Italian, all pasta type names are plural.\n\nEach pasta has its own unique purpose. For example, penne and fusilli can hold more sauces than spaghetti due to their hollow shapes. Additionally, the choice of pasta can be used to complement the consistency of sauces used in the cooking process. These choices, however, are mostly due to tradition and habits.{{sfn|Zanini De Vita|2009|page=xiv}}\n\n== Long- and medium-length pasta ==\nLong pasta may be made by [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] or rolling and cutting.{{Clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px; class=\" |Image\n!Type\n! style=\"width: 12em;\" |Description\n!Translation\n!Synonyms\n!Origin or main area of consumption\n|-\n|\n|[[Barbine]]\n|Thin strands, often coiled into nests\n|Little beards<ref name=\"Cosmo 2017\">{{cite book | last=Cosmo | first=S. | title=The Ultimate Pasta and Noodle Cookbook | publisher=Cider Mill Press | year=2017 | isbn=978-1-60433-733-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AcOZDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA85 | access-date=30 December 2019 | page=85}}</ref>\n|Barbina\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Bavette side.png|120x120px]]\n|[[Bavette (pasta)|Bavette]]\n|Narrower version of tagliatelle\n|Bibs<ref name=\"Kostioukovitch22\" />\n|Baverine, bavettine, lasagneddi (in Sicily){{sfn|Zanini De Vita|2009|pages=117-118}}\n|[[Liguria]]{{sfn|Zanini De Vita|2009|pages=117-118}}\n|-\n|[[File:Bigoli2.jpg|120x120px]]\n|[[Bigoli]]\n|Thick, softer, spaghetti-like pasta.

Yet, due to the variety of shapes and regional variants, \"one man's ''gnocchetto'' can be another's ''strascinato''\".{{sfn|Zanini De Vita|2009|page=xviii}}\n\nSome pasta varieties are uniquely regional and not widely known; many types have different names based on region or language. For example, the cut [[rotelle]] is also called ''ruote'' in Italy and ''wagon wheels'' in the United States. Manufacturers and cooks often invent new shapes of pasta, or may rename preexisting shapes for marketing reasons.\n\n[[Italian language|Italian]] pasta names often end with the [[Gender (linguistics)|masculine]] [[Number (linguistics)|plural]] [[suffix]]es ''-ini'', ''-elli'', ''-illi'', ''-etti'' or the feminine plurals ''-ine'', ''-elle'' etc., all conveying the sense of \"little\"; or with ''-oni'', ''-one'', meaning \"large\". Other suffixes like ''-otti'' (\"largish\") and ''-acci'' (\"rough\", \"badly made\") may also occur. In Italian, all pasta type names are plural.\n\nEach pasta has its own unique purpose. For example, penne and fusilli can hold more sauces than spaghetti due to their hollow shapes. Additionally, the choice of pasta can be used to complement the consistency of sauces used in the cooking process. These choices, however, are mostly due to tradition and habits.{{sfn|Zanini De Vita|2009|page=xiv}}\n\n== Long- and medium-length pasta ==\nLong pasta may be made by [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] or rolling and cutting.{{Clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px; class=\" |Image\n!Type\n! style=\"width: 12em;\" |Description\n!Translation\n!Synonyms\n!Origin or main area of consumption\n|-\n|\n|[[Barbine]]\n|Thin strands, often coiled into nests\n|Little beards<ref name=\"Cosmo 2017\">{{cite book | last=Cosmo | first=S. | title=The Ultimate Pasta and Noodle Cookbook | publisher=Cider Mill Press | year=2017 | isbn=978-1-60433-733-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AcOZDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA85 | access-date=30 December 2019 | page=85}}</ref>\n|Barbina\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Bavette side.png|120x120px]]\n|[[Bavette (pasta)|Bavette]]\n|Narrower version of tagliatelle\n|Bibs<ref name=\"Kostioukovitch22\" />\n|Baverine, bavettine, lasagneddi (in Sicily){{sfn|Zanini De Vita|2009|pages=117-118}}\n|[[Liguria]]{{sfn|Zanini De Vita|2009|pages=117-118}}\n|-\n|[[File:Bigoli2.jpg|120x120px]]\n|[[Bigoli]]\n|Thick, softer, spaghetti-like pasta.

They are single-celled organisms with no true nuclear membrane (prokaryotic organisms). \n\nThe taxon Monera was first proposed as a phylum by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1866. Subsequently, the phylum was elevated to the rank of kingdom in 1925 by [[\u00c9douard Chatton]]. The last commonly accepted mega-classification with the taxon Monera was the [[Kingdom (biology)#Five kingdoms|five-kingdom]] classification system established by [[Robert Whittaker (ecologist)|Robert Whittaker]] in 1969.\n\nUnder the [[three-domain system]] of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], introduced by [[Carl Woese]] in 1977, which reflects the evolutionary history of life, the organisms found in kingdom Monera have been divided into two [[domain (biology)|domains]], [[Archaea]] and [[Bacteria]] (with [[Eukarya]] as the third domain). Furthermore, the taxon Monera is [[paraphyletic]] (does not include all descendants of their most-recent common ancestor), as [[Archaea]] and [[Eukarya]] are currently believed to be more closely related than either is to [[Bacteria]].

Haeckel's Monera included not only bacterial groups of early discovery but also several small eukaryotic organisms; in fact the genus [[Vibrio]] is the only bacterial genus explicitly assigned to the phylum, while others are mentioned indirectly, which led [[Herbert Copeland|Copeland]] to speculate that Haeckel considered all bacteria to belong to the genus Vibrio, ignoring other bacterial genera.<ref name=\"Copeland1938\"/> One notable exception were the members of the modern phylum [[Cyanobacteria]], such as ''[[Nostoc]]'', which were placed in the phylum Archephyta of [[Algae]] (vide infra: [[Monera#Blue-green algae|Blue-green algae]]).\n\nThe Neolatin noun Monera and the German noun Moneren/Moneres<!--German common nouns have capital letter--> are derived from the ancient Greek noun ''moneres'', which Haeckel stated meant \"simple\";<ref name=Haeckel67/> however, it actually means \"single, solitary\".<ref>{{LSJ|monh/rhs|\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ae\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2|ref}}.</ref> Haeckel also describes the protist genus [[Monas (genus)|Monas]] in the two pages about Monera in his 1866 book.<ref name=Haeckel67/><!--It is not the type species or similar, though!--> The informal name of a member of the Monera was initially moneron,<ref name=Pascoe>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/zoologicalclassi00pasc|author=Francis Polkinghorne Pascoe|year=1880|title=Zoological classification; a handy book of reference with tables of the subkingdoms, classes, orders, etc., of the animal kingdom, their characters and lists of the families and principal genera|publisher=London, J.

J Bacteriol 42: 437- 466) recognized the Kingdom Monera with two phyla, Myxophyta and Schizomycetae, the latter comprising classes Eubacteriae (3 orders), Myxobacteriae (1 order), and Spirochetae (1 order); Bisset (1962, Bacteria, 2nd ed., Livingston, London) distinguished 1 class and 4 orders: Eubacteriales, Actinomycetales, Streptomycetales, and Flexibacteriales; Orla-Jensen (1909, Die Hauptlinien des naturalischen Bakteriensystems nebst einer Ubersicht der Garungsphenomene. Zentr. Bakt. Parasitenk., II, 22: 305-346) and Bergey et al (1925, Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, Baltimore : Williams & Wilkins Co.) with many subsequent editions) also presented classifications.\n\n===Rise to prominence===\nThe term Monera became well established in the 20s and 30s when to rightfully increase the importance of the difference between species with a nucleus and without.

Although distinguishing between prokaryotes from eukaryotes as a fundamental distinction is often credited to a 1937 paper by [[\u00c9douard Chatton]] (little noted until 1962), he did not emphasize this distinction more than other biologists of his era.<ref name=\"sapp\"/> [[Roger Stanier]] and [[C.

{"title_page": "Peter Greig-Smith", "text_new": "'''Peter Greig-Smith''' (b. 1922\u2013d. 2003) was a British plant ecologist, founder of the discipline of quantitative ecology in the United Kingdom. He had a deep influence across the world on vegetation studies and plant ecology, mostly from his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', first published in 1957 and a must-read for multiple generations of young ecologists.[[File:Peter Greig-Smith -1988.tif|thumb|Jubilee Symposium for the 75th anniversary of the British Ecological Society at University College, London held on April 12-13 1988. Past Presidents gathered for a team photograph: Back row, left to right: A.D. Bradshaw, R.J. Berry, '''Peter Greig-Smith''', A. Macfadyen, C.H. Gimingham, G. Dunnet, L.R.Taylor. Front row from left: C.H. Evans; P.R. Richards, J. Harley, R. Southwood.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith was hired by the University College of North Wales at Bangor, Wales (now Bangor University), where he spent the rest of his academic career. His book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' spread the ideas of rigorous, quantitative ecological methods among the world\u2019s research community, and made his lab at Bangor a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in mathematical and statistical methods. A stout supporter of Bangor\u2019s graduate program in Ecology, he recruited and advised many students and research collaborators from all continents.\n\nA prominent member of the British Ecological Society, he was first elected to Council in 1957, and in 1961 he became Honorary Secretary. He held this post until 1964, when he resigned to become editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'', the society\u2019s scientific publication. He remained as editor until 1968. In 1977 he was elected Vice President of the Society, and served as President in 1978 and 1979.\n\n== Mathematics in Ecology ==\nThe postwar period, and especially the 1950s, saw a rising quest for a truly quantitative approach to community ecology. Community description to that point had been predominantly qualitative and had been based mostly on attempts to extend the principles of Linnaean taxonomy into the classification of plant communities. Four innovative ecologists directed their efforts to bring the principles of statistics and mathematics to vegetation analysis: [[John Thomas Curtis|John T. Curtis]] and [[Robert Whittaker (ecologist)|Robert H. Whittaker]] in the United States, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David W. Goodall]] and Peter Greig-Smith in the United Kingdom. J. T. Curtis, in collaboration with [[J. Roger Bray]], developed the first method of community ordination and also developed the idea of ecological dissimilarity or \u201cecological distance measure\u201d that later opened the way to the concept of niche overlap. Robert H. Whittaker was the proponent of gradient analysis to address fundamental questions of how plants use space and resources. He provided foundational elements for a quantitative theory of biodiversity and was most active in the areas of plant community analysis, succession, and productivity. David Goodall worked as a professor of agricultural botany at the University of Reading, where he developed a series of studies on plant sampling, distribution, and multivariate analysis. In 1956, however, Goodall immigrated to Australia, where he led a sixty-year-long and extremely fruitful career, becoming one of the world\u2019s most renowned ecologists. Greig-Smith, eight years younger than Goodall, became the champion of the quantitative approach in plant ecology in Britain.\n\n== Early Work ==\n[[File:AS Watt.tif|thumb|Alexander S. Watt, Greig-Smith's mentor and one of the most influential British ecologists of the 20th Century.]]\nGreig-Smith went to school in Birmingham, United Kingdom, before going to Downing College, Cambridge, where he was inspired by the teachings of [[Alexander Watt|Alexander S. Watt]], the first British botanist to seriously study the phenomenon of pattern and scaling in plant communities from a quantitative perspective. Watt\u2019s influence can be seen in Greig-Smith\u2019s obituaries of him<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. A. S. Watt, F.R.S.: A biographical note.

''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' 35):404\u2013423.</ref>. The ''Biographical Memoirs'' of the Royal Society show that Watt, in turn, had studied at Cambridge under the mentorship of the ecologist Sir [[Arthur Tansley|Arthur G. Tansley]] (1871\u20131955), a direct academic descendant of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]] (Tansley had studied with Francis W. Oliver [1864\u20131951] at the University College, London, who in turn had been mentored by Sir E. Ray Lankester [1847\u20131929] at Cambridge, a student of George Rolleston [1829\u20131881] at Oxford, who had been in turn mentored by Thomas Henry Huxley \u2014\"Darwin's bulldog\"\u2014 in London). In 1944, after graduating from Cambridge, Greig-Smith went to the Imperial College\u2019s Field Station at Slough, where he studied the effect of herbicides on oilseed crops under the direction of the Geoffrey E. Blackman, founder of the science of selective herbicides in Britain. The Slough herbicide tests, part of Britain\u2019s war effort, involved the planting of large-scale experiments with random block and nested designs, an experience that played a central role in nurturing Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in statistical methods and experimental plot designs. In 1945 he moved to the University of Manchester as lecturer in botany. At Manchester, he cultivated a wide array of research interests, ranging from the taxonomy of liverworts and stinging nettles, the causes of spatial pattern in dune plants, the quantitative morphology and tussock formation of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (a dune grass), and the biogeographic distribution of liverworts to understand the fate of vegetation in the British Isles during the last glaciation.\n\n===Dune Ecology===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s first published paper dealt with the varying growth forms of the dune grass ''Ammophila arenaria'' in calcareous sand dunes on the Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Alan R. Gemmell, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1947. Tussock formation in ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L) Link. ''New Phytologist'' 46(2): 262\u2013268.</ref>. This paper was followed two years later by a detailed description of the dune\u2019s plants<ref>Gimingham, Charles H., Alan R. Gemmell, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1949. The vegetation of a sand-dune system in the Outer Hebrides. ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 35(1): 82\u201396.</ref>, using quantitative methods to describe the plant community. These early papers already mark his interest for quantification of natural phenomena. In this morphometric analysis of ''Ammophila arenaria'', for example, Greig-Smith measured in detail the internode length of the plant\u2019s rhizomes and noted the species\u2019 tendency to form tussock-like clumps in older dunes and longer, exploratory rhizomes in unstable, younger dunes.\n\n===Taxonomy and Biogeography===\nSome of Greig-Smith\u2019s early work was devoted to taxonomy and biogeography, trying to bring a quantitative approach to these branches of the biological sciences. Much of his taxonomic work was devoted to the evolutionary taxonomy and ecology of pounceworts (Lejeunaceae, a family of liverworts)<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948b. ''Potamolejeunea Holtii'' (spruce) nov.comb. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 1(2): 108\u2013109.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948c.

In 1950 he published a synthesis paper on the taxonomy and biogeography of liverworts<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1954. Notes on Lejeuneaceae: II. A quantitative assessment of criteria used in distinguishing some British species of ''Lejeunea''. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 2(3): 458\u2013469.</ref>, as an early attempt to shed some light on the question of the effects of Quaternary glaciations on the history of the British flora<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1950. Evidence from hepatics on the history of the British flora. ''Journal of Ecology'' 38(2): 320\u2013344.</ref>. He tried to evaluate how many of the extant British liverworts had survived Pleistocene glaciations ''in situ'' and how many, in contrast, were postglacial migrants from southern latitudes. Almost two decades before the theory of Pleistocene refugia was proposed by [[J\u00fcrgen Haffer]] for the Amazon<ref>Haffer, J\u00fcrgen. 1969. Speciation in Amazonian forest birds. ''Science'' 165(3889): 131\u2013137.</ref>, Greig-Smith was using plant distributions to understand the vegetation changes induced by Pleistocene glaciations, and setting a new direction for Quaternary Paleobotany that few could value in its full significance at that time. As part of the Flora of the British Isles series published in the ''Journal of Ecology'', Greig-Smith drafted a synthesis paper of the natural history of the nettles of the United Kingdom, and a detailed analysis of the communities where they prosper<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948a. Biological flora of the British Isles: ''Urtica'' L. ''Journal of Ecology'' 36(2): 339\u2013355.</ref>.\n\n===Tropical Ecology===\nIn 1940, Paul Richards, Sir Arthur Tansley, and Alexander Watt published a seminal paper<ref>Richards, Paul W., Arthur G. Tansley and Alexander S. Watt. 1940. The recording of structure, life form and flora of tropical forest communities as a basis for their classification. ''Journal of Ecology'' 28(1): 224\u2013239.</ref> on the classification of tropical rainforests revealing a fascination with the complexity of tropical vegetation that was halted by the war, but that Watt passed down later to Greig-Smith, his student at Cambridge. In July 1948 Greig-Smith received a research grant from the Colonial Office to visit the island of Trinidad to study tropical rainforests. Encouraged by E. Ashby, an early pioneer of quantitative methods who was then professor of botany at Manchester, he left the university for six months to study secondary succession in Trinidad, in collaboration with colleagues of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture on the island.\n\nLike Darwin in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, he was gripped by the complexity of tropical forests. In order to try to unravel and explain this complexity, he developed novel statistical methods to test hypotheses on the association between species and the spatial pattern of saplings and adult trees in the field. An avid naturalist, he also developed in Trinidad a passion for orchids, which led him later to start cultivating his own orchid collection in the United Kingdom. After his visit to Trinidad in 1948, Greig-Smith drafted two detailed papers on secondary tropical forests<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952a. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 1. General features of the vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 283\u2013330.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952b. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 2. Structure of the communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 316\u2013330.</ref>. The first study included a number of techniques that at that time were novel in vegetation analysis, such as the species-area plots developed by Ronald A. Fisher and Henry Gleason, size-specific survivorship, and quantitative floristic tables. In the second Trinidad paper, he also used nested analyses of variance (ANOVAs), comparisons with the Poisson distribution, and variance-to-mean ratios to test and understand spatial patterns in the trees of the secondary forest. He concluded his paper questioning Frederic Clement\u2019s concept of plant communities as complex supra-organisms, and in support of Gleason\u2019s individualistic model of plant communities.\n\n== Bangor ==\n[[File:Bangor greenhouses.jpg|thumb|Greenhouses of the School of Plant Biology at Bangor in the mid-1970s. Photo courtesy of Bangor University.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith moved to the [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales at Bangor]], where he spent the rest of his career. After the publication of his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' in 1957, which rapidly spread among the research community and became a success, Bangor became a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in quantitative methods. Greig-Smith was keenly interested in the MSc program in Ecology that Professor Paul W. Richards had developed at Bangor, and advised many Masters' students from where he recruited many doctoral students and research collaborators. Most of the students, postdocs, and research visitors in his lab later became outstanding ecologists in their own right, such as Georg Grabherr (University of Vienna), Kenneth A. Kershaw (who moved to McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario), Michael P. Austin (a postdoc at Bangor, studying tropical forests, who later moved to CSIRO at Canberra, Australia), Robert P. McIntosh (University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci (also a postdoc, later moved to the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada), Timothy F. H. Allen (University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison), Mark O. Hill (Natural Environment Research Council, Swindon, UK), Michael J. Liddle (Monks Wood Experimental Station, Cambridgeshire, UK; later at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia), Michael D. Swaine (University of Aberdeen, Scotland), M. A. Pemadasa (University of Sri Lanka), David J. Gibson (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale), and Tewolde B. G. Egziabher (Environmental Protection Authority, Ethiopia), among many others. The place was a haven for academic exchange: Laszlo Orl\u00f3ci recalls in his biographical memories<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 2019. ''Looking back: A life of statistical ecology''. 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. Scada Publishing, Canada.

Also available at: <nowiki>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334432585</nowiki>)</ref> that during 1964 alone, Greig-Smith\u2019s lab at Bangor received the visit of [[Robert R. Sokal|Robert Sokal]] and [[Peter Sneath]], founders of the discipline of numerical taxonomy, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David Goodall]], William T. Williams, and Mike Dale, who were creating initial content for a solid school of statistical ecology in Australia.\n\n=== Pattern and Scaling in Ecological Sciences ===\n[[File:Scaling design.tif|thumb|In the early 1950s, Greig-Smith started using graphs in which he plotted the variance in plant density versus the size of the sample plot, to find peaks that could identify clump size in aggregated distributions. In doing so, he realized that ecosystem properties are scale-dependent: a species can have a regular distribution at a given scale, but be highly clumped at another.]]\nGreig-Smith was fascinated by the phenomenon of plant spatial pattern, defined by the question: why are some plants regularly spaced while others are densely clumped? He realized that plants could be clumped at a certain scale, but that those clumps, in turn, could be randomly, or even regularly distributed at larger scales. Patterns and processes in ecology, he concluded, can have different behaviors at different scale. Strongly influenced by his early experience in agricultural experiments using random blocks and nested designs, he sought to answer this question by using, as his core tool, a series of quadrats nested within each other at different scales. Much of Greig-Smith\u2019s published work was devoted to advancing the theory and methods of plant pattern, using his nested-quadrat approach as a basic tool. His fundamental idea that the perceived properties of ecological phenomena are scale-dependent set the foundations for the development of a theory of scaling in ecology, a central concept in modern climate change and global sustainability studies.\n\n==== Dunes as Model Ecosystems ====\nOne of Greig-Smith\u2019s early research papers, Gemmell, et al.

''Transactions of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 36(2): 132\u2013136.</ref>, dealt with the formation of tussocks in ''Ammophila arenaria'' and included detailed observations on the clumped distribution of tillers, which form tussock-like clumps in older, fixed dunes but are regularly distributed in the younger, moving dunes. After this initial study, the spatial pattern of dunes and grasslands became a lifelong interest in his ecological research, published in a number of papers with collaborators and students<ref>Gemmell, Alan R., Peter Greig-Smith, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1953. A note on the behaviour of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L.) Link, in relation to sand-dune formation.

One of Greig-Smith\u2019s students, Andrew Morton, continued Greig-Smith\u2019s pattern analysis studies in the dunes at Newborough Warren in Anglesey, Wales, near Bangor.\n\n====Pattern in Tropical Ecosystems====\nBelow only the study of coastal dunes, Greig-Smith\u2019s interests were strongly focused on tropical ecosystems. After his visit to Trinidad as a young researcher, he developed an interest for African savannas, on the possibility of using his methodology for pattern analysis to understand the importance of intraspecific competition in tropical, strongly rainfall-seasonal ecosystems<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, and Michael J. Chadwick. 1965. Data on pattern within plant communities: III. ''Acacia-Capparis'' semi-desert scrub in the Sudan. ''Journal of Ecology'' 53(2): 465\u2013474.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1991.

The use of random and contiguous quadrats in the study of the structure of plant communities. ''Annals of Botany'' 16(2): 293\u2013316.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1961.

The analysis of pattern in vegetation: A comment on a paper by D. W. Goodall. ''Journal of Ecology'' 51(1): 223\u2013229.</ref>, he showed the importance of scaling in the measurement of plant spatial pattern. He understood that researchers sampling the same vegetation with quadrats of different size could reach diametrically opposed conclusions: a researcher using small quadrats would find that his quadrats harbor either clumps or no plants at all, and would conclude that the species pattern in space follows a clumped distribution. Similarly, a researcher using large quadrats would find a similar number of clumps in each quadrat and would conclude that the species distribution is markedly regular. In reality, both would be right because a species can have a strongly clumped distribution at a certain scale and a regular distribution at another. As president of the British Ecological Society, he wrote an address in 1979<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1979. Pattern in vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 67(3): 755\u2013779.</ref>, in which he summarized his ideas on the importance of scaling in ecological spatial pattern. Some of his students took his ideas and pursued them further: Mark Hill developed a rigorous mathematical theory for the analysis of pattern at a community level<ref>Hill, M. O. 1973. The intensity of spatial pattern in plant communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(1): 225\u2013235.</ref>, while Kenneth Kershaw, after publishing in co-authorship with Greig-Smith, continued exploring for years the drivers of pattern at different scales.\n\n====Scaling in Modern Ecology====\nThe fundamental concept that ecological phenomena could have different behaviors when measured at different scales became really important for understanding large-scale phenomena in the biosphere. The Theory of Scaling became a mainstream concept in ecological research in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the publication of two now-classic papers: Wiens 1989<ref>Wiens, John A. 1989. Spatial scaling in ecology. ''Functional Ecology'' 3(4): 385\u2013397.</ref> and [[Simon A. Levin|Simon Levin]] 1992<ref>Levin, Simon A. 1992. The problem of pattern and scale in ecology: The Robert H. McArthur Award Lecture. ''Ecology'' 73(6): 1943\u20131967.</ref>. Greig-Smith, however, had figured out the main concepts four decades before, and both Wiens and Levin recognized him as a scientific pioneer.\n\n=== Multivariate Methods: Classification and Ordination in Ecology ===\nGreig-Smith was among the first ecologists to understand that multivariate methods were destined to become important tools in quantitative plant ecology. His inclusion of multivariate [[Cluster analysis|classification]] and [[Principal component analysis|ordination]] in his book opened the door for the explosion of analytical approaches and methodological discussions that surged in the 1970s and 1980s. As with pattern analysis, Greig-Smith was ahead of his time: although the potential of multivariate methods\u2014based on matrix algebra\u2014was already recognized in the 1950s, mostly as a result of a growing need for more-rigorous methods in ecology, performing an analysis of a modestly sized floristic matrix of, say, fifty sites and one hundred species was a complicated and enormously time-consuming task. The generalized access to electronic computers, which began in the 1960s, opened the doors for the widespread use of these methods; Bangor\u2019s first computer became available in 1964. Greig-Smith saw in multivariate methods an opportunity to analyze and understand the complex floristic composition of tropical forests, which had fascinated him since his visit to Trinidad in 1948. In 1963 he applied for a grant to investigate the use of quantitative methods to establish whether the highly diverse tropical rainforests showed any organized pattern, particularly in relation to environment, an open question at the time. With these funds, in 1964 he appointed Michael Austin as a postdoctoral research assistant to the project. Three seminal papers were published as a result of their collaboration, highlighting the potential of multivariate methods to analyze floristic patterns in complex, multispecies communities<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Michael P. Austin, and Timothy C. Whitmore. 1967. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: I. Association-analysis and principal component ordination of rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 55(2): 483\u2013503.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1968. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: II. Some methodological problems of data from rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 56(3): 827\u2013844.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., Peter S. Ashton, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1972. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: III. A re-examination of rain forest data from Brunei. ''Journal of Ecology'' 60(2): 305\u2013324.</ref>. The power of his approach, merging multivariate descriptive methods with experimental hypothesis testing, is especially noticeable in the work of some of his students like Mike Austin (cited previously), Exequiel Ezcurra<ref>Ezcurra, E. 1987. A comparison of Reciprocal Averaging and Non-Centred Principal Component Analysis. ''Vegetatio'' 71(1): 41\u201348.</ref>, and F.B. Goldsmith<ref>Goldsmith, F. B. 1973a.

The vegetation of exposed sea cliffs at South Stack, Anglesey: II. Experimental studies. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(3): 819\u2013829.</ref>, among others. Mike Austin later moved to Australia and became one of the country\u2019s leading ecologists.\n\n==== Multivariate Methods as Hypothesis-Generating Procedures ====\nHaving laid the foundations of the discipline of multivariate methods, as a committed naturalist and field biologist Greig-Smith never took much interest in abstruse theoretical discussions, always expressing his concern about the risk of becoming too engaged with theoretical refinements of methodology and repeatedly stating his belief that numerical methods are worth developing only if they are to be used on real data in attempts to answer real questions with relevance in the field. The ultimate evidence, for him, was not in the computer output but in the field. In a synthesis paper published in 1980, he insisted that multivariate methods are simply hypothesis-generating procedures, and counseled students to do experimental tests addressing the insights from the classification and ordination analyses rather than taking the results of their analyses as an unchallengeable truth<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1980. The development of numerical classification and ordination. ''Vegetatio'' 42(1\u20133): 1\u20139.</ref>.\n\n==== Novel Approaches to Multivariate Analysis ====\nGreig-Smith\u2019s later papers on multivariate methods, with Mike Swaine<ref>Swaine, Michael D., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1980. An application of principal components analysis to vegetation change in permanent plots. ''Journal of Ecology'' 68(1): 33\u201341.</ref> and Carlos Monta\u00f1a<ref>Monta\u00f1a, Carlos, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1990. Correspondence analysis of species by environmental variable matrices. ''Journal of Vegetation Science'' 1(4): 453\u2013460.</ref>, were devoted to exploring new and innovative applications for multivariate analysis, including the analysis of time-series data and the exploration of the niche preference of species within a community. In the first two decades of the 21st Century, with the advent of powerful computers and large datasets from molecular genetics studies, the methods of numerical classification and eigenvector ordination, promoted by Greig-Smith half a century earlier, exploded in their use to become indispensable tools in the new molecular approaches to taxonomy, genomics, phylogeography, and anthropolgy.\n\n===''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' (book) ===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s most influential work was his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', used by generations of students and young researchers around the world. The book, first published in 1957, enjoyed two subsequent editions in 1964 and 1982<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1957. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1964. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 2d ed. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 3d ed. Studies in Ecology 9. Berkeley: Univ. of California Press.</ref>.\n\nThe success of Greig-Smith\u2019s book triggered the publication of many other similar books, many of them by former Greig-Smith collaborators (such as Kershaw 1964<ref>Kershaw, Kenneth A. 1964. ''Quantitative and dynamic ecology''. New York: American Elsevier.</ref> and Orl\u00f3ci 1975<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 1975. ''Multivariate analysis in vegetation research''. The Hague: W. Junk.</ref>), and nurtured an explosion of concepts and ideas around the quantitative treatment of ecological data, many of which arose in Canada (such as [[E. C. Pielou|Pielou]] 1969<ref>Pielou, Evelyn C. 1969. ''Introduction to Mathematical Ecology''. New York: Wiley-Interscience.</ref>) and Australia (such as Williams 1976<ref>Williams, William T., ed. 1976. ''Pattern analysis in agricultural science''. New York: Elsevier Scientific.</ref>).\n\n=== Holism and Reductionism in Ecology ===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, at the time when the School of Plant Biology at Bangor consolidated as a global magnet for plant ecologists, an active scientific debate, excellently synthesized in Barbour (1996)<ref name=\":0\">Barbour, Michael G. 1996. American ecology and American culture in the 1950s: Who led whom? ''Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America'' 77(1): 44\u201351.</ref>, was taking place worldwide on the role of holism and reductionism as the main tools to understand ecological phenomena. In Britain, this debate centered mostly on the use of descriptive methods or the quest to understand patterns in nature, as opposed to the use of experimental methods or the search for ecological processes. In Bangor, in particular, the most vocal proponent of an experimental and reductionist approach to ecological research was [[John L. Harper]], who often criticized quantitative vegetation scientists on their descriptive, rather than experimental, approach to research. Roy Turkington<ref>Turkington, Roy. 2009. Obituary: Professor John L. Harper FRS CBE (1925\u20132009). ''Journal of Ecology'' 97(5): 835\u2013837.</ref> recalls that Harper strongly favored the power of simple, direct experiments and distrusted complex multivariate methods, often arguing that ordination methods were \u201ca formalized description of consequences.\u201d \u201cNowhere is this holism more apparent than in the way ecology is taught in many schools and universities with its emphasis on complex systems and the ways in which they can be described,\u201d wrote Harper in \u201cAfter Description\u201d<ref>Harper, John L. 1982. After description. In ''The plant community as a working mechanism: Produced as a tribute to A. S. Watt''. Edited by E. I. Newman, 11\u201325. Special Publication of the British Ecological Society 1. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications.</ref>, and he immediately added: \u201cThere is probably no other science in which students are taught by being dropped into the deep end of complexity.\u201d The contrast between experimental ecology in simplified systems, with only one or a few species, against large-scale pattern-seeking methods led Peter Greig-Smith and John Harper into frequent discussions in the form of good-humored debates following departmental seminars in Bangor, which, as amusingly evoked in Hill (2003)<ref>Hill, Mark O. 2003. Peter Greig-Smith (1922\u20132003). ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 34(4): 10\u201311.</ref> and Matlack (2009)<ref>Matlack, Glenn R., ed. 2009. ''Memories of John L. Harper: A remembrance by his friends, students, and colleagues''. 2d ed. Bangor, Wales: SPB. Available online at <nowiki>http://people.virginia.edu/~ja8n/Publications/2011</nowiki> Memories of John L Harper.pdf</ref>, were conducted amid legendary clouds of pipe smoke for the benefit of the students, who could see firsthand how academic arguments conducted both with rigor and humor can be very stimulating and deeply entertaining. \n\nGreig-Smith, however, was not really a holist. From his very first papers on the tropical forests of Trinidad, he embraced Henry Gleason\u2019s \u201cindividualistic\u201d model of plant communities. [[Timothy F. H. Allen|Tim Allen]], a Greig-Smith student in the 1960s, recalls that while in the 1980s \u201cthe use of descriptive multivariate methods degenerated into a ritual that community ecologists were expected to perform\u201d<ref>Allen, Timothy F. H., Amanda J. Zellmer, and C. J. Wuennenberg. 2005. The loss of narrative. In ''Ecological paradigms lost: Routes of theory change''. Edited by Kim Cuddington and Beatrix Beisner, 333\u2013370. Theoretical Ecology 2. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic.</ref>, Greig-Smith insisted that ecological research should always have experimental tests addressing the insights gained and the hypotheses derived from the quantitative analysis, as in Morton (1974)<ref>Morton, Andrew J. 1974. Ecological studies of a fixed dune grassland at Newborough Warren, Anglesey: II. Causal factors of the grassland structure. ''Journal of Ecology'' 62(1): 261\u2013278.</ref>. Perhaps the main difference with Harper\u2019s single-species experimental approach lied in Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in complex, multispecies systems, and his opinion that projects should start with observations and the search for patterns, before establishing hypotheses about the processes that drive ecosystem functions and experimenting to tests these hypotheses. The debates between Harper and Greig-Smith at Bangor had a large influence on the development of ecological theory in the last four decades of the 20th Century.\n\n=== Greig-Smith's Intellectual Progeny ===\nIn Bangor, Greig-Smith took the view that it was up to his students and young postdocs to define the project, develop the scientific hypotheses, and do the work, provided that they included quantitative ecology, his own area of expertise, in their graduate research. He rarely put his own name on his students\u2019 research papers, so that his enormous influence is visible often only in the acknowledgements of published papers. However, some of the papers written by students and researchers while at Greig-Smith\u2019s lab rank among the highest cited in ecology, and owe much of their originality to Greig-Smith\u2019s mentorship<ref>Austin, Michael P., and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci. 1966.

Scientifically, he was a disciplinarian and somewhat of a traditionalist but was also a strong proponent of the separation between scientific positions and political or social points of view. In a letter to Michael Barbour, he wrote: \u201c''There may be parallels between ecology and politics but if so I suspect they are coincidental. I see no parallels between my political or social attitudes and my ecological views''.\"<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Dove, Michael R., and Daniel M. Kammen. 2015.

(ISBN: 978-0-415-71598-0)</ref> Possibly as a result of his work at Trinidad as a young researcher in 1953, he always had a receptive and supportive attitude toward foreign students, and especially toward those from developing countries.

He was a friend and follower of Paul W. Richards, CBE, a professor at Bangor and one of Britain\u2019s most outstanding tropical ecologists. In his obituary of Richards, Greig-Smith recalled the establishment by Richards of the MSc course in ecology at Bangor as a program fundamentally directed to meet the needs of students from the tropics<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1995. Obituary: Professor P. W. Richards. ''The Independent'', 11 October 1995.</ref>. After Trinidad, he visited Nigeria in 1966, where he established a long-lasting relationship with the University of Ife as an external examiner. His passion for tropical ecosystems was palpable in the time and effort he devoted to maintain and curate his orchid collection, donated after his death to the [[Treborth Botanic Garden|Treborth Botanical Gardens at Bangor]], as described in [https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL%20Bangoriad%202011%20English.pdf Retallick (2011)]<ref>Retallick, Simon. 2011. Orchids at Treborth Botanic Garden. ''Bangoriad: Bangor University\u2019s Alumni and Friends\u2019 Magazine'' (Spring): 8. Available at: <nowiki>https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL</nowiki> Bangoriad 2011 English.pdf</ref>\n\nGenerous with his time both for students and colleagues, he was very active in scientific societies. In the 1960s and 1970s he served the British Ecological Society as its secretary (1961\u20131963), as editor of the Journal of Ecology (1964\u20131968), and as president (1978\u20131979), with John Maynard-Smith as his vice president. Always concerned about maintaining a separation between scientific results and political views, in his presidential viewpoint address in the Bulletin of the British Ecological Society, he advised younger ecologists not to become too specialized: \u201cInsight so often comes from initially unconsidered information and ideas,\u201d he wrote, urging colleagues to maintain a broad curiosity for the natural world<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1978. Presidential viewpoint. ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 9(1): 2\u20133.</ref>. His time as editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'' was the only period in the society\u2019s recent history where only one editor was selected to shoulder the burden of the task, and he carried out the charge with grace and efficiency.\n\nThe Bangor School of Plant Biology took a strong blow in the 1980s, when the British government introduced an early-retirement scheme for university staff in order to save money and confront the economic crisis for public universities at that time. Both John Harper and Peter Greig-Smith took early retirement, and, although they continued to lecture for a few years, they were no longer responsible for the department, and their participation in the recruitment and teaching of graduate students declined. Greig-Smith's students remember him as a caring mentor with a dry but kind sense of humor. His core values were rigor, objectivity, and service to science. Under his leadership, quantitative ecology flourished in Britain and around the world. His intellectual descendants are scattered over all five continents, and the methods he championed now form a fundamental part of global ecological, environmental, and biological studies.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using<ref></ref> tags, these references will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0089.xml\n\nhttp://treborth.bangor.ac.uk/glasshouses/orchid.php.en\n\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0135.xml\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greig-Smith, Peter}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:2003 deaths]]\n", "text_old": "'''Peter Greig-Smith''' (b. 1922\u2013d. 2003) was a British plant ecologist, founder of the discipline of quantitative ecology in the United Kingdom. He had a deep influence across the world on vegetation studies and plant ecology, mostly from his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', first published in 1957 and a must-read for multiple generations of young ecologists.[[File:Peter Greig-Smith -1988.tif|thumb|Jubilee Symposium for the 75th anniversary of the British Ecological Society at University College, London held on April 12-13 1988.

Front row from left: C.H. Evans; P.R. Richards, J. Harley, R. Southwood.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith was hired by the University College of North Wales at Bangor, Wales (now Bangor University), where he spent the rest of his academic career. His book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' spread the ideas of rigorous, quantitative ecological methods among the world\u2019s research community, and made his lab at Bangor a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in mathematical and statistical methods. A stout supporter of Bangor\u2019s graduate program in Ecology, he recruited and advised many students and research collaborators from all continents.\n\nA prominent member of the British Ecological Society, he was first elected to Council in 1957, and in 1961 he became Honorary Secretary. He held this post until 1964, when he resigned to become editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'', the society\u2019s scientific publication. He remained as editor until 1968. In 1977 he was elected Vice President of the Society, and served as President in 1978 and 1979.\n\n== Mathematics in Ecology ==\nThe postwar period, and especially the 1950s, saw a rising quest for a truly quantitative approach to community ecology. Community description to that point had been predominantly qualitative and had been based mostly on attempts to extend the principles of Linnaean taxonomy into the classification of plant communities. Four innovative ecologists directed their efforts to bring the principles of statistics and mathematics to vegetation analysis: [[John Thomas Curtis|John T. Curtis]] and [[Robert Whittaker|Robert H. Whittaker]] in the United States, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David W. Goodall]] and Peter Greig-Smith in the United Kingdom. J. T. Curtis, in collaboration with [[J. Roger Bray]], developed the first method of community ordination and also developed the idea of ecological dissimilarity or \u201cecological distance measure\u201d that later opened the way to the concept of niche overlap. Robert H. Whittaker was the proponent of gradient analysis to address fundamental questions of how plants use space and resources. He provided foundational elements for a quantitative theory of biodiversity and was most active in the areas of plant community analysis, succession, and productivity. David Goodall worked as a professor of agricultural botany at the University of Reading, where he developed a series of studies on plant sampling, distribution, and multivariate analysis. In 1956, however, Goodall immigrated to Australia, where he led a sixty-year-long and extremely fruitful career, becoming one of the world\u2019s most renowned ecologists. Greig-Smith, eight years younger than Goodall, became the champion of the quantitative approach in plant ecology in Britain.\n\n== Early Work ==\n[[File:AS Watt.tif|thumb|Alexander S. Watt, Greig-Smith's mentor and one of the most influential British ecologists of the 20th Century.]]\nGreig-Smith went to school in Birmingham, United Kingdom, before going to Downing College, Cambridge, where he was inspired by the teachings of [[Alexander Watt|Alexander S. Watt]], the first British botanist to seriously study the phenomenon of pattern and scaling in plant communities from a quantitative perspective. Watt\u2019s influence can be seen in Greig-Smith\u2019s obituaries of him<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. A. S. Watt, F.R.S.: A biographical note. In ''The plant community as a working mechanism: Produced as a tribute to A. S. Watt''. Edited by E. I. Newman, 9\u201310. Special Publication of the British Ecological Society 1.

''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' 35):404\u2013423.</ref>. The ''Biographical Memoirs'' of the Royal Society show that Watt, in turn, had studied at Cambridge under the mentorship of the ecologist Sir [[Arthur Tansley|Arthur G. Tansley]] (1871\u20131955), a direct academic descendant of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]] (Tansley had studied with Francis W. Oliver [1864\u20131951] at the University College, London, who in turn had been mentored by Sir E. Ray Lankester [1847\u20131929] at Cambridge, a student of George Rolleston [1829\u20131881] at Oxford, who had been in turn mentored by Thomas Henry Huxley \u2014\"Darwin's bulldog\"\u2014 in London). In 1944, after graduating from Cambridge, Greig-Smith went to the Imperial College\u2019s Field Station at Slough, where he studied the effect of herbicides on oilseed crops under the direction of the Geoffrey E. Blackman, founder of the science of selective herbicides in Britain. The Slough herbicide tests, part of Britain\u2019s war effort, involved the planting of large-scale experiments with random block and nested designs, an experience that played a central role in nurturing Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in statistical methods and experimental plot designs. In 1945 he moved to the University of Manchester as lecturer in botany. At Manchester, he cultivated a wide array of research interests, ranging from the taxonomy of liverworts and stinging nettles, the causes of spatial pattern in dune plants, the quantitative morphology and tussock formation of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (a dune grass), and the biogeographic distribution of liverworts to understand the fate of vegetation in the British Isles during the last glaciation.\n\n===Dune Ecology===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s first published paper dealt with the varying growth forms of the dune grass ''Ammophila arenaria'' in calcareous sand dunes on the Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Alan R. Gemmell, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1947. Tussock formation in ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L) Link. ''New Phytologist'' 46(2): 262\u2013268.</ref>. This paper was followed two years later by a detailed description of the dune\u2019s plants<ref>Gimingham, Charles H., Alan R. Gemmell, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1949. The vegetation of a sand-dune system in the Outer Hebrides. ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 35(1): 82\u201396.</ref>, using quantitative methods to describe the plant community. These early papers already mark his interest for quantification of natural phenomena. In this morphometric analysis of ''Ammophila arenaria'', for example, Greig-Smith measured in detail the internode length of the plant\u2019s rhizomes and noted the species\u2019 tendency to form tussock-like clumps in older dunes and longer, exploratory rhizomes in unstable, younger dunes.\n\n===Taxonomy and Biogeography===\nSome of Greig-Smith\u2019s early work was devoted to taxonomy and biogeography, trying to bring a quantitative approach to these branches of the biological sciences. Much of his taxonomic work was devoted to the evolutionary taxonomy and ecology of pounceworts (Lejeunaceae, a family of liverworts)<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948b.

In 1950 he published a synthesis paper on the taxonomy and biogeography of liverworts<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1954. Notes on Lejeuneaceae: II. A quantitative assessment of criteria used in distinguishing some British species of ''Lejeunea''. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 2(3): 458\u2013469.</ref>, as an early attempt to shed some light on the question of the effects of Quaternary glaciations on the history of the British flora<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1950. Evidence from hepatics on the history of the British flora. ''Journal of Ecology'' 38(2): 320\u2013344.</ref>. He tried to evaluate how many of the extant British liverworts had survived Pleistocene glaciations ''in situ'' and how many, in contrast, were postglacial migrants from southern latitudes. Almost two decades before the theory of Pleistocene refugia was proposed by [[J\u00fcrgen Haffer]] for the Amazon<ref>Haffer, J\u00fcrgen. 1969. Speciation in Amazonian forest birds. ''Science'' 165(3889): 131\u2013137.</ref>, Greig-Smith was using plant distributions to understand the vegetation changes induced by Pleistocene glaciations, and setting a new direction for Quaternary Paleobotany that few could value in its full significance at that time. As part of the Flora of the British Isles series published in the ''Journal of Ecology'', Greig-Smith drafted a synthesis paper of the natural history of the nettles of the United Kingdom, and a detailed analysis of the communities where they prosper<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948a. Biological flora of the British Isles: ''Urtica'' L. ''Journal of Ecology'' 36(2): 339\u2013355.</ref>.\n\n===Tropical Ecology===\nIn 1940, Paul Richards, Sir Arthur Tansley, and Alexander Watt published a seminal paper<ref>Richards, Paul W., Arthur G. Tansley and Alexander S. Watt. 1940. The recording of structure, life form and flora of tropical forest communities as a basis for their classification. ''Journal of Ecology'' 28(1): 224\u2013239.</ref> on the classification of tropical rainforests revealing a fascination with the complexity of tropical vegetation that was halted by the war, but that Watt passed down later to Greig-Smith, his student at Cambridge. In July 1948 Greig-Smith received a research grant from the Colonial Office to visit the island of Trinidad to study tropical rainforests. Encouraged by E. Ashby, an early pioneer of quantitative methods who was then professor of botany at Manchester, he left the university for six months to study secondary succession in Trinidad, in collaboration with colleagues of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture on the island.\n\nLike Darwin in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, he was gripped by the complexity of tropical forests. In order to try to unravel and explain this complexity, he developed novel statistical methods to test hypotheses on the association between species and the spatial pattern of saplings and adult trees in the field. An avid naturalist, he also developed in Trinidad a passion for orchids, which led him later to start cultivating his own orchid collection in the United Kingdom. After his visit to Trinidad in 1948, Greig-Smith drafted two detailed papers on secondary tropical forests<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952a. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 1. General features of the vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 283\u2013330.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952b. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 2. Structure of the communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 316\u2013330.</ref>. The first study included a number of techniques that at that time were novel in vegetation analysis, such as the species-area plots developed by Ronald A. Fisher and Henry Gleason, size-specific survivorship, and quantitative floristic tables. In the second Trinidad paper, he also used nested analyses of variance (ANOVAs), comparisons with the Poisson distribution, and variance-to-mean ratios to test and understand spatial patterns in the trees of the secondary forest. He concluded his paper questioning Frederic Clement\u2019s concept of plant communities as complex supra-organisms, and in support of Gleason\u2019s individualistic model of plant communities.\n\n== Bangor ==\n[[File:Bangor greenhouses.jpg|thumb|Greenhouses of the School of Plant Biology at Bangor in the mid-1970s. Photo courtesy of Bangor University.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith moved to the [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales at Bangor]], where he spent the rest of his career. After the publication of his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' in 1957, which rapidly spread among the research community and became a success, Bangor became a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in quantitative methods. Greig-Smith was keenly interested in the MSc program in Ecology that Professor Paul W. Richards had developed at Bangor, and advised many Masters' students from where he recruited many doctoral students and research collaborators. Most of the students, postdocs, and research visitors in his lab later became outstanding ecologists in their own right, such as Georg Grabherr (University of Vienna), Kenneth A. Kershaw (who moved to McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario), Michael P. Austin (a postdoc at Bangor, studying tropical forests, who later moved to CSIRO at Canberra, Australia), Robert P. McIntosh (University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci (also a postdoc, later moved to the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada), Timothy F. H. Allen (University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison), Mark O. Hill (Natural Environment Research Council, Swindon, UK), Michael J. Liddle (Monks Wood Experimental Station, Cambridgeshire, UK; later at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia), Michael D. Swaine (University of Aberdeen, Scotland), M. A. Pemadasa (University of Sri Lanka), David J. Gibson (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale), and Tewolde B. G. Egziabher (Environmental Protection Authority, Ethiopia), among many others. The place was a haven for academic exchange: Laszlo Orl\u00f3ci recalls in his biographical memories<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 2019.

Also available at: <nowiki>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334432585</nowiki>)</ref> that during 1964 alone, Greig-Smith\u2019s lab at Bangor received the visit of [[Robert R. Sokal|Robert Sokal]] and [[Peter Sneath]], founders of the discipline of numerical taxonomy, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David Goodall]], William T. Williams, and Mike Dale, who were creating initial content for a solid school of statistical ecology in Australia.\n\n=== Pattern and Scaling in Ecological Sciences ===\n[[File:Scaling design.tif|thumb|In the early 1950s, Greig-Smith started using graphs in which he plotted the variance in plant density versus the size of the sample plot, to find peaks that could identify clump size in aggregated distributions. In doing so, he realized that ecosystem properties are scale-dependent: a species can have a regular distribution at a given scale, but be highly clumped at another.]]\nGreig-Smith was fascinated by the phenomenon of plant spatial pattern, defined by the question: why are some plants regularly spaced while others are densely clumped? He realized that plants could be clumped at a certain scale, but that those clumps, in turn, could be randomly, or even regularly distributed at larger scales. Patterns and processes in ecology, he concluded, can have different behaviors at different scale. Strongly influenced by his early experience in agricultural experiments using random blocks and nested designs, he sought to answer this question by using, as his core tool, a series of quadrats nested within each other at different scales. Much of Greig-Smith\u2019s published work was devoted to advancing the theory and methods of plant pattern, using his nested-quadrat approach as a basic tool. His fundamental idea that the perceived properties of ecological phenomena are scale-dependent set the foundations for the development of a theory of scaling in ecology, a central concept in modern climate change and global sustainability studies.\n\n==== Dunes as Model Ecosystems ====\nOne of Greig-Smith\u2019s early research papers, Gemmell, et al.

After this initial study, the spatial pattern of dunes and grasslands became a lifelong interest in his ecological research, published in a number of papers with collaborators and students<ref>Gemmell, Alan R., Peter Greig-Smith, and Charles H.

The analysis of pattern in vegetation: A comment on a paper by D. W. Goodall. ''Journal of Ecology'' 51(1): 223\u2013229.</ref>, he showed the importance of scaling in the measurement of plant spatial pattern. He understood that researchers sampling the same vegetation with quadrats of different size could reach diametrically opposed conclusions: a researcher using small quadrats would find that his quadrats harbor either clumps or no plants at all, and would conclude that the species pattern in space follows a clumped distribution. Similarly, a researcher using large quadrats would find a similar number of clumps in each quadrat and would conclude that the species distribution is markedly regular. In reality, both would be right because a species can have a strongly clumped distribution at a certain scale and a regular distribution at another. As president of the British Ecological Society, he wrote an address in 1979<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1979. Pattern in vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 67(3): 755\u2013779.</ref>, in which he summarized his ideas on the importance of scaling in ecological spatial pattern. Some of his students took his ideas and pursued them further: Mark Hill developed a rigorous mathematical theory for the analysis of pattern at a community level<ref>Hill, M. O. 1973. The intensity of spatial pattern in plant communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(1): 225\u2013235.</ref>, while Kenneth Kershaw, after publishing in co-authorship with Greig-Smith, continued exploring for years the drivers of pattern at different scales.\n\n====Scaling in Modern Ecology====\nThe fundamental concept that ecological phenomena could have different behaviors when measured at different scales became really important for understanding large-scale phenomena in the biosphere. The Theory of Scaling became a mainstream concept in ecological research in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the publication of two now-classic papers: Wiens 1989<ref>Wiens, John A. 1989. Spatial scaling in ecology. ''Functional Ecology'' 3(4): 385\u2013397.</ref> and [[Simon A. Levin|Simon Levin]] 1992<ref>Levin, Simon A. 1992. The problem of pattern and scale in ecology: The Robert H. McArthur Award Lecture. ''Ecology'' 73(6): 1943\u20131967.</ref>. Greig-Smith, however, had figured out the main concepts four decades before, and both Wiens and Levin recognized him as a scientific pioneer.\n\n=== Multivariate Methods: Classification and Ordination in Ecology ===\nGreig-Smith was among the first ecologists to understand that multivariate methods were destined to become important tools in quantitative plant ecology. His inclusion of multivariate [[Cluster analysis|classification]] and [[Principal component analysis|ordination]] in his book opened the door for the explosion of analytical approaches and methodological discussions that surged in the 1970s and 1980s. As with pattern analysis, Greig-Smith was ahead of his time: although the potential of multivariate methods\u2014based on matrix algebra\u2014was already recognized in the 1950s, mostly as a result of a growing need for more-rigorous methods in ecology, performing an analysis of a modestly sized floristic matrix of, say, fifty sites and one hundred species was a complicated and enormously time-consuming task. The generalized access to electronic computers, which began in the 1960s, opened the doors for the widespread use of these methods; Bangor\u2019s first computer became available in 1964. Greig-Smith saw in multivariate methods an opportunity to analyze and understand the complex floristic composition of tropical forests, which had fascinated him since his visit to Trinidad in 1948. In 1963 he applied for a grant to investigate the use of quantitative methods to establish whether the highly diverse tropical rainforests showed any organized pattern, particularly in relation to environment, an open question at the time. With these funds, in 1964 he appointed Michael Austin as a postdoctoral research assistant to the project. Three seminal papers were published as a result of their collaboration, highlighting the potential of multivariate methods to analyze floristic patterns in complex, multispecies communities<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Michael P. Austin, and Timothy C. Whitmore. 1967. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: I. Association-analysis and principal component ordination of rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 55(2): 483\u2013503.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1968. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: II. Some methodological problems of data from rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 56(3): 827\u2013844.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., Peter S. Ashton, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1972. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: III. A re-examination of rain forest data from Brunei. ''Journal of Ecology'' 60(2): 305\u2013324.</ref>. The power of his approach, merging multivariate descriptive methods with experimental hypothesis testing, is especially noticeable in the work of some of his students like Mike Austin (cited previously), Exequiel Ezcurra<ref>Ezcurra, E. 1987. A comparison of Reciprocal Averaging and Non-Centred Principal Component Analysis. ''Vegetatio'' 71(1): 41\u201348.</ref>, and F.B. Goldsmith<ref>Goldsmith, F. B. 1973a.

The vegetation of exposed sea cliffs at South Stack, Anglesey: II. Experimental studies. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(3): 819\u2013829.</ref>, among others. Mike Austin later moved to Australia and became one of the country\u2019s leading ecologists.\n\n==== Multivariate Methods as Hypothesis-Generating Procedures ====\nHaving laid the foundations of the discipline of multivariate methods, as a committed naturalist and field biologist Greig-Smith never took much interest in abstruse theoretical discussions, always expressing his concern about the risk of becoming too engaged with theoretical refinements of methodology and repeatedly stating his belief that numerical methods are worth developing only if they are to be used on real data in attempts to answer real questions with relevance in the field. The ultimate evidence, for him, was not in the computer output but in the field. In a synthesis paper published in 1980, he insisted that multivariate methods are simply hypothesis-generating procedures, and counseled students to do experimental tests addressing the insights from the classification and ordination analyses rather than taking the results of their analyses as an unchallengeable truth<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1980. The development of numerical classification and ordination. ''Vegetatio'' 42(1\u20133): 1\u20139.</ref>.\n\n==== Novel Approaches to Multivariate Analysis ====\nGreig-Smith\u2019s later papers on multivariate methods, with Mike Swaine<ref>Swaine, Michael D., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1980. An application of principal components analysis to vegetation change in permanent plots. ''Journal of Ecology'' 68(1): 33\u201341.</ref> and Carlos Monta\u00f1a<ref>Monta\u00f1a, Carlos, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1990. Correspondence analysis of species by environmental variable matrices. ''Journal of Vegetation Science'' 1(4): 453\u2013460.</ref>, were devoted to exploring new and innovative applications for multivariate analysis, including the analysis of time-series data and the exploration of the niche preference of species within a community. In the first two decades of the 21st Century, with the advent of powerful computers and large datasets from molecular genetics studies, the methods of numerical classification and eigenvector ordination, promoted by Greig-Smith half a century earlier, exploded in their use to become indispensable tools in the new molecular approaches to taxonomy, genomics, phylogeography, and anthropolgy.\n\n===''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' (book) ===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s most influential work was his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', used by generations of students and young researchers around the world. The book, first published in 1957, enjoyed two subsequent editions in 1964 and 1982<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1957. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1964. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 2d ed. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 3d ed. Studies in Ecology 9. Berkeley: Univ. of California Press.</ref>.\n\nThe success of Greig-Smith\u2019s book triggered the publication of many other similar books, many of them by former Greig-Smith collaborators (such as Kershaw 1964<ref>Kershaw, Kenneth A. 1964. ''Quantitative and dynamic ecology''. New York: American Elsevier.</ref> and Orl\u00f3ci 1975<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 1975. ''Multivariate analysis in vegetation research''. The Hague: W. Junk.</ref>), and nurtured an explosion of concepts and ideas around the quantitative treatment of ecological data, many of which arose in Canada (such as [[E. C. Pielou|Pielou]] 1969<ref>Pielou, Evelyn C. 1969. ''Introduction to Mathematical Ecology''. New York: Wiley-Interscience.</ref>) and Australia (such as Williams 1976<ref>Williams, William T., ed. 1976. ''Pattern analysis in agricultural science''. New York: Elsevier Scientific.</ref>).\n\n=== Holism and Reductionism in Ecology ===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, at the time when the School of Plant Biology at Bangor consolidated as a global magnet for plant ecologists, an active scientific debate, excellently synthesized in Barbour (1996)<ref name=\":0\">Barbour, Michael G. 1996. American ecology and American culture in the 1950s: Who led whom? ''Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America'' 77(1): 44\u201351.</ref>, was taking place worldwide on the role of holism and reductionism as the main tools to understand ecological phenomena. In Britain, this debate centered mostly on the use of descriptive methods or the quest to understand patterns in nature, as opposed to the use of experimental methods or the search for ecological processes. In Bangor, in particular, the most vocal proponent of an experimental and reductionist approach to ecological research was [[John L. Harper]], who often criticized quantitative vegetation scientists on their descriptive, rather than experimental, approach to research. Roy Turkington<ref>Turkington, Roy. 2009. Obituary: Professor John L. Harper FRS CBE (1925\u20132009). ''Journal of Ecology'' 97(5): 835\u2013837.</ref> recalls that Harper strongly favored the power of simple, direct experiments and distrusted complex multivariate methods, often arguing that ordination methods were \u201ca formalized description of consequences.\u201d \u201cNowhere is this holism more apparent than in the way ecology is taught in many schools and universities with its emphasis on complex systems and the ways in which they can be described,\u201d wrote Harper in \u201cAfter Description\u201d<ref>Harper, John L. 1982. After description. In ''The plant community as a working mechanism: Produced as a tribute to A. S. Watt''. Edited by E. I. Newman, 11\u201325. Special Publication of the British Ecological Society 1. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications.</ref>, and he immediately added: \u201cThere is probably no other science in which students are taught by being dropped into the deep end of complexity.\u201d The contrast between experimental ecology in simplified systems, with only one or a few species, against large-scale pattern-seeking methods led Peter Greig-Smith and John Harper into frequent discussions in the form of good-humored debates following departmental seminars in Bangor, which, as amusingly evoked in Hill (2003)<ref>Hill, Mark O. 2003. Peter Greig-Smith (1922\u20132003). ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 34(4): 10\u201311.</ref> and Matlack (2009)<ref>Matlack, Glenn R., ed. 2009. ''Memories of John L. Harper: A remembrance by his friends, students, and colleagues''. 2d ed. Bangor, Wales: SPB. Available online at <nowiki>http://people.virginia.edu/~ja8n/Publications/2011</nowiki> Memories of John L Harper.pdf</ref>, were conducted amid legendary clouds of pipe smoke for the benefit of the students, who could see firsthand how academic arguments conducted both with rigor and humor can be very stimulating and deeply entertaining. \n\nGreig-Smith, however, was not really a holist. From his very first papers on the tropical forests of Trinidad, he embraced Henry Gleason\u2019s \u201cindividualistic\u201d model of plant communities. [[Timothy F. H. Allen|Tim Allen]], a Greig-Smith student in the 1960s, recalls that while in the 1980s \u201cthe use of descriptive multivariate methods degenerated into a ritual that community ecologists were expected to perform\u201d<ref>Allen, Timothy F. H., Amanda J. Zellmer, and C. J. Wuennenberg. 2005. The loss of narrative. In ''Ecological paradigms lost: Routes of theory change''. Edited by Kim Cuddington and Beatrix Beisner, 333\u2013370. Theoretical Ecology 2. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic.</ref>, Greig-Smith insisted that ecological research should always have experimental tests addressing the insights gained and the hypotheses derived from the quantitative analysis, as in Morton (1974)<ref>Morton, Andrew J. 1974. Ecological studies of a fixed dune grassland at Newborough Warren, Anglesey: II. Causal factors of the grassland structure. ''Journal of Ecology'' 62(1): 261\u2013278.</ref>. Perhaps the main difference with Harper\u2019s single-species experimental approach lied in Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in complex, multispecies systems, and his opinion that projects should start with observations and the search for patterns, before establishing hypotheses about the processes that drive ecosystem functions and experimenting to tests these hypotheses. The debates between Harper and Greig-Smith at Bangor had a large influence on the development of ecological theory in the last four decades of the 20th Century.\n\n=== Greig-Smith's Intellectual Progeny ===\nIn Bangor, Greig-Smith took the view that it was up to his students and young postdocs to define the project, develop the scientific hypotheses, and do the work, provided that they included quantitative ecology, his own area of expertise, in their graduate research. He rarely put his own name on his students\u2019 research papers, so that his enormous influence is visible often only in the acknowledgements of published papers. However, some of the papers written by students and researchers while at Greig-Smith\u2019s lab rank among the highest cited in ecology, and owe much of their originality to Greig-Smith\u2019s mentorship<ref>Austin, Michael P., and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci. 1966.

Scientifically, he was a disciplinarian and somewhat of a traditionalist but was also a strong proponent of the separation between scientific positions and political or social points of view. In a letter to Michael Barbour, he wrote: \u201c''There may be parallels between ecology and politics but if so I suspect they are coincidental. I see no parallels between my political or social attitudes and my ecological views''.\"<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Dove, Michael R., and Daniel M. Kammen. 2015. ''Science, society, and the environment: Applying anthropology and physics to sustainability'' (page 11). Routledge (Taylor & Francis Group), London and New York. (ISBN: 978-0-415-71598-0)</ref> Possibly as a result of his work at Trinidad as a young researcher in 1953, he always had a receptive and supportive attitude toward foreign students, and especially toward those from developing countries.

He was a friend and follower of Paul W. Richards, CBE, a professor at Bangor and one of Britain\u2019s most outstanding tropical ecologists. In his obituary of Richards, Greig-Smith recalled the establishment by Richards of the MSc course in ecology at Bangor as a program fundamentally directed to meet the needs of students from the tropics<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1995. Obituary: Professor P. W. Richards. ''The Independent'', 11 October 1995.</ref>. After Trinidad, he visited Nigeria in 1966, where he established a long-lasting relationship with the University of Ife as an external examiner. His passion for tropical ecosystems was palpable in the time and effort he devoted to maintain and curate his orchid collection, donated after his death to the [[Treborth Botanic Garden|Treborth Botanical Gardens at Bangor]], as described in [https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL%20Bangoriad%202011%20English.pdf Retallick (2011)]<ref>Retallick, Simon. 2011. Orchids at Treborth Botanic Garden. ''Bangoriad: Bangor University\u2019s Alumni and Friends\u2019 Magazine'' (Spring): 8. Available at: <nowiki>https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL</nowiki> Bangoriad 2011 English.pdf</ref>\n\nGenerous with his time both for students and colleagues, he was very active in scientific societies. In the 1960s and 1970s he served the British Ecological Society as its secretary (1961\u20131963), as editor of the Journal of Ecology (1964\u20131968), and as president (1978\u20131979), with John Maynard-Smith as his vice president. Always concerned about maintaining a separation between scientific results and political views, in his presidential viewpoint address in the Bulletin of the British Ecological Society, he advised younger ecologists not to become too specialized: \u201cInsight so often comes from initially unconsidered information and ideas,\u201d he wrote, urging colleagues to maintain a broad curiosity for the natural world<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1978. Presidential viewpoint. ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 9(1): 2\u20133.</ref>. His time as editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'' was the only period in the society\u2019s recent history where only one editor was selected to shoulder the burden of the task, and he carried out the charge with grace and efficiency.\n\nThe Bangor School of Plant Biology took a strong blow in the 1980s, when the British government introduced an early-retirement scheme for university staff in order to save money and confront the economic crisis for public universities at that time. Both John Harper and Peter Greig-Smith took early retirement, and, although they continued to lecture for a few years, they were no longer responsible for the department, and their participation in the recruitment and teaching of graduate students declined. Greig-Smith's students remember him as a caring mentor with a dry but kind sense of humor. His core values were rigor, objectivity, and service to science. Under his leadership, quantitative ecology flourished in Britain and around the world. His intellectual descendants are scattered over all five continents, and the methods he championed now form a fundamental part of global ecological, environmental, and biological studies.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using<ref></ref> tags, these references will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0089.xml\n\nhttp://treborth.bangor.ac.uk/glasshouses/orchid.php.en\n\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0135.xml\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greig-Smith, Peter}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:2003 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "Tassedethe", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 - Repaired 1 link to disambiguation page -(You can help)-Robert Whittaker", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Greig-Smith"}
