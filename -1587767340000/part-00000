Wise architects have laid it out, and its people know of no oppression, since all their enemies and adversaries have been put down. Brave is its defence, with many and various strong towers and ramparts, with superb gates and entrance archways; and with the royal citadel in its midst, white walled and deeply moated. Well laid out are its streets, squares, cross roads, and market places. Well displayed are the innumerable sorts of costly merchandise with which its shops are filled. It is richly adorned with hundreds of alms-halls of various kinds; and splendid with hundreds of thousands of magnificent mansions, which rise aloft like the mountain peaks of the [[Himalayas]]. Its streets are filled with elephants, horses, carriages, and foot-passengers, frequented by groups of handsome men and beautiful women, and crowded by men of all sorts and conditions, Brahmans, nobles, artificers, and servants. They resound with cries of welcome to the teachers of every creed, and the city is the resort of the leading men of each of the differing sects. Shops are there for the sale of Benares muslin, of Kotumbara stuffs, and of other cloths of various kinds; and sweet odours are exhaled from the bazaars, where all sorts of flowers and perfumes are tastefully set out. Jewels are there in plenty, such as men's hearts desire, and guilds of traders in all sorts of finery display their goods in the bazaars that face all quarters of the sky. So full is the city of money, and of gold and silver ware, of copper and stone ware, that it is a very mine of dazzling treasures. And there is laid up there much store of property and corn and things of value in warehouses-foods and drinks of every sort, syrups and sweetmeats of every kind.

Wise architects have laid it out, and its people know of no oppression, since all their enemies and adversaries have been put down. Brave is its defence, with many and various strong towers and ramparts, with superb gates and entrance archways; and with the royal citadel in its midst, white walled and deeply moated. Well laid out are its streets, squares, cross roads, and market places. Well displayed are the innumerable sorts of costly merchandise with which its shops are filled. It is richly adorned with hundreds of alms-halls of various kinds; and splendid with hundreds of thousands of magnificent mansions, which rise aloft like the mountain peaks of the [[Himalayas]]. Its streets are filled with elephants, horses, carriages, and foot-passengers, frequented by groups of handsome men and beautiful women, and crowded by men of all sorts and conditions, Brahmans, nobles, artificers, and servants. They resound with cries of welcome to the teachers of every creed, and the city is the resort of the leading men of each of the differing sects. Shops are there for the sale of Benares muslin, of Kotumbara stuffs, and of other cloths of various kinds; and sweet odours are exhaled from the bazaars, where all sorts of flowers and perfumes are tastefully set out. Jewels are there in plenty, such as men's hearts desire, and guilds of traders in all sorts of finery display their goods in the bazaars that face all quarters of the sky. So full is the city of money, and of gold and silver ware, of copper and stone ware, that it is a very mine of dazzling treasures. And there is laid up there much store of property and corn and things of value in warehouses-foods and drinks of every sort, syrups and sweetmeats of every kind.

He spent a great deal of time in Geneva on negotiations in those years, and met his second wife, Barbara, there. In 1980 he was selected to attend the National War College, and was a distinguished graduate there in 1981.  In 1989, he was made chief of the Theater and Strategic Defense Division of ACDA, the office responsible for the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty|ABM Treaty]] and related issues.  He held similar positions and responsibilities after ACDA was merged into the State Department in 1999.

In 1980 he was selected to attend the National War College, and was a distinguished graduate there in 1981.  In 1989, he was made chief of the Theater and Strategic Defense Division of ACDA, the office responsible for the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty|ABM Treaty]] and related issues.

It is part of the [[Olympus OM system]].\n\n==History==\nThe first model was presented at [[photokina 1972|photokina]] in [[Cologne]] in 1972 and was called the '''Olympus M-1'''. Thirteen years earlier, the release of the [[Nikon F]] had made the 35&nbsp;mm SLR the standard choice for professionals accustomed to [[Leica Camera|Leica]] and other rangefinders, but it had driven the market towards heavy and bulky cameras. The Olympus M-1 changed this and with it began a reduction of size, weight and noise of the 35&nbsp;mm SLRs. It was designed by a team led by [[Yoshihisa Maitani]], who had already created the [[Olympus Pen|Pen]] and [[Olympus Pen F|Pen F]] cameras, noted for their compactness.\n\n[[File:Olympus om1 jm2.jpg|left|thumb|Olympus OM-1n with 50mm / f1.8 lens]]\nSince Leica's flagship rangefinder cameras are known as the [[Leica M mount|M Series]], Leica complained about the name of the M-1, forcing Olympus to rename it as the OM-1 to further clarify between the brands.  Because of this, today bodies and lenses with the original M name are rare (52000 bodies were made according to Olympus) and sought after by collectors.\n\nThe OM-1 is an all-mechanical SLR. It has a large viewfinder with interchangeable screens but a fixed prism. It also has a [[Through-the-lens metering|through-the-lens exposure meter]] controlling a needle visible in the viewfinder. It has a compact body, essentially retained on later models. The shutter speed dial is located around the lens mount, which allows photographers to keep the camera at the eye between shots more easily than SLRs with the dial located on the top plate.\n\n[[File:24mmPCleft.jpg|thumb|Olympus OM-1n with 24mm Zuiko-Shift lens]]\nOriginally, the bottom plate needed to be modified to mount a motor drive on the OM-1. In 1974, Olympus launched the '''OM-1MD''' (MD standing for Motor Drive), to which a motor drive can be attached without need for modification. This new version has a small plate marked 'MD' on the front, and a small slot with a circular cover on the underside that covers the motor drive coupling.\n\nThe '''OM-1n''' is similar to the OM-1MD, with a redesigned film advance lever, a flash ready/sufficient flash LED in the viewfinder, and automatic [[flash synchronization]] (X-sync), regardless of the position of the FP/X switch when used with a T-series flash unit mounted on Flash Shoe 4.\n\nProfessional photographers who used the OM-1 include [[Patrick Lichfield]], [[Jane Bown]], [[David Bailey]], [[Josef Koudelka]], [[Chris Bonington]], and [[Kate Garner]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/hardwares/classics/olympusom1n2/om1/ |title= Modern Classic SLRs Series: Olympus OM-1(n) |first= Leo |last= Foo |year= 2000 |work= Photography in Malaysia |accessdate= 16 December 2005 }}\n* {{cite web |url= http://photographic.co.nz/cameraworks/cameras/om1_shutter/|title= Olympus OM-1 shutter|first= Robert Ian |last= Axford |work= Robert Ian Axford's Camera-Works |accessdate= 16 December 2005}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|Olympus OM-1}}\n* [http://www.olympus-global.com/en/corc/history/camera/om/ Olympus History : OM Series] Olympus Corporation History Page.\n* [http://www.arransalerno.com/olympus-m-1/ Olympus M-1] User review and further details.\n\n{{From Camerapedia|Olympus_OM-1/2/3/4|26 May 2006}}\n{{Olympus OM System}}\n\n[[Category:Olympus SLR cameras|OM-1]]\n[[Category:Cameras introduced in 1972]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=February 2012}}\n{{Infobox camera\n | maker       = [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus Optical Co., Ltd]]\n | camera_name = Olympus OM-1\n | image  = Olympus OM-1.jpg\n | caption     = OM-1MD with 50&nbsp;mm f/1.8 lens\n | type        = [[single-lens reflex|SLR]]\n | recording_medium = [[135 film]]\n | lens_mount  = [[Olympus OM system|Olympus OM mount]]\n | lens        = \n | focus       = Manual focus\n | exposure    = Manual\n | shutterRange = 1&nbsp;s \u2013 1/1000&nbsp;s; Bulb\n | flash       = [[Hot shoe]]\n | frame-rate  = manually wound\n | dimensions  = 136 \u00d7 83 \u00d7 50&nbsp;mm\n | weight      = {{convert|510|g|abbr=on}}\n | made_in     = \n | footnotes   = <ref name=\"mediajoy_om-1\">{{cite web|title=Olympus OM-1|url=http://www.mediajoy.com/en/cla_came/olympus-om1/index.html|work=Guide to Classic Cameras|publisher=mediajoy|accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ting|first=Ed|title=Olympus OM1 and OM2 Overview|url=http://www.scopereviews.com/om.html|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=23 June 2008}}</ref> \n}}\nThe '''Olympus OM-1''' is a manually operated [[35mm format|35mm]] [[single-lens reflex]] [[camera]].

The [[Civil Aviation Department (Hong Kong)|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] (CAA) is responsible for the provision of air traffic control services, certification of Taiwan registered aircraft, and the regulation of general [[civil aviation]] activities.\n\nThe airport has two parallel runways, with one 3660 meters in length and another 3800 meters in length and both 60 meters wide, enabling them to cater to the next generation of aircraft. Both runways have been given a [[Instrument Landing System|Category II Precision Approach]], which allows pilots to land in only 350-metre visibility. The two runways have an ultimate capacity of over 60 aircraft movements an hour. The Airport is upgrading ATC and runways.\n\nThere are 41 frontal stands at the main passenger concourse, 15 remote stands and 25 cargo stands. In 2015, the airport was the 11th busiest airport worldwide in terms of international passenger numbers, and 6th busiest in terms of international freight traffic.<ref name=\"ACI Rankings\" />\n\nThe operation of scheduled air services to and from Taoyuan is facilitated by air services agreements between Taiwan and other countries. Since the opening of RCTP, the [[Republic of China Government|Taiwan Government]] has implemented a policy of progressive liberalisation of air services with the intention of promoting consumer choice and competition. Many [[low-cost airlines]] have started various regional routes to compete head-on with full-service carriers on trunk routes.\n\nThe airport's long term expansion opportunities are subject to variables. A NTD 300 billion proposal to build a third runway and a third terminal has been under feasibility study and consultation.\n\n==Airport facilities==\n===Terminal transit===\n[[File:Skytrain-taoyuanairport.gif|thumb|The Skytrain shuttles passengers between Terminals 1 and 2]]\nTransportation between Terminal 1 and 2 is provided by the [[Taoyuan International Airport Skytrain|TTIA Skytrain]], which transports both passengers who have cleared security and those who have not through separate train cars. The other way is by taking [[Taoyuan Airport MRT]], It offers free fare between [[Airport Terminal 1 MRT station|A12]] and [[Airport Terminal 2 MRT station|A13]] and [[Airport Hotel MRT station|Airport Hotel]] with an electronic ticket ([[EasyCard|Easy Card]], [[IPASS (Taiwan)|i-pass]]).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/metro |title=Airport MRT |publisher=Taoyuan Airport |language=en |accessdate=2020-01-15}}</ref>\n\n===Airport Business Center===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\n\nTaiwan Taoyuan International Airport finished developing the airports business travel center in late 2011. The facility is a three-story building located between the first and second terminals. Business travelers paying to use the travel center can drive into the airports restricted zone and park their cars directly in front of the building. This allows business travelers to arrive at the airport much closer to the actual departure time versus arriving two hours before departure time like most regular international passengers are required to do. The business center is equipped with over 15 isolated areas allowing travelers to eat their meals without any distractions or disruptions. The facility also includes a spa, sauna, and gymnasium that are available for use by travelers. However, all of these luxuries come with a one-time price tag of $8,000. Travelers who wish to use the facility must make reservations at least three days in advance. Statistics showed that 376 private jets landed and departed the airport through a six-month timeframe in 2011; this is a 100 percent increase from the same time frame in 2010.\n\n===Huan Yu VIP Terminal===\n\nHuan Yu VIP Terminal, also known as the Taoyuan Business Aviation Centre (TYBAC), began service in September 2011 and was officially opened in mid-October 2011.<ref name=\"buscent\">{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/08/17/2003510955|title=Taoyuan airport readies service for business travelers|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2011-08-17|accessdate=2011-08-16}}</ref> The three-story facility will have its own terminal and facilities separate from the public terminals. It will provide a multimedia conference room, passenger lounge, private rooms and showers, spa, sauna, gym, and business centre facilities.<ref name=\"buscent\" /> Other services that will be provided include ground handling, baggage handling, fuelling, security, customs and flight planning. Passengers planning to utilize TYBAC must sign up (to the Taiwanese immigration service) 3 days before use.\n\n===E-gate===\n[[File:\u81ea\u52d5\u901a\u95dc.png|thumb|The stamp to prove enrollment successfully]]\nPassengers who are citizens of the R.O.C (Taiwan) with valid [[Passport of Taiwan|passports]] or non-citizens who have [[Resident Certificate|ROC (Taiwan) Resident Certificate]] (ARC/APRC) can register with facial features and fingerprints for the E-Gate. After registration, the passengers are able to choose either E-Gate or manual immigration clearance when entering or leaving the country.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/passport-control |title=Passport Control |publisher=Taoyuan Airport |language=en |accessdate=2020-01-15}}</ref>\n\n===Baggage and cargo facilities===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe handling and transportation of mail, passenger baggage, cargo, and the operation of aerobridges and passenger stairways in Taoyuan Airport is provided by [[Taoyuan International Airport Services Limited]] (TIAS) and Evergreen Airline Services (EGAS).\n\nTTIA currently handles over 1.5 million tonnes of cargo annually. There are two air cargo terminals in the airport: one operated by [[Taiwan Air Cargo Terminals Limited]] and the other operated by Evergreen Air Cargo Services.\n\n===Aircraft maintenance services===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\n\nChina Airlines Engineering and Maintenance Organization (CALEMO) and Evergreen Aviation Technologies (EGAT) both offers maintenance services at the airport. With its huge base, CALEMO, with a market share of over 75%, can offer maintenance service of five huge airliners at a time, for example [[Boeing 747]], or three [[Boeing 747]]s and another [[Airbus A330]] at a time. In addition, EGAT is capable of aircraft conversion programs, such as the [[Dreamlifter]] program.\n\n==Ground transportation==\n[[File:Taoyuan mrt emu linkou station 20170302.jpg|thumb|Taoyuan Airport MRT Commuter (left) and Express (right) trains.]]\n\n===Bus===\nFrequent buses link the airport to [[Taipei]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=100150|title=Taipei|publisher=Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|accessdate=2010-06-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204143631/http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=100150|archivedate=2010-12-04}}</ref> [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=100156|title=Taoyuan|publisher=Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|accessdate=2010-06-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430035425/http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=100156|archivedate=2011-04-30}}</ref> [[Zhongli District|Zhongli]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=100158|title=Zhongli|publisher=Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|accessdate=2010-06-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430040626/http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=100158|archivedate=2011-04-30}}</ref> [[Taichung]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=100152|title=Taichung|publisher=Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|accessdate=2010-06-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430035420/http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=100152|archivedate=2011-04-30}}</ref> [[Banqiao District|Banqiao]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=100154|title=Banqiao|publisher=Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|accessdate=2010-06-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430040621/http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=100154|archivedate=2011-04-30}}</ref> [[Changhua]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=100184|title=Changhua|publisher=Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|accessdate=2010-06-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430035431/http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=100184|archivedate=2011-04-30}}</ref> and [[Taiwan High Speed Rail|THSR]]'s [[THSR Taoyuan Station|Taoyuan Station]].<ref name=\"thsrshuttle\">{{cite web|url=http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=1226|title=High Speed Rail Shuttle|publisher=Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|accessdate=2010-06-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204143726/http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=1226|archivedate=2010-12-04}}</ref> Bus terminals are present at both terminals.\n\n===Rail===\n* [[Taoyuan Airport MRT]]: Links both terminals at the airport to [[Taipei]] and [[Zhongli District]], [[Taoyuan City]].

A row of 11 gates are located on the north end of the airfield facing the north runway and another row of 11 gates are located on the south end airfield facing the south runway. The two concourses that contained the airplane gates are linked together by a main building that contained the [[Airport check-in|check-in]] areas, baggage claim, passport immigration areas, and security checkpoint areas. Together they form a giant \"H\". All gates are equipped with [[Jet bridge|jetways]]. Gates located at the end of the concourses have one jetway and also reducing people and gates not located at the end of the concourses have two jetways. The terminal used to be very white in color when it first opened. As the years gradually passed, the fa\u00e7ade and color has become more tan and yellow colored due to air pollution in Taipei.\n\nAfter the completion of Terminal 2, some gates from Terminal 1 were removed to make space for Terminal 2. Currently Terminal 1 has 18 [[Gate (airport)|gates]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/web/english/about/about_e.jsp|title=Taipei Taoyuan International Airport- Basic Information}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Alphabetical letters were introduced when Terminal 2 was completed. The north concourse is now Concourse A and the south concourse is now Concourse B. Before Terminal 2, gates were numbered from 1 to 22. [[China Airlines]] uses Concourse A for the majority of its flights in Terminal 1, while the third largest carrier of the airport, [[Cathay Pacific]], operates most of its flights at Concourse B.\n\nIn 2012, the renovation project of the terminal, designed by Japanese architect Norihiko Dan,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.archdaily.com/771071/regeneration-of-taoyuan-international-airport-terminal-1-norihiko-dan-and-associates|title=Regeneration of Taoyuan International Airport Terminal 1 / Norihiko Dan and Associates|date=2015-08-02|work=ArchDaily|access-date=2017-08-09|language=en-US}}</ref> was completed, doubling the floor area, expanding check-in counters, increasing shopping areas and expanding car-parking facilities. Part of the project was the complete redesigning of both the exterior and interior of the terminal. Capacity of terminal 1 is 15 million passengers per year.\n\n===Terminal 2===\n[[File:Chiang-KaiSheck--InternationalAirport--TaiwanROC.jpg|thumb|Departure Hall]]\n\nTerminal 2 opened in 2000 to reduce heavy congestion in the aging Terminal 1.<ref name=\"basic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=356|title=Basic Information|publisher=Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|accessdate=2010-06-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112055144/http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=356|archivedate=2010-11-12}}</ref> Only the South Concourse had been completed by the time the terminal opened. The South Concourse alone has 10 gates, each with 2 jetways and their own security checkpoints. The North Concourse opened later in 2005, bringing the total number of gates for Terminal 2 to 20 gates; the security checkpoints were moved to a central location in front of the passport control. The 318,000-m<sup>2</sup> facility is capable of handling 17 million passengers per year.<ref name=\"basic\" />\n\nThe Southern and Northern Concourses are also known as Concourse C and Concourse D, respectively. Terminals 1 and 2 are connected by two short [[people mover]] lines, with one from Concourse A to D, and the other from B to C. [[China Airlines]] uses Concourse D for the majority of its flights in Terminal 2 while [[EVA Air]] uses Concourse C for most of its operations.\n\nTerminal 2 recently underwent an [[Taoyuan International Airport#Terminal 2 expansion|expansion project]] that increased the terminal's annual passenger capacity by 5 million to 22 million per annum in 2018.\n\n===Terminal 3 (under construction)===\n{{Further|Taoyuan International Airport#Terminal 3 construction}}\nConstruction of Terminal 3 is part of the expansion project of Taoyuan International Airport.

The [[Civil Aviation Department (Hong Kong)|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] (CAA) is responsible for the provision of air traffic control services, certification of Taiwan registered aircraft, and the regulation of general [[civil aviation]] activities.\n\nThe airport has two parallel runways, with one 3660 meters in length and another 3800 meters in length and both 60 meters wide, enabling them to cater to the next generation of aircraft. Both runways have been given a [[Instrument Landing System|Category II Precision Approach]], which allows pilots to land in only 350-metre visibility. The two runways have an ultimate capacity of over 60 aircraft movements an hour. The Airport is upgrading ATC and runways.\n\nThere are 41 frontal stands at the main passenger concourse, 15 remote stands and 25 cargo stands. In 2015, the airport was the 11th busiest airport worldwide in terms of international passenger numbers, and 6th busiest in terms of international freight traffic.<ref name=\"ACI Rankings\" />\n\nThe operation of scheduled air services to and from Taoyuan is facilitated by air services agreements between Taiwan and other countries. Since the opening of RCTP, the [[Republic of China Government|Taiwan Government]] has implemented a policy of progressive liberalisation of air services with the intention of promoting consumer choice and competition. Many [[low-cost airlines]] have started various regional routes to compete head-on with full-service carriers on trunk routes.\n\nThe airport's long term expansion opportunities are subject to variables. A NTD 300 billion proposal to build a third runway and a third terminal has been under feasibility study and consultation.\n\n==Airport facilities==\n===Terminal transit===\n[[File:Skytrain-taoyuanairport.gif|thumb|The Skytrain shuttles passengers between Terminals 1 and 2]]\nTransportation between Terminal 1 and 2 is provided by the [[Taoyuan International Airport Skytrain|TTIA Skytrain]], which transports both passengers who have cleared security and those who have not through separate train cars. The other way is by taking [[Taoyuan Airport MRT]], It offers free fare between [[Airport Terminal 1 MRT station|A12]] and [[Airport Terminal 2 MRT station|A13]] and [[Airport Hotel MRT station|Airport Hotel]] with an electronic ticket ([[EasyCard|Easy Card]], [[IPASS (Taiwan)|i-pass]]).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/metro |title=Airport MRT |publisher=Taoyuan Airport |language=en |accessdate=2020-01-15}}</ref>\n\n===Airport Business Center===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\n\nTaiwan Taoyuan International Airport finished developing the airports business travel center in late 2011. The facility is a three-story building located between the first and second terminals. Business travelers paying to use the travel center can drive into the airports restricted zone and park their cars directly in front of the building. This allows business travelers to arrive at the airport much closer to the actual departure time versus arriving two hours before departure time like most regular international passengers are required to do. The business center is equipped with over 15 isolated areas allowing travelers to eat their meals without any distractions or disruptions. The facility also includes a spa, sauna, and gymnasium that are available for use by travelers. However, all of these luxuries come with a one-time price tag of $8,000. Travelers who wish to use the facility must make reservations at least three days in advance. Statistics showed that 376 private jets landed and departed the airport through a six-month timeframe in 2011; this is a 100 percent increase from the same time frame in 2010.\n\n===Huan Yu VIP Terminal===\n\nHuan Yu VIP Terminal, also known as the Taoyuan Business Aviation Centre (TYBAC), began service in September 2011 and was officially opened in mid-October 2011.<ref name=\"buscent\">{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/08/17/2003510955|title=Taoyuan airport readies service for business travelers|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2011-08-17|accessdate=2011-08-16}}</ref> The three-story facility will have its own terminal and facilities separate from the public terminals. It will provide a multimedia conference room, passenger lounge, private rooms and showers, spa, sauna, gym, and business centre facilities.<ref name=\"buscent\" /> Other services that will be provided include ground handling, baggage handling, fuelling, security, customs and flight planning. Passengers planning to utilize TYBAC must sign up (to the Taiwanese immigration service) 3 days before use.\n\n===E-gate===\n[[File:\u81ea\u52d5\u901a\u95dc.png|thumb|The stamp to prove enrollment successfully]]\nPassengers who are citizens of the R.O.C (Taiwan) with valid [[Passport of Taiwan|passports]] or non-citizens who have [[Resident Certificate|ROC (Taiwan) Resident Certificate]] (ARC/APRC) can register with facial features and fingerprints for the E-Gate. After registration, the passengers are able to choose either E-Gate or manual immigration clearance when entering or leaving the country.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/passport-control |title=Passport Control |publisher=Taoyuan Airport |language=en |accessdate=2020-01-15}}</ref>\n\n===Baggage and cargo facilities===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe handling and transportation of mail, passenger baggage, cargo, and the operation of aerobridges and passenger stairways in Taoyuan Airport is provided by [[Taoyuan International Airport Services Limited]] (TIAS) and Evergreen Airline Services (EGAS).\n\nTTIA currently handles over 1.5 million tonnes of cargo annually.
