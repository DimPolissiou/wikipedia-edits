It is the first game in the [[Quake (series)|''Quake'' series]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Retro Diary |journal=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |location=[[Bournemouth]] |issue=104 |date=July 2012 |page=13 |issn=1742-3155 |oclc=489477015}}</ref> In the game, players must find their way through various maze-like, medieval environments while battling a variety of monsters using an array of weaponry.  The overall atmosphere is dark and gritty, with lots of stone [[Texture mapping|textures]] and a rusty, capitalized [[font]].\n\nThe successor to id Software's [[Doom (series)|''Doom'' series]], ''Quake'' built upon the technology and gameplay of its predecessor.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Dan|last=Hsu |title=Creature Feature |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=99 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 1997|page=102}}</ref> Unlike the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]] before it, the [[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]] offered full [[Real-time rendering|real-time 3D rendering]] and had early support for [[3D acceleration]] through [[OpenGL]]. After ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' helped to popularize [[multiplayer]] [[deathmatch]]es in 1993, ''Quake'' added various multiplayer options. [[Online multiplayer]] became increasingly common, with the [[QuakeWorld]] update and software such as [[QuakeSpy]] making the process of finding and playing against others on the Internet easier and more reliable.\n\n''Quake'' features music composed by [[Trent Reznor]] and his band, [[Nine Inch Nails]].<ref name=NIN/>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Quake gameplay.png|left|frame|In-game screenshot|alt=]]\nIn ''Quake''{{'s}} single-player mode, players explore and navigate to the exit of each Gothic and dark level, facing monsters and finding secret areas along the way. Usually there are switches to activate or keys to collect in order to open doors before the exit can be reached. Reaching the exit takes the player to the next level. Before accessing an episode, there is a set of three pathways with easy, medium, and hard skill levels. The fourth skill level, \"Nightmare\", was \"so bad that it was hidden, so people won't wander in by accident\";<ref>{{Cite book|title=Quake (game manual)|last=|first=|publisher=ID Software|year=1996|isbn=|location=|page=3}}</ref> the player must drop through water before the episode four entrance and go into a secret passage to access it.\n\n''Quake''{{'s}} single-player campaign is organized into four individual episodes with seven to eight levels in each (including one secret level per episode, one of which is a \"low gravity\" level that challenges the player's abilities in a different way). As items are collected, they are carried to the next level. If the player's character dies, he must restart at the beginning of the level. The game may be saved at any time in the PC versions and between levels in the console versions. Upon completing an episode, the player is returned to the hub \"START\" level, where another episode can be chosen. Each episode starts the player from scratch, without any previously collected items. Episode one (which formed the shareware or downloadable demo version of ''Quake'') has the most traditional ideology of a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] in the last level. The ultimate objective at the end of each episode is to recover a magic rune. After all of the runes are collected, the floor of the hub level opens up to reveal an entrance to the \"END\" level which contains a final puzzle.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nIn multiplayer mode, players on several computers connect to a server (which may be a dedicated machine or on one of the player's computers), where they can either play the single-player campaign together in [[Cooperative_gameplay|co-op (cooperative)]] mode, or play against each other in multiplayer. When players die in multiplayer mode, they can immediately  [[spawning (computer gaming)|respawn]], but will lose any items that were collected. Similarly, items that have been picked up previously respawn after some time, and may be picked up again. The most popular multiplayer modes are all forms of [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]]. Deathmatch modes typically consist of either ''free-for-all'' (no organization or teams involved), one-on-one ''duels'', or organized ''teamplay'' with two or more players per team (or [[clan (computer gaming)|clan]]). Teamplay is also frequently played with one or another [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]]. Monsters are not normally present in teamplay, as they serve no purpose other than to get in the way and reveal the positions of the players.\n\nThe gameplay in ''Quake'' was considered unique for its time because of the different ways the player can maneuver through the game.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} For example: [[bunny hopping]] or [[strafe jumping]] can be used to move faster than normal, while [[rocket jumping]] enables the player to reach otherwise-inaccessible areas at the cost of some self-damage. The player can start and stop moving suddenly, jump unnaturally high, and change direction while moving through the air. Many of these non-realistic behaviors contribute to ''Quake''{{'}}s appeal. Multiplayer ''Quake'' was one of the first games singled out as a form of [[electronic sport]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the 2006 International Conference on Internet Computing and Conference on Computer Games Development, ICOMP '06 : Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, June 26-29, 2006|date=2006|publisher=CSREA Press|others=Arabnia, Hamid R., CGD '06 (2006.06.26-29 Las Vegas, Nev.), Conference on Computer Games Development (2006.06.26-29 Las Vegas, Nev.), ICOMP '06 (2006.06.26-29 Las Vegas, Nev.), International Conference on Internet Computing (2006.06.26-29 Las Vegas, Nev.)|isbn=1-60132-005-1|location=[Erscheinungsort nicht ermittelbar]|oclc=255355771}}</ref> A notable participant was [[Dennis Fong]] who won [[John Carmack]]'s [[Ferrari 328]] at the Microsoft-sponsored [[Red Annihilation]] tournament in 1997.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the single-player game, the player takes the role of the protagonist known as Ranger (voiced by [[Trent Reznor]])<ref>{{cite tweet |user=romero |last=Romero |first=John |number=571185625879048194 |date=February 26, 2015 |title=@branrags @Zyargeikunn : Trent Reznor did all the player sounds.}}</ref> who was sent into a portal in order to stop an enemy [[code-name]]d \"Quake\". The government had been experimenting with teleportation technology and developed a working prototype called a \"Slipgate\"; the mysterious Quake compromised the Slipgate by connecting it with its own teleportation system, using it to send death squads to the \"Human\" dimension in order to test the martial capabilities of humanity.\n\nThe sole surviving protagonist in \"Operation Counterstrike\" is Ranger, who must advance, starting each of the four episodes from an overrun human military base, before fighting his way into other dimensions, reaching them via the Slipgate or their otherworld equivalent. After passing through the Slipgate, Ranger's main objective is to collect four magic runes from four dimensions of Quake; these are the key to stopping the enemy later discovered as [[Shub-Niggurath]] and ending the invasion of Earth.\n\nThe single-player campaign consists of 30 separate levels, or \"maps\", divided into four episodes (with a total of 26 regular maps and four secret ones), as well as a hub level to select a difficulty setting and episode, and the game's final boss level. Each episode represents individual dimensions that the player can access through magical portals (as opposed to the technological Slipgate) that are discovered over the course of the game. The various realms consist of a number of [[Gothic architecture|gothic]], [[Middle Ages|medieval]], and lava-filled caves and dungeons, with a recurring theme of hellish and satanic imagery reminiscent of ''Doom'' (such as pentagrams and images of demons on the walls). The game's setting is inspired by several [[dark fantasy]] influences, most notably that of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. Dimensional Shamblers appear as enemies, the \"Spawn\" enemies are called \"Formless Spawn of [[Tsathoggua]]\" in the manual, the [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] of the first episode is named [[Chthonian (Cthulhu Mythos)|Chthon]], and the main villain is named Shub-Niggurath (though actually resembling a [[Dark Young]]). Some levels have Lovecraftian names, such as the Vaults of Zin and [[The Nameless City]]. In addition, six levels exclusively designed for multiplayer deathmatch are also included. Originally, the game was supposed to include more Lovecraftian bosses, but this concept was scrapped due to time constraints.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Quake - family tree.svg|thumb|Family graph of ''Quake'' engines]]\n[[File:Quake - family tree 2.svg|thumb|''Quake'' family graph, showing games and engines based on id Tech 2]]\n\nA preview included with [[id Software|id]]'s very first release, 1990's ''[[Commander Keen]]'', advertised a game entitled ''The Fight for Justice'' as a follow-up to the ''Commander Keen'' trilogy. It would feature a character named Quake, \"the strongest, most dangerous person on the continent\", armed with thunderbolts and a \"Ring of Regeneration\". Conceived as a [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] full-color [[Side-scrolling game|side-scrolling]] [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]], ''The Fight for Justice'' was never released.\n\nLead designer and director [[John Romero]] later conceived of ''Quake'' as an [[action game]] taking place in a fully [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world, inspired by [[Sega AM2]]'s 3D [[fighting game]] ''[[Virtua Fighter]]''. ''Quake'' was also intended to feature ''Virtua Fighter'' influenced third-person [[Beat 'em up|melee combat]]. However, id Software considered it to be risky. Because the project was taking too long, the third-person melee was eventually dropped. This led to creative differences between Romero and id Software, and eventually his departure from the company after ''Quake'' was released.<ref name=\"nextgen\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=30|date=June 1997|pages=9\u201312|title=Does John Romero Still Enjoy Shooting People? |url=https://archive.org/stream/NextGeneration30Jun1997/Next_Generation_30_Jun_1997#page/n9/mode/2up}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Edge|issue=45 |date=May 1997|quote=My original idea was to do something like ''Virtua Fighter'' in a 3D world, with full-contact fighting, but you'd also be able to run through a world, and do the same stuff you do in ''Quake'', only when you got into these melees, the camera would pull out into a third-person perspective.

However, work was very slow on the engine, since [[John Carmack]], the main programmer of ''Quake'', was not only developing a fully 3D engine, but also a TCP/IP networking model (Carmack later said that he should have done two separate projects which developed those things).{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Working with a game engine that was still in development presented difficulties for the designers.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Great Escape |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=34|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=October 1997|page=44}}</ref>\n\nEventually, the whole id Software team began to think that the original concept may not have been as wise a choice as they first believed.<ref name=\"Max6\"/> Thus, the final game was very stripped down from its original intentions, and instead featured gameplay similar to ''Doom'' and its sequel, although the levels and enemies were closer to medieval RPG style rather than science-fiction. In a December 1, 1994 post to an online bulletin board, John Romero wrote, \"Okay, people. It seems that everyone is speculating on whether Quake is going to be a slow, RPG-style light-action game. Wrong! What does id do best and dominate at? Can you say \"action\"? I knew you could.

The levels and scenarios were designed by [[American McGee]], [[Sandy Petersen]], John Romero, and [[Tim Willits]], and the graphics were designed by [[Adrian Carmack]], [[Kevin Cloud]] and [[Paul Steed]]. Cloud created the monster and player graphics using [[PowerAnimator|Alias]].<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Earth-Quake!|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=5 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=April 1996|pages=124\u20139}}</ref>\n\nThe [[game engine]] developed for ''Quake'', the [[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]], popularized several major advances in the first-person shooter genre: polygonal models instead of [[prerendered]] [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]; full 3D level design instead of a [[2.5D]] map; [[prerendered]] [[lightmap]]s; and allowing end users to partially program the game (in this case with [[QuakeC]]), which popularized fan-created [[Mod (computer gaming)|modifications (mods)]].\n\nBefore the release of the full game or the shareware version of ''Quake'', id Software released ''QTest'' on February 24, 1996. It was described as a technology demo and was limited to three multiplayer maps. There was no single-player support and some of the gameplay and graphics were unfinished or different from their final versions. ''QTest'' gave gamers their first peek into the filesystem and modifiability of the ''Quake'' engine, and many entity mods (that placed monsters in the otherwise empty multiplayer maps) and custom player skins began appearing online before the full game was even released.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/blast-from-the-past-iii-quaking-in-fear|title=Blast from the Past III: Quaking in Fear|author=Pete Davison|publisher=[[USgamer]]|date=August 2, 2013|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the game was designed so that when the player ran out of ammunition, the player character would hit enemies with a [[gun-butt]].<ref name=\"Max6\"/> Shortly before release this was replaced with an [[axe]].\n\n=== Music and sound design ===\n{{Main|Quake (original soundtrack)}}\n''Quake''{{'}}s music and sound design was done by [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]], using ambient soundscapes and synthesized [[drone (music)|drone]]s to create atmospheric tracks.

It also contains an exclusive unlockable, \"Dank & Scuz\", which is a story set in the Quake milieu and presented in the form of a [[slide show]] with voice acting. There are no multiplayer modes in the Sega Saturn version; as a result of this, all of the deathmatch maps from the PC version were removed from the Sega Saturn port. The Nintendo 64 version includes 25 single-player levels from the PC version, though it is missing The Grisly Grotto (E1M4), The Installation (E2M1), The Ebon Fortress (E2M4), The Wind Tunnels (E3M5), The Sewage System (E4M1), and Hell's Atrium (E4M5) levels. It also does not use the hub \"START\" map where the player chooses a difficulty level and an episode; the difficulty level is chosen from a menu when starting the game, and all of the levels are played in sequential order from The Slipgate Complex (E1M1) to Shub Niggurath's Pit (END). The Nintendo 64 version, while lacking the cooperative multiplayer mode, includes two player deathmatch. All six of the deathmatch maps from the PC version are in the Nintendo 64 port, and an exclusive deathmatch level, The Court of Death, is also included.\n\nTwo ports of ''Quake'' for the Nintendo DS exist, ''QuakeDS''<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://quake.drunkencoders.com|title=QuakeDS|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803133158/http://quake.drunkencoders.com/|archivedate=August 3, 2009}}</ref> and ''CQuake''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://code.google.com/p/cquake/ | title=CQuake Project | accessdate=November 24, 2011}}</ref> Both run well, however, multiplayer does not work on ''QuakeDS''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Since the source code for ''Quake'' was released, a number of unofficial ports have been made available for PDAs and mobile phones, such as PocketQuake, as well as versions for the Symbian S60 series of mobile phones and Android mobile phones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quake.pocketmatrix.com/ |title=Home \u2013 ''Pocket Quake'' |publisher=Pocketmatrix.com |accessdate=November 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130163542/http://quake.pocketmatrix.com/ |archivedate=November 30, 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.simplysymbian.com/2007/09/10/how-to-install-and-play-quake-on-your-symbian-phone/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915192209/http://www.simplysymbian.com/2007/09/10/how-to-install-and-play-quake-on-your-symbian-phone/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 15, 2007 |title=How to: Install and play ''Quake'' on your Symbian Phone! |publisher=SimplySymbian.com |date=September 10, 2007 |author=Soltani, Dario }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=689716 |title=Quake for Android |publisher=Forum.xda-developers.com |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}</ref> The [[Rockbox]] project also distributes a version of ''Quake'' that runs on some MP3 players.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rockbox.org/wiki/PluginQuake |publisher=Rockbox project |accessdate=10 August 2019|title=PluginQuake < Main < Wiki }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, id Software signed a deal with publisher Pulse Interactive to release a version of ''Quake'' for mobile phones.

The first mods were small gameplay fixes and patches initiated by the community, usually enhancements to weapons or gameplay with new enemies. Later mods were more ambitious and resulted in ''Quake'' fans creating versions of the game that were drastically different from id Software's original release.\n\nThe first major ''Quake'' mod was ''[[Team Fortress]]''. This mod consists of Capture the Flag gameplay with a class system for the players. Players choose a class, which creates various restrictions on weapons and armor types available to that player, and also grants special abilities. For example, the bread-and-butter ''Soldier'' class has medium armor, medium speed, and a well-rounded selection of weapons and grenades, while the ''Scout'' class is lightly armored, very fast, has a scanner that detects nearby enemies, but has very weak offensive weapons. One of the other differences with CTF is the fact that the flag is not returned automatically when a player drops it: running over one's flag in ''Threewave CTF'' would return the flag to the base, and in ''TF'' the flag remains in the same spot for preconfigured time and it has to be defended on remote locations. This caused a shift in defensive tactics compared to ''Threewave CTF''. ''Team Fortress'' maintained its standing as the most-played online ''Quake'' modification for many years.\n\nAnother popular mod was ''[[Threewave Software|Threewave]] [[Capture the Flag]]'' (CTF), primarily authored by Dave 'Zoid' Kirsch. ''Threewave CTF'' is a [[partial conversion]] consisting of new levels, a new weapon (a [[grappling hook]]), power-ups, new [[texture mapping|textures]], and new gameplay rules. Typically, two teams (red and blue) would compete in a game of [[Capture the flag]], though a few maps with up to four teams (red, blue, green, and yellow) were created. Capture the Flag soon became a standard game mode included in most popular multiplayer games released after ''Quake''. ''[[Rocket Arena]]'' provides the ability for players to face each other in small, open arenas with changes in the gameplay rules so that item collection and detailed level knowledge are no longer factors. A series of short rounds, with the surviving player in each round gaining a point, instead tests the player's aiming and dodging skills and reflexes. ''Clan Arena'' is a further modification that provides team play using ''Rocket Arena'' rules. One mod category, \"[[Computer game bot|bots]]\", was introduced to provide surrogate players in multiplayer mode.\n\n''Arcane Dimensions'' is a singleplayer mod. It's a partial conversion with breakable objects and walls, enhanced particle system, numerous visual improvements and new enemies and weapons. The level design is much more complex in terms of geometry and gameplay than in the original game.<ref name=\"ad\">{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Alec |title=Arcane Dimensions Is Quake Rethought For 2016 |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/07/20/best-quake-mod-2016/ |website=RockPaperShotgun |accessdate=October 18, 2018 |date=July 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ferrari |first1=Lily |title=Review - QUAKE - Arcane Dimensions Mod v1.70 puts AAA FPS to shame! |url=https://goodmorninggamers.blogspot.com/2018/05/review-arcane-dimensions-mod-v170.html |website=Good Morning Gamers |accessdate=October 18, 2018 |date=May 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are a large number of custom levels that have been made by users and fans of ''Quake''. {{As of|2019}}, new maps are still being made, over twenty years since the game's release.

(Atari, SA subsidiary)|GT Interactive]]. These shareware copies could be converted into complete versions through passwords purchased via phone. However, Kushner wrote that \"gamers wasted no time hacking the shareware to unlock the full version of the game for free.\" This problem, combined with the scale of the operation, led id Software to cancel the plan. As a result, the company was left with 150,000 unsold shareware copies in storage. The venture damaged ''Quake''{{'}}s initial sales and caused its retail push by GT Interactive to miss the holiday shopping season. Following the game's full release, Kushner remarked that its early \"sales were good \u2014 with 250,000 units shipped \u2014 but not a phenomenon like ''Doom II''.\"<ref name=\"mastersdoom\">{{cite book | last=Kushner | first=David | title=Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created An Empire And Transformed Pop Culture | publisher=[[Random House]] | at=226 | year=2003 | isbn=0-375-50524-5 | title-link=Masters of Doom }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, ''Quake'' placed sixth on [[PC Data]]'s monthly computer game sales charts for November and December 1996.<ref name=novdec96>{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] | title=PC Data Best-Sellers |date=April 1997 | issue=153 | pages=32 }}</ref> Its shareware edition was the sixth-best-selling computer game of 1996 overall, while its retail [[Stock keeping unit|SKU]] claimed 20th place.<ref name=cgm1996sales>{{cite journal | author=Bauman, Steve | journal=[[Computer Games Magazine]] | title=A Decade of Gaming;

The footage was edited into a continuous 19 minutes, 49 seconds demo called ''Quake done Quick'' and released on June 10, 1997. Owners of ''Quake'' could replay this demo in the game engine, watching the run unfold as if they were playing it themselves.\n\nThis involved a number of players recording run-throughs of individual levels, using every trick and shortcut they could discover in order to minimize the time it took to complete, usually to a degree that even the original level designers found difficult to comprehend, and in a manner that often bypassed large areas of the level. Stitching a series of the fastest runs together into a coherent whole created a demonstration of the entire game. ''Recamming'' is also used with speedruns in order to make the experience more movie-like, with arbitrary control of camera angles, editing, and sound that can be applied with editing software after the runs are first recorded. However, the fastest possible time for a given level will not necessarily result in the fastest time used to contribute to \"running\" the entire game. One example is acquiring the grenade launcher in an early level, an act that slows down the time for that level over the best possible, but speeds up the overall game time by allowing the runner to bypass a big area in a later level that they could not otherwise do.\n\nA second attempt, ''Quake done Quicker'', reduced the completion time to 16 minutes, 35 seconds (a reduction of 3 minutes, 14 seconds). ''Quake done Quicker'' was released on September 13, 1997. One of the levels included was the result of an online competition to see who could get the fastest time. The culmination of this process of improvement was ''Quake done Quick with a Vengeance''. Released three years to the day after ''Quake done Quicker'', this pared down the time taken to complete all four episodes, on Nightmare (hardest) difficulty, to 12 minutes, 23 seconds (a further reduction of 4 minutes, 12 seconds), partly by using techniques that had formerly been shunned in such films as being less aesthetically pleasing. This run was recorded as an in-game demo, but interest was such that an [[Audio Video Interleave|.avi]] video clip was created to allow those without the game to see the run.\n\nMost full-game speedruns are a collaborative effort by a number of runners (though some have been done by single runners on their own). Although each particular level is credited to one runner, the ideas and techniques used are iterative and collaborative in nature, with each runner picking up tips and ideas from the others, so that speeds keep improving beyond what was thought possible as the runs are further optimized and new tricks or routes are discovered. Further time improvements of the continuous whole game run were achieved into the 21st century. In addition, many thousands of individual level runs are kept at [[Speed Demos Archive]]'s ''Quake'' section, including many on custom maps. Speedrunning is a counterpart to multiplayer modes in making ''Quake'' one of the first games promoted as a virtual sport.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe [[source code]] of the ''Quake'' and ''[[QuakeWorld]]'' engines was licensed under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] on December 21, 1999. The id Software maps, objects, textures, sounds, and other creative works remain under their original proprietary license. The [[shareware]] distribution of ''Quake'' is still freely redistributable and usable with the GPLed engine code. One must purchase a copy of ''Quake'' in order to receive the registered version of the game which includes more single-player episodes and the [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] maps. Based on the success of the first ''Quake'' game, and later published ''[[Quake II]]'' and ''[[Quake III Arena]]''; ''[[Quake 4]]'' was released in October 2005, developed by [[Raven Software]] using the ''[[Doom 3]]'' engine.\n\n''Quake'' was the game primarily responsible for the emergence of the [[machinima]] artform of films made in game engines, thanks to edited ''Quake'' demos such as ''[[Ranger Gone Bad]]'' and ''[[Blahbalicious]]'', the in-game film ''The Devil's Covenant'', and the in-game-rendered, four-hour epic film ''[[The Seal of Nehahra]]''. On June 22, 2006, it had been 10 years since the original uploading of the game to [[cdrom.com]] archives. Many [[Internet forum]]s had topics about it, and it was a front-page story on [[Slashdot]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://slashdot.org/story/06/06/23/1755244/quake-is-10 |title=''Quake'' is 10 \u2013 Slashdot |publisher=[[Geeknet]] |work=[[Slashdot]] |date=June 23, 2006 |author=timothy}}</ref> On October 11, 2006, [[John Romero]] released the original map files for all of the levels in ''Quake'' under the GPL.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rome.ro/2006/10/quake-map-sources-released.html |title=''Quake'' Map Sources Released! |publisher=Rome.ro |date=October 11, 2006 |author=Romero, John |authorlink=John Romero |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022171208/http://rome.ro/2006/10/quake-map-sources-released.html |archivedate=October 22, 2006}}</ref>\n\n''Quake'' has four sequels: ''Quake II'', ''Quake III Arena'', ''Quake 4'', and ''[[Enemy Territory: Quake Wars]]''.

Unlike the main ''Quake'' game and Mission Pack No. 2, ''Scourge'' does away with the episode hub, requiring the three episodes to be played sequentially. The three new enemies include Centroids, large cybernetic scorpions with nailguns; Gremlins, small goblins that can steal weapons and multiply by feeding on enemy corpses; and Spike Mines, floating orbs that detonate when near the player. The three new weapons include the Mjolnir, a large lightning emitting hammer; the Laser Cannon, which shoots bouncing bolts of energy; and the Proximity Mine Launcher, which fires grenades that attach to surfaces and detonate when an opponent comes near. The three new power-ups include the Horn of Conjuring, which summons an enemy to protect the player; the Empathy Shield, which halves the damage taken by the player between the player and the attacking enemy; and the Wetsuit, which renders the player invulnerable to electricity and allows the player to stay underwater for a period of time. The storyline follows Armagon, a general of Quake's forces, planning to invade [[Earth]] via a portal known as the 'Rift'. Armagon resembles a giant gremlin with cybernetic legs and a combined [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launcher]]/[[laser cannon]] for arms.\n\nTim Soete of ''[[GameSpot]]'' gave it a score 8.6 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web |last=Soete |first=Tim |title=Quake Mission Pack: Scourge of Armagon Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/quake-mission-pack-scourge-of-armagon-review/1900-2532927/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=December 1, 2018 |date=November 9, 2000}}</ref>\n\n===''Quake Mission Pack No. 2: Dissolution of Eternity''===\n''Quake Mission Pack No. 2: Dissolution of Eternity'' was the second official mission pack, released on March 19, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamecenter.com/News/Item/0,3,0-674,00.html|title=Game pieces--Blood patch is out!|last=Smith|first=Erica|date=March 19, 1997|website=[[CNET#Gamecenter|CNET Gamecenter]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817195734/http://www.gamecenter.com/News/Item/0,3,0-674,00.html|archive-date=August 17, 2000|url-status=dead|access-date=December 5, 2019}}<br>'''Quake Mission Pack 2''': \"With a quick one-two punch, Activision is already announcing the release of the second Quake Mission Pack.\"</ref> Developed by [[Rogue Entertainment]], it features two episodes divided into fifteen new single-player levels, a new multiplayer level, a new soundtrack, and several new enemies and bosses. Notably, the pack lacks secret levels. The eight new enemies include Electric Eels, Phantom Swordsmen, Multi-Grenade Ogres (which fire cluster grenades), Hell Spawn, Wraths (floating, robed undead), Guardians (resurrected ancient Egyptian warriors), Mummies, and statues of various enemies that can come to life. The four new types of bosses include Lava Men, Overlords, large Wraths, and a dragon guarding the \"temporal energy converter\". The two new power-ups include the Anti Grav Belt, which allows the player to jump higher; and the Power Shield, which lowers the damage the player receives. Rather than offering new weapons, the mission pack gives the player four new types of ammo for existing weapons, such as \"lava nails\" for the Nailgun, cluster grenades for the Grenade Launcher, rockets that split into four in a horizontal line for the Rocket Launcher, and plasma cells for the Thunderbolt, as well as a grappling hook to help with moving around the levels.\n\nTim Soete of ''[[GameSpot]]'' gave it a score of 7.7 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web |last=Soete |first=Tim |title=Quake Mission Pack: Dissolution of Eternity Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/quake-mission-pack-dissolution-of-eternity-review/1900-2539746/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=December 1, 2018 |date=November 9, 2000}}</ref>\n\n===''VQuake''===\nIn late 1996, id Software released ''VQuake'', a port of the ''Quake'' engine to support hardware accelerated rendering on graphics cards using the [[Rendition V\u00e9rit\u00e9]] chipset. Aside from the expected benefit of improved performance, ''VQuake'' offered numerous visual improvements over the original software-rendered ''Quake''. It boasted full 16-bit color, bilinear filtering (reducing pixelation), improved dynamic lighting, optional anti-aliasing, and improved source code clarity, as the improved performance finally allowed the use of gotos to be abandoned in favor of proper loop constructs. As the name implied, ''VQuake'' was a proprietary port specifically for the V\u00e9rit\u00e9; consumer 3D acceleration was in its infancy at the time, and there was no standard 3D API for the consumer market. After completing ''VQuake'', John Carmack vowed to never write a proprietary port again, citing his frustration with Rendition's [[Redline (API)|Speedy3D]] API.\n\n===''QuakeWorld''===\n{{Main|QuakeWorld}}\nTo improve the quality of online play, id Software released ''[[QuakeWorld]]'' on December 17, 1996, a build of ''Quake'' that featured significantly revamped network code including the addition of [[client-side prediction]]. The original ''Quake''{{'s}} network code would not show the player the results of his actions until the server sent back a reply acknowledging them. For example, if the player attempted to move forward, his client would send the request to move forward to the server, and the server would determine whether the client was actually able to move forward or if he ran into an obstacle, such as a wall or another player. The server would then respond to the client, and only then would the client display movement to the player. This was fine for play on a LAN, a high bandwidth, very low latency connection, but the latency over a dial-up Internet connection is much larger than on a LAN, and this caused a noticeable delay between when a player tried to act and when that action was visible on the screen. This made gameplay much more difficult, especially since the unpredictable nature of the Internet made the amount of delay vary from moment to moment. Players would experience jerky, laggy motion that sometimes felt like ice skating, where they would slide around with seemingly no ability to stop, due to a build-up of previously-sent movement requests. John Carmack has admitted that this was a serious problem which should have been fixed before release, but it was not caught because he and other developers had high-speed Internet access at home.\n\nWith the help of [[client-side prediction]], which allowed players to see their own movement immediately without waiting for a response from the server, ''QuakeWorld''{{'s}} network code allowed players with high-latency connections to control their character's movement almost as precisely as when playing in single-player mode. The [[Netcode]] parameters could be adjusted by the user so that ''QuakeWorld'' performed well for users with high and low latency.\n\nThe trade off to client-side prediction was that sometimes other players or objects would no longer be quite where they had appeared to be, or, in extreme cases, that the player would be pulled back to a previous position when the client received a late reply from the server which overrode movement the client had already previewed; this was known as \"warping\". As a result, some serious players, particularly in the U.S., still preferred to play online using the original ''Quake'' engine (commonly called ''NetQuake'') rather than ''QuakeWorld''. However, the majority of players, especially those on dial-up connections, preferred the newer network model, and ''QuakeWorld'' soon became the dominant form of online play. Following the success of ''QuakeWorld'', client-side prediction has become a standard feature of nearly all real-time online games. As with all other ''Quake'' upgrades, ''QuakeWorld'' was released as a free, unsupported add-on to the game and was updated numerous times through 1998.\n\n===''GLQuake''===\nOn January 22, 1997, id Software released ''GLQuake''. This was designed to use the [[OpenGL]] 3D [[Application programming interface|API]] to access hardware 3D graphics acceleration cards to [[rasterization|rasterize]] the graphics, rather than having the computer's [[CPU]] fill in every [[pixel]]. In addition to higher framerates for most players, ''GLQuake'' provided higher [[display resolution|resolution]] modes and [[texture filtering]]. ''GLQuake'' also experimented with reflections, transparent water, and even rudimentary shadows. ''GLQuake'' came with a [[MiniGL|driver]] enabling the subset of OpenGL used by the game to function on the [[3dfx]] ''[[Voodoo Graphics]]'' card, the only consumer-level card at the time capable of running ''GLQuake'' well. Previously, John Carmack had experimented with a version of Quake specifically written for the [[Rendition V\u00e9rit\u00e9]] chip used in the [[Creative Labs]] ''PCI 3D Blaster'' card. This version had met with only limited success, and Carmack decided to write for generic APIs in the future rather than tailoring for specific hardware.\n\n===''WinQuake''===\nOn March 11, 1997, id Software released ''WinQuake'', a version of the non-OpenGL engine designed to run under [[Microsoft Windows]]; the original ''Quake'' had been written for [[DOS]], allowing for launch from [[Windows 95]], but could not run under [[Windows NT]]-based operating systems because it required direct access to hardware. ''WinQuake'' instead accessed hardware via [[Win32]]-based APIs such as [[DirectSound]], [[DirectInput]], and [[DirectDraw]] that were supported on Windows 95, [[Windows NT 4.0]] and later releases. Like ''GLQuake'', ''WinQuake'' also allowed higher resolution video modes. This removed the last barrier to widespread popularity of the game. In 1998, LBE Systems and Laser-Tron released ''Quake: Arcade Tournament Edition'' in the arcades in limited quantities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9188 |title=''Quake'' \u2013 Arcade Tournament Edition |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===''Dimension of the Past''===\nTo celebrate ''Quake''{{'}}s 20th anniversary, a mission pack was developed by [[MachineGames]] and released on June 24, 2016.

''[[Quake 4]]'' followed the design themes of ''Quake II'', whereas ''Quake III Arena'' mixed these styles; it had a parallel setting that housed several \"id all-stars\" from various games as playable characters.

[[Online multiplayer]] became increasingly common, with the [[QuakeWorld]] update and software such as [[QuakeSpy]] making the process of finding and playing against others on the Internet easier and more reliable.\n\n''Quake'' features music composed by [[Trent Reznor]] and his band, [[Nine Inch Nails]].<ref name=NIN/>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Quake gameplay.png|left|frame|In-game screenshot|alt=]]\nIn ''Quake''{{'s}} single-player mode, players explore and navigate to the exit of each Gothic and dark level, facing monsters and finding secret areas along the way. Usually there are switches to activate or keys to collect in order to open doors before the exit can be reached. Reaching the exit takes the player to the next level. Before accessing an episode, there is a set of three pathways with easy, medium, and hard skill levels. The fourth skill level, \"Nightmare\", was \"so bad that it was hidden, so people won't wander in by accident\";<ref>{{Cite book|title=Quake (game manual)|last=|first=|publisher=ID Software|year=1996|isbn=|location=|page=3}}</ref> the player must drop through water before the episode four entrance and go into a secret passage to access it.\n\n''Quake''{{'s}} single-player campaign is organized into four individual episodes with seven to eight levels in each (including one secret level per episode, one of which is a \"low gravity\" level that challenges the player's abilities in a different way). As items are collected, they are carried to the next level. If the player's character dies, he must restart at the beginning of the level. The game may be saved at any time in the PC versions and between levels in the console versions. Upon completing an episode, the player is returned to the hub \"START\" level, where another episode can be chosen. Each episode starts the player from scratch, without any previously collected items. Episode one (which formed the shareware or downloadable demo version of ''Quake'') has the most traditional ideology of a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] in the last level. The ultimate objective at the end of each episode is to recover a magic rune. After all of the runes are collected, the floor of the hub level opens up to reveal an entrance to the \"END\" level which contains a final puzzle.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nIn multiplayer mode, players on several computers connect to a server (which may be a dedicated machine or on one of the player's computers), where they can either play the single-player campaign together in [[Cooperative_gameplay|co-op (cooperative)]] mode, or play against each other in multiplayer. When players die in multiplayer mode, they can immediately  [[spawning (computer gaming)|respawn]], but will lose any items that were collected. Similarly, items that have been picked up previously respawn after some time, and may be picked up again. The most popular multiplayer modes are all forms of [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]]. Deathmatch modes typically consist of either ''free-for-all'' (no organization or teams involved), one-on-one ''duels'', or organized ''teamplay'' with two or more players per team (or [[clan (computer gaming)|clan]]). Teamplay is also frequently played with one or another [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]]. Monsters are not normally present in teamplay, as they serve no purpose other than to get in the way and reveal the positions of the players.\n\nThe gameplay in ''Quake'' was considered unique for its time because of the different ways the player can maneuver through the game.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} For example: [[bunny hopping]] or [[strafe jumping]] can be used to move faster than normal, while [[rocket jumping]] enables the player to reach otherwise-inaccessible areas at the cost of some self-damage. The player can start and stop moving suddenly, jump unnaturally high, and change direction while moving through the air. Many of these non-realistic behaviors contribute to ''Quake''{{'}}s appeal. Multiplayer ''Quake'' was one of the first games singled out as a form of [[electronic sport]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the 2006 International Conference on Internet Computing and Conference on Computer Games Development, ICOMP '06 : Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, June 26-29, 2006|date=2006|publisher=CSREA Press|others=Arabnia, Hamid R., CGD '06 (2006.06.26-29 Las Vegas, Nev.), Conference on Computer Games Development (2006.06.26-29 Las Vegas, Nev.), ICOMP '06 (2006.06.26-29 Las Vegas, Nev.), International Conference on Internet Computing (2006.06.26-29 Las Vegas, Nev.)|isbn=1-60132-005-1|location=[Erscheinungsort nicht ermittelbar]|oclc=255355771}}</ref> A notable participant was [[Dennis Fong]] who won [[John Carmack]]'s [[Ferrari 328]] at the Microsoft-sponsored [[Red Annihilation]] tournament in 1997.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the single-player game, the player takes the role of the protagonist known as Ranger (voiced by [[Trent Reznor]])<ref>{{cite tweet |user=romero |last=Romero |first=John |number=571185625879048194 |date=February 26, 2015 |title=@branrags @Zyargeikunn : Trent Reznor did all the player sounds.}}</ref> who was sent into a portal in order to stop an enemy [[code-name]]d \"Quake\". The government had been experimenting with teleportation technology and developed a working prototype called a \"Slipgate\"; the mysterious Quake compromised the Slipgate by connecting it with its own teleportation system, using it to send death squads to the \"Human\" dimension in order to test the martial capabilities of humanity.\n\nThe sole surviving protagonist in \"Operation Counterstrike\" is Ranger, who must advance, starting each of the four episodes from an overrun human military base, before fighting his way into other dimensions, reaching them via the Slipgate or their otherworld equivalent. After passing through the Slipgate, Ranger's main objective is to collect four magic runes from four dimensions of Quake; these are the key to stopping the enemy later discovered as [[Shub-Niggurath]] and ending the invasion of Earth.\n\nThe single-player campaign consists of 30 separate levels, or \"maps\", divided into four episodes (with a total of 26 regular maps and four secret ones), as well as a hub level to select a difficulty setting and episode, and the game's final boss level. Each episode represents individual dimensions that the player can access through magical portals (as opposed to the technological Slipgate) that are discovered over the course of the game. The various realms consist of a number of [[Gothic architecture|gothic]], [[Middle Ages|medieval]], and lava-filled caves and dungeons, with a recurring theme of hellish and satanic imagery reminiscent of ''Doom'' (such as pentagrams and images of demons on the walls). The game's setting is inspired by several [[dark fantasy]] influences, most notably that of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. Dimensional Shamblers appear as enemies, the \"Spawn\" enemies are called \"Formless Spawn of [[Tsathoggua]]\" in the manual, the [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] of the first episode is named [[Chthonian (Cthulhu Mythos)|Chthon]], and the main villain is named Shub-Niggurath (though actually resembling a [[Dark Young]]). Some levels have Lovecraftian names, such as the Vaults of Zin and [[The Nameless City]]. In addition, six levels exclusively designed for multiplayer deathmatch are also included. Originally, the game was supposed to include more Lovecraftian bosses, but this concept was scrapped due to time constraints.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Quake - family tree.svg|thumb|Family graph of ''Quake'' engines]]\n[[File:Quake - family tree 2.svg|thumb|''Quake'' family graph, showing games and engines based on id Tech 2]]\n\nA preview included with [[id Software|id]]'s very first release, 1990's ''[[Commander Keen]]'', advertised a game entitled ''The Fight for Justice'' as a follow-up to the ''Commander Keen'' trilogy.

Conceived as a [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] full-color [[Side-scrolling game|side-scrolling]] [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]], ''The Fight for Justice'' was never released.\n\nLead designer and director [[John Romero]] later conceived of ''Quake'' as an [[action game]] taking place in a fully [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world, inspired by [[Sega AM2]]'s 3D [[fighting game]] ''[[Virtua Fighter]]''. ''Quake'' was also intended to feature ''Virtua Fighter'' influenced third-person [[Beat 'em up|melee combat]]. However, id Software considered it to be risky. Because the project was taking too long, the third-person melee was eventually dropped. This led to creative differences between Romero and id Software, and eventually his departure from the company after ''Quake'' was released.<ref name=\"nextgen\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=30|date=June 1997|pages=9\u201312|title=Does John Romero Still Enjoy Shooting People? |url=https://archive.org/stream/NextGeneration30Jun1997/Next_Generation_30_Jun_1997#page/n9/mode/2up}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Edge|issue=45 |date=May 1997|quote=My original idea was to do something like ''Virtua Fighter'' in a 3D world, with full-contact fighting, but you'd also be able to run through a world, and do the same stuff you do in ''Quake'', only when you got into these melees, the camera would pull out into a third-person perspective.

It was described as a technology demo and was limited to three multiplayer maps. There was no single-player support and some of the gameplay and graphics were unfinished or different from their final versions. ''QTest'' gave gamers their first peek into the filesystem and modifiability of the ''Quake'' engine, and many entity mods (that placed monsters in the otherwise empty multiplayer maps) and custom player skins began appearing online before the full game was even released.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/blast-from-the-past-iii-quaking-in-fear|title=Blast from the Past III: Quaking in Fear|author=Pete Davison|publisher=[[USgamer]]|date=August 2, 2013|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the game was designed so that when the player ran out of ammunition, the player character would hit enemies with a [[gun-butt]].<ref name=\"Max6\"/> Shortly before release this was replaced with an [[axe]].\n\n=== Music and sound design ===\n{{Main|Quake (original soundtrack)}}\n''Quake''{{'}}s music and sound design was done by [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]], using ambient soundscapes and synthesized [[drone (music)|drone]]s to create atmospheric tracks.

The first mods were small gameplay fixes and patches initiated by the community, usually enhancements to weapons or gameplay with new enemies. Later mods were more ambitious and resulted in ''Quake'' fans creating versions of the game that were drastically different from id Software's original release.\n\nThe first major ''Quake'' mod was ''[[Team Fortress]]''. This mod consists of Capture the Flag gameplay with a class system for the players. Players choose a class, which creates various restrictions on weapons and armor types available to that player, and also grants special abilities. For example, the bread-and-butter ''Soldier'' class has medium armor, medium speed, and a well-rounded selection of weapons and grenades, while the ''Scout'' class is lightly armored, very fast, has a scanner that detects nearby enemies, but has very weak offensive weapons. One of the other differences with CTF is the fact that the flag is not returned automatically when a player drops it: running over one's flag in ''Threewave CTF'' would return the flag to the base, and in ''TF'' the flag remains in the same spot for preconfigured time and it has to be defended on remote locations. This caused a shift in defensive tactics compared to ''Threewave CTF''. ''Team Fortress'' maintained its standing as the most-played online ''Quake'' modification for many years.\n\nAnother popular mod was ''[[Threewave Software|Threewave]] [[Capture the Flag]]'' (CTF), primarily authored by Dave 'Zoid' Kirsch. ''Threewave CTF'' is a [[partial conversion]] consisting of new levels, a new weapon (a [[grappling hook]]), power-ups, new [[texture mapping|textures]], and new gameplay rules. Typically, two teams (red and blue) would compete in a game of [[Capture the flag]], though a few maps with up to four teams (red, blue, green, and yellow) were created. Capture the Flag soon became a standard game mode included in most popular multiplayer games released after ''Quake''. ''[[Rocket Arena]]'' provides the ability for players to face each other in small, open arenas with changes in the gameplay rules so that item collection and detailed level knowledge are no longer factors. A series of short rounds, with the surviving player in each round gaining a point, instead tests the player's aiming and dodging skills and reflexes.

(Atari, SA subsidiary)|GT Interactive]]. These shareware copies could be converted into complete versions through passwords purchased via phone. However, Kushner wrote that \"gamers wasted no time hacking the shareware to unlock the full version of the game for free.\" This problem, combined with the scale of the operation, led id Software to cancel the plan. As a result, the company was left with 150,000 unsold shareware copies in storage. The venture damaged ''Quake''{{'}}s initial sales and caused its retail push by GT Interactive to miss the holiday shopping season.

The footage was edited into a continuous 19 minutes, 49 seconds demo called ''Quake done Quick'' and released on June 10, 1997. Owners of ''Quake'' could replay this demo in the game engine, watching the run unfold as if they were playing it themselves.\n\nThis involved a number of players recording run-throughs of individual levels, using every trick and shortcut they could discover in order to minimize the time it took to complete, usually to a degree that even the original level designers found difficult to comprehend, and in a manner that often bypassed large areas of the level. Stitching a series of the fastest runs together into a coherent whole created a demonstration of the entire game. ''Recamming'' is also used with speedruns in order to make the experience more movie-like, with arbitrary control of camera angles, editing, and sound that can be applied with editing software after the runs are first recorded. However, the fastest possible time for a given level will not necessarily result in the fastest time used to contribute to \"running\" the entire game. One example is acquiring the grenade launcher in an early level, an act that slows down the time for that level over the best possible, but speeds up the overall game time by allowing the runner to bypass a big area in a later level that they could not otherwise do.\n\nA second attempt, ''Quake done Quicker'', reduced the completion time to 16 minutes, 35 seconds (a reduction of 3 minutes, 14 seconds). ''Quake done Quicker'' was released on September 13, 1997. One of the levels included was the result of an online competition to see who could get the fastest time. The culmination of this process of improvement was ''Quake done Quick with a Vengeance''. Released three years to the day after ''Quake done Quicker'', this pared down the time taken to complete all four episodes, on Nightmare (hardest) difficulty, to 12 minutes, 23 seconds (a further reduction of 4 minutes, 12 seconds), partly by using techniques that had formerly been shunned in such films as being less aesthetically pleasing. This run was recorded as an in-game demo, but interest was such that an [[Audio Video Interleave|.avi]] video clip was created to allow those without the game to see the run.\n\nMost full-game speedruns are a collaborative effort by a number of runners (though some have been done by single runners on their own). Although each particular level is credited to one runner, the ideas and techniques used are iterative and collaborative in nature, with each runner picking up tips and ideas from the others, so that speeds keep improving beyond what was thought possible as the runs are further optimized and new tricks or routes are discovered. Further time improvements of the continuous whole game run were achieved into the 21st century. In addition, many thousands of individual level runs are kept at [[Speed Demos Archive]]'s ''Quake'' section, including many on custom maps. Speedrunning is a counterpart to multiplayer modes in making ''Quake'' one of the first games promoted as a virtual sport.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe [[source code]] of the ''Quake'' and ''[[QuakeWorld]]'' engines was licensed under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] on December 21, 1999. The id Software maps, objects, textures, sounds, and other creative works remain under their original proprietary license. The [[shareware]] distribution of ''Quake'' is still freely redistributable and usable with the GPLed engine code. One must purchase a copy of ''Quake'' in order to receive the registered version of the game which includes more single-player episodes and the [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] maps. Based on the success of the first ''Quake'' game, and later published ''[[Quake II]]'' and ''[[Quake III Arena]]''; ''[[Quake 4]]'' was released in October 2005, developed by [[Raven Software]] using the ''[[Doom 3]]'' engine.\n\n''Quake'' was the game primarily responsible for the emergence of the [[machinima]] artform of films made in game engines, thanks to edited ''Quake'' demos such as ''[[Ranger Gone Bad]]'' and ''[[Blahbalicious]]'', the in-game film ''The Devil's Covenant'', and the in-game-rendered, four-hour epic film ''[[The Seal of Nehahra]]''. On June 22, 2006, it had been 10 years since the original uploading of the game to [[cdrom.com]] archives.

Unlike the main ''Quake'' game and Mission Pack No. 2, ''Scourge'' does away with the episode hub, requiring the three episodes to be played sequentially. The three new enemies include Centroids, large cybernetic scorpions with nailguns; Gremlins, small goblins that can steal weapons and multiply by feeding on enemy corpses; and Spike Mines, floating orbs that detonate when near the player. The three new weapons include the Mjolnir, a large lightning emitting hammer; the Laser Cannon, which shoots bouncing bolts of energy; and the Proximity Mine Launcher, which fires grenades that attach to surfaces and detonate when an opponent comes near. The three new power-ups include the Horn of Conjuring, which summons an enemy to protect the player; the Empathy Shield, which halves the damage taken by the player between the player and the attacking enemy; and the Wetsuit, which renders the player invulnerable to electricity and allows the player to stay underwater for a period of time. The storyline follows Armagon, a general of Quake's forces, planning to invade [[Earth]] via a portal known as the 'Rift'. Armagon resembles a giant gremlin with cybernetic legs and a combined [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launcher]]/[[laser cannon]] for arms.\n\nTim Soete of ''[[GameSpot]]'' gave it a score 8.6 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web |last=Soete |first=Tim |title=Quake Mission Pack: Scourge of Armagon Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/quake-mission-pack-scourge-of-armagon-review/1900-2532927/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=December 1, 2018 |date=November 9, 2000}}</ref>\n\n===''Quake Mission Pack No. 2: Dissolution of Eternity''===\n''Quake Mission Pack No. 2: Dissolution of Eternity'' was the second official mission pack, released on March 19, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamecenter.com/News/Item/0,3,0-674,00.html|title=Game pieces--Blood patch is out!|last=Smith|first=Erica|date=March 19, 1997|website=[[CNET#Gamecenter|CNET Gamecenter]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817195734/http://www.gamecenter.com/News/Item/0,3,0-674,00.html|archive-date=August 17, 2000|url-status=dead|access-date=December 5, 2019}}<br>'''Quake Mission Pack 2''': \"With a quick one-two punch, Activision is already announcing the release of the second Quake Mission Pack.\"</ref> Developed by [[Rogue Entertainment]], it features two episodes divided into fifteen new single-player levels, a new multiplayer level, a new soundtrack, and several new enemies and bosses.

It boasted full 16-bit color, bilinear filtering (reducing pixelation), improved dynamic lighting, optional anti-aliasing, and improved source code clarity, as the improved performance finally allowed the use of gotos to be abandoned in favor of proper loop constructs. As the name implied, ''VQuake'' was a proprietary port specifically for the V\u00e9rit\u00e9; consumer 3D acceleration was in its infancy at the time, and there was no standard 3D API for the consumer market. After completing ''VQuake'', John Carmack vowed to never write a proprietary port again, citing his frustration with Rendition's [[Redline (API)|Speedy3D]] API.\n\n===''QuakeWorld''===\n{{Main|QuakeWorld}}\nTo improve the quality of online play, id Software released ''[[QuakeWorld]]'' on December 17, 1996, a build of ''Quake'' that featured significantly revamped network code including the addition of [[client-side prediction]]. The original ''Quake''{{'s}} network code would not show the player the results of his actions until the server sent back a reply acknowledging them. For example, if the player attempted to move forward, his client would send the request to move forward to the server, and the server would determine whether the client was actually able to move forward or if he ran into an obstacle, such as a wall or another player. The server would then respond to the client, and only then would the client display movement to the player. This was fine for play on a LAN, a high bandwidth, very low latency connection, but the latency over a dial-up Internet connection is much larger than on a LAN, and this caused a noticeable delay between when a player tried to act and when that action was visible on the screen. This made gameplay much more difficult, especially since the unpredictable nature of the Internet made the amount of delay vary from moment to moment. Players would experience jerky, laggy motion that sometimes felt like ice skating, where they would slide around with seemingly no ability to stop, due to a build-up of previously-sent movement requests. John Carmack has admitted that this was a serious problem which should have been fixed before release, but it was not caught because he and other developers had high-speed Internet access at home.\n\nWith the help of [[client-side prediction]], which allowed players to see their own movement immediately without waiting for a response from the server, ''QuakeWorld''{{'s}} network code allowed players with high-latency connections to control their character's movement almost as precisely as when playing in single-player mode. The [[Netcode]] parameters could be adjusted by the user so that ''QuakeWorld'' performed well for users with high and low latency.\n\nThe trade off to client-side prediction was that sometimes other players or objects would no longer be quite where they had appeared to be, or, in extreme cases, that the player would be pulled back to a previous position when the client received a late reply from the server which overrode movement the client had already previewed; this was known as \"warping\". As a result, some serious players, particularly in the U.S., still preferred to play online using the original ''Quake'' engine (commonly called ''NetQuake'') rather than ''QuakeWorld''. However, the majority of players, especially those on dial-up connections, preferred the newer network model, and ''QuakeWorld'' soon became the dominant form of online play. Following the success of ''QuakeWorld'', client-side prediction has become a standard feature of nearly all real-time online games. As with all other ''Quake'' upgrades, ''QuakeWorld'' was released as a free, unsupported add-on to the game and was updated numerous times through 1998.\n\n===''GLQuake''===\nOn January 22, 1997, id Software released ''GLQuake''. This was designed to use the [[OpenGL]] 3D [[Application programming interface|API]] to access hardware 3D graphics acceleration cards to [[rasterization|rasterize]] the graphics, rather than having the computer's [[CPU]] fill in every [[pixel]]. In addition to higher framerates for most players, ''GLQuake'' provided higher [[display resolution|resolution]] modes and [[texture filtering]]. ''GLQuake'' also experimented with reflections, transparent water, and even rudimentary shadows. ''GLQuake'' came with a [[MiniGL|driver]] enabling the subset of OpenGL used by the game to function on the [[3dfx]] ''[[Voodoo Graphics]]'' card, the only consumer-level card at the time capable of running ''GLQuake'' well. Previously, John Carmack had experimented with a version of Quake specifically written for the [[Rendition V\u00e9rit\u00e9]] chip used in the [[Creative Labs]] ''PCI 3D Blaster'' card. This version had met with only limited success, and Carmack decided to write for generic APIs in the future rather than tailoring for specific hardware.\n\n===''WinQuake''===\nOn March 11, 1997, id Software released ''WinQuake'', a version of the non-OpenGL engine designed to run under [[Microsoft Windows]]; the original ''Quake'' had been written for [[DOS]], allowing for launch from [[Windows 95]], but could not run under [[Windows NT]]-based operating systems because it required direct access to hardware. ''WinQuake'' instead accessed hardware via [[Win32]]-based APIs such as [[DirectSound]], [[DirectInput]], and [[DirectDraw]] that were supported on Windows 95, [[Windows NT 4.0]] and later releases. Like ''GLQuake'', ''WinQuake'' also allowed higher resolution video modes. This removed the last barrier to widespread popularity of the game. In 1998, LBE Systems and Laser-Tron released ''Quake: Arcade Tournament Edition'' in the arcades in limited quantities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9188 |title=''Quake'' \u2013 Arcade Tournament Edition |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===''Dimension of the Past''===\nTo celebrate ''Quake''{{'}}s 20th anniversary, a mission pack was developed by [[MachineGames]] and released on June 24, 2016.

''[[Quake 4]]'' followed the design themes of ''Quake II'', whereas ''Quake III Arena'' mixed these styles; it had a parallel setting that housed several \"id all-stars\" from various games as playable characters.

Membership of Universities Canada, and the university's provincial government charter, are seen as serving in lieu of institutional accreditation, both in Canada and abroad. Eight Canadian provinces have established bodies to provide a second level of quality assurance at universities. [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] do not have provincial quality assurance agencies.\n\nIn addition, graduate programs and professional schools such as [[List of law schools in Canada|law]], [[Nurses#Canada|nursing]], [[Medical school#United States .26 Canada|medicine]] and [[engineer]]ing obtain accreditation from accreditation boards, operated by various professional regulatory bodies.\n\nIn Canada, universities are distinct from [[College (Canada)|colleges]]. [[Universities Canada]], an organisation composed of Canadian universities, defines universities as [[university degree|degree]]-granting institutions, i.e. institutions which provide [[bachelor's degree]]s, [[master's degree]]s, and [[doctoral degree]]s.

Tuition is based on program material and content which varies in price. For many programs, more general courses will be taken in first year while \"program specific courses\" begin in year two.

Membership of Universities Canada, and the university's provincial government charter, are seen as serving in lieu of institutional accreditation, both in Canada and abroad. Eight Canadian provinces have established bodies to provide a second level of quality assurance at universities. [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] do not have provincial quality assurance agencies.\n\nIn addition, graduate programs and professional schools such as [[List of law schools in Canada|law]], [[Nurses#Canada|nursing]], [[Medical school#United States .26 Canada|medicine]] and [[engineer]]ing obtain accreditation from accreditation boards, operated by various professional regulatory bodies.\n\nIn Canada, universities are distinct from [[College (Canada)|colleges]]. [[Universities Canada]], an organisation composed of Canadian universities, defines universities as [[university degree|degree]]-granting institutions, i.e. institutions which provide [[bachelor's degree]]s, [[master's degree]]s, and [[doctoral degree]]s. The organization defines colleges, similar to [[community college#United States|community colleges]] in the United States, as institutions that grant diplomas.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-10-23|url=http://www.aucc.ca/can_uni/general_info/schools_e.html|title=Post-secondary institutions defined|publisher=Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada|archivedate=2008-12-19|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219010101/http://www.aucc.ca/can_uni/general_info/schools_e.html}}</ref>\n\nSome colleges are enabled by provincial legislation to provide a limited set of bachelor's degree programs or provide bachelor's degrees through joint programs with universities. In Ontario, for example, this ability is highly restricted and must be renewed yearly.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2017-06-29|url=https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00p36?search=degree#BK6|title=Post-secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, 2000, S.O. 2000, c. 36, Sched.|publisher=Queen's Printer in Right of Ontario|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506014910/https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00p36?search=degree#BK6|archivedate=2018-05-06}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2016}} there are 96 universities in Canada, offering education in [[Official bilingualism in Canada|English and French]].

Tuition is based on program material and content which varies in price. For many programs, more general courses will be taken in first year while \"program specific courses\" begin in year two. Some universities such as [[University of Toronto]] require admission separate from initial admission from high school into specific programs based on internal standards achieved in first year (i.e. a set grade point average).{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Universities by province ==\n[[File:Corbett Hall University Of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 08A.jpg|thumb|The University of Alberta has the largest number of graduate students enrolled in Alberta.]]\n\n=== Alberta ===\n{{see also|Higher education in Alberta|List of colleges in Alberta}}\nPost-secondary education in Alberta is regulated by the [[Alberta Advanced Education and Technology|Ministry of Advanced Education]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> There are eight public universities in [[Alberta]], eleven public colleges, two polytechnical institutes (which grant degrees), and seven private colleges (all of which grant degrees).

The hypersonic regime can also be alternatively defined as speeds where specific heat capacity changes with the temperature of the flow as kinetic energy of the moving object is converted into heat.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/BGH/realspec.html\n|title=Specific Heat Capacity, Calorically Imperfect Gas\n|publisher=[[NASA]]\n|access-date=2019-12-27\n}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics of flow==\nWhile the definition of hypersonic flow can be quite vague and is generally debatable (especially due to the absence of discontinuity between supersonic and hypersonic flows), a hypersonic flow may be characterized by certain physical phenomena that can no longer be analytically discounted as in supersonic flow. The peculiarity in hypersonic flows are as follows:\n# Shock layer\n# [[Aerodynamic heating]]\n# Entropy layer\n# Real gas effects\n# Low density effects\n# Independence of aerodynamic coefficients with Mach number.\n\n===Small shock stand-off distance===\nAs a body's Mach number increases, the density behind a [[Shock wave#Bow shocks|bow shock]] generated by the body also increases, which corresponds to a decrease in volume behind the shock due to [[conservation of mass]]. Consequently, the distance between the bow shock and the body decreases at higher Mach numbers.\n\n===Entropy layer===\nAs Mach numbers increase, the [[entropy]] change across the shock also increases, which results in a strong [[entropy gradient]] and highly [[vortical]] flow that mixes with the [[boundary layer]].\n\n===Viscous interaction===\nA portion of the large [[kinetic energy]] associated with flow at high Mach numbers transforms into [[internal energy]] in the fluid due to viscous effects. The increase in internal energy is realized as an increase in temperature. Since the pressure gradient normal to the flow within a boundary layer is approximately zero for low to moderate hypersonic Mach numbers, the increase of temperature through the boundary layer coincides with a decrease in density. This causes the bottom of the boundary layer to expand, so that the boundary layer over the body grows thicker and can often merge with the shock wave near the body leading edge.\n\n===High-temperature flow===\nHigh temperatures due to a manifestation of viscous dissipation cause non-equilibrium chemical flow properties such as vibrational excitation and [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[ionization]] of molecules resulting in [[convection|convective]] and [[Atmospheric reentry#Real (non-equilibrium) gas model|radiative heat-flux]].\n\n== Classification of Mach regimes ==\nAlthough \"subsonic\" and \"supersonic\" usually refer to speeds below and above the local [[speed of sound]] respectively, aerodynamicists often use these terms to refer to particular ranges of Mach values. This occurs because a \"[[transonic]] regime\" exists around M=1 where approximations of the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] used for subsonic design no longer apply, partly because the flow locally exceeds M=1 even when the freestream{{clarify|date=March 2018}} Mach number is below this value.\n\nThe \"supersonic regime\" usually refers to the set of Mach numbers for which linearised theory may be used; for example, where the ([[air]]) flow is not chemically reacting and where [[heat transfer]] between air and vehicle may be reasonably neglected in calculations. Generally, [[NASA]] defines \"high\" hypersonic as any Mach number from 10 to 25, and re-entry speeds as anything greater than Mach 25. Among the aircraft operating in this regime are the [[Space Shuttle]] and (theoretically) various developing [[spaceplane]]s.\n\nIn the following table, the \"regimes\" or \"ranges of Mach values\" are referenced instead of the usual meanings of \"subsonic\" and \"supersonic\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Regime\n! colspan=\"4\" | Velocity\n! rowspan=\"2\" | General plane characteristics\n|-\n!

Sharp edges, thin [[airfoil]]-sections, and all-moving [[tailplane]]/[[canard (aeronautics)|canards]] are common. Modern [[combat aircraft]] must compromise in order to maintain low-speed handling; \"true\" supersonic designs include the [[F-104 Starfighter]] and BAC/A\u00e9rospatiale [[Concorde]].\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF7070;\" | Hypersonic\n| 5\u201310\n| 3836\u20137673\n| 6174\u201312350\n| 1715\u20133430\n| Cooled [[nickel]] or [[titanium]] skin; the design is highly integrated, instead of assembled from separate independently-designed components, due to the domination of interference effects, where small changes in any one component will cause large changes in air flow around all other components, which in turn affects their behavior. The result is that no one component can be designed without knowing how all other components will affect all of the air flows around the craft, and any changes to any one component may require a redesign of all other components simultaneously; small wings. See [[Boeing X-51|X-51A Waverider]], [[HyperSoar]] and [[WU-14]] (DF-ZF).\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FF0000;\" | High-hypersonic\n| 10\u201325\n| 7673\u201319180\n| 12350\u201330870\n| 3430\u20138575\n| Thermal control becomes a dominant design consideration. Structure must either be designed to operate hot, or be protected by special [[silicate]] tiles or similar. Chemically reacting flow can also cause corrosion of the vehicle's skin, with free-atomic [[oxygen]] featuring in very high-speed flows. Examples include the 53T6 ABM-3 Gazelle (Mach 17) anti-ballistic missile, the [[Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 | HTV-2]]  glide vehicle (Mach 20), the [[DF-41]] (Mach 25) [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] and the [[Avangard (hypersonic glide vehicle)|Avangard]] hypersonic vehicle (Mach 27). Hypersonic designs are often forced into [[Atmospheric entry#Blunt body entry vehicles|blunt configurations]] because of the [[aerodynamic heating]] rising with a reduced [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]].\n|-\n! style=\"background:#A00000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Re-entry <br/>speeds\n| >&#8239;25\n| >&#8239;19180\n| >&#8239;30870\n| >&#8239;8575\n| Ablative heat shield; small or no wings; blunt shape.\n|}\n\n==Similarity parameters==\nThe categorization of airflow relies on a number of [[Dimensionless numbers|similarity parameters]], which allow the simplification of a nearly infinite number of test cases into groups of similarity. For transonic and [[compressible flow]], the [[Mach number|Mach]] and [[Reynolds number]]s alone allow good categorization of many flow cases.\n\nHypersonic flows, however, require other similarity parameters. First, the [[analytic equation]]s for the [[shock wave|oblique shock angle]] become nearly independent of Mach number at high (~>10) Mach numbers. Second, the formation of strong shocks around aerodynamic bodies means that the freestream [[Reynolds number]] is less useful as an estimate of the behavior of the [[boundary layer]] over a body (although it is still important). Finally, the increased temperature of hypersonic flows mean that [[real gas]] effects become important. For this reason, research in hypersonics is often referred to as [[aerothermodynamics]], rather than [[aerodynamics]].\n\nThe introduction of real gas effects means that more variables are required to describe the full state of a gas. Whereas a stationary gas can be described by three variables ([[pressure]], [[temperature]], [[adiabatic index]]), and a moving gas by four ([[flow velocity]]), a hot gas in chemical equilibrium also requires state equations for the chemical components of the gas, and a gas in nonequilibrium solves those state equations using time as an extra variable. This means that for a nonequilibrium flow, something between 10 and 100 variables may be required to describe the state of the gas at any given time. Additionally, rarefied hypersonic flows (usually defined as those with a [[Knudsen number]] above 0.1) do not follow the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]].\n\nHypersonic flows are typically categorized by their total energy, expressed as total [[enthalpy]] (MJ/kg), total pressure (kPa-MPa), stagnation pressure (kPa-MPa), [[stagnation temperature]] (K), or flow velocity (km/s).\n\n[[Wallace D. Hayes]] developed a similarity parameter, similar to the [[area rule|Whitcomb area rule]], which allowed similar configurations to be compared.\n\n==Regimes==\nHypersonic flow can be approximately separated into a number of regimes. The selection of these regimes is rough, due to the blurring of the boundaries where a particular effect can be found.\n\n===Perfect gas===\nIn this regime, the gas can be regarded as an [[ideal gas]]. Flow in this regime is still Mach number dependent. Simulations start to depend on the use of a constant-temperature wall, rather than the adiabatic wall typically used at lower speeds. The lower border of this region is around Mach 5, where [[ramjet]]s become inefficient, and the upper border around Mach 10-12.\n\n===Two-temperature ideal gas===\nThis is a subset of the perfect gas regime, where the gas can be considered chemically perfect, but the rotational and vibrational temperatures of the gas must be considered separately, leading to two temperature models. See particularly the modeling of supersonic nozzles, where vibrational freezing becomes important.\n\n===Dissociated gas===\nIn this regime, diatomic or polyatomic gases (the gases found in most atmospheres) begin to [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] as they come into contact with the [[Shock wave|bow shock]] generated by the body. [[catalysis|Surface catalysis]] plays a role in the calculation of surface heating, meaning that the type of surface material also has an effect on the flow. The lower border of this regime is where any component of a gas mixture first begins to dissociate in the stagnation point of a flow (which for nitrogen is around 2000 K). At the upper border of this regime, the effects of [[ionization]] start to have an effect on the flow.\n\n===Ionized gas===\nIn this regime the [[ionization|ionized]] electron population of the stagnated flow becomes significant, and the electrons must be modeled separately. Often the electron temperature is handled separately from the temperature of the remaining gas components. This region occurs for freestream flow velocities around 10\u201312&nbsp;km/s. Gases in this region are modeled as non-radiating [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]].\n\n===Radiation-dominated regime===\nAbove around 12&nbsp;km/s, the heat transfer to a vehicle changes from being conductively dominated to radiatively dominated. The modeling of gases in this regime is split into two classes:\n#[[Optical depth|Optically thin]]: where the gas does not re-absorb radiation emitted from other parts of the gas\n#Optically thick: where the radiation must be considered a separate source of energy.\nThe modeling of optically thin gases is extremely difficult, since, due to the calculation of the radiation at each point, the computation load theoretically expands exponentially as the number of points considered increases.\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Supersonic transport]]\n*[[Lifting body]]\n*[[Atmospheric entry]]\n*[[Hypersonic flight]]\n*[[DARPA Falcon Project]]\n*[[Reaction Engines Skylon]] (design study)\n*[[Reaction Engines A2]] (design study)\n*[[HyperSoar]] (concept)\n*[[WaveRider|X-51 A Waverider]]\n*[[X-20 Dyna-Soar]] (cancelled)\n*[[Rockwell X-30]] (cancelled)\n*[[Avatar (spacecraft)|Avatar RLV]] (2001 Indian concept study)\n*[[Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle]] (Indian project)\n*[[Ayaks]] (Russian wave rider project from the 1990s)\n*[[Avangard (hypersonic glide vehicle)|Avangard]] (Russian hypersonic glide vehicle, in service)\n*[[DF-ZF]] (Chinese hypersonic Glide Vehicle, Operational)\n*[[Lockheed Martin SR-72]] (Planned)\n{{colend}}\n\n;Engines\n*[[Rocket engine]]\n*[[Ramjet]]\n*[[Scramjet]]\n*[[Reaction Engines SABRE]], [[LAPCAT]] (design studies)\n\n;Missiles\n*[[Shaurya (missile)]] Ballistic Missile - {{flagicon|India}} [[India]] (Entered Production)\n*[[BrahMos-II]] Cruise Missile - {{flagicon|India}} {{flagicon|Russia}} (Under Development)\n*[[9K720 Iskander]] Short-range ballistic missile {{flagicon|Russia}} [[Russia]] (Currently In Service)\n*[[3M22 Zircon]] Anti-ship hypersonic cruise missile {{flagicon|Russia}} (in production)\n*[[R-37 (missile)]] Hypersonic air-to-air missile {{flagicon|Russia}} (in service)\n*[[Kh-47M2 Kinzhal]] Hypersonic air-launched ballistic missile {{flagicon|Russia}} (in service)\n\n;Other flow regimes\n* [[Subsonic flight]]\n* [[Transonic]]\n* [[Supersonic speed]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Anderson|first=John|year=2006|title=Hypersonic and High-Temperature Gas Dynamics |edition=Second |publisher=AIAA Education Series|isbn=1-56347-780-7}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Hypersonics}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160412050110/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/BGH/index.html NASA's Guide to Hypersonics]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121011210111/http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/hypersonics Hypersonics Group at Imperial College]\n*[http://www.mech.uq.edu.au/hyper/ University of Queensland Centre for Hypersonics]\n*[http://seit.unsw.adfa.edu.au/research/activity.php?activity_id=42 High Speed Flow Group at University of New South Wales]\n*[http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/thermofluids/research/hypersonics-research-group Hypersonics Group at the University of Oxford]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hypersonic Speed}}\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Aerospace engineering]]\n[[Category:Airspeed]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft propulsion]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses2|Hypersonic}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{one source|date=October 2014}}\n{{more footnotes|date=January 2013}}\n}}\n\n[[File:X-43A (Hyper - X) Mach 7 computational fluid dynamic (CFD).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] image of the [[NASA X-43|NASA X-43A]] at Mach 7]]\n[[File:Dopplereffectsourcemovingrightatmach5.0.gif|thumb|Simulation of hypersonic speed (Mach 5)]]\nIn [[aerodynamics]], a '''hypersonic speed''' is one that greatly exceeds the [[speed of sound]], often stated as starting at speeds of [[speed of sound|Mach]] 5 and above.<ref>{{cite book | title=Atmospheric Flight in the Twentieth Century | editor=Galison, P. |editor2=Roland, A. | publisher=Springer | year=2000 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfrOBgAAQBAJ | isbn=978-94-011-4379-0 | page=90}}</ref>\n\nThe precise [[Mach number]] at which a craft can be said to be flying at hypersonic speed varies, since individual physical changes in the airflow (like molecular [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[ionization]]) occur at different speeds; these effects collectively become important around Mach 5-10. The hypersonic regime can also be alternatively defined as speeds where specific heat capacity changes with the temperature of the flow as kinetic energy of the moving object is converted into heat.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/BGH/realspec.html\n|title=Specific Heat Capacity, Calorically Imperfect Gas\n|publisher=[[NASA]]\n|access-date=2019-12-27\n}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics of flow==\nWhile the definition of hypersonic flow can be quite vague and is generally debatable (especially due to the absence of discontinuity between supersonic and hypersonic flows), a hypersonic flow may be characterized by certain physical phenomena that can no longer be analytically discounted as in supersonic flow. The peculiarity in hypersonic flows are as follows:\n# Shock layer\n# [[Aerodynamic heating]]\n# Entropy layer\n# Real gas effects\n# Low density effects\n# Independence of aerodynamic coefficients with Mach number.\n\n===Small shock stand-off distance===\nAs a body's Mach number increases, the density behind a [[Shock wave#Bow shocks|bow shock]] generated by the body also increases, which corresponds to a decrease in volume behind the shock due to [[conservation of mass]]. Consequently, the distance between the bow shock and the body decreases at higher Mach numbers.\n\n===Entropy layer===\nAs Mach numbers increase, the [[entropy]] change across the shock also increases, which results in a strong [[entropy gradient]] and highly [[vortical]] flow that mixes with the [[boundary layer]].\n\n===Viscous interaction===\nA portion of the large [[kinetic energy]] associated with flow at high Mach numbers transforms into [[internal energy]] in the fluid due to viscous effects. The increase in internal energy is realized as an increase in temperature. Since the pressure gradient normal to the flow within a boundary layer is approximately zero for low to moderate hypersonic Mach numbers, the increase of temperature through the boundary layer coincides with a decrease in density. This causes the bottom of the boundary layer to expand, so that the boundary layer over the body grows thicker and can often merge with the shock wave near the body leading edge.\n\n===High-temperature flow===\nHigh temperatures due to a manifestation of viscous dissipation cause non-equilibrium chemical flow properties such as vibrational excitation and [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[ionization]] of molecules resulting in [[convection|convective]] and [[Atmospheric reentry#Real (non-equilibrium) gas model|radiative heat-flux]].\n\n== Classification of Mach regimes ==\nAlthough \"subsonic\" and \"supersonic\" usually refer to speeds below and above the local [[speed of sound]] respectively, aerodynamicists often use these terms to refer to particular ranges of Mach values. This occurs because a \"[[transonic]] regime\" exists around M=1 where approximations of the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] used for subsonic design no longer apply, partly because the flow locally exceeds M=1 even when the freestream{{clarify|date=March 2018}} Mach number is below this value.\n\nThe \"supersonic regime\" usually refers to the set of Mach numbers for which linearised theory may be used; for example, where the ([[air]]) flow is not chemically reacting and where [[heat transfer]] between air and vehicle may be reasonably neglected in calculations. Generally, [[NASA]] defines \"high\" hypersonic as any Mach number from 10 to 25, and re-entry speeds as anything greater than Mach 25. Among the aircraft operating in this regime are the [[Space Shuttle]] and (theoretically) various developing [[spaceplane]]s.\n\nIn the following table, the \"regimes\" or \"ranges of Mach values\" are referenced instead of the usual meanings of \"subsonic\" and \"supersonic\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Regime\n! colspan=\"4\" | Velocity\n! rowspan=\"2\" | General plane characteristics\n|-\n!

Sharp edges, thin [[airfoil]]-sections, and all-moving [[tailplane]]/[[canard (aeronautics)|canards]] are common. Modern [[combat aircraft]] must compromise in order to maintain low-speed handling; \"true\" supersonic designs include the [[F-104 Starfighter]] and BAC/A\u00e9rospatiale [[Concorde]].\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF7070;\" | Hypersonic\n| 5\u201310\n| 3836\u20137673\n| 6174\u201312350\n| 1715\u20133430\n| Cooled [[nickel]] or [[titanium]] skin; the design is highly integrated, instead of assembled from separate independently-designed components, due to the domination of interference effects, where small changes in any one component will cause large changes in air flow around all other components, which in turn affects their behavior. The result is that no one component can be designed without knowing how all other components will affect all of the air flows around the craft, and any changes to any one component may require a redesign of all other components simultaneously; small wings.

Structure must either be designed to operate hot, or be protected by special [[silicate]] tiles or similar. Chemically reacting flow can also cause corrosion of the vehicle's skin, with free-atomic [[oxygen]] featuring in very high-speed flows. Examples include the 53T6 ABM-3 Gazelle (Mach 17) anti-ballistic missile, the [[Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 | HTV-2]]  glide vehicle (Mach 20), the [[DF-41]] (Mach 25) [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] and the [[Avangard (hypersonic glide vehicle)|Avangard]] hypersonic vehicle (Mach 27). Hypersonic designs are often forced into [[Atmospheric entry#Blunt body entry vehicles|blunt configurations]] because of the [[aerodynamic heating]] rising with a reduced [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]].\n|-\n! style=\"background:#A00000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Re-entry <br/>speeds\n| >&#8239;25\n| >&#8239;19180\n| >&#8239;30870\n| >&#8239;8575\n| Ablative heat shield; small or no wings; blunt shape.\n|}\n\n==Similarity parameters==\nThe categorization of airflow relies on a number of [[Dimensionless numbers|similarity parameters]], which allow the simplification of a nearly infinite number of test cases into groups of similarity. For transonic and [[compressible flow]], the [[Mach number|Mach]] and [[Reynolds number]]s alone allow good categorization of many flow cases.\n\nHypersonic flows, however, require other similarity parameters. First, the [[analytic equation]]s for the [[shock wave|oblique shock angle]] become nearly independent of Mach number at high (~>10) Mach numbers. Second, the formation of strong shocks around aerodynamic bodies means that the freestream [[Reynolds number]] is less useful as an estimate of the behavior of the [[boundary layer]] over a body (although it is still important). Finally, the increased temperature of hypersonic flows mean that [[real gas]] effects become important. For this reason, research in hypersonics is often referred to as [[aerothermodynamics]], rather than [[aerodynamics]].\n\nThe introduction of real gas effects means that more variables are required to describe the full state of a gas. Whereas a stationary gas can be described by three variables ([[pressure]], [[temperature]], [[adiabatic index]]), and a moving gas by four ([[flow velocity]]), a hot gas in chemical equilibrium also requires state equations for the chemical components of the gas, and a gas in nonequilibrium solves those state equations using time as an extra variable. This means that for a nonequilibrium flow, something between 10 and 100 variables may be required to describe the state of the gas at any given time. Additionally, rarefied hypersonic flows (usually defined as those with a [[Knudsen number]] above 0.1) do not follow the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]].\n\nHypersonic flows are typically categorized by their total energy, expressed as total [[enthalpy]] (MJ/kg), total pressure (kPa-MPa), stagnation pressure (kPa-MPa), [[stagnation temperature]] (K), or flow velocity (km/s).\n\n[[Wallace D. Hayes]] developed a similarity parameter, similar to the [[area rule|Whitcomb area rule]], which allowed similar configurations to be compared.\n\n==Regimes==\nHypersonic flow can be approximately separated into a number of regimes. The selection of these regimes is rough, due to the blurring of the boundaries where a particular effect can be found.\n\n===Perfect gas===\nIn this regime, the gas can be regarded as an [[ideal gas]]. Flow in this regime is still Mach number dependent. Simulations start to depend on the use of a constant-temperature wall, rather than the adiabatic wall typically used at lower speeds. The lower border of this region is around Mach 5, where [[ramjet]]s become inefficient, and the upper border around Mach 10-12.\n\n===Two-temperature ideal gas===\nThis is a subset of the perfect gas regime, where the gas can be considered chemically perfect, but the rotational and vibrational temperatures of the gas must be considered separately, leading to two temperature models. See particularly the modeling of supersonic nozzles, where vibrational freezing becomes important.\n\n===Dissociated gas===\nIn this regime, diatomic or polyatomic gases (the gases found in most atmospheres) begin to [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] as they come into contact with the [[Shock wave|bow shock]] generated by the body. [[catalysis|Surface catalysis]] plays a role in the calculation of surface heating, meaning that the type of surface material also has an effect on the flow. The lower border of this regime is where any component of a gas mixture first begins to dissociate in the stagnation point of a flow (which for nitrogen is around 2000 K). At the upper border of this regime, the effects of [[ionization]] start to have an effect on the flow.\n\n===Ionized gas===\nIn this regime the [[ionization|ionized]] electron population of the stagnated flow becomes significant, and the electrons must be modeled separately. Often the electron temperature is handled separately from the temperature of the remaining gas components. This region occurs for freestream flow velocities around 10\u201312&nbsp;km/s. Gases in this region are modeled as non-radiating [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]].\n\n===Radiation-dominated regime===\nAbove around 12&nbsp;km/s, the heat transfer to a vehicle changes from being conductively dominated to radiatively dominated. The modeling of gases in this regime is split into two classes:\n#[[Optical depth|Optically thin]]: where the gas does not re-absorb radiation emitted from other parts of the gas\n#Optically thick: where the radiation must be considered a separate source of energy.\nThe modeling of optically thin gases is extremely difficult, since, due to the calculation of the radiation at each point, the computation load theoretically expands exponentially as the number of points considered increases.\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Supersonic transport]]\n*[[Lifting body]]\n*[[Atmospheric entry]]\n*[[Hypersonic flight]]\n*[[DARPA Falcon Project]]\n*[[Reaction Engines Skylon]] (design study)\n*[[Reaction Engines A2]] (design study)\n*[[HyperSoar]] (concept)\n*[[WaveRider|X-51 A Waverider]]\n*[[X-20 Dyna-Soar]] (cancelled)\n*[[Rockwell X-30]] (cancelled)\n*[[Avatar (spacecraft)|Avatar RLV]] (2001 Indian concept study)\n*[[Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle]] (Indian project)\n*[[Ayaks]] (Russian wave rider project from the 1990s)\n*[[Avangard (hypersonic glide vehicle)|Avangard]] (Russian hypersonic glide vehicle, in service)\n*[[DF-ZF]] (Chinese hypersonic Glide Vehicle, Operational)\n*[[Lockheed Martin SR-72]] (Planned)\n{{colend}}\n\n;Engines\n*[[Rocket engine]]\n*[[Ramjet]]\n*[[Scramjet]]\n*[[Reaction Engines SABRE]], [[LAPCAT]] (design studies)\n\n;Missiles\n*[[Shaurya (missile)]] Ballistic Missile - {{flagicon|India}} [[India]] (Entered Production)\n*[[BrahMos-II]] Cruise Missile - {{flagicon|India}} {{flagicon|Russia}} (Under Development)\n*[[9K720 Iskander]] Short-range ballistic missile {{flagicon|Russia}} [[Russia]] (Currently In Service)\n*[[3M22 Zircon]] Anti-ship hypersonic cruise missile {{flagicon|Russia}} (in production)\n*[[R-37 (missile)]] Hypersonic air-to-air missile {{flagicon|Russia}} (in service)\n*[[Kh-47M2 Kinzhal]] Hypersonic air-launched ballistic missile {{flagicon|Russia}} (in service)\n\n;Other flow regimes\n* [[Subsonic flight]]\n* [[Transonic]]\n* [[Supersonic speed]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Anderson|first=John|year=2006|title=Hypersonic and High-Temperature Gas Dynamics |edition=Second |publisher=AIAA Education Series|isbn=1-56347-780-7}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Hypersonics}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160412050110/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/BGH/index.html NASA's Guide to Hypersonics]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121011210111/http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/hypersonics Hypersonics Group at Imperial College]\n*[http://www.mech.uq.edu.au/hyper/ University of Queensland Centre for Hypersonics]\n*[http://seit.unsw.adfa.edu.au/research/activity.php?activity_id=42 High Speed Flow Group at University of New South Wales]\n*[http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/thermofluids/research/hypersonics-research-group Hypersonics Group at the University of Oxford]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hypersonic Speed}}\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Aerospace engineering]]\n[[Category:Airspeed]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft propulsion]]\n", "name_user": "Uanfala", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:more explicit hatnote", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_speed"}
