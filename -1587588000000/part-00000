It was held at the [[Losail International Circuit]] in [[Doha]] on 23 March 2014.\n\nIn the MotoGP class, [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]] began his title defence with a victory ahead of [[Valentino Rossi]] and teammate [[Dani Pedrosa]]. Rossi's teammate, Jorge Lorenzo led at the start but then crashed and had his bike destroyed in the gravel trap. \n\nThe MotoGP race also saw the d\u00e9but of the new \"Factory\" and \"Open\" classes for each bike. The MSMA prototypes were reclassified as the \"Factory\" class, and the Claiming Rule Teams sub-category was rebranded as the \"Open\" class. Bikes in the Open class used the same MotoGP ECU and identical software, and the teams that were in the Factory class were permitted to use their own software.\n\nIn the Moto2 race, [[Tito Rabat|Esteve Rabat]] began his title-winning season with a victory ahead of fellow [[Kalex]]  rider [[Mika Kallio]] and Suter rider [[Thomas L\u00fcthi]]. The fastest lap was set by [[Maverick Vi\u00f1ales]] in his first and only season in the Moto2 class.\n\nThe Moto3 race saw [[Jack Miller (motorcyclist)|Jack Miller]] take the victory ahead of Spaniards [[\u00c1lex M\u00e1rquez]] and [[Efr\u00e9n V\u00e1zquez]]. Both Miller and M\u00e1rquez would eventually fight for the title over the course of the season, with the latter eventually taking the title by two points.\n\n==Classification==\n===MotoGP===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n!

It was held at the [[Losail International Circuit]] in [[Doha]] on 23 March 2014.\n\nIn the MotoGP class, [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]] began his title defence with a victory ahead of [[Valentino Rossi]] and teammate [[Dani Pedrosa]]. Rossi's teammate, Jorge Lorenzo led at the start but then crashed and had his bike destroyed in the gravel trap. \n\nThe MotoGP race also saw the d\u00e9but of the new \"Factory\" and \"Open\" classes for each bike. The MSMA prototypes were reclassified as the \"Factory\" class, and the Claiming Rule Teams sub-category was rebranded as the \"Open\" class. Bikes in the Open class used the same MotoGP ECU and identical software, and the teams that were in the Factory class were permitted to use their own software.\n\nIn the Moto2 race, [[Tito Rabat|Esteve Rabat]] began his title-winning season with a victory ahead of fellow [[Kalex]]  rider [[Mika Kallio]] and Suter rider [[Thomas L\u00fcthi]]. The fastest lap was set by [[Maverick Vi\u00f1ales]] in his first and only season in the Moto2 class.\n\nThe Moto3 race saw [[Jack Miller (motorcyclist)|Jack Miller]] take the victory ahead of Spaniards [[\u00c1lex M\u00e1rquez]] and [[Efr\u00e9n V\u00e1zquez]]. Both Miller and M\u00e1rquez would eventually fight for the title over the course of the season, with the latter eventually taking the title by two points.\n\n==Classification==\n===MotoGP===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n!
