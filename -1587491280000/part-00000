With the dissolution of the League of Nations after [[World War II]], it was stipulated at the [[Yalta Conference]] that the remaining Mandates should be placed under the trusteeship of the [[United Nations]], subject to future discussions and formal agreements. Most of the remaining mandates of the League of Nations (with the exception of [[South-West Africa]]) thus eventually became [[United Nations Trust Territories]].\n\nTwo governing principles formed the core of the Mandate System, being non-annexation of the territory and its administration as a \u201csacred trust of civilization\u201d to develop the territory for the benefit of its native people.<ref>Matz, 2005, p.70-71, \"Primarily, two elements formed the core of the Mandate System, the principle of non-annexation of the territory on the one hand and its administration as a \u201csacred trust of civilization\u201d on the other... The principle of administration as a \u201csacred trust of civilization\u201d was designed to prevent a practice of imperial exploitation of the mandated territory in contrast to former colonial habits. Instead, the Mandatory\u2019s administration should assist in developing the territory for the well-being of its native people.\"</ref>\n\n==Basis==\nThe mandate system was established by Article 22 of the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]], drafted by the victors of [[World War I]]. The article referred to territories which after the war were no longer ruled by their previous sovereign, but their peoples were not considered \"able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world\". The article called for such people's tutelage to be \"entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of their resources, their experience or their geographical position can best undertake this responsibility\".<ref name=article22/>\n\n==Generalities==\nAll of the territories subject to League of Nations mandates were previously controlled by states defeated in World War I, principally [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The mandates were fundamentally different from the [[protectorate]]s in that the Mandatory power undertook obligations to the inhabitants of the territory and to the League of Nations.\n\nThe process of establishing the mandates consisted of two phases:\n#The formal removal of [[sovereignty]] of the state previously controlling the territory.\n#The transfer of mandatory powers to individual states among the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]].\n\n===Treaties===\nThe divestiture of Germany's overseas [[colonies]], along with three territories disentangled from its European homeland area (the [[Free City of Danzig]], [[Klaip\u0117da Region|Memel Territory]], and [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]]), was accomplished in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919), with the territories being allotted among the Allies on 7 May of that year.  Ottoman territorial claims were first addressed in the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] (1920) and finalized in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]].  The Turkish territories were allotted among the Allied Powers at the [[San Remo conference]] in 1920.\n\n==Types of mandates==\nThe League of Nations decided the exact level of control by the Mandatory power over each mandate on an individual basis. However, in every case the Mandatory power was forbidden to construct fortifications or raise an army within the territory of the mandate, and was required to present an annual report on the territory to the [[Permanent Mandates Commission]] of the League of Nations.\n\nThe mandates were divided into three distinct groups based upon the level of development each population had achieved at that time.\n\nThe first group, or ''Class A mandates'', were territories formerly controlled by the [[Ottoman Empire]] that were deemed to \"... have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory.\"\n\nThe second group of mandates, or ''Class B mandates'', were all former {{lang|de|Schutzgebiete}} (German territories) in [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]] which were deemed to require a greater level of control by the mandatory power: \"...the Mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee freedom of conscience and religion.\" The mandatory power was forbidden to construct military or naval bases within the mandates.\n\nThe ''Class C mandates'', including South West Africa and certain of the South Pacific Islands, were considered to be \"best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory\"\n\n==List of mandates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" width=\"100%\"\n|+\n|-\n!

Iraq is a Kingdom in regard to which Great Britain has undertaken responsibilities equivalent to those of a Mandatory Power. Under the British mandate, Palestine and Transjordan have each an entirely separate organization. We are, therefore, in the presence of three States sufficiently separate to be considered as distinct Parties. France has received a single mandate from the Council of the League of Nations, but in the countries subject to that mandate, one can distinguish two distinct States: Syria and the Lebanon, each State possessing its own constitution and a nationality clearly different from the other.<ref>See Marjorie M. Whiteman, Digest of International Law, vol. 1 (Washington, DC: U. S. Government Printing Office, 1963) pp. 650\u2013652, Questia, Web, 21 Apr. 2010</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Later history==\nAfter the [[United Nations]] was founded in 1945 and the League of Nations was disbanded, all but one of the mandated territories that remained under the control of the mandatory power became [[trust territories|United Nations trust territories]], a roughly equivalent status.<ref name=\"Pugh 321\u2013343\"/> In each case, the colonial power that held the mandate on each territory became the administering power of the trusteeship, except that Japan, which had been defeated in [[World War II]], lost its mandate over the South Pacific islands, which became a \"strategic trust territory\" known as the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] under [[United States]] administration.\n\nThe sole exception to the transformation of the League of Nations mandates into UN trusteeships was that South Africa refused to place South-West Africa under trusteeship. Instead, South Africa proposed that it be allowed to annex South-West Africa, a proposal rejected by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. The [[International Court of Justice]] held that South Africa continued to have international obligations under the mandate for South-West Africa. The territory finally attained [[independence]] in 1990 as [[Namibia]], after a long guerrilla war of independence against the [[apartheid]] regime.\n\nNearly all the former League of Nations mandates had become sovereign states by 1990, including all of the former United Nations Trust Territories with the exception of a few successor entities of the gradually dismembered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (formerly Japan's South Pacific Trust Mandate). These exceptions include the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] which is a [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] in [[political union]] with the [[United States]] with the status of [[Territories of the United States|unincorporated organized territory]]. The Northern Mariana Islands does elect its own [[Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands|governor]] to serve as territorial [[head of government]], but it remains a U.S. territory with its [[head of state]] being the [[President of the United States]] and [[Federal government of the United States|federal funds]] to the Commonwealth administered by the [[Office of Insular Affairs]] of the [[United States Department of the Interior]].\n\nRemnant [[Micronesia]] and the [[Marshall Islands]], the heirs of the last territories of the Trust, attained final independence on 22 December 1990.

These were of the nature of both a treaty and a constitution, which contained [[Minority Treaties|minority rights clauses]] that provided for the rights of petition and adjudication by the International Court.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970)|journal=International Court of Justice|date=21 June 1971|pages=28\u201332|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/53/5595.pdf|accessdate=28 August 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106103217/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/53/5595.pdf|archivedate=6 January 2015|df=}}</ref> \n\nThe mandate system was established under Article 22 of the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]], entered into force on 28 June 1919. With the dissolution of the League of Nations after [[World War II]], it was stipulated at the [[Yalta Conference]] that the remaining Mandates should be placed under the trusteeship of the [[United Nations]], subject to future discussions and formal agreements. Most of the remaining mandates of the League of Nations (with the exception of [[South-West Africa]]) thus eventually became [[United Nations Trust Territories]].\n\nTwo governing principles formed the core of the Mandate System, being non-annexation of the territory and its administration as a \u201csacred trust of civilization\u201d to develop the territory for the benefit of its native people.<ref>Matz, 2005, p.70-71, \"Primarily, two elements formed the core of the Mandate System, the principle of non-annexation of the territory on the one hand and its administration as a \u201csacred trust of civilization\u201d on the other... The principle of administration as a \u201csacred trust of civilization\u201d was designed to prevent a practice of imperial exploitation of the mandated territory in contrast to former colonial habits. Instead, the Mandatory\u2019s administration should assist in developing the territory for the well-being of its native people.\"</ref>\n\n==Basis==\nThe mandate system was established by Article 22 of the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]], drafted by the victors of [[World War I]]. The article referred to territories which after the war were no longer ruled by their previous sovereign, but their peoples were not considered \"able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world\". The article called for such people's tutelage to be \"entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of their resources, their experience or their geographical position can best undertake this responsibility\".<ref name=article22/>\n\n==Generalities==\nAll of the territories subject to League of Nations mandates were previously controlled by states defeated in World War I, principally [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The mandates were fundamentally different from the [[protectorate]]s in that the Mandatory power undertook obligations to the inhabitants of the territory and to the League of Nations.\n\nThe process of establishing the mandates consisted of two phases:\n#The formal removal of [[sovereignty]] of the state previously controlling the territory.\n#The transfer of mandatory powers to individual states among the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]].\n\n===Treaties===\nThe divestiture of Germany's overseas [[colonies]], along with three territories disentangled from its European homeland area (the [[Free City of Danzig]], [[Klaip\u0117da Region|Memel Territory]], and [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]]), was accomplished in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919), with the territories being allotted among the Allies on 7 May of that year.  Ottoman territorial claims were first addressed in the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] (1920) and finalized in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]].  The Turkish territories were allotted among the Allied Powers at the [[San Remo conference]] in 1920.\n\n==Types of mandates==\nThe League of Nations decided the exact level of control by the Mandatory power over each mandate on an individual basis. However, in every case the Mandatory power was forbidden to construct fortifications or raise an army within the territory of the mandate, and was required to present an annual report on the territory to the [[Permanent Mandates Commission]] of the League of Nations.\n\nThe mandates were divided into three distinct groups based upon the level of development each population had achieved at that time.\n\nThe first group, or ''Class A mandates'', were territories formerly controlled by the [[Ottoman Empire]] that were deemed to \"... have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory.\"\n\nThe second group of mandates, or ''Class B mandates'', were all former {{lang|de|Schutzgebiete}} (German territories) in [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]] which were deemed to require a greater level of control by the mandatory power: \"...the Mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee freedom of conscience and religion.\" The mandatory power was forbidden to construct military or naval bases within the mandates.\n\nThe ''Class C mandates'', including South West Africa and certain of the South Pacific Islands, were considered to be \"best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory\"\n\n==List of mandates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" width=\"100%\"\n|+\n|-\n!

The treaty also let the States acquire, without payment, all the property and possessions of the Ottoman Empire situated within their territory.<ref name=\"Lausanne\">[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne Article 47, 60, and Protocol XII, Article 9 of the Treaty of Lausanne]</ref> The treaty provided that the League of Nations was responsible for establishing an arbitral court to resolve disputes that might arise and stipulated that its decisions were final.<ref name=\"Lausanne\"/>\n\nA disagreement regarding the legal status and the portion of the annuities to be paid by the \"A\" mandates was settled when an Arbitrator ruled that some of the mandates contained more than one State:<blockquote>The difficulty arises here how one is to regard the Asiatic countries under the British and French mandates. Iraq is a Kingdom in regard to which Great Britain has undertaken responsibilities equivalent to those of a Mandatory Power. Under the British mandate, Palestine and Transjordan have each an entirely separate organization. We are, therefore, in the presence of three States sufficiently separate to be considered as distinct Parties. France has received a single mandate from the Council of the League of Nations, but in the countries subject to that mandate, one can distinguish two distinct States: Syria and the Lebanon, each State possessing its own constitution and a nationality clearly different from the other.<ref>See Marjorie M.

Government Printing Office, 1963) pp. 650\u2013652, Questia, Web, 21 Apr. 2010</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Later history==\nAfter the [[United Nations]] was founded in 1945 and the League of Nations was disbanded, all but one of the mandated territories that remained under the control of the mandatory power became [[trust territories|United Nations trust territories]], a roughly equivalent status.<ref name=\"Pugh 321\u2013343\"/> In each case, the colonial power that held the mandate on each territory became the administering power of the trusteeship, except that Japan, which had been defeated in [[World War II]], lost its mandate over the South Pacific islands, which became a \"strategic trust territory\" known as the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] under [[United States]] administration.\n\nThe sole exception to the transformation of the League of Nations mandates into UN trusteeships was that South Africa refused to place South-West Africa under trusteeship. Instead, South Africa proposed that it be allowed to annex South-West Africa, a proposal rejected by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. The [[International Court of Justice]] held that South Africa continued to have international obligations under the mandate for South-West Africa. The territory finally attained [[independence]] in 1990 as [[Namibia]], after a long guerrilla war of independence against the [[apartheid]] regime.\n\nNearly all the former League of Nations mandates had become sovereign states by 1990, including all of the former United Nations Trust Territories with the exception of a few successor entities of the gradually dismembered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (formerly Japan's South Pacific Trust Mandate). These exceptions include the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] which is a [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] in [[political union]] with the [[United States]] with the status of [[Territories of the United States|unincorporated organized territory]]. The Northern Mariana Islands does elect its own [[Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands|governor]] to serve as territorial [[head of government]], but it remains a U.S. territory with its [[head of state]] being the [[President of the United States]] and [[Federal government of the United States|federal funds]] to the Commonwealth administered by the [[Office of Insular Affairs]] of the [[United States Department of the Interior]].\n\nRemnant [[Micronesia]] and the [[Marshall Islands]], the heirs of the last territories of the Trust, attained final independence on 22 December 1990. (The UN Security Council ratified termination of trusteeship, effectively dissolving trusteeship status, on 10 July 1987). The [[Palau|Republic of Palau]], split off from the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], became the last to get its independence effectively on 1 October 1994.\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Paris Peace Conference sidebox}}\n===Sources and references===\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Wright|first=Quincy|authorlink=Quincy Wright|title=Mandates Under the League of Nations|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027342156|year=1968|publisher=Greenwood Press}}\n* Nele Matz, [http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_matz_9_47_95.pdf Civilization and the Mandate System under the League of Nations as Origin of Trusteeship], in: A. von Bogdandy and R.

Established on 14 May 1892, Vitesse is one of the oldest professional football clubs in the [[Eredivisie]]. Since 1998, the club has played its home games at the [[GelreDome]]. \n\nVitesse had its most successful period in the 1990s. Their best result in the Eredivisie was third place in 1997\u201398. They won the [[KNVB Cup]] in [[2016\u201317 KNVB Cup|2017]] and also reached the final in 1912, 1927 and 1990. Throughout the years, Vitesse established itself as a stepping stone for future world class players like [[Raimond van der Gouw]], [[Philip Cocu]], [[Roy Makaay]], [[Sander Westerveld]], [[Nikos Machlas]], [[Pierre van Hooijdonk]], [[Mahamadou Diarra]], [[Nemanja Mati\u0107]], [[Marco van Ginkel]], [[Davy Pr\u00f6pper]], [[Wilfried Bony]], [[Mason Mount]] and [[Martin \u00d8degaard]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Vitesse kampioen van Oosten 1896.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Vitesse's first squad in 1896.]]\n[[Image:Vitesse 1913.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Vitesse's first squad in 1913.]]\n[[Image:Vitesse tegen Ajax 1-3 in KNVB-beker.

The roots of Vitesse actually pre-dated Sparta by a year as in 1887, a club with the name \"Arnhemsche cricket- en voetbalvereeniging Vitesse\" was formed by a group of high school students who played their sport on the Rijnkade, overlooking the River [[Rhine]] in the city centre. Reluctant to choose a Latin or English name for the club as they felt those languages were too elitist, they picked the French word ''Vitesse'', meaning \"speed\".\n\nIn 1891 the club disbanded as they were no longer able to find anywhere suitable to play cricket after a Velodrome was built on their usual playing field in the Klarenbeek Park. The following year a group of wealthy students resurrected the sports club, this time with the name '''AVC''' (Arnhemse Voetbal en Cricketclub) Vitesse. In the summer they played cricket and in the winter football. In the end of 1892, Vitesse played its first real football match, and in 1894 Vitesse disbanded the cricket branch. In 1895 and 1896 Vitesse became champions of the Gelderland competition. From the foundation of the Dutch national football championship in 1898 until 1954, the title was decided through play-offs by a handful of clubs who had previously won their regional league. Vitesse lost the final of the [[Eredivisie|national championship]] six times ''(1898, 1899, 1903, 1913, 1914 and 1915)''.\n\nIn 1912, Vitesse reached the final of the Dutch Cup Tournament for the first time. Vitesse lost the final with 0\u20132 from [[HFC Haarlem]]. In this period Vitesse had top players, likes [[Willem Hesselink]] and [[Just G\u00f6bel]]. This players were also active in the Dutch national team. In 1914 John William Sutcliffe became the first foreign trainer.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Vitesse didn't play-official matches because playing football in the open air was forbidden. During the [[Battle of Arnhem]], the residents of the city were forcibly evicted from their homes, allowing the Germans to turn the north bank of the Rhine into a heavily defended line. Residents were not allowed to return home without a permit and most did not return until after the war. The football field and clubhouse was completely destroyed. The damage was repaired in the years after the liberation.\n\nIn 1984 it was decided to divide the professional and amateur sections of the club. The professional section was renamed '''SBV''' (Stichting Betaald Voetbal \u2013 \"Professional Football Foundation\") Vitesse whilst the amateur section became \"Vitesse 1892\", which lasted until they disbanded in 2009.\n\nFrom 1984, [[Karel Aalbers]] was the president of SBV Vitesse. Aalbers' goal was to bring Vitesse from the bottom of the Second League (Eerste divisie, now [[Eerste Divisie|Jupiler League]]), the league in which the club originated, to the top 40 soccer clubs of Europe. He developed the basic idea for the '[[Gelredome]]', a stadium with a sliding pitch that can be moved out of the building. Later, the same system was applied in [[Gelsenkirchen]] ([[Schalke 04]]) and in [[Japan]]. Events such as pop concerts can be held without damaging the grass. Gelredome opened in 1998. It has a roof that can be opened and closed. It is fully climate controlled as well. In the first season after the opening, Gelredome's attendance rose to 20,000, (from less than 8,000 in the old stadium).\n\nVitesse made their debut in European competition in 1990. The club won their first match in the first round 1\u20130 over [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]].\n\nThe club remained financially sound through making notable profits on the transfer market. Players such as [[Roy Makaay]], [[Sander Westerveld]], [[Nikos Machlas]], [[Glenn Helder]] and [[Phillip Cocu|Philip Cocu]] were sold for large sums of money. Others came to occupy empty player positions, such as [[Mahamadou Diarra]] and [[Pierre van Hooijdonk]]. Vitesse finished in top 4 positions, made profits and showed a solid balance sheet in the final years of Aalbers' presidency. Also, the club became regular competitors in the UEFA Cup and in 1997\u20131998 finished third in the Eredivise, its record highest finish to date.\n\n[[Herbert Neumann]] was Vitesse's manager over most of these years (1992\u201395 and 1998\u201399), while star players included: Nikos Machlas, the first ever Vitesse player to win the European Golden Boot in 1998 when he scored 34 goals in a season; [[John van den Brom]], who played 378 matches for Vitesse during this period scoring 110 goals from midfield; and [[Edward Sturing]], who played 383 matches in defence for Vitesse from 1987 to 1998, as well as receiving 3 caps for the Netherlands national team. Additional stars included [[Dejan \u010curovi\u0107]], who spent six years at Vitesse playing 109 matches as a striker, scoring 41 goals including the first goal in GelreDome. Meanwhile, Dutch forward Roy Makaay spent four years at Vitesse, scoring 42 goals in 109 matches between 1993 and 1997.\n\nAalbers resigned on 15 February 2000,<ref>{{cite news | last = Ritsema | first = Andr\u00e9 | title = Aalbers moet bij Vitesse weg als voorzitter | work = [[NRC Handelsblad]] | language = Dutch | date = 16 February 2000 | url = http://www.nrc.nl/W2/Nieuws/2000/02/16/Spo/01.html | accessdate = 21 September 2008}}</ref> after the main sponsor, Nuon, threatened to pull the plug if he did not. Nuon, as a public utility company owned by local authorities, had trouble explaining why it invested heavily in Aalbers' ambitious plans. His successor was Jan Koning (former chief of Sara Lee/DE who resigned after four months). In a short period of time, Vitesse began to show negative financial results due to poor deals on the transfer market. The club survived numerous financial crises, such as the last one in 2008, when debts were bought off, under the threat of bankruptcy.\n\nThe club was in serious financial trouble, and in August 2010 its majority shareholder agreed to sell the club to the Georgian businessman [[Merab Jordania]]. There was rumors that this purchase was engineered by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] owner Roman Abramovich. The club underwent a successful transformation into a modern, commercial sports organization and established itself as one of the dominant teams of the Eredivisie.\n\nOn 1 July 2012, [[Fred Rutten]] signed a contract as the new manager of Vitesse, for the season [[2012\u201313 Eredivisie|2012-13]]. Rutten left Vitesse after the season, finishing in 4th place. [[Wilfried Bony]] ended the season as the [[Eredivisie#Top scorers|Eredivisie's top scorer]] with 31 goals in 30 matches and was awarded the [[Dutch Footballer of the Year|Golden Shoe]] for the best player in the Netherlands.\n\nFor the 2013\u201314 season, Vitesse appointed [[Peter Bosz]] as its new manager. In November 2013, Vitesse was top of the league in the Eredivisie for the first time since 2006. It was the first time since 2000 they'd been top of the league later than the first week. Halfway through the season, after 17 matches, Vitesse was the leader in the competition. Key players in the squad from this period included [[Davy Pr\u00f6pper]], [[Christian Atsu]] and [[Bertrand Traor\u00e9]].\n\nVitesse announced on 13 June 2016 that [[Henk Fraser]] would replace Bosz at the start of the [[2016\u201317 Eredivisie|2016\u201317]] season. In his first full season, won the club first major trophy in its 125-year existence.

In the [[2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League]] group stage, Vitesse's opponents were [[Lazio Roma]], [[OGC Nice]] and [[Zulte Waregem]]. Vitesse ultimately finished the group stage in fourth place. In October 2017, [[Guram Kashia]] wore a rainbow-striped captain's armband for Vitesse against Heracles Almelo in support of [[LGBT]] rights, leading to a backlash in his own country. In August 2018, he became the inaugural recipient of UEFA's #EqualGame award for his act.<ref>{{cite news |title=Guram Kashia: Georgia captain becomes first recipient of Uefa #EqualGame award |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45274881 |accessdate=23 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2018, it was announced that [[Leonid Slutsky (football coach)|Leonid Slutsky]] would replace Henk Fraser as the new manager of Vitesse, for the start of the 2018&ndash;19 season. Under his tenure, Vitesse entered the draw for the third qualifying round of the Europa League, being drawn against seeded [[FC Basel]]. Vitesse lost 2\u20130 on aggregate, resulting in their elimination from the Europa League. At the domestic level, Vitesse finished fifth in the Eredivisie from that season. Missing out on Europe was a blow for Vitesse and Slutsky will be hoping his team can challenge for a top three spot next season. After five lost games in a row, he decided to quit with his job as manager from Vitesse at the end of November 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/l/2312612|title=Sloetski stapt op als trainer van Vitesse|work=nos.nl|accessdate=29 November 2019|language=nl}}</ref> On 30 December 2019, Vitesse appointed Edward Sturing yet again as their manager.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[Image:GelreDome 4.png|thumb|GelreDome with closed roof and pitch outside.]]\n[[Image:Gelredome Binnenkant.jpg|GelreDome Stadium|thumb]]\n[[Image:Stadium_locations_Vitesse_Arnhem.jpg|Locations|thumb]]\n\n===Stadium===\n{{main|GelreDome}}\nThe GelreDome is the home stadium of Vitesse, one of the largest stadiums in the Netherlands. The stadium has a retractable roof and a convertible pitch that can be retracted when unused during concerts or other events held at the stadium. GelreDome has the reputation of being one of the most family-friendly football stadiums in the country.\n\nIn 1998, the GelreDome replaced the [[Nieuw Monnikenhuize]]. The stadium was able to hold 12,000 people in a mix of seats and standing, however with the addition of temporary bleachers it could be raised to 18,000. After the increasing popularity of Vitesse in the 1990s, it became obvious that the traditional ground was too small for the increasing number of Vitesse supporters. The much-loved Nieuw Monnikenhuize Stadion was torn down and the land was sold to the city council. A residential neighbourhood now occupies the area.\n\nThe GelreDome currently holds a four-star rating by [[UEFA]]. Three international matches of the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national football team]] were played in the stadium, the first one being on 27 May 1998: a friendly against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] (0\u20131). The last one, played on 26 April 2000, was also a friendly: a 0\u20130 against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. Furthermore, the GelreDome was the location for three [[UEFA Euro 2000]] group stage matches, as well as the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] tournament. Aside from football-related purposes, the ground is occasionally used for music concerts\n\nThe stadium has a maximum capacity of 21,000 people for sports events, or 41,000 during concerts. The GelreDome pitch is surrounded on each side by four covered all-seater stands, officially known as the [[Edward Sturing|Edward Sturing Stand (North)]], [[Henk Bosveld|Charly Bosveld Stand (East)]], [[Theo Bos (footballer)|Theo Bos Stand (South)]] and [[Just G\u00f6bel|Just G\u00f6bel Stand (West)]]. The stadium is near a highway interchange and only a few minutes' drive from the main railway station in Arnhem. Furthermore, there is a bus stop near GelreDome.\n\n====Stadium history====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#0D4C92; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"| Name !! style=\"background:#0D4C92; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"| Location !! style=\"background:#0D4C92; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"| Years \n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Rijnkade / Klarenbeek Park\n|[[Arnhem]]-Centrum / Klarenbeek, Arnhem-North\n|1887\u20131891\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Molenbeekstraat\n|Molenbeke, Arnhem-North\n|1892\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|IJsclub Boulevard Heuvelink\n|Spijkerkwartier, Arnhem-North\n|1892\u20131894\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Bronbeek|Bronbeek Royal Palace]]\n|Paasberg, Arnhem-North\n|1893\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Paasweide\n|De Preats, Arnhem-South\n|1894\u20131896\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Klarenbeek Stadium\n|Klarenbeek, Arnhem-North\n|1896\u20131915\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Monnikenhuize]]\n|Monnikenhuize, Arnhem-North\n|1915\u20131950\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Nieuw Monnikenhuize]]\n|Monnikenhuize, Arnhem-North\n|1950\u20131997\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[GelreDome]]\n|Malburgen, Arnhem-South\n|1998\u2013present\n|-\n|}\n\n===Training ground===\nTraining sessions by Vitesse are conducted at [[National Sports Centre Papendal|Papendal]], located in the outskirts of Arnhem in woodland surroundings. Papendal is also the home base of [[NOC*NSF]]. Vitesse moved to Papendal in 1998. With the opening of the GelreDome, the old training facility was closed down. The new training facilities at Papendal were completed in 2013. The complex has been inspired by [[Cobham Training Centre]]. Even though the Papendal complex is of a more modest format, it has many similar facilities, such as a weight training room, a state-of-the-art therapy bath, a steam room, sports medical rooms, a press reception area and separate restaurants for visitors and players.\n\nOn the grounds, there are 6 full size football pitches of which one is astro turf. A stand has been built at the Academy's main pitch, with a capacity of over 500 people. The reserve squad and academy teams all play their matches here. The complex is situated in large wooded area, where the players can prepare in a peaceful and private environment, whilst not being too far from the hustle and bustle of Arnhem's city centre.\n\nBesides having the most advanced and up-to-date sports and training complexes, Papendal is also the base for administration staff, scouting department and all club coaches. There are eleven dressing rooms, physiotherapy suites and a base for the medical staff, including a consulting room.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Entree Papendal.png|Entrance to Papendal\nFile:Accommodatie Vitesse Papendal.png|Training accommodation at Papendal\nFile:Hoofdveld Vitesse Papendal.jpg|Main football field of Vitesse, where the youth plays their competitions\nFile:20190307 Netherlands, Arnhem, Vitesse, onderwaterloopband (46) - small size Wetransfer.jpg|Therapy bath\nFile:Vooraanzicht Hotel Papendal.jpg|Hotel Papendal\n</gallery>\n\n==Symbols==\n[[File:Hertog.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Vitesse's crest is composed of an eagle.]]\n[[File:Theo Bos.jpg|right|thumb|150px|''Mister Vitesse'' [[Theo Bos (footballer)|Theo Bos]]]]\n\n===Hertog===\nVitesse are well known for the [[Bald eagle|American bald Eagle]] 'Hertog', which is released before the match and flies over the crowds.\n\n===Colours===\nOriginally, Vitesse played in white shirts with a blue sash from inception until 1900, paying hommage to the city\u2019s colours. At the turn of the century, player Reinhard Jan Christiaan baron van Pallandt offered to sponsor the club\u2019s shirts in exchange for Vitesse switching to his family colours of black and yellow. The board were quick to accept, noting that Vitesse, being one of the strongest team in the province of Gelderland, would be vindicated in playing in what could also be considered the province\u2019s colours (the [[flag of Gelderland]] is a tricolour in blue, yellow, and black).\n\n===Anthems===\nVitesse fans are known to be creative and have various songs and chants during matches. Among the most important Vitesse songs are \"Geel en Zwart zijn onze kleuren\" by Emile Hartkamp, and \"Bouw mee aan een steengoed Vites!\" by Henk Bleker & Enka Harmonie. Vitesse opens its home matches with \"Whatever You Want\" by [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], and after every home goal \"[[Bro Hymn]]\" by [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]] is played.\n\n===Mr Vitesse===\n[[Theo Bos (footballer)|Theo Bos]] was raised in [[Arnhem]] and started playing football from an early age. He began his career at amateur club Sv Sempre Avanti and played from 1979-1983 in the academy of Vitesse. Manager [[Leen Looijen]] gave him his professional debut on 13 August 1983 against [[FC Wageningen]]; the match ended in a 3\u20130 victory for Vitesse. Bos spent his entire playing career for Vitesse, making a total 369 appearances in 14 seasons with his club. After his playing career, Bos worked at Vitesse as youth coach, assistant coach and manager. He is therefore considered to be ''Mister Vitesse''. In 2012, the south stand of the [[GelreDome]] stadium was named the Theo Bos Stand. Bos died on 28 February 2013 of [[pancreatic cancer]], aged forty-seven. Following his death, a special remembrance to honour Theo Bos took place at Gelredome with around 7,000 Vitesse supporters. As of the 2012\u201313 season, no player could wear the number 4 shirt at Vitesse after the club decided to retire the shirt out of respect for Theo Bos, \"the legendary number four\". Dutch defender [[Jan-Arie van der Heijden]] was the last player to wear the number. In November 2013, his biography ''Het is zoals het is'' ('It is what it is') was published, written by journalist Marcel van Roosmalen. In 2015, a statue of Bos was erected outside of the training complex at [[National Sports Centre Papendal|Papendal]].\n\n====Other club legends====\nBelow is a list with members who have established themselves as club legends: \n{{col-begin-small}}\n{{col-3}}\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Willem Hesselink]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Just G\u00f6bel]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Frans de Munck]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Henk Bosveld]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Karel Aalbers]] \n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Bert Jacobs]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Edward Sturing]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Frans Thijssen]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[John van den Brom]] \n{{col-3}}\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Martin Laamers]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Raimond van der Gouw]] \n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Ben Hofs]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Nicky Hofs]] \n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Ricky van Wolfswinkel]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Theo Janssen]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Marc van Hintum]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Herman Veenendaal]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Gerrit Horsten]]\n{{col-3}}\n*{{flagicon|Bosnia and Herzegovina}} [[Bo\u0161ko Bursa\u0107]]\n*{{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Dejan \u010curovi\u0107]] \n*{{flagicon|Greece}} [[Nikos Machlas]] \n*{{flagicon|Georgia}} [[Guram Kashia]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} Cor Guijt\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} Jan Snellenburg\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} Martin Esveld\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} Jan Dommering \n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} Dik Herberts\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Airborne-match===\n[[Image:Airborne_match_Vitesse_Arnhem.jpg|right|thumb|The 'Airborne memorial' football match]]\nAround September there is an annual 'Airborne memorial' football match. During this annual Airborne-match the veterans of [[World War II]] will be honored. The Gelredome is decorated with Airborne flags, both outside and inside the stadium, and at halftime, 120 members of the Royal British Legion played the bagpipes with some other musical guests. Clubsymbol Hertog fly with the typical Airborne colors. The match is traditionally visited by veterans who were fighting in this battle, while a special shirt is worn by Vitesse. The club drop their normal striped black and yellow kit for this special match. Instead they wear claret and blue outfits, the same colours of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]], with a 1st Airborne 'winged horse' emblem also etched on the kit. Pictured on the collar sticker is the [[John Frost Bridge]]. These shirts are after the match auctioned for charity. In addition, Vitesse wearing a special captain's armband as a sign of recognition and respect for those who have fought for our freedom.\n\nIn the 2014\u201315 and 2019\u201320 seasons, Vitesse played their away games in the same colours of the 1st Airborne Division.\n\nIn 2012, Peters was at the Gelredome watching Vitesse, and after the Airborne match, captain [[Guram Kashia]] went over to veteran to express his thanks for coming to the match, gave him his shirt (which Peters donated to the [[Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum|Airborne Assault Museum]] in [[Cambridge]]), stood at what we'll loosely call attention, and saluted Peters. When asked about it, Kashia simply said \"I want to show them respect, they are heroes.\" A year later, on the match commemorating, the Vitesse supporters unveiled a banner capturing the moment between Peters and Kashia. Johnny Peters died on 8 August 2014 after a short illness.\n\n''Veteranen van Vitesse'' is a television documentary on [[Fox Sports (Netherlands)|FOX Sports]]. It premiered on 24 November 2014.\n\n===Crest===\nThe first logo of Vitesse was a shield-shaped crest. In the middle there was a diagonal dividing line between the left yellow face and the right black box. In the left box, \"AVC Vitesse\" was diagonally written and in the right-hand side, \"1892 \", the club's founding year. The old logo was replaced in 1984, the year in which the roads of the BVO branch and the amateur branch separated. The amateur branch retained the logo with limited modification, SBV Vitesse got a new logo.\n\nThe new logo of the BVO from 1984 is once again a shield-shaped figure, but it has straight lines at both the top and sides of the logo. At the top is with thick white uppercase Vitesse. Under the name is a double-headed eagle, with left and right half mirrored. Also the colors are mirrored, which is left yellow is black right and vice versa. This double-headed eagle can also be found in the coat of arms of Arnhem. In the middle of the logo is a football positioned.\n\nIn the autumn of 2011, a new version of the logo was put into use; A total of 13 changes have been made. For example, the symmetry of the eagle was improved, the black outer edge replaced by a white and in the writing has been made thinner. The football has been altered in terms of appearance as a shadow effect is added and (if the context allows it) the year of creation as text EST. 1892 under the logo can be found.\n\nThere was also a special anniversary crest to celebrate the 125th (2017) anniversary of the club.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vitesse Logo jaren 70 1.png|The first Vitesse crest\nFile:Vitesse Logo jaren 70 2.png|The second crest\nFile:Vitesse logo.svg|The third crest\nFile:SBV Vitesse logo.svg|2011\u2013present \n</gallery>\n\n===Kit===\nVitesse wore sponsored shirts for the first time in the [[1982\u201383 Eredivisie|1982\u201383 season]], to promote the [[Akai]]. The club signed its first kit manufacturing deal with the German firm [[adidas]]. The kit is being produced by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] for the 2019\u201320 season.\n{{col-begin-small}}\n{{col-4}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\"\n! Years !!

club are known as ''Vitessenaren''. Vitesse has two independent fan bodies. The ''Supportersvereniging Vitesse'' was founded in 1992 and currently consists of 3,000 members. They own a fan base within the GelreDome. The second one, ''Arnhem Ultras'', serve a more specific purpose: to improve the atmosphere in the stadium. Besides the fan unions, there are several sets of fans who work together on tifo choreography, likes ''VIVO (Vitesse Is van Ons)'', ''De Aftrap'' and ''VAK 113'' among others. Nowadays, Vitesse is supported by one fanatic side: The ''Theo Bos \u2013 South Stand''. This stand is responsible for a big part of the atmosphere in the stadium.\n\nVitesse have attracted around 18,000 people to Eredivisie matches on average in the last years. The record attendance stands at 26,600, achieved in a match against [[NAC Breda]] at 25 March 1998. Research showed that about 10,000 season ticket holders from [[Gelderland]], with other significant groups coming from [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], [[South Holland]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n\nThe ''Vitesse Kids Club'' was founded by Vitesse in 1998 for children up to 16 years. Every year, the ''Vitesse Kids Club Day'' is organized, offering activities for members who are joined by the first team squad. During pre-season, Vitesse also holds an Open Day for people of all ages; the event gives the opportunity for sponsors and new player signings to be presented.\n\nVitesse fans have established a close friendship with the supporters of [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]] and [[RFC de Li\u00e8ge]]. Back in the days they had a friendship with [[Lierse SK]] till there was a big riot between them at a friendly match in 2011.\n\n==Rivalries==\n===Rivalry with N.E.C.===\n[[N.E.C. (football club)|NEC]] from [[Nijmegen]] are Vitesse's archrivals. The two clubs share a long history together and matches between the two clubs are called the Gelderse Derby ''(Derby of Gelderland)''. The rivalry between these two clubs goes beyond the football rivalry, it transcends into the city rivalry between the two largest cities of [[Gelderland]]: Nijmegen and [[Arnhem]]. This city rivalry began when these two cities first received their city rights. The two cities are just 20 kilometres apart, leading to an intense feeling of a cross-town rivalry, heightened by a feeling that local pride is at stake. The meeting between the two teams is still considered to be one of the biggest matches of the season.\n\nThe inhabitants of these cities differ extremely in both attitudes and cultures which is clearly reflected on to the football pitch. Vitesse's style of play has long been a source of pride for the supporters, and one of irritation for the NEC fans.\n\nSince 1813, Arnhem has been the capital of Gelderland, historically based on finance and trade. Arnhem is perceived as an office city with modern buildings. Nijmegen, on the other hand, is predominantly a workers' city, with middle and high-income groups in the minority.

Nijmegen. The rivalry has existed for some time with De Graafschap and stems from various causes, such as the opposition between the large city (Arnhem) and the countryside ([[Doetinchem]]).\n\nFurther teams who share a rivalry with Vitesse include [[FC Twente]] and [[AFC Ajax]]. Past rivalries include local derbies between Vitesse and clubs such as [[FC Wageningen]], [[Go Ahead Eagles]], [[Quick 1888]], Arnhemse Boys and VV Rheden. However, the tension between the local sides lessened as the division of the clubs through playing in different leagues over time became greater. Years of not competing in the same league resulted in less frequent match-ups, until tensions finally settled between the local clubs.\n\n==Players==\n===Current squad===\n{{updated|3 February 2020}}<ref>http://www.vitesse.nl/en/first-team/selection</ref>\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=1 |nat= GRE |name=[[Kostas Lamprou]]|pos=GK|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=2 |nat= NED |name=[[Julian Lelieveld]]|pos=DF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=3 |nat= NED |name=[[Armando Obispo]]|pos=DF|Name=|other=<small>on loan from [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]]</small>}} \n{{Fs player|no=5 |nat= ENG |name=[[Max Clark (footballer)|Max Clark]]|pos=DF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=7 |nat= NED |pos=FW|name=[[Jay-Roy Grot]]|other=<small>on loan from [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=8 |nat= NOR |name=[[Sondre Tronstad]]|pos=MF|Name=}}\n{{Fs player|no=9 |nat= SLO |name=[[Tim Matav\u017e]]|pos=FW|other=<small>[[Captain (association football)|vice captain]]</small>}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat= NED |name=[[Riechedly Bazoer]]|pos=MF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat= NED |name=[[Bryan Linssen]]|pos=MF|other=<small>[[Captain (association football)|captain]]</small>}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat= MAR |name=[[Oussama Tannane]]|pos=MF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat= NOR |name=[[Filip Delaveris]]|pos=FW|Name=}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat= NED |name=[[Roy Beerens]]|pos=FW|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat= ISR |name=[[Eli Dasa]]|pos=DF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat= CZE |name=[[Tom\u00e1\u0161 H\u00e1jek]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat= NGA |name=[[Hilary Gong]]|pos=FW|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat= MLI |name=[[Nouha Dicko]]|pos=FW|Name=|other=<small>on loan from [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]</small>}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat= SVK |name=[[Mat\u00fa\u0161 Bero]]|pos=MF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat= NED |name=[[Remko Pasveer]]|pos=GK|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat= BEL |name=[[Charly Musonda (footballer, born 1996)|Charly Musonda]]|pos=FW|Name=|other=<small>on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]</small>}}\n{{Fs player|no=28|nat= NED |name=[[Joshua Brenet]]|pos=DF|Name=|other=<small>on loan from [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|1899 Hoffenheim]]</small>}} \n{{Fs player|no=29|nat= NED |name=[[Thomas Buitink]]|pos=FW|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=30|nat= NED |name=[[Danilho Doekhi]]|pos=DF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=32|nat= NED |name=\u00d6zg\u00fcr Aktas|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=36|nat= NED |name=[[Patrick Vroegh]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=37|nat= NED |name=[[Yassin Oukili]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=38|nat= NED |name=[[Richie Musaba]]|pos=MF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=40|nat= NED |name=Bilal Bayazit|pos=GK|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n''For recent transfers, see [[2019\u201320 SBV Vitesse season]].''\n\n===Players out on loan===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= NED |name=[[Jeroen Houwen]]|pos=GK|Name=|other=<small>on loan at [[Go Ahead Eagles]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= NED |name=[[Khalid Karami]]|pos=DF|Name=|other=<small>on loan at [[Sparta Rotterdam]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= NED |name=[[Thomas Bruns]]|pos=MF|Name=|other=<small>on loan at [[VVV-Venlo]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= ALG |name=[[Oussama Darfalou]]|pos=FW|Name=|other=<small>on loan at [[VVV-Venlo]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Reserve team (Under-21)===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=2|nat= NED |name=Brend Leeflang|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=3|nat= NED |name=\u00d6zg\u00fcr Aktas|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|nat= NED |name=Younes Zakir|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=5|nat= NED |name=Aaron Sieders|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=6|nat= NED |name=[[Yassin Oukili]]|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=7|nat= NED |name=[[Lars ten Teije]]|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat= NED |name=[[Patrick Vroegh]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat= NED |name=Roy Kuijpers|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat= NED |name=Joey Kesting|pos=GK|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat= NED |name=Paul Fosu Mensah|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat= NED |name=Aness Serghini|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat= SER |name=Nikolas Agrafiotis|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=-|nat= NED |name=Danny M\u00fchl|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=-|nat= NED |name=Jasper Dahlhaus|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Youth teams===\nThe club also have 10 further youth teams: Under-19, Under-17, Under-16, Under-15, Under-14, Under-13, Under-12, Under-11, Under-10 and Under-9.\n\n===Retired numbers===\n{|\n|style=\"text-align:right;

It has produced Dutch internationals such as [[Roy Makaay]], [[Marco van Ginkel]], [[Theo Janssen]], [[Ricky van Wolfswinkel]], [[Davy Pr\u00f6pper]], [[Piet Velthuizen]], [[Martin Laamers]], [[Nicky Hofs]] and [[Stijn Schaars]]. Since 1984, more than 40 successful players have risen through the Vitesse youth system and joined their first team, including: [[Alexander B\u00fcttner]], [[Kevin Diks]], [[Matthew Amoah]], [[Peter Bosz]], [[Onur Kaya]], [[Erwin Mulder]], [[Eloy Room]], [[Adnane Tighadouini]], [[Theo Bos (footballer)|Theo Bos]] and [[Riga Mustapha]].\n\nThe academy was officially founded in 2005, when the youth academies of Vitesse and [[AGOVV Apeldoorn]] merged. The newly formed academy received the official regional youth academy status from the [[Royal Dutch Football Association|KNVB]] and was based on the structure of the former Vitesse youth academy, with the addition of various AGOVV youth players and staff members. The co-operation between Vitesse and AGOVV was terminated as of July 2013, where the academy continued solely as Vitesse's youth academy. The goal of the Vitesse Voetbal Academy is to develop young players into professional football players for Vitesse's first team squad.\n\nThe academy comprises age-group teams ranging from U8's up to the flagship U19's. The youngest players are scouted at amateur clubs in the direct surroundings of [[Arnhem]]. For the age of twelve and older the academy extends its scouting area, mainly to the remaining part of the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]]. Until the U12 team, the players only have training sessions during the evening and are largely guided by part-time coaches.

He was one of the founders of Vitesse in 1892 at age 14. In 1905 he started in the first ever home match of the Netherlands national football team, a 4\u20130 victory against Belgium. Some historians attribute one of the goals scored to him. [[Just G\u00f6bel]] played 22 matches for the Dutch team, being best remembered for his numerous saves during the 2\u20131 win over England's amateurs and his bronze medal in the football tournament of the [[1912 Summer Olympics]]. The record number of Vitesse players for the Netherlands was three, which occurred on two occasions in 1989.

Established on 14 May 1892, Vitesse is one of the oldest professional football clubs in the [[Eredivisie]]. Since 1998, the club has played its home games at the [[GelreDome]]. \n\nVitesse had its most successful period in the 1990s. Their best result in the Eredivisie was third place in 1997\u201398. They won the [[KNVB Cup]] in [[2016\u201317 KNVB Cup|2017]] and also reached the final in 1912, 1927 and 1990. Throughout the years, Vitesse established itself as a stepping stone for future world class players like [[Raimond van der Gouw]], [[Philip Cocu]], [[Roy Makaay]], [[Sander Westerveld]], [[Nikos Machlas]], [[Pierre van Hooijdonk]], [[Mahamadou Diarra]], [[Nemanja Mati\u0107]], [[Marco van Ginkel]], [[Davy Pr\u00f6pper]], [[Wilfried Bony]], [[Mason Mount]] and [[Martin \u00d8degaard]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Vitesse kampioen van Oosten 1896.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Vitesse's first squad in 1896.]]\n[[Image:Vitesse 1913.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Vitesse's first squad in 1913.]]\n[[Image:Vitesse tegen Ajax 1-3 in KNVB-beker.

The roots of Vitesse actually pre-dated Sparta by a year as in 1887, a club with the name \"Arnhemsche cricket- en voetbalvereeniging Vitesse\" was formed by a group of high school students who played their sport on the Rijnkade, overlooking the River [[Rhine]] in the city centre. Reluctant to choose a Latin or English name for the club as they felt those languages were too elitist, they picked the French word ''Vitesse'', meaning \"speed\".\n\nIn 1891 the club disbanded as they were no longer able to find anywhere suitable to play cricket after a Velodrome was built on their usual playing field in the Klarenbeek Park. The following year a group of wealthy students resurrected the sports club, this time with the name '''AVC''' (Arnhemse Voetbal en Cricketclub) Vitesse. In the summer they played cricket and in the winter football. In the end of 1892, Vitesse played its first real football match, and in 1894 Vitesse disbanded the cricket branch. In 1895 and 1896 Vitesse became champions of the Gelderland competition. From the foundation of the Dutch national football championship in 1898 until 1954, the title was decided through play-offs by a handful of clubs who had previously won their regional league. Vitesse lost the final of the [[Eredivisie|national championship]] six times ''(1898, 1899, 1903, 1913, 1914 and 1915)''.\n\nIn 1912, Vitesse reached the final of the Dutch Cup Tournament for the first time. Vitesse lost the final with 0\u20132 from [[HFC Haarlem]]. In this period Vitesse had top players, likes [[Willem Hesselink]] and [[Just G\u00f6bel]]. This players were also active in the Dutch national team. In 1914 John William Sutcliffe became the first foreign trainer.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Vitesse didn't play-official matches because playing football in the open air was forbidden. During the [[Battle of Arnhem]], the residents of the city were forcibly evicted from their homes, allowing the Germans to turn the north bank of the Rhine into a heavily defended line. Residents were not allowed to return home without a permit and most did not return until after the war. The football field and clubhouse was completely destroyed. The damage was repaired in the years after the liberation.\n\nIn 1984 it was decided to divide the professional and amateur sections of the club. The professional section was renamed '''SBV''' (Stichting Betaald Voetbal \u2013 \"Professional Football Foundation\") Vitesse whilst the amateur section became \"Vitesse 1892\", which lasted until they disbanded in 2009.\n\nFrom 1984, [[Karel Aalbers]] was the president of SBV Vitesse. Aalbers' goal was to bring Vitesse from the bottom of the Second League (Eerste divisie, now [[Eerste Divisie|Jupiler League]]), the league in which the club originated, to the top 40 soccer clubs of Europe. He developed the basic idea for the '[[Gelredome]]', a stadium with a sliding pitch that can be moved out of the building. Later, the same system was applied in [[Gelsenkirchen]] ([[Schalke 04]]) and in [[Japan]]. Events such as pop concerts can be held without damaging the grass. Gelredome opened in 1998. It has a roof that can be opened and closed. It is fully climate controlled as well. In the first season after the opening, Gelredome's attendance rose to 20,000, (from less than 8,000 in the old stadium).\n\nVitesse made their debut in European competition in 1990. The club won their first match in the first round 1\u20130 over [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]].\n\nThe club remained financially sound through making notable profits on the transfer market. Players such as [[Roy Makaay]], [[Sander Westerveld]], [[Nikos Machlas]], [[Glenn Helder]] and [[Phillip Cocu|Philip Cocu]] were sold for large sums of money. Others came to occupy empty player positions, such as [[Mahamadou Diarra]] and [[Pierre van Hooijdonk]]. Vitesse finished in top 4 positions, made profits and showed a solid balance sheet in the final years of Aalbers' presidency. Also, the club became regular competitors in the UEFA Cup and in 1997\u20131998 finished third in the Eredivise, its record highest finish to date.\n\n[[Herbert Neumann]] was Vitesse's manager over most of these years (1992\u201395 and 1998\u201399), while star players included: Nikos Machlas, the first ever Vitesse player to win the European Golden Boot in 1998 when he scored 34 goals in a season; [[John van den Brom]], who played 378 matches for Vitesse during this period scoring 110 goals from midfield; and [[Edward Sturing]], who played 383 matches in defence for Vitesse from 1987 to 1998, as well as receiving 3 caps for the Netherlands national team. Additional stars included [[Dejan \u010curovi\u0107]], who spent six years at Vitesse playing 109 matches as a striker, scoring 41 goals including the first goal in GelreDome. Meanwhile, Dutch forward Roy Makaay spent four years at Vitesse, scoring 42 goals in 109 matches between 1993 and 1997.\n\nAalbers resigned on 15 February 2000,<ref>{{cite news | last = Ritsema | first = Andr\u00e9 | title = Aalbers moet bij Vitesse weg als voorzitter | work = [[NRC Handelsblad]] | language = Dutch | date = 16 February 2000 | url = http://www.nrc.nl/W2/Nieuws/2000/02/16/Spo/01.html | accessdate = 21 September 2008}}</ref> after the main sponsor, Nuon, threatened to pull the plug if he did not. Nuon, as a public utility company owned by local authorities, had trouble explaining why it invested heavily in Aalbers' ambitious plans. His successor was Jan Koning (former chief of Sara Lee/DE who resigned after four months). In a short period of time, Vitesse began to show negative financial results due to poor deals on the transfer market. The club survived numerous financial crises, such as the last one in 2008, when debts were bought off, under the threat of bankruptcy.\n\nThe club was in serious financial trouble, and in August 2010 its majority shareholder agreed to sell the club to the Georgian businessman [[Merab Jordania]]. There was rumors that this purchase was engineered by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] owner Roman Abramovich. The club underwent a successful transformation into a modern, commercial sports organization and established itself as one of the dominant teams of the Eredivisie.\n\nOn 1 July 2012, [[Fred Rutten]] signed a contract as the new manager of Vitesse, for the season [[2012\u201313 Eredivisie|2012-13]]. Rutten left Vitesse after the season, finishing in 4th place. [[Wilfried Bony]] ended the season as the [[Eredivisie#Top scorers|Eredivisie's top scorer]] with 31 goals in 30 matches and was awarded the [[Dutch Footballer of the Year|Golden Shoe]] for the best player in the Netherlands.\n\nFor the 2013\u201314 season, Vitesse appointed [[Peter Bosz]] as its new manager. In November 2013, Vitesse was top of the league in the Eredivisie for the first time since 2006. It was the first time since 2000 they'd been top of the league later than the first week. Halfway through the season, after 17 matches, Vitesse was the leader in the competition. Key players in the squad from this period included [[Davy Pr\u00f6pper]], [[Christian Atsu]] and [[Bertrand Traor\u00e9]].\n\nVitesse announced on 13 June 2016 that [[Henk Fraser]] would replace Bosz at the start of the [[2016\u201317 Eredivisie|2016\u201317]] season. In his first full season, won the club first major trophy in its 125-year existence.

In the [[2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League]] group stage, Vitesse's opponents were [[Lazio Roma]], [[OGC Nice]] and [[Zulte Waregem]]. Vitesse ultimately finished the group stage in fourth place. In October 2017, [[Guram Kashia]] wore a rainbow-striped captain's armband for Vitesse against Heracles Almelo in support of [[LGBT]] rights, leading to a backlash in his own country. In August 2018, he became the inaugural recipient of UEFA's #EqualGame award for his act.<ref>{{cite news |title=Guram Kashia: Georgia captain becomes first recipient of Uefa #EqualGame award |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45274881 |accessdate=23 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2018, it was announced that [[Leonid Slutsky (football coach)|Leonid Slutsky]] would replace Henk Fraser as the new manager of Vitesse, for the start of the 2018&ndash;19 season. Under his tenure, Vitesse entered the draw for the third qualifying round of the Europa League, being drawn against seeded [[FC Basel]]. Vitesse lost 2\u20130 on aggregate, resulting in their elimination from the Europa League. At the domestic level, Vitesse finished fifth in the Eredivisie from that season. Missing out on Europe was a blow for Vitesse and Slutsky will be hoping his team can challenge for a top three spot next season. After five lost games in a row, he decided to quit with his job as manager from Vitesse at the end of November 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/l/2312612|title=Sloetski stapt op als trainer van Vitesse|work=nos.nl|accessdate=29 November 2019|language=nl}}</ref> On 30 December 2019, Vitesse appointed Edward Sturing yet again as their manager.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[Image:GelreDome 4.png|thumb|GelreDome with closed roof and pitch outside.]]\n[[Image:Gelredome Binnenkant.jpg|GelreDome Stadium|thumb]]\n[[Image:Stadium_locations_Vitesse_Arnhem.jpg|Locations|thumb]]\n\n===Stadium===\n{{main|GelreDome}}\nThe GelreDome is the home stadium of Vitesse, one of the largest stadiums in the Netherlands. The stadium has a retractable roof and a convertible pitch that can be retracted when unused during concerts or other events held at the stadium. GelreDome has the reputation of being one of the most family-friendly football stadiums in the country.\n\nIn 1998, the GelreDome replaced the [[Nieuw Monnikenhuize]]. The stadium was able to hold 12,000 people in a mix of seats and standing, however with the addition of temporary bleachers it could be raised to 18,000. After the increasing popularity of Vitesse in the 1990s, it became obvious that the traditional ground was too small for the increasing number of Vitesse supporters. The much-loved Nieuw Monnikenhuize Stadion was torn down and the land was sold to the city council. A residential neighbourhood now occupies the area.\n\nThe GelreDome currently holds a four-star rating by [[UEFA]]. Three international matches of the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national football team]] were played in the stadium, the first one being on 27 May 1998: a friendly against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] (0\u20131). The last one, played on 26 April 2000, was also a friendly: a 0\u20130 against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. Furthermore, the GelreDome was the location for three [[UEFA Euro 2000]] group stage matches, as well as the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] tournament. Aside from football-related purposes, the ground is occasionally used for music concerts\n\nThe stadium has a maximum capacity of 21,000 people for sports events, or 41,000 during concerts. The GelreDome pitch is surrounded on each side by four covered all-seater stands, officially known as the [[Edward Sturing|Edward Sturing Stand (North)]], [[Henk Bosveld|Charly Bosveld Stand (East)]], [[Theo Bos (footballer)|Theo Bos Stand (South)]] and [[Just G\u00f6bel|Just G\u00f6bel Stand (West)]]. The stadium is near a highway interchange and only a few minutes' drive from the main railway station in Arnhem. Furthermore, there is a bus stop near GelreDome.\n\n====Stadium history====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#0D4C92; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"| Name !! style=\"background:#0D4C92; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"| Location !! style=\"background:#0D4C92; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"| Years \n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Rijnkade / Klarenbeek Park\n|[[Arnhem]]-Centrum / Klarenbeek, Arnhem-North\n|1887\u20131891\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Molenbeekstraat\n|Molenbeke, Arnhem-North\n|1892\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|IJsclub Boulevard Heuvelink\n|Spijkerkwartier, Arnhem-North\n|1892\u20131894\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Bronbeek|Bronbeek Royal Palace]]\n|Paasberg, Arnhem-North\n|1893\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Paasweide\n|De Preats, Arnhem-South\n|1894\u20131896\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Klarenbeek Stadium\n|Klarenbeek, Arnhem-North\n|1896\u20131915\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Monnikenhuize]]\n|Monnikenhuize, Arnhem-North\n|1915\u20131950\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Nieuw Monnikenhuize]]\n|Monnikenhuize, Arnhem-North\n|1950\u20131997\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[GelreDome]]\n|Malburgen, Arnhem-South\n|1998\u2013present\n|-\n|}\n\n===Training ground===\nTraining sessions by Vitesse are conducted at [[National Sports Centre Papendal|Papendal]], located in the outskirts of Arnhem in woodland surroundings. Papendal is also the home base of [[NOC*NSF]]. Vitesse moved to Papendal in 1998. With the opening of the GelreDome, the old training facility was closed down. The new training facilities at Papendal were completed in 2013. The complex has been inspired by [[Cobham Training Centre]]. Even though the Papendal complex is of a more modest format, it has many similar facilities, such as a weight training room, a state-of-the-art therapy bath, a steam room, sports medical rooms, a press reception area and separate restaurants for visitors and players.\n\nOn the grounds, there are 6 full size football pitches of which one is astro turf. A stand has been built at the Academy's main pitch, with a capacity of over 500 people. The reserve squad and academy teams all play their matches here. The complex is situated in large wooded area, where the players can prepare in a peaceful and private environment, whilst not being too far from the hustle and bustle of Arnhem's city centre.\n\nBesides having the most advanced and up-to-date sports and training complexes, Papendal is also the base for administration staff, scouting department and all club coaches. There are eleven dressing rooms, physiotherapy suites and a base for the medical staff, including a consulting room.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Entree Papendal.png|Entrance to Papendal\nFile:Accommodatie Vitesse Papendal.png|Training accommodation at Papendal\nFile:Hoofdveld Vitesse Papendal.jpg|Main football field of Vitesse, where the youth plays their competitions\nFile:20190307 Netherlands, Arnhem, Vitesse, onderwaterloopband (46) - small size Wetransfer.jpg|Therapy bath\nFile:Vooraanzicht Hotel Papendal.jpg|Hotel Papendal\n</gallery>\n\n==Symbols==\n[[File:Hertog.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Vitesse's crest is composed of an eagle.]]\n[[File:Theo Bos.jpg|right|thumb|150px|''Mister Vitesse'' [[Theo Bos (footballer)|Theo Bos]]]]\n\n===Hertog===\nVitesse are well known for the [[Bald eagle|American bald Eagle]] 'Hertog', which is released before the match and flies over the crowds.\n\n===Colours===\nOriginally, Vitesse played in white shirts with a blue sash from inception until 1900, paying hommage to the city\u2019s colours. At the turn of the century, player Reinhard Jan Christiaan baron van Pallandt offered to sponsor the club\u2019s shirts in exchange for Vitesse switching to his family colours of black and yellow. The board were quick to accept, noting that Vitesse, being one of the strongest team in the province of Gelderland, would be vindicated in playing in what could also be considered the province\u2019s colours (the [[flag of Gelderland]] is a tricolour in blue, yellow, and black).\n\n===Anthems===\nVitesse fans are known to be creative and have various songs and chants during matches. Among the most important Vitesse songs are \"Geel en Zwart zijn onze kleuren\" by Emile Hartkamp, and \"Bouw mee aan een steengoed Vites!\" by Henk Bleker & Enka Harmonie. Vitesse opens its home matches with \"Whatever You Want\" by [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], and after every home goal \"[[Bro Hymn]]\" by [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]] is played.\n\n===Mr Vitesse===\n[[Theo Bos (footballer)|Theo Bos]] was raised in [[Arnhem]] and started playing football from an early age. He began his career at amateur club Sv Sempre Avanti and played from 1979-1983 in the academy of Vitesse. Manager [[Leen Looijen]] gave him his professional debut on 13 August 1983 against [[FC Wageningen]]; the match ended in a 3\u20130 victory for Vitesse. Bos spent his entire playing career for Vitesse, making a total 369 appearances in 14 seasons with his club. After his playing career, Bos worked at Vitesse as youth coach, assistant coach and manager. He is therefore considered to be ''Mister Vitesse''. In 2012, the south stand of the [[GelreDome]] stadium was named the Theo Bos Stand. Bos died on 28 February 2013 of [[pancreatic cancer]], aged forty-seven. Following his death, a special remembrance to honour Theo Bos took place at Gelredome with around 7,000 Vitesse supporters. As of the 2012\u201313 season, no player could wear the number 4 shirt at Vitesse after the club decided to retire the shirt out of respect for Theo Bos, \"the legendary number four\". Dutch defender [[Jan-Arie van der Heijden]] was the last player to wear the number. In November 2013, his biography ''Het is zoals het is'' ('It is what it is') was published, written by journalist Marcel van Roosmalen. In 2015, a statue of Bos was erected outside of the training complex at [[National Sports Centre Papendal|Papendal]].\n\n====Other club legends====\nBelow is a list with members who have established themselves as club legends: \n{{col-begin-small}}\n{{col-3}}\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Willem Hesselink]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Just G\u00f6bel]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Frans de Munck]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Henk Bosveld]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Karel Aalbers]] \n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Bert Jacobs]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Edward Sturing]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Frans Thijssen]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[John van den Brom]] \n{{col-3}}\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Martin Laamers]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Raimond van der Gouw]] \n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Ben Hofs]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Nicky Hofs]] \n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Ricky van Wolfswinkel]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Theo Janssen]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Marc van Hintum]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Herman Veenendaal]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Gerrit Horsten]]\n{{col-3}}\n*{{flagicon|Bosnia and Herzegovina}} [[Bo\u0161ko Bursa\u0107]]\n*{{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Dejan \u010curovi\u0107]] \n*{{flagicon|Greece}} [[Nikos Machlas]] \n*{{flagicon|Georgia}} [[Guram Kashia]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} Cor Guijt\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} Jan Snellenburg\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} Martin Esveld\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} Jan Dommering \n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} Dik Herberts\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Airborne-match===\n[[Image:Airborne_match_Vitesse_Arnhem.jpg|right|thumb|The 'Airborne memorial' football match]]\nAround September there is an annual 'Airborne memorial' football match. During this annual Airborne-match the veterans of [[World War II]] will be honored. The Gelredome is decorated with Airborne flags, both outside and inside the stadium, and at halftime, 120 members of the Royal British Legion played the bagpipes with some other musical guests. Clubsymbol Hertog fly with the typical Airborne colors. The match is traditionally visited by veterans who were fighting in this battle, while a special shirt is worn by Vitesse. The club drop their normal striped black and yellow kit for this special match. Instead they wear claret and blue outfits, the same colours of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]], with a 1st Airborne 'winged horse' emblem also etched on the kit. Pictured on the collar sticker is the [[John Frost Bridge]]. These shirts are after the match auctioned for charity. In addition, Vitesse wearing a special captain's armband as a sign of recognition and respect for those who have fought for our freedom.\n\nIn the 2014\u201315 and 2019\u201320 seasons, Vitesse played their away games in the same colours of the 1st Airborne Division.\n\nIn 2012, Peters was at the Gelredome watching Vitesse, and after the Airborne match, captain [[Guram Kashia]] went over to veteran to express his thanks for coming to the match, gave him his shirt (which Peters donated to the [[Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum|Airborne Assault Museum]] in [[Cambridge]]), stood at what we'll loosely call attention, and saluted Peters. When asked about it, Kashia simply said \"I want to show them respect, they are heroes.\" A year later, on the match commemorating, the Vitesse supporters unveiled a banner capturing the moment between Peters and Kashia. Johnny Peters died on 8 August 2014 after a short illness.\n\n''Veteranen van Vitesse'' is a television documentary on [[Fox Sports (Netherlands)|FOX Sports]]. It premiered on 24 November 2014.\n\n===Crest===\nThe first logo of Vitesse was a shield-shaped crest. In the middle there was a diagonal dividing line between the left yellow face and the right black box. In the left box, \"AVC Vitesse\" was diagonally written and in the right-hand side, \"1892 \", the club's founding year. The old logo was replaced in 1984, the year in which the roads of the BVO branch and the amateur branch separated. The amateur branch retained the logo with limited modification, SBV Vitesse got a new logo.\n\nThe new logo of the BVO from 1984 is once again a shield-shaped figure, but it has straight lines at both the top and sides of the logo. At the top is with thick white uppercase Vitesse. Under the name is a double-headed eagle, with left and right half mirrored. Also the colors are mirrored, which is left yellow is black right and vice versa. This double-headed eagle can also be found in the coat of arms of Arnhem. In the middle of the logo is a football positioned.\n\nIn the autumn of 2011, a new version of the logo was put into use; A total of 13 changes have been made. For example, the symmetry of the eagle was improved, the black outer edge replaced by a white and in the writing has been made thinner. The football has been altered in terms of appearance as a shadow effect is added and (if the context allows it) the year of creation as text EST. 1892 under the logo can be found.\n\nThere was also a special anniversary crest to celebrate the 125th (2017) anniversary of the club.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vitesse Logo jaren 70 1.png|The first Vitesse crest\nFile:Vitesse Logo jaren 70 2.png|The second crest\nFile:Vitesse logo.svg|The third crest\nFile:SBV Vitesse logo.svg|2011\u2013present \n</gallery>\n\n===Kit===\nVitesse wore sponsored shirts for the first time in the [[1982\u201383 Eredivisie|1982\u201383 season]], to promote the [[Akai]]. The club signed its first kit manufacturing deal with the German firm [[adidas]]. The kit is being produced by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] for the 2019\u201320 season.\n{{col-begin-small}}\n{{col-4}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\"\n! Years !!

club are known as ''Vitessenaren''. Vitesse has two independent fan bodies. The ''Supportersvereniging Vitesse'' was founded in 1992 and currently consists of 3,000 members. They own a fan base within the GelreDome. The second one, ''Arnhem Ultras'', serve a more specific purpose: to improve the atmosphere in the stadium. Besides the fan unions, there are several sets of fans who work together on tifo choreography, likes ''VIVO (Vitesse Is van Ons)'', ''De Aftrap'' and ''VAK 113'' among others. Nowadays, Vitesse is supported by one fanatic side: The ''Theo Bos \u2013 South Stand''. This stand is responsible for a big part of the atmosphere in the stadium.\n\nVitesse have attracted around 18,000 people to Eredivisie matches on average in the last years. The record attendance stands at 26,600, achieved in a match against [[NAC Breda]] at 25 March 1998. Research showed that about 10,000 season ticket holders from [[Gelderland]], with other significant groups coming from [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], [[South Holland]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n\nThe ''Vitesse Kids Club'' was founded by Vitesse in 1998 for children up to 16 years. Every year, the ''Vitesse Kids Club Day'' is organized, offering activities for members who are joined by the first team squad. During pre-season, Vitesse also holds an Open Day for people of all ages; the event gives the opportunity for sponsors and new player signings to be presented.\n\nVitesse fans have established a close friendship with the supporters of [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]] and [[RFC de Li\u00e8ge]]. Back in the days they had a friendship with [[Lierse SK]] till there was a big riot between them at a friendly match in 2011.\n\n==Rivalries==\n===Rivalry with N.E.C.===\n[[N.E.C. (football club)|NEC]] from [[Nijmegen]] are Vitesse's archrivals. The two clubs share a long history together and matches between the two clubs are called the Gelderse Derby ''(Derby of Gelderland)''. The rivalry between these two clubs goes beyond the football rivalry, it transcends into the city rivalry between the two largest cities of [[Gelderland]]: Nijmegen and [[Arnhem]]. This city rivalry began when these two cities first received their city rights. The two cities are just 20 kilometres apart, leading to an intense feeling of a cross-town rivalry, heightened by a feeling that local pride is at stake. The meeting between the two teams is still considered to be one of the biggest matches of the season.\n\nThe inhabitants of these cities differ extremely in both attitudes and cultures which is clearly reflected on to the football pitch. Vitesse's style of play has long been a source of pride for the supporters, and one of irritation for the NEC fans.\n\nSince 1813, Arnhem has been the capital of Gelderland, historically based on finance and trade. Arnhem is perceived as an office city with modern buildings. Nijmegen, on the other hand, is predominantly a workers' city, with middle and high-income groups in the minority. People from Nijmegen see Arnhem as arrogant and lazy.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! \n! Played\n! Vitesse wins\n! Draws\n! N.E.C. wins\n! Vitesse goals\n!

Nijmegen. The rivalry has existed for some time with De Graafschap and stems from various causes, such as the opposition between the large city (Arnhem) and the countryside ([[Doetinchem]]).\n\nFurther teams who share a rivalry with Vitesse include [[FC Twente]] and [[AFC Ajax]]. Past rivalries include local derbies between Vitesse and clubs such as [[FC Wageningen]], [[Go Ahead Eagles]], [[Quick 1888]], Arnhemse Boys and VV Rheden. However, the tension between the local sides lessened as the division of the clubs through playing in different leagues over time became greater. Years of not competing in the same league resulted in less frequent match-ups, until tensions finally settled between the local clubs.\n\n==Players==\n===Current squad===\n{{updated|3 February 2020}}<ref>http://www.vitesse.nl/en/first-team/selection</ref>\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=1 |nat= GRE |name=[[Kostas Lamprou]]|pos=GK|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=2 |nat= NED |name=[[Julian Lelieveld]]|pos=DF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=3 |nat= NED |name=[[Armando Obispo]]|pos=DF|Name=|other=<small>on loan from [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]]</small>}} \n{{Fs player|no=5 |nat= ENG |name=[[Max Clark (footballer)|Max Clark]]|pos=DF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=7 |nat= NED |pos=FW|name=[[Jay-Roy Grot]]|other=<small>on loan from [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=8 |nat= NOR |name=[[Sondre Tronstad]]|pos=MF|Name=}}\n{{Fs player|no=9 |nat= SLO |name=[[Tim Matav\u017e]]|pos=FW|other=<small>[[Captain (association football)|vice captain]]</small>}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat= NED |name=[[Riechedly Bazoer]]|pos=MF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat= NED |name=[[Bryan Linssen]]|pos=MF|other=<small>[[Captain (association football)|captain]]</small>}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat= MAR |name=[[Oussama Tannane]]|pos=MF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat= NOR |name=[[Filip Delaveris]]|pos=FW|Name=}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat= NED |name=[[Roy Beerens]]|pos=FW|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat= ISR |name=[[Eli Dasa]]|pos=DF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat= CZE |name=[[Tom\u00e1\u0161 H\u00e1jek]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat= NGA |name=[[Hilary Gong]]|pos=FW|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat= MLI |name=[[Nouha Dicko]]|pos=FW|Name=|other=<small>on loan from [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]</small>}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat= SVK |name=[[Mat\u00fa\u0161 Bero]]|pos=MF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat= NED |name=[[Remko Pasveer]]|pos=GK|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat= BEL |name=[[Charly Musonda (footballer, born 1996)|Charly Musonda]]|pos=FW|Name=|other=<small>on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]</small>}}\n{{Fs player|no=28|nat= NED |name=[[Joshua Brenet]]|pos=DF|Name=|other=<small>on loan from [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|1899 Hoffenheim]]</small>}} \n{{Fs player|no=29|nat= NED |name=[[Thomas Buitink]]|pos=FW|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=30|nat= NED |name=[[Danilho Doekhi]]|pos=DF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=32|nat= NED |name=\u00d6zg\u00fcr Aktas|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=36|nat= NED |name=[[Patrick Vroegh]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=37|nat= NED |name=[[Yassin Oukili]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=38|nat= NED |name=Richie Musaba|pos=MF|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=40|nat= NED |name=Bilal Bayazit|pos=GK|Name=|other=}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n''For recent transfers, see [[2019\u201320 SBV Vitesse season]].''\n\n===Players out on loan===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= NED |name=[[Jeroen Houwen]]|pos=GK|Name=|other=<small>on loan at [[Go Ahead Eagles]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= NED |name=[[Khalid Karami]]|pos=DF|Name=|other=<small>on loan at [[Sparta Rotterdam]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= NED |name=[[Thomas Bruns]]|pos=MF|Name=|other=<small>on loan at [[VVV-Venlo]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= ALG |name=[[Oussama Darfalou]]|pos=FW|Name=|other=<small>on loan at [[VVV-Venlo]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Reserve team (Under-21)===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=2|nat= NED |name=Brend Leeflang|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=3|nat= NED |name=\u00d6zg\u00fcr Aktas|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|nat= NED |name=Younes Zakir|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=5|nat= NED |name=Aaron Sieders|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=6|nat= NED |name=[[Yassin Oukili]]|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=7|nat= NED |name=[[Lars ten Teije]]|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat= NED |name=[[Patrick Vroegh]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat= NED |name=Roy Kuijpers|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat= NED |name=Joey Kesting|pos=GK|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat= NED |name=Paul Fosu Mensah|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat= NED |name=Aness Serghini|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat= SER |name=Nikolas Agrafiotis|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=-|nat= NED |name=Danny M\u00fchl|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=-|nat= NED |name=Jasper Dahlhaus|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Youth teams===\nThe club also have 10 further youth teams: Under-19, Under-17, Under-16, Under-15, Under-14, Under-13, Under-12, Under-11, Under-10 and Under-9.\n\n===Retired numbers===\n{|\n|style=\"text-align:right;

It has produced Dutch internationals such as [[Roy Makaay]], [[Marco van Ginkel]], [[Theo Janssen]], [[Ricky van Wolfswinkel]], [[Davy Pr\u00f6pper]], [[Piet Velthuizen]], [[Martin Laamers]], [[Nicky Hofs]] and [[Stijn Schaars]]. Since 1984, more than 40 successful players have risen through the Vitesse youth system and joined their first team, including: [[Alexander B\u00fcttner]], [[Kevin Diks]], [[Matthew Amoah]], [[Peter Bosz]], [[Onur Kaya]], [[Erwin Mulder]], [[Eloy Room]], [[Adnane Tighadouini]], [[Theo Bos (footballer)|Theo Bos]] and [[Riga Mustapha]].\n\nThe academy was officially founded in 2005, when the youth academies of Vitesse and [[AGOVV Apeldoorn]] merged. The newly formed academy received the official regional youth academy status from the [[Royal Dutch Football Association|KNVB]] and was based on the structure of the former Vitesse youth academy, with the addition of various AGOVV youth players and staff members. The co-operation between Vitesse and AGOVV was terminated as of July 2013, where the academy continued solely as Vitesse's youth academy. The goal of the Vitesse Voetbal Academy is to develop young players into professional football players for Vitesse's first team squad.\n\nThe academy comprises age-group teams ranging from U8's up to the flagship U19's. The youngest players are scouted at amateur clubs in the direct surroundings of [[Arnhem]]. For the age of twelve and older the academy extends its scouting area, mainly to the remaining part of the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]]. Until the U12 team, the players only have training sessions during the evening and are largely guided by part-time coaches.

He was one of the founders of Vitesse in 1892 at age 14. In 1905 he started in the first ever home match of the Netherlands national football team, a 4\u20130 victory against Belgium. Some historians attribute one of the goals scored to him. [[Just G\u00f6bel]] played 22 matches for the Dutch team, being best remembered for his numerous saves during the 2\u20131 win over England's amateurs and his bronze medal in the football tournament of the [[1912 Summer Olympics]]. The record number of Vitesse players for the Netherlands was three, which occurred on two occasions in 1989.

When icing occurs, a linesman stops play. Play is resumed with a faceoff in the defending zone of the team that committed the infraction. In the NHL and many professional leagues, icing can be negated if a player from the team committing the icing touches the puck before a defender, in which case play continues (the linesman nearest the puck will indicate this with a \"washout\" signal). In many amateur leagues, the '''no-touch''' icing rule is used, meaning play stops as soon as the puck crosses the goal line. The NHL adopted a rule where the team that committed the infraction is unable to make a line change during the stoppage to discourage teams from icing the puck to \"get a whistle\" and change lines; this change has been adopted by many pro and high-level amateur leagues, but not all.\n; [[Ice resurfacer|Ice Resurfacer]] : A vehicle that reconditions ice before play and between periods of a game to smooth out and clean the ice for optimal glide of both puck and skate.

The two defencemen, a forward, and the goaltender align themselves in a diamond shape so that imaginary lines drawn through the two defencemen and through the forward and goaltender form the shape of a cross. This is usually a highly defensive strategy, designed to kill off a penalty as safely as possible.\n\n==J==\n; [[Jill (hockey)|Jill]] : A jill is a simple device used to protect the pelvic area of a female ice hockey player.\n; [[Jock (hockey)|Jock]] : A jock is a simple device used to protect the testicles of a male ice hockey player.\n\n==K==\n; Kicking : (i) The act of propelling the puck using the skates.

In the most basic form, once puck possession changes, the left wing moves back in line with the defensemen. Each defender (including the left winger) play a zone defense and are responsible for a third of the ice each. Since there are normally only two defensemen, this tactic helps to avoid odd man rushes.\n; Light the Lamp : To score a goal.

In the NHL and many professional leagues, icing can be negated if a player from the team committing the icing touches the puck before a defender, in which case play continues (the linesman nearest the puck will indicate this with a \"washout\" signal). In many amateur leagues, the '''no-touch''' icing rule is used, meaning play stops as soon as the puck crosses the goal line. The NHL adopted a rule where the team that committed the infraction is unable to make a line change during the stoppage to discourage teams from icing the puck to \"get a whistle\" and change lines; this change has been adopted by many pro and high-level amateur leagues, but not all.\n; [[Ice resurfacer|Ice Resurfacer]] : A vehicle that reconditions ice before play and between periods of a game to smooth out and clean the ice for optimal glide of both puck and skate.

PFOA is considered a surfactant, or fluorosurfactant, due to its chemical structure consisting of a perfluorinated, ''n''-octyl \"tail group\" and a [[carboxylate]] \"head group\". The head group can be described as [[hydrophilic]] while the [[fluorocarbon]] tail is both [[hydrophobic]] and [[lipophobic]]. The tail group is inert and does not interact strongly with polar or non-polar chemical [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]]; the head group is reactive and interacts strongly with polar groups, specifically water. The \"tail\" is hydrophobic due to being [[non-polar]] and lipophobic because fluorocarbons are less susceptible to the [[London dispersion force]] than [[hydrocarbon]]s.<ref name=\"Lemal2004\">{{cite journal|author=Lemal DM|date=January 2004|title=Perspective on fluorocarbon chemistry|journal=J.

PFOA serves as a surfactant in the [[emulsion polymerization]] of [[fluoropolymers]] and as a building block for the synthesis of perfluoroalkyl-substituted compounds, polymers, and polymeric materials.  PFOA has been manufactured since the 1940s in industrial quantities.<ref name=\"Lindstrom\">{{cite journal |last1=Lindstrom |first1=Andrew B. |last2=Strynar |first2=Mark J. |last3=Libelo |first3=E.

A positive exposure-response trend for kidney cancer is supported by many studies. PFOA has been detected in the blood of more than 98% of the general US population in the low and sub-[[parts per billion]] (ppb) range, and levels are higher in chemical plant employees and surrounding subpopulations. How general populations are exposed to PFOA is not completely understood. PFOA has been detected in industrial waste, stain-resistant carpets, carpet-cleaning liquids, [[house dust]], [[Popcorn bag|microwave popcorn bags]], water, food, and Teflon ([[PTFE]]) products.\n\nAs a result of a class-action lawsuit and community settlement with [[DuPont]], three [[Epidemiology|epidemiologists]] conducted studies on the population surrounding a chemical plant that was exposed to PFOA at levels greater than in the general population.

The study consisted of 32,254 residents with 2,507 reported cancer diagnoses occurring during study period. PFOA serum concentrations were measured at baseline and three to six year follow-up meetings. Retrospective yearly PFOA serum levels were estimated for each subject from 1952 through 2011.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Barry|first=Vaughn|last2=Winquist|first2=Andrea|last3=Steenland|first3=Kyle|date=November 2013|title=Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Exposures and Incident Cancers among Adults Living Near a Chemical Plant|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=121|issue=11\u201312|pages=1313\u20131318|doi=10.1289/ehp.1306615|issn=0091-6765|pmc=3855514|pmid=24007715}}</ref>\n\nInitial subject recruitment was performed using eligibility criteria and surveys\u2014subjects were eligible if they lived or worked in one of the six contaminated water districts for at least one year between 1950 and December 3, 2004. Follow-up surveys were administered and remaining subjects (completion of at least one survey) were then included in the analysis dataset\u2014selection bias was assessed and the final subjects did not differ significantly from the original population.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nRetrospective PFOA serum concentrations were calculated using the published method of Shin et al. 2011a, 2011b''').''' Historical regional data including emission rates by the DuPont facility, temporal patterns and groundwater flow are incorporated in the model as well as individual &nbsp;specific occupational exposure level was included. A job-exposure matrix was developed to assess estimated PFOA levels for workers across times and job roles.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIncident data was self-reported by study participants and followed up with a medical chart review. Cancer diagnoses were verified using Ohio/West Virginia cancer registries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA proportional hazards regression model was used for each cancer type with the cancer as the outcome and PFOA serum level included as a time-varying covariate. Participants were followed from age 20 (or age in 1952) to the age of cancer diagnosis. Models were adjusted for time-varying- smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as sex, education and 5-year birth cohort. The outcome of PFOA serum level was log-transformed due to the scarcity of very high cumulative exposure values.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nParticipants who worked at the DuPont facility had higher PFOA serum levels and higher estimated annual PFOA levels than subjects who never worked at the facility. After cancer diagnosis validation, thyroid, kidney and testicular cancer risk were found to increase with an increase in the PFOA serum concentration (log-transformed), with testicular cancer being significantly associated (\u03b1 =0.05). The results are consistent with previous mortality analyses performed using DuPont data. There is a positive exposure-response trend for cancer incidence and PFOA serum levels. Kidney and testicular cancer are of interest given that animal studies have found that PFOA is distributed mainly in the kidneys and because PFOA has been found to induce testicular tumors in rats.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n'''Impact of In Utero Exposure on Reproductive Organs'''\n\nDue to the fact that PFOA is able to readily pass through the placental barrier, exposure is of particular concern during in utero development.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Vested|first=Anne|last2=Ramlau-Hansen|first2=Cecilia H\u00f8st|last3=Olsen|first3=Sjurdur Frodi|last4=Bonde|first4=Jens Peter|last5=Kristensen|first5=Susanne Lund|last6=Halldorsson|first6=Thorhallur Ingi|last7=Becher|first7=Georg|last8=Haug|first8=Line Sm\u00e5stuen|last9=Ernst|first9=Emil Hagen|date=April 2013|title=Associations of in utero exposure to perfluorinated alkyl acids with human semen quality and reproductive hormones in adult men|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=121|issue=4|pages=453\u2013458|doi=10.1289/ehp.1205118|issn=1552-9924|pmc=3620740|pmid=23360585}}</ref> Numerous studies have analyzed the impacts of PFOA on fetal development of reproductive organs. One study that followed a Danish pregnancy cohort suggests that in utero exposure to PFOA could be associated with lower levels of sperm concentration and total sperm count in adult males, reduced testicular size, and higher adjusted levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone.<ref name=\":3\" /> In utero PFOA exposure is also demonstrated to impact female development. For example, a study following a Danish population-based cohort found a 5.3 month later age of menarche in girls exposed to higher levels of PFOA in utero. Delayed onset of menarche is associated with lower bone mineral density and may have psychosocial impacts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kristensen|first=S. L.|last2=Ramlau-Hansen|first2=C.

The study consisted of 32,254 residents with 2,507 reported cancer diagnoses occurring during study period. PFOA serum concentrations were measured at baseline and three to six year follow-up meetings. Retrospective yearly PFOA serum levels were estimated for each subject from 1952 through 2011.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Barry|first=Vaughn|last2=Winquist|first2=Andrea|last3=Steenland|first3=Kyle|date=November 2013|title=Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Exposures and Incident Cancers among Adults Living Near a Chemical Plant|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=121|issue=11\u201312|pages=1313\u20131318|doi=10.1289/ehp.1306615|issn=0091-6765|pmc=3855514|pmid=24007715}}</ref>\n\nInitial subject recruitment was performed using eligibility criteria and surveys\u2014subjects were eligible if they lived or worked in one of the six contaminated water districts for at least one year between 1950 and December 3, 2004. Follow-up surveys were administered and remaining subjects (completion of at least one survey) were then included in the analysis dataset\u2014selection bias was assessed and the final subjects did not differ significantly from the original population.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nRetrospective PFOA serum concentrations were calculated using the published method of Shin et al. 2011a, 2011b''').''' Historical regional data including emission rates by the DuPont facility, temporal patterns and groundwater flow are incorporated in the model as well as individual &nbsp;specific occupational exposure level was included. A job-exposure matrix was developed to assess estimated PFOA levels for workers across times and job roles.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIncident data was self-reported by study participants and followed up with a medical chart review. Cancer diagnoses were verified using Ohio/West Virginia cancer registries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA proportional hazards regression model was used for each cancer type with the cancer as the outcome and PFOA serum level included as a time-varying covariate. Participants were followed from age 20 (or age in 1952) to the age of cancer diagnosis. Models were adjusted for time-varying- smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as sex, education and 5-year birth cohort. The outcome of PFOA serum level was log-transformed due to the scarcity of very high cumulative exposure values.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nParticipants who worked at the DuPont facility had higher PFOA serum levels and higher estimated annual PFOA levels than subjects who never worked at the facility. After cancer diagnosis validation, thyroid, kidney and testicular cancer risk were found to increase with an increase in the PFOA serum concentration (log-transformed), with testicular cancer being significantly associated (\u03b1 =0.05). The results are consistent with previous mortality analyses performed using DuPont data. There is a positive exposure-response trend for cancer incidence and PFOA serum levels. Kidney and testicular cancer are of interest given that animal studies have found that PFOA is distributed mainly in the kidneys and because PFOA has been found to induce testicular tumors in rats.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n'''Impact of In Utero Exposure on Reproductive Organs'''\n\nDue to the fact that PFOA is able to readily pass through the placental barrier, exposure is of particular concern during in utero development.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Vested|first=Anne|last2=Ramlau-Hansen|first2=Cecilia H\u00f8st|last3=Olsen|first3=Sjurdur Frodi|last4=Bonde|first4=Jens Peter|last5=Kristensen|first5=Susanne Lund|last6=Halldorsson|first6=Thorhallur Ingi|last7=Becher|first7=Georg|last8=Haug|first8=Line Sm\u00e5stuen|last9=Ernst|first9=Emil Hagen|date=April 2013|title=Associations of in utero exposure to perfluorinated alkyl acids with human semen quality and reproductive hormones in adult men|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=121|issue=4|pages=453\u2013458|doi=10.1289/ehp.1205118|issn=1552-9924|pmc=3620740|pmid=23360585}}</ref> Numerous studies have analyzed the impacts of PFOA on fetal development of reproductive organs. One study that followed a Danish pregnancy cohort suggests that in utero exposure to PFOA could be associated with lower levels of sperm concentration and total sperm count in adult males, reduced testicular size, and higher adjusted levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone.<ref name=\":3\" /> In utero PFOA exposure is also demonstrated to impact female development. For example, a study following a Danish population-based cohort found a 5.3 month later age of menarche in girls exposed to higher levels of PFOA in utero.

His grievances against the governor stemmed from Berkeley's dismissive policy to the political challenges of its western frontier, particularly leaving Bacon out of his inner circle and refusing to allow Bacon to take part in fur trading with [[Native American tribes in Virginia|Native Americans]], and Berkeley refusing Bacon a military commission that would allow him to fight and attack Native Americans at his own discretion. Attacks by the [[Doeg people]] are credited with inciting the popular uprising against Berkeley for failing to address the demands of the colonists regarding the safety of the frontier. The Doeg people had both traded and made war on the Virginia frontier.\n\nStarting in the 1650s, as English colonists began to settle the Northern Neck frontier, then known as Chicacoan (Secocowon), some Doeg, Patawomeck and Rappahannock began moving into the region as well and joined local tribes in disputing the settlers' claims to land and resources. In July 1666, the colonists declared war on them. By 1669, colonists had patented the land on the west of the Potomac as far north as My Lord's Island. By 1670, they had driven most of the Doeg out of the Virginia colony and into Maryland\u2014apart from those living beside the Nanzatico/Portobago in Caroline County, Virginia.\n\nThe English continued to harass the Doeg on the Northern Neck and in July 1675, a Doeg raiding party crossed the Potomac and stole hogs from Thomas Mathew, in retaliation for him not paying them for traded goods. Mathew and other colonists pursued them to Maryland and killed a group of Doeg, as well as innocent Susquehannock. A Doeg war party retaliated by killing Mathew's son and two servants on his plantation. {{Citation needed|reason=Whole paragraph unsubstantiated|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn retaliation, a Virginian militia led by Nathaniel Bacon entered Maryland, attacked the Doeg and besieged the Susquehannock. This precipitated the general reaction against natives by the Virginia Colony that resulted in \"Bacon's Rebellion\". In 1676 Bacon took his armed force to the Green Dragon Swamp on the upper Pamunkey River where he killed nearly fifty Pamunkey Indians, which lead to the chief Cockacoeske issuing orders to the rest of the tribe to escape. She ordered her tribe to not harm anyone and stay true to their treaty of peace.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ethan A.

In addition, many colonists wished to attack and claim  Native American frontier land westward, but they were denied permission by Gov. Berkeley.<ref name=\"Foner\" />  Many of these colonists were former indentured servants whose contracts had terminated and who were now free, looking for land.\n\nModern historians have suggested the rebellion may have been a power play by Bacon against Berkeley and his favoritism towards certain members of the court. While Bacon was on the court, he was not within Berkeley's inner circle of council members and disagreed with him on many issues.  Bacon's financial backers included men of wealth from outside Berkeley's circle of influence.<ref name=Foner />\n\nHistorian Peter Thompson argues that Bacon's motivation was a personal vendetta between  Berkeley and him. However, Bacon's followers used the rebellion as an effort to gain government recognition of the shared interests among all social classes of the colony in protecting the \"commonality\" and advancing its welfare.<ref>Peter Thompson, \"The Thief, the Householder, and the Commons: Languages of Class in Seventeenth-Century Virginia,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (2006) 63#2 pp 253-280 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3877353 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n== Rebellion ==\nWhen Sir William Berkeley refused to retaliate against the Native Americans, farmers gathered around at the report of a new raiding party. Nathaniel Bacon arrived with a quantity of brandy; after it was distributed, he was elected leader. Against Berkeley's orders, the group struck south until they came to the [[Occaneechi]] people. After convincing the Occaneechi to attack the [[Susquehannock]], Bacon and his men followed by killing most of the men, women, and children at the village. Upon their return, they discovered that Berkeley had called for new elections to the Burgesses to better address the Native American raids.<ref>John Berry, Francis Moryson, and Herbert Jefferys, \"A True Narrative of the Rise, Progress and Cessation of the Late Rebellion in Virginia, Most Humbly an Impartially Recorded by His Majesties Commissioners, Appointed to inquire into the Affairs of the Said Colony\", Ed. by Charles Andrews, in ''Narrative of the Insurrections 1675 to 1690'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1915, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref>\n\n[[File:A Fair Mark - Shoot.jpg|thumb|Governor Berkeley baring his breast for Bacon to shoot after refusing him a commission (1895 engraving)]]\nThe recomposed [[House of Burgesses]] enacted a number of sweeping reforms (known as [[Bacon's Laws]]).

The governor, however, refused to yield to the pressure. When Bacon had his men take aim at Berkeley, he responded by \"baring his breast\" to Bacon and told Bacon to shoot him. Seeing that the governor would not be moved, Bacon then had his men take aim at the assembled burgesses, who quickly granted Bacon his commission. Bacon had earlier been promised a commission before he retired to his estate if he maintained \"good\" behavior for two weeks.

His grievances against the governor stemmed from Berkeley's dismissive policy to the political challenges of its western frontier, particularly leaving Bacon out of his inner circle and refusing to allow Bacon to take part in fur trading with [[Native American tribes in Virginia|Native Americans]], and Berkeley refusing Bacon a military commission that would allow him to fight and attack Native Americans at his own discretion. Attacks by the [[Doeg people]] are credited with inciting the popular uprising against Berkeley for failing to address the demands of the colonists regarding the safety of the frontier. The Doeg people had both traded and made war on the Virginia frontier.\n\nStarting in the 1650s, as English colonists began to settle the Northern Neck frontier, then known as Chicacoan (Secocowon), some Doeg, Patawomeck and Rappahannock began moving into the region as well and joined local tribes in disputing the settlers' claims to land and resources. In July 1666, the colonists declared war on them. By 1669, colonists had patented the land on the west of the Potomac as far north as My Lord's Island. By 1670, they had driven most of the Doeg out of the Virginia colony and into Maryland\u2014apart from those living beside the Nanzatico/Portobago in Caroline County, Virginia.\n\nThe English continued to harass the Doeg on the Northern Neck and in July 1675, a Doeg raiding party crossed the Potomac and stole hogs from Thomas Mathew, in retaliation for him not paying them for traded goods. Mathew and other colonists pursued them to Maryland and killed a group of Doeg, as well as innocent Susquehannock. A Doeg war party retaliated by killing Mathew's son and two servants on his plantation. {{Citation needed|reason=Whole paragraph unsubstantiated|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn retaliation, a Virginian militia led by Nathaniel Bacon entered Maryland, attacked the Doeg and besieged the Susquehannock. This precipitated the general reaction against natives by the Virginia Colony that resulted in \"Bacon's Rebellion\". In 1676 Bacon took his armed force to the Green Dragon Swamp on the upper Pamunkey River where he killed nearly fifty Pamunkey Indians, which lead to the chief Cockacoeske issuing orders to the rest of the tribe to escape.

In addition, many colonists wished to attack and claim  Native American frontier land westward, but they were denied permission by Gov. Berkeley.<ref name=\"Foner\" />  Many of these colonists were former indentured servants whose contracts had terminated and who were now free, looking for land.\n\nModern historians have suggested the rebellion may have been a power play by Bacon against Berkeley and his favoritism towards certain members of the court. While Bacon was on the court, he was not within Berkeley's inner circle of council members and disagreed with him on many issues.  Bacon's financial backers included men of wealth from outside Berkeley's circle of influence.<ref name=Foner />\n\nHistorian Peter Thompson argues that Bacon's motivation was a personal vendetta between  Berkeley and him. However, Bacon's followers used the rebellion as an effort to gain government recognition of the shared interests among all social classes of the colony in protecting the \"commonality\" and advancing its welfare.<ref>Peter Thompson, \"The Thief, the Householder, and the Commons: Languages of Class in Seventeenth-Century Virginia,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (2006) 63#2 pp 253-280 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3877353 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n== Rebellion ==\nWhen Sir William Berkeley refused to retaliate against the Native Americans, farmers gathered around at the report of a new raiding party. Nathaniel Bacon arrived with a quantity of brandy; after it was distributed, he was elected leader. Against Berkeley's orders, the group struck south until they came to the [[Occaneechi]] people. After convincing the Occaneechi to attack the [[Susquehannock]], Bacon and his men followed by killing most of the men, women, and children at the village. Upon their return, they discovered that Berkeley had called for new elections to the Burgesses to better address the Native American raids.<ref>John Berry, Francis Moryson, and Herbert Jefferys, \"A True Narrative of the Rise, Progress and Cessation of the Late Rebellion in Virginia, Most Humbly an Impartially Recorded by His Majesties Commissioners, Appointed to inquire into the Affairs of the Said Colony\", Ed. by Charles Andrews, in ''Narrative of the Insurrections 1675 to 1690'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1915, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref>\n\n[[File:A Fair Mark - Shoot.jpg|thumb|Governor Berkeley baring his breast for Bacon to shoot after refusing him a commission (1895 engraving)]]\nThe recomposed [[House of Burgesses]] enacted a number of sweeping reforms (known as [[Bacon's Laws]]).

The governor, however, refused to yield to the pressure. When Bacon had his men take aim at Berkeley, he responded by \"baring his breast\" to Bacon and told Bacon to shoot him. Seeing that the governor would not be moved, Bacon then had his men take aim at the assembled burgesses, who quickly granted Bacon his commission. Bacon had earlier been promised a commission before he retired to his estate if he maintained \"good\" behavior for two weeks. While Bacon was at Jamestown with his small army, eight colonists were killed on the frontier in Henrico County (from where he marched) owing to a lack of manpower on the frontier.<ref>John Berry, Francis Moryson, and Herbert Jefferys, \"A True Narrative of the Rise, Progress and Cessation of the Late Rebellion in Virginia, Most Humbly an Impartially Recorded by His Majesties Commissioners, Appointed to inquire into the Affairs of the Said Colony.\" Ed. by Charles Andrews, in ''Narrative of the Insurrections 1675 to 1690'', (Charles Scribner's Sons: New York, 1915), 116.</ref>\n\nOn July 30, 1676, Bacon and his army issued the \"[[Declaration of the People]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/bacons-rebellion.htm|title=Bacon's Rebellion|work=nps.gov|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=October 6, 2015|last=McCulley|first=Susan|date=June 1987}}</ref> The declaration criticized Berkeley's administration in detail.

The most idolizing portrait of Bacon is found in ''Torchbearer of the Revolution'' (1940) by [[Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker]], which one scholar in 2011 called \"one of the worst books on Virginia that a reputable scholarly historian ever published.\"<ref>Tarter, Brent. \"Bacon's Rebellion, the Grievances of the People, and the Political Culture of Seventeenth-Century Virginia.\" The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 119, no. 1 (2011): 6; Rice, James D.

Pg. 204.</ref>  The central area of debate is Bacon's controversial character and complex disposition, as illustrated by [[Wilcomb Washburn]]'s ''The Governor and the Rebel'' (1957). Rather than singing Bacon's praises and chastising Berkeley's tyranny, Washburn found the roots of the rebellion in the colonists' intolerable demand to \"authorize the slaughter and dispossession of the innocent as well as the guilty.\"<ref>Washburn, ''The Governor and the Rebel'', p. 163</ref>\n\nMore nuanced approaches on Berkeley's supposed tyranny or mismanagement entertained specialist historians throughout the middle of the century, leading to a diversification of factors responsible for Virginia's contemporary instability. [[Wesley Frank Craven]] in the 1968 publication ''The Colonies in Transition'' argues that Berkeley's greatest failings took place during the revolt, near the end of his life.<ref>Craven, Wesley Frank.

Morgan]]'s classic 1975 ''[[American Slavery, American Freedom]]:  The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia'' connected the calamity of Bacon's Rebellion, namely the potential for lower-class revolt, with the colony's transition over to slavery: \"..But for those with eyes to see, there was an obvious lesson in the rebellion.

WSL PURE has contributed an initial $1.5 million in funding that will support scientists from the Columbia University Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, as they lead research into ocean health & ecosystems, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and the role the oceans play in climate change.\n\n=== Equal pay for athletes in 2019 ===\nOn September 5, 2018, the World Surf League announced equal pay for every female and male WSL event. CEO [[Sophie Goldschmidt]] said, \"This is a huge step forward in our long-planned strategy to elevate women's surfing and we are thrilled to make this commitment as we reveal our new 2019 schedule...\".<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldsurfleague.com/posts/345569/the-world-surf-league-wsl-announces-prize-money-equality|title=The World Surf League (WSL) Announces Prize Money Equality|website=World Surf League|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> The announcement prompted a conversation about equal pay for professional athletes and the world commended the WSL for leading the way. 7 x world surfing champion [[Stephanie Gilmore]] said \"I hope this serves as a model for other sports, global organizations and society as a whole.

This criterion is different from in [[longboarding]] competitions.  All of this is focused on creating some type consistency that can be seen throughout the many different events.<ref>{{cite web|title = Rules and Regulations|url = http://www.worldsurfleague.com/pages/rules-and-regulations|publisher = World Surf League|accessdate = 30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe events themselves are previously declared QS 1,000 - QS 10,000 events; among other things this ranking shows what numbers of judges which are required at the event. QS 1,000 - QS 3,000 Qualifying Series events are required to have a six judge panel with four judges on each heat. A QS 4,000 - QS 6,000 Qualifying Series event requires seven judges with five of those judges on each heat. At QS 5,000 - QS 10,000 Qualifying Series events there are only allowed to be 3 judges from any one region. This is then limited to two at any world championship events.  All events also require an WSL approved head judge who has the ability to make corrections to errors or any other events that may have affected the results.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Rules ===\nThere are many rules out in the water that all revolve around the idea of right of way. A surfer has the right of way if he or she is closer to the area where the wave is breaking, this is more commonly referred to as having the inside position. If another surfer takes off in front of the surfer that has the inside position, then interference will be called, and penalties will be enacted. In most circumstances it does not matter who stood up first but who has the inside position.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA surfer can also be found guilty of interference if they catch more than their maximum number of waves in a heat and that this takes away from the other competitors ability to catch waves. A competitor is also not allowed to interfere with another competitor's [[paddling]] and maneuvering for a wave.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe rules of right of way vary slightly with the type of break. [[Point break (surfing)|Point Breaks]] will always have a consistent direct of what is inside, that is, the person further up the line will have right of way. In a single peak situation where there is both a left and a right two people are able to be on the wave at the same time, provided that one goes left and one goes right and that neither crosses the path of the other to go one direction. If this does happen then, the surfer who stood up first will get the right of way. On a multi-peaked wave where the wave eventually comes together, both peaks can be surfed until the surfers come together. When they do the surfer who stood up first has right of way, and the other must maneuver to get off the wave without interrupting the other surfer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn a one-on-one competition, priority can be declared by the Head Judge. Once the person with priority has paddled for a wave priority is then turned over to the next person until that person does the same. The person with second priority can paddle for waves as long as it does not interfere with the other person who will lose their priority only if they catch a wave.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA surfer who has already taken off or obtained possession of a [[wave]] maintains this position until the end of their ride. If another surfer takes off on the inside of this surfer, then this person does not obtain priority and is considered to be snaking. If this surfer does not hurt the other surfers ride, then both people can be scored based. If the judges determine that the snaking did interfere then the person will be penalized. \nInterference penalties are called by the judges and must have a majority to be declared an actual penalty. Interference are shown as triangles on the score cards in various different ways depending on when or where in the heat they were made. If three or more waves are being scored than one wave will be dropped off the score card. If only the top two waves are being scored, then 50% of the second best-scored wave will be taken off. If a surfer has more than one then 50% of the best waves score will be taken off also. The surfer who has been interfered with will be allowed an additional wave to their maximum as long as it is within the time limit. If a surfer interferes more than twice in a heat then they must leave the competition area.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==WSL Championship Tour champions==\n[[File:Gabriel Medina - Reigning World Champion .jpg|alt=|thumb|425x425px|Gabriel Medina, 2018 WSL Championship Tour Champion]]\n<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.worldsurfleague.com/pages/history|title = History - Historic Results|accessdate = 23 February 2017|website = World Surf League}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The app provides real-time updates on competitions and provides personalized alerts, letting fans know when their favorite athletes are about to enter the water.\n\nIn April 2016, the World Surf League introduced WSL PURE, its philanthropic initiative dedicated to supporting ocean health through research, education and advocacy.  WSL PURE has contributed an initial $1.5 million in funding that will support scientists from the Columbia University Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, as they lead research into ocean health & ecosystems, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and the role the oceans play in climate change.\n\n=== Equal pay for athletes in 2019 ===\nOn September 5, 2018, the World Surf League announced equal pay for every female and male WSL event.

This criterion is different from in [[longboarding]] competitions.  All of this is focused on creating some type consistency that can be seen throughout the many different events.<ref>{{cite web|title = Rules and Regulations|url = http://www.worldsurfleague.com/pages/rules-and-regulations|publisher = World Surf League|accessdate = 30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe events themselves are previously declared QS 1,000 - QS 10,000 events; among other things this ranking shows what numbers of judges which are required at the event. QS 1,000 - QS 3,000 Qualifying Series events are required to have a six judge panel with four judges on each heat. A QS 4,000 - QS 6,000 Qualifying Series event requires seven judges with five of those judges on each heat. At QS 5,000 - QS 10,000 Qualifying Series events there are only allowed to be 3 judges from any one region. This is then limited to two at any world championship events.  All events also require an WSL approved head judge who has the ability to make corrections to errors or any other events that may have affected the results.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Rules ===\nThere are many rules out in the water that all revolve around the idea of right of way. A surfer has the right of way if he or she is closer to the area where the wave is breaking, this is more commonly referred to as having the inside position. If another surfer takes off in front of the surfer that has the inside position, then interference will be called, and penalties will be enacted. In most circumstances it does not matter who stood up first but who has the inside position.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA surfer can also be found guilty of interference if they catch more than their maximum number of waves in a heat and that this takes away from the other competitors ability to catch waves. A competitor is also not allowed to interfere with another competitor's [[paddling]] and maneuvering for a wave.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe rules of right of way vary slightly with the type of break. [[Point break (surfing)|Point Breaks]] will always have a consistent direct of what is inside, that is, the person further up the line will have right of way. In a single peak situation where there is both a left and a right two people are able to be on the wave at the same time, provided that one goes left and one goes right and that neither crosses the path of the other to go one direction. If this does happen then, the surfer who stood up first will get the right of way. On a multi-peaked wave where the wave eventually comes together, both peaks can be surfed until the surfers come together. When they do the surfer who stood up first has right of way, and the other must maneuver to get off the wave without interrupting the other surfer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn a one-on-one competition, priority can be declared by the Head Judge. Once the person with priority has paddled for a wave priority is then turned over to the next person until that person does the same. The person with second priority can paddle for waves as long as it does not interfere with the other person who will lose their priority only if they catch a wave.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA surfer who has already taken off or obtained possession of a [[wave]] maintains this position until the end of their ride. If another surfer takes off on the inside of this surfer, then this person does not obtain priority and is considered to be snaking. If this surfer does not hurt the other surfers ride, then both people can be scored based. If the judges determine that the snaking did interfere then the person will be penalized. \nInterference penalties are called by the judges and must have a majority to be declared an actual penalty. Interference are shown as triangles on the score cards in various different ways depending on when or where in the heat they were made. If three or more waves are being scored than one wave will be dropped off the score card. If only the top two waves are being scored, then 50% of the second best-scored wave will be taken off. If a surfer has more than one then 50% of the best waves score will be taken off also. The surfer who has been interfered with will be allowed an additional wave to their maximum as long as it is within the time limit. If a surfer interferes more than twice in a heat then they must leave the competition area.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==WSL Championship Tour champions==\n[[File:Gabriel Medina - Reigning World Champion .jpg|alt=|thumb|425x425px|Gabriel Medina, 2018 WSL Championship Tour Champion]]\n<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.worldsurfleague.com/pages/history|title = History - Historic Results|accessdate = 23 February 2017|website = World Surf League}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
