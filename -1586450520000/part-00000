Born in [[Galle]], [[Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]), Crusz immigrated to [[Toronto]], Canada in 1965 and soon after began publishing poetry. Though his poetry deals with a wide variety of human experience, Crusz is best known for his poetry that illuminates his experience of immigration, migrancy and the alienation of [[exile]].<ref name=Blackburn/>\n\n==Early life==\nAs a young child Crusz's family moved to [[Colombo]], where he attended high school at St. Joseph's and St. Peter's colleges. Crusz's education was in English, and he was exposed to much of the canon of Western literature including Shakespeare, Milton, and Dylan Thomas (to whom he is sometimes compared), which would later influence his writing. Nonetheless, his poetry cites Sri Lanka as a place of memory and longing, Buddhism in \"Karma\" and other poems, the sounds of the rabana drum and classical Sri Lankan dance, though as he said in a 2014 interview that his work is \"not a travel book\".  His [[Catholic]] upbringing would also heavily influence his poetry especially \"Gambolling with the Divine\".<ref name=Blackburn>{{cite book|last=Blackburn|first=Di Gan|title=Asian-American Poets: a Bio-bibliographical Critical Sourcebook|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport|isbn=0-313-31809-3|pages=89|editor=Guiyou Huang}}</ref>\n\n==Education and employment==\nCrusz received a Bachelor of Arts in history at the [[University of Colombo]] in 1948. In 1951 Crusz went to England to study library science at the School of Librarianship and Archives at the [[University of London]] as a [[Colombo Plan]] Scholar. After returning from England Crusz worked at the Central Bank of Ceylon as chief reference librarian until immigrating to Canada in 1965. Crusz earned a [[Bachelor of Library Science]] at the [[University of Toronto]] after his arrival, and then attained a Master of Arts in History at the [[University of Waterloo]]. He remained at the University of Waterloo until 1993 as a senior reference and collections development librarian.

Another town, Embeke (later {{lang-de|Neu-Pernau}}, {{lang-et|Uus-P\u00e4rnu}}) was founded by the [[Livonian Order]], who began building an [[Ordensburg]] nearby in 1265. The latter town, then known by the German name of {{lang|de|Pernau}}, was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] and an important ice-free harbor for [[Livonia]]. The [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] took control of town between 1560\u20131617; the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poles]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]ns fought the [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]] nearby in 1609. Sweden took control of the town during the 16th-century [[Livonian War]] as part of [[Swedish Livonia]], although it was not formally ceded by Poland-Lithuania until the 1660 [[Treaty of Oliva]]. Sweden then lost Livonia to the [[Russian Empire]] in the 1710 [[Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia]] and the 1721 [[Treaty of Nystad]], following the [[Great Northern War]]. It belonged to the [[Imperial Russia]]n [[Governorate of Livonia]] until 1917, when it was transferred to the short-lived [[Autonomous Governorate of Estonia]]. The city is occasionally referred to as ''Pyarnu'', an incorrect reverse-[[transliteration]] from the Russian {{lang|ru|\u041f\u044f\u0440\u043d\u0443}}.\n\nThe town became part of independent Estonia in 1918 following [[World War I]].\n\nThe city was occupied by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] along with the rest of Estonia in 1940 during [[World War II]], and its German population left the town. It was then occupied by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] from 1941 until 1944 before it was reoccupied by the Soviet Union as part of the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] from 1944\u20131991.\n\nDuring the [[Great Northern War]], the [[University of Dorpat]] ([[Tartu]]) was relocated to Pernau from 1699\u20131710. The university has a branch campus in P\u00e4rnu today (1,000 students in the 2004/2005 school year).<ref>[https://www.pc.ut.ee/en University of Tartu P\u00e4rnu College]</ref>\n\nIn 2002 a war memorial was erected in P\u00e4rnu showing a bas-relief of a soldier in a [[Waffen SS]] uniform along with the words: \u201cTo all Estonian soldiers who died in the war of liberation for their country and a free Europe in the years 1941\u20131945.\u201d<ref>Daniel Lazare: [https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/09/timothy-snyders-lies/ Timothy Snyder\u2019s Lies].

Located in southwestern Estonia on the coast of [[P\u00e4rnu Bay]], an inlet of the [[Gulf of Riga]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]. It is a popular summer [[Tourism|holiday]] resort with many [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and large [[beach]]es. The [[P\u00e4rnu River]] flows through the city and drains into the Gulf of Riga. The city was served by [[P\u00e4rnu Airport]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Pernau 1554.jpg|thumb|left|P\u00e4rnu in 1554]]\nPerona ({{lang-de|Alt-Pernau|links=no}}, {{lang-et|Vana-P\u00e4rnu|links=no}}), which was founded by the bishop of [[Bishopric of \u00d6sel\u2013Wiek|\u00d6sel\u2013Wiek]] {{circa|1251}}, suffered heavily under pressure of the concurrent town, and was finally destroyed {{circa|1600}}. Another town, Embeke (later {{lang-de|Neu-Pernau}}, {{lang-et|Uus-P\u00e4rnu}}) was founded by the [[Livonian Order]], who began building an [[Ordensburg]] nearby in 1265. The latter town, then known by the German name of {{lang|de|Pernau}}, was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] and an important ice-free harbor for [[Livonia]]. The [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] took control of town between 1560\u20131617; the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poles]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]ns fought the [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]] nearby in 1609. Sweden took control of the town during the 16th-century [[Livonian War]] as part of [[Swedish Livonia]], although it was not formally ceded by Poland-Lithuania until the 1660 [[Treaty of Oliva]]. Sweden then lost Livonia to the [[Russian Empire]] in the 1710 [[Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia]] and the 1721 [[Treaty of Nystad]], following the [[Great Northern War]]. It belonged to the [[Imperial Russia]]n [[Governorate of Livonia]] until 1917, when it was transferred to the short-lived [[Autonomous Governorate of Estonia]]. The city is occasionally referred to as ''Pyarnu'', an incorrect reverse-[[transliteration]] from the Russian {{lang|ru|\u041f\u044f\u0440\u043d\u0443}}.\n\nThe town became part of independent Estonia in 1918 following [[World War I]].\n\nThe city was occupied by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] along with the rest of Estonia in 1940 during [[World War II]], and its German population left the town. It was then occupied by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] from 1941 until 1944 before it was reoccupied by the Soviet Union as part of the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] from 1944\u20131991.\n\nDuring the [[Great Northern War]], the [[University of Dorpat]] ([[Tartu]]) was relocated to Pernau from 1699\u20131710. The university has a branch campus in P\u00e4rnu today (1,000 students in the 2004/2005 school year).<ref>[https://www.pc.ut.ee/en University of Tartu P\u00e4rnu College]</ref>\n\nIn 2002 a war memorial was erected in P\u00e4rnu showing a bas-relief of a soldier in a [[Waffen SS]] uniform along with the words: \u201cTo all Estonian soldiers who died in the war of liberation for their country and a free Europe in the years 1941\u20131945.\u201d<ref>Daniel Lazare: [https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/09/timothy-snyders-lies/ Timothy Snyder\u2019s Lies].

Ashworth stated, \"Behind each of these cancellations is a sick child and their loved ones facing unnecessary distress for entirely avoidable reasons.  These cancelled operations risk harming children further in the long term and it\u2019s shameful that cancellations have reached this level [18647 children's operations cancelled in 2017].  The fact that thousands of children\u2019s operations \u2013 including for broken bones, removing rotten teeth, eye surgery and even breast cancer \u2013 have had to be cancelled on this scale reveals yet again an NHS pushed to the brink by the Tories.\u201d<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/27/record-number-of-childrens-operations-cancelled-last-year Record number of children's operations cancelled last year] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027191122/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/27/record-number-of-childrens-operations-cancelled-last-year |date=27 October 2018 }} ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>\n\nAshworth expressed concern over staff shortages in the NHS, projected to increase during the coming decade.

The team competes in the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS) and are members of the [[Ivy League]]. Brown's first football team was fielded in 1878. The Bears play their home games at the 20,000-seat [[Brown Stadium]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. The team's head coach is [[James Perry (American football)|James Perry]], who was hired on December 3, 2018.\n\n==History==\nIn the middle of the 1926 season, the \u201cIron Men\u201d came into being when the same 11 players played against Yale for 60 minutes and a 7\u20130 win. The next week the same 11 players played without substitution against Dartmouth and won 10\u20130. Two weeks later the Iron Men played 58 minutes against Harvard, but in the last two minutes the substitutes came in to earn their letters. Brown won all its games that year until the Thanksgiving game against Colgate ended in a 10\u201310 tie. The famed \u201cIron Men\u201d were Thurston Towle \u201928, Paul Hodge \u201928, Orland Smith \u201927, Charles Considine \u201928, Lou Farber \u201929, Ed Kevorkian \u201929, Hal Broda \u201927, Al Cornsweet \u201929, Dave Mishel \u201927, Ed Lawrence \u201928, and Roy Randall \u201928. In the 1948 season, Brown fans were the originators of the popular \"de-fense!\" chant that spread to the NFL in the 1950s. Following the [[1981 NCAA Division I-A football season|1981 season]], the Ivy League was reclassified to [[Division I-AA]], today known as the [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS), Brown moved to Division I-AA play with the rest of the league.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/17/sports/ncaafootball/17ivy.html?ei=5088&en=eef43e83c884e0f3&ex=1321419600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print New York Times] \u2013 2006-11-17</ref> Brown has 607 wins, making them tied for 72nd all time in wins among division one football programs.   \n\nIn 1997, Phil Estes began a twenty-one year tenure as Brown's head coach, resulting in three Ivy League championships.

The team competes in the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS) and are members of the [[Ivy League]]. Brown's first football team was fielded in 1878. The Bears play their home games at the 20,000-seat [[Brown Stadium]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. The team's head coach is James Perry, who was hired on December 3, 2018.\n\n==History==\nIn the middle of the 1926 season, the \u201cIron Men\u201d came into being when the same 11 players played against Yale for 60 minutes and a 7\u20130 win. The next week the same 11 players played without substitution against Dartmouth and won 10\u20130. Two weeks later the Iron Men played 58 minutes against Harvard, but in the last two minutes the substitutes came in to earn their letters. Brown won all its games that year until the Thanksgiving game against Colgate ended in a 10\u201310 tie. The famed \u201cIron Men\u201d were Thurston Towle \u201928, Paul Hodge \u201928, Orland Smith \u201927, Charles Considine \u201928, Lou Farber \u201929, Ed Kevorkian \u201929, Hal Broda \u201927, Al Cornsweet \u201929, Dave Mishel \u201927, Ed Lawrence \u201928, and Roy Randall \u201928. In the 1948 season, Brown fans were the originators of the popular \"de-fense!\" chant that spread to the NFL in the 1950s. Following the [[1981 NCAA Division I-A football season|1981 season]], the Ivy League was reclassified to [[Division I-AA]], today known as the [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS), Brown moved to Division I-AA play with the rest of the league.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/17/sports/ncaafootball/17ivy.html?ei=5088&en=eef43e83c884e0f3&ex=1321419600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print New York Times] \u2013 2006-11-17</ref> Brown has 607 wins, making them tied for 72nd all time in wins among division one football programs.   \n\nIn 1997, Phil Estes began a twenty-one year tenure as Brown's head coach, resulting in three Ivy League championships. In 2018, after two consecutive winless seasons in the Ivy League, Estes announced that he would be stepping down.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/25324886/phil-estes-steps-brown-bears-coach|title=Estes steps down as Brown's coach|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Championships ==\nThe Bears have no national championships, though they do have one undefeated team, the [[1926 Brown Bears football team|1926 team]], also known as the Iron Men of 1926, finishing 9\u20130\u20131 (and winning all three of their Ivy League games), with a 10\u201310 tie with [[Colgate Raiders football|Colgate]] in the last game of the season. \n\n===Conference championships===\nThe Bears have won the Ivy League title four times in their history.

He then served as the 30th Treasurer of Pennsylvania from January 20, 1981, until he committed suicide during a press conference.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Pennsylvania discovered its state workers had overpaid federal taxes due to errors in state withholding prior to Dwyer's administration. A multi-million-dollar recovery contract was required to determine the compensation to be given to each employee. In 1986, Dwyer was convicted \nfor accepting a bribe from the California firm that won the contract. He was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and was scheduled to be sentenced on January 23, 1987.\n\nOn January 22, 1987, Dwyer called a news conference in the Pennsylvania state capital of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] where he killed himself in front of the gathered reporters, by shooting himself with a [[.357 Magnum]] revolver.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDF1638F930A15752C0A961948260|title=Official calls in press and kills himself|last=Stevens|first=William K.|date=January 23, 1987|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 11, 2008}}</ref> Dwyer's [[suicide]] was broadcast later that day to a wide television audience across Pennsylvania.\n\nThroughout Dwyer's trial and after his conviction, Dwyer maintained that he was not guilty of the charges for which he was convicted, and that his conviction resulted from political persecution. In 2010, the prosecution's main witness, [[William Trickett Smith]], maintained that his testimony at Dwyer's 1986 trial\u2014 in which he stated that he offered Dwyer a bribe, and that Dwyer accepted this offer\u2014  was truthful, and that he had committed perjury at his own 1985 trial when he denied offering Dwyer a bribe.<ref name=\"Honest Man\">{{Cite web|url = http://dwyermovie.com/|title = Honest Man: The Life of R.Budd Dwyer (documentary movie)|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Eighty Four Films|last = |first =}}</ref> Moreover, Smith stated in October 1984\u2014 the year before his own trial\u2014 that he offered Dwyer a bribe, and that Dwyer accepted it.<ref name=\"Latrobe\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42456853/latrobe_bulletin/|title=New evidence challenges Dwyer|last=Morris|first=David|date=February 18, 1987|work=Latrobe Bulletin|access-date=January 17, 2020|url-status=live|pages=4}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:R.

This speech lasted nearly 30 minutes, and approximately halfway into it, with no apparent end in sight, some of the gathered press began to pack up and leave. Dwyer spotted this and interrupted himself to say, \"Those of you who are putting your cameras away, I think you ought to stay because we're not, we're not finished yet.\"<ref name=\"philly-archives1987-01-23\" />\n\nGiven the inflammatory nature of portions of Dwyer's text, press secretary Horshock had considered interrupting him outright to stop him but concluded that he would hold his own press conference after Dwyer's. \"I had to make it known that I was not aware of the content of the statement. I didn't want it to be thought that I wrote that for him.\"<ref name=\"PittsburghPress\" />\n\nUpon reaching the final page of his statement, which had not been distributed to the press nor press secretary Horshock in advance, Dwyer paused. \"...and I'm on the last page now, and I don't have enough to pass out, but Duke [Horshock], I'll leave this here, and you can make copies for the people; there's a few extra copies here right now.\"<ref>Video containing audio of final words ([http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6686827830708949101 link])</ref> Dwyer continued,\n\n{{quote|I thank the good Lord for giving me 47 years of exciting challenges, stimulating experiences, many happy occasions and most of all[,] the finest wife and children any man could ever desire.\n\nNow my life has changed for no apparent reason.

Some who have called have said that I am a modern day [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]].\n\nJudge Muir is also noted for his medieval sentences. I face a maximum sentence of 55 years in prison and a $305,000 fine for being innocent. Judge Muir has already told the press that he felt \"invigorated\" when we were found guilty and that he plans to imprison me as a \"deterrant\" to other public officials. But it wouldn't be a deterrant [''sic''] because every public official who knows me knows that I am innocent. It wouldn't be legitimate punishment because I've done nothing wrong. Since I'm a victim of political persecution, my prison would simply be an American [[Gulag]].\n\nI ask those that believe in me to continue to extend friendship and prayer to my family, to work untiringly for the creation of a true justice system here in the United States, and to press on with the efforts to vindicate me, so that my family and their future families are not tainted by this injustice that has been perpetrated on me.\n\nWe were confident that right and truth would prevail and I would be acquitted and we would devote the rest of our lives working to create a justice system here in the United States. The guilty verdict has strengthened that resolve. But as we've discussed our plans to expose the warts of our legal system[,] people have said, 'Why bother? No one cares, you'll look foolish, ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'', the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]], and others have been publicizing cases like yours for years and it doesn't bother anyone.'}}\n\nAt this point, Dwyer stopped reading from his prepared remarks, with the gathered press still waiting on his expected resignation. There was still a significant portion remaining, which detailed what he was actually planning to do, and it read as follows:\n\n{{quote|I've repeatedly said that I'm not going to resign as State Treasurer. After many hours of thought and meditation I've made a decision that should not be an example to anyone because it is unique to my situation. Last May I told you that after the trial, I would give you the story of the decade. To those of you who are shallow, the events of this morning will be that story.

Group W's news cameraman William L. \"Bill\" Martin and reporter David Sollenberger had a camera set up at the conference. They chose to air the audio with a freeze-frame of the gun in Dwyer's mouth. Only a handful aired the unedited press conference.

[[WPXI-TV|WPXI]] in [[Pittsburgh]] is reported by the [[Associated Press]] to have broadcast the footage uncensored on an early newscast.

He then served as the 30th Treasurer of Pennsylvania from January 20, 1981, until he committed suicide during a press conference.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Pennsylvania discovered its state workers had overpaid federal taxes due to errors in state withholding prior to Dwyer's administration. A multi-million-dollar recovery contract was required to determine the compensation to be given to each employee. In 1986, Dwyer was convicted \nfor accepting a bribe from the California firm that won the contract. He was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and was scheduled to be sentenced on January 23, 1987.\n\nOn January 22, 1987, Dwyer called a news conference in the Pennsylvania state capital of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] where he killed himself in front of the gathered reporters, by shooting himself with a [[.357 Magnum]] revolver.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDF1638F930A15752C0A961948260|title=Official calls in press and kills himself|last=Stevens|first=William K.|date=January 23, 1987|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 11, 2008}}</ref> Dwyer's [[suicide]] was broadcast later that day to a wide television audience across Pennsylvania.\n\nThroughout Dwyer's trial and after his conviction, Dwyer maintained that he was not guilty of the charges for which he was convicted, and that his conviction resulted from political persecution.

Since I'm a victim of political persecution, my prison would simply be an American [[Gulag]].\n\nI ask those that believe in me to continue to extend friendship and prayer to my family, to work untiringly for the creation of a true justice system here in the United States, and to press on with the efforts to vindicate me, so that my family and their future families are not tainted by this injustice that has been perpetrated on me.\n\nWe were confident that right and truth would prevail and I would be acquitted and we would devote the rest of our lives working to create a justice system here in the United States. The guilty verdict has strengthened that resolve. But as we've discussed our plans to expose the warts of our legal system[,] people have said, 'Why bother? No one cares, you'll look foolish, ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'', the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]], and others have been publicizing cases like yours for years and it doesn't bother anyone.'}}\n\nAt this point, Dwyer stopped reading from his prepared remarks, with the gathered press still waiting on his expected resignation. There was still a significant portion remaining, which detailed what he was actually planning to do, and it read as follows:\n\n{{quote|I've repeatedly said that I'm not going to resign as State Treasurer. After many hours of thought and meditation I've made a decision that should not be an example to anyone because it is unique to my situation. Last May I told you that after the trial, I would give you the story of the decade. To those of you who are shallow, the events of this morning will be that story. But to those of you with depth and concern the real story will be what I hope and pray results from this morning\u2013in the coming months and years[,] the development of a true justice system here in the United States. I am going to die in office in an effort to ' ... see if the shame[-ful] facts, spread out in all their shame, will not burn through our civic shamelessness and set fire to American pride.' Please tell my story on every radio and television station and in every newspaper and magazine in the U.S.. Please leave immediately if you have a weak stomach or mind since I don't want to cause physical or mental distress. Joanne, Rob, DeeDEe [''sic''] - I love you! Thank you for making my life so happy. Good bye to you all on the count of 3. Please make sure that the sacrifice of my life is not in vain.}}\n\nAfter deciding to break from his speech, Dwyer called to three of his staffers, giving each a sealed envelope with the insignia of the treasury department.<ref name=\"PittsburghPress\" /> The first envelope, given to [[Bob Holste]], contained a letter addressed to then-Pennsylvania Governor [[Robert P. Casey|Bob Casey]], who had taken office just two days earlier. The second, given to deputy press secretary Gregory Penny, contained an [[organ donation|organ donor]] card and other related materials.

When the crowd in the room saw what Dwyer had pulled out of the envelope, the mood changed immediately from one of waiting to see whether he would resign his office to one of panic as nobody knew what he was planning to do with the gun. People gasped, and Dwyer backed up against the wall, pointing the weapon into the air.

However, the latter two allowed the audio of the shooting to continue under the frozen image. Group W's news cameraman William L. \"Bill\" Martin and reporter David Sollenberger had a camera set up at the conference. They chose to air the audio with a freeze-frame of the gun in Dwyer's mouth. Only a handful aired the unedited press conference. [[WPVI-TV|WPVI]] in [[Philadelphia]] re-broadcast the suicide footage in full on their 5&nbsp;p.m. and 6&nbsp;p.m. [[Action News]] broadcast without warning the viewers. That station's broadcast is a source for copies circulating on the Internet. [[WPXI-TV|WPXI]] in [[Pittsburgh]] is reported by the [[Associated Press]] to have broadcast the footage uncensored on an early newscast. In explaining the decision to air, WPXI operations manager By Williams said, \"It's an important event [about] an important man.\" Williams avoided airing the footage in the evening newscasts, explaining, \"Everyone knows by then that he did it.
