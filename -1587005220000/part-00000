Kimball (1801-1868) {{!}} FamilySearch|website=ancestors.familysearch.org|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref> was a leader in the early [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. He served as one of the original twelve [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]] in the early [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of the Latter Day Saints]], and as first counselor to [[Brigham Young]] in the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) for more than two decades, from 1847 until his death.\n\nAgreeing to take on [[plural marriage]], then part of church doctrine, Kimball eventually married forty-three women, but some relationships were for caretaking. He had a total of sixty-six children by seventeen of his wives.\n\n==Early life==\nHeber Chase Kimball was born in [[Sheldon, Vermont|Sheldon]], [[Franklin County, Vermont]] in 1801. He was a descendant of the Kimball immigrants to Massachusetts from England in 1634. He was named after a judge Heber Chase, who had helped the family in their efforts to settle in the area. Due to the embargo on trade with Britain preceding the [[War of 1812]], his father lost his investments and the family moved into western New York. They settled in [[West Bloomfield, New York]], [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]], around 1811.\n\n===Education and training===\nKimball left school at age 14, trained as a blacksmith and potter, and moved with his brother about 1820 to [[Mendon, New York|Mendon]], [[Monroe County, New York]]. There he married his first wife, Vilate Murray, in 1822.\n\nAfter purchasing his brother's [[pottery]] business, for the next 10 years, he carried out his trades. He acquired five and a half acres (22,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) of land, built a house and a barn, and planted an orchard.\n\n===Masonry===\n{{see also|Mormonism and Freemasonry}}\nIn 1823, Kimball received the three craft degrees of [[Freemason]]ry in the lodge at [[Victor Flats, New York|Victor Flats]], [[Ontario County, New York]]. In 1824, he sent a petition to the chapter at [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua, New York]], to receive the [[York Rite]] degrees of Royal Arch Masonry. His petition was accepted, although, as he reported, [[Anti-Masons]] had burned down the chapter building in Canandaigua. Many years later, Kimball reminisced of his New York masonic experiences and stated: \"I wish that all men were masons and would live up to their profession, then the world would be in a much better state than it is now.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitney|first=Orson F.|title=Life of Heber C. Kimball: Apostle, Father and Founder of the British Mission|year=1888|publisher=Kimball Family|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|page=27|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jdkRAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&authuser=0&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA27}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] established itself in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], Kimball was one of the original petitioners to establish a Freemasonry lodge there. He served as Nauvoo Lodge U.D.'s first Junior Deacon. He remained active in Freemasonry throughout his stay in Nauvoo, but was not active once he moved to [[Utah Territory]]. There was no lodge in Utah in his lifetime that would admit Mormons.<ref>The first time Mormons were admitted to the Freemasons in Utah was 1984. State lodges excluded even those persons who had previously been admitted to other lodges prior to the [[Mormon Exodus]] to the west. <br/>See: {{citation |url= http://www.fairlds.org/fair-conferences/2005-fair-conference/2005-the-message-and-the-messenger-latter-day-saints-and-freemasonry |title= The Message and the Messenger: Latter-day Saints and Freemasonry |first= Greg |last= Kearney |year= 2005 |work= 2005 FAIR Conference |publisher= [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] }};<br/> {{citation |url= http://www.wasatchlodge.org/publish/lodge-history/ |title= The Lodge: Brief History of Wasatch Lodge |work= WasatchLodge.org |publisher= Wasatch Lodge #1 Free & Accepted Masons }}.</ref>\n\n===Early family life===\nSeveral of Kimball's close family members died of [[tuberculosis]] within a few years: his mother in February 1824, his father in the spring of 1826, followed by his brother Charles C. and his brother's wife shortly thereafter.\n\nHis son [[William Henry Kimball|William Henry]] was born in Mendon, April 10, 1826; he was Kimball's first child to survive infancy. His daughter [[Helen Mar Kimball|Helen Mar]] was born August 22, 1828. She was the only daughter to survive.\n\n===Signs in the heavens===\nKimball claims to have witnessed a miraculous event on September 22, 1827. According to his autobiography, he subsequently learned that it \"took place the same evening that [[Joseph Smith]] received the records of the Book of Mormon from the [[Angel Moroni]].\" He had seen \"a white smoke\" arising on the horizon, growing \"clear and transparent of a bluish cast\" to reveal an army on the move \"in platoons\":\n\n<blockquote>We could see distinctly the muskets, bayonets, and knapsacks of the men, who wore caps and feathers like those used by the American soldiers in the last war with Britain; also their officers with their swords and equipage, and heard the clashing and jingling of their instruments of war and could discover the form and features of the men. The most profound order existed throughout the entire army, when the foremost man stepped, every man stepped at the same time: I could hear the step. When the front rank reached the Western horizon a battle ensued, as we could distinctly hear the report of the arms and the rush. No man could judge of my feelings when I beheld that army of men, as plainly as I ever saw armies of men in the flesh it seemed as though every hair of my head was alive. This scenery was gazed upon for hours, until it began to disappear.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Latter-day Saints Millennial Star|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xy8EAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA472|year=1864|page=472}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Joining the Latter Day Saint movement==\nWhile in New York, Kimball joined the local [[Baptist Church]] and was eventually baptized. Three weeks later, three elders from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], the original name of the [[Latter Day Saint]] church founded by [[Joseph Smith]], visited the house of his friend, [[Phineas Young]]. Kimball visited the house at this time and was impressed with church teachings. He also witnessed the speaking of tongues and the interpretation of tongues during this visit. He claims to have been visited by the power of God.\n\nDuring this time, Kimball said that he and several of the Young family saw a vision opened of the \"gathering of the Saints to Zion.\" He was inspired to travel to Pennsylvania where he could visit at length with the elders, and was accompanied by some of the Youngs. They stayed six days with the elders and witnessed more miracles, such as [[Glossolalia|speaking in tongues]] and the interpretation of tongues.\n\nOn April 16, 1832 Kimball was baptized by Alpheus Gifford.<ref>Orson F. Whitney, ''The Life of Heber C. Kimball'' (Salt Lake City, Bookcraft, 1945) p. 21-22</ref>  After the confirmation, the elder offered to ordain Kimball to the priesthood, but Kimball refused it as he felt he was unready. Thirty more people were baptized in Mendon and formed a branch of the church there.\n\nAbout this time, people began calling Kimball \"crazy,\" although he claims he was \"clothed in the right mind.\" He claims the scriptures unfolded for him. Local clergy and members of other faiths soon became antagonistic towards the small Latter-day Saint branch and its members. Kimball had several people make executions on his property to recall considerable debts, which he was nevertheless able to pay off in full.<!--What does this mean - \"executions on his property\"? sounds like a dated term  -->\n\n==Church service==\nShortly after his baptism, Kimball was ordained an elder by [[Joseph Young]]. He began proselyting in the neighboring areas with Joseph and [[Brigham Young]]. This part of New York became known as the \"burnt over district\" because of the numerous religious sects that sprang up during the 19th century. The Youngs baptized many people and built up branches of the church. Kimball said that one day Ezra Landon baptized some 20 people but wanted him to confirm them. He did so, and immediately they began speaking in tongues and interpreting them.\n\nIn 1833, Kimball relocated his family to church headquarters in [[Kirtland, Ohio]]. He marched with [[Zion's Camp]] in 1834. From 1832 until 1840, Kimball served eight missions for the Church, requiring him to be apart from his family for months at a time.<ref>Stanley B. Kimball, \"Heber C. Kimball\" in Arnold K. Garr, Donald Q. Cannon and Rochard O. Cowan, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of LDS Church History'', p. 607</ref>\n\n==Quorum of the Twelve==\nOn February 14, 1835, Kimball was ordained a member of [[The Quorum of Twelve Apostles]] of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of the Latter Day Saints]] (renamed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints<!-- Do not change this name to \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\".

Michael Marquardt and [[Wesley P. Walters]] (1994). ''Inventing Mormonism: Tradition and the Historical Record'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books) p. 160.</ref> in 1838). He was one of the original twelve members of the Quorum, being 4th in seniority.\n\n[[Joseph Smith]] called Kimball to lead a group of missionaries to England in 1837. The mission began work in [[Preston, Lancashire]], England.<ref>Whitney, ''Kimball'', p. 121</ref> After the initial baptisms in Preston, the missionaries expanded their efforts to the Ribble Valley. By the time Kimball departed for the United States in 1838, about 1,500 people had been baptized.<ref>David J. Whitaker and James R. Moss, \"Missions of the Twelve to the British Isles\", in [[Daniel H. Ludlow]], ed. ''Selections from the Encyclopedia of Mormonism:  Church History'' (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1995) p. 331</ref>\n\nKimball returned with a small party to make travel arrangements for the groups and discovered the Latter Day Saints were undergoing considerable strife and pressure in the state of [[Missouri]].\n\nWhile Smith was imprisoned in the [[Liberty Jail]], Brigham Young (now ranking leader of the Quorum) and Kimball organized the removal of approximately 12,000 Latter Day Saint refugees across the border into [[Illinois]].<ref>Edward L. Kimball, \"Heber C. Kimball\" in Daniel H. Ludlow, ed., ''Selections from the Encyclopedia of Mormonism: Church History'', p. 268</ref> There the church founded the city of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and built [[Nauvoo Temple|a temple]].\n\nIn September 1839, Kimball left Nauvoo for another mission to England.<ref>Whitney, ''Kimball'' p. 265</ref> He did not reach Indiana until October.  He made stops at Kirtland to encourage the remaining Saints there to move to Nauvoo and other places and had a long layover in New York City.<ref>Whitney, ''Kimball'', p. 271-275</ref>  He sailed from New York on December 19, reaching Liverpool on April 6.  Kimball spent 1840 and some of 1841 in England, initially in the area in and around Preston, and later working as a missionary in London.<ref>Whitney, ''Kimball'', p. 287</ref>  The missionaries began organizing groups of British converts to travel to the United States, beginning in 1840, and to join the main body of the church.\n\nAfter [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith was killed]] in 1844, succession to the leadership of the church was a divisive issue. Young led the majority of church members across the state line into Iowa and eventually to the [[Salt Lake Valley]]. Kimball stood next in leadership in the Quorum to Young.\n\n==First Presidency==\nKimball became a member of the new [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] in 1847. Kimball led one of three large companies to the Salt Lake Valley in the summer of 1848.<ref>Kimball, \"Kimball\", ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'', p. 269</ref>\n\nHe established his families in [[Utah Territory]] (he had three wives) and supported them by farming, ranching, milling at the [[Heber C. Kimball Gristmill]] and freighting, in addition to church responsibilities.\n\nWhile in the First Presidency, Kimball received special assignments to supervise the ongoing British Mission and to conduct temple ordinances.<ref>Kimball, \"Kimball\", ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'', p. 270</ref>  He also worked to encourage economic independence for Utah.<ref>Stanley Kimball, ''Kimball'', ''Encyclopedia of LDS Church History'', p. 607</ref>  He had one slave, [[Green Flake]], who was given to the church for [[Tithing (Latter Day Saints)|tithing]], whom he used as his personal driver.<ref name=new_wilderness>{{cite news|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/news/ci_6783958|title=Utah settlers' black slaves caught in 'new wilderness'|author=Kristen Rogers-Iversen|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=September 2, 2007}}</ref><ref name=Williams>{{cite book|title=Slavery in Utah Territory: 1847-1865|author=Don B.

He was buried in the [[Kimball-Whitney Cemetery]] (40.772949, -111.889755), located on the south slope of what's now known as [[Capitol Hill (Salt Lake City)|Capitol Hill]], an area then called \"Heber's Bench\" after him.\n\n==Family==\nKimball received private instruction from Joseph Smith on [[plural marriage]] (polygamy). Initially reluctant{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}, Kimball accepted the responsibility and married a second wife, Sarah Noon. His first wife, Vilate Murray Kimball, accepted plural marriage and welcomed the additional wives as sisters. Heber and Vilate agreed and gave their 14-year-old daughter Helen Marr as a plural wife of Joseph Smith. Kimball considered the marrying of multiple wives an expression of his faith in and obedience to God: \"I have noticed that a man who has but one wife, and is inclined to that doctrine, soon begins to wither and dry up, while a man who goes into plurality [of wives] looks fresh, young, and sprightly. Why is this? Because God loves that man, and because he honors His work and word.\"<ref>''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' vol. 5, p.&nbsp;22.</ref>\n\n===Wives and children===\n[[File:117 MSS P 24 B2 F1.jpg|thumb|Heber C.

Kimball (1801-1868) {{!}} FamilySearch|website=ancestors.familysearch.org|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref> was a leader in the early [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. He served as one of the original twelve [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]] in the early [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of the Latter Day Saints]], and as first counselor to [[Brigham Young]] in the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) for more than two decades, from 1847 until his death.\n\nAgreeing to take on [[plural marriage]], then part of church doctrine, Kimball eventually married forty-three women, but some relationships were for caretaking. He had a total of sixty-six children by seventeen of his wives.\n\n==Early life==\nHeber Chase Kimball was born in [[Sheldon, Vermont|Sheldon]], [[Franklin County, Vermont]] in 1801. He was a descendant of the Kimball immigrants to Massachusetts from England in 1634. He was named after a judge Heber Chase, who had helped the family in their efforts to settle in the area. Due to the embargo on trade with Britain preceding the [[War of 1812]], his father lost his investments and the family moved into western New York. They settled in [[West Bloomfield, New York]], [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]], around 1811.\n\n===Education and training===\nKimball left school at age 14, trained as a blacksmith and potter, and moved with his brother about 1820 to [[Mendon, New York|Mendon]], [[Monroe County, New York]]. There he married his first wife, Vilate Murray, in 1822.\n\nAfter purchasing his brother's [[pottery]] business, for the next 10 years, he carried out his trades. He acquired five and a half acres (22,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) of land, built a house and a barn, and planted an orchard.\n\n===Masonry===\n{{see also|Mormonism and Freemasonry}}\nIn 1823, Kimball received the three craft degrees of [[Freemason]]ry in the lodge at [[Victor Flats, New York|Victor Flats]], [[Ontario County, New York]]. In 1824, he sent a petition to the chapter at [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua, New York]], to receive the [[York Rite]] degrees of Royal Arch Masonry. His petition was accepted, although, as he reported, [[Anti-Masons]] had burned down the chapter building in Canandaigua. Many years later, Kimball reminisced of his New York masonic experiences and stated: \"I wish that all men were masons and would live up to their profession, then the world would be in a much better state than it is now.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitney|first=Orson F.|title=Life of Heber C. Kimball: Apostle, Father and Founder of the British Mission|year=1888|publisher=Kimball Family|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|page=27|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jdkRAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&authuser=0&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA27}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] established itself in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], Kimball was one of the original petitioners to establish a Freemasonry lodge there. He served as Nauvoo Lodge U.D.'s first Junior Deacon. He remained active in Freemasonry throughout his stay in Nauvoo, but was not active once he moved to [[Utah Territory]]. There was no lodge in Utah in his lifetime that would admit Mormons.<ref>The first time Mormons were admitted to the Freemasons in Utah was 1984. State lodges excluded even those persons who had previously been admitted to other lodges prior to the [[Mormon Exodus]] to the west. <br/>See: {{citation |url= http://www.fairlds.org/fair-conferences/2005-fair-conference/2005-the-message-and-the-messenger-latter-day-saints-and-freemasonry |title= The Message and the Messenger: Latter-day Saints and Freemasonry |first= Greg |last= Kearney |year= 2005 |work= 2005 FAIR Conference |publisher= [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] }};<br/> {{citation |url= http://www.wasatchlodge.org/publish/lodge-history/ |title= The Lodge: Brief History of Wasatch Lodge |work= WasatchLodge.org |publisher= Wasatch Lodge #1 Free & Accepted Masons }}.</ref>\n\n===Early family life===\nSeveral of Kimball's close family members died of [[tuberculosis]] within a few years: his mother in February 1824, his father in the spring of 1826, followed by his brother Charles C. and his brother's wife shortly thereafter.\n\nHis son [[William Henry Kimball|William Henry]] was born in Mendon, April 10, 1826; he was Kimball's first child to survive infancy. His daughter [[Helen Mar Kimball|Helen Mar]] was born August 22, 1828. She was the only daughter to survive.\n\n===Signs in the heavens===\nKimball claims to have witnessed a miraculous event on September 22, 1827. According to his autobiography, he subsequently learned that it \"took place the same evening that [[Joseph Smith]] received the records of the Book of Mormon from the [[Angel Moroni]].\" He had seen \"a white smoke\" arising on the horizon, growing \"clear and transparent of a bluish cast\" to reveal an army on the move \"in platoons\":\n\n<blockquote>We could see distinctly the muskets, bayonets, and knapsacks of the men, who wore caps and feathers like those used by the American soldiers in the last war with Britain; also their officers with their swords and equipage, and heard the clashing and jingling of their instruments of war and could discover the form and features of the men. The most profound order existed throughout the entire army, when the foremost man stepped, every man stepped at the same time: I could hear the step. When the front rank reached the Western horizon a battle ensued, as we could distinctly hear the report of the arms and the rush. No man could judge of my feelings when I beheld that army of men, as plainly as I ever saw armies of men in the flesh it seemed as though every hair of my head was alive. This scenery was gazed upon for hours, until it began to disappear.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Latter-day Saints Millennial Star|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xy8EAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA472|year=1864|page=472}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Joining the Latter Day Saint movement==\nWhile in New York, Kimball joined the local [[Baptist Church]] and was eventually baptized. Three weeks later, three elders from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], the original name of the [[Latter Day Saint]] church founded by [[Joseph Smith]], visited the house of his friend, [[Phineas Young]]. Kimball visited the house at this time and was impressed with church teachings. He also witnessed the speaking of tongues and the interpretation of tongues during this visit. He claims to have been visited by the power of God.\n\nDuring this time, Kimball said that he and several of the Young family saw a vision opened of the \"gathering of the Saints to Zion.\" He was inspired to travel to Pennsylvania where he could visit at length with the elders, and was accompanied by some of the Youngs. They stayed six days with the elders and witnessed more miracles, such as [[Glossolalia|speaking in tongues]] and the interpretation of tongues.\n\nOn April 16, 1832 Kimball was baptized by Alpheus Gifford.<ref>Orson F. Whitney, ''The Life of Heber C. Kimball'' (Salt Lake City, Bookcraft, 1945) p. 21-22</ref>  After the confirmation, the elder offered to ordain Kimball to the priesthood, but Kimball refused it as he felt he was unready. Thirty more people were baptized in Mendon and formed a branch of the church there.\n\nAbout this time, people began calling Kimball \"crazy,\" although he claims he was \"clothed in the right mind.\" He claims the scriptures unfolded for him. Local clergy and members of other faiths soon became antagonistic towards the small Latter-day Saint branch and its members. Kimball had several people make executions on his property to recall considerable debts, which he was nevertheless able to pay off in full.<!--What does this mean - \"executions on his property\"? sounds like a dated term  -->\n\n==Church service==\nShortly after his baptism, Kimball was ordained an elder by [[Joseph Young]]. He began proselyting in the neighboring areas with Joseph and [[Brigham Young]]. This part of New York became known as the \"burnt over district\" because of the numerous religious sects that sprang up during the 19th century. The Youngs baptized many people and built up branches of the church. Kimball said that one day Ezra Landon baptized some 20 people but wanted him to confirm them. He did so, and immediately they began speaking in tongues and interpreting them.\n\nIn 1833, Kimball relocated his family to church headquarters in [[Kirtland, Ohio]]. He marched with [[Zion's Camp]] in 1834. From 1832 until 1840, Kimball served eight missions for the Church, requiring him to be apart from his family for months at a time.<ref>Stanley B.

Cowan, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of LDS Church History'', p. 607</ref>\n\n==Quorum of the Twelve==\nOn February 14, 1835, Kimball was ordained a member of [[The Quorum of Twelve Apostles]] of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of the Latter Day Saints]] (renamed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints<!-- Do not change this name to \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\".

He was one of the original twelve members of the Quorum, being 4th in seniority.\n\n[[Joseph Smith]] called Kimball to lead a group of missionaries to England in 1837. The mission began work in [[Preston, Lancashire]], England.<ref>Whitney, ''Kimball'', p. 121</ref> After the initial baptisms in Preston, the missionaries expanded their efforts to the Ribble Valley. By the time Kimball departed for the United States in 1838, about 1,500 people had been baptized.<ref>David J. Whitaker and James R.

He made stops at Kirtland to encourage the remaining Saints there to move to Nauvoo and other places and had a long layover in New York City.<ref>Whitney, ''Kimball'', p. 271-275</ref>  He sailed from New York on December 19, reaching Liverpool on April 6.  Kimball spent 1840 and some of 1841 in England, initially in the area in and around Preston, and later working as a missionary in London.<ref>Whitney, ''Kimball'', p. 287</ref>  The missionaries began organizing groups of British converts to travel to the United States, beginning in 1840, and to join the main body of the church.\n\nAfter [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith was killed]] in 1844, succession to the leadership of the church was a divisive issue. Young led the majority of church members across the state line into Iowa and eventually to the [[Salt Lake Valley]]. Kimball stood next in leadership in the Quorum to Young.\n\n==First Presidency==\nKimball became a member of the new [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] in 1847. Kimball led one of three large companies to the Salt Lake Valley in the summer of 1848.<ref>Kimball, \"Kimball\", ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'', p. 269</ref>\n\nHe established his families in [[Utah Territory]] (he had three wives) and supported them by farming, ranching, milling at the [[Heber C. Kimball Gristmill]] and freighting, in addition to church responsibilities.\n\nWhile in the First Presidency, Kimball received special assignments to supervise the ongoing British Mission and to conduct temple ordinances.<ref>Kimball, \"Kimball\", ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'', p. 270</ref>  He also worked to encourage economic independence for Utah.<ref>Stanley Kimball, ''Kimball'', ''Encyclopedia of LDS Church History'', p. 607</ref>  He had one slave, [[Green Flake]], who was given to the church for [[Tithing (Latter Day Saints)|tithing]], whom he used as his personal driver.<ref name=new_wilderness>{{cite news|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/news/ci_6783958|title=Utah settlers' black slaves caught in 'new wilderness'|author=Kristen Rogers-Iversen|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=September 2, 2007}}</ref><ref name=Williams>{{cite book|title=Slavery in Utah Territory: 1847-1865|author=Don B.

Initially reluctant{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}, Kimball accepted the responsibility and married a second wife, Sarah Noon. His first wife, Vilate Murray Kimball, accepted plural marriage and welcomed the additional wives as sisters. Heber and Vilate agreed and gave their 14-year-old daughter Helen Marr as a plural wife of Joseph Smith. Kimball considered the marrying of multiple wives an expression of his faith in and obedience to God: \"I have noticed that a man who has but one wife, and is inclined to that doctrine, soon begins to wither and dry up, while a man who goes into plurality [of wives] looks fresh, young, and sprightly.

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). The Gendarmerie were involved in fighting the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) and [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) in Northern Katanga at the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1960. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Rum Punch]] (August 1961), [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961) and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1963). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

Approximately 5,000 troops were earmarked for the operation, which focused on a northward offensive from Lubudi. At the same time, they were to recapture the town of [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]], secure the area south of it, and launch attacks on [[Kabalo]] from [[Kalemie|Albertville]] to the east and [[Kongolo, Tanganyika|Kongolo]] to the north.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}} The Katangese Genarmerie subsequently launched operations Banquise, Mambo, and Lotus against the BALUBAKAT rebels.

However, many officers remained, without official Belgian support, or became mercenaries. To support these efforts, Belgium organized hundreds of Europeans to fight with Katanga. There had also been ongoing efforts by the United Nations to suppress Belgian support to the Gendarmerie; 338 mercenaries and 443 political advisers were expelled from the region by August.

His efforts, undermined by the force's low morale and indiscipline, were further hampered by an influx of refugees. Discipline in the garrison increasingly faltered; in once instance, two mercenaries attempted to steal Puren's jeep. Tshombe ordered the Katangese garrison of [[Baudouinville]] to surrender to besieging UN and ANC forces. Instead, they and most of the population deserted the city while a handful of gendarmes near [[Kongolo, Katanga|Kongolo]] laid down their arms to Nigerian and Malaysian soldiers. On 14 January, Indian troops found the last intact bridge into Kolwezi. After a brief fight with gendarmes and mercenaries they secured it and crossed over, stopping at the city outskirts to await further instruction.<ref name=\"othen\" /> At a final meeting with his mercenary commanders, Tshombe ordered all remaining Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. [[Jean Schramme]] was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate what remained of the Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country.

Those who integrated suffered threats and violence, and were given lower ranks. An estimated 7,000 returned to civilian life, and a further 8,000 escaped disarmament. Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963.

Portuguese colonial authorities, eager to assist the anticommunist Katangese, organised them in \"refugee\" camps. By 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities.

A [[Stanleyville mutinies#Second mutiny|second wave of mutinies]] broke out on July 5, 1967 in [[Bukavu]] and [[Kisangani]], after Tshombe's plane was hijacked and he was detained in [[Algiers]]. The mutinies were led by European mercenaries. An estimated 600 former gendarmes, led by Belgian mercenary [[Jean Schramme]] were present in Kisangani during the mutiny. Under pressure from the ANC, Schramme was forced to evacuate the city with 300 mercenaries and a few thousand gendarmes.

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). The Gendarmerie were involved in fighting the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) and [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) in Northern Katanga at the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1960. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Rum Punch]] (August 1961), [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961) and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1963). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

{"title_page": "Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=May 2013}}\n{{howto|date=April 2013}}\n}}\n\n{{Cuisine of China}}\n\n'''Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining''' are the traditional behaviors observed while eating in [[Greater China]]. Traditional [[Han Chinese|Han]] customs have spread throughout [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asia]] to varying degrees, with some regions sharing a few aspects of formal dining, which has ranged from guest seating to paying the bill.\n\n==Table and place settings==\n[[File:HK Sai Ying Pun \u540d\u661f\u6d77\u9bae\u9152\u5bb6 Star Seafood Restaurant round table March-2012 Ip4.jpg|thumb|right|Typical place settings before a meal is served]]\nIn most traditional Chinese dining, dishes are shared [[Communal bowl|communally]]. Although both square and rectangular tables are used for small groups of people, round tables are preferred for large groups, particularly in restaurants, in order to permit easy sharing. [[Lazy Susan]] turntables are a common feature at the center of larger tables, to facilitate passing of serving dishes. \n\nA basic [[place setting]] consists of a small teacup; a large plate with a small, empty rice bowl; a set of chopsticks, usually on the right of the plate; and a soup spoon. Additions may include a chopstick rest or holder, a large water or wine glass, and a smaller glass for ''[[baijiu]]''. Occasionally a small shallow dish is left for each diner, to hold a small amount of a condiment or sauce.\n\nAt homes and low-end restaurants, napkins may consist of [[Tissue paper|paper tissues]] or occasionally must be provided by the diner. High restaurants often provide cloth napkins similar to Western dining as part of the place settings.\n\nUnlike some Western restaurants, powdered salt, pepper, or sugar are rarely provided at the table. Sometimes bottles of soy sauce, vinegar, hot sauce, or other condiments are available.[[Black vinegar]] is popular in the north of China as a dipping sauce, particularly for dumplings.<ref>{{Citation|title=Black vinegar|date=2020-04-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_vinegar&oldid=950867267|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Formal seating order ===\nThere is a specific [[Seating plan|seating order]] to every [[formal dinner]], based on seniority and organizational hierarchy. The [[seat of honor]], reserved for the host or the oldest person, is usually the position in the center facing east or facing the entrance to the room. Guests with higher status then sit in close proximity to the seat of honor, while those with lower positions sit further away. The least pretigious seat is generally the one nearest to the kitchen entrance or service door.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internations.org/hong-kong-expats/guide/15908-culture-shopping-recreation/dining-in-hong-kong-etiquette-15914|title=Dining in Hong Kong: Etiquette|website=www.internations.org}}</ref>In a formal banquet hall of many tables, the main table is the one which situates furthest from the entrance. The tables on the left hand side of the main tables are, in order of importance, second, fourth, sixth and so on, and those on the right are third, fifth and seventh. Guests are seated according to their status and cohesion with the host of the banquet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cits.net/china-travel-guide/seating-arrangements-of-chinese-banquet.html|title=Seating Arrangements of Chinese Banquet - CITS|website=www.cits.net|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==Sequencing of a meal==\nWide variations exist throughout China, but the vast majority of full-course dinners are very similar in terms of timing and dishes.\n\n===Beverages===\n[[File:Chinese teapot.JPG|thumb|right|An 18th century Chinese porcelain hand painted blue and white teapot]]\nHot tea is almost always provided, either in advance of the diners being seated or immediately afterward. It can be consumed at leisure throughout the meal. Hot or cold water is sometimes served, but tea is the default beverage. A verbal \"thank you\" ({{zh|s=\u8c22\u8c22|p=xiexie|labels=no}}) may be offered to the server pouring a refill or, if in the middle of a conversation where it would be rude to interrupt the speaker, the table may be [[Chinese tea culture#Finger tapping|tapped twice with two bent fingers]] instead. Never pour a full cup of tea in China. Like wines in Western culture, tea in China is more of a sense and concept than taste.Fill about 70 percent of a cup with tea, as the other 30 percent is space for your emotions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnn.com/food/beverages/photos/perfect-cup-tea-around-globe/tea-tour|title=The perfect cup of tea around the globe|website=MNN - Mother Nature Network|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=The Classic of Tea|date=2020-03-18|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Classic_of_Tea&oldid=946205032|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n===Appetizers===\nAppetizers are the first items presented. Two or more small dishes are brought to the table, holding boiled unsalted peanuts, salted roasted peanuts, crispy fried noodles, or similar dishes. These may be consumed while ordering the main courses, or while waiting for other dishes to arrive.\n\n===Soup===\nA hot soup may be served as one of the dishes, usually near the beginning of the meal. For small meals, especially at home, it may replace the diners' beverage entirely.\n\n===Main courses===\n{{see also|Dim sum}}\nUnlike Western-style meals, there are usually multiple main dishes which are sampled by all the diners; usually there is one communally-shared dish ordered per person seated at a table. A celebratory event such as a graduation or wedding often features over ten dishes, often an odd number for good luck.\n \nWhite steamed rice is provided in small bowls and food is often placed over it, flavoring it with their sauces. The rice is consumed little by little along with the other dishes and not separately, unless the diner remains hungry after the last dish has been removed.\n\n===Final course===\nNear the end of the meal, a starchy, filling dish such as noodles, [[jiaozi|Chinese dumplings]], or ''[[baozi]]'' is sometimes served, to ensure that guests are fully satiated. In extremely formal settings, only a small amount of this final dish is taken by the diners, to avoid implying that the host was not sufficiently generous in planning the meal.\n\n===Dessert===\nInformal meals may not have a dessert course at all, or offer sweet foods that are particular favorites of the diners. Fresh fruit (often slices of citrus) or fresh or canned pineapple are often offered in restaurants.\n\nOther common desserts are [[tapioca]] or [[rice pudding]], or a hot or cold soup flavored with [[red bean soup|sweet red beans]]. Ice cream may be offered, often flavored with [[ginger]], [[Red bean ice|sweet red beans]], or a delicate tea.\n\n[[Fortune cookie]]s are rarely offered by authentic Chinese restaurants, even in North America where they were invented. They are considered a lightweight amusement, suitable for informal gatherings of close friends and family. Fancier restaurants may offer mints or occasionally chocolates as breath fresheners.\n\n==Manners and customs ==\nEating is a dominant aspect of [[Chinese culture]], and eating out is one of the most common ways to honor guests, socialize, and deepen friendships.<ref name=\"Dob\">Dobsons, Richard. ''China Cycle'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=1HwBFSfy_f0C&pg=RA1-PA20 p. 20]. 2006. 8 Feb 2010.</ref>\n\nProper [[etiquette]] is very important to traditional Chinese people, who feel good manners invite [[luck]], but boorish conduct brings [[shame]]. Although many [[Mao Zedong|Maoist]] programs tried to curtail traditional social practices, today table etiquette is again taken as an indication of educational status and good upbringing. For example, a child misusing their chopsticks at a formal dinner might embarrass their family, who are responsible for teaching the child.<ref name=\"Dob\"/><ref name=\"Cha\"/>\n\n===Personal behavior===\n{{See also|Eating utensil etiquette}}\nSince [[chopsticks]] (and [[spoon]]s) are used in place of [[fork]]s and [[knives]], [[Chinese cuisine]] tends to serve dishes in bite-size pieces or employ cooking techniques that render dishes such as fish or ''[[hong shao rou]]'' soft enough to be picked apart easily.<ref name=\"Inn\">Inness, Sherrie. \"Home Cooking .\" Kitchen Culture in America: Popular Representations of Food, Gender, and Race (2001): 14.

One should not spear food with chopsticks although people sometimes do it if the food is too slippery. Chopsticks are not to be used to point at people, pick teeth, bang the bowls, move the bowls, nor to be chewed on or waved around. They should be held so that the ends are even, and never separated in any way (such as holding one in each hand). \n\nWhen not in use, chopsticks should be left on chopstick rests when provided, or placed across the bowl or plate.

In addition to providing opportunities for socializing, shared meals allow the diners to sample a wider range of dishes than if they were ordering individually.\n\n===Communal eating===\n[[File:Spoon and chopsticks.jpg|thumb|upright|Serving chopsticks (''gongkuai'') on the far right, personal chopsticks (''putongkuai'' or ''sikuai'') in the middle, and a spoon.

The shunned practice is sometimes called \"digging one's grave\". Likewise, it is impolite to hoard or take most of a dish until it has been offered to everyone and the other diners have had a chance to sample it. For this reason, it is common to take a smaller amount from the dishes on the first round, and to keep the other diners in mind when taking a larger second helping.\n\nThe last piece of food on a communal dish is never served to oneself without asking for permission.

A Lazy Susan can be made from many materials, but most often they are constructed of glass, wood, or plastic.\n\nIt is typical for all the dishes for each course to be brought out together and placed around the perimeter of the Lazy Susan. It the turntable is large, a decorative centerpiece may occupy the center, since any food placed there would be out of reach of a seated diner. Alternatively, shared table condiments such as soy sauce, hot sauce, vinegar, or sesame oil may be located at the center.\n\nIf the dishes come out one at a time or if there is some special delicacy, they are typically served to the guest of honor first and then rotated clockwise around the table. The host will often wait to serve himself last. Dishes should typically not be removed from the Lazy Susan and placed on the table: at most, one should hold the dish aloft while serving and then return it to its place on the tray. One should try to avoid moving the Lazy Susan even slightly when someone is in the act of transferring food from the dishes to their plate or bowl. \n\n===Alcohol===\nWater and other non-alcoholic beverages may be consumed at any time. However, in formal settings, alcohol should only be consumed during [[toast (honor)|toasts]]. A modest toast may be followed by a single sip of wine or swallow of beer, but a ''baijiu'' toast is often ended with ''Ganbei!'' ({{lang|zh|\u5e72\u676f}}), an exhortation to drain the glass. Ideally, glasses are refilled immediately following a toast in preparation for the next.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn informal settings, individuals may order their preferred drinks. Carbonated beverages or beer are often ordered, although many diners may be satisfied with tea or hot water.\n\n==Bill (check)==\nThe bill for the meal (often call the \"check\") is presented at the end of the meal, after all the food and drinks have been served. In most restaurants in Chinese countries, there is no [[gratuity|tip]] expected unless it is explicitly posted. Usually if there is a tip required, it will already be added to the bill. However, in Chinese restaurants in North America tips are usually expected, as is customary in other restaurants of the region.\n\nIt is a common sight for families to dispute over who pays the bill, as the person paying thereby demonstrates generosity, sincerity, and dominance. If somebody organizes a meal and invites the guests, that person is usually accorded the honor of paying for the event.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Customs and etiquette in Japanese dining]]\n*[[Chinese culture|Culture of China]]\n*[[Chinese cuisine]]\n*[[Etiquette in Asia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n<!--\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&pg=PA109&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 8]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&pg=PA109&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 9]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=0TV8ebayzNUC&pg=PA26&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 10]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=npxUXbUg6uUC&pg=PA164&dq=chopstick+manners&hl=en#v=onepage&q=chopsticks&f=false Ref. 11 page 164]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=32uyAAAAIAAJ&q=chopstick+etiquette&dq=chopstick+etiquette&hl=en Ref. 12 page 69-71]\n-->\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/business/global/28iht-busnav28.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss In China, Social Evenings Are Considered Part of the Business Routine]\n* [https://ac.els-cdn.com/S2352618115000657/1-s2.0-S2352618115000657-main.pdf?_tid=698dab50-0114-4938-a7f6-58bddca2b29a&acdnat=1528346775_0fcf187161655a2b6fe6aeb18defa85f Food, eating behavior, and culture in Chinese society]\n* [http://confuciusmag.com/chinese-dining-etiquette Chinese dining etiquette]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chinese Table Manner}}\n[[Category:Etiquette by region|Chinese dining]]\n[[Category:Dining etiquette]]\n[[Category:Chinese cuisine]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=May 2013}}\n{{howto|date=April 2013}}\n}}\n\n{{Cuisine of China}}\n\n'''Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining''' are the traditional behaviors observed while eating in [[Greater China]]. Traditional [[Han Chinese|Han]] customs have spread throughout [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asia]] to varying degrees, with some regions sharing a few aspects of formal dining, which has ranged from guest seating to paying the bill.\n\n==Table and place settings==\n[[File:HK Sai Ying Pun \u540d\u661f\u6d77\u9bae\u9152\u5bb6 Star Seafood Restaurant round table March-2012 Ip4.jpg|thumb|right|Typical place settings before a meal is served]]\nIn most traditional Chinese dining, dishes are shared [[Communal bowl|communally]]. Although both square and rectangular tables are used for small groups of people, round tables are preferred for large groups, particularly in restaurants, in order to permit easy sharing. [[Lazy Susan]] turntables are a common feature at the center of larger tables, to facilitate passing of serving dishes. \n\nA basic [[place setting]] consists of a small teacup; a large plate with a small, empty rice bowl; a set of chopsticks, usually on the right of the plate; and a soup spoon. Additions may include a chopstick rest or holder, a large water or wine glass, and a smaller glass for ''[[baijiu]]''. Occasionally a small shallow dish is left for each diner, to hold a small amount of a condiment or sauce.\n\nAt homes and low-end restaurants, napkins may consist of [[Tissue paper|paper tissues]] or occasionally must be provided by the diner. High restaurants often provide cloth napkins similar to Western dining as part of the place settings.\n\nUnlike some Western restaurants, powdered salt, pepper, or sugar are rarely provided at the table. Sometimes bottles of soy sauce, vinegar, hot sauce, or other condiments are available.[[Black vinegar]] is popular in the north of China as a dipping sauce, particularly for dumplings.<ref>{{Citation|title=Black vinegar|date=2020-04-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_vinegar&oldid=950867267|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Formal seating order ===\nThere is a specific [[Seating plan|seating order]] to every [[formal dinner]], based on seniority and organizational hierarchy. The [[seat of honor]], reserved for the host or the oldest person, is usually the position in the center facing east or facing the entrance to the room. Guests with higher status then sit in close proximity to the seat of honor, while those with lower positions sit further away. The least pretigious seat is generally the one nearest to the kitchen entrance or service door.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internations.org/hong-kong-expats/guide/15908-culture-shopping-recreation/dining-in-hong-kong-etiquette-15914|title=Dining in Hong Kong: Etiquette|website=www.internations.org}}</ref>In a formal banquet hall of many tables, the main table is the one which situates furthest from the entrance. The tables on the left hand side of the main tables are, in order of importance, second, fourth, sixth and so on, and those on the right are third, fifth and seventh. Guests are seated according to their status and cohesion with the host of the banquet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cits.net/china-travel-guide/seating-arrangements-of-chinese-banquet.html|title=Seating Arrangements of Chinese Banquet - CITS|website=www.cits.net|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==Sequencing of a meal==\nWide variations exist throughout China, but the vast majority of full-course dinners are very similar in terms of timing and dishes.\n\n===Beverages===\n[[File:Chinese teapot.JPG|thumb|right|An 18th century Chinese porcelain hand painted blue and white teapot]]\nHot tea is almost always provided, either in advance of the diners being seated or immediately afterward. It can be consumed at leisure throughout the meal. Hot or cold water is sometimes served, but tea is the default beverage. A verbal \"thank you\" ({{zh|s=\u8c22\u8c22|p=xiexie|labels=no}}) may be offered to the server pouring a refill or, if in the middle of a conversation where it would be rude to interrupt the speaker, the table may be [[Chinese tea culture#Finger tapping|tapped twice with two bent fingers]] instead. Never pour a full cup of tea in China. Like wines in Western culture, tea in China is more of a sense and concept than taste.Fill about 70 percent of a cup with tea, as the other 30 percent is space for your emotions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnn.com/food/beverages/photos/perfect-cup-tea-around-globe/tea-tour|title=The perfect cup of tea around the globe|website=MNN - Mother Nature Network|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n===Appetizers===\nAppetizers are the first items presented. Two or more small dishes are brought to the table, holding boiled unsalted peanuts, salted roasted peanuts, crispy fried noodles, or similar dishes. These may be consumed while ordering the main courses, or while waiting for other dishes to arrive.\n\n===Soup===\nA hot soup may be served as one of the dishes, usually near the beginning of the meal. For small meals, especially at home, it may replace the diners' beverage entirely.\n\n===Main courses===\n{{see also|Dim sum}}\nUnlike Western-style meals, there are usually multiple main dishes which are sampled by all the diners; usually there is one communally-shared dish ordered per person seated at a table. A celebratory event such as a graduation or wedding often features over ten dishes, often an odd number for good luck.\n \nWhite steamed rice is provided in small bowls and food is often placed over it, flavoring it with their sauces. The rice is consumed little by little along with the other dishes and not separately, unless the diner remains hungry after the last dish has been removed.\n\n===Final course===\nNear the end of the meal, a starchy, filling dish such as noodles, [[jiaozi|Chinese dumplings]], or ''[[baozi]]'' is sometimes served, to ensure that guests are fully satiated. In extremely formal settings, only a small amount of this final dish is taken by the diners, to avoid implying that the host was not sufficiently generous in planning the meal.\n\n===Dessert===\nInformal meals may not have a dessert course at all, or offer sweet foods that are particular favorites of the diners. Fresh fruit (often slices of citrus) or fresh or canned pineapple are often offered in restaurants.\n\nOther common desserts are [[tapioca]] or [[rice pudding]], or a hot or cold soup flavored with [[red bean soup|sweet red beans]]. Ice cream may be offered, often flavored with [[ginger]], [[Red bean ice|sweet red beans]], or a delicate tea.\n\n[[Fortune cookie]]s are rarely offered by authentic Chinese restaurants, even in North America where they were invented. They are considered a lightweight amusement, suitable for informal gatherings of close friends and family. Fancier restaurants may offer mints or occasionally chocolates as breath fresheners.\n\n==Manners and customs ==\nEating is a dominant aspect of [[Chinese culture]], and eating out is one of the most common ways to honor guests, socialize, and deepen friendships.<ref name=\"Dob\">Dobsons, Richard.

Although many [[Mao Zedong|Maoist]] programs tried to curtail traditional social practices, today table etiquette is again taken as an indication of educational status and good upbringing. For example, a child misusing their chopsticks at a formal dinner might embarrass their family, who are responsible for teaching the child.<ref name=\"Dob\"/><ref name=\"Cha\"/>\n\n===Personal behavior===\n{{See also|Eating utensil etiquette}}\nSince [[chopsticks]] (and [[spoon]]s) are used in place of [[fork]]s and [[knives]], [[Chinese cuisine]] tends to serve dishes in bite-size pieces or employ cooking techniques that render dishes such as fish or ''[[hong shao rou]]'' soft enough to be picked apart easily.<ref name=\"Inn\">Inness, Sherrie. \"Home Cooking .\" Kitchen Culture in America: Popular Representations of Food, Gender, and Race (2001): 14.

If somebody organizes a meal and invites the guests, that person is usually accorded the honor of paying for the event.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Customs and etiquette in Japanese dining]]\n*[[Chinese culture|Culture of China]]\n*[[Chinese cuisine]]\n*[[Etiquette in Asia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n<!--\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&pg=PA109&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 8]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&pg=PA109&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 9]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=0TV8ebayzNUC&pg=PA26&dq=chinese+table+manners&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=chinese%20table%20manners&f=false Ref. 10]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=npxUXbUg6uUC&pg=PA164&dq=chopstick+manners&hl=en#v=onepage&q=chopsticks&f=false Ref. 11 page 164]\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=32uyAAAAIAAJ&q=chopstick+etiquette&dq=chopstick+etiquette&hl=en Ref. 12 page 69-71]\n-->\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/business/global/28iht-busnav28.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss In China, Social Evenings Are Considered Part of the Business Routine]\n* [https://ac.els-cdn.com/S2352618115000657/1-s2.0-S2352618115000657-main.pdf?_tid=698dab50-0114-4938-a7f6-58bddca2b29a&acdnat=1528346775_0fcf187161655a2b6fe6aeb18defa85f Food, eating behavior, and culture in Chinese society]\n* [http://confuciusmag.com/chinese-dining-etiquette Chinese dining etiquette]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chinese Table Manner}}\n[[Category:Etiquette by region|Chinese dining]]\n[[Category:Dining etiquette]]\n[[Category:Chinese cuisine]]\n", "name_user": "Punkpumpking", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBeverages:adding a Chinese ancient book talking about the concept and culture of tea", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_and_etiquette_in_Chinese_dining"}

Released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in November 1998, it is the third game in [[The Settlers|''The Settlers'' series]], following ''[[The Settlers (video game)|The Settlers]]'' (1993) and ''[[The Settlers II]]'' (1996). In April 1999, Blue Byte released an [[Expansion pack|expansion]], ''The Settlers III Mission CD'', featuring new [[Single-player video game|single-player]] campaign missions, new maps for both single-player and [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] modes, and a [[Level (video games)#Level editor|map editor]]. In October, they released a second expansion, ''The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons'' ({{lang-de|Die Siedler III: Das Geheimnis der Amazonen}}), containing two new single-player campaigns, additional single-player and multiplayer maps, and an enhanced editor. In June 2000, ''The Settlers III: Gold Edition'' was released, containing the original game and both expansions, plus fan-made maps for single-player and multiplayer modes, a new Easy difficulty setting for single-player games, [[HTML]] hints and tips, and minor [[Video game graphics|graphical]] enhancements and [[gameplay]] tweaks. In 2013, the ''Gold Edition'' was released on [[GOG.com]] under its North American title, ''The Settlers III: Ultimate Collection'', and in 2018, it was re-released as ''The Settlers III: History Edition''.\n\nIn the game's single-player campaign, the player controls one of three races ([[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] or [[Xia dynasty|Asians]]) whose respective deities are summoned by the great god HE, after HE becomes dissatisfied with how the lesser gods are ruling. HE tells them they must each pick a champion from among their people, and have him lead a war against the other peoples, with the gods of the two losing races facing an arduous and absurd punishment. ''Quest of the Amazons'' tells a prequel story, chronicling how [[Helios]]'s daughter, Q'nq\u00fcra, becomes HIS personal assistant, engineering events so that women become the secret rulers of the universe. ''Quest'' allows the player to choose from one of two campaigns; either controlling the [[Amazons]] against the other three races, or controlling the combined forces of the others against the Amazons.\n\nThe game was [[Video game design#Game designer|designed]] and co-[[Video game programmer|programmed]] by Volker Wertich, creator of the original ''Settlers'' game. Having consulted fan feedback from the first two games, Wertich wanted to expand the scope of the third installment as much as possible, whilst preserving the elements which made the series unique. Although the core [[supply and demand]]-based gameplay is broadly the same as in previous titles, many of the [[game mechanics]] have been altered. For example, combat is more involved, with the player given direct control over their army; roads are no longer necessary to connect buildings, as all settlers can now walk freely around the player's territory; headquarters no longer automatically generate settlers as required, instead the player must build residences to gain new settlers; and the different races are no longer merely aesthetically differentiated, they now have different [[economic model]]s, different magic spells, different war machines, and several unique abilities and buildings. The game was also the first in the series to feature online multiplayer, the addition of which had been one of the main requests from fans.\n\n''The Settlers III'' received mixed reviews. Although acclaimed in its native Germany, where it was heralded as the best game in the series thus far, the international reaction was more muted. Whilst the  economic system and the interrelatedness of the various buildings were generally praised, and the graphics and [[Computer animation|animations]] especially lauded, most critics felt it was too similar to previous ''Settlers'' titles, with the changes to the mechanics seen as not enough to fully differentiate it from its predecessors. The game was a commercial success, selling over 200,000 units in Germany within the first twelve months of its release, and ultimately going on to sell over 700,000 units worldwide.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''The Settlers III'' is a [[real-time strategy]] game with [[City-building game|city-building]] elements,<ref name=\"GSpot\"/><ref name=\"Replay\"/><ref name=\"Ars\"/> controlled via a [[point and click]] interface, in which the primary goal on most [[Level (video gaming)|maps]] is to build a settlement with a functioning [[economy]], producing sufficient military units so as to conquer rival territories, ultimately gaining control of either the entire map, or a certain predetermined section of it.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Settlers III Instruction Manual ''(NA)'' | last1=Collins | first1=Dale | last2=Walk | first2=Wolfgang | last3=Harding | first3=Chris | url=http://files.replacementdocs.com/The_Settlers_III_-_Manual_-_PC.pdf | publisher=[[Blue Byte]] | year=1998 | chapter=Getting Started | page=12 | access-date=April 5, 2018 | format=PDF | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405010153/http://files.replacementdocs.com/The_Settlers_III_-_Manual_-_PC.pdf | archive-date=April 5, 2018 | url-status=live}}</ref> To achieve this end, the player must engage in [[Micromanagement (gameplay)|economic micromanagement]], construct buildings, and generate [[resource]]s.<ref name=\"Preview\">{{cite web | url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/settlers-iii-preview/1100-2563217/ | title=''Settlers III'' Preview | website=[[GameSpot]] | last=Dulin | first=Ron | date=November 6, 1998 | access-date=July 24, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707013958/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/settlers-iii-preview/1100-2563217/ | archive-date=July 7, 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Game modes===\nThe game can be played in one of three modes; \"[[Single-player video game|Single Player]]: Scenario\", \"[[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer]]\", or \"Campaign\".<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web | url=https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/02/05/settlers-3 | title=''Settlers 3'' Review | website=[[IGN]] | last=Blevins | first=Tal | date=February 4, 1999 | access-date=June 15, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331105942/https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/02/05/settlers-3 | archive-date=March 31, 2016 | url-status=live}}</ref> In Campaign mode, the player must complete a series of missions, the goal of most of which is to defeat the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|computer controlled]] opponent or opponents by gaining possession of their territory.<ref name=\"Campaign\">{{cite book | title=The Settlers III HTML Manual | last1=Collins | first1=Dale | last2=Liebich | first2=Sven | last3=Walk | first3=Wolfgang | last4=Harding | first4=Chris | publisher=[[Blue Byte]] | year=2000 | chapter=Campaign}}</ref> In the original release of the game, there were three separate campaigns of eight missions each; one campaign each for the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], and [[Xia dynasty|Asians]].

At the encouragement of his friends, Helios is drowning his sorrows, after his son [[Phaethon]] died whilst attempting to use the sun-chariot to impress women, but was unable to control the horses. After becoming drunk, Helios is seduced by [[Medusa]]. Several years later, she is \"killed in a bar fight with [[Perseus]],\" and Helios learns he had fathered a daughter, Q'nq\u00fcra. Raising her himself, Helios introduces her to HE, whom she impresses with her irreverence, and when she is of age, HE makes her goddess of the [[Amazons|Azzi]]. Choosing [[Penthesilea]] as their leader, she awaits as they build up their strength, ready to strike out at the male tribes.\n\n;Amazon Campaign\n\nThe Amazons begin their offensive by destroying a colony of Egyptians, overrunning a Roman encampment, and desecrating a sacred Asian mountain, prompting Jupiter, Horus and Ch'ih-yu to ally.<ref>{{cite video game | title=The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons | developer=[[Blue Byte]] | publisher=[[Blue Byte]] | date=1999 | level=Amazon 4: The Gang Up | quote='''[[Helios]]''': My old friends had finally formed an alliance, preparing to settle things once and for all with a swift and mighty blow.}}</ref> After their initial attacks are repulsed, they are able to disrupt Penthesilea's iron production, hence her ability to create weaponry, forcing the Amazons to retreat to a more fortified position.<ref>{{cite video game | title=The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons | developer=[[Blue Byte]] | publisher=[[Blue Byte]] | date=1999 | level=Amazon 8: Beating a Retreat | quote='''Helios''': Surrounded by Romans, it was only a question of time before her settlement could no longer be held, but Penthesilea did not shrink from battle.

However, Q'nq\u00fcra orders Penthesilea to surround and destroy them.\n\nHE summons Q'nq\u00fcra to ask her what she wants from Jupiter, Horus and Ch'ih-yu. She tells HE, \"Nothing. We don't want men rampaging around like naughty children just because they can't have their way. After all, it's your world they would destroy.\" Her plan is for the \"Amazons to release the men and become their willing servants. Through servitude, we will gain complete control, and the men will be none-the-wiser.\" Impressed with this idea, HE decides to make Q'nq\u00fcra HIS private messenger, to which she replies, \"I will be your humble servant,\" with Helios commenting \"In that moment, Q'nq\u00fcra, too, had won.\"\n\n;3 Gods Campaign\n\nThe game begins with the Romans under attack by the Amazons, and on the brink of defeat. They barely survive, and the Amazons next attack the Asians and Egyptians in turn, prompting Jupiter, Horus and Ch'ih-yu to ally. In the newly renamed 2 Gorgons, they meet to discuss strategy, fully aware that the Gorgons, Q'nq\u00fcra's aunts, are spying on them, and feeding details of their plan to Q'nq\u00fcra. Meanwhile, the men launch an all-out offensive, although Helios is worried that Q'nq\u00fcra's response is too subdued, and she must have a plan. His concerns are ignored, however, as the others assure him that because their enemy is a woman, there is nothing to worry about.<ref>{{cite video game | title=The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons | developer=[[Blue Byte]] | publisher=[[Blue Byte]] | date=1999 | level=3 Gods 10: Onward Men! | quote='''Helios''': My friends had taken to the offensive, but the response of dear Q'nq\u00fcra seemed far too restrained.

Ch'ih-yu, for whom the celebration of victory - with its roast ox - was quite an incentive, set to work immediately. Jupiter, however, sullen at never having wreaked havoc with a glorious deluge, declared that he too had done enough, and in any case certainly more than Horus. Sending an enormous blizzard forth, he cut off his Roman subjects from the outside world, then feigned powerlessness when Ch'ih-yu called for help.}}</ref>\n\nHE summons Q'nq\u00fcra to ask how she was defeated, and she explains that she allowed the men to win. When HE asks why, she explains \"for you. These gods and their peoples are just overgrown children. When they lose, their tantrums destroy, and it's your world they destroy.\" When HE asks her what her future plans are, she explains \"if my Amazons are to deny themselves comparable conquests, then they will embrace the men instead. In this embrace, control will soon be ours, and the men will never know they've lost.\" Impressed with Q'nq\u00fcra's cunning, HE speculates \"you might be just the god I've been looking for.\"\n\n==Development==\n===Concept and design===\nWork on ''The Settlers III'' began in January 1997, prior to the release of ''[[The Settlers II]]: Gold Edition''. Initially, [[Blue Byte]] had no immediate plans to do a third title in the [[The Settlers|series]], but due to the unexpected popularity of both ''[[The Settlers (video game)|The Settlers]]'' and its sequel, Volker Wertich ([[Video game design#Game designer|designer]] and [[Video game programmer|programmer]] of the original) and Thomas Hertzler (Blue Byte [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and the series [[Video game producer|producer]]) decided to begin [[Video game development|development]].<ref name=\"Teil 1 (236)\">{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 1): Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last1=Wertich | first1=Volker | last2=Hess | first2=Torsten | issue=71 | date=August 1998 | page=236 | url=https://ia600305.us.archive.org/19/items/PC.Games.N071.1998.08-fl0n/PC.Games.N071.1998.08-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 15, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref> Wertich had not been involved in the making of the second game, because, as he describes it, \"after two years [[Game programming|programming]] ''The Settlers'', I didn't really want to see those little men for a while.\" However, by 1997, he was ready to resume working on the series, eager to implement ideas which he felt would allow the game to compete with rival titles such as ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness|Warcraft II]]'' and ''[[Anno 1602]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pcgames.de/Die-Siedler-Spiel-21490/Specials/Die-Siedler-Kleine-Maennlein-ganz-gross-Eine-grosse-Serie-im-Rueckblick-Siedler-1-bis-Siedler-4-646822/ | title=''Die Siedler'': Kleine M\u00e4nnlein ganz gro\u00df - Eine gro\u00dfe Serie im R\u00fcckblick (''Siedler 1'' bis ''Siedler 4'') | website=[[PC Games]] | last=Wilke | first=Thomas | date=June 10, 2008 | access-date=February 24, 2017 | language=German}}</ref>\n\nWertich's core [[Video game design|design]] principal was to preserve the most popular elements of the ''Settlers'' [[gameplay]], but improve the [[Video game graphics|graphics]], and both expand and improve upon the [[game mechanics]] as much as possible. He began by going through feedback from fans of the first two games, and quickly saw two recurring suggestions; to improve the unreliable shipping system from ''Settlers II'', and to implement [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]] capabilities, something he began programming immediately.<ref name=\"Teil 1 (236)\"/>\n\nThe first major design decision Wertich made related to the complexity of the game's [[economic system]]. Due to the innovations he planned to introduce to the mechanics, and because the [[supply and demand]]-based gameplay of ''Settlers III'' was going to be more intricate than in previous titles, he felt that forcing players to concentrate too much on logistics would serve as an unwelcome distraction, and so decided to remove the need for a [[Street network|road network]]. Instead, settlers would have the freedom to move anywhere within the player's settlement, with the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] handling [[pathfinding]].<ref name=\"Teil 1 (237)\">{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 1): Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last1=Wertich | first1=Volker | last2=Hess | first2=Torsten | issue=71 | date= August 1998 | page=237 | url=https://ia600305.us.archive.org/19/items/PC.Games.N071.1998.08-fl0n/PC.Games.N071.1998.08-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 15, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref> Another early decision was that the different races in ''Settlers III'' wouldn't just look different, they would have different abilities, different [[economic model]]s and certain buildings unique to each one.<ref name=\"Teil 1 (237)\"/> Wertich, in consultation with Hertzler, also decided to create the game in [[high color]], a first for the series, which had used [[8-bit color]] for previous titles.<ref name=\"Teil 1 (237)\"/>\n\n===Programming and animation===\nWith the basic design concepts in place, Wertich, who had programmed the original game alone, decided that although ''Settlers III'' was a much bigger job, he didn't want to have a large programming team. Instead, he elected to have a two-man team work on the game. As his fellow programmer, he hired Dirk Ringe, who got the job after responding to an advert on a noticeboard in the [[Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz]] looking for \"a [[C++]] programmer for a new [[strategy game]].\"<ref name=\"Teil 1 (237)\"/> Torsten Hess was then hired as the main [[Video game graphics|graphics]] designer/[[Video game artist|artist]]. After making some pencil sketches outlining his basic ideas, Hess began to [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the graphics in [[Autodesk 3ds Max|3D Studio Max]], as Wertich had decided to integrate the [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] graphics of the first two games with certain [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphical elements.<ref name=\"Teil 1 (238)\">{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 1): Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last1=Wertich | first1=Volker | last2=Hess | first2=Torsten | issue=71 | date=August 1998 | page=238 | url=https://ia600305.us.archive.org/19/items/PC.Games.N071.1998.08-fl0n/PC.Games.N071.1998.08-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 15, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nWertich, Ringe and Hess then faced their biggest decision yet; deciding which races to include. After several \"sprawling meetings\", they settled on [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Xia dynasty|Asians]], and Hess began the task of aesthetically differentiating the races.<ref name=\"Teil 1 (238)\"/> In March, a discussion arose about the possibility of including female settlers. However, they decided against it because, as Hess explains, \"we would have had to duplicate all the graphics (male and female), so that every settler could accept all professions.\" As they were unwilling to limit female settlers to certain professions, it was decided to have exclusively male populations, but the concept for having an all-female race remained a possibility for a potential [[Expansion pack|expansion]] in the future.<ref name=\"Teil 1 (238)\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Hess began work on the buildings for each race, creating [[Texture mapping|textures]] in [[Adobe Photoshop]], which he then \"dirtied\", so as to create a lived-in, real-world sense; for example, he ensured the diagonal lines of the [[Egyptian pyramids]] were crooked, as he felt to have them perfectly straight and geometrical would be unrealistic.<ref name=\"Teil 1 (238)\"/> The textures were then \"hand painted\",<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 3): Hausmeister | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last1=Mutschall | first1=Thorsten | last2=Wertich | first2=Volker | last3=Ringe | first3=Dirk | last4=Hess | first4=Torsten | issue=72 | date=September 1998 | page=20 | url=https://ia600307.us.archive.org/16/items/PC.Games.N073.1998.10-fl0n/PC.Games.N073.1998.10-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 18, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref> and [[Gouraud shading]] was later added to complete the look.<ref name=\"PC Games 110\"/>\n\nBy July, Hess had begun working on the sketches for the individual settlers, paying particular attention to the differentiations between the same settler from different races (the specific differences between a Roman and an Egyptian baker, for example). However, it soon became apparent that the workload was too much for one person, and in August a second artist was hired; Thorsten Wallner, who also worked as the game's [[3D modeling]] artist and [[Character animation|character animator]].<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 2): Als die Siedler laufen lernten | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last1=Wertich | first1=Volker | last2=Hess | first2=Torsten | last3=Wallner | first3=Thorsten | issue=72 | date=September 1998 | page=26 | url=https://ia600307.us.archive.org/16/items/PC.Games.N072.1998.09-fl0n/PC.Games.N072.1998.09-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 17, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref> Once on board, Wallner realised that Hess's designs were too detailed, and, as a result, were unrealisable given the current level of technology, so the pair decided to scrap them, and redesign the characters from scratch. Hess had failed to take into account that the designs of the settlers couldn't be too complex, since small details would be lost, given their size (32 [[pixel]]s in height). However, at the same time, the designs had to be detailed enough so as to seem at least somewhat realistic, even at such a small size. To solve this problem, Wallner decided to exaggerate their proportions, \"so that the subtleties could be recognised.\" He also decided to give them weapons and tools proportionally too big, as correctly sized implements would be far too small to be seen. After a week, Wallner presented his first 3D designs to Wertich and Hess (the standard Roman carriers, diggers and builders),<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 2): Als die Siedler laufen lernten | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last1=Wertich | first1=Volker | last2=Hess | first2=Torsten | last3=Wallner | first3=Thorsten | issue=72 | date=September 1998 | pages=26\u201327 | url=https://ia600307.us.archive.org/16/items/PC.Games.N072.1998.09-fl0n/PC.Games.N072.1998.09-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 17, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref> who decided to make some additional changes, such as making the settlers more rotund and enlarging the heads.<ref name=\"Teil 2 (27)\">{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 2): Als die Siedler laufen lernten | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last1=Wertich | first1=Volker | last2=Hess | first2=Torsten | last3=Wallner | first3=Thorsten | issue=72 | date=September 1998 | page=27 | url=https://ia600307.us.archive.org/16/items/PC.Games.N072.1998.09-fl0n/PC.Games.N072.1998.09-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 17, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nWallner then turned his attentions to the animations. As all the animations in the game had to be interchangeable for every settler (walking, bending etc.), he first needed to work on the [[skeletal animation]]. Unsatisfied with the results when he attempted to use 3D Studio Max, he chose instead to build an \"extremely primitive skeletal settler which we could put under the visible structure of our figures.\" The drawback to this approach was that all actions had to animated separately, frame-by-frame.<ref name=\"Teil 2 (27)\"/>\n\n===Plot and cutscenes===\nIn January 1998, Hess met with Blue Byte's head writer, Wolfgang Walk, to discuss the game's storyline. As it had already been decided that a new gameplay element  would be \"Divine Intervention\", Hess suggested the plot have something to do with the gods of each culture, and the two worked out a rough draft in a single evening, based around a competition between [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (Roman), [[Horus]] (Egyptian) and [[Chiyou|Chi-yu]] (Asian). Hertzler and Wertich approved the concept, but it quickly became apparent that the team currently working on the game would have no time to design or render any [[cutscene]]s. As a result, Hess suggested using a [[traditional animation]] studio with whom he had worked in the past, a Turkish company called Denge Animation.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 4): Teure Tricks | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last=Hess | first=Torsten | issue=74 | date=November 1998 | page=86 | url=https://ia600305.us.archive.org/22/items/PC.Games.N074.1998.11-fl0n/PC.Games.N074.1998.11-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 18, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref> Subsequently, based on designs created by Hess, one of Blue Byte's in-house artists, Tom Thiel, drew sketches of the three main characters, with different facial expressions and seen from different angles, from which Denge would ultimately produce the finished animation.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 4): Teure Tricks | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last=Hess | first=Torsten | issue=74 | date=November 1998 | pages=86\u201387 | url=https://ia600305.us.archive.org/22/items/PC.Games.N074.1998.11-fl0n/PC.Games.N074.1998.11-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 18, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n===Announcement and promotion===\nThe game was officially announced in February 1998, with a release slated for the fourth quarter of the same year.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=News: WiSims & Strategie & Denkspiele | magazine=[[PC Games]] | issue=65 | date=February 1998 | page=14 | url=https://ia600503.us.archive.org/25/items/PC.Games.N065.1998.02-fl0n/PC.Games.N065.1998.02-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 15, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blue-bytes-plans/1100-2462233/ | title=Blue Byte's plans | website=[[GameSpot]] | last=Jebens | first=Harley | date=February 2, 1998 | access-date=July 24, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707014712/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blue-bytes-plans/1100-2462233/ | archive-date=July 7, 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref>  In March, German magazine ''[[GameStar]]'' broke the story that ''Settlers III'' would be the first game in the series to feature online multiplayer.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Spiele-News | magazine=[[GameStar]] | date=March 1998 | page=9 | url=https://bk.gamestar.de/getcatalog.do?title=GameStar&preview=true&catalogId=8445&year=1998&number=3#page_1 | access-date=February 15, 2017 | language=German}} {{subscription required}}</ref> In a May press release, Torsten Hess explained that although the game would still be played from an isometric perspective, it would feature completely new graphics, with a mixture of both 2D and 3D elements.

Using Blue Byte's own in-house copy protection system, Sysiphus, pirated copies of the game would seem to run perfectly at first.

Together with the large circulation of computer viruses, it has become apparent that there was a great need for information. We have expanded our ability to offer assistance. Our hotline has been extended and new technical equipment has been installed. We hope to offer the usual high level of service which Blue Byte has always maintained. We regret that the need for copy protection may lead to complications for our customers.

Released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in November 1998, it is the third game in [[The Settlers|''The Settlers'' series]], following ''[[The Settlers (video game)|The Settlers]]'' (1993) and ''[[The Settlers II]]'' (1996). In April 1999, Blue Byte released an [[Expansion pack|expansion]], ''The Settlers III Mission CD'', featuring new [[Single-player video game|single-player]] campaign missions, new maps for both single-player and [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] modes, and a [[Level (video games)#Level editor|map editor]]. In October, they released a second expansion, ''The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons'' ({{lang-de|Die Siedler III: Das Geheimnis der Amazonen}}), containing two new single-player campaigns, additional single-player and multiplayer maps, and an enhanced editor. In June 2000, ''The Settlers III: Gold Edition'' was released, containing the original game and both expansions, plus fan-made maps for single-player and multiplayer modes, a new Easy difficulty setting for single-player games, [[HTML]] hints and tips, and minor [[Video game graphics|graphical]] enhancements and [[gameplay]] tweaks. In 2013, the ''Gold Edition'' was released on [[GOG.com]] under its North American title, ''The Settlers III: Ultimate Collection'', and in 2018, it was re-released as ''The Settlers III: History Edition''.\n\nIn the game's single-player campaign, the player controls one of three races ([[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] or [[Xia dynasty|Asians]]) whose respective deities are summoned by the great god HE, after HE becomes dissatisfied with how the lesser gods are ruling. HE tells them they must each pick a champion from among their people, and have him lead a war against the other peoples, with the gods of the two losing races facing an arduous and absurd punishment. ''Quest of the Amazons'' tells a prequel story, chronicling how [[Helios]]'s daughter, Q'nq\u00fcra, becomes HIS personal assistant, engineering events so that women become the secret rulers of the universe. ''Quest'' allows the player to choose from one of two campaigns; either controlling the [[Amazons]] against the other three races, or controlling the combined forces of the others against the Amazons.\n\nThe game was [[Video game design#Game designer|designed]] and co-[[Video game programmer|programmed]] by Volker Wertich, creator of the original ''Settlers'' game. Having consulted fan feedback from the first two games, Wertich wanted to expand the scope of the third installment as much as possible, whilst preserving the elements which made the series unique. Although the core [[supply and demand]]-based gameplay is broadly the same as in previous titles, many of the [[game mechanics]] have been altered. For example, combat is more involved, with the player given direct control over their army; roads are no longer necessary to connect buildings, as all settlers can now walk freely around the player's territory; headquarters no longer automatically generate settlers as required, instead the player must build residences to gain new settlers; and the different races are no longer merely aesthetically differentiated, they now have different [[economic model]]s, different magic spells, different war machines, and several unique abilities and buildings. The game was also the first in the series to feature online multiplayer, the addition of which had been one of the main requests from fans.\n\n''The Settlers III'' received mixed reviews. Although acclaimed in its native Germany, where it was heralded as the best game in the series thus far, the international reaction was more muted. Whilst the  economic system and the interrelatedness of the various buildings were generally praised, and the graphics and [[Computer animation|animations]] especially lauded, most critics felt it was too similar to previous ''Settlers'' titles, with the changes to the mechanics seen as not enough to fully differentiate it from its predecessors. The game was a commercial success, selling over 200,000 units in Germany within the first twelve months of its release, and ultimately going on to sell over 700,000 units worldwide.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''The Settlers III'' is a [[real-time strategy]] game with [[City-building game|city-building]] elements,<ref name=\"GSpot\"/><ref name=\"Replay\"/><ref name=\"Ars\"/> controlled via a [[point and click]] interface, in which the primary goal on most [[Level (video gaming)|maps]] is to build a settlement with a functioning [[economy]], producing sufficient military units so as to conquer rival territories, ultimately gaining control of either the entire map, or a certain predetermined section of it.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Settlers III Instruction Manual ''(NA)'' | last1=Collins | first1=Dale | last2=Walk | first2=Wolfgang | last3=Harding | first3=Chris | url=http://files.replacementdocs.com/The_Settlers_III_-_Manual_-_PC.pdf | publisher=[[Blue Byte]] | year=1998 | chapter=Getting Started | page=12 | access-date=April 5, 2018 | format=PDF | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405010153/http://files.replacementdocs.com/The_Settlers_III_-_Manual_-_PC.pdf | archive-date=April 5, 2018 | url-status=live}}</ref> To achieve this end, the player must engage in [[Micromanagement (gameplay)|economic micromanagement]], construct buildings, and generate [[resource]]s.<ref name=\"Preview\">{{cite web | url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/settlers-iii-preview/1100-2563217/ | title=''Settlers III'' Preview | website=[[GameSpot]] | last=Dulin | first=Ron | date=November 6, 1998 | access-date=July 24, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707013958/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/settlers-iii-preview/1100-2563217/ | archive-date=July 7, 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Game modes===\nThe game can be played in one of three modes; \"[[Single-player video game|Single Player]]: Scenario\", \"[[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer]]\", or \"Campaign\".<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web | url=https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/02/05/settlers-3 | title=''Settlers 3'' Review | website=[[IGN]] | last=Blevins | first=Tal | date=February 4, 1999 | access-date=June 15, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331105942/https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/02/05/settlers-3 | archive-date=March 31, 2016 | url-status=live}}</ref> In Campaign mode, the player must complete a series of missions, the goal of most of which is to defeat the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|computer controlled]] opponent or opponents by gaining possession of their territory.<ref name=\"Campaign\">{{cite book | title=The Settlers III HTML Manual | last1=Collins | first1=Dale | last2=Liebich | first2=Sven | last3=Walk | first3=Wolfgang | last4=Harding | first4=Chris | publisher=[[Blue Byte]] | year=2000 | chapter=Campaign}}</ref> In the original release of the game, there were three separate campaigns of eight missions each; one campaign each for the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], and [[Xia dynasty|Asians]].

The story begins with [[Helios]], Jupiter, Horus and Ch'ih-yu drinking in the 3 [[Gorgon]]s tavern. At the encouragement of his friends, Helios is drowning his sorrows, after his son [[Phaethon]] died whilst attempting to use the sun-chariot to impress women, but was unable to control the horses. After becoming drunk, Helios is seduced by [[Medusa]]. Several years later, she is \"killed in a bar fight with [[Perseus]],\" and Helios learns he had fathered a daughter, Q'nq\u00fcra. Raising her himself, Helios introduces her to HE, whom she impresses with her irreverence, and when she is of age, HE makes her goddess of the [[Amazons|Azzi]]. Choosing [[Penthesilea]] as their leader, she awaits as they build up their strength, ready to strike out at the male tribes.\n\n;Amazon Campaign\n\nThe Amazons begin their offensive by destroying a colony of Egyptians, overrunning a Roman encampment, and desecrating a sacred Asian mountain, prompting Jupiter, Horus and Ch'ih-yu to ally.<ref>{{cite video game | title=The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons | developer=[[Blue Byte]] | publisher=[[Blue Byte]] | date=1999 | level=Amazon 4: The Gang Up | quote='''[[Helios]]''': My old friends had finally formed an alliance, preparing to settle things once and for all with a swift and mighty blow.}}</ref> After their initial attacks are repulsed, they are able to disrupt Penthesilea's iron production, hence her ability to create weaponry, forcing the Amazons to retreat to a more fortified position.<ref>{{cite video game | title=The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons | developer=[[Blue Byte]] | publisher=[[Blue Byte]] | date=1999 | level=Amazon 8: Beating a Retreat | quote='''Helios''': Surrounded by Romans, it was only a question of time before her settlement could no longer be held, but Penthesilea did not shrink from battle.

They barely survive, and the Amazons next attack the Asians and Egyptians in turn, prompting Jupiter, Horus and Ch'ih-yu to ally. In the newly renamed 2 Gorgons, they meet to discuss strategy, fully aware that the Gorgons, Q'nq\u00fcra's aunts, are spying on them, and feeding details of their plan to Q'nq\u00fcra. Meanwhile, the men launch an all-out offensive, although Helios is worried that Q'nq\u00fcra's response is too subdued, and she must have a plan.

Jupiter, however, sullen at never having wreaked havoc with a glorious deluge, declared that he too had done enough, and in any case certainly more than Horus.

Initially, [[Blue Byte]] had no immediate plans to do a third title in the [[The Settlers|series]], but due to the unexpected popularity of both ''[[The Settlers (video game)|The Settlers]]'' and its sequel, Volker Wertich ([[Video game design#Game designer|designer]] and [[Video game programmer|programmer]] of the original) and Thomas Hertzler (Blue Byte [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and the series [[Video game producer|producer]]) decided to begin [[Video game development|development]].<ref name=\"Teil 1 (236)\">{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 1): Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last1=Wertich | first1=Volker | last2=Hess | first2=Torsten | issue=71 | date=August 1998 | page=236 | url=https://ia600305.us.archive.org/19/items/PC.Games.N071.1998.08-fl0n/PC.Games.N071.1998.08-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 15, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref> Wertich had not been involved in the making of the second game, because, as he describes it, \"after two years [[Game programming|programming]] ''The Settlers'', I didn't really want to see those little men for a while.\" However, by 1997, he was ready to resume working on the series, eager to implement ideas which he felt would allow the game to compete with rival titles such as ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness|Warcraft II]]'' and ''[[Anno 1602]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pcgames.de/Die-Siedler-Spiel-21490/Specials/Die-Siedler-Kleine-Maennlein-ganz-gross-Eine-grosse-Serie-im-Rueckblick-Siedler-1-bis-Siedler-4-646822/ | title=''Die Siedler'': Kleine M\u00e4nnlein ganz gro\u00df - Eine gro\u00dfe Serie im R\u00fcckblick (''Siedler 1'' bis ''Siedler 4'') | website=[[PC Games]] | last=Wilke | first=Thomas | date=June 10, 2008 | access-date=February 24, 2017 | language=German}}</ref>\n\nWertich's core [[Video game design|design]] principal was to preserve the most popular elements of the ''Settlers'' [[gameplay]], but improve the [[Video game graphics|graphics]], and both expand and improve upon the [[game mechanics]] as much as possible. He began by going through feedback from fans of the first two games, and quickly saw two recurring suggestions; to improve the unreliable shipping system from ''Settlers II'', and to implement [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]] capabilities, something he began programming immediately.<ref name=\"Teil 1 (236)\"/>\n\nThe first major design decision Wertich made related to the complexity of the game's [[economic system]]. Due to the innovations he planned to introduce to the mechanics, and because the [[supply and demand]]-based gameplay of ''Settlers III'' was going to be more intricate than in previous titles, he felt that forcing players to concentrate too much on logistics would serve as an unwelcome distraction, and so decided to remove the need for a [[Street network|road network]]. Instead, settlers would have the freedom to move anywhere within the player's settlement, with the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] handling [[pathfinding]].<ref name=\"Teil 1 (237)\">{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 1): Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last1=Wertich | first1=Volker | last2=Hess | first2=Torsten | issue=71 | date= August 1998 | page=237 | url=https://ia600305.us.archive.org/19/items/PC.Games.N071.1998.08-fl0n/PC.Games.N071.1998.08-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 15, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref> Another early decision was that the different races in ''Settlers III'' wouldn't just look different, they would have different abilities, different [[economic model]]s and certain buildings unique to each one.<ref name=\"Teil 1 (237)\"/> Wertich, in consultation with Hertzler, also decided to create the game in [[high color]], a first for the series, which had used [[8-bit color]] for previous titles.<ref name=\"Teil 1 (237)\"/>\n\n===Programming and animation===\nWith the basic design concepts in place, Wertich, who had programmed the original game alone, decided that although ''Settlers III'' was a much bigger job, he didn't want to have a large programming team. Instead, he elected to have a two-man team work on the game. As his fellow programmer, he hired Dirk Ringe, who got the job after responding to an advert on a noticeboard in the [[Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz]] looking for \"a [[C++]] programmer for a new [[strategy game]].\"<ref name=\"Teil 1 (237)\"/> Torsten Hess was then hired as the main [[Video game graphics|graphics]] designer/[[Video game artist|artist]]. After making some pencil sketches outlining his basic ideas, Hess began to [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the graphics in [[Autodesk 3ds Max|3D Studio Max]], as Wertich had decided to integrate the [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] graphics of the first two games with certain [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphical elements.<ref name=\"Teil 1 (238)\">{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 1): Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last1=Wertich | first1=Volker | last2=Hess | first2=Torsten | issue=71 | date=August 1998 | page=238 | url=https://ia600305.us.archive.org/19/items/PC.Games.N071.1998.08-fl0n/PC.Games.N071.1998.08-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 15, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nWertich, Ringe and Hess then faced their biggest decision yet; deciding which races to include. After several \"sprawling meetings\", they settled on [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Xia dynasty|Asians]], and Hess began the task of aesthetically differentiating the races.<ref name=\"Teil 1 (238)\"/> In March, a discussion arose about the possibility of including female settlers. However, they decided against it because, as Hess explains, \"we would have had to duplicate all the graphics (male and female), so that every settler could accept all professions.\" As they were unwilling to limit female settlers to certain professions, it was decided to have exclusively male populations, but the concept for having an all-female race remained a possibility for a potential [[Expansion pack|expansion]] in the future.<ref name=\"Teil 1 (238)\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Hess began work on the buildings for each race, creating [[Texture mapping|textures]] in [[Adobe Photoshop]], which he then \"dirtied\", so as to create a lived-in, real-world sense; for example, he ensured the diagonal lines of the [[Egyptian pyramids]] were crooked, as he felt to have them perfectly straight and geometrical would be unrealistic.<ref name=\"Teil 1 (238)\"/> The textures were then \"hand painted\",<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 3): Hausmeister | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last1=Mutschall | first1=Thorsten | last2=Wertich | first2=Volker | last3=Ringe | first3=Dirk | last4=Hess | first4=Torsten | issue=72 | date=September 1998 | page=20 | url=https://ia600307.us.archive.org/16/items/PC.Games.N073.1998.10-fl0n/PC.Games.N073.1998.10-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 18, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref> and [[Gouraud shading]] was later added to complete the look.<ref name=\"PC Games 110\"/>\n\nBy July, Hess had begun working on the sketches for the individual settlers, paying particular attention to the differentiations between the same settler from different races (the specific differences between a Roman and an Egyptian baker, for example). However, it soon became apparent that the workload was too much for one person, and in August a second artist was hired; Thorsten Wallner, who also worked as the game's [[3D modeling]] artist and [[Character animation|character animator]].<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 2): Als die Siedler laufen lernten | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last1=Wertich | first1=Volker | last2=Hess | first2=Torsten | last3=Wallner | first3=Thorsten | issue=72 | date=September 1998 | page=26 | url=https://ia600307.us.archive.org/16/items/PC.Games.N072.1998.09-fl0n/PC.Games.N072.1998.09-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 17, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref> Once on board, Wallner realised that Hess's designs were too detailed, and, as a result, were unrealisable given the current level of technology, so the pair decided to scrap them, and redesign the characters from scratch. Hess had failed to take into account that the designs of the settlers couldn't be too complex, since small details would be lost, given their size (32 [[pixel]]s in height). However, at the same time, the designs had to be detailed enough so as to seem at least somewhat realistic, even at such a small size. To solve this problem, Wallner decided to exaggerate their proportions, \"so that the subtleties could be recognised.\" He also decided to give them weapons and tools proportionally too big, as correctly sized implements would be far too small to be seen. After a week, Wallner presented his first 3D designs to Wertich and Hess (the standard Roman carriers, diggers and builders),<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 2): Als die Siedler laufen lernten | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last1=Wertich | first1=Volker | last2=Hess | first2=Torsten | last3=Wallner | first3=Thorsten | issue=72 | date=September 1998 | pages=26\u201327 | url=https://ia600307.us.archive.org/16/items/PC.Games.N072.1998.09-fl0n/PC.Games.N072.1998.09-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 17, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref> who decided to make some additional changes, such as making the settlers more rotund and enlarging the heads.<ref name=\"Teil 2 (27)\">{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 2): Als die Siedler laufen lernten | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last1=Wertich | first1=Volker | last2=Hess | first2=Torsten | last3=Wallner | first3=Thorsten | issue=72 | date=September 1998 | page=27 | url=https://ia600307.us.archive.org/16/items/PC.Games.N072.1998.09-fl0n/PC.Games.N072.1998.09-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 17, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nWallner then turned his attentions to the animations. As all the animations in the game had to be interchangeable for every settler (walking, bending etc.), he first needed to work on the [[skeletal animation]]. Unsatisfied with the results when he attempted to use 3D Studio Max, he chose instead to build an \"extremely primitive skeletal settler which we could put under the visible structure of our figures.\" The drawback to this approach was that all actions had to animated separately, frame-by-frame.<ref name=\"Teil 2 (27)\"/>\n\n===Plot and cutscenes===\nIn January 1998, Hess met with Blue Byte's head writer, Wolfgang Walk, to discuss the game's storyline. As it had already been decided that a new gameplay element  would be \"Divine Intervention\", Hess suggested the plot have something to do with the gods of each culture, and the two worked out a rough draft in a single evening, based around a competition between [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (Roman), [[Horus]] (Egyptian) and [[Chiyou|Chi-yu]] (Asian). Hertzler and Wertich approved the concept, but it quickly became apparent that the team currently working on the game would have no time to design or render any [[cutscene]]s. As a result, Hess suggested using a [[traditional animation]] studio with whom he had worked in the past, a Turkish company called Denge Animation.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 4): Teure Tricks | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last=Hess | first=Torsten | issue=74 | date=November 1998 | page=86 | url=https://ia600305.us.archive.org/22/items/PC.Games.N074.1998.11-fl0n/PC.Games.N074.1998.11-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 18, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref> Subsequently, based on designs created by Hess, one of Blue Byte's in-house artists, Tom Thiel, drew sketches of the three main characters, with different facial expressions and seen from different angles, from which Denge would ultimately produce the finished animation.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Das Tagebuch der ''Siedler 3''-Macher (Teil 4): Teure Tricks | magazine=[[PC Games]] | last=Hess | first=Torsten | issue=74 | date=November 1998 | pages=86\u201387 | url=https://ia600305.us.archive.org/22/items/PC.Games.N074.1998.11-fl0n/PC.Games.N074.1998.11-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 18, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n===Announcement and promotion===\nThe game was officially announced in February 1998, with a release slated for the fourth quarter of the same year.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=News: WiSims & Strategie & Denkspiele | magazine=[[PC Games]] | issue=65 | date=February 1998 | page=14 | url=https://ia600503.us.archive.org/25/items/PC.Games.N065.1998.02-fl0n/PC.Games.N065.1998.02-fl0n.pdf | access-date=February 15, 2017 | language=German | format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blue-bytes-plans/1100-2462233/ | title=Blue Byte's plans | website=[[GameSpot]] | last=Jebens | first=Harley | date=February 2, 1998 | access-date=July 24, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707014712/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blue-bytes-plans/1100-2462233/ | archive-date=July 7, 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref>  In March, German magazine ''[[GameStar]]'' broke the story that ''Settlers III'' would be the first game in the series to feature online multiplayer.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Spiele-News | magazine=[[GameStar]] | date=March 1998 | page=9 | url=https://bk.gamestar.de/getcatalog.do?title=GameStar&preview=true&catalogId=8445&year=1998&number=3#page_1 | access-date=February 15, 2017 | language=German}} {{subscription required}}</ref> In a May press release, Torsten Hess explained that although the game would still be played from an isometric perspective, it would feature completely new graphics, with a mixture of both 2D and 3D elements.

The quantity of pirated versions has been significantly reduced.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.csoon.com/issue34/p_blueb.htm | title=Blue Byte Software Sell-In 500,000 Units Of ''The Settlers III'' Worldwide | website=Coming Soon Magazine | date=January 11, 1999 | access-date=November 29, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107034310/http://www.csoon.com/issue34/p_blueb.htm | archive-date=January 7, 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, with the success of the game, and due to several other factors (for example, many pirated copies came with full artwork and instructions, and so appeared to be genuine copies, whilst even players with real copies of the game could encounter copy protection issues if they had certain [[Computer virus|viruses]] on their computers, or if they had older [[CD-ROM]]s), rumours began to circulate that the game was suffering from potentially game-breaking bugs, leading Blue Byte to issue a statement;\n\n{{quote|with such widespread distribution, the frequency of pirated software is increasing. Together with the large circulation of computer viruses, it has become apparent that there was a great need for information. We have expanded our ability to offer assistance. Our hotline has been extended and new technical equipment has been installed. We hope to offer the usual high level of service which Blue Byte has always maintained. We regret that the need for copy protection may lead to complications for our customers. The integration of high-quality copy protection costs energy, time and money; effort we would rather invest in the development of our products.

He especially praised the complexity of the economic system, which he lauded as \"a perfectly designed, hugely detailed, interlinking chain which is utterly absorbing to construct.\" He was also impressed with the graphics, calling it \"the best looking 2D strategy game ever.\" His only real criticism concerned combat, which he found difficult to control.<ref name=\"PCGUK\"/>\n\n''[[PC Games]]''{{'}} Petra Mauer\u00f6der scored it 88%, giving it a \"''PC Games'' Award\" and naming it Game of the Month. She praised online multiplayer, the differentiation between the races, the implementation of manna, and combat, writing \"the depth of the game is immense, and both the graphics and the multiplayer features set new standards.\" Her criticisms focused on the single-player campaign (which she called \"streamlined [and] monotonous\"), poor pathfinding for trade ships, weak AI, and occasionally misleading mission briefings. She felt that, cumulatively, these problems suggested the game may have been rushed through the final stages of development in time for the Christmas market. However, she concluded, \"''The Settlers III'' [is] beautifully presented, quickly learned, and fun for weeks.\"<ref name=\"PC Games\"/>\n\n''[[PC Player (German magazine)|PC Player]]''{{'}}s Thomas Werner scored it 85 out of 100, giving it a \"Gold Player\" award.

However, he praised the graphics, character animations, [[level design]] and the tactical aspects of combat, concluding \"''The Settlers 3'' is the best game in the ''Settlers'' series, and the new benchmark in the [[City-building game|city-building genre]].\"<ref name=\"PC Player\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[PC Gamer#PC Gamer US|PC Gamer (US)]]'', Joe Novicki scored it 85%, praising the removal of roads, the enhanced combat, and the addition of online multiplayer.

He praised the intricacies of the economic system, writing the \"level of complexity sets ''Settlers III'' apart from other real-time strategy games.\" He also praised the graphics and animations, but was critical of online multiplayer mode, which he called \"a disaster.\" He concluded by referring to the game as \"interesting [and] fairly innovative.\"<ref name=\"Rev\"/>\n\n''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s Tal Blevins scored it 6.9 out of 10, writing \"''Settlers III'' is a good game, but there's nothing really new or innovative here.\" Although he praised the differentiation between the races, the introduction of divine intervention, and the supply and demand-based gameplay, he cited \"a slew of glaring problems which mar an otherwise brilliant game.\" Such problems include the inability to load a game without having to return to the main menu, the necessity for \"quirky\" disk swapping, the limited control of combat units, poor AI, and the inability to access the [[HTML]] manual from within an active game. He concluded \"''Settlers III'' is an entertaining and brain-heavy game that is unfortunately hampered by a number of problems.\"<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s Ron Dulin scored it 6.1 out of 10, arguing that it plays almost identically to ''The Settlers II'', and citing \"surface changes [which] make only a moderate improvement.\" He was especially critical of the similarity of the missions, writing \"each mission is almost exactly the same. You start off with some supplies and must expand until you encounter an enemy.\" Although he praised the decision to remove roads, and the addition of online multiplayer, overall he felt the game didn't improve on its predecessors, concluding, \"those who love the ''Settlers'' formula will enjoy it, but those who are unfamiliar with it will likely find it to be a moderately fun multiplayer game and an immensely repetitive single-player game.\"<ref name=\"GSpot\"/>\n\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s Samuel Baker II scored it 2.5 out of 5. Although he praised the economic system, and the complex interrelations between the various buildings, he was critical of the lack of an in-depth tutorial, the necessity to return to the main menu so as to load a new game, and overly simplistic combat. He also cited numerous [[Software bug|bugs]] with the copy-protection system. He concluded, \"there is something compelling about ''Settlers III''. Many times I played longer than intended, wanting to tweak just one more thing. But in the end, the feeling of playing a loser remains.\"<ref name=\"CGW\"/>\n\n''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' rated the game two stars out of five, stating, \"it's mildly entertaining to construct buildings, gather resources, and trade goods, but in the end, ''The Settlers III'' is a disappointment, lacking the creativity needed to compete in today's overcrowded RTS market.\"<ref name=\"NG\"/>\n\n===Sales and awards===\n''The Settlers III'' was a commercial success.

This phenomenon, denoted [[New Imperialism]], saw the conquest of nearly all Southeast Asian territories by the colonial powers. The Dutch East India Company and British East India Company were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. \n[[File:AMH-5626-NA Bird's eye view of the city of Judja.jpg|thumb|left|The map of Thai city [[Ayutthaya]] made by [[Johannes Vingboons]] a Dutch cartographer in 1665.

In the [[History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)|Philippines]], the 1872 [[Cavite Mutiny]] was a precursor to the [[Philippine Revolution]] (1896\u20131898). When the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] began in Cuba in 1898, Filipino revolutionaries [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|declared Philippine independence]] and established the [[First Philippine Republic]] the following year. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]] that ended the war with Spain, the United States gained the Philippines and other territories; in refusing to recognise the nascent republic, America effectively reversed her position of 1856. This led directly to the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], in which the First Republic was defeated; wars followed with the [[Republic of Zamboanga]], the [[Republic of Negros]] and the [[Tagalog Republic#Sakay|Republic of Katagalugan]], all of which were also defeated.\n\nColonial rule had had a profound effect on Southeast Asia. While the colonial powers profited much from the region's vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent. Commercial agriculture, mining and an export based economy developed rapidly during this period. The introduction Christianity bought by the colonist also have profound effect in the societal change.\n\nIncreased labour demand resulted in mass immigration, especially from [[British India]] and [[China]], which brought about massive demographic change. The institutions for a modern [[nation state]] like a state bureaucracy, courts of law, print media and to a smaller extent, modern education, sowed the seeds of the fledgling [[nationalism|nationalist]]  movements in the colonial territories. In the inter-war years, these nationalist movements grew and often clashed with the colonial authorities when they demanded [[self-determination]].\n\n== 20th-century Southeast Asia ==\n\n=== Japanese invasion and occupations ===\n{{Further |Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Pacific War}}\n[[File:Japanese light tanks moving toward Manila.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese imperial army entering [[Manila]], January 1942.]]\nIn September 1940, following the [[Fall of France]] and pursuant to the Pacific war goals of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]], the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]  invaded [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|Vichy French Indochina]], which ended in the abortive [[Japanese coup de main in French Indochina]] of 9 March 1945.

After suppressing the communist insurrection during the [[Malayan Emergency]] from 1948 to 1960, Britain granted independence to [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] and later, [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in 1957 and 1963 respectively within the framework of the [[Malaysia|Federation of Malaysia]]. In one of the most bloody single incidents of violence in Cold War Southeast Asia, General Suharto [[Overthrow of Sukarno|seized power in Indonesia]] in 1965 and initiated [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u20131966|a massacre]] of approximately 500,000 alleged members of the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI).\n\nFollowing the independence of the [[Indochina]] states with the [[battle of Dien Bien Phu]], [[North Vietnam]]ese attempts to conquer [[South Vietnam]] resulted in the [[Vietnam War]]. The conflict spread to [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] and heavy intervention from the [[United States]]. By the war's end in 1975, all these countries were controlled by communist parties. After the communist victory, two wars between communist states\u2014the [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War]] of 1975\u201389 and the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] of 1979\u2014were fought in the region.

However, independence was short-lived as Indonesia [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|annexed the territory]] soon after. However, after more than [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|20 years of fighting Indonesia]], East Timor won its independence and was recognised by the UN in 2002. Finally, Britain ended its protectorate of the Sultanate of [[Brunei]] in 1984, marking the end of European rule in Southeast Asia.\n\n==Contemporary Southeast Asia==\n[[File:ASEAN Nations Flags in Jakarta 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[ASEAN]] members' flags in [[Jakarta]].]]\nModern Southeast Asia has been characterised by high economic growth by most countries and closer regional integration.

As of late, [[Vietnam]] too had been experiencing an economic boom. However, [[Myanmar]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]] and the newly independent [[East Timor]] are still lagging economically.\n\nOn 8 August 1967, the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) was founded by Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Since Cambodian admission into the union in 1999, East Timor is the only Southeast Asian country that is not part of ASEAN, although plans are under way for eventual membership. The association aims to enhance co-operation among Southeast Asian community. [[ASEAN Free Trade Area]] has been established to encourage greater trade among ASEAN members.

Initially they were used in [[telegraphy]], which developed in the late 1830s and 1840s as the first use of [[electrical engineering]]<ref>{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= Steven |author-link= Stephen Roberts (historian) |title= Distant Writing|url= http://distantwriting.co.uk/index.htm }}</ref>, though teleprinters weren't used for telegraphy until 1887 at the earliest.<ref>{{Citation |last=Nelson |first= R.A. |title= History Of Teletype Development |url= https://www.thocp.net/hardware/history_of_teletype_development_.htm}}</ref> The machines were adapted to provide a [[user interface]] to early [[mainframe computer]]s and [[minicomputer]]s, sending typed data to the computer and printing the response. Some models could also be used to create [[punched tape]] for [[Computer data storage|data storage]] (either from typed input or from data received from a remote source) and to read back such tape for local printing or transmission.\n\nTeleprinters could use a variety of different communication media. These included a simple pair of wires; dedicated non-switched telephone circuits (leased lines); [[switched communication network|switched networks]] that operated similarly to the [[public telephone network]] ([[telex]]); and radio and [[microwave]] links (telex-on-radio, or TOR). A teleprinter attached to a [[modem]] could also communicate through standard switched public telephone lines. This latter configuration was often used to connect teleprinters to remote computers, particularly in [[time-sharing]] environments.\n\nTeleprinters have largely been replaced by fully electronic [[computer terminal]]s which typically have a [[computer monitor]] instead of a printer (though the term \"TTY\" is still occasionally used to refer to them, such as in [[Unix]] systems). Teleprinters are still widely used in the aviation industry (see [[Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network|AFTN]] and [[airline teletype system]]), and variations called [[Telecommunications device for the deaf|Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf]] (TDDs) are used by the [[hearing loss|hearing impaired]] for typed communications over ordinary telephone lines.\n\n==History==\nThe teleprinter evolved through a series of inventions by a number of engineers, including [[Samuel Morse]], [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], [[Royal Earl House]], [[David Edward Hughes]], [[Emile Baudot]], [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]], [[Charles L. Krum]], [[Edward Kleinschmidt]] and [[Frederick G. Creed]]. Teleprinters were invented in order to send and receive messages without the need for operators trained in the use of Morse code. A system of two teleprinters, with one operator trained to use a keyboard, replaced two trained Morse code operators. The teleprinter system improved message speed and delivery time, making it possible for messages to be flashed across a country with little manual intervention.<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\">{{Citation| title = Typewriter May Soon Be Transmitter of Telegrams | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = January 25, 1914| url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/01/25/100081424.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThere were a number of parallel developments on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In 1835 [[Samuel Morse]] devised a recording telegraph, and [[Morse code]] was born.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co32957/type-used-for-original-morse-telegraph-1835-movable-type|title=Type used for original morse telegraph, 1835|website=[[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]|access-date=2017-12-05|quote=Samuel Morse was one of the pioneers of electric telegraphy. Prompted by receiving news of his wife's death too late to attend her funeral, Morse was determined to improve the speed of long distance communications (which at that point relied on horse messengers).}}</ref> Morse's instrument used a current to displace the armature of an electromagnet, which moved a marker, therefore recording the breaks in the current. Cooke & Wheatstone received a British patent covering telegraphy in 1837 and a second one in 1840 which described a type-printing telegraph with steel type fixed at the tips of petals of a rotating brass daisy-wheel, struck by an \u201celectric hammer\u201d to print Roman letters through carbon paper onto a moving paper tape. In 1841 [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] devised an electromagnetic printing telegraph machine. It used pulses of electricity created by rotating a dial over contact points to release and stop a type-wheel turned by weight-driven clockwork; a second clockwork mechanism rotated a drum covered with a sheet of paper and moved it slowly upwards so that the type-wheel printed its signals in a spiral. The critical issue was to have the sending and receiving elements working synchronously. Bain attempted to achieve this using [[centrifugal governor]]s to closely regulate the speed of the clockwork. It was patented, along with other devices, on April 21, 1841.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://distantwriting.co.uk/bain.html|title=Distant Writing - Bain|author=Steven Roberts}}</ref>\n\nBy 1846, the [[Samuel Morse|Morse]] telegraph service was operational between Washington, D.C., and New York. [[Royal Earl House]] patented his [[printing telegraph]] that same year. He linked two 28-key piano-style keyboards by wire. Each piano key represented a letter of the alphabet and when pressed caused the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. A \"shift\" key gave each main key two optional values. A 56-character typewheel at the sending end was synchronised to coincide with a similar wheel at the receiving end. If the key corresponding to a particular character was pressed at the home station, it actuated the typewheel at the distant station just as the same character moved into the printing position, in a way similar to the [[daisy wheel printer]]. It was thus an example of a synchronous data transmission system. House's equipment could transmit around 40 instantly readable words per minute, but was difficult to manufacture in bulk. The printer could copy and print out up to 2,000 words per hour. This invention was first put in operation and exhibited at the [[Mechanics Institute]] in New York in 1844.\n\nLandline teleprinter operations began in 1849, when a circuit was put in service between Philadelphia and New York City.<ref>''RTTY Journal'' Vol. 25 No. 9, October 1977: 2.</ref>\n\n[[File:Printing Telegraph.jpg|thumb|[[David Edward Hughes|Hughes]] telegraph, an early (1855) teleprinter built by Siemens and Halske. The [[centrifugal governor]] to achieve synchronicity with the other end can be seen clearly.]]\nIn 1855, [[David Edward Hughes]] introduced an improved machine built on the work of Royal Earl House. In less than two years, a number of small telegraph companies, including [[Western Union]] in early stages of development, united to form one large corporation \u2013 Western Union Telegraph Co. \u2013 to carry on the business of telegraphy on the Hughes system.<ref name=\"Clarkson\">{{cite web | url = http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html | title = David Edward Hughes | accessdate =September 29, 2010 | date = April 14, 2007 | publisher = Clarkson University | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html | archivedate = April 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn France, [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] designed in 1874 a system using a five-unit code, which began to be used extensively in that country from 1877. The British Post Office adopted the Baudot system for use on a simplex circuit between London and Paris in 1897, and subsequently made considerable use of duplex Baudot systems on their Inland Telegraph Services.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hobbs  |first=Alan G. |title=Five-unit codes|url=http://www.nadcomm.com/fiveunit/fiveunits.htm| accessdate =May 1, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDuring 1901, Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]] (1865\u20131945, originally from New Zealand), prompted by his development of a typewriter-like keyboard. The Murray system employed an intermediate step, a keyboard perforator, which allowed an operator to punch a [[paper tape]], and a tape transmitter for sending the message from the punched tape. At the receiving end of the line, a printing mechanism would print on a paper tape, and/or a reperforator could be used to make a perforated copy of the message.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Foster |first=Maximilian |date=August 1901 |title=A Successful Printing Telegraph |magazine=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=II |pages=1195\u20131199 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IF6tNZnhO7wC&pg=PA1195|accessdate=July 9, 2009 |quote= }}</ref> As there was no longer a direct correlation between the operator's hand movement and the bits transmitted, there was no concern about arranging the code to minimize operator fatigue, and instead Murray designed the code to minimize wear on the machinery, assigning the code combinations with the fewest punched holes to the most [[letter frequencies|frequently used characters]]. The Murray code also introduced what became known as \"format effectors\" or \"[[control character]]s\" \u2013 the [[Carriage return|CR]] (Carriage Return) and [[Newline|LF]] (Line Feed) codes. A few of Baudot's codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent.<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\"/>\n\nIn the United States in 1902, electrical engineer Frank Pearne approached [[Joy Morton]], head of [[Morton Salt]], seeking a sponsor for research into the practicalities of developing a [[printing telegraph]] system. Joy Morton needed to determine whether this was worthwhile and so consulted mechanical engineer [[Charles L. Krum]], who was vice president of the Western Cold Storage Company. Krum was interested in helping Pearne, so space was set up in a laboratory in the attic of Western Cold Storage. Frank Pearne lost interest in the project after a year and left to get involved in teaching. Krum was prepared to continue Pearne\u2019s work, and in August, 1903 a patent was filed for a 'typebar page printer'.<ref>{{cite web |\nurl=https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00888335 | title=U.S. Patent 888,335 issued in May, 1908| accessdate=July 14, 2019}}</ref> In 1904, Krum filed a patent for a 'type wheel printing telegraph machine'<ref>{{cite web |\nurl=https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00862402 | title=U.S. Patent 862,402| accessdate=July 14, 2019}}</ref> which was issued in August, 1907.

The new company combined the best features of both their machines into a new typewheel printer for which Kleinschmidt, Howard Krum, and Sterling Morton jointly obtained a patent.<ref name=historytelcom/>\n\nIn 1924 Britain's [[Creed & Company]], founded by [[Frederick G. Creed]], entered the teleprinter field with their Model 1P, a page printer, which was soon superseded by the improved Model 2P. In 1925 Creed acquired the patents for Donald Murray's Murray code, a rationalised Baudot code. The Model 3 tape printer, Creed\u2019s first combined start-stop machine, was introduced in 1927 for the Post Office telegram service. This machine printed received messages directly on to gummed paper tape at a rate of 65 words per minute. Creed created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the [[Daily Mail]] for daily transmission of the newspaper's contents. The Creed Model 7 page printing teleprinter was introduced in 1931 and was used for the inland [[Telex]] service. It worked at a speed of 50 baud, about 66 words a minute, using a code based on the Murray code.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nA teleprinter system was installed in the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] Flight Service Station Airway Radio Stations system in 1928, carrying administrative messages, flight information and weather reports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atchistory.org/History/fsshist.htm|title= Flight Service History 1920-1998}}</ref> By 1938, the FAA's teleprinter network, handling weather traffic, extended over 20,000 miles, covering all 48 states except Maine, New Hampshire, and South Dakota.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf|title=FAA HISTORICAL CHRONOLOGY, 1926-1996}}</ref>\n\n==Ways in which teleprinters were used==\nThere were at least five major types of teleprinter networks:\n* Exchange systems such as [[Telex]] and [[Telex#Teletypewriter eXchange|TWX]] created a real-time circuit between two machines, so that anything typed on one machine appeared at the other end immediately. US and UK systems had telephone dials, and prior to 1981 five [[North American Numbering Plan]] (NANPA) [[area codes]] were reserved for teleprinter use. German systems did \"dialing\" via the keyboard. Typed \"chat\" was possible, but because billing was by connect time, it was common to prepare messages in advance on [[Punched tape|paper tape]] and transmit them without pauses for typing.\n* [[Leased line]] and [[radioteletype]] networks arranged in point-to-point and / or multipoint configurations supported [[data processing]] applications for government and industry, such as integrating the accounting, billing, management, production, purchasing, sales, shipping and receiving departments within an organization to speed internal communications.\n* [[Message switching]] systems were an early form of E-mail, using electromechanical equipment. See [[Telegram]], [[Western Union]], [[Plan 55-A]]. Military organizations had similar but separate systems, such as [[Autodin]].\n* Broadcast systems such as weather information distribution and \"news wires\". Examples were operated by [[Associated Press]], [[National Weather Service]], [[Reuters]], and United Press (later [[UPI]]). Information was printed on receive-only teleprinters, without keyboards or dials.\n* \"Loop\" systems, where anything typed on any machine on the loop printed on all the machines. American police departments used such systems to interconnect precincts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Signaling system |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US2364357A/en |accessdate=7 February 2019 |date=29 March 1944}}</ref>\n\n==Teleprinter operation==\n[[Image:Baudotkeyboard.png|right|frame|422px|[[Alphanumeric keyboard|Keyboard]] of a [[Baudot code|Baudot teleprinter]], with 32 keys, including the space bar]]\n[[File:International Telegraph Alphabet 2 brightened.jpg|thumb|International Telegraph Alphabet 2 development of the Baudot-Murray code]]\nMost teleprinters used the 5-[[bit]] [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA2). This limited the character set to 32 codes (2<sup>5</sup> = 32). One had to use a \"FIGS\" (for \"figures\") [[shift key]] to type numbers and special characters. Special versions of teleprinters had FIGS characters for specific applications, such as weather symbols for weather reports. Print quality was poor by modern standards. The ITA2 code was used [[asynchronous start-stop|asynchronously with start and stop bits]]: the asynchronous code design was intimately linked with the start-stop electro-mechanical design of teleprinters. (Early systems had used synchronous codes, but were hard to synchronize mechanically). Other codes, such as [[FIELDATA]] and [[Flexowriter]], were introduced but never became as popular as ITA2.\n\n''Mark'' and ''space'' are terms describing [[logic level]]s in teleprinter circuits. The native mode of communication for a teleprinter is a simple series [[direct current circuit|DC circuit]] that is interrupted, much as a [[rotary dial]] interrupts a telephone signal. The marking condition is when the circuit is closed (current is flowing), the spacing condition is when the circuit is open (no current is flowing). The \"idle\" condition of the circuit is a continuous marking state, with the start of a character signalled by a \"start bit\", which is always a space. Following the start bit, the character is represented by a fixed number of bits, such as 5 bits in the ITA2 code, each either a mark or a space to denote the specific character or machine function. After the character's bits, the sending machine sends one or more stop bits. The stop bits are marking, so as to be distinct from the subsequent start bit. If the sender has nothing more to send, the line simply remains in the marking state (as if a continuing series of stop bits) until a later space denotes the start of the next character. The time between characters need not be an integral multiple of a bit time, but it must be at least the minimum number of stop bits required by the receiving machine.\n\nWhen the line is broken, the continuous spacing (open circuit, no current flowing) causes a receiving teleprinter to cycle continuously, even in the absence of stop bits. It prints nothing because the characters received are all zeros, the ITA2 blank (or [[ASCII]]) [[null character]].\n\nTeleprinter circuits were generally leased from a communications [[common carrier]] and consisted of ordinary [[telephone cable]]s that extended from the teleprinter located at the customer location to the common carrier [[telephone exchange|central office]]. These teleprinter circuits were connected to switching equipment at the central office for [[Telex]] and [[Telegraphy#TWX|TWX]] service. [[Private line]] teleprinter circuits were not directly connected to switching equipment. Instead, these private line circuits were connected to [[network hub]]s and [[repeater]]s configured to provide point to point or point to multipoint service. More than two teleprinters could be connected to the same wire circuit by means of a [[current loop]].\n\nEarlier teleprinters had three rows of keys and only supported upper case letters. They used the 5 bit ITA2 code and generally worked at 60 to 100 words per minute. Later teleprinters, specifically the [[Teletype Model 33]], used ASCII code, an innovation that came into widespread use in the 1960s as computers became more widely available.\n\n\"Speed\", intended to be roughly comparable to [[words per minute]], is the standard term introduced by [[Western Union]] for a mechanical teleprinter data transmission rate using the 5-bit ITA2 code that was popular in the 1940s and for several decades thereafter. Such a machine would send 1 start bit, 5 data bits, and 1.42 stop bits. This unusual stop bit time is actually a rest period to allow the mechanical printing mechanism to synchronize in the event that a garbled signal is received.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samhallas.co.uk/repository/telegraph/introduction_to_RTTY.pdf |title= Introduction to RTTY}}</ref> This is true especially on [[High frequency]] radio circuits where selective fading is present. Selective fading causes the mark signal amplitude to be randomly different from the space signal amplitude. Selective fading, or [[Rayleigh fading]] can cause two carriers to randomly and independently fade to different depths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w7ay.net/site/Technical/RTTY%20Demodulators/index.html |title= RTTY Demodulators}}</ref> Since modern computer equipment cannot easily generate 1.42 bits for the stop period, common practice is to either approximate this with 1.5 bits, or to send 2.0 bits while accepting 1.0 bits receiving.\n\nFor example, a \"60 speed\" machine is geared at 45.5 [[baud]] (22.0 [[millisecond|ms]] per bit), a \"66 speed\" machine is geared at 50.0 [[baud]] (20.0 ms per bit), a \"75 speed\" machine is geared at 56.9 baud (17.5 ms per bit), a \"100 speed\" machine is geared at 74.2 baud (13.5 ms per bit), and a \"133 speed\" machine is geared at 100.0 baud (10.0 ms per bit). 60 speed became the ''de facto'' standard for [[amateur radio]] [[radioteletype|RTTY]] operation because of the widespread availability of equipment at that speed and the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) restrictions to only 60 speed from 1953 to 1972. Telex, [[news agency]] wires and similar services commonly used 66 speed services. There was some migration to 75 and 100 speed as more reliable devices were introduced. However, the limitations of HF transmission such as excessive error rates due to multipath distortion and the nature of ionospheric propagation kept many users at 60 and 66 speed. Most audio recordings in existence today are of teleprinters operating at 60 words per minute, and mostly of the Teletype Model 15.\n\nAnother measure of the speed of a teletypewriter was in total \"operations per minute (OPM)\". For example, 60 speed was usually 368 OPM, 66 speed was 404 OPM, 75 speed was 460 OPM, and 100 speed was 600 OPM. Western Union Telexes were usually set at 390 OPM, with 7.0 total bits instead of the customary 7.42 bits.\n\nBoth wire-service and private teleprinters had bells to signal important incoming messages and could ring 24/7 while the power was turned on. For example, ringing 4 bells on UPI wire-service machines meant an \"Urgent\" message; 5 bells was a \"Bulletin\"; and 10 bells was a FLASH, used only for very important news, such as the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].\n\nThe teleprinter circuit was often linked to a 5-bit [[punched tape|paper tape]] punch (or \"reperforator\") and reader, allowing messages received to be resent on another circuit. Complex military and commercial communications networks were built using this technology. Message centers had rows of teleprinters and large racks for paper tapes awaiting transmission. Skilled operators could read the priority code from the hole pattern and might even feed a \"FLASH PRIORITY\" tape into a reader while it was still coming out of the punch. Routine traffic often had to wait hours for relay. Many teleprinters had built-in paper tape readers and punches, allowing messages to be saved in machine-readable form and edited [[off-line]].\n\nCommunication by radio, known as ''[[radioteletype]]'' or ''RTTY'' (pronounced ''ritty''), was also common, especially among military users. Ships, command posts (mobile, stationary, and even airborne) and logistics units took advantage of the ability of operators to send reliable and accurate information with a minimum of training. [[Amateur radio]] operators continue to use this mode of communication today, though most use computer-interface sound generators, rather than legacy hardware teleprinter equipment.  Numerous modes are in use within the \"ham radio\" community, from the original ITA2 format to more modern, faster modes, which include error-checking of characters.\n\n===Control characters===\n{{Main|Control character}}\nA typewriter or electromechanical printer can print characters on paper, and execute operations such as move the carriage back to the left margin of the same line ([[carriage return]]), advance to the same column of the next line ([[line feed]]), and so on. Commands to control non-printing operations were transmitted in exactly the same way as printable characters by sending control characters with defined functions (e.g., the ''line feed'' character forced the carriage to move to the same position on the next line) to teleprinters. In modern computing and communications a few control characters, such as carriage return and line feed, have retained their original functions (although they are often implemented in software rather than activating electromechanical mechanisms to move a physical printer carriage) but many others are no longer required and are used for other purposes.\n\n===Answer back mechanism===\nSome teleprinters had a \"Here is\" key, which transmitted a fixed sequence of 20 or 22 characters, programmable by breaking tabs off a drum. This sequence could also be transmitted automatically upon receipt of an [[Enquiry character|ENQ]] (control E) signal, if enabled.<ref name=\"Hereis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdp8.net/asr33/pics/main_back.shtml |title=ASR 33 Teletype Rear View of Main Assembly}}</ref><ref name=\"AnotherHereis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.k7tty.com/development/teletype/model-32/index.html |title=Teletype Model 32ASR}}</ref> This was commonly used to identify a station; the operator could press the key to send the station identifier to the other end, or the remote station could trigger its transmission by sending the ENQ character, essentially asking \"who are you?\"\n\n==Manufacturers==\n\n===Creed & Company===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0516-500, Fernschreibmaschine mit Telefonanschluss.jpg|thumb|A British [[Creed & Company]] Teleprinter No. 7 in 1930]]\n[[Creed & Company]], a British company, built teleprinters for the [[General Post Office|GPO]]'s teleprinter service.<ref>{{Citation |title= Baudot.net: Creed & Company, Ltd. |url= http://www.baudot.net/creed.htm }}</ref>\n* Creed model 7 (page printing teleprinter introduced in 1931)\n* Creed model 7B (50 baud page printing teleprinter) \n* Creed model 7E (page printing teleprinter with overlap cam and range finder)\n* Creed model 7/TR (non-printing teleprinter reperforator)\n* Creed model 54 (page printing teleprinter introduced in 1954)\n* Creed model 75 (page printing teleprinter introduced in 1958)\n* Creed model 85 (printing reperforator introduced in 1948)\n* Creed model 86 (printing reperforator using 7/8\" wide tape)\n* Creed model 444 (page printing teleprinter introduced in 1966 - GPO type 15)\n\n===Kleinschmidt Labs===\nIn 1931 Edward Kleinschmidt formed [[Kleinschmidt Inc|Kleinschmidt Labs]] to pursue a different type design of teleprinter. In 1944 Kleinschmidt demonstrated their lightweight unit to the Signal Corps and in 1949 their design was adopted for the Army's portable needs. In 1956, Kleinschmidt Labs merged with [[Smith-Corona]], which then merged with the [[Marchant Calculator|Marchant Calculating Machine Co.]], forming the SCM Corporation. By 1979, the Kleinschmidt division was branching off into Electronic Data Interchange, a business in which they became very successful, and replaced the mechanical products, including teleprinters.\n\nKleinschmidt machines, with the military as their primary customer, used standard military designations for their machines. The teleprinter was identified with designations such as a TT-4/FG, while communication \"sets\" to which a teleprinter might be a part generally used the standard Army/Navy designation system such as AN/FGC-25. This includes Kleinschmidt teleprinter TT-117/FG and tape reperforator TT-179/FG.\n\n===Morkrum===\n[[Morkrum]] made their first commercial installation of a printing telegraph with the Postal Telegraph Company in Boston and New York in 1910.<ref>{{cite book |author=Colin Hempstead, William E.

The main difference from a standard teleprinter is that Telex includes a switched routing network, originally based on pulse-telephone dialing, which in the United States was provided by Western Union. AT&T developed a competing network called \"[[Telegraphy#TWX|TWX]]\" which initially also used rotary dialing and Baudot code, carried to the customer premises as pulses of DC on a metallic copper pair. TWX later added a second ASCII-based service using [[Bell 103 modem|Bell 103]] type modems served over lines whose physical interface was identical to regular telephone lines. In many cases, the TWX service was provided by the same telephone central office that handled voice calls, using class of service to prevent [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] customers from connecting to TWX customers. Telex is still in use in some countries for certain applications such as shipping, news, weather reporting and military command. Many business applications have moved to the Internet as most countries have discontinued telex/TWX services.\n\n==Teletypesetter==\nIn addition to the 5-bit Baudot code and the much later seven-bit ASCII code, there was a six-bit code known as the Teletypesetter code (TTS)<ref>[http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinventions/a/printing.htm The History of Printing and Printing Processes], retrieved 2008 July 15</ref> used by news wire services.

[[Punched card]] readers and fast printers replaced teleprinters for most purposes, but teleprinters continued to be used as interactive [[time-sharing]] [[computer terminal|terminals]] until video [[computer display|displays]] became widely available in the late 1970s.\n\nUsers typed commands after a [[Command-line interface#Command prompt|prompt]] character was printed. Printing was unidirectional; if the user wanted to delete what had been typed, further characters were printed to indicate that previous text had been cancelled. When video displays first became available the user interface was initially exactly the same as for an electromechanical printer; expensive and scarce video terminals could be used interchangeably with teleprinters. This was the origin of the [[text terminal]] and the [[command-line interface]].\n\nPaper tape was sometimes used to prepare input for the computer session off line and to capture computer output. The popular [[Teletype Model 33]] used 7-bit [[ASCII]] code (with an eighth [[parity bit]]) instead of Baudot. The common [[modem]] communications settings, ''Start/Stop Bits'' and ''Parity,'' stem from the Teletype era.\n\nIn early operating systems such as [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital's]] [[RT-11]], serial communication lines were often connected to teleprinters and were given device names starting with <tt>tt</tt>. This and similar conventions were adopted by many other operating systems. [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s use the [[prefix]] <tt>tty</tt>, for example <tt>/dev/tty13</tt>, or <tt>pty</tt> (for pseudo-tty), such as <tt>/dev/ptya0</tt>. In many computing contexts, \"TTY\" has become the name for any text terminal, such as an external [[system console|console]] device, a user dialing into the system on a [[modem]] on a [[serial port]] device, a printing or graphical [[computer terminal]] on a computer's serial port or the [[RS-232]] port on a [[USB]]-to-RS-232 converter attached to a computer's USB port, or even a [[terminal emulator]] application in the window system using a [[pseudoterminal]] device.\n\nTeleprinters were also used to record fault printout and other information in some [[TXE]] telephone exchanges.\n\n==Obsolescence of teleprinters==\n\nAlthough printing news, messages, and other text at a distance is still universal, the dedicated teleprinter tied to a pair of leased copper wires was made functionally obsolete by the [[fax]], personal computer, [[inkjet printer]], [[email]], and the Internet.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[packet radio]] became the most common form of digital communications used in amateur radio. Soon, advanced multimode electronic interfaces such as the AEA PK-232 were developed, which could send and receive not only packet, but various other modulation types including [[baudot code|Baudot]]. This made it possible for a home or laptop computer to replace teleprinters, saving money, complexity, space and the massive amount of paper which mechanical machines used.\n\nAs a result, by the mid-1990s, amateur use of actual teleprinters had waned, though a core of \"purists\" still operate on equipment originally manufactured in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.\n\nDespite the obsolescence of teleprinters by the 21st century, its distinctive sound continues to be played in the background of newscasts on the New York City radio station [[WINS (AM)|WINS]], and Philadelphia's [[KYW (AM)|KYW]], a tradition dating back to the mid-1960s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Letter-quality printer]]\n* [[Plan 55-A]], a [[message switching]] system for telegrams.\n* [[Radioteletype]]\n* [[Siemens and Halske T52]] \u2013 the ''Geheimfernschreiber'' (''secrets teleprinter'')\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=g_EDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA577#v=onepage&f=true \"Teletype Messages Sent Through Switch Board\"], ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', April 1932.

Initially they were used in [[telegraphy]], which developed in the late 1830s and 1840s as the first use of [[electrical engineering]]<ref>{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= Steven |author-link= Stephen Roberts (historian) |title= Distant Writing|url= http://distantwriting.co.uk/index.htm }}</ref>, though teleprinters weren't used for telegraphy until 1887 at the earliest.<ref>{{Citation |last=Nelson |first= R.A. |title= History Of Teletype Development |url= https://www.thocp.net/hardware/history_of_teletype_development_.htm}}</ref> The machines were adapted to provide a [[user interface]] to early [[mainframe computer]]s and [[minicomputer]]s, sending typed data to the computer and printing the response. Some models could also be used to create [[punched tape]] for [[Computer data storage|data storage]] (either from typed input or from data received from a remote source) and to read back such tape for local printing or transmission.\n\nTeleprinters could use a variety of different communication media. These included a simple pair of wires; dedicated non-switched telephone circuits (leased lines); [[switched communication network|switched networks]] that operated similarly to the [[public telephone network]] ([[telex]]); and radio and [[microwave]] links (telex-on-radio, or TOR). A teleprinter attached to a [[modem]] could also communicate through standard switched public telephone lines. This latter configuration was often used to connect teleprinters to remote computers, particularly in [[time-sharing]] environments.\n\nTeleprinters have largely been replaced by fully electronic [[computer terminal]]s which typically have a [[computer monitor]] instead of a printer (though the term \"TTY\" is still occasionally used to refer to them, such as in [[Unix]] systems). Teleprinters are still widely used in the aviation industry (see [[Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network|AFTN]] and [[airline teletype system]]), and variations called [[Telecommunications device for the deaf|Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf]] (TDDs) are used by the [[hearing loss|hearing impaired]] for typed communications over ordinary telephone lines.\n\n==History==\nThe teleprinter evolved through a series of inventions by a number of engineers, including [[Samuel Morse]], [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], [[Royal Earl House]], [[David Edward Hughes]], [[Emile Baudot]], [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]], [[Charles L. Krum]], [[Edward Kleinschmidt]] and [[Frederick G. Creed]]. Teleprinters were invented in order to send and receive messages without the need for operators trained in the use of Morse code. A system of two teleprinters, with one operator trained to use a keyboard, replaced two trained Morse code operators. The teleprinter system improved message speed and delivery time, making it possible for messages to be flashed across a country with little manual intervention.<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\">{{Citation| title = Typewriter May Soon Be Transmitter of Telegrams | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = January 25, 1914| url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/01/25/100081424.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThere were a number of parallel developments on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In 1835 [[Samuel Morse]] devised a recording telegraph, and [[Morse code]] was born.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co32957/type-used-for-original-morse-telegraph-1835-movable-type|title=Type used for original morse telegraph, 1835|website=[[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]|access-date=2017-12-05|quote=Samuel Morse was one of the pioneers of electric telegraphy.

Cooke & Wheatstone received a British patent covering telegraphy in 1837 and a second one in 1840 which described a type-printing telegraph with steel type fixed at the tips of petals of a rotating brass daisy-wheel, struck by an \u201celectric hammer\u201d to print Roman letters through carbon paper onto a moving paper tape. In 1841 [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] devised an electromagnetic printing telegraph machine. It used pulses of electricity created by rotating a dial over contact points to release and stop a type-wheel turned by weight-driven clockwork; a second clockwork mechanism rotated a drum covered with a sheet of paper and moved it slowly upwards so that the type-wheel printed its signals in a spiral. The critical issue was to have the sending and receiving elements working synchronously. Bain attempted to achieve this using [[centrifugal governor]]s to closely regulate the speed of the clockwork. It was patented, along with other devices, on April 21, 1841.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://distantwriting.co.uk/bain.html|title=Distant Writing - Bain|author=Steven Roberts}}</ref>\n\nBy 1846, the [[Samuel Morse|Morse]] telegraph service was operational between Washington, D.C., and New York. [[Royal Earl House]] patented his [[printing telegraph]] that same year. He linked two 28-key piano-style keyboards by wire. Each piano key represented a letter of the alphabet and when pressed caused the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. A \"shift\" key gave each main key two optional values. A 56-character typewheel at the sending end was synchronised to coincide with a similar wheel at the receiving end. If the key corresponding to a particular character was pressed at the home station, it actuated the typewheel at the distant station just as the same character moved into the printing position, in a way similar to the [[daisy wheel printer]]. It was thus an example of a synchronous data transmission system. House's equipment could transmit around 40 instantly readable words per minute, but was difficult to manufacture in bulk. The printer could copy and print out up to 2,000 words per hour. This invention was first put in operation and exhibited at the [[Mechanics Institute]] in New York in 1844.\n\nLandline teleprinter operations began in 1849, when a circuit was put in service between Philadelphia and New York City.<ref>''RTTY Journal'' Vol. 25 No. 9, October 1977: 2.</ref>\n\n[[File:Printing Telegraph.jpg|thumb|[[David Edward Hughes|Hughes]] telegraph, an early (1855) teleprinter built by Siemens and Halske.

In less than two years, a number of small telegraph companies, including [[Western Union]] in early stages of development, united to form one large corporation \u2013 Western Union Telegraph Co. \u2013 to carry on the business of telegraphy on the Hughes system.<ref name=\"Clarkson\">{{cite web | url = http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html | title = David Edward Hughes | accessdate =September 29, 2010 | date = April 14, 2007 | publisher = Clarkson University | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html | archivedate = April 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn France, [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] designed in 1874 a system using a five-unit code, which began to be used extensively in that country from 1877. The British Post Office adopted the Baudot system for use on a simplex circuit between London and Paris in 1897, and subsequently made considerable use of duplex Baudot systems on their Inland Telegraph Services.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hobbs  |first=Alan G. |title=Five-unit codes|url=http://www.nadcomm.com/fiveunit/fiveunits.htm| accessdate =May 1, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDuring 1901, Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]] (1865\u20131945, originally from New Zealand), prompted by his development of a typewriter-like keyboard. The Murray system employed an intermediate step, a keyboard perforator, which allowed an operator to punch a [[paper tape]], and a tape transmitter for sending the message from the punched tape. At the receiving end of the line, a printing mechanism would print on a paper tape, and/or a reperforator could be used to make a perforated copy of the message.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Foster |first=Maximilian |date=August 1901 |title=A Successful Printing Telegraph |magazine=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=II |pages=1195\u20131199 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IF6tNZnhO7wC&pg=PA1195|accessdate=July 9, 2009 |quote= }}</ref> As there was no longer a direct correlation between the operator's hand movement and the bits transmitted, there was no concern about arranging the code to minimize operator fatigue, and instead Murray designed the code to minimize wear on the machinery, assigning the code combinations with the fewest punched holes to the most [[letter frequencies|frequently used characters]]. The Murray code also introduced what became known as \"format effectors\" or \"[[control character]]s\" \u2013 the [[Carriage return|CR]] (Carriage Return) and [[Newline|LF]] (Line Feed) codes. A few of Baudot's codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent.<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\"/>\n\nIn the United States in 1902, electrical engineer Frank Pearne approached [[Joy Morton]], head of [[Morton Salt]], seeking a sponsor for research into the practicalities of developing a [[printing telegraph]] system. Joy Morton needed to determine whether this was worthwhile and so consulted mechanical engineer [[Charles L. Krum]], who was vice president of the Western Cold Storage Company. Krum was interested in helping Pearne, so space was set up in a laboratory in the attic of Western Cold Storage. Frank Pearne lost interest in the project after a year and left to get involved in teaching. Krum was prepared to continue Pearne\u2019s work, and in August, 1903 a patent was filed for a 'typebar page printer'.<ref>{{cite web |\nurl=https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00888335 | title=U.S. Patent 888,335 issued in May, 1908| accessdate=July 14, 2019}}</ref> In 1904, Krum filed a patent for a 'type wheel printing telegraph machine'<ref>{{cite web |\nurl=https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00862402 | title=U.S. Patent 862,402| accessdate=July 14, 2019}}</ref> which was issued in August, 1907.

Creed]], entered the teleprinter field with their Model 1P, a page printer, which was soon superseded by the improved Model 2P. In 1925 Creed acquired the patents for Donald Murray's Murray code, a rationalised Baudot code. The Model 3 tape printer, Creed\u2019s first combined start-stop machine, was introduced in 1927 for the Post Office telegram service. This machine printed received messages directly on to gummed paper tape at a rate of 65 words per minute. Creed created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the [[Daily Mail]] for daily transmission of the newspaper's contents. The Creed Model 7 page printing teleprinter was introduced in 1931 and was used for the inland [[Telex]] service. It worked at a speed of 50 baud, about 66 words a minute, using a code based on the Murray code.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nA teleprinter system was installed in the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] Flight Service Station Airway Radio Stations system in 1928, carrying administrative messages, flight information and weather reports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atchistory.org/History/fsshist.htm|title= Flight Service History 1920-1998}}</ref> By 1938, the FAA's teleprinter network, handling weather traffic, extended over 20,000 miles, covering all 48 states except Maine, New Hampshire, and South Dakota.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf|title=FAA HISTORICAL CHRONOLOGY, 1926-1996}}</ref>\n\n==Ways in which teleprinters were used==\nThere were at least five major types of teleprinter networks:\n* Exchange systems such as [[Telex]] and [[Telex#Teletypewriter eXchange|TWX]] created a real-time circuit between two machines, so that anything typed on one machine appeared at the other end immediately. US and UK systems had telephone dials, and prior to 1981 five [[North American Numbering Plan]] (NANPA) [[area codes]] were reserved for teleprinter use. German systems did \"dialing\" via the keyboard. Typed \"chat\" was possible, but because billing was by connect time, it was common to prepare messages in advance on [[Punched tape|paper tape]] and transmit them without pauses for typing.\n* [[Leased line]] and [[radioteletype]] networks arranged in point-to-point and / or multipoint configurations supported [[data processing]] applications for government and industry, such as integrating the accounting, billing, management, production, purchasing, sales, shipping and receiving departments within an organization to speed internal communications.\n* [[Message switching]] systems were an early form of E-mail, using electromechanical equipment. See [[Telegram]], [[Western Union]], [[Plan 55-A]]. Military organizations had similar but separate systems, such as [[Autodin]].\n* Broadcast systems such as weather information distribution and \"news wires\". Examples were operated by [[Associated Press]], [[National Weather Service]], [[Reuters]], and United Press (later [[UPI]]). Information was printed on receive-only teleprinters, without keyboards or dials.\n* \"Loop\" systems, where anything typed on any machine on the loop printed on all the machines. American police departments used such systems to interconnect precincts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Signaling system |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US2364357A/en |accessdate=7 February 2019 |date=29 March 1944}}</ref>\n\n==Teleprinter operation==\n[[Image:Baudotkeyboard.png|right|frame|422px|[[Alphanumeric keyboard|Keyboard]] of a [[Baudot code|Baudot teleprinter]], with 32 keys, including the space bar]]\n[[File:International Telegraph Alphabet 2 brightened.jpg|thumb|International Telegraph Alphabet 2 development of the Baudot-Murray code]]\nMost teleprinters used the 5-[[bit]] [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA2). This limited the character set to 32 codes (2<sup>5</sup> = 32). One had to use a \"FIGS\" (for \"figures\") [[shift key]] to type numbers and special characters. Special versions of teleprinters had FIGS characters for specific applications, such as weather symbols for weather reports. Print quality was poor by modern standards. The ITA2 code was used [[asynchronous start-stop|asynchronously with start and stop bits]]: the asynchronous code design was intimately linked with the start-stop electro-mechanical design of teleprinters. (Early systems had used synchronous codes, but were hard to synchronize mechanically). Other codes, such as [[FIELDATA]] and [[Flexowriter]], were introduced but never became as popular as ITA2.\n\n''Mark'' and ''space'' are terms describing [[logic level]]s in teleprinter circuits. The native mode of communication for a teleprinter is a simple series [[direct current circuit|DC circuit]] that is interrupted, much as a [[rotary dial]] interrupts a telephone signal. The marking condition is when the circuit is closed (current is flowing), the spacing condition is when the circuit is open (no current is flowing). The \"idle\" condition of the circuit is a continuous marking state, with the start of a character signalled by a \"start bit\", which is always a space. Following the start bit, the character is represented by a fixed number of bits, such as 5 bits in the ITA2 code, each either a mark or a space to denote the specific character or machine function. After the character's bits, the sending machine sends one or more stop bits. The stop bits are marking, so as to be distinct from the subsequent start bit. If the sender has nothing more to send, the line simply remains in the marking state (as if a continuing series of stop bits) until a later space denotes the start of the next character. The time between characters need not be an integral multiple of a bit time, but it must be at least the minimum number of stop bits required by the receiving machine.\n\nWhen the line is broken, the continuous spacing (open circuit, no current flowing) causes a receiving teleprinter to cycle continuously, even in the absence of stop bits. It prints nothing because the characters received are all zeros, the ITA2 blank (or [[ASCII]]) [[null character]].\n\nTeleprinter circuits were generally leased from a communications [[common carrier]] and consisted of ordinary [[telephone cable]]s that extended from the teleprinter located at the customer location to the common carrier [[telephone exchange|central office]]. These teleprinter circuits were connected to switching equipment at the central office for [[Telex]] and [[Telegraphy#TWX|TWX]] service. [[Private line]] teleprinter circuits were not directly connected to switching equipment. Instead, these private line circuits were connected to [[network hub]]s and [[repeater]]s configured to provide point to point or point to multipoint service. More than two teleprinters could be connected to the same wire circuit by means of a [[current loop]].\n\nEarlier teleprinters had three rows of keys and only supported upper case letters. They used the 5 bit ITA2 code and generally worked at 60 to 100 words per minute. Later teleprinters, specifically the [[Teletype Model 33]], used ASCII code, an innovation that came into widespread use in the 1960s as computers became more widely available.\n\n\"Speed\", intended to be roughly comparable to [[words per minute]], is the standard term introduced by [[Western Union]] for a mechanical teleprinter data transmission rate using the 5-bit ITA2 code that was popular in the 1940s and for several decades thereafter. Such a machine would send 1 start bit, 5 data bits, and 1.42 stop bits. This unusual stop bit time is actually a rest period to allow the mechanical printing mechanism to synchronize in the event that a garbled signal is received.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samhallas.co.uk/repository/telegraph/introduction_to_RTTY.pdf |title= Introduction to RTTY}}</ref> This is true especially on [[High frequency]] radio circuits where selective fading is present. Selective fading causes the mark signal amplitude to be randomly different from the space signal amplitude. Selective fading, or [[Rayleigh fading]] can cause two carriers to randomly and independently fade to different depths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w7ay.net/site/Technical/RTTY%20Demodulators/index.html |title= RTTY Demodulators}}</ref> Since modern computer equipment cannot easily generate 1.42 bits for the stop period, common practice is to either approximate this with 1.5 bits, or to send 2.0 bits while accepting 1.0 bits receiving.\n\nFor example, a \"60 speed\" machine is geared at 45.5 [[baud]] (22.0 [[millisecond|ms]] per bit), a \"66 speed\" machine is geared at 50.0 [[baud]] (20.0 ms per bit), a \"75 speed\" machine is geared at 56.9 baud (17.5 ms per bit), a \"100 speed\" machine is geared at 74.2 baud (13.5 ms per bit), and a \"133 speed\" machine is geared at 100.0 baud (10.0 ms per bit). 60 speed became the ''de facto'' standard for [[amateur radio]] [[radioteletype|RTTY]] operation because of the widespread availability of equipment at that speed and the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) restrictions to only 60 speed from 1953 to 1972. Telex, [[news agency]] wires and similar services commonly used 66 speed services. There was some migration to 75 and 100 speed as more reliable devices were introduced. However, the limitations of HF transmission such as excessive error rates due to multipath distortion and the nature of ionospheric propagation kept many users at 60 and 66 speed. Most audio recordings in existence today are of teleprinters operating at 60 words per minute, and mostly of the Teletype Model 15.\n\nAnother measure of the speed of a teletypewriter was in total \"operations per minute (OPM)\". For example, 60 speed was usually 368 OPM, 66 speed was 404 OPM, 75 speed was 460 OPM, and 100 speed was 600 OPM. Western Union Telexes were usually set at 390 OPM, with 7.0 total bits instead of the customary 7.42 bits.\n\nBoth wire-service and private teleprinters had bells to signal important incoming messages and could ring 24/7 while the power was turned on. For example, ringing 4 bells on UPI wire-service machines meant an \"Urgent\" message; 5 bells was a \"Bulletin\"; and 10 bells was a FLASH, used only for very important news, such as the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].\n\nThe teleprinter circuit was often linked to a 5-bit [[punched tape|paper tape]] punch (or \"reperforator\") and reader, allowing messages received to be resent on another circuit. Complex military and commercial communications networks were built using this technology. Message centers had rows of teleprinters and large racks for paper tapes awaiting transmission. Skilled operators could read the priority code from the hole pattern and might even feed a \"FLASH PRIORITY\" tape into a reader while it was still coming out of the punch. Routine traffic often had to wait hours for relay. Many teleprinters had built-in paper tape readers and punches, allowing messages to be saved in machine-readable form and edited [[off-line]].\n\nCommunication by radio, known as ''[[radioteletype]]'' or ''RTTY'' (pronounced ''ritty''), was also common, especially among military users. Ships, command posts (mobile, stationary, and even airborne) and logistics units took advantage of the ability of operators to send reliable and accurate information with a minimum of training. [[Amateur radio]] operators continue to use this mode of communication today, though most use computer-interface sound generators, rather than legacy hardware teleprinter equipment.  Numerous modes are in use within the \"ham radio\" community, from the original ITA2 format to more modern, faster modes, which include error-checking of characters.\n\n===Control characters===\n{{Main|Control character}}\nA typewriter or electromechanical printer can print characters on paper, and execute operations such as move the carriage back to the left margin of the same line ([[carriage return]]), advance to the same column of the next line ([[line feed]]), and so on. Commands to control non-printing operations were transmitted in exactly the same way as printable characters by sending control characters with defined functions (e.g., the ''line feed'' character forced the carriage to move to the same position on the next line) to teleprinters. In modern computing and communications a few control characters, such as carriage return and line feed, have retained their original functions (although they are often implemented in software rather than activating electromechanical mechanisms to move a physical printer carriage) but many others are no longer required and are used for other purposes.\n\n===Answer back mechanism===\nSome teleprinters had a \"Here is\" key, which transmitted a fixed sequence of 20 or 22 characters, programmable by breaking tabs off a drum. This sequence could also be transmitted automatically upon receipt of an [[Enquiry character|ENQ]] (control E) signal, if enabled.<ref name=\"Hereis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdp8.net/asr33/pics/main_back.shtml |title=ASR 33 Teletype Rear View of Main Assembly}}</ref><ref name=\"AnotherHereis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.k7tty.com/development/teletype/model-32/index.html |title=Teletype Model 32ASR}}</ref> This was commonly used to identify a station; the operator could press the key to send the station identifier to the other end, or the remote station could trigger its transmission by sending the ENQ character, essentially asking \"who are you?\"\n\n==Manufacturers==\n\n===Creed & Company===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0516-500, Fernschreibmaschine mit Telefonanschluss.jpg|thumb|A British [[Creed & Company]] Teleprinter No. 7 in 1930]]\n[[Creed & Company]], a British company, built teleprinters for the [[General Post Office|GPO]]'s teleprinter service.<ref>{{Citation |title= Baudot.net: Creed & Company, Ltd. |url= http://www.baudot.net/creed.htm }}</ref>\n* Creed model 7 (page printing teleprinter introduced in 1931)\n* Creed model 7B (50 baud page printing teleprinter) \n* Creed model 7E (page printing teleprinter with overlap cam and range finder)\n* Creed model 7/TR (non-printing teleprinter reperforator)\n* Creed model 54 (page printing teleprinter introduced in 1954)\n* Creed model 75 (page printing teleprinter introduced in 1958)\n* Creed model 85 (printing reperforator introduced in 1948)\n* Creed model 86 (printing reperforator using 7/8\" wide tape)\n* Creed model 444 (page printing teleprinter introduced in 1966 - GPO type 15)\n\n===Kleinschmidt Labs===\nIn 1931 Edward Kleinschmidt formed [[Kleinschmidt Inc|Kleinschmidt Labs]] to pursue a different type design of teleprinter. In 1944 Kleinschmidt demonstrated their lightweight unit to the Signal Corps and in 1949 their design was adopted for the Army's portable needs. In 1956, Kleinschmidt Labs merged with [[Smith-Corona]], which then merged with the [[Marchant Calculator|Marchant Calculating Machine Co.]], forming the SCM Corporation. By 1979, the Kleinschmidt division was branching off into Electronic Data Interchange, a business in which they became very successful, and replaced the mechanical products, including teleprinters.\n\nKleinschmidt machines, with the military as their primary customer, used standard military designations for their machines. The teleprinter was identified with designations such as a TT-4/FG, while communication \"sets\" to which a teleprinter might be a part generally used the standard Army/Navy designation system such as AN/FGC-25. This includes Kleinschmidt teleprinter TT-117/FG and tape reperforator TT-179/FG.\n\n===Morkrum===\n[[Morkrum]] made their first commercial installation of a printing telegraph with the Postal Telegraph Company in Boston and New York in 1910.<ref>{{cite book |author=Colin Hempstead, William E.

In 1930, Teletype Corporation was purchased by the [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] and became a subsidiary of [[Western Electric]].

The production run was stretched somewhat by World War II\u2014the Model 28 was scheduled to replace the Model 15 in the mid-1940s, but Teletype built so many factories to produce the Model 15 during World War II, it was more economical to continue mass production of the Model 15.

There is at least one item that points to Telex using Teleprinter#Telex as the link. (probably should be redirected to telegraphy--agr) -->\nA global teleprinter network, called the \"[[Telegraphy#Teleprinters|Telex network]]\", was developed in the late 1920s, and was used through most of the 20th century for business communications. The main difference from a standard teleprinter is that Telex includes a switched routing network, originally based on pulse-telephone dialing, which in the United States was provided by Western Union. AT&T developed a competing network called \"[[Telegraphy#TWX|TWX]]\" which initially also used rotary dialing and Baudot code, carried to the customer premises as pulses of DC on a metallic copper pair. TWX later added a second ASCII-based service using [[Bell 103 modem|Bell 103]] type modems served over lines whose physical interface was identical to regular telephone lines. In many cases, the TWX service was provided by the same telephone central office that handled voice calls, using class of service to prevent [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] customers from connecting to TWX customers. Telex is still in use in some countries for certain applications such as shipping, news, weather reporting and military command. Many business applications have moved to the Internet as most countries have discontinued telex/TWX services.\n\n==Teletypesetter==\nIn addition to the 5-bit Baudot code and the much later seven-bit ASCII code, there was a six-bit code known as the Teletypesetter code (TTS)<ref>[http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinventions/a/printing.htm The History of Printing and Printing Processes], retrieved 2008 July 15</ref> used by news wire services.

Originally these machines would simply punch paper tapes and these tapes could be read by a tape reader attached to a \"Teletypesetter operating unit\" installed on a [[Linotype machine]]. The \"operating unit\" was essentially a box full of solenoids that sat on top of the Linotype's keyboard and pressed the appropriate keys in response to the codes read from the tape, thus creating type for printing in newspapers and magazines.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.smecc.org/teletypes_in_typesetting.htm |title=Teletypes in Typesetting |author=Doug Kerr |publisher=Southwest Museum of Engineering, Communications and Computation | publication-place=Glendale, Arizona, USA |access-date=2017-04-25 }}</ref>\n\nIn later years the incoming 6-bit current loop signal carrying the TTS code was connected to a minicomputer or mainframe for storage, editing, and eventual feed to a phototypesetting machine.\n\n==Teleprinters in computing==<!-- This section is linked from [[Line printer]] -->\n[[File:ASR-33 Teletype terminal IMG 1658.jpg|thumb|A Teletype Model 33 ASR with paper tape reader and punch, as used for early [[modem]]-based computing]]\nComputers used teleprinters for input and output from the early days of computing. [[Punched card]] readers and fast printers replaced teleprinters for most purposes, but teleprinters continued to be used as interactive [[time-sharing]] [[computer terminal|terminals]] until video [[computer display|displays]] became widely available in the late 1970s.\n\nUsers typed commands after a [[Command-line interface#Command prompt|prompt]] character was printed. Printing was unidirectional; if the user wanted to delete what had been typed, further characters were printed to indicate that previous text had been cancelled. When video displays first became available the user interface was initially exactly the same as for an electromechanical printer; expensive and scarce video terminals could be used interchangeably with teleprinters. This was the origin of the [[text terminal]] and the [[command-line interface]].\n\nPaper tape was sometimes used to prepare input for the computer session off line and to capture computer output. The popular [[Teletype Model 33]] used 7-bit [[ASCII]] code (with an eighth [[parity bit]]) instead of Baudot. The common [[modem]] communications settings, ''Start/Stop Bits'' and ''Parity,'' stem from the Teletype era.\n\nIn early operating systems such as [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital's]] [[RT-11]], serial communication lines were often connected to teleprinters and were given device names starting with <tt>tt</tt>. This and similar conventions were adopted by many other operating systems. [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s use the [[prefix]] <tt>tty</tt>, for example <tt>/dev/tty13</tt>, or <tt>pty</tt> (for pseudo-tty), such as <tt>/dev/ptya0</tt>. In many computing contexts, \"TTY\" has become the name for any text terminal, such as an external [[system console|console]] device, a user dialing into the system on a [[modem]] on a [[serial port]] device, a printing or graphical [[computer terminal]] on a computer's serial port or the [[RS-232]] port on a [[USB]]-to-RS-232 converter attached to a computer's USB port, or even a [[terminal emulator]] application in the window system using a [[pseudoterminal]] device.\n\nTeleprinters were also used to record fault printout and other information in some [[TXE]] telephone exchanges.\n\n==Obsolescence of teleprinters==\n\nAlthough printing news, messages, and other text at a distance is still universal, the dedicated teleprinter tied to a pair of leased copper wires was made functionally obsolete by the [[fax]], personal computer, [[inkjet printer]], [[email]], and the Internet.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[packet radio]] became the most common form of digital communications used in amateur radio. Soon, advanced multimode electronic interfaces such as the AEA PK-232 were developed, which could send and receive not only packet, but various other modulation types including Baudot. This made it possible for a home or laptop computer to replace teleprinters, saving money, complexity, space and the massive amount of paper which mechanical machines used.\n\nAs a result, by the mid-1990s, amateur use of actual teleprinters had waned, though a core of \"purists\" still operate on equipment originally manufactured in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.\n\nDespite the obsolescence of teleprinters by the 21st century, its distinctive sound continues to be played in the background of newscasts on the New York City radio station [[WINS (AM)|WINS]], and Philadelphia's [[KYW (AM)|KYW]], a tradition dating back to the mid-1960s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Letter-quality printer]]\n* [[Plan 55-A]], a [[message switching]] system for telegrams.\n* [[Radioteletype]]\n* [[Siemens and Halske T52]] \u2013 the ''Geheimfernschreiber'' (''secrets teleprinter'')\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=g_EDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA577#v=onepage&f=true \"Teletype Messages Sent Through Switch Board\"], ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', April 1932.
