It was compiled by the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan dynasty]] historian and minister [[Toqto'a (Yuan Dynasty)|Toqto'a]].\n\n==History of compilation==\nAlthough the Jin dynasty was destroyed by the [[Mongols]] in 1234, the initiative for writing a dynastic history - in accordance with Chinese political traditions - was only begun under [[Kublai Khan]], who had decided to embrace Chinese political norms and found the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan dynasty]]. In 1261 the idea of compiling histories for both the Jin and [[Liao Dynasty|Liao]] dynasties was first mooted, and after the conquest of [[Southern Song]], the project was expanded to compile all three histories.\n\nIssues with the format and rules of compilation, however, hampered progress, and it was only in 1343 that the imperial commission was finalised, with Toqto'a as the overseer, and a team of six, including the scholar [[Ouyang Xuan]], as chief compilers. The work was completed in just over a year.\n\nFor its material, the ''History of Jin'' drew heavily on the historical records of the Jin dynasty itself, while the events of its final years drew heavily on the private works and records of scholars such as [[Yuan Haowen]], Liu Qi, [[Yang Huan]] and others.\n\nThe ''History of Jin'' was translated into [[Manchu language|Manchu]] as {{MongolUnicode|\u1820\u1873\u1830\u1873\u1828<br>\u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828 {{zwj}}\u200d\u1873<br>\u1830\u1860\u1869\u1860\u1875\u1873}} (Wylie: ''Aisin gurun i suduri'', [[Transliterations of Manchu|M\u00f6llendorff]]: ''Aisin gurun i suduri'').\n\nThe [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] used the [[Manchu language]] to \"correct\" Chinese character transcriptions of [[Jurchen language]] names in the ''History of Jin'' in his \"Imperial Liao Jin Yuan Three Histories National Language Explanation\" (\u6b3d\u5b9a\u907c\u91d1\u5143\u4e09\u53f2\u570b\u8a9e\u89e3) project.\n\nQianlong's \"corrections\" ended up compounding the errors and making the transcription of some foreign words even worse.<ref>{{cite book|title=Notices of the Medi\u00e6val Geography and History of Central and Western Asia| first=E.|last=Bretschneider|volume=|year=1876|edition=|publisher=Tr\u00fcbner & Company|isbn=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R98-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA6 |pages=5\u20136 |accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref> [[Marshall Broomhall]] wrote that \"So unscientific was this work that the K'ien-lung editions of the Liao, Kin, and Y\u00fcan histories are practically useless.\"<ref name=\"Broomhall1910\">{{cite book|author=Marshall Broomhall|title=Islam in China: A Neglected Problem|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_ObcNAAAAIAAJ|year=1910|publisher=Morgan & Scott, Limited|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_ObcNAAAAIAAJ/page/n116 93]\u201394}}</ref> [[Emil Bretschneider]] demonstrated how the etymologies in the Qianlong edition were incorrect.<ref name=\"Bretschneider2013 2\">{{cite book|author=E.

A new station for the Metro Silver Line will be constructed at [[Patsaouras Transit Plaza]] close to Union Station and the current street stop at the entrance to the El Monte Busway/Alameda Street will be removed once the new station is completed; the project was originally scheduled to open in 2015, but project delays have pushed back its projected opening until spring of 2018.<ref name=MetroStartsWork>{{cite news | url = http://www.scpr.org/news/2017/01/02/67692/metro-starts-work-on-pedestrian-bridge-at-la-s-uni/ | title = Metro starts work on pedestrian bridge at LA's Union Station | first = Meghan McCarty | last = Carino | date = January 2, 2017 | work = [[KPCC|89.3 KPCC]] | publisher = Southern California Public Radio | access-date = November 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Map of the Metro Silver Line.png|thumb|left|Schematic of the El Monte Busway]]\nWhen the busway opened in 1973 it was exclusively for the use of buses.<ref name=effects>{{cite web|url=https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/3299|title=Executive Report.

In 1993 plans for a high frequency 'dual-hub' service were proposed which would operate along both busways between [[El Monte Bus Station (Los Angeles Metro station)|El Monte Bus Station]] in the east via downtown to the [[Harbor Gateway Transit Center]] in the south with buses very 2\u20133 minutes and a total journey time of about 60 minutes.

This was intended to be a 24-month experiment but it was cancelled after only 6 months in which period there had been a large increase in the number of vehicles using the lane, greatly increased journey-times and reduced average vehicle occupancy. Over this time speeds on the busway dropped from {{convert|65|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|20|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and journey times increased by 20\u201330 minutes making it slower than the regular lanes where speeds dropped from {{convert|25|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|23|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Accident rates on the busway increased significantly from zero in the six months before the experiment to five during the experiment. Foothill Transit needed to hire more drivers and stage more buses to provide busway service and the change generated over 1,000 complaints to government agencies.<ref name=effects/>\n\nThe above bill had been proposed by senator [[Hilda Solis]] and authorized by Governor [[Gray Davis]] on July 1999 and was supported many cities hoping that carpool rates would increase but had been opposed by [[Caltrans]], [[Foothill Transit]] and the Southern California Transit Advocates (a transit users' organization). As a result of the increased congestion an emergency measure (Bill 769) was passed in July 2000 to terminate the experiment during peak hours raising the occupancy required to three occupants or more between the hours of 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday, in both directions. On weekends and at other times, the two occupant rule remains. This bill was supported by Hilda Solis who had proposed the original bill. [[Motorcycles]], clean fueled vehicles, [[hybrid vehicle]]s (with the appropriate sticker), and buses (with or without passengers) are allowed on the busway at all times. The busway was however still congested during peak hours and heavily congested just before and after peak hours.\n\nThe [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]] operates between the El Monte Bus Station and the Harbor Gateway Transit Center via downtown Los Angeles using the El Monte Busway and the Harbor Busways which started operation on December 13, 2009 and ridership on both busways has steady increased. Frequencies for the Metro Silver Line have improved as a result of the increased ridership demands.\n\nThe El Monte Station was rebuilt to double its capacity to 40,000 passengers as part of the [[Metro ExpressLanes project]].

Metro Express Line 489 operates weekdays only in the peak direction, line 487 and the Silver Line operate seven days a week. Hours vary for each line. On August 2012, Metro added one additional late night trip for the Metro Silver Line each direction on Fridays and Saturdays. The trip was added as a result of Metro's successful late night service on the rail lines: [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Red Line]], [[Purple Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Purple Line]], [[Green Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Green Line]], [[Gold Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Gold Line]], [[Blue Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Blue Line]], [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Expo Line]] and Metro's other transitway line: [[Orange Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Orange Line]].\n\nThe fare structure differs between Metro Silver Line, Metro Express, Foothill Transit's Silver Streak, Foothill Transit Line 481, and Foothill Transit's Commuter Express. Fares vary based on the destination. Metro Silver Line charges $2.45 on the busway regardless of the trip length. For Metro Express Lines: 485, 487 & 489 the base fare of $1.75 is applied for passengers not traveling east of Cal State L.A. Station. Before the Metro Silver Line was implemented, former Metro Express Lines: 483, 484, and 490 charged $1.25 for the base fare for passengers not traveling east of the Cal State LA Station. Since the opening of the Metro Silver Line, Metro has been working with Foothill Transit to have each agency's pass accepted on the Metro Silver Line and Foothill Transit's Silver Streak. On October 2012, an agreement was reached with Foothill Transit to lower the Silver Streak's base fare from $2.50 to $2.45 and accept Metro's passes. Metro would begin accepting Foothill Transit's passes for the Metro Silver Line. As a result of the Foothill Transit-Metro \"Silver2Silver\" program, the Silver Streak also charges a $2.45 fare for all trips. The fare for Line 481 is $2.75, regardless of trip length. Commuter Express fares are $4.90. Metro and Foothill Transit's \"Silver2Silver\" program is only applied between the El Monte Station and Downtown Los Angeles. This is the only segment where both the Metro Silver Line and Foothill's Silver Streak run together. To make up Foothill Transit's loss of lowering the Silver Streak fare, Metro will pay Foothill Transit from subsidies coming from the Metro Express Lanes project. The year-long promotion will run through October 2013. During the time in between Metro and Foothill Transit will determine if the program is successful. If the program is deemed successful, the agreement will become permanent. This may cause Metro to consider doing a fare agreement on the Harbor busway with [[Torrance Transit]], and [[Gardena Transit]].\n\nThe El Monte Bus Station is claimed to be the busiest bus terminal west of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], with 22,000 boardings daily.<ref name=biggest>{{cite web|url=http://thesource.metro.net/2010/04/13/el-monte-bus-station-work-begins-next-week/|title=El Monte bus station work begins next week|work=The Source}}</ref>\n\n==Entrances and exits==\nThe carpool lanes of the El Monte Busway can only be entered and exited at a few points. The segment from El Monte to [[Long Beach Freeway|I-710]] is demarcated not only with two 'double yellow' lines which are typical of Southern California HOV lanes, but also an approximately {{Convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} asphalt median. The segment west of I-710 into Downtown Los Angeles is on an alignment separate from the regular lanes of the [[San Bernardino Freeway|I-10]] As part of the ExpressLanes project, this buffer zone was restriped into a travel lane.\n\nWestbound entrances are at I-605, Baldwin Ave. in El Monte, El Monte Bus Station (for buses only), Del Mar Ave. (where motorists take a ramp from street level), and I-710 (for buses only). Westbound exits are at Baldwin Ave., Fremont Ave., I-710, I-5, Vignes St., and Alameda St. Eastbound entrances are at Alameda St., Patsaouras Transit Plaza at Union Station, I-710, and Baldwin Ave. Eastbound exits are at Patsaouras Transit Plaza, I-710 (for buses only), Del Mar Ave. (where motorists take a ramp to street level), Baldwin Ave., and I-605.\n\n==List of stations, from west to east==\nThe El Monte Busway has three stations and one street stop which is located near Union Station. The current street stop will be removed once the new Silver Line station is opened in late 2016 as part of the Metro Express Lanes project.<ref name=\"Patsaouras\">{{cite web |url=http://media.metro.net/board/Items/2015/01_january/20150127othersectormeet&conferitem4.pdf |title=Patsaouras Plaza Bus Station Quarterly Service Council Meet & Confer\u2013 January 2015 |publisher=[[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metro]] & [[Caltrans]] |format=pdf |pages=9\u201310 |date=January 2015 |accessdate=February 7, 2015}}</ref> Metro and Foothill Transit's \"Silver 2 Silver\" program applies on the entire segment of the El Monte Busway.

Metro Express Line 489 operates weekdays only in the peak direction, line 487 and the Silver Line operate seven days a week. Hours vary for each line. On August 2012, Metro added one additional late night trip for the Metro Silver Line each direction on Fridays and Saturdays. The trip was added as a result of Metro's successful late night service on the rail lines: [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Red Line]], [[Purple Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Purple Line]], [[Green Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Green Line]], [[Gold Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Gold Line]], [[Blue Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Blue Line]], [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Expo Line]] and Metro's other transitway line: [[Orange Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Orange Line]].\n\nThe fare structure differs between Metro Silver Line, Metro Express, Foothill Transit's Silver Streak, Foothill Transit Line 481, and Foothill Transit's Commuter Express. Fares vary based on the destination. Metro Silver Line charges $2.45 on the busway regardless of the trip length. For Metro Express Lines: 485, 487 & 489 the base fare of $1.75 is applied for passengers not traveling east of Cal State L.A. Station. Before the Metro Silver Line was implemented, former Metro Express Lines: 483, 484, and 490 charged $1.25 for the base fare for passengers not traveling east of the Cal State LA Station. Since the opening of the Metro Silver Line, Metro has been working with Foothill Transit to have each agency's pass accepted on the Metro Silver Line and Foothill Transit's Silver Streak. On October 2012, an agreement was reached with Foothill Transit to lower the Silver Streak's base fare from $2.50 to $2.45 and accept Metro's passes. Metro would begin accepting Foothill Transit's passes for the Metro Silver Line. As a result of the Foothill Transit-Metro \"Silver2Silver\" program, the Silver Streak also charges a $2.45 fare for all trips. The fare for Line 481 is $2.75, regardless of trip length. Commuter Express fares are $4.90. Metro and Foothill Transit's \"Silver2Silver\" program is only applied between the El Monte Station and Downtown Los Angeles. This is the only segment where both the Metro Silver Line and Foothill's Silver Streak run together. To make up Foothill Transit's loss of lowering the Silver Streak fare, Metro will pay Foothill Transit from subsidies coming from the Metro Express Lanes project. The year-long promotion will run through October 2013. During the time in between Metro and Foothill Transit will determine if the program is successful. If the program is deemed successful, the agreement will become permanent. This may cause Metro to consider doing a fare agreement on the Harbor busway with [[Torrance Transit]], and [[Gardena Transit]].\n\nThe El Monte Bus Station is claimed to be the busiest bus terminal west of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], with 22,000 boardings daily.<ref name=biggest>{{cite web|url=http://thesource.metro.net/2010/04/13/el-monte-bus-station-work-begins-next-week/|title=El Monte bus station work begins next week|work=The Source}}</ref>\n\n==Entrances and exits==\nThe carpool lanes of the El Monte Busway can only be entered and exited at a few points. The segment from El Monte to [[Long Beach Freeway|I-710]] is demarcated not only with two 'double yellow' lines which are typical of Southern California HOV lanes, but also an approximately {{Convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} asphalt median. The segment west of I-710 into Downtown Los Angeles is on an alignment separate from the regular lanes of the [[San Bernardino Freeway|I-10]] As part of the ExpressLanes project, this buffer zone was restriped into a travel lane.\n\nWestbound entrances are at I-605, Baldwin Ave. in El Monte, El Monte Bus Station (for buses only), Del Mar Ave. (where motorists take a ramp from street level), and I-710 (for buses only). Westbound exits are at Baldwin Ave., Fremont Ave., I-710, I-5, Vignes St., and Alameda St. Eastbound entrances are at Alameda St., Patsaouras Transit Plaza at Union Station, I-710, and Baldwin Ave. Eastbound exits are at Patsaouras Transit Plaza, I-710 (for buses only), Del Mar Ave. (where motorists take a ramp to street level), Baldwin Ave., and I-605.\n\n==List of stations, from west to east==\nThe El Monte Busway has three stations and one street stop which is located near Union Station.

A few years later he employs jugglers to perform acts along with the horse and [[clown]] acts. From then until the modern day, jugglers have found work and have commonly been associated with circuses.<br>\n\n'''1793 &ndash; [[North America]]'''<br>\n[[John Bill Ricketts]] presents America's first circus. In the opening show, watched by [[George Washington]], Ricketts juggled on horseback.\n\n'''1821 &ndash; England'''<br>\n[[William Hazlitt]] writes the essay \"The Indian Juggler\" describing a four ball juggling routine in detail, probably performed by [[Ramo Samee]], considered to be the first modern professional juggler. In his day Ramo Samee was a well-known [[United Kingdom|British]] celebrity.\n\n'''Mid-Late19th century &ndash; Europe and North America''' <br>\n[[Variety show|Variety]] and [[music hall]] theatres become more popular, and jugglers are in demand to fill time between music acts, performing in front of the curtain while sets are changed. \n* Performers start specializing in juggling, separating it from other kinds of performance such as sword swallowing and [[Magic (illusion)|magic]].\n* The Gentleman Juggler style is established by German jugglers such as ''Salerno'' and ''Kara''.\n* [[Rubber]] processing is developed and jugglers start using rubber balls. Previously juggling balls were made from balls of twine, stuffed leather bags, wooden spheres or various metals. Solid rubber balls meant that bounce juggling was possible. Inflated rubber balls lead to ball spinning.\n\n'''1883 &ndash; North America'''<br>\nIn [[Boston]] a new style of variety show is born. The format is a continuous show, the same 8-10 acts repeated over and over, the audience coming and going when they had seen all the acts. This was later known as [[Vaudeville]].\n\n'''1885 &ndash; England''' <br>\n[[Paul Cinquevalli]] (1859 &ndash; 1918) made his debut at a circus in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]]. Cinquevalli was the first juggling super-star, and was referred to by the British press as the world's greatest juggler.\n\n'''Late 19th century &ndash; Early 20th century &ndash; North America'''<br>\nIn the USA the popularity of variety shows and vaudeville shows created great demand for professional jugglers. To distinguish them from other entertainers, jugglers were constantly developing new tricks, props, styles and characters, many of which survive to this day.\n\nHere are some juggling \"firsts\" from America, based on anecdotal evidence.\n* Jim Harrigan was the first tramp juggler, using cigar boxes and balls. He was also one of the first talking comedy jugglers, putting jokes into his routine.\n* DeWitt Cook was the first to perform with \"[[juggling club]]s\". Previously jugglers had only used sticks, torches or knives. Instead Cook juggled 3 Indian Clubs, normally used for arm-swinging exercises. Indian Clubs were made from wood, were very heavy and were shaped like a modern bowling pin. This design is still recognizable in today's specially manufactured, light, plastic juggling clubs.\n* Charles Hoey was the first to juggle 4 clubs, though he could not stop juggling without dropping. When performing on stage the curtain had to be closed while he was still juggling so the audience wouldn't see him drop.\n* Ben Mowatt was the first to juggle 5 clubs.\n* Pat McBann was the first to juggle six clubs. He did 4 in one hand and 2 in the other, but died before he had it ready to perform in public.\n* John Breen juggled 7 clubs for 35 right-handed throws. Breen also managed other very technical tricks such as a 5 club shower, as well as 5 club cascade with a head balance. He performed 6 clubs on stage. He died aged only 21 in 1912.\n* The first record of two-person club passing is in 1885 by the juggling team \u201cThe Murdock Bros\u201d. They passed four clubs side-by-side them while standing on pedestals.\n* The Devine Bros perform 6 club passing, facing each other, for the first time.\n* The Three Mowatts were the first three-person club passing act, first performing in 1895. John Whitfield left the Mowatts to set up his own troupe called the Juggling Johnsons and created the first 4 and 5 person juggling.\n* Jack Greene and Joe Piche were the first to pass 8 clubs.\n\n'''1896 &ndash; Siberia'''<br>\n[[Enrico Rastelli]] is born. Rastelli (1896\u20131931) is considered to be one of the greatest jugglers who ever lived. He is recorded as juggling 10 balls (though never 9), 8 sticks (small clubs) and 8 plates. He was also one of the first jugglers to use footballs (soccer balls) and other large rubber balls.\n\n'''1912 &ndash; North America'''<br>\nGlow-props are invented. Adolf Behrend, the German Gentleman juggler ''Salerno'' builds a set of clubs with electric lights inside which changed colors as he juggles them.\n\n'''1930-1950 &ndash; Europe and North America'''<br>\nVariety and Vaudeville shows start to decline in popularity due to competition from [[motion picture]] theatres, [[radio]] and [[television]].\n\n'''1947 &ndash; North America'''<br>\nThe [[International Jugglers' Association]] is formed.<br>\n\n'''1984''' - [https://www.oddballs.co.uk/ Oddballs] now the World's oldest Juggling Shop opens in London\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of cardistry]]\n* [[Yo-yo#History|History of yo-yo]]\n* [[Hacky Sack#History|History of hacky sack]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal|last=Breen|first=Tom|title=Juggling Firsts|journal=The Juggler's Bulletin|date=May 1946|volume=20|url=http://www.juggling.org/jb/jb20.html}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120217090129/https://www2.bc.edu/~lewbel/jugweb/history-1.html Research in Juggling History] by [[Arthur Lewbel]] (November 1995, revised March 2002)\n*{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Andrew|title=Juggling : the Art and its Artists|year=1985|publisher=Werner Rausch and Werner L\u00fcft|location=Berlin|isbn=3-9801140-1-5|url=http://www.juggling.org/books/artists/|author2=Karl-Heinz Ziethen and Toly}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.juggling.org/animations/classic.html Short videos \"Great Jugglers of the Past\" with performers Enrico Rastelli, Bobby May, and Francis Brunn]\n\n{{Juggling}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Juggling}}\n[[Category:Juggling]]\n[[Category:History of games]]\n", "text_old": "The art of [[juggling]] has existed in various cultures throughout history.

A few years later he employs jugglers to perform acts along with the horse and [[clown]] acts. From then until the modern day, jugglers have found work and have commonly been associated with circuses.<br>\n\n'''1793 &ndash; [[North America]]'''<br>\n[[John Bill Ricketts]] presents America's first circus. In the opening show, watched by [[George Washington]], Ricketts juggled on horseback.\n\n'''1821 &ndash; England'''<br>\n[[William Hazlitt]] writes the essay \"The Indian Juggler\" describing a four ball juggling routine in detail, probably performed by [[Ramo Samee]], considered to be the first modern professional juggler. In his day Ramo Samee was a well-known [[United Kingdom|British]] celebrity.\n\n'''Mid-Late19th century &ndash; Europe and North America''' <br>\n[[Variety show|Variety]] and [[music hall]] theatres become more popular, and jugglers are in demand to fill time between music acts, performing in front of the curtain while sets are changed. \n* Performers start specializing in juggling, separating it from other kinds of performance such as sword swallowing and [[Magic (illusion)|magic]].\n* The Gentleman Juggler style is established by German jugglers such as ''Salerno'' and ''Kara''.\n* [[Rubber]] processing is developed and jugglers start using rubber balls. Previously juggling balls were made from balls of twine, stuffed leather bags, wooden spheres or various metals. Solid rubber balls meant that bounce juggling was possible. Inflated rubber balls lead to ball spinning.\n\n'''1883 &ndash; North America'''<br>\nIn [[Boston]] a new style of variety show is born. The format is a continuous show, the same 8-10 acts repeated over and over, the audience coming and going when they had seen all the acts. This was later known as [[Vaudeville]].\n\n'''1885 &ndash; England''' <br>\n[[Paul Cinquevalli]] (1859 &ndash; 1918) made his debut at a circus in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]].

To distinguish them from other entertainers, jugglers were constantly developing new tricks, props, styles and characters, many of which survive to this day.\n\nHere are some juggling \"firsts\" from America, based on anecdotal evidence.\n* Jim Harrigan was the first tramp juggler, using cigar boxes and balls. He was also one of the first talking comedy jugglers, putting jokes into his routine.\n* DeWitt Cook was the first to perform with \"[[juggling club]]s\". Previously jugglers had only used sticks, torches or knives. Instead Cook juggled 3 Indian Clubs, normally used for arm-swinging exercises. Indian Clubs were made from wood, were very heavy and were shaped like a modern bowling pin. This design is still recognizable in today\u2019s specially manufactured, light, plastic juggling clubs.\n* Charles Hoey was the first to juggle 4 clubs, though he could not stop juggling without dropping. When performing on stage the curtain had to be closed while he was still juggling so the audience wouldn\u2019t see him drop.\n* Ben Mowatt was the first to juggle 5 clubs.\n* Pat McBann was the first to juggle six clubs. He did 4 in one hand and 2 in the other, but died before he had it ready to perform in public.\n* John Breen juggled 7 clubs for 35 right-handed throws. Breen also managed other very technical tricks such as a 5 club shower, as well as 5 club cascade with a head balance. He performed 6 clubs on stage. He died aged only 21 in 1912.\n* The first record of two-person club passing is in 1885 by the juggling team \u201cThe Murdock Bros\u201d. They passed four clubs side-by-side them while standing on pedestals.\n* The Devine Bros perform 6 club passing, facing each other, for the first time.\n* The Three Mowatts were the first three-person club passing act, first performing in 1895. John Whitfield left the Mowatts to set up his own troupe called the Juggling Johnsons and created the first 4 and 5 person juggling.\n* Jack Greene and Joe Piche were the first to pass 8 clubs.\n\n'''1896 &ndash; Siberia'''<br>\n[[Enrico Rastelli]] is born. Rastelli (1896\u20131931) is considered to be one of the greatest jugglers who ever lived. He is recorded as juggling 10 balls (though never 9), 8 sticks (small clubs) and 8 plates. He was also one of the first jugglers to use footballs (soccer balls) and other large rubber balls.\n\n'''1912 &ndash; North America'''<br>\nGlow-props are invented.

The East African Highlands physiographic division consists of the [[East African Rift]] and [[Ethiopian Highlands|Abyssinian]] physiographic provinces, part of the long chain of mountains that runs down [[East Africa]]. The mountains and mountain ranges that make up the East African Highlands share many common plant and animal species and communities, known as [[Afromontane]] flora and fauna.\n\n==Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic==\nThe Highlands are home to the '''Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic''' [[ecoregion]]. The ecoregion includes the portion of the Higlands above 1000 meters elevation, including the Inyangani Highlands, Vumba Highlands, Chimanimani Mountains, Chipinge Uplands, and the isolated [[Mount Gorongosa]] further east in Mozambique. The [[Southern Miombo woodlands]] ecoregion lies at lower elevations east and west of the highlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nThe highlands have a cooler, moister climate than the surrounding lowlands, which support distinct communities of plants and animals. The ecoregion is home to several plant communities: submontane and montane grasslands, moist evergreen forest, dry montane forest, miombo woodlands, and [[heathland]]s.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\n==Flora==\nMuch of the small area consists of rolling hills covered with grassland, which are renewed annually following the fires that occur at the end of the dry season. At lower elevations, ''[[Themeda triandra]]'' is the predominant grass on the more fertile red soils, and ''[[Loudetia simplex]]'' is common on less-fertile white sandy soils. At higher elevations are montane grasslands made up mostly of short, tufted grasses, including ''[[Loudetia simplex]], [[Trachypogon spicatus]], [[Exotheca abyssinica]],'' and ''[[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]]''.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nSome valleys and east-facing slopes contain areas of tropical rainforest, with a high canopy, [[liana]]s, and a rich undergrowth. There are larger areas of dry forest at higher altitudes in places where the ground is well watered and on drier slopes patches of [[miombo]] woodland ''([[Brachystegia spiciformis]]'', ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' and ''[[Uapaca kirkiana]]'') and areas of heathland at higher elevations. There are patches of the tall evergreen Mobola Plum ''[[Parinari curatellifolia]]'' near the town of [[Chipinge]] and on the western slopes of the Nyanga Highlands.\n\nIn the Chimanimani Mountains and [[Mount Gorongosa]], heathlands are found on poor, acidic sandy soils derived from [[quartzite]]. The heathlands are of two types, [[Ericaceae|ericaceous]] and [[proteaceous]]. The ericaceous heathlands are dominated by ''Philippia pallidiflora, P. hexandra, Phylica ericoides, Passerina montana, Erica eylesii, E. pleiotricha, E. gazensis,'' and ''E. johnstoniana. Protea gazensis, P. welwitschii'', and ''[[Leucospermum saxosum]]'' are common in the proteaceous heathlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nA number of indigenous monocot lilies with small distribution ranges occur in the highlands. ''Cryptostephanotis vansonii'', ''Cyrtanthus rhodesianus'', and ''Scadoxus pole-evansi'' are popular with rare plant collectors.\n\n==Fauna==\nThis variety of different types of habitat results in a richness of animal life too. Animals found in the Highlands include [[blue monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus mitis)'' the Samango [[Sykes' monkey]], [[East African little collared fruit bat]] ''(Myonycteris relicta)'' and [[Marshall's pygmy chameleon]] ''([[Rhampholeon]] marshalli)''.

The Eastern Highlands extend for about {{convert|300|km|mi}} along Zimbabwe's eastern border with [[Mozambique]].<ref name=\"EnZim\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Zimbabwe|publisher=Arlington Business Corporation|location=Worcester|date=1989|edition=2nd|isbn=0-9514505-0-6}}</ref>\n\nThe range comprises three main mountain groups - [[Nyanga, Zimbabwe|Nyanga]] (to the north) which contains Zimbabwe's highest mountain [[Mount Nyangani]], [[Africa]]'s second-longest waterfall [[Mutarazi Falls]] and the [[Honde Valley]] which leads into Mozambique; [[Bvumba]] Mountains (centrally situated near the city of [[Mutare]]); and [[Chimanimani]] (to the south). These regions are all sparsely populated, highland country and are covered in rich grassland and forests.<ref name=\"EnZim\" />\n\nThe Highlands have a more equable climate than Zimbabwe's central plateau, with higher rainfall, low cloud and heavy mists and dew as moisture moves inland from the [[Indian Ocean]]. Many streams and rivers originate in these mountains, which form the watershed between the [[Zambezi]] and [[Save River (Africa)|Save River]] systems.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\">\"Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic\". World Wildlife Fund. Accessed 17 June 2018 [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1006]</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Highlands are is part of the '''East African Highlands''', one of four distinct physiographic divisions on the African continent. The East African Highlands physiographic division consists of the [[East African Rift]] and [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]n physiographic provinces, so are part of the long chain of mountains that runs down [[East Africa]]. The mountains and mountain ranges that make up the East African Highlands share many common plant and animal species and communities, known as [[Afromontane]] flora and fauna.\n\n==Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic==\nThe Highlands are home to the '''Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic''' [[ecoregion]]. The ecoregion includes the portion of the Higlands above 1000 meters elevation, including the Inyangani Highlands, Vumba Highlands, Chimanimani Mountains, Chipinge Uplands, and the isolated [[Mount Gorongosa]] further east in Mozambique. The [[Southern Miombo woodlands]] ecoregion lies at lower elevations east and west of the highlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nThe highlands have a cooler, moister climate than the surrounding lowlands, which support distinct communities of plants and animals. The ecoregion is home to several plant communities: submontane and montane grasslands, moist evergreen forest, dry montane forest, miombo woodlands, and [[heathland]]s.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\n==Flora==\nMuch of the small area consists of rolling hills covered with grassland, which are renewed annually following the fires that occur at the end of the dry season. At lower elevations, ''[[Themeda triandra]]'' is the predominant grass on the more fertile red soils, and ''[[Loudetia simplex]]'' is common on less-fertile white sandy soils. At higher elevations are montane grasslands made up mostly of short, tufted grasses, including ''[[Loudetia simplex]], [[Trachypogon spicatus]], [[Exotheca abyssinica]],'' and ''[[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]]''.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nSome valleys and east-facing slopes contain areas of tropical rainforest, with a high canopy, [[liana]]s, and a rich undergrowth. There are larger areas of dry forest at higher altitudes in places where the ground is well watered and on drier slopes patches of [[miombo]] woodland ''([[Brachystegia spiciformis]]'', ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' and ''[[Uapaca kirkiana]]'') and areas of heathland at higher elevations. There are patches of the tall evergreen Mobola Plum ''[[Parinari curatellifolia]]'' near the town of [[Chipinge]] and on the western slopes of the Nyanga Highlands.\n\nIn the Chimanimani Mountains and [[Mount Gorongosa]], heathlands are found on poor, acidic sandy soils derived from [[quartzite]]. The heathlands are of two types, [[Ericaceae|ericaceous]] and [[proteaceous]]. The ericaceous heathlands are dominated by ''Philippia pallidiflora, P. hexandra, Phylica ericoides, Passerina montana, Erica eylesii, E. pleiotricha, E. gazensis,'' and ''E. johnstoniana. Protea gazensis, P. welwitschii'', and ''[[Leucospermum saxosum]]'' are common in the proteaceous heathlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nA number of indigenous monocot lilies with small distribution ranges occur in the highlands. ''Cryptostephanotis vansonii'', ''Cyrtanthus rhodesianus'', and ''Scadoxus pole-evansi'' are popular with rare plant collectors.\n\n==Fauna==\nThis variety of different types of habitat results in a richness of animal life too. Animals found in the Highlands include [[blue monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus mitis)'' the Samango [[Sykes' monkey]], [[East African little collared fruit bat]] ''(Myonycteris relicta)'' and [[Marshall's pygmy chameleon]] ''([[Rhampholeon]] marshalli)''.

The United Nations and the [[Government of South Sudan|South Sudanese government]] are repairing the roads, but full repair is expected to take many years. In 2003, the [[Swiss Foundation for Mine Action]] (FSD) started to clear the roads leading from Juba to Uganda and Kenya. It was expected that these roads would be completely de-mined and rebuilt in the course of 2006\u20132008. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The rebuilding of the roads, which are mostly un-paved, takes a tremendous amount of effort and time because of the limited work season due to the lengthy rainy season, which lasts from March until October. The roads are important for the peace process in Sudan as people need them to return to their homes and to regain what they feel is a normal life. The first road that has started to be rebuilt is the road to Uganda. This road is particularly important, as many of the original inhabitants of Juba fled to Uganda during the war. {{As of|2009}}, there are three paved roads in Juba, one that was re-surfaced in July. The main one is a concrete road, built by the British in the 1950s. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nBetween 2008 and 2011, the [[Government of Uganda|Ugandan government]] and the [[Southern Sudan autonomous region (2005\u20132011)|South Sudanese government]] undertook joint efforts to develop a railway link between the [[Northern Region, Uganda|Northern Ugandan]] city of [[Gulu]] and Juba, with an extension to [[Wau, Sudan|Wau]]. A memorandum of understanding between the two governments was signed to that effect in August 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pachodo.org/20080908783/Pachodo.org-English-Articles/gulu-nimule-juba-wau-railway-line-in-offing.html|title=Gulu \u2013 Juba Railway in the Offing|date=20 September 2010|publisher=Pachodo.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007041738/http://www.pachodo.org/20080908783/Pachodo.org-English-Articles/gulu-nimule-juba-wau-railway-line-in-offing.html|archivedate=7 October 2011|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref> The same memorandum outlined plans to develop the road network between the two countries.

Many of these structures are still standing today. Public buildings such as the Ivory Bank, Notos Lounge, the old Sudan Airways Building, Paradise Hotel, and the Nile Commercial Bank and Buffalo Commercial Bank were all built by Greeks.

During the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], Juba was a strategic location that was the focus of much fighting. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nIn 2005, Juba became the interim seat and the capital of the [[Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan]] after the signing of the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] (before the agreement, [[Rumbek]] had been the proposed interim capital). With the advent of peace, the United Nations increased its presence in Juba, shifting its management of operations in [[Southern Sudan]] from its previous location in [[Kenya]]. Under the leadership of the United Nations [[OCHA|Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]], the United Nations established a camp known as \"OCHA Camp\", which served as a base for many United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nJuba became the world's newest national capital on 9 July 2011, when South Sudan formally declared its independence from the [[Republic of the Sudan]]. However, influential parties including the South Sudanese government expressed dissatisfaction with the city's suitability as a national capital, and the government proposed that a new [[planned city]] be built as a replacement capital elsewhere, most likely [[Ramciel]] in [[Lakes (state)|Lakes]].<ref name=\"rnw\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/new-capital-city-south-sudan|title=New capital city for South Sudan?|date=6 February 2011|accessdate=24 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629133501/http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/new-capital-city-south-sudan|archivedate=29 June 2012|agency=Radio Netherlands}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 September 2011, the government announced the capital of South Sudan would move some 250&nbsp;km away from Juba to Ramciel, which is located in the middle of South Sudan about 60&nbsp;km from Yirol West County of Lakes state.

Before the civil war, Juba was also a transport hub, with highways connecting it to [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].\n\nAfter the war, Juba has no longer been a significant trade city. Roads and the river harbour are currently not in use due to disrepair. The United Nations and the [[Government of South Sudan|South Sudanese government]] are repairing the roads, but full repair is expected to take many years. In 2003, the [[Swiss Foundation for Mine Action]] (FSD) started to clear the roads leading from Juba to Uganda and Kenya. It was expected that these roads would be completely de-mined and rebuilt in the course of 2006\u20132008. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The rebuilding of the roads, which are mostly un-paved, takes a tremendous amount of effort and time because of the limited work season due to the lengthy rainy season, which lasts from March until October. The roads are important for the peace process in Sudan as people need them to return to their homes and to regain what they feel is a normal life. The first road that has started to be rebuilt is the road to Uganda. This road is particularly important, as many of the original inhabitants of Juba fled to Uganda during the war. {{As of|2009}}, there are three paved roads in Juba, one that was re-surfaced in July. The main one is a concrete road, built by the British in the 1950s. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nBetween 2008 and 2011, the [[Government of Uganda|Ugandan government]] and the [[Southern Sudan autonomous region (2005\u20132011)|South Sudanese government]] undertook joint efforts to develop a railway link between the [[Northern Region, Uganda|Northern Ugandan]] city of [[Gulu]] and Juba, with an extension to [[Wau, Sudan|Wau]].
