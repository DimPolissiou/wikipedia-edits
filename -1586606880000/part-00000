Then, for the patient to exhale, the air inside the cylinder is compressed slightly (or allowed to equalize to ambient room pressure), causing the patient's chest and abdomen to partially collapse, forcing air out of the lungs, as the patient exhales the breath through their exposed mouth and nose, outside the cylinder).<ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" /><ref name=\"how_does_iron_lung_work_2018_08_21_newsweek\" />\n\nExamples of the device include the Drinker respirator, the Emerson respirator, and the Both (or Emerson\u2013Drinker) respirator.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing.

Histamine is a [[monoamine neurotransmitter]].\n\n== Synthesis and metabolism ==\nHistamine is derived from the [[decarboxylation]] of the [[amino acid]] [[histidine]], a reaction [[catalyst|catalyzed]] by the [[enzyme]] [[L-histidine decarboxylase]]. It is a [[hydrophilic]] [[vasoactive]] [[amine]].\n\n[[Image:Histidine decarboxylase.svg|thumb|center|433px|Conversion of [[histidine]] to histamine by [[histidine decarboxylase]]]]\n\nOnce formed, histamine is either stored or rapidly inactivated by its primary [[degradative enzyme]]s, [[histamine-N-methyltransferase]] or [[diamine oxidase]]. In the central nervous system, histamine released into the [[synapse]]s is primarily broken down by [[histamine-N-methyltransferase]], while in other tissues both enzymes may play a role. Several other enzymes, including [[MAO-B]] and [[ALDH2]], further process the immediate metabolites of histamine for excretion or recycling.\n\nBacteria also are capable of producing histamine using histidine decarboxylase enzymes unrelated to those found in animals.  A non-infectious form of foodborne disease, [[scombroid poisoning]], is due to histamine production by bacteria in spoiled food, particularly fish.  Fermented foods and beverages naturally contain small quantities of histamine due to a similar conversion performed by fermenting bacteria or yeasts.  [[Sake]] contains histamine in the 20\u201340&nbsp;mg/L range; [[wine]]s contain it in the 2\u201310&nbsp;mg/L range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://astrobiology.berkeley.edu/PDFs_articles/WineAnalysisAnalChem.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110719065511/http://astrobiology.berkeley.edu/PDFs_articles/WineAnalysisAnalChem.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref>\n\n== Storage and release ==\n[[Image:SMCpolyhydroxysmall.jpg|thumb|Mast cells.]]\nMost histamine in the body is generated in granules in [[mast cells]] and in white blood cells (leukocytes) called [[basophils]]. Mast cells are especially numerous at sites of potential injury \u2014 the nose, mouth, and feet, internal body surfaces, and blood vessels.  Non-mast cell histamine is found in several tissues, including the [[brain]], where it functions as a neurotransmitter.  Another important site of histamine storage and release is the [[enterochromaffin-like cell|enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell]] of the [[stomach]].\n\nThe most important pathophysiologic mechanism of mast cell and basophil histamine release is [[immune system|immunologic]].  These cells, if sensitized by [[IgE]] [[antibody|antibodies]] attached to their [[cell membrane|membranes]], [[degranulation|degranulate]] when exposed to the appropriate [[antigen]].  Certain [[amine]]s and [[alkaloid]]s, including such drugs as [[morphine]], and [[curare]] alkaloids, can displace histamine in granules and cause its release. [[Antibiotic]]s like [[polymyxin]] are also found to stimulate histamine release.\n\nHistamine release occurs when allergens bind to mast-cell-bound IgE antibodies. Reduction of IgE overproduction may lower the likelihood of allergens finding sufficient free IgE to trigger a mast-cell-release of histamine.\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nIn humans, histamine exerts its effects primarily by binding to [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein-coupled]] [[histamine receptors]], designated H<sub>1</sub> through H<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=\"Histamine receptors\" /> As of 2015, histamine is believed to activate ligand-gated chloride channels in the brain and intestinal epithelium.<ref name=\"Histamine receptors\" /><ref name=\"FGID mast cell\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Biological targets of histamine in the human body\n|-\n! {{nowrap|[[G-protein coupled receptor]]}} !!

The cell bodies of these neurons are located in a portion of the posterior [[hypothalamus]] known as the [[tuberomammillary nucleus]] (TMN). The histamine neurons in this region comprise the [[Neurotransmitter#Histamine|brain's histamine system]], which projects widely throughout the brain and includes [[axonal projection]]s to the [[brain|cortex]], [[medial forebrain bundle]], and elsewhere.

The newer class of [[H1 antagonist#Second-generation|second-generation H<sub>1</sub> antihistamines]] do not readily permeate the blood\u2013brain barrier and thus are less likely to cause sedation, although individual reactions, concomitant medications and dosage may increase the likelihood of a sedating effect. In contrast, [[H3 receptor antagonist|histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist]]s increase wakefulness. Similar to the sedative effect of first-generation H<sub>1</sub> antihistamines, an inability to maintain [[Alertness|vigilance]] can occur from the inhibition of histamine biosynthesis or the loss (i.e., degeneration or destruction) of histamine-releasing neurons in the TMN.\n\n=== Gastric acid release ===\n[[Enterochromaffin-like cell]]s, located within the gastric glands of the stomach, release histamine that stimulates nearby [[parietal cell]]s by binding to the apical H<sub>2</sub> receptor. Stimulation of the parietal cell induces the uptake of carbon dioxide and water from the blood, which is then converted to carbonic acid by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.  Inside the cytoplasm of the parietal cell, the carbonic acid readily dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions.

The different H receptors have been known to have different effects on the treatment of this disease. The H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>4</sub> receptors, in one study, have been shown to be counterproductive in the treatment of MS. The H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>4</sub> receptors are thought to increase permeability in the blood-brain barrier, thus increasing infiltration of unwanted cells in the central nervous system. This can cause inflammation, and MS symptom worsening. The H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>3</sub> receptors are thought to be helpful when treating MS patients. Histamine has been shown to help with T-cell differentiation. This is important because in MS, the body's immune system attacks its own myelin sheaths on nerve cells (which causes loss of signaling function and eventual nerve degeneration). By helping T cells to differentiate, the T cells will be less likely to attack the body's own cells, and instead attack invaders.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jadidi-Niaragh F, Mirshafiey A |title=Histamine and histamine receptors in pathogenesis and treatment of multiple sclerosis |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=180\u20139 |date=September 2010 |pmid=20493888 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2010.05.005 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Disorders ==\nAs an integral part of the immune system, histamine may be involved in [[immune system disorder]]s<ref>{{cite journal|author1=E.

Histamine is a [[monoamine neurotransmitter]].\n\n== Synthesis and metabolism ==\nHistamine is derived from the [[decarboxylation]] of the [[amino acid]] [[histidine]], a reaction [[catalyst|catalyzed]] by the [[enzyme]] [[L-histidine decarboxylase]]. It is a [[hydrophilic]] [[vasoactive]] [[amine]].\n\n[[Image:Histidine decarboxylase.svg|thumb|center|433px|Conversion of [[histidine]] to histamine by [[histidine decarboxylase]]]]\n\nOnce formed, histamine is either stored or rapidly inactivated by its primary [[degradative enzyme]]s, [[histamine-N-methyltransferase]] or [[diamine oxidase]]. In the central nervous system, histamine released into the [[synapse]]s is primarily broken down by [[histamine-N-methyltransferase]], while in other tissues both enzymes may play a role. Several other enzymes, including [[MAO-B]] and [[ALDH2]], further process the immediate metabolites of histamine for excretion or recycling.\n\nBacteria also are capable of producing histamine using histidine decarboxylase enzymes unrelated to those found in animals.  A non-infectious form of foodborne disease, [[scombroid poisoning]], is due to histamine production by bacteria in spoiled food, particularly fish.  Fermented foods and beverages naturally contain small quantities of histamine due to a similar conversion performed by fermenting bacteria or yeasts.  [[Sake]] contains histamine in the 20\u201340&nbsp;mg/L range; [[wine]]s contain it in the 2\u201310&nbsp;mg/L range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://astrobiology.berkeley.edu/PDFs_articles/WineAnalysisAnalChem.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110719065511/http://astrobiology.berkeley.edu/PDFs_articles/WineAnalysisAnalChem.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref>\n\n== Storage and release ==\n[[Image:SMCpolyhydroxysmall.jpg|thumb|Mast cells.]]\nMost histamine in the body is generated in granules in [[mast cells]] and in white blood cells (leukocytes) called [[basophils]]. Mast cells are especially numerous at sites of potential injury \u2014 the nose, mouth, and feet, internal body surfaces, and blood vessels.  Non-mast cell histamine is found in several tissues, including the [[brain]], where it functions as a neurotransmitter.  Another important site of histamine storage and release is the [[enterochromaffin-like cell|enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell]] of the [[stomach]].\n\nThe most important pathophysiologic mechanism of mast cell and basophil histamine release is [[immune system|immunologic]].  These cells, if sensitized by [[IgE]] [[antibody|antibodies]] attached to their [[cell membrane|membranes]], [[degranulation|degranulate]] when exposed to the appropriate [[antigen]].  Certain [[amine]]s and [[alkaloid]]s, including such drugs as [[morphine]], and [[curare]] alkaloids, can displace histamine in granules and cause its release. [[Antibiotic]]s like [[polymyxin]] are also found to stimulate histamine release.\n\nHistamine release occurs when allergens bind to mast-cell-bound IgE antibodies. Reduction of IgE overproduction may lower the likelihood of allergens finding sufficient free IgE to trigger a mast-cell-release of histamine.\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nIn humans, histamine exerts its effects primarily by binding to [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein-coupled]] [[histamine receptors]], designated H<sub>1</sub> through H<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=\"Histamine receptors\" /> As of 2015, histamine is believed to activate ligand-gated chloride channels in the brain and intestinal epithelium.<ref name=\"Histamine receptors\" /><ref name=\"FGID mast cell\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Biological targets of histamine in the human body\n|-\n! {{nowrap|[[G-protein coupled receptor]]}} !!

This allows it to interact and bind more easily.<ref name=\"Noszal, B. pp 15-28\">{{cite book |author1=Noszal, B. |author2=Kraszni, M. |author3=Racz, A. |chapter=Histamine: fundamentals of biological chemistry |editor1=Falus, A. |editor2=Grosman, N. |editor3=Darvas, Z. |title=Histamine: Biology and Medical Aspects |publisher=SpringMed |location=Budapest |year=2004 |isbn=380557715X |pages=15\u201328 }}</ref>\n\n=== Vasodilation and fall in blood pressure ===\nIt has been known for more than one hundred years that an intravenous injection of histamine causes a fall in the blood pressure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dale|first1=HH|last2=Laidlaw|first2=PP|title=The physiological action of beta-iminazolylethylamine.|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=31 December 1910|volume=41|issue=5|pages=318\u201344|pmid=16993030|pmc=1512903|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1910.sp001406}}</ref> The underlying mechanism concerns both vascular hyperpermeability and vasodilation. Histamine binding to endothelial cells causes them to contract, thus increasing vascular leak.

The cell bodies of these neurons are located in a portion of the posterior [[hypothalamus]] known as the [[tuberomammillary nucleus]] (TMN). The histamine neurons in this region comprise the [[Neurotransmitter#Histamine|brain's histamine system]], which projects widely throughout the brain and includes [[axonal projection]]s to the [[brain|cortex]], [[medial forebrain bundle]], and elsewhere. The histamine neurons in the TMN are involved in regulating the [[sleep-wake cycle]] and promote arousal when activated.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = RE | last2 = Stevens | first2 = DR | last3 = Haas | first3 = HL| title = The Physiology of Brain Histamine | journal = Progress in Neurobiology| volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 637\u2013672 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11164999 | doi=10.1016/s0301-0082(00)00039-3}}</ref> The [[neural firing rate]] of histamine neurons in the TMN is strongly [[positively correlated]] with an individual's state of arousal. These neurons fire rapidly during periods of wakefulness, fire more slowly during periods of relaxation/tiredness, and stop firing altogether during [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] and [[NREM]] (non-REM) sleep{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}.\n\nFirst-generation [[H1 antagonist|H<sub>1</sub> antihistamines]] (i.e., [[receptor antagonist|antagonists]] of [[HRH1|histamine receptor H<sub>1</sub>]]) are capable of crossing the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]] and produce [[drowsiness]] by antagonizing histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors in the tuberomammillary nucleus. The newer class of [[H1 antagonist#Second-generation|second-generation H<sub>1</sub> antihistamines]] do not readily permeate the blood\u2013brain barrier and thus are less likely to cause sedation, although individual reactions, concomitant medications and dosage may increase the likelihood of a sedating effect. In contrast, [[H3 receptor antagonist|histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist]]s increase wakefulness. Similar to the sedative effect of first-generation H<sub>1</sub> antihistamines, an inability to maintain [[Alertness|vigilance]] can occur from the inhibition of histamine biosynthesis or the loss (i.e., degeneration or destruction) of histamine-releasing neurons in the TMN.\n\n=== Gastric acid release ===\n[[Enterochromaffin-like cell]]s, located within the gastric glands of the stomach, release histamine that stimulates nearby [[parietal cell]]s by binding to the apical H<sub>2</sub> receptor. Stimulation of the parietal cell induces the uptake of carbon dioxide and water from the blood, which is then converted to carbonic acid by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.  Inside the cytoplasm of the parietal cell, the carbonic acid readily dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions. The bicarbonate ions diffuse back through the basilar membrane and into the bloodstream, while the hydrogen ions are pumped into the lumen of the stomach via a [[P-type ATPase|K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump]]. Histamine release is halted when the pH of the stomach starts to decrease. [[Receptor antagonist|Antagonist]] molecules, like [[ranitidine]], block the H<sub>2</sub> receptor and prevent histamine from binding, causing decreased hydrogen ion secretion.\n\n=== Protective effects ===\nWhile histamine has stimulatory effects upon neurons, it also has  suppressive ones that protect against the  susceptibility to [[convulsion]], drug sensitization, [[denervation supersensitivity]], ischemic lesions and stress.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yanai | first1 = K | last2 = Tashiro | first2 = M | title = The physiological and pathophysiological roles of neuronal histamine: an insight from human positron emission tomography studies. | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 113 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201315 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16890992 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2006.06.008 }}</ref> It has also been suggested that histamine controls the mechanisms by which memories and learning are forgotten.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alvarez | first1 = EO | title = The role of histamine on cognition. | journal = Behavioural Brain Research | volume = 199 | issue = 2 | pages = 183\u20139 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19126417 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbr.2008.12.010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Erection and sexual function ===\nLibido loss and erectile failure can occur during treatment with histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists such as [[cimetidine]],  [[ranitidine]], and [[risperidone]].<ref name=\"White\">{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = JM | last2 = Rumbold | first2 = GR | title = Behavioural effects of histamine and its antagonists: a review. | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201314 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3133686 | doi=10.1007/bf00212757}}</ref> The injection of histamine into the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]] in men with psychogenic impotence produces full or partial erections in 74% of them.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Car\u00e1 | first1 = AM | last2 = Lopes-Martins | first2 = RA | last3 = Antunes | first3 = E | last4 = Nahoum | first4 = CR | last5 = De Nucci | first5 = G | title = The role of histamine in human penile erection. | journal = British Journal of Urology | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 220\u20134 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7850330 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.1995.tb07315.x }}</ref> It has been suggested that H<sub>2</sub> antagonists may cause sexual difficulties by reducing the functional binding of testosterone to its endogenous receptors.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\n=== Schizophrenia ===\nMetabolites of histamine are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of people with [[schizophrenia]], while the efficiency of H<sub>1</sub> receptor binding sites is decreased.

The different H receptors have been known to have different effects on the treatment of this disease. The H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>4</sub> receptors, in one study, have been shown to be counterproductive in the treatment of MS. The H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>4</sub> receptors are thought to increase permeability in the blood-brain barrier, thus increasing infiltration of unwanted cells in the central nervous system. This can cause inflammation, and MS symptom worsening. The H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>3</sub> receptors are thought to be helpful when treating MS patients. Histamine has been shown to help with T-cell differentiation. This is important because in MS, the body's immune system attacks its own myelin sheaths on nerve cells (which causes loss of signaling function and eventual nerve degeneration). By helping T cells to differentiate, the T cells will be less likely to attack the body's own cells, and instead attack invaders.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jadidi-Niaragh F, Mirshafiey A |title=Histamine and histamine receptors in pathogenesis and treatment of multiple sclerosis |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=180\u20139 |date=September 2010 |pmid=20493888 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2010.05.005 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Disorders ==\nAs an integral part of the immune system, histamine may be involved in [[immune system disorder]]s<ref>{{cite journal|author1=E.

{"title_page": "History of the Penrith Panthers", "text_new": "The '''history of the [[Penrith Panthers]]''' stretches back to the 1960s when a team from [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]] entering Sydney's elite competition was first mooted. After admission to the [[NSWRFL premiership]] in 1967, the club struggled on-field until reaching the finals for the first time in the 1980s, and reaching the grand final in the 1990s. The Panthers were a part of 1997's [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] competition before continuing in the re-unified [[NRL]] competition. To date they have won two premierships: [[1991 NSWRL season|1991]] and [[2003 NRL season|2003]].\n\n== 1960s ==\nVarious Penrith [[rugby league]] teams had played for many years between 1912 and 1966 in the Western Districts League under the control of the [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs RLFC]], in the Parramatta competition after Parramatta was admitted to the NSWRL in 1947, and also in a second-tier Sydney competition introduced by the [[NSWRFL]] in 1962. By this time a single top level rugby league team had emerged in the Penrith area and in 1964 they became known as the Penrith Panthers. The Panther had been chosen as the Penrith emblem after a public competition won by a graphic artist from [[Emu Plains]] named Deidre Copeland.\n\nIn 1966 word was out that the New South Wales Rugby Football League would introduce two new teams to the Sydney premiership for the 1967 season. There were three teams vying for the two proposed slots, Penrith, [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla-Sutherland]], and the [[Wentworthville Magpies]]. Cronulla-Sutherland had been assured of one place, leaving Penrith and Wentworthville to fight it out for the other place. The NSWRL eventually settled on Penrith due to their location and a win in the 1966 Second Division title. The team played its first pre-season trial against Cronulla-Sutherland on 24 February. Penrith won 18\u201312 in front of a crowd of 18,768.\n\nThe first premiership team was: [[Bill Tonkin]], [[Bob Landers]], [[David Applebee]], [[Ern Gillon]], [[Wayne Peckham]], [[Maurie Raper]], [[Laurie Fagan]], [[Tony Brown (rugby league)|Tony Brown]] (captain), [[Wal Crust]], [[Bill McCall (rugby league)|Bill McCall]], [[Geoff Waldie]], [[Barry Harris (rugby league)|Barry Harris]] and [[Ron Workman]]. They played their first premiership match was against Canterbury on 2 April and Penrith led 12-10 until the final 15 minutes. Canterbury won 15\u201312.\n\nOn 23 April 1967 [[Penrith Park]] was officially opened with a match between the Panthers and the reigning premiers, St George. The Panthers won 24\u201312 in front of 12,201 spectators.\n\nPenrith finished the season in 11th place, with 12 points from five wins, two draws and 11 losses. In 1968 under new captain coach [[Bob Boland]], the team showed improvement. Penrith surprised everyone by winning the pre-season competition, the Wills Cup, and finished in 8th place. It was hoped they would continue to improve but this hope was short lived. The new club would struggle for almost 20 years before finally reaching their first finals series in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1985|1985]].\n\n== 1970s ==\nIn this period Penrith repeatedly tried to attract the star Australian players they knew they needed. They were consistently unsuccessful in this. This was primarily due to Penrith's poor reputation and it's seemingly remote location, the M4 Freeway was still only a distant dream! Unable to attract local players, in mid 1973 Penrith looked overseas and signed the Great Britain internationals [[Mike Stephenson]] and [[Bill Ashurst]] for the 1974 season. It's important to remember that there was some logic to this. The early 1970s were the last 'Glory Days'  for Great Britain in Rugby league. In mid 1973 Great Britain held the [[Rugby League Ashes]] and were reigning [[Rugby League World Cup]] Champions. The problem was not the players abilities. Stephenson was a tough hooker and could be a very effective playmaker. Ashurst in particular was a brilliant player on his day, he had great acceleration, could chip and chase and was also the first person to use the \"around the corner\" style of goalkicking in Australia, months before [[John Gray (sportsman)|John Gray]] demonstrated this in the 1974 Test series. However Stephenson and Ashurst did not get on personally and this inhibited any development of a strong team.\n\nPenrith had a crop of exciting young stars come through in the 1970s. Players such as [[Kevin Dann]], [[Ross Gigg]], [[Paul Merlo]], [[Tim Sheens]], [[Zac Olearnik]], [[Glenn West]] and [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]] showed great potential and it's interesting to think what could have happened if they had the right sort of on-field leadership and direction.  One of the highlights from the 1970s was beating the 1974 premiers, Eastern Suburbs, to make the final of the 1974 [[Amco Cup]]. However, unused to being favourites they were beaten in the final by Western Division. Their best regular seasons were 1971 \u2013 8th place and 1974 & 76 \u2013 9th place.\n\n== 1980s ==\nThe 1980s was a decade of highs and lows for Penrith. 1980\u201383 saw Penrith finish at, or near, the bottom of the table. In 1984 [[Tim Sheens]] took over as coach and they had their best season ever, finishing 6th, one point outside the five. Sheens was able to instill in Penrith something they had never possessed before, consistency. At one stage they won a record (for Penrith) 5 straight games. They seemed assured of making history but at the most critical time of the season suffered a drop in form, winning only 1 of their last 4 games. This was the year that saw the debut of [[Greg Alexander]].\n\nThey went one better in 1985, when they defeated Manly 10\u20137 at the SCG in a play off for fifth spot. Their joy was short lived however as they were comprehensively defeated 38-6 by a star-studded Parramatta team the following weekend in the qualifying final. The team finished 8th in 1986 but plummeted to 2nd last in 1987.\n\nThe late 1980s saw the first grade debut of future stars such as [[Mark Geyer]], [[John Cartwright (rugby league)|John Cartwright]], [[Steve Carter (rugby league)|Steve Carter]] and [[Brad Fittler]]. Added to now established veterans such as [[Greg Alexander]], [[Brad Izzard]] and [[Royce Simmons]], a team was starting to develop that finally lived up to the potential of a club with the biggest junior league nursery in the world.\n\nFormer player and now Football Manager, [[Ross Gigg]], made what some have regarded as the best ever signings in Penrith's history prior to the 1988 season.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M1YVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=euQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4636%2C417817 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711075226/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M1YVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=euQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4636,417817 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-11 |title=A reveille for the Chocolate Soldiers |accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref> Established stars [[Peter Kelly (rugby league)|Peter Kelly]] and [[Chris Mortimer]] were signed along with a new coach, the veteran [[Ron Willey]].

This eventually led to the breakup of the strong combination that had look set to dominate for the next few years. Penrith's form had been very good in 1992 up to this point, they had comprehensively beaten eventual premiers Brisbane 24\u201310 in round 4 at Lang Park, one of only two home losses they suffered that year, and were firmly entrenched in the top 3, having won 9 of their 13 games. However, after the accident they would only win 2 out of their next 9 games, finishing 9th (still only 3 points ouf of the top five). Greg and close family friends [[Mark Geyer]] and [[Brad Fittler]] left the club soon after (Fittler left after the 1995 season as Penrith had signed with Super League) as well as coach [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]] left mid-way through the 1994 season, to be replaced by [[Royce Simmons]].\n\nThe Panthers were coached by former player and club captain [[Royce Simmons]] starting with the last six games in 1994 until the end of 2001.\n\nDuring the [[Super League war]] Penrith aligned themselves with the breakaway competition. Playing in Super League's 1997 Telstra Cup, they reached the finals. They continued to compete the following year in the re-united [[National Rugby League]].\n\n== 2000s ==\nPenrith again made the finals in the [[2000 NRL season]]. However, in the year 2001, they came last on the competition ladder. 2001 was [[Royce Simmons]]' last season as coach for the Panthers, and he was replaced by [[John Lang (Australian rugby league)|John Lang]] from Cronulla in 2002, where they finished 12th. Their last game of 2002 showed hope as they proceeded to thrash the [[Northern Eagles]], knocking them out of the final eight.\n\nThis showed the promise that was to come the next year. With the signing of [[Preston Campbell]] and [[Joe Galuvao]], their side fired in 2003. Coming off 3 early season losses, they proceeded to lose only 3 other games for the rest of the competition with the local hero, [[Rhys Wesser]] scoring a new club record 25 tries. Penrith finished as Minor Premiers after convincingly accounting for the [[Parramatta Eels]] in the last round of competition. In the Finals series Penrith beat the [[Brisbane Broncos]] and [[New Zealand Warriors]] to reach the Grand Final against the [[Sydney Roosters]].\n\nPenrith, entering the match as underdogs, defeated the Roosters 18\u20136, with winger [[Luke Rooney]] scored two tries. Hooker [[Luke Priddis]] received the [[Clive Churchill Medal]]. The game is also remembered for a spectacular tackle by Scott Sattler in the 2nd Half Roosters winger Todd Byrne, who was sprinting down the left wing for an almost certain try.\n\nPenrith lost the [[World Club Challenge]] in early 2004, with Bradford defeating them 22\u20134 in sub-zero temperatures.<ref>[http://www.superleague.co.uk/wcc_2004.php?rid=321 Super League Europe \u2013 World Club Challenge 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306132411/http://www.superleague.co.uk/wcc_2004.php?rid=321 |date=2009-03-06 }}</ref>\n\nThey did however rally after that loss and once again qualified for the NRL semi-final series by finishing fourth and defeating St George Illawarra in the first week of the semi-finals before being knocked out by the Bulldogs in a controversial Grand Final qualifier two weeks later.\n\nThe Panthers then just failed to qualify for the Top 8 in 2005 finishing two points out and in 10th spot on percentages before enduring another below-par season in 2006 this time falling well short of the finals finishing the year in 12th position. The 2007 season turned out to be a poor one for the Panthers, they won only eight games, finished last and \"won\" the wooden-spoon for the second time in six years after losing to the New Zealand Warriors in the last round of the regular season competition.\nIn 2008 the Panthers improved four spots on their 2007 performance by finishing in 12th spot out of 16 teams in the NRL competition with 10 wins, one draw and 13 losses.\n\nIn 2009, the Penrith Panthers had a strong season up until the final rounds, but towards the end of the season lost 4 of their last 5 games to just miss out on a top 8 place.\n\n== 2010s ==\nFor the 2010 season a teal jersey was used as the away strip. Panthers signings for this year included [[Adrian Purtell]], [[Nigel Plum]], [[Daine Laurie]], [[David Simmons (rugby league)|Dave Simmons]] and [[Sandor Earl]].\n\nThe Panthers wrapped up second spot on the ladder with a team led by veteran [[Petero Civinoceva]], with players such as [[Lachlan Coote]], [[Michael Gordon (rugby league)|Michael Gordon]], [[Luke Lewis]], [[Michael Jennings (rugby league)|Michael Jennings]] and [[Luke Walsh]] in particular having strong seasons. This was the first time that the Panthers have made the playoffs since 2004.\nTheir season ended with a 34\u201312 loss to Sydney Roosters.\n\nSubsequent seasons were not as successful, with the Panthers missing the finals in [[2011 NRL season|2011]], [[2012 NRL season|2012]] and [[2013 NRL season|2013]]. During this period, the club made significant changes to its management structure, coaching staff and player roster. In 2011, former Panthers captain and premiership winning coach Phil Gould was appointed as General Manager of Rugby League, with responsibility for the entire rugby league operations of the club.<ref>{{cite news |title=Back in black: Gould gets free rein on Panthers return |url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/back-in-black-gould-gets-free-rein-on-panthers-return-20110510-1ehf5.html |accessdate=24 April 2014 |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=11 May 2011 |author=Greg Prichard |author2=Brad Walter}}</ref> Shortly after, first grade coach [[Matthew Elliott (rugby league)|Matt Elliott]] and assistant coach Wayne Collins were sacked, with assistant coach [[Steve Georgallis]] acting as interim coach of the first grade team.

Penrith would then go on to win their next 7 games in a row leaving them just outside the finals places.

After admission to the [[NSWRFL premiership]] in 1967, the club struggled on-field until reaching the finals for the first time in the 1980s, and reaching the grand final in the 1990s. The Panthers were a part of 1997's [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] competition before continuing in the re-unified [[NRL]] competition. To date they have won two premierships: [[1991 NSWRL season|1991]] and [[2003 NRL season|2003]].\n\n== 1960s ==\nVarious Penrith [[rugby league]] teams had played for many years between 1912 and 1966 in the Western Districts League under the control of the [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs RLFC]], in the Parramatta competition after Parramatta was admitted to the NSWRL in 1947, and also in a second-tier Sydney competition introduced by the [[NSWRFL]] in 1962. By this time a single top level rugby league team had emerged in the Penrith area and in 1964 they became known as the Penrith Panthers. The Panther had been chosen as the Penrith emblem after a public competition won by a graphic artist from [[Emu Plains]] named Deidre Copeland.\n\nIn 1966 word was out that the New South Wales Rugby Football League would introduce two new teams to the Sydney premiership for the 1967 season. There were three teams vying for the two proposed slots, Penrith, [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla-Sutherland]], and the [[Wentworthville Magpies]]. Cronulla-Sutherland had been assured of one place, leaving Penrith and Wentworthville to fight it out for the other place. The NSWRL eventually settled on Penrith due to their location and a win in the 1966 Second Division title. The team played its first pre-season trial against Cronulla-Sutherland on 24 February. Penrith won 18\u201312 in front of a crowd of 18,768.\n\nThe first premiership team was: [[Bill Tonkin]], [[Bob Landers]], [[David Applebee]], [[Ern Gillon]], [[Wayne Peckham]], [[Maurie Raper]], [[Laurie Fagan]], [[Tony Brown (rugby league)|Tony Brown]] (captain), [[Wal Crust]], [[Bill McCall (rugby league)|Bill McCall]], [[Geoff Waldie]], [[Barry Harris (rugby league)|Barry Harris]] and [[Ron Workman]]. They played their first premiership match was against Canterbury on 2 April and Penrith led 12-10 until the final 15 minutes. Canterbury won 15\u201312.\n\nOn 23 April 1967 [[Penrith Park]] was officially opened with a match between the Panthers and the reigning premiers, St George. The Panthers won 24\u201312 in front of 12,201 spectators.\n\nPenrith finished the season in 11th place, with 12 points from five wins, two draws and 11 losses. In 1968 under new captain coach [[Bob Boland]], the team showed improvement. Penrith surprised everyone by winning the pre-season competition, the Wills Cup, and finished in 8th place. It was hoped they would continue to improve but this hope was short lived. The new club would struggle for almost 20 years before finally reaching their first finals series in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1985|1985]].\n\n== 1970s ==\nIn this period Penrith repeatedly tried to attract the star Australian players they knew they needed. They were consistently unsuccessful in this. This was primarily due to Penrith's poor reputation and it's seemingly remote location, the M4 Freeway was still only a distant dream! Unable to attract local players, in mid 1973 Penrith looked overseas and signed the Great Britain internationals [[Mike Stephenson]] and [[Bill Ashurst]] for the 1974 season. It's important to remember that there was some logic to this. The early 1970s were the last 'Glory Days'  for Great Britain in Rugby league. In mid 1973 Great Britain held the [[Rugby League Ashes]] and were reigning [[Rugby League World Cup]] Champions. The problem was not the players abilities. Stephenson was a tough hooker and could be a very effective playmaker. Ashurst in particular was a brilliant player on his day, he had great acceleration, could chip and chase and was also the first person to use the \"around the corner\" style of goalkicking in Australia, months before [[John Gray (sportsman)|John Gray]] demonstrated this in the 1974 Test series.

The game is also remembered for a spectacular tackle by Scott Sattler in the 2nd Half Roosters winger Todd Byrne, who was sprinting down the left wing for an almost certain try.\n\nPenrith lost the [[World Club Challenge]] in early 2004, with Bradford defeating them 22\u20134 in sub-zero temperatures.<ref>[http://www.superleague.co.uk/wcc_2004.php?rid=321 Super League Europe \u2013 World Club Challenge 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306132411/http://www.superleague.co.uk/wcc_2004.php?rid=321 |date=2009-03-06 }}</ref>\n\nThey did however rally after that loss and once again qualified for the NRL semi-final series by finishing fourth and defeating St George Illawarra in the first week of the semi-finals before being knocked out by the Bulldogs in a controversial Grand Final qualifier two weeks later.\n\nThe Panthers then just failed to qualify for the Top 8 in 2005 finishing two points out and in 10th spot on percentages before enduring another below-par season in 2006 this time falling well short of the finals finishing the year in 12th position. The 2007 season turned out to be a poor one for the Panthers, they won only eight games, finished last and \"won\" the wooden-spoon for the second time in six years after losing to the New Zealand Warriors in the last round of the regular season competition.\nIn 2008 the Panthers improved four spots on their 2007 performance by finishing in 12th spot out of 16 teams in the NRL competition with 10 wins, one draw and 13 losses.\n\nIn 2009, the Penrith Panthers had a strong season up until the final rounds, but towards the end of the season lost 4 of their last 5 games to just miss out on a top 8 place.\n\n== 2010s ==\nFor the 2010 season a teal jersey was used as the away strip. Panthers signings for this year included [[Adrian Purtell]], [[Nigel Plum]], [[Daine Laurie]], [[David Simmons (rugby league)|Dave Simmons]] and [[Sandor Earl]].\n\nThe Panthers wrapped up second spot on the ladder with a team led by veteran [[Petero Civinoceva]], with players such as [[Lachlan Coote]], [[Michael Gordon (rugby league)|Michael Gordon]], [[Luke Lewis]], [[Michael Jennings (rugby league)|Michael Jennings]] and [[Luke Walsh]] in particular having strong seasons. This was the first time that the Panthers have made the playoffs since 2004.\nTheir season ended with a 34\u201312 loss to Sydney Roosters.\n\nSubsequent seasons were not as successful, with the Panthers missing the finals in [[2011 NRL season|2011]], [[2012 NRL season|2012]] and [[2013 NRL season|2013]]. During this period, the club made significant changes to its management structure, coaching staff and player roster.

Penrith got off to a bad start with the club winning only 2 of their first 10 matches leaving the team bottom of the table.  Penrith would then go on to win their next 7 games in a row leaving them just outside the finals places.  In a must win game against the [[Sydney Roosters]] in round 24, Penrith lost the match 22\u20136 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] which meant that the club would miss out on the finals series for the first time since 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/panthers/panthers-torch-3-million-in-dud-investments-to-go-backwards/news-story/ff94e2be41459c89d9badf0e6134b012/|title=Panthers torch $3 million in dud investments \u2026 to go backwards|website=Fox Sports}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/26/1059084266745.html \"Men in Black are back\"] by [[Phil Gould]] July 27, 2003 ''The Sun-Herald''\n\n{{Penrith Panthers}}\n\n[[Category:Penrith Panthers]]\n[[Category:History of rugby league|Penrith Panthers]]\n[[Category:History of sport in Australia by team|Penrith Panthers]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toPhilip Gould (disambiguation)(link changed toPhil Gould (rugby league); link changed toPhil Gould (rugby league); link changed toPhil Gould (rugby league); link changed toPhil Gould (rugby league); link changed toPhil Gould (rugby league)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Penrith_Panthers"}

The cathedral is the seat of the [[Anglican Archbishop of Sydney]] and [[Metropolitan bishop]] of [[New South Wales]], currently the Most Reverend [[Glenn Davies]], elected August 2013. The dean, appointed in May 2015, is the Very Reverend [[Kanishka Raffel]].\n\nThe St Andrew's has an Evangelical ministry, holding services every day, including a weekly healing service.  There is a cathedral choir of men and boys who sing during term time, as well as a company of bell ringers. The notable pipe organ has been restored and is regularly used for recitals and concerts.\n \nDesigned primarily by [[Edmund Blacket]] on foundations laid by [[James Hume (architect)|James Hume]], the cathedral was built from 1837 to 1868, and was ready for services and consecrated in 1868, making it the oldest cathedral in Australia.\n\nSt Andrew's is one of the city's finest examples of [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. Joan Kerr described the cathedral as \"a perfect example of the colonial desire to reproduce England in Australia in the mid nineteenth century.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Kerr, Joan |title=Our Great Victorian Architect, Edmund Thomas Blacket |year=1983 |publisher=National Trust of Australia |isbn=0-909723-17-6}}</ref>\n\nThe cathedral is located at 1400 [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] in the [[Sydney central business district]], in the [[City of Sydney]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. St Andrew's is owned by Anglican Church Property Trust. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 3 September 2004;<ref name=nswshr-1708/> is listed on the City of Sydney local government [[heritage register]];<ref name=\"SHR2\"/> and is listed on the (now defunct) [[Register of the National Estate]].<ref name=AHD>{{cite AHD|1905|St Andrews Anglican Cathedral and Chapter House|date=21 March 1978|accessdate=1 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early construction 1811-{{circa|1874}}===\n====Macquarie and Greenway====\nA cathedral was planned by [[Governors of New South Wales|Governor]] [[Lachlan Macquarie]] to be an impressive building in the centre of Sydney within a large square which would contain major civic buildings. He foresaw that Sydney would grow into a large city requiring a large cathedral. With the architect [[Francis Greenway]], who had been transported to Sydney for forgery, Macquarie planned a church {{convert|200|ft|m|0|order=flip|adj=on}} square and probably with the seating and galleries facing inward from three sides. The foundation stone was laid with full ceremony on 31 August 1819. Only a few foundations were laid, however, before the plan was abandoned. It was later moved to accommodate development under [[Richard Bourke|Governor Bourke]] to make [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] straight rather than interrupted by a large square. Macquarie's plans were abandoned with the appointment of [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] to the colony and [[St James Church, Sydney|St James']] was constructed in place of the proposed cathedral as a church for Sydney.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nMacquarie's vision has since been realised with the construction of the present cathedral and later [[Sydney Town Hall]].<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n====Broughton and Hume====\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal \n | header_align = center\n | header    =\n | image1    = St Andrews Cathedral Sydney Dean Cowper.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = W.

The plans, prepared by the architect [[James Hume (architect)|James Hume]], were of much more modest proportions and were for a traditional cruciform church in the [[Gothic Architecture|Gothic style]]. The designs, dating from the early phase of Gothic Revival architecture, did not show a great expertise in the handling of the particular architectural vocabulary. Only one notable section was completed, the fa\u00e7ade of the south transept. However, the foundations were laid and some of the walls were constructed up to a height of about {{convert|15|ft|m|0|order=flip}}.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n[[File:St Andrews facade.jpg|thumb|left|The west front demonstrates Blacket's mastery of Gothic design.]]\n\nRevival of interest was partly due to the Church Act of 1836 which provided [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Colonial Government]] subsidies for new church construction. In this case, {{Australian pound|1,000}} and finances for a dean was provided. The cathedral was the most prominent of the eight churches commenced under this scheme and the major church building designed by Hume. It was also the first attempt in the colony to produce accurate details from medieval sources. The [[Conrad Martens]] [[lithograph]] influenced much of the church design that followed. Work on the building again ceased in 1842 due to the combined effects of drought and economic depression in the colony.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n====Edmund T. Blacket====\n{{main|Edmund Blacket}}\nIn 1842 [[Edmund Blacket|Edmund Thomas Blacket]] presented himself to Bishop Broughton with a letter from the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] recommending his talent as an architect and having equal facility in both the [[Classical Architecture|Classical]] and the Gothic style. He was eventually to become known as the [[Christopher Wren|Wren]] of Sydney, having designed two universities, three cathedrals and fifty or more parish churches as well as banks, offices, bridges, mansions and countless shops, cottages and terraced houses. Blacket became the official Colonial Architect from 1849 to 1854.\n\nBlacket was an inventive and stylish [[Gothic Revival]] architect who utilised the forms of English Medieval prototypes reproduced in the books of his architectural library to produce designs which, although archeologically \"correct\", are often highly original. This was just as well, because the task that he inherited from Hume was not an easy one. It took some convincing to get the bishop to accept his deviations from the original design. The problem was how to make an imposing cathedral on foundations which were only the size of a large English parish church. Taking into account what Hume had done and the fact that some of Hume's rather amateurish window tracery was already in place, Blacket designed the cathedral in the style known as [[Perpendicular Gothic]], used extensively at the cathedrals of [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]], [[Winchester Cathedral|Winchester]] and [[York Minster|York]].\n\nBlacket enlarged the building by two bays in length and added the central tower. He also proceeded to change the overall form and detailing of the building. In October 1850 six bishops of Australasia met in Sydney for a conference. Someone suggested that as there were six pillars in the nave of the cathedral each should bear the name of one of the Bishops. William Grant Broughton, Bishop of Sydney and Metropolitan; [[George Augustus Selwyn]], Bishop of New Zealand; [[Francis Russell Nixon]], Bishop of [[Tasmania]]; [[Augustus Short]], Bishop of [[Adelaide]]; [[Charles Perry (bishop)|Charles Perry]], Bishop of [[Melbourne]] and [[William Tyrrell (bishop)|William Tyrell]], Bishop of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]. The pillars were so named. In 1868 the [[Duke of Edinburgh]] attended St Andrew's for an organ recital.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n[[File:St Andrews Sydney 03 interior c.jpg|thumb|Looking east during the restoration of 2000, with scaffolding in front of the east window]]\nWith the repetition of forms and the strongly vertical lines characteristic of [[Perpendicular Gothic]], Blacket succeeded in creating a building which, despite its small size, is nevertheless imposing and of harmonious proportions. The western front with its layered decoration is a majestic composition, based loosely on that of [[York Minster]]. The strongly projecting rectangular buttresses, which transform by stages into lofty octagonally-sectioned pinnacles, and the complex molding around the portals casts varied shadows in the bright Australian sunlight. Kinsela describes it as ''\u201ca grand fa\u00e7ade with superb towers\u2026Covered with a profusion of ornanament, blind traceries and tiny attached pinnacles, in a light-hearted yet elegant manner.\u201d''<ref>{{cite book |author=Kinsela, Joseph |title=St Andrew's Cathedral, a pictorial History and Guide |year=1986 |publisher=Argyle Press |isbn=0-909625-95-6}}</ref>\n\nBishop Broughton did not live to consecrate St Andrew's. He died while on a trip to England in 1853 and is buried in Canterbury Cathedral. The second Bishop of Sydney, [[Frederic Barker|Frederick Barker]], consecrated the completed building on St Andrew's Day, 30 November 1868. Seven out of nine Australian bishops were present at the opening. By 1874 the cathedral was substantially complete, including the western towers. The external form of the building had been finished, the building was furnished and changes had already commenced to the interior. Problems were detected due to water and ventilation which Blacket attended to with varying degrees of success.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n===Development of the cathedral: 1874-1968===\nMinor work was still taking place to the cathedral building from 1874. Fifteen years after opening, large scale cleaning and maintenance of the fabric and furnishings was required, to which Blacket responded.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nWithin 10 years of the 1874 completion the question of size was raised. Attendances at services had grown and on special occasions hundreds were turned away. In 1886 Bishop [[Barry, New South Wales|Barry]] said enlarging the cathedral was a question to face. He suggested the possibility of doubling its size. During 1883 proposals were made for a suitable memorial to Bishop Barker the second Bishop of Sydney. The chapter house was decided on, to be also used as a synod hall. This suggestion was aligned with Barker's advocacy of synodical government. The building was designed by the Blacket Brothers and was opened by Lord Carrington and used for the first time at the general synod in October 1886. In the meantime, [[St Andrew's Cathedral School]] was established in 1885 to provide choristers to sing at daily services, a strong tradition that has continued.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nDuring 1884, J. Pearson was commissioned to prepare designs for the reredos. Work was finally completed in November 1888 following delays with approval of design, carving and erection of the reredos.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nIn 1898 a meeting was held at [[Government House, Sydney|Government House]] and a committee formed to clear off a debt of 7,200 pounds on cathedral property. Further changes to the cathedral proceeded up to 1900. Ongoing problems were encountered with the stonework and water damage. In 1903 the choir stalls were relocated to Blacket's original plan. It seems constant maintenance and deterioration of the building reached a point of frustration for Blacket who provided a detailed explanation of how the building weathered and suggested remedies. A maintenance person was not engaged.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nA number of minor works were undertaken over almost 10 years then in 1916, the next major change took place. The chapter house and new vestries were completed. From 1924 to 1941 works continued when proposals to relocate or enlarge the building were mooted. A series of actual and proposed land resumptions by the Sydney City Council and [[New South Wales Government Railways]] took place in the 1920s and 1930s and discussions took place as to whether the cathedral should be moved to another area of the city. In 1935 the St Andrew's Cathedral Site Act fixed the cathedral site to the land between Kent, George and [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] Streets and the town hall, providing security of tenure. The St Andrew's place subcommittee was formed to recommend treatment of the newly acquired space. In 1937 a competition was launched for proposals to increase the size of the cathedral to seat 2000 to 3000 people. Thirty designs were entered and first place was awarded to R. A. P. Pickney and A. F. E. Gott of London. Much discussion and negotiation took place and some endorsements were made in principal by the St Andrew's building committee. In 1940 the decision was made not to reappoint the building committee and vest its powers in the standing committee. This committee appointed a sub-committee to report on the issue. In the meantime war had broken out and extensions to the cathedral were abandoned as were plans for redevelopment of the site. There was some discussion as to rearranging the interior of the cathedral. The most likely explanation for this change was the geographic changes. When the cathedral was built it was central to its population and had its main entrance in \"a street of churches\". By the 1930s there were fewer living west of Kent Street and the convenient approach for most people was probably the east. In 1941 the cathedral was reoriented. Between 1942 and 1960 emphasis shifted to work on the exterior of the building taking precedence over any other. During World War Two the cathedral was involved with major activities such as the CENEF huts and has had on ongoing social program operating since.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n===Restoration of the cathedral: 1968-present===\nBy 1970 a more comprehensive plan addressing maintenance was required as problems had accelerated. The architects Anchor Murray and Woolley were engaged to prepare a report which was presented to the cathedral chapter in February 1972.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nA synopsis of the report sets the basis for the work that took place over 15 years. The report addressed the structure, fabric, fixed furnishings and interior elements. Ancher Mortlock and Woolley reported again in 1979. All work was carried out in conjunction with the National Trust and the government architect.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nExpenditure on restoration totalled approximately 1.2 million dollars. No further work took place until 1990 when a detailed maintenance study was prepared by Partridge and Davies, architects. This study detailed a long term maintenance program addressing small scale works on a long term basis rather than large scale projects. Work has since been carried out by craftsmen and tradespeople on the basis of funds available. It is hoped a long term stonework program be developed over the next year which is urgently required.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nIn 1999 work to the building reversed the orientation and reinstated the surviving Edmund Blacket fitout and removed all of the 20th-century fitout.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nThe cathedral continues to play a significant role in the community and maintain a role in the ceremonial life of the people of New South Wales, one of the most recent{{when|date=December 2018}} being the state funeral of [[Charles Perkins (Aboriginal activist)|Charles Perkins]], Aboriginal politician and activist and each year several thousand tourists visit. Numerous volunteers offer assistance for activities and administration, including guides who give tours of the cathedral. Increasingly St Andrew's draws its members from the wider metropolitan area. The principal use of the church continues to be for church services - ordinary and special services for the community and organisations and \"occasional\" services - baptisms, weddings and funerals. It is important to note that the cathedral and chapter house hold a collection of furniture, fixtures, artefacts and memorials that reflect the history of the building and the personalities and some items from churches throughout the world.<ref name=nswshr-1708/><ref name=nswshr-1708-1708-4/>\n\nThe Reverend [[Boak Jobbins]] (1947-2012) played a prominent role in St Andrew's Cathedral restoration. He was committed to the project and the stonemasons even carved a likeness of his head into the stonework on the roof.<ref name=nswshr-1708/><ref name=nswshr-1708-1708-2>\"Obituary\", ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 10 and 11 November 2012.</ref>\n\n===Chapter house===\nThe erection of a chapter house was first mooted in 1883 to provide a synod hall in memory of Bishop Barker. Its construction was approved unanimously by the chapter and synod. Cyril Blacket, Edmund Blacket's son was appointed architect. The foundation stone was laid on 30 November 1885 and construction completed in 1886. The choice of site was limited, the south west corner of the site being the only vaguely suitable one. Even this was restricted. In 1916 additions enlarging the chapter house were completed by Wiltshire and Day. Calls for further enlargement continued but nothing was done due to the difficulty of the task.<ref name=nswshr-1708/> The ''St Andrew's Cathedral Conservation Plan, 1999'' by [[Paul Davies]] contains further detailed information on the chapter house, external works and structures, additions to the cathedral exterior, internal layout, 1941 reorientation, ventilation, organs, bells, architects and furniture.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n== Description ==\nSt Andrew's Cathedral and its chapter house are sited in the major civic and ceremonial precinct of Sydney and are key elements in the streetscape and townscape.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n===Cathedral building===\nSt Andrew's Cathedral is one of the major Gothic buildings of Sydney and even though small in comparison to many cathedrals is well executed showing the hand of architect Blacket. It is a Gothic Revival cathedral in Sydney freestone of the late Colonial and Early Victorian periods. The exterior has weathered to a mellow warm brown colour which adds to the rich texture created by delicate Gothic windows, well-proportioned towers and buttressing and multiplicity of decorated [[pinnacle]]s. The main roof is slate.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nThe cathedral has a largely tessellated tile floor with raised timber sections under most pews. The ceilings in the main space of the Cathedral are stained and painted timber.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nThe windows fall into three classes, stained glass with their protective glazing, leaded light windows and plain windows or other miscellaneous windows. The building contains many fine stained glass windows by local stained glass artists including Ashwin and Falconer and Norman Carter.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nThe cathedral houses a collection of furniture, fixtures and fittings that date from the time of construction, the temporary cathedral and various significant changes. It also houses a large collection of memorials both as furnishings and fittings and in the form of plaques.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>  The stone pulpit was a gift of merchant [[Robert Towns]].<ref name=\"Pearl1967\">{{cite book|last=Pearl|first=Cyril |title=Morrison of Peking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFQCAAAAMAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Angus and Robertson|location=Sydney|p=16}}</ref>\n\n====Interior====\nThe interior is a harmonious composition in Perpendicular Gothic. Although the building is small, it is given a sense of grandeur by the proportions of the arcade and clerestory, the richness of the moldings, the loftiness of the [[hammerbeam roof]] with its blue and vermillion decoration, and the decorative details, which include carved stone ribbons around the nave piers, bearing the names of notables in the early Sydney church.\n\nThe stone used throughout is [[Sydney sandstone]]. The chancel has a newly restored floor in ornate pattern set with marble and intaglio tiles in the [[Cosmatesque|Cosmati style]] by Fields of London, created under the direction of [[Gilbert Scott]]. The rest of the building is paved with encaustic tiles of red and black with small intaglio designs by [[Mintons Ltd|Mintons]] of [[Stoke-on-Trent]].\n[[File:St Andrews Sydney windows E3 Resurrection.JPG|thumb|left|<center>''The Resurrection''</center>  One of the series of 27 windows witnessing the life and teachings of Jesus, by [[Hardman & Co.]] of Birmingham]].\n\nThe [[reredos]] was commissioned by the third Bishop of Sydney, Bishop Barry, and carved of translucent cream English [[alabaster]] by the sculptor [[Thomas Earp (sculptor)|Thomas Earp]], under the supervision of the well-known [[Gothic Revival]] architect [[J. L. Pearson]] in 1886. The subject matter of the three pictorial panels, as originally created, were: at the centre, the [[Crucifixion]]; to the left, the [[Resurrection]]; to the right, the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]]. To either side were the figures of [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]]. In 1887 there was objection at synod to the representational nature of the reredos and in particular to the central Crucifixion on the grounds that it might be seen as [[idolatry|idolatrous]]. The Crucifixion was replaced, at the expense of the objectors, by the present scene of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]]. Both depictions of Moses, like the famous sculpture by [[Michelangelo]] in [[San Pietro in Vincoli]], Rome show him with horns, a symbolic attribute due to a mistranslation in the [[Vulgate]] Bible.\n\nThe original furniture of the chancel, of which most remains, is of different dates, but for the most part in the Gothic style. The original choir stalls, of dark English oak, are particularly fine, having large poppy heads, each richly carved with a different foliate design. These were removed under Dean Phillip Jensen, but were reinstated following his departure.\n\n====Windows====\nThe lower stained-glass windows are one of the earliest complete cycles of glass by [[Hardman of Birmingham]] and demonstrate the skilful employment of primary colour, elegant design and narrational intelligence that is typical of the work of John Hardman Powell. They represent the life and the [[parables]] of Jesus.\n\nThe seven-light and four-tiered east window is a complex composition showing scenes in the life of Christ at which the [[St Andrew|Apostle Andrew]] was present, such as the Feeding of the Five Thousand. The west window has tiers of Apostles.\n\n====Orientation and reorientation====\nSt Andrew's Cathedral is built to the ''[[cruciform]]'' shape traditional of Christian churches and symbolic of the faith. The body of the cathedral, or ''[[nave]]'', with lower aisles on either side, is crossed by the ''[[transept]]'', forming a ''[[chancel]]'' for the seating of clergy and choir at the eastern end. The sides of the ''[[Choir (architecture)|choir]]'' are traditionally known as ''[[cantoris]]'', the side of the [[precentor]], or cantor, and ''[[decani]]'', the side of the [[Dean (religion)|dean]], the senior clerical appointee within the cathedral. ''See [[Cathedral architecture]] and [[Cathedral diagram]].''\n[[File:St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney, Australia.JPG|thumb|The East End, with the entrance that was made in 1941]]\n\nIt is customary for cathedrals to be orientated on an east-west axis with the main door to the west and the sanctuary to the east. St Andrew's conformed to that tradition. But a major thoroughfare, George Street, runs by the eastern rather than the western end, making the main entrance less accessible. It also meant that when an electric tram system was installed in the street, the noise frequently drowned out the service of [[Holy Communion]].\n\nIn 1941 the interior was therefore reoriented. A new raised chancel floor was built in the west end, the west door was permanently closed and the [[reredos]] was placed immediately in front of it. All the internal fittings of the chancel were relocated, the positioning of the reredos right against the wall creating some extra space. There was a claim that the acoustics were improved but this is spurious.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} While, on one hand, the trams would not have seemed so loud, being more remote, the negative effects on the internal acoustics were significant and a very large number of choristers were employed to make themselves heard.\n\nIn 1999\u20132000 major conservation and restoration work was undertaken to restore the original internal layout, whereby the [[sanctuary]] was relocated at the cathedral's eastern end. This was achieved under deanship of the Very Reverend [[Boak Jobbins]]. As part of the reorientation and conservation, the Whitely organ was removed from the north transept gallery, thus revealing one of the larger of Hardman's windows including, notably and somewhat controversially, the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], the only depiction in the entire cathedral, together with the crucifixions of the saints Andrew and Peter.\n\n===Changes===\nTo avoid any potential confusion of the communion table with an altar, the strongly [[Churchmanship|Evangelical]] diocesan leadership decided that the communion table should be placed in a more forward position in the chancel and that it should be easily portable in order that it might be removed when not required for Holy Communion, to clear a space for presentations and musical performances. A new table, of a simple, square and modern design, was installed. It was suggested by some traditional Anglicans that the older table, with its ornate carving, should be retained in its usual place in front of the reredos. It is not unusual for cathedrals in England, because of their vast size, to have tables in two positions. But as this was not the case in Sydney it was decided to abandon the old table rather than maintaining it at the risk of it being associated with the \"High Altar\" of Roman Catholic and many Anglican churches (the communion table in an Anglican church in Sydney must be of wood and be able to be moved). In addition, a major consideration in not retaining the old table was that it was riddled with termite damage, a perpetual problem in the centre of Sydney.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nSince the departure of Phillip Jensen, the old choir stalls have been reinstalled in their former position, and the more modern temporary ones are not in use. The eagle lecterns have been reinstated. The mobile \"holy table, known as \"Meals-on-Wheels\",{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} is still in use.\n\nOne of the treasures of the cathedral is the [[Great Bible]] of 1539 (printed at the date when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] ordered that every church should have a Bible in the English language). It was donated to St Andrew's by the church of St Andrew's Barnwell in Northamptonshire, United Kingdom, in thanksgiving for the Australia's generosity to post war-Britain. The prominent positioning of the Bible (in its glass case) at the side of the reredos is illustrative of the Sydney diocese's emphasis on belief in the Bible as the authoritative \"Word of God\". The emphasis of Sydney Anglican theology on an understanding of [[scripture]], as against experiential spirituality, is confirmed by the apparent precedence of the book over the [[sacrament]].\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 7 July 2003, Physical condition is good.

The Whitely was removed from the north transept gallery. The organ, as reconstituted by Letourneau, consists of four manuals with mechanical action, comprising the rebuilt Hill organ, together with the best of the Whitely pipework.\n\nThere are regular Thursday afternoon recitals by Australian and international organists, commencing at 1:10 pm and usually lasting for 30 or 40 minutes.

This makes the cathedral choir the oldest continuous musical institution in Australia. There have been several notable alumni of the choir, two of the most prominent non-musicians being Australia's first prime minister, [[Sir Edmund Barton]], and the pioneer aviator [[Sir Charles Kingsford Smith]]. In 1885 [[St Andrew's Cathedral School]] was founded by the third Bishop of Sydney, Bishop Barry, for the purpose of providing choristers to sing the daily services at the cathedral. For many years the enrolment stood at 46 boys and the headmaster was also the Master of Choristers and precentor of the cathedral. The school began to expand in 1941 and for many years in the latter part of the 20th century the enrolment stood at 700 and catered for boys from Years 3 to 12. In 1999 girls were admitted to senior years and in 2008 St Andrew's Cathedral School became fully co-educational from kindergarten.\n\nIn 2004 the former dean altered the form of service in the cathedral in keeping with his inclination to rationalise the worship on \"Sydney Anglican\" principles. This had decreased the formal participation of the cathedral choir and has been met by some controversy.{{efn|\"Peter Phillips is conductor of one of the world's most famous choirs, The Tallis Scholars, as well as being a regular columnist for ''The Spectator''.

The most recent international tour was to Europe in July 2008 and was made to mark the 140th anniversary of the choir. The choir sang in Bristol Cathedral (with the world-renowned Black Dyke Colliery Band), Wells Cathedral, Bath Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral, London in the presence of the Australian High Commissioner.

Kirkpatrick, built {{circa|1890}}) and the former Bank of New South Wales ([[facade]] only), 485 George Street (designed by Varney Parkes, built 1894).\n\n=== New South Wales State Heritage Register ===\nAs at 1 July 2003, St Andrew's Cathedral is one of the finest Gothic-revival church buildings in New South Wales and is the pre-eminent church building within the Sydney Anglican Diocese. The building represents the aspirations of the Colony and was the focus of much of Sydney life both during and after its construction. The completion of the Cathedral building was a major achievement for both the church and the [[City of Sydney]]. The building has high spiritual significance for both Anglicans and the wider community. It has been the \"State\" church for many major events. The building group has high aesthetic significance as a finely crafted and detailed group of structures. The Cathedral interior has high aesthetic value, even in its altered form, containing much of the original furniture and fittings including the Hill organ. The Cathedral contains a very fine and significant set of stained glass windows that predominantly date from the time of construction. The Cathedral has historic significance as it has reflected the growth of the Anglican Church and changes in Anglicanism and for its associations with prominent church and civic persons.<ref name=nswshr-1708-1708-4/><ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nSt Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 3 September 2004 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Andrew's Cathedral is of historic significance as the place of the first cathedral to be commenced in Australia. It reflects the changing views and attitudes both theological and social within the Diocese of Sydney in the physical changes that have taken place to the building. The collection of furniture, fixtures, artefacts and memorials record the history of the building, the history of the Anglican church in Sydney and key personalities involved in both church and civic life who have been associated with the building, the link between the building and the wider church with relics and items from other churches throughout the world and a tradition in quality of craftsmanship and design which can be seen from the 1860s to the present day. Its place in the development of architectural design and thought in the colony, as a perfect example of the colonial desire to reproduce England in Australia in the mid-nineteenth century which affected the design of many churches to follow in the colony. It is an example of the connection and inter-relationship of Church and State in the Colonial and Victorian periods. The Hill Organ, 1866, the first of approximately 40 organs they provided to NSW and one of the last to be made by Hill before his death. The Kinloch organ, the second organ to be built in the [[Colony of New South Wales]].<ref name=nswshr-1708-1708-4>Davies, 1999.</ref><ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nIts association with Edmund Blacket the most prominent architect of the period who was responsible for forming much of the character of Sydney in the mid-nineteenth century. It is association with a series of significant architects in Sydney including Cyril Blacket, [[Burcham Clamp]], Wiltshire and Day and Professor Leslie Wilkinson all of whom made contributions to the building in both additions and maintenance of the fabric.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Andrew's Cathedral is of aesthetic significance for the high quality of the Gothic design and detailing of the building. It is one of the major Gothic buildings in Sydney and even though small in comparison to many cathedrals is well executed showing the hand of Blacket. It has strong visual qualities within the Sydney Square precinct. The building has a very fine interior and houses a collection of furniture, fixtures and fittings that date from the time of construction. With the exception of several smaller additions identified as not having significance the buildings form a unified complex which, even though sited on a restricted site provide a group envisaged by Blacket. The cathedral is sited in the major civic and ceremonial precinct in the city and is a key element in the streetscape and townscape of the city. It is a landmark building that is widely recognised and admired by the community. Although altered, the Hill organ is a fine instrument with a very good tonal quality. The organ case and pipework are an important element of the cathedral interior. The addition of the Kinloch organ to the cathedral enhances the music and appearance of the interior.<ref name=nswshr-1708-1708-4/><ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nSt Andrew's Cathedral is of social significance as the location of major State occasions which have high social value to the community in general and to specific groups within the community. It is a tourist attraction drawing each year several thousand Australian and overseas tourists.

The cathedral is the seat of the [[Anglican Archbishop of Sydney]] and [[Metropolitan bishop]] of [[New South Wales]], currently the Most Reverend [[Glenn Davies]], elected August 2013. The dean, appointed in May 2015, is the Very Reverend [[Kanishka Raffel]].\n\nThe St Andrew's has an Evangelical ministry, holding services every day, including a weekly healing service.  There is a cathedral choir of men and boys who sing during term time, as well as a company of bell ringers. The notable pipe organ has been restored and is regularly used for recitals and concerts.\n \nDesigned primarily by [[Edmund Blacket]] on foundations laid by [[James Hume (architect)|James Hume]], the cathedral was built from 1837 to 1868, and was ready for services and consecrated in 1868, making it the oldest cathedral in Australia.\n\nSt Andrew's is one of the city's finest examples of [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. Joan Kerr described the cathedral as \"a perfect example of the colonial desire to reproduce England in Australia in the mid nineteenth century.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Kerr, Joan |title=Our Great Victorian Architect, Edmund Thomas Blacket |year=1983 |publisher=National Trust of Australia |isbn=0-909723-17-6}}</ref>\n\nThe cathedral is located at 1400 [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] in the [[Sydney central business district]], in the [[City of Sydney]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. St Andrew's is owned by Anglican Church Property Trust. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 3 September 2004;<ref name=nswshr-1708/> is listed on the City of Sydney local government [[heritage register]];<ref name=\"SHR2\"/> and is listed on the (now defunct) [[Register of the National Estate]].<ref name=AHD>{{cite AHD|1905|St Andrews Anglican Cathedral and Chapter House|date=21 March 1978|accessdate=1 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early construction 1811-{{circa|1874}}===\n====Macquarie and Greenway====\nA cathedral was planned by [[Governors of New South Wales|Governor]] [[Lachlan Macquarie]] to be an impressive building in the centre of Sydney within a large square which would contain major civic buildings. He foresaw that Sydney would grow into a large city requiring a large cathedral. With the architect [[Francis Greenway]], who had been transported to Sydney for forgery, Macquarie planned a church {{convert|200|ft|m|0|order=flip|adj=on}} square and probably with the seating and galleries facing inward from three sides. The foundation stone was laid with full ceremony on 31 August 1819. Only a few foundations were laid, however, before the plan was abandoned. It was later moved to accommodate development under [[Richard Bourke|Governor Bourke]] to make [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] straight rather than interrupted by a large square. Macquarie's plans were abandoned with the appointment of [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] to the colony and [[St James Church, Sydney|St James']] was constructed in place of the proposed cathedral as a church for Sydney.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nMacquarie's vision has since been realised with the construction of the present cathedral and later [[Sydney Town Hall]].<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n====Broughton and Hume====\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal \n | header_align = center\n | header    =\n | image1    = St Andrews Cathedral Sydney Dean Cowper.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = W.

The plans, prepared by the architect [[James Hume (architect)|James Hume]], were of much more modest proportions and were for a traditional cruciform church in the [[Gothic Architecture|Gothic style]]. The designs, dating from the early phase of Gothic Revival architecture, did not show a great expertise in the handling of the particular architectural vocabulary. Only one notable section was completed, the fa\u00e7ade of the south transept. However, the foundations were laid and some of the walls were constructed up to a height of about {{convert|15|ft|m|0|order=flip}}.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n[[File:St Andrews facade.jpg|thumb|left|The west front demonstrates Blacket's mastery of Gothic design.]]\n\nRevival of interest was partly due to the Church Act of 1836 which provided [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Colonial Government]] subsidies for new church construction. In this case, {{Australian pound|1,000}} and finances for a dean was provided. The cathedral was the most prominent of the eight churches commenced under this scheme and the major church building designed by Hume. It was also the first attempt in the colony to produce accurate details from medieval sources. The [[Conrad Martens]] [[lithograph]] influenced much of the church design that followed. Work on the building again ceased in 1842 due to the combined effects of drought and economic depression in the colony.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n====Edmund T. Blacket====\n{{main|Edmund Blacket}}\nIn 1842 [[Edmund Blacket|Edmund Thomas Blacket]] presented himself to Bishop Broughton with a letter from the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] recommending his talent as an architect and having equal facility in both the [[Classical Architecture|Classical]] and the Gothic style. He was eventually to become known as the [[Christopher Wren|Wren]] of Sydney, having designed two universities, three cathedrals and fifty or more parish churches as well as banks, offices, bridges, mansions and countless shops, cottages and terraced houses. Blacket became the official Colonial Architect from 1849 to 1854.\n\nBlacket was an inventive and stylish [[Gothic Revival]] architect who utilised the forms of English Medieval prototypes reproduced in the books of his architectural library to produce designs which, although archeologically \"correct\", are often highly original. This was just as well, because the task that he inherited from Hume was not an easy one. It took some convincing to get the bishop to accept his deviations from the original design. The problem was how to make an imposing cathedral on foundations which were only the size of a large English parish church. Taking into account what Hume had done and the fact that some of Hume's rather amateurish window tracery was already in place, Blacket designed the cathedral in the style known as [[Perpendicular Gothic]], used extensively at the cathedrals of [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]], [[Winchester Cathedral|Winchester]] and [[York Minster|York]].\n\nBlacket enlarged the building by two bays in length and added the central tower. He also proceeded to change the overall form and detailing of the building. In October 1850 six bishops of Australasia met in Sydney for a conference. Someone suggested that as there were six pillars in the nave of the cathedral each should bear the name of one of the Bishops. William Grant Broughton, Bishop of Sydney and Metropolitan; [[George Augustus Selwyn]], Bishop of New Zealand; [[Francis Russell Nixon]], Bishop of [[Tasmania]]; [[Augustus Short]], Bishop of [[Adelaide]]; [[Charles Perry (bishop)|Charles Perry]], Bishop of [[Melbourne]] and [[William Tyrrell (bishop)|William Tyrell]], Bishop of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]. The pillars were so named. In 1868 the [[Duke of Edinburgh]] attended St Andrew's for an organ recital.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n[[File:St Andrews Sydney 03 interior c.jpg|thumb|Looking east during the restoration of 2000, with scaffolding in front of the east window]]\nWith the repetition of forms and the strongly vertical lines characteristic of [[Perpendicular Gothic]], Blacket succeeded in creating a building which, despite its small size, is nevertheless imposing and of harmonious proportions. The western front with its layered decoration is a majestic composition, based loosely on that of [[York Minster]]. The strongly projecting rectangular buttresses, which transform by stages into lofty octagonally-sectioned pinnacles, and the complex molding around the portals casts varied shadows in the bright Australian sunlight. Kinsela describes it as ''\u201ca grand fa\u00e7ade with superb towers\u2026Covered with a profusion of ornanament, blind traceries and tiny attached pinnacles, in a light-hearted yet elegant manner.\u201d''<ref>{{cite book |author=Kinsela, Joseph |title=St Andrew's Cathedral, a pictorial History and Guide |year=1986 |publisher=Argyle Press |isbn=0-909625-95-6}}</ref>\n\nBishop Broughton did not live to consecrate St Andrew's. He died while on a trip to England in 1853 and is buried in Canterbury Cathedral. The second Bishop of Sydney, [[Frederic Barker|Frederick Barker]], consecrated the completed building on St Andrew's Day, 30 November 1868. Seven out of nine Australian bishops were present at the opening. By 1874 the cathedral was substantially complete, including the western towers. The external form of the building had been finished, the building was furnished and changes had already commenced to the interior. Problems were detected due to water and ventilation which Blacket attended to with varying degrees of success.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n===Development of the cathedral: 1874-1968===\nMinor work was still taking place to the cathedral building from 1874. Fifteen years after opening, large scale cleaning and maintenance of the fabric and furnishings was required, to which Blacket responded.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nWithin 10 years of the 1874 completion the question of size was raised. Attendances at services had grown and on special occasions hundreds were turned away. In 1886 Bishop [[Barry, New South Wales|Barry]] said enlarging the cathedral was a question to face. He suggested the possibility of doubling its size. During 1883 proposals were made for a suitable memorial to Bishop Barker the second Bishop of Sydney. The chapter house was decided on, to be also used as a synod hall. This suggestion was aligned with Barker's advocacy of synodical government. The building was designed by the Blacket Brothers and was opened by Lord Carrington and used for the first time at the general synod in October 1886. In the meantime, [[St Andrew's Cathedral School]] was established in 1885 to provide choristers to sing at daily services, a strong tradition that has continued.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nDuring 1884, J. Pearson was commissioned to prepare designs for the reredos. Work was finally completed in November 1888 following delays with approval of design, carving and erection of the reredos.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nIn 1898 a meeting was held at [[Government House, Sydney|Government House]] and a committee formed to clear off a debt of 7,200 pounds on cathedral property. Further changes to the cathedral proceeded up to 1900. Ongoing problems were encountered with the stonework and water damage. In 1903 the choir stalls were relocated to Blacket's original plan. It seems constant maintenance and deterioration of the building reached a point of frustration for Blacket who provided a detailed explanation of how the building weathered and suggested remedies. A maintenance person was not engaged.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nA number of minor works were undertaken over almost 10 years then in 1916, the next major change took place. The chapter house and new vestries were completed. From 1924 to 1941 works continued when proposals to relocate or enlarge the building were mooted. A series of actual and proposed land resumptions by the Sydney City Council and [[New South Wales Government Railways]] took place in the 1920s and 1930s and discussions took place as to whether the cathedral should be moved to another area of the city. In 1935 the St Andrew's Cathedral Site Act fixed the cathedral site to the land between Kent, George and [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] Streets and the town hall, providing security of tenure. The St Andrew's place subcommittee was formed to recommend treatment of the newly acquired space. In 1937 a competition was launched for proposals to increase the size of the cathedral to seat 2000 to 3000 people. Thirty designs were entered and first place was awarded to R. A. P. Pickney and A. F. E. Gott of London. Much discussion and negotiation took place and some endorsements were made in principal by the St Andrew's building committee. In 1940 the decision was made not to reappoint the building committee and vest its powers in the standing committee. This committee appointed a sub-committee to report on the issue. In the meantime war had broken out and extensions to the cathedral were abandoned as were plans for redevelopment of the site. There was some discussion as to rearranging the interior of the cathedral. The most likely explanation for this change was the geographic changes. When the cathedral was built it was central to its population and had its main entrance in \"a street of churches\". By the 1930s there were fewer living west of Kent Street and the convenient approach for most people was probably the east. In 1941 the cathedral was reoriented. Between 1942 and 1960 emphasis shifted to work on the exterior of the building taking precedence over any other. During World War Two the cathedral was involved with major activities such as the CENEF huts and has had on ongoing social program operating since.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n===Restoration of the cathedral: 1968-present===\nBy 1970 a more comprehensive plan addressing maintenance was required as problems had accelerated. The architects Anchor Murray and Woolley were engaged to prepare a report which was presented to the cathedral chapter in February 1972.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nA synopsis of the report sets the basis for the work that took place over 15 years. The report addressed the structure, fabric, fixed furnishings and interior elements. Ancher Mortlock and Woolley reported again in 1979. All work was carried out in conjunction with the National Trust and the government architect.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nExpenditure on restoration totalled approximately 1.2 million dollars. No further work took place until 1990 when a detailed maintenance study was prepared by Partridge and Davies, architects. This study detailed a long term maintenance program addressing small scale works on a long term basis rather than large scale projects. Work has since been carried out by craftsmen and tradespeople on the basis of funds available. It is hoped a long term stonework program be developed over the next year which is urgently required.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nIn 1999 work to the building reversed the orientation and reinstated the surviving Edmund Blacket fitout and removed all of the 20th-century fitout.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nThe cathedral continues to play a significant role in the community and maintain a role in the ceremonial life of the people of New South Wales, one of the most recent{{when|date=December 2018}} being the state funeral of [[Charles Perkins (Aboriginal activist)|Charles Perkins]], Aboriginal politician and activist and each year several thousand tourists visit. Numerous volunteers offer assistance for activities and administration, including guides who give tours of the cathedral. Increasingly St Andrew's draws its members from the wider metropolitan area. The principal use of the church continues to be for church services - ordinary and special services for the community and organisations and \"occasional\" services - baptisms, weddings and funerals. It is important to note that the cathedral and chapter house hold a collection of furniture, fixtures, artefacts and memorials that reflect the history of the building and the personalities and some items from churches throughout the world.<ref name=nswshr-1708/><ref name=nswshr-1708-1708-4/>\n\nThe Reverend [[Boak Jobbins]] (1947-2012) played a prominent role in St Andrew's Cathedral restoration. He was committed to the project and the stonemasons even carved a likeness of his head into the stonework on the roof.<ref name=nswshr-1708/><ref name=nswshr-1708-1708-2>\"Obituary\", ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 10 and 11 November 2012.</ref>\n\n===Chapter house===\nThe erection of a chapter house was first mooted in 1883 to provide a synod hall in memory of Bishop Barker. Its construction was approved unanimously by the chapter and synod. Cyril Blacket, Edmund Blacket's son was appointed architect. The foundation stone was laid on 30 November 1885 and construction completed in 1886. The choice of site was limited, the south west corner of the site being the only vaguely suitable one. Even this was restricted. In 1916 additions enlarging the chapter house were completed by Wiltshire and Day. Calls for further enlargement continued but nothing was done due to the difficulty of the task.<ref name=nswshr-1708/> The ''St Andrew's Cathedral Conservation Plan, 1999'' by [[Paul Davies]] contains further detailed information on the chapter house, external works and structures, additions to the cathedral exterior, internal layout, 1941 reorientation, ventilation, organs, bells, architects and furniture.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n== Description ==\nSt Andrew's Cathedral and its chapter house are sited in the major civic and ceremonial precinct of Sydney and are key elements in the streetscape and townscape.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n===Cathedral building===\nSt Andrew's Cathedral is one of the major Gothic buildings of Sydney and even though small in comparison to many cathedrals is well executed showing the hand of architect Blacket. It is a Gothic Revival cathedral in Sydney freestone of the late Colonial and Early Victorian periods. The exterior has weathered to a mellow warm brown colour which adds to the rich texture created by delicate Gothic windows, well-proportioned towers and buttressing and multiplicity of decorated [[pinnacle]]s. The main roof is slate.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nThe cathedral has a largely tessellated tile floor with raised timber sections under most pews. The ceilings in the main space of the Cathedral are stained and painted timber.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nThe windows fall into three classes, stained glass with their protective glazing, leaded light windows and plain windows or other miscellaneous windows. The building contains many fine stained glass windows by local stained glass artists including Ashwin and Falconer and Norman Carter.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nThe cathedral houses a collection of furniture, fixtures and fittings that date from the time of construction, the temporary cathedral and various significant changes. It also houses a large collection of memorials both as furnishings and fittings and in the form of plaques.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>  The stone pulpit was a gift of merchant [[Robert Towns]].<ref name=\"Pearl1967\">{{cite book|last=Pearl|first=Cyril |title=Morrison of Peking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFQCAAAAMAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Angus and Robertson|location=Sydney|p=16}}</ref>\n\n====Interior====\nThe interior is a harmonious composition in Perpendicular Gothic. Although the building is small, it is given a sense of grandeur by the proportions of the arcade and clerestory, the richness of the moldings, the loftiness of the [[hammerbeam roof]] with its blue and vermillion decoration, and the decorative details, which include carved stone ribbons around the nave piers, bearing the names of notables in the early Sydney church.\n\nThe stone used throughout is [[Sydney sandstone]]. The chancel has a newly restored floor in ornate pattern set with marble and intaglio tiles in the [[Cosmatesque|Cosmati style]] by Fields of London, created under the direction of [[Gilbert Scott]]. The rest of the building is paved with encaustic tiles of red and black with small intaglio designs by [[Mintons Ltd|Mintons]] of [[Stoke-on-Trent]].\n[[File:St Andrews Sydney windows E3 Resurrection.JPG|thumb|left|<center>''The Resurrection''</center>  One of the series of 27 windows witnessing the life and teachings of Jesus, by [[Hardman & Co.]] of Birmingham]].\n\nThe [[reredos]] was commissioned by the third Bishop of Sydney, Bishop Barry, and carved of translucent cream English [[alabaster]] by the sculptor [[Thomas Earp (sculptor)|Thomas Earp]], under the supervision of the well-known [[Gothic Revival]] architect [[J. L. Pearson]] in 1886. The subject matter of the three pictorial panels, as originally created, were: at the centre, the [[Crucifixion]]; to the left, the [[Resurrection]]; to the right, the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]]. To either side were the figures of [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]]. In 1887 there was objection at synod to the representational nature of the reredos and in particular to the central Crucifixion on the grounds that it might be seen as [[idolatry|idolatrous]]. The Crucifixion was replaced, at the expense of the objectors, by the present scene of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]]. Both depictions of Moses, like the famous sculpture by [[Michelangelo]] in [[San Pietro in Vincoli]], Rome show him with horns, a symbolic attribute due to a mistranslation in the [[Vulgate]] Bible.\n\nThe original furniture of the chancel, of which most remains, is of different dates, but for the most part in the Gothic style. The original choir stalls, of dark English oak, are particularly fine, having large poppy heads, each richly carved with a different foliate design. These were removed under Dean Phillip Jensen, but were reinstated following his departure.\n\n====Windows====\nThe lower stained-glass windows are one of the earliest complete cycles of glass by [[Hardman of Birmingham]] and demonstrate the skilful employment of primary colour, elegant design and narrational intelligence that is typical of the work of John Hardman Powell. They represent the life and the [[parables]] of Jesus.\n\nThe seven-light and four-tiered east window is a complex composition showing scenes in the life of Christ at which the [[St Andrew|Apostle Andrew]] was present, such as the Feeding of the Five Thousand. The west window has tiers of Apostles.\n\n====Orientation and reorientation====\nSt Andrew's Cathedral is built to the ''[[cruciform]]'' shape traditional of Christian churches and symbolic of the faith. The body of the cathedral, or ''[[nave]]'', with lower aisles on either side, is crossed by the ''[[transept]]'', forming a ''[[chancel]]'' for the seating of clergy and choir at the eastern end. The sides of the ''[[Choir (architecture)|choir]]'' are traditionally known as ''[[cantoris]]'', the side of the [[precentor]], or cantor, and ''[[decani]]'', the side of the [[Dean (religion)|dean]], the senior clerical appointee within the cathedral. ''See [[Cathedral architecture]] and [[Cathedral diagram]].''\n[[File:St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney, Australia.JPG|thumb|The East End, with the entrance that was made in 1941]]\n\nIt is customary for cathedrals to be orientated on an east-west axis with the main door to the west and the sanctuary to the east. St Andrew's conformed to that tradition. But a major thoroughfare, George Street, runs by the eastern rather than the western end, making the main entrance less accessible. It also meant that when an electric tram system was installed in the street, the noise frequently drowned out the service of [[Holy Communion]].\n\nIn 1941 the interior was therefore reoriented. A new raised chancel floor was built in the west end, the west door was permanently closed and the [[reredos]] was placed immediately in front of it. All the internal fittings of the chancel were relocated, the positioning of the reredos right against the wall creating some extra space. There was a claim that the acoustics were improved but this is spurious.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} While, on one hand, the trams would not have seemed so loud, being more remote, the negative effects on the internal acoustics were significant and a very large number of choristers were employed to make themselves heard.\n\nIn 1999\u20132000 major conservation and restoration work was undertaken to restore the original internal layout, whereby the [[sanctuary]] was relocated at the cathedral's eastern end. This was achieved under deanship of the Very Reverend [[Boak Jobbins]]. As part of the reorientation and conservation, the Whitely organ was removed from the north transept gallery, thus revealing one of the larger of Hardman's windows including, notably and somewhat controversially, the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], the only depiction in the entire cathedral, together with the crucifixions of the saints Andrew and Peter.\n\n===Changes===\nTo avoid any potential confusion of the communion table with an altar, the strongly [[Churchmanship|Evangelical]] diocesan leadership decided that the communion table should be placed in a more forward position in the chancel and that it should be easily portable in order that it might be removed when not required for Holy Communion, to clear a space for presentations and musical performances. A new table, of a simple, square and modern design, was installed. It was suggested by some traditional Anglicans that the older table, with its ornate carving, should be retained in its usual place in front of the reredos. It is not unusual for cathedrals in England, because of their vast size, to have tables in two positions. But as this was not the case in Sydney it was decided to abandon the old table rather than maintaining it at the risk of it being associated with the \"High Altar\" of Roman Catholic and many Anglican churches (the communion table in an Anglican church in Sydney must be of wood and be able to be moved). In addition, a major consideration in not retaining the old table was that it was riddled with termite damage, a perpetual problem in the centre of Sydney.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nSince the departure of Phillip Jensen, the old choir stalls have been reinstalled in their former position, and the more modern temporary ones are not in use. The eagle lecterns have been reinstated. The mobile \"holy table, known as \"Meals-on-Wheels\",{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} is still in use.\n\nOne of the treasures of the cathedral is the [[Great Bible]] of 1539 (printed at the date when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] ordered that every church should have a Bible in the English language). It was donated to St Andrew's by the church of St Andrew's Barnwell in Northamptonshire, United Kingdom, in thanksgiving for the Australia's generosity to post war-Britain. The prominent positioning of the Bible (in its glass case) at the side of the reredos is illustrative of the Sydney diocese's emphasis on belief in the Bible as the authoritative \"Word of God\". The emphasis of Sydney Anglican theology on an understanding of [[scripture]], as against experiential spirituality, is confirmed by the apparent precedence of the book over the [[sacrament]].\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 7 July 2003, Physical condition is good.

The Whitely was removed from the north transept gallery. The organ, as reconstituted by Letourneau, consists of four manuals with mechanical action, comprising the rebuilt Hill organ, together with the best of the Whitely pipework.\n\nThere are regular Thursday afternoon recitals by Australian and international organists, commencing at 1:10 pm and usually lasting for 30 or 40 minutes.

This makes the cathedral choir the oldest continuous musical institution in Australia. There have been several notable alumni of the choir, two of the most prominent non-musicians being Australia's first prime minister, [[Sir Edmund Barton]], and the pioneer aviator [[Sir Charles Kingsford Smith]]. In 1885 [[St Andrew's Cathedral School]] was founded by the third Bishop of Sydney, Bishop Barry, for the purpose of providing choristers to sing the daily services at the cathedral. For many years the enrolment stood at 46 boys and the headmaster was also the Master of Choristers and precentor of the cathedral. The school began to expand in 1941 and for many years in the latter part of the 20th century the enrolment stood at 700 and catered for boys from Years 3 to 12. In 1999 girls were admitted to senior years and in 2008 St Andrew's Cathedral School became fully co-educational from kindergarten.\n\nIn 2004 the former dean altered the form of service in the cathedral in keeping with his inclination to rationalise the worship on \"Sydney Anglican\" principles. This had decreased the formal participation of the cathedral choir and has been met by some controversy.{{efn|\"Peter Phillips is conductor of one of the world's most famous choirs, The Tallis Scholars, as well as being a regular columnist for ''The Spectator''.

The most recent international tour was to Europe in July 2008 and was made to mark the 140th anniversary of the choir. The choir sang in Bristol Cathedral (with the world-renowned Black Dyke Colliery Band), Wells Cathedral, Bath Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral, London in the presence of the Australian High Commissioner.

Kirkpatrick, built {{circa|1890}}) and the former Bank of New South Wales ([[facade]] only), 485 George Street (designed by Varney Parkes, built 1894).\n\n=== New South Wales State Heritage Register ===\nAs at 1 July 2003, St Andrew's Cathedral is one of the finest Gothic-revival church buildings in New South Wales and is the pre-eminent church building within the Sydney Anglican Diocese. The building represents the aspirations of the Colony and was the focus of much of Sydney life both during and after its construction. The completion of the Cathedral building was a major achievement for both the church and the [[City of Sydney]]. The building has high spiritual significance for both Anglicans and the wider community. It has been the \"State\" church for many major events. The building group has high aesthetic significance as a finely crafted and detailed group of structures. The Cathedral interior has high aesthetic value, even in its altered form, containing much of the original furniture and fittings including the Hill organ. The Cathedral contains a very fine and significant set of stained glass windows that predominantly date from the time of construction. The Cathedral has historic significance as it has reflected the growth of the Anglican Church and changes in Anglicanism and for its associations with prominent church and civic persons.<ref name=nswshr-1708-1708-4/><ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nSt Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 3 September 2004 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Andrew's Cathedral is of historic significance as the place of the first cathedral to be commenced in Australia. It reflects the changing views and attitudes both theological and social within the Diocese of Sydney in the physical changes that have taken place to the building. The collection of furniture, fixtures, artefacts and memorials record the history of the building, the history of the Anglican church in Sydney and key personalities involved in both church and civic life who have been associated with the building, the link between the building and the wider church with relics and items from other churches throughout the world and a tradition in quality of craftsmanship and design which can be seen from the 1860s to the present day. Its place in the development of architectural design and thought in the colony, as a perfect example of the colonial desire to reproduce England in Australia in the mid-nineteenth century which affected the design of many churches to follow in the colony. It is an example of the connection and inter-relationship of Church and State in the Colonial and Victorian periods. The Hill Organ, 1866, the first of approximately 40 organs they provided to NSW and one of the last to be made by Hill before his death. The Kinloch organ, the second organ to be built in the [[Colony of New South Wales]].<ref name=nswshr-1708-1708-4>Davies, 1999.</ref><ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nIts association with Edmund Blacket the most prominent architect of the period who was responsible for forming much of the character of Sydney in the mid-nineteenth century. It is association with a series of significant architects in Sydney including Cyril Blacket, [[Burcham Clamp]], Wiltshire and Day and Professor Leslie Wilkinson all of whom made contributions to the building in both additions and maintenance of the fabric.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Andrew's Cathedral is of aesthetic significance for the high quality of the Gothic design and detailing of the building. It is one of the major Gothic buildings in Sydney and even though small in comparison to many cathedrals is well executed showing the hand of Blacket. It has strong visual qualities within the Sydney Square precinct. The building has a very fine interior and houses a collection of furniture, fixtures and fittings that date from the time of construction. With the exception of several smaller additions identified as not having significance the buildings form a unified complex which, even though sited on a restricted site provide a group envisaged by Blacket. The cathedral is sited in the major civic and ceremonial precinct in the city and is a key element in the streetscape and townscape of the city. It is a landmark building that is widely recognised and admired by the community. Although altered, the Hill organ is a fine instrument with a very good tonal quality. The organ case and pipework are an important element of the cathedral interior. The addition of the Kinloch organ to the cathedral enhances the music and appearance of the interior.<ref name=nswshr-1708-1708-4/><ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nSt Andrew's Cathedral is of social significance as the location of major State occasions which have high social value to the community in general and to specific groups within the community. It is a tourist attraction drawing each year several thousand Australian and overseas tourists. It is the home of the Cathedral Choir and staff who have always been housed within the cathedral complex. It has cultural value to the City of Sydney as a venue for concerts and recitals and a place of civic activity. It has been the site of major relief programmes during national crisis and has been one of the key symbols in Sydney of stability and order.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\nSt Andrew's Cathedral is of spiritual significance and its existence is a statement of Christian spiritual values. It has been the focus of Christian worship, including instruction, nurture and evangelism, for members of the Anglican Church in the area since 1868. The physical layout of St Andrew's is of spiritual significance for its symbolism in relating spiritual concepts to earthly forms.<ref name=nswshr-1708-1708-4/><ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Andrew's Cathedral is of technical/research significance for being the most ambitious church building to be undertaken in the colony of a scale seen in England and Europe, but not before in Sydney. The high level of technical skill seen in the execution of the building, particularly the stonework and carving, construction of the towers, stained glass windows, joinery and furniture and innovative organ design.<ref name=nswshr-1708-1708-4/><ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Andrew's Cathedral is rare on a statewide basis as one of the finest Gothic-revival church buildings in New South Wales and is the pre-eminent church building within the Sydney Anglican Diocese.<ref name=nswshr-1708/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe main glass in the cathedral is one of the finest collections of Hardman glass in Australia and represents the work of an important English stained glass artist.<ref name=nswshr-1708/><ref name=nswshr-1708-1708-4/>\n\n===Other heritage registers===\nOn 21 March 1978 the cathedral and chapter house were listed on the (now defunct) [[Register of the National Estate]].<ref name=AHD/><ref>The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p. 2/100</ref> St Andrew's has a [[National Trust of Australia]] heritage listing as being a building of national significance.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Deans of St Andrew's==\nThe following individuals have served as Deans of St Andrew's Cathedral:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneycathedral.com/sites/default/files/files/pdf/History%20of%20Dean%20of%20Sydney%20who%20served%20at%20St%20Andrew%27s%20-%20Mar%202010.pdf|title=History: Dean of Sydney|work=Sydney Cathedral|publisher=Diocese of Sydney|accessdate=25 December 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{Cite web|url=http://www.sydneycathedral.com/s/St-Andrews-Cathedral-Sydney-Officials-History-Clergy-Dean-Canon-etc-9-October-2018.pdf|title=Officials of The Cathedral Church of St Andrew Sydney|work=Sydney Cathedral|publisher=Diocese of Sydney|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref><!-- same ? -->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

However, he knocked the ball on upon further inspection and the [[video referee]], [[Steve Ganson]]  ruled no-try.\n* '''11th Minute:''' New Zealand's good start to the game came to nothing when Billy Slater received the ball on the 40 metre line. He was able to cut through two defenders and run 30 metres before getting a ball away to Darren Lockyer who scored. Johnathan Thurston then missed the conversion. '''Australia 4-0 New Zealand'''\n* '''15th Minute''': David Williams raced down the right hand touchline to score. Thurston kicked the conversion. '''Australia 10-0 New Zealand'''\n* '''20th Minute''': Australia had the chance to effectively put the game out of reach when Darren Lockyer looked to have got on the end of a Cameron Smith grubber kick. Yet, when referee [[Ashley Klein]] went to the video referee it was clear that Lockyer had not grounded the ball and the try was not awarded.\n* '''24th Minute:''' Jeremy Smith went on a barnstorming run from ten metres out to score under the posts. Isaac Luke added the conversion and New Zealand were now back in the game. '''Australia 10-6 New Zealand'''\n* '''28th Minute''': Benji Marshall looked to have lost the ball before David Fa'alogo was able to run away and put Jerome Ropati in to score. However, upon inspection from the video referee the ball was stripped out of Marshall's hands. Therefore, the try stood and, when Luke added the conversion, New Zealand were in the lead for the first time in the match. '''Australia 10-12 New Zealand'''\n* '''35th Minute''': Multiple passes between the Australian players and Lockyer eventually finds room to go over and score. The conversion was added and Australia were back in the lead. '''Australia 16-12 New Zealand'''\n* '''40th Minute''': The halftime siren sounded. New Zealand had surprised many by keeping the score close but many would have believed that Australia would have run away with the game in the second half.\n\nAt halftime [[Justin Morgan (rugby league)|Justin Morgan]] said on the BBC \"It has been a great display from both teams in the first half. The Kiwis have been a little unlucky but they are still in the game and I would like to see them put the ball in the air more in the second half and see if they can get some results.\"\n\n* '''41 Mins''': New Zealand winger Manu Vatuvei is ruled to have put his shoulder on the corner flag as he was going into score a try. Therefore, the try was ruled out.\n* '''47 Mins:''' Lance Hohaia receives the ball after New Zealand received a penalty and stepped past Lockyer before scoring in the tackle. The conversion was added and New Zealand re-took the lead. '''Australia 16-18 New Zealand'''\n* '''58 Mins:''' Israel Folau is held up over the line after picking up a [[bouncing ball]].\n* '''59 Mins:''' Lance Hohaia is bundled towards the New Zealand in-goal after Klein had already called held. Therefore, New Zealand are awarded a penalty under their own goal posts.\n* '''60 Mins:''' On the fourth play, Marshall kicked the ball, Slater gathered it in but, under pressure from Manu Vatuvei, threw the ball in field where Marshall picked the ball up and scored out wide. The kick was unconverted. '''Australia 16-22 New Zealand'''\n* '''64 Mins''': Australia hit back through a try from Greg Inglis in the corner, Thurston, however, could not add the conversion and New Zealand remained in the lead. '''Australia 20-22 New Zealand'''[[File:Kiwis Team Photo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Kiwis celebrating after their victory.]]\n* '''70 Mins''': Nathan Fien grubber kicked the ball through on the last tackle. Lance Hohaia, who was marginally on side ran through to try to catch the ball. The ball bounced awkwardly above the head of the Australian defender Joel Monaghan who could only react by putting out a swinging arm. The ball was then taken by Slater who was tackled in the in goal. After several looks from the video referee it was decided that Hohaia probably would have scored had he not been tackled so a [[Try (rugby)|penalty try]] was awarded. The conversion which would be taken from right under the posts was kicked and New Zealand had an 8-point lead.  '''Australia 20-28 New Zealand'''\n* '''72 Mins''' With the Australians desperate to score Thurston make a line break but with an open line in front of him is ankle tapped by Jeremy Smith and Thurston knocked on. Time was now running out for Australia.\n* '''75 Mins''' Fien kicks for the corner but the ball came loose before Adam Blair eventually picked up and scored. After some looks at the video it was clear that it was a fair try. The conversion was added and New Zealand had effectively won the world cup.\n* '''80 Mins''' The siren for full-time went and the New Zealand players started celebrating.

However, he knocked the ball on upon further inspection and the [[video referee]], [[Steve Ganson]]  ruled no-try.\n* '''11th Minute:''' New Zealand's good start to the game came to nothing when Billy Slater received the ball on the 40 metre line. He was able to cut through two defenders and run 30 metres before getting a ball away to Darren Lockyer who scored. Johnathan Thurston then missed the conversion. '''Australia 4-0 New Zealand'''\n* '''15th Minute''': David Williams raced down the right hand touchline to score. Thurston kicked the conversion. '''Australia 10-0 New Zealand'''\n* '''20th Minute''': Australia had the chance to effectively put the game out of reach when Darren Lockyer looked to have got on the end of a Cameron Smith grubber kick. Yet, when referee [[Ashley Klein]] went to the video referee it was clear that Lockyer had not grounded the ball and the try was not awarded.\n* '''24th Minute:''' Jeremy Smith went on a barnstorming run from ten metres out to score under the posts. Isaac Luke added the conversion and New Zealand were now back in the game. '''Australia 10-6 New Zealand'''\n* '''28th Minute''': Benji Marshall looked to have lost the ball before David Fa'alogo was able to run away and put Jerome Ropati in to score. However, upon inspection from the video referee the ball was stripped out of Marshall's hands. Therefore, the try stood and, when Luke added the conversion, New Zealand were in the lead for the first time in the match. '''Australia 10-12 New Zealand'''\n* '''35th Minute''': Multiple passes between the Australian players and Lockyer eventually finds room to go over and score. The conversion was added and Australia were back in the lead. '''Australia 16-12 New Zealand'''\n* '''40th Minute''': The halftime siren sounded. New Zealand had surprised many by keeping the score close but many would have believed that Australia would have run away with the game in the second half.\n\nAt halftime [[Justin Morgan (rugby league)|Justin Morgan]] said on the BBC \"It has been a great display from both teams in the first half. The Kiwis have been a little unlucky but they are still in the game and I would like to see them put the ball in the air more in the second half and see if they can get some results.\"\n\n* '''41 Mins''': New Zealand winger Manu Vatuvei is ruled to have put his shoulder on the corner flag as he was going into score a try. Therefore, the try was ruled out.\n* '''47 Mins:''' Lance Hohaia receives the ball after New Zealand received a penalty and stepped past Lockyer before scoring in the tackle. The conversion was added and New Zealand re-took the lead. '''Australia 16-18 New Zealand'''\n* '''58 Mins:''' Israel Folau is held up over the line after picking up a [[bouncing ball]].\n* '''59 Mins:''' Lance Hohaia is bundled towards the New Zealand in-goal after Klein had already called held. Therefore, New Zealand are awarded a penalty under their own goal posts.\n* '''60 Mins:''' On the fourth play, Marshall kicked the ball, Slater gathered it in but, under pressure from Manu Vatuvei, threw the ball in field where Marshall picked the ball up and scored out wide. The kick was unconverted. '''Australia 16-22 New Zealand'''\n* '''64 Mins''': Australia hit back through a try from Greg Inglis in the corner, Thurston, however, could not add the conversion and New Zealand remained in the lead. '''Australia 20-22 New Zealand'''[[File:Kiwis Team Photo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Kiwis celebrating after their victory.]]\n* '''70 Mins''': Nathan Fien grubber kicked the ball through on the last tackle. Lance Hohaia, who was marginally on side ran through to try to catch the ball. The ball bounced awkwardly above the head of the Australian defender Joel Monaghan who could only react by putting out a swinging arm. The ball was then taken by Slater who was tackled in the in goal. After several looks from the video referee it was decided that Hohaia probably would have scored had he not been tackled so a [[Try (rugby)|penalty try]] was awarded. The conversion which would be taken from right under the posts was kicked and New Zealand had an 8-point lead.  '''Australia 20-28 New Zealand'''\n* '''72 Mins''' With the Australians desperate to score Thurston make a line break but with an open line in front of him is ankle tapped by Jeremy Smith and Thurston knocked on. Time was now running out for Australia.\n* '''75 Mins''' Fien kicks for the corner but the ball came loose before Adam Blair eventually picked up and scored. After some looks at the video it was clear that it was a fair try. The conversion was added and New Zealand had effectively won the world cup.\n* '''80 Mins''' The siren for full-time went and the New Zealand players started celebrating.
