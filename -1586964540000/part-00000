In recent years, Krauss has become a secondary character who is seen as a supporter of other featured storyline. The character made a return to the front burner one last time with a story about [[Alzheimer's disease]] in 2012. He left the show after his last appearance on 11 September 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deutsche-dailys.de/verbotene-liebe/news/2012-07-31-Konrad-Krauss-steigt-aus|title=Verbotene Liebe > News > Konrad Krauss steigt aus {{!}} Deutsche-Dailys.de|website=www.deutsche-dailys.de|access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nKrauss returned as Arno's spirit for the web special ''Die l\u00e4ngste Nacht von K\u00f6nigsbrunn'' in 2014.\n\n==Creation==\n\n===Characterization===\nThe character of Arno Brandner is considered to be the patriarch of the Brandner family and in the beginning was the middle-class counterpart to the wealthy Christoph von Anstetten. Arno is often showed stubborn when it comes educate his children. All of them enjoyed tough love from him. But Arno is also good-hearted and loves his family. When tragedies strike Arno is one who keeps people calm.\n\nArno is a good businessman, who stands behind his word. He is also known for keeping trust in people, even though they sometimes disappoint him. This is seen several times over the years when Arno is at the edge of losing his business. Arno is shown as someone who works best when he's the one in charge. As he gets silent partners in his construction company in later years, it's shown that Arno can't deal with outside involvement.\n\nHe's considered to be a conservative person but lightened up in later years when it comes topics like homosexuality. Arno himself has been in love several times. He is shown as someone who can love with passion but also acts very realistic for a man of his character when it comes to long-term relationships. Arno cheated on his first wife, while he was cheated on by his second wife. This resulted for both marriages to end.\n\n===Groundbreaking storytelling===\nIn 2012, the producers of the show created a very heartfelt storyline for the character of Arno. After being on the show for seventeen years and actor Konrad Krauss himself being in his 70s, Arno is being diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.daserste.de/unterhaltung/soaps-telenovelas/verbotene-liebe/specials/diagnose-alzheimer-dossier-100.html |title=Diagnose Alzheimer |access-date=20 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714033244/http://www.daserste.de/unterhaltung/soaps-telenovelas/verbotene-liebe/specials/diagnose-alzheimer-dossier-100.html |archive-date=2012-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The storyline got a lot of media attention due to the fact that no other German serial has dealt with the issue. GrundyUFA, the production company of ''Verbotene Liebe'', promoted the story and promised an honest writing of what has about to be the scariest chapter in life.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyqedPfZ2M8 Arno Brandner: Trailer about Alzheimer's disease (German)]</ref> The show offered support and information for people who are suffering Alzheimer's disease or have members in their family who do.\n\nThe portrayal of Krauss in this story is seen as phenomenal and heartbreaking. Arno would slowly lose control over his life, forgetting or misplacing things. Arno appears scared and tries desperately to hold up his old strength. As friends and family witness what happens to Arno, they get worried and want to help. But Arno would try and act normal, even leave people out and hiding episodes.\n\n===Departure===\nOnly weeks after GrundyUFA came out to support and brought awareness to Alzheimer's disease, Krauss' exit was first announced by Deutsche-Dailys and later confirmed by the show itself.<ref name=departure>{{cite web |url=http://www.daserste.de/unterhaltung/soaps-telenovelas/verbotene-liebe/specials/abschied-konrad-krauss-100.html |title=Abschied eines Urgesteins: Konrad Krauss verl\u00e4sst \"Verbotene Liebe\" (German) |publisher=Das Erste |date=6 August 2012 |accessdate=7 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808234012/http://www.daserste.de/unterhaltung/soaps-telenovelas/verbotene-liebe/specials/abschied-konrad-krauss-100.html |archive-date=8 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Reminiscing about his seventeen years as the patriarch of the Brander family, Arno fulfilled his lifelong dream to become an architect and getting to know his grandchildren in his last year on the show.\n\nKrauss' departure was also covered by the tabloid magazine [[Bild]], saying that the role of Arno Brandner was the heart and soul of the show.<ref name=departure1>{{cite web |url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/konrad-krauss/arno-brandner-steigt-aus-25515362.bild.html |title= VERBOTENE LIEBE: Serienurgestein Arno Brandner steigt nach 17 Jahren aus (German) |work=[[Bild]] |first=Ligia Dana |last=Tudorica |date=6 August 2012 |accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref> ''Verbotene Liebe'' without Arno would be unthinkable for fans but would now become a reality.

The young couple plans their future together as Clarissa has the desire to money and power. When she ends up pregnant, both of the lives are shaken up. Arno tries to stay positive and supports Clarissa through her pregnancy. On a rainy night, Arno and Clarissa end up on little pension, owned by the good-hearted Fiona Beckmann. As a surprise to everyone Clarissa ends up giving birth to twins, a boy and a girl. Overwhelmed with the situation, Clarissa decides to walk out on Arno.

Arno eventually meets [[Verbotene Liebe minor characters#Iris Brandner|Iris Sander]]. She becomes a mother to Arno's son [[Jan Brandner|Jan]] and soon his wife.

Even though it's Jan's birthday, father and son clash over Arno's expectations with his son. When Jan eventually is tied to the murder of Fritz Konrad, Arno publicly defends his son while he's on the run. After Jan's name is cleared, Arno has to face that his daughter wants to stay in a relationship with a convicted murderer. He tries to warn Susanne and wants her to stay away from Oliver, but she doesn't listen.\n\nArno finds out that Jan has met his twin-sister [[Julia von Anstetten]].

Arno and Julia slowly build a father-daughter relationship, while she remains close to Clarissa's husband Christoph von Anstetten.\n\nIris never knew about Arno having another child with Clarissa. She feels betrayed and distances herself from Arno. Christoph can't stand the sight of Clarissa anymore. Clarissa and Arno end up sleeping with each other. The affair ends soon enough as Arno knows that Clarissa is never going to change. However, Iris finds out about Arno's affair with Clarissa and ends her marriage with him. She leaves the household and eventually finds a lover in J\u00fcrgen May. She ends up being pregnant by him and dies of an [[ectopic pregnancy]].\n\nArno is unable to mourn Iris in a proper way. He covers himself in work, while feeling the resentment of Florian. He thinks that Iris never would have died if Arno didn't have an affair with Clarissa. Florian eventually forgives his father and moves away while Arno becomes involved with Ela Anders. Arno's relationship with Ela is short lived after his sister-in-law Erika moves in with her two children, Milli and Steffi. Eventually Arno falls for Erika and the two become a couple. In the meanwhile, Julia goes missing after her marriage failed and she tries to have some much needed vacation in [[Lanzarote]]. Arno, Jan, Susanne and the Anstetten family try to find Julia for months but eventually believe she has died of drowning. As Jan prepares to move to Paris with his new girlfriend Kerstin Richter, he receives a letter from Julia. She's alive and well, living in Spain. Julia wants Jan to follow and start a life with her. Even though Arno is against their incestuous relationship, he wants Jan and Julia to be happy. At the last moment, Jan changes his mind and believes that Julia has a better chance at life without him. Jan instead leaves town with Kerstin.\n\nShortly after Jan has left town, Susanne is the next to go while Arno becomes more of a father figure for Erika's children. However, when Clarissa is kidnapped and [[Charlie Schneider]] is in need of Arno's help, their relationship is put to a though time. Arno gets caught up in helping Charlie, who eventually takes a romantic interest in him. Arno resists Charlie but the two form a unique friendship over trying to find Clarissa. In the meanwhile, Erika is jealous with the presence of Charlie in Arno's life. Arno proves to Erika that she's the woman he wants and only has to help Charlie because she has no other to count on. As Clarissa is found and suffers [[amnesia]], Charlie becomes head of Clarissa's estate, which holds shares in 'Brandner Bau'. Charlie tries to get involved into Arno's company. But when he teaches her a lesson, she realizes that she better stays out of it. Arno's relationship with Erika gets more serious as he proposes to her. Erika plans her wedding to Arno as she meets the lesbian waitress Nina Ryan. The two women form a friendship and Nina starts falling for Erika. Even though Erika realizes that she has feelings for Nina too, she wants to marry Arno anyway. However, shortly before the wedding Erika decides to come forward with her feelings towards Nina and breaks off her engagement to Arno.\n\nArno is heartbroken over his split from Erika and ends up sleeping Clarissa. However, nothing more comes of it and Arno soon as to deal with his shady cousin Philipp. He comes to town and eventually starts working for 'Brandner Bau'. Philipp ends up to embezzle money out of the company's accounts to finance himself an expensive lifestyle. Arno has to fight for his lifelong work as Philipp has not only embezzled money but also put a risk at the image of the company. Arno has to lay off people and rebuild parts of his company. Philipp is put on trial after he tried to murder Steffi, who he had a relationship with, and her boyfriend Max Jannsen. After being sentenced he can free himself by force and goes on the run. Arno is never hearing of his cousin again.\n\n===2000\u20132009===\nArno takes another shot at love when he meets [[Elisabeth von Lahnstein|Elisabeth Ryan]], who of all people is Nina's mother. Elisabeth owns Ryan Cosmetics, which was founded by her late husband. Arno is fascinated by Elisabeth but it takes them time to really give in to their relationship. One obstacle is Elisabeth's estranged relationship with Nina. However, in the end it is Arno who can bring both woman closer. As Elisabeth's niece Lara Cornelius shows up in town Nina's relationship with Elisabeth is tested once more. After Elisabeth's sister Irene dies, she confesses to Arno that Lara isn't her niece but her granddaughter; Nina's daughter. Elisabeth felt that Nina was too young to be a mother and therefore Iris raised Lara as her own. After the truth comes out Lara has problems to forgive Elisabeth. Arno again proves to be a mediator and can bring the family together. Elisabeth realizes how lucky she is in her relationship with Arno. As he proposes, Elisabeth doesn't hesitate and she and Arno get married in July 2001.\n\nArno enjoys his young marriage and even reconciles with Clarissa on a friendly basis. However, only hours later, Arno and all other personal friends of Clarissa receive news that her plane got lost from the radar as she was on her way to take a little vacation. After an intensive search, Clarissa was declared to be presumed dead. Arno remembers about Clarissa and is time with her. In a conversation with Charlie, he admits that while Clarissa drove him mad sometimes, he's going to miss her. In the following months, Lara decided to leave town and move to [[Greece]], to where Nina moved after getting the chance to manage a hotel.\n\nHowever Arno and Elisabeth aren't alone for long when Florian returns after living in [[Munich]] for four years. Arno is happy about his son's return and hopes to now finally do right by one of his children. But he soon has to realize that Florian is in control of his own life. Arno is confused as he then is visited by his nieces [[Nico von Lahnstein|Nico]] and [[Jana von Lahnstein|Jana]]. The teenagers show up at their uncles doorstep and are later joined by their brother Robin. Arno soon finds out that his brother [[Verbotene Liebe minor characters#Achim Brandner|Achim]] was overwhelmed with raising three children after the death of his wife Vera and abandoned them instead. Arno wants to provide a home for all three of them and soon finds himself together with Elisabeth fighting for custody. Just as the three have found their place in the Brandner household, Achim shows up. He apologizes for leaving his kids behind and wants to regain their trust. While Robin wants nothing to do with his father, Nico and Jana are soon ready to forgive him. But as Achim finds old letters of his wife that assume that Jana and Nico are not his but rather a product of an affair she had, he runs out on his them again.\n\nNico is determined to find her biological father and starts skipping school when she has a hint of who her father could be. Arno and Elisabeth think Nico is on a school trip, while she is working as a maid. After Arno finds out about Nico's lies, she confesses to him that she has prove that [[Johannes von Lahnstein]] is her biological father. Even though Nico is craving for her real father, she wants nothing to do with Johannes after feeling rejected. Arno takes matters into his hand and talks to Johannes. He and Nico can sort things out and start building a relationship. When Nico decides to move to Johannes and the rest of her newfound family, Arno seems hurt but is told by Nico that he always has a special place in his heart.\n\nIn the meanwhile Florian started a relationship with Isabell Mohr. When he is visited by his old friend Sven Beckmann, he falls for Isabell and eventually rapes her while Florian is out of town. Isabell confesses the rape to Elisabeth, who promises to keep it a secret. When the truth comes out and Arno finds out that Elisabeth knew about the rape, the two start having marital problems. Arno doesn't seem to know if he can trust Elisabeth anymore or if she trusts him still enough. Arno's trust issues drive Elisabeth further away. When she meets the younger Luke Esser who charms Elisabeth, she starts an affair with him. Elisabeth's marriage with Arno seems to be ending as Arno finds out that Luke is a con artist, who is using Elisabeth to let her invest in some real estate project. Arno can warn his wife just in time. Elisabeth and Arno reconcile after he admits to his mistakes.\n\nAs Florian and Isabell get married and later leave town, Elisabeth and Arno have to adjust to changes in their professional life. Arno gets the chance to construct a convention center for 'Lahnstein Holding' while Elisabeth's company falls into pieces by a takeover. The building of the convention center puts 'Brandner Bau' finally on top again, but the joy isn't for long as it comes to light that [[Ansgar von Lahnstein]] and his new business partner, the just-returned, [[Tanja von Anstetten]] are laundering money over the project. The company's future is at risk as Elisabeth becomes a partner in 'Brandner Bau'. However Arno and Elisabeth's business relationship ends when they disagree too much and don't want to jeopardize their marriage.\n\nWhile Robin and Jana go on with their life and leave the Brandner household, Susanne returns to town together with her two adoptive children, [[Paul Brandner|Paul]] and Lisa. She is on the run from her husband [[Verbotene Liebe minor characters#Alex Wiegand|Alex Wiegand]], who has cheated on her. Arno and Elisabeth are willing to let Susanne, Paul and Lisa live with them. Arno is stunned as his daughter soon finds herself in relationship with [[Carla von Lahnstein]]. Having made his own personal experience with homosexuality, when Erika cheated on him with Nina, he's not pleased with Susanne's choice of life. He believes that Susanne tries to prove something to herself after Alex cheated on her. However, as Susanne and Carla's relationship gets stronger, Arno becomes more acceptive and ultimately walks Susanne down the aisle on her wedding to Carla.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Elisabeth has started working for Johannes, who with time has become a friend of Arno's and his family. Johannes is working on setting up a new company with Elisabeth, which causes them to spend late hours together. Arno tries to stay supportive but he and Elisabeth eventually start to fight about her work load. Johannes proves to be a good friend as he listens to Elisabeth and even lets her go early to spend time with her husband. Elisabeth feels drawn to Johannes. Fully aware of their feelings for each other, Elisabeth and Johannes try to fight their attraction. When they get caught kissing by Nico, Elisabeth promises her that things between her and Johannes have stopped before they even started. Nico doesn't necessarily believe Elisabeth but is willing to accept her word for Arno's sake. As Elisabeth continues to work for Johannes the two start having an affair and are finally caught in the act by Arno.\n\nArno falls in depression after his failed marriage to Elisabeth. Susanne tries to get through to her father but is only pushed away. Arno stays home for days and is letting anyone near him. When he decides to go out one night, Arno ends up on a bridge with the intention to end his life. Arno is saved by a vision that gives him back his strength. In the following events, Arno becomes full of hatred towards the Lahnstein family. He starts disrespecting Susanne's marriage to Carla and isn't happy about Jana's relationship with [[Leonard von Lahnstein]]. As Jana's marriage fails because of Leonard's feelings for another woman, he once again shows his hatred for the family by publicly blaming Leonard for Jana's ultimate death.\n\nAs Arno returns from a family reunion, his cousin [[Matthias Brandner|Matthias]] and his wife [[Katja Brandner|Katja]] are stopping by for a visit. Matthias and Katja soon get the chance to work in town and decide to stay permanently with Arno. They are later joined by their children [[Fabian Brandner|Fabian]], [[Lydia von Lahnstein|Lydia]] and [[David Brandner|David]]. Arno often appears as a mediator and advisor in various crisis. He for example supports Matthias after Katja cheated on him with [[Sebastian von Lahnstein]].\n\n===2010\u20132012===\nArno's life takes another dramatic turn as he loses his family home in February 2010. Almost burned to the grounds and filled with a lot of painful history, Arno decides to move on. He ends up living with Charlie in an apartment in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. In the beginning, the two must find ground to make it work. But soon Charlie and Arno enjoy each other's company and are happy to have someone to come home to. As Charlie starts chatting for a new love interest, Arno becomes Charlie's mysterious admirer. Not knowing who they are chatting with, Arno and Charlie get caught up in flirting with each other. Charlie is shocked when she finds out that she has been chatting with Arno for the entire time. Arno and Charlie are curious if there could be more between them. But after a kiss the two decide to stay friends.\n\nArno starts reminiscing about his life after Charlie inherited an old picture of Clarissa. With Jan and Julia's birthday coming up, Arno wants to reconnect with his children. While he hasn't spoken to Julia in about four years, Arno has no idea where Jan is. After almost getting cold feet, Charlie can get Arno to call Julia on her birthday. Julia seems disconcerted about Arno's call but eventually admits to her husband [[Ricardo Mendes]] that she misses her father. Julia decides to invite Arno to [[Majorca]] where she is living now. Arno reunites with her and his grandson [[Timo Mendes|Timo]], trying to let the past stay hidden as Julia doesn't want to talk about her brother Jan or Clarissa for that matter.\n\nArno enjoys his visit and soon finds himself closer to Julia than ever. But then Arno is in for a shock when he sees a very much alive Clarissa. He finds out that Clarissa didn't die but that she innocently spent the last ten years in a South American prison. Arno tells her that he's happy that she is alive but that she has to leave as soon as possible. Clarissa however wants to reunite with her children. After she was also unable to locate Jan she at least wants to reunite with Julia. Arno doesn't want to hurt Julia and tells Clarissa that he won't support her and wants her to leave. But as he talks to Julia and realizes how many unanswered questions she has about Clarissa, Arno wants to help her. When Julia finds out that her mother is still alive, she wants to have nothing to do with Clarissa at first. However Arno can change Julia's mind and the three of them get closer.\n\nArno and Clarissa are stunned when they find out that Jan is living on Majorca, working as a priest. As happy as they are to see their son, Clarissa and Arno fear that the forbidden love of Julia and Jan could destroy their reunion. Clarissa wants Jan to stay away from Julia but the twins eventually meet each other for the first time since what happened in Lanzarote. Arno is warning Julia as she pretty much has Ricardo and Timo told nothing about her family. Arno slowly has to watch how his children are getting closer to each other again to the moment, where Jan is confessing his love for Julia in front of the family. Arno and Jan get into a fight where Jan calls his father out on his hypocrisy and claims that Arno never wanted to see him happy.\n\nArno is thrown apart by his children's tragedy as he gets to a desperate Clarissa. She takes full responsibility and wishes that she would have never left Arno and that they somehow made it work as a family so that Julia and Jan would never fall in love with each other. Timo is furious with Julia over her lies and secrets and breaks all ties with his mother. Ricardo realizes that he isn't the man Julia wants and leaves her. All alone, Jan wants Julia to come with her. But Julia knows if she would follow Jan into a new life she would lose her son forever. Clarissa and Arno take Jan to the airport, who is prepared to start over on his own once again. But somehow Jan feels something is wrong and he rushes back to Julia who almost drowned but was rescued by Timo. He realizes that he wants his mother to be happy and gives her free so she can be with Jan. Back in D\u00fcsseldorf, Arno finds out that his children are now living their forbidden love, still blaming himself for it.\n\nJan's daughter [[Leonie Richter]] and Timo show up in D\u00fcsseldorf as Timo prepares to find out more about his biological father, Julia's first husband Tim Sander. Timo confronts Arno with knowing that Tanja had something to do with Tim's death. Arno wants his grandchildren to stay away from Tanja and tells Timo that she's a dangerous woman. Timo ends up kidnapping Tanja and after that faces prison time. Clarissa and Arno try to support Timo as good as they can. In the end Tanja makes a statement that sets Timo free.\n\nArno starts to have problems with his memories. As Ricardo Mendes, who is a [[neurosurgeon]], wants him to take some tests to find out what's wrong. Arno is diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]].

He left the show after his last appearance on 11 September 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deutsche-dailys.de/verbotene-liebe/news/2012-07-31-Konrad-Krauss-steigt-aus|title=Verbotene Liebe > News > Konrad Krauss steigt aus {{!}} Deutsche-Dailys.de|website=www.deutsche-dailys.de|access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nKrauss returned as Arno's spirit for the web special ''Die l\u00e4ngste Nacht von K\u00f6nigsbrunn'' in 2014.\n\n==Creation==\n\n===Characterization===\nThe character of Arno Brandner is considered to be the patriarch of the Brandner family and in the beginning was the middle-class counterpart to the wealthy Christoph von Anstetten. Arno is often showed stubborn when it comes educate his children. All of them enjoyed tough love from him. But Arno is also good-hearted and loves his family. When tragedies strike Arno is one who keeps people calm.\n\nArno is a good businessman, who stands behind his word. He is also known for keeping trust in people, even though they sometimes disappoint him. This is seen several times over the years when Arno is at the edge of losing his business. Arno is shown as someone who works best when he's the one in charge. As he gets silent partners in his construction company in later years, it's shown that Arno can't deal with outside involvement.\n\nHe's considered to be a conservative person but lightened up in later years when it comes topics like homosexuality. Arno himself has been in love several times. He is shown as someone who can love with passion but also acts very realistic for a man of his character when it comes to long-term relationships. Arno cheated on his first wife, while he was cheated on by his second wife. This resulted for both marriages to end.\n\n===Groundbreaking storytelling===\nIn 2012, the producers of the show created a very heartfelt storyline for the character of Arno. After being on the show for seventeen years and actor Konrad Krauss himself being in his 70s, Arno is being diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.daserste.de/unterhaltung/soaps-telenovelas/verbotene-liebe/specials/diagnose-alzheimer-dossier-100.html |title=Diagnose Alzheimer |access-date=20 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714033244/http://www.daserste.de/unterhaltung/soaps-telenovelas/verbotene-liebe/specials/diagnose-alzheimer-dossier-100.html |archive-date=2012-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The storyline got a lot of media attention due to the fact that no other German serial has dealt with the issue. GrundyUFA, the production company of ''Verbotene Liebe'', promoted the story and promised an honest writing of what has about to be the scariest chapter in life.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyqedPfZ2M8 Arno Brandner: Trailer about Alzheimer's disease (German)]</ref> The show offered support and information for people who are suffering Alzheimer's disease or have members in their family who do.\n\nThe portrayal of Krauss in this story is seen as phenomenal and heartbreaking.

As friends and family witness what happens to Arno, they get worried and want to help. But Arno would try and act normal, even leave people out and hiding episodes.\n\n===Departure===\nOnly weeks after GrundyUFA came out to support and brought awareness to Alzheimer's disease, Krauss' exit was first announced by Deutsche-Dailys and later confirmed by the show itself.<ref name=departure>{{cite web |url=http://www.daserste.de/unterhaltung/soaps-telenovelas/verbotene-liebe/specials/abschied-konrad-krauss-100.html |title=Abschied eines Urgesteins: Konrad Krauss verl\u00e4sst \"Verbotene Liebe\" (German) |publisher=Das Erste |date=6 August 2012 |accessdate=7 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808234012/http://www.daserste.de/unterhaltung/soaps-telenovelas/verbotene-liebe/specials/abschied-konrad-krauss-100.html |archive-date=8 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Reminiscing about his seventeen years as the patriarch of the Brander family, Arno fulfilled his lifelong dream to become an architect and getting to know his grandchildren in his last year on the show.\n\nKrauss' departure was also covered by the tabloid magazine [[Bild]], saying that the role of Arno Brandner was the heart and soul of the show.<ref name=departure1>{{cite web |url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/konrad-krauss/arno-brandner-steigt-aus-25515362.bild.html |title= VERBOTENE LIEBE: Serienurgestein Arno Brandner steigt nach 17 Jahren aus (German) |work=[[Bild]] |first=Ligia Dana |last=Tudorica |date=6 August 2012 |accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref> ''Verbotene Liebe'' without Arno would be unthinkable for fans but would now become a reality.

I remember when I first read a script and asked myself 'Do I want to play it?' I have had my share of discussions with the director and given the role of a face. Contributed to the development.

She leaves the household and eventually finds a lover in J\u00fcrgen May. She ends up being pregnant by him and dies of an [[ectopic pregnancy]].\n\nArno is unable to mourn Iris in a proper way.

When he is visited by his old friend Sven Beckmann, he falls for Isabell and eventually rapes her while Florian is out of town.

The company's future is at risk as Elisabeth becomes a partner in 'Brandner Bau'. However Arno and Elisabeth's business relationship ends when they disagree too much and don't want to jeopardize their marriage.\n\nWhile Robin and Jana go on with their life and leave the Brandner household, Susanne returns to town together with her two adoptive children, [[Paul Brandner|Paul]] and Lisa. She is on the run from her husband [[Verbotene Liebe minor characters#Alex Wiegand|Alex Wiegand]], who has cheated on her. Arno and Elisabeth are willing to let Susanne, Paul and Lisa live with them. Arno is stunned as his daughter soon finds herself in relationship with [[Carla von Lahnstein]]. Having made his own personal experience with homosexuality, when Erika cheated on him with Nina, he's not pleased with Susanne's choice of life. He believes that Susanne tries to prove something to herself after Alex cheated on her. However, as Susanne and Carla's relationship gets stronger, Arno becomes more acceptive and ultimately walks Susanne down the aisle on her wedding to Carla.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Elisabeth has started working for Johannes, who with time has become a friend of Arno's and his family. Johannes is working on setting up a new company with Elisabeth, which causes them to spend late hours together. Arno tries to stay supportive but he and Elisabeth eventually start to fight about her work load. Johannes proves to be a good friend as he listens to Elisabeth and even lets her go early to spend time with her husband. Elisabeth feels drawn to Johannes. Fully aware of their feelings for each other, Elisabeth and Johannes try to fight their attraction. When they get caught kissing by Nico, Elisabeth promises her that things between her and Johannes have stopped before they even started. Nico doesn't necessarily believe Elisabeth but is willing to accept her word for Arno's sake. As Elisabeth continues to work for Johannes the two start having an affair and are finally caught in the act by Arno.\n\nArno falls in depression after his failed marriage to Elisabeth. Susanne tries to get through to her father but is only pushed away. Arno stays home for days and is letting anyone near him. When he decides to go out one night, Arno ends up on a bridge with the intention to end his life. Arno is saved by a vision that gives him back his strength. In the following events, Arno becomes full of hatred towards the Lahnstein family. He starts disrespecting Susanne's marriage to Carla and isn't happy about Jana's relationship with [[Leonard von Lahnstein]]. As Jana's marriage fails because of Leonard's feelings for another woman, he once again shows his hatred for the family by publicly blaming Leonard for Jana's ultimate death.\n\nAs Arno returns from a family reunion, his cousin [[Matthias Brandner|Matthias]] and his wife [[Katja Brandner|Katja]] are stopping by for a visit. Matthias and Katja soon get the chance to work in town and decide to stay permanently with Arno. They are later joined by their children [[Fabian Brandner|Fabian]], [[Lydia von Lahnstein|Lydia]] and [[David Brandner|David]]. Arno often appears as a mediator and advisor in various crisis. He for example supports Matthias after Katja cheated on him with [[Sebastian von Lahnstein]].\n\n===2010\u20132012===\nArno's life takes another dramatic turn as he loses his family home in February 2010. Almost burned to the grounds and filled with a lot of painful history, Arno decides to move on. He ends up living with Charlie in an apartment in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. In the beginning, the two must find ground to make it work. But soon Charlie and Arno enjoy each other's company and are happy to have someone to come home to. As Charlie starts chatting for a new love interest, Arno becomes Charlie's mysterious admirer. Not knowing who they are chatting with, Arno and Charlie get caught up in flirting with each other. Charlie is shocked when she finds out that she has been chatting with Arno for the entire time. Arno and Charlie are curious if there could be more between them. But after a kiss the two decide to stay friends.\n\nArno starts reminiscing about his life after Charlie inherited an old picture of Clarissa. With Jan and Julia's birthday coming up, Arno wants to reconnect with his children. While he hasn't spoken to Julia in about four years, Arno has no idea where Jan is. After almost getting cold feet, Charlie can get Arno to call Julia on her birthday. Julia seems disconcerted about Arno's call but eventually admits to her husband [[Ricardo Mendes]] that she misses her father. Julia decides to invite Arno to [[Majorca]] where she is living now. Arno reunites with her and his grandson [[Timo Mendes|Timo]], trying to let the past stay hidden as Julia doesn't want to talk about her brother Jan or Clarissa for that matter.\n\nArno enjoys his visit and soon finds himself closer to Julia than ever. But then Arno is in for a shock when he sees a very much alive Clarissa. He finds out that Clarissa didn't die but that she innocently spent the last ten years in a South American prison. Arno tells her that he's happy that she is alive but that she has to leave as soon as possible. Clarissa however wants to reunite with her children. After she was also unable to locate Jan she at least wants to reunite with Julia. Arno doesn't want to hurt Julia and tells Clarissa that he won't support her and wants her to leave. But as he talks to Julia and realizes how many unanswered questions she has about Clarissa, Arno wants to help her. When Julia finds out that her mother is still alive, she wants to have nothing to do with Clarissa at first. However Arno can change Julia's mind and the three of them get closer.\n\nArno and Clarissa are stunned when they find out that Jan is living on Majorca, working as a priest. As happy as they are to see their son, Clarissa and Arno fear that the forbidden love of Julia and Jan could destroy their reunion. Clarissa wants Jan to stay away from Julia but the twins eventually meet each other for the first time since what happened in Lanzarote. Arno is warning Julia as she pretty much has Ricardo and Timo told nothing about her family. Arno slowly has to watch how his children are getting closer to each other again to the moment, where Jan is confessing his love for Julia in front of the family. Arno and Jan get into a fight where Jan calls his father out on his hypocrisy and claims that Arno never wanted to see him happy.\n\nArno is thrown apart by his children's tragedy as he gets to a desperate Clarissa. She takes full responsibility and wishes that she would have never left Arno and that they somehow made it work as a family so that Julia and Jan would never fall in love with each other. Timo is furious with Julia over her lies and secrets and breaks all ties with his mother. Ricardo realizes that he isn't the man Julia wants and leaves her. All alone, Jan wants Julia to come with her. But Julia knows if she would follow Jan into a new life she would lose her son forever. Clarissa and Arno take Jan to the airport, who is prepared to start over on his own once again. But somehow Jan feels something is wrong and he rushes back to Julia who almost drowned but was rescued by Timo. He realizes that he wants his mother to be happy and gives her free so she can be with Jan. Back in D\u00fcsseldorf, Arno finds out that his children are now living their forbidden love, still blaming himself for it.\n\nJan's daughter [[Leonie Richter]] and Timo show up in D\u00fcsseldorf as Timo prepares to find out more about his biological father, Julia's first husband Tim Sander. Timo confronts Arno with knowing that Tanja had something to do with Tim's death. Arno wants his grandchildren to stay away from Tanja and tells Timo that she's a dangerous woman. Timo ends up kidnapping Tanja and after that faces prison time. Clarissa and Arno try to support Timo as good as they can. In the end Tanja makes a statement that sets Timo free.\n\nArno starts to have problems with his memories. As Ricardo Mendes, who is a [[neurosurgeon]], wants him to take some tests to find out what's wrong. Arno is diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He doesn't want Timo and Leonie to know but includes his good friend Charlie and ex-wife Elisabeth into what's been happening with him. Even though Arno tries to talk the illness off and keeps symptoms to himself. Arno is scared after he seems to have blacked out hours of a day. As he sees footage of himself and not knowing what he's done, he asks himself what is happening to him. Arno soon realizes that he wants to die with dignity. He starts fantasizing about his late mother and thinks that his time soon will come. Charlie is afraid for Arno and thinks he is about to kill himself.\n\nShe eventually finds him writing goodbye letters. In one he writes about [[Oliver Sabel|Olli]]'s secret sister who starts wondering. While Charlie attempts to keep the secret and tells Olli that Arno wrote the letter in one of his episodes. Arno later promises to keep the secret. Instead he keeps working on his bucket list. As Arno disappeared one night, Charlie finds a note saying that he fulfills a dream of his. Charlie finds him after swimming in the pool of the No Limits.

It is a major part of [[scientific management]] (Taylorism). After its first introduction, time study developed in the direction of establishing [[Standard time in manufacturing|standard times]], while motion study evolved into a technique for improving work methods. The two techniques became integrated and refined into a widely accepted method applicable to the improvement and upgrading of work systems. This integrated approach to work system improvement is known as [[methods engineering]]<ref>Zandin 2001, Section 4, Chapter 1, p.2</ref> and it is applied today to industrial as well as service organizations, including banks, schools and hospitals.<ref>Ben-Gal et. al 2010</ref>\n\n== Time study ==\nTime study is a direct and continuous observation of a task, using a timekeeping device (e.g., decimal minute [[stopwatch]], computer-assisted electronic stopwatch, and videotape camera) to record the time taken to accomplish a task<ref>Groover 2007</ref> and it is often used when:<ref>Salvendy 2001, Section IV.C, Chapter 54</ref>\n* there are repetitive work cycles of short to long duration,\n* wide variety of dissimilar work is performed, or\n* process control elements constitute a part of the cycle.\n\nThe Industrial Engineering Terminology Standard, defines time study as \"a work measurement technique consisting of careful time measurement of the task with a time measuring instrument, adjusted for any observed variance from normal effort or pace and to allow adequate time for such items as foreign elements, unavoidable or machine delays, rest to overcome fatigue, and personal needs.\"<ref>IIE, ANSI 1982</ref>\n\nThe systems of '''time and motion studies''' are frequently assumed to be interchangeable terms, descriptive of equivalent theories. However, the underlying principles and the rationale for the establishment of each respective method are dissimilar, despite originating within the same school of thought.\n\nThe application of science to business problems, and the use of '''time-study methods''' in standard setting and the planning of work, was pioneered by Frederick Winslow Taylor.<ref>Krenn, M 2011, \u2018From Scientific Management to Homemaking: Lillian M.

The split with Taylor in 1914, on the basis of attitudes to workers, meant the Gilbreths had to argue contrary to the trade unionists, government commissions and [[Robert Hoxie]]<ref>Hoxie, R 1915, \u2018Why Organised Labour Opposes Scientific Management\u2019, Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 31, no. 1, pp. 62-85</ref> who believed scientific management was unstoppable.<ref>Nyland, C 1996, \u2018Taylorism, John R. Commons, and the Hoxie Report\u2019, Journal of Economic Issues, vol. 30, no. 4, pp. 985-1016</ref> The Gilbreths were charged with the task of proving that motion study particularly, and scientific management generally, increased industrial output in ways which improved and did not detract from workers' mental and physical strength. This was no simple task given the propaganda fuelling the Hoxie report and the consequent union opposition to scientific management. In addition, the Gilbreths credibility and academic success continued to be hampered by Taylor who held the view that motion studies were nothing more than a continuation of his work.\n\nWhile both Taylor and the Gilbreths continue to be criticized for their respective work, it should be remembered that they were writing at a time of industrial reorganization and the emergence of large, complex organizations with new forms of technology. Furthermore, to equate scientific management merely with time and motion study and consequently labor control not only misconceives the scope of scientific management, but also misinterprets Taylor's incentives for proposing a different style of managerial thought.<ref>Nyland, C 1996, \u2018Taylorism, John R. Commons, and the Hoxie Report\u2019, Journal of Economic Issues, vol. 30, no. 4, pp. 985-1016</ref>\n\n== Direct time study procedure ==\nFollowing is the procedure developed by Mikell Groover for a direct time study:<ref>Groover, Mikell P. (2007). Work Systems and Methods, Measurement, and Management of Work, Pearson Education International</ref>\n# Define and document the standard method.\n# Divide the task into work elements.\n#: These first two steps are conducted prior to the actual timing. They familiarize the analyst with the task and allow the analyst to attempt to improve the work procedure before defining the standard time.\n# Time the work elements to obtain the observed time for the task.\n# Evaluate the worker's pace relative to standard performance (performance rating), to determine the normal time.\n#: Note that steps 3 and 4 are accomplished simultaneously.  During these steps, several different work cycles are timed, and each cycle performance is rated independently. Finally, the values collected at these steps are averaged to get the normalized time.\n# Apply an allowance to the normal time to compute the standard time. The allowance factors that are needed in the work are then added to compute the standard time for the task.\n\n== Conducting time studies ==\nAccording to good practice guidelines for production studies <ref>Magagnotti, N., Spinelli, R., 2012, Good practice guidelines for biomass production system, COST Action FP-0902, WG 2 Operations research and measurement methodologies, 50 pages, Italy, {{ISBN|978-88-901660-4-4}}, available on internet: http://forestenergy.org/observer:get_page/observer/action/details/itemid/113?PHPSESSID=5157c9d7f7bbbb319764c33e4a28112b&viewportheight=933&viewportwidth=1887</ref> a comprehensive time study consists of:\n# Study goal setting;\n# Experimental design;\n# Time data collection;\n# Data analysis;\n# Reporting.\nEasy analysis of working areas\n\nThe collection of time data can be done in several ways, depending on study goal and environmental conditions. Time and motion data can be captured with a common stopwatch, a handheld computer or a video recorder.  There are a number of dedicated software packages used to turn a palmtop or a handheld PC into a time study device. As an alternative, time and motion data can be collected automatically from the memory of computer-control machines (i.e. automated time studies).\n\n==Health care time and motion study==\nA '''Health care time and motion study''' is used to research and track the efficiency and quality of health care workers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lopetegui|first1=Marcelo|last2=Yen|first2=Po-Yin|last3=Lai|first3=Albert|last4=Jeffries|first4=Joseph|last5=Embi|first5=Peter|last6=Payne|first6=Philip|title=Time motion studies in healthcare: What are we talking about?|journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics|date=June 2014|volume=49|pages=292\u2013299|doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2014.02.017|pmc=4058370|pmid=24607863}}</ref>  In the case of nurses, numerous programs have been initiated to increase the percent of a shift nurses spend providing direct care to patients.

This method presents additional expense as it usually requires a 1 to 1 ratio of research time to subject time.  An advantage is the data can be more consistent, complete, and accurate than with [https://www.caretime.in self-reporting].\n*Self-reporting: Self-reported studies require the target to record time and activity data.  This can be done contemporaneously by having subjects stop and start a timer when completing a task, through work sampling where the subject records what they are doing at determined or random intervals, or by having the subject journal activities at the end of the day. Self-reporting introduces errors that may not be present through other methods, including errors in temporal perception and memory, as well as the motivation to manipulate the data.\n*Automation: Motion can be tracked with GPS.  Documentation activities can be tracked through monitoring software embedded in the applications used to create documentation.

They familiarize the analyst with the task and allow the analyst to attempt to improve the work procedure before defining the standard time.\n# Time the work elements to obtain the observed time for the task.\n# Evaluate the worker's pace relative to standard performance (performance rating), to determine the normal time.\n#: Note that steps 3 and 4 are accomplished simultaneously.  During these steps, several different work cycles are timed, and each cycle performance is rated independently. Finally, the values collected at these steps are averaged to get the normalized time.\n# Apply an allowance to the normal time to compute the standard time. The allowance factors that are needed in the work are then added to compute the standard time for the task.\n\n== Conducting time studies ==\nAccording to good practice guidelines for production studies <ref>Magagnotti, N., Spinelli, R., 2012, Good practice guidelines for biomass production system, COST Action FP-0902, WG 2 Operations research and measurement methodologies, 50 pages, Italy, {{ISBN|978-88-901660-4-4}}, available on internet: http://forestenergy.org/observer:get_page/observer/action/details/itemid/113?PHPSESSID=5157c9d7f7bbbb319764c33e4a28112b&viewportheight=933&viewportwidth=1887</ref> a comprehensive time study consists of:\n# Study goal setting;\n# Experimental design;\n# Time data collection;\n# Data analysis;\n# Reporting.\nEasy analysis of working areas\n\nThe collection of time data can be done in several ways, depending on study goal and environmental conditions. Time and motion data can be captured with a common stopwatch, a handheld computer or a video recorder.  There are a number of dedicated software packages used to turn a palmtop or a handheld PC into a time study device. As an alternative, time and motion data can be collected automatically from the memory of computer-control machines (i.e. automated time studies).\n\n==Health care time and motion study==\nA '''Health care time and motion study''' is used to research and track the efficiency and quality of health care workers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lopetegui|first1=Marcelo|last2=Yen|first2=Po-Yin|last3=Lai|first3=Albert|last4=Jeffries|first4=Joseph|last5=Embi|first5=Peter|last6=Payne|first6=Philip|title=Time motion studies in healthcare: What are we talking about?|journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics|date=June 2014|volume=49|pages=292\u2013299|doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2014.02.017|pmc=4058370|pmid=24607863}}</ref>  In the case of nurses, numerous programs have been initiated to increase the percent of a shift nurses spend providing direct care to patients. Prior to interventions nurses were found to spend ~20% of their time doing direct care.  After focused intervention, some hospitals doubled that number, with some even exceeding 70% of shift time with patients, resulting in reduced errors, codes, and falls.<ref>{{cite web|last1=RN|first1=Rachael Zimlich|title=Hospitals resolve to increase nurses\u2019 time at the bedside|url=http://healthcaretraveler.modernmedicine.com/healthcare-traveler/content/modernmedicine/modern-medicine-feature-articles/hospitals-resolve-increa|website=Healthcare Traveler|accessdate=2 June 2017|language=en|date=13 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hendrich|first1=Ann|title=A 36-Hospital Time and Motion Study: How Do Medical-Surgical Nurses Spend Their Time?|journal=The Permanente Journal|date=1 June 2008|pages=25\u201334|doi=10.7812/TPP/08-021|pmc=3037121|pmid=21331207|volume=12}}</ref>\n\n===Methods===\n*External observer: Someone visually follows the person being observed, either contemporaneously or via video recording.  This method presents additional expense as it usually requires a 1 to 1 ratio of research time to subject time.  An advantage is the data can be more consistent, complete, and accurate than with self-reporting.\n*Self-reporting: Self-reported studies require the target to record time and activity data.  This can be done contemporaneously by having subjects stop and start a timer when completing a task, through work sampling where the subject records what they are doing at determined or random intervals, or by having the subject journal activities at the end of the day. Self-reporting introduces errors that may not be present through other methods, including errors in temporal perception and memory, as well as the motivation to manipulate the data.\n*Automation: Motion can be tracked with GPS.  Documentation activities can be tracked through monitoring software embedded in the applications used to create documentation.  Badge scans can also create a log of activity.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [[Ergonomics]]\n* [[Human factors]]\n* [[Methods-time measurement]]\n* [[Memo motion]]\n* [[Predetermined motion time system]]\n* [[Standard time (manufacturing)|Standard time]]\n* [[Industrial Engineering]]\n* [[Evolutionary economics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{IE 7 Tools}}\n\n[[Category:Time and motion study| ]]\n[[Category:Economic efficiency]]\n[[Category:Industrial engineering]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "2405:204:3484:9e43::1e0e:b8ac", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Health tips)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_motion_study"}

Siddhi and Vinayak grew up together but a misunderstanding causes them to separate and they meet 14 years later. When Siddhi realises Vin is Vinayak, she lashes out at him for causing the accident that left her father paralysed back when they were kids. As Vin tries to apologise to Siddhi, they are attacked and Vin watches helplessly as Siddhi is caught in a fire. Vin thinks Siddhi was killed by his father Shankar. \n\n=== 1 year later ===\nSiddhi is forced to undergo a plastic surgery and with help from Dr. Pratima assumes the look and identity of Riddhi ([[Farnaz Shetty]]), her dead granddaughter. She gets a job as Vinayak's secretary to take revenge from him thinking he was responsible for the attack on her. In her absence, Vin has become distant from his father and has been taking care of Siddhi's family disguised as an NGO worker called Prateek. Siddhi's family have still been waiting for her. \n\nRiddhi gradually discovers that Vin has been innocent all along. Meanwhile, Vin's cousin Rajbeer and his wife Prachi (who is also Siddhi's sister) make several plans to kill Vin as does Vin's other brother Manbeer's wife, Gauri. Discovering his innocence, Riddhi saves Vin risking her own life and realises she has fallen in love. She also finds out that while Shankar had paid goons to kidnap Siddhi, someone else had set her on fire and attacked Vin. Vin's family's priest, Guru ji, warns them that his life is in danger and can be saved only if he is married to a woman who will protect him at all costs. Vin's mother Manjari convinces him to agree and his wedding is fixed to a woman named Vaibhavi. However, Riddhi exposes Vaibhavi and her mother Kanta to be frauds. Vin meets with an accident and to save him Riddhi marries him while he is unconscious with only Shankar, Manjari, Manbeer and Guru ji knowing about the wedding. Manjari is revealed to have been behind all the attacks on Vin and shown to be doing it to control the Kundra property. Vin falls in love with Riddhi not knowing she is Siddhi and is already married to him. \n\nShivam Sen comes to Kundra Mansion and convinces everyone that Siddhi is his wife Riddhi and mother of Juhi. Manjari supports Shivam. Vin finally finds out Riddhi is in fact his wife and is Siddhi. He tries to get her back but Siddhi is attacked. Manjari kidnaps Juhi and makes it look like Shivam is responsible. Vin comes to save Manjari and Juhi, but Manjari shoots Shivam and kills him. When police arrive, Vin takes the blame and goes to jail. Siddhi figures out Manjari is the murderer and is trying to kill her. Manjari sends a man named Kabir to kill Vin while he is in jail but Vin is able to escape. Siddhi eventually proves Vin's innocence in court and brings him home. \n\nWhile everyone in the Kundra family celebrate Vin's return, a man named Rudra enters the Kundra Mansion stating he is the long lost son of Shankar and Manjari. It is finally revealed that Shankar gave up Rudra after he was born to protect Vin as per a prophecy and that Manjari had been acting against Vin all along because Vin is her stepson while Rudra is her biological son. Rudra falls for Siddhi but gets married to a woman named Urvashi. At a festival, Siddhi saves Vin from being shot at by Rudra. However, someone shoots Rudra and he dies. Vin misunderstands Siddhi and marries a pregnant Urvashi.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Nitin Goswami]] as Vinayak \"Vin\" Kundra<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/nitin-goswami-i-only-want-to-play-the-male-lead-now/articleshow/70644400.cms|title=Nitin Goswami: I only want to play the male lead now - Times of India|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/tv/hindi/neha-saxena-and-nitin-goswami-talk-about-their-show-siddhivinayak-/videoshow/61211882.cms|title=Neha Saxena and Nitin Goswami talk about their show Siddhivinayak. {{!}} TV - Times of India Videos|website=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n* [[Neha Saxena (TV actress)|Neha Saxena]] as Siddhi Joshi (before plastic surgery)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/in-conversation-with-neha-saxena-on-fb-watch-now/articleshow/61115586.cms|title=In conversation with Neha Saxena on FB, watch now|accessdate=17 October 2017|publisher=Times Of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/tv/news/hindi/neha-saxena-to-make-a-comeback-with-a-fiction-show/articleshow/60956671.cms|title=Neha Saxena to make a comeback with a fiction show|accessdate=5 October 2017|publisher=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref>\n* [[Farnaz Shetty]] as Riddhi Sen, a woman whose face is given to Siddhi; later Siddhi (after plastic surgery)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizasialive.com/farnaz-shetty-replaces-neha-saxena-lead-siddhi-vinayak/|title=Farnaz Shetty replaces Neha Saxena as lead in 'Siddhi Vinayak'|last=Correspondent|first=BizAsia|date=2018-01-21|website=BizAsia {{!}} Media, Entertainment, Showbiz, Events and Music|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.easterneye.biz/farnaz-shetty-neha-saxena-siddhivinayak/|title=Farnaz Shetty in, Neha Saxena out of Siddhivinayak|last=Singh|first=Mohnish|date=2018-01-22|website=EasternEye|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref>\n* [[Roshni Rastogi]] as Urvashi Kundra, Vinayak's second wife\n* Utkarsha Naik as Manjari Kundra, Vinayak's stepmother\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Shardul Pandit]] as Shivam Sen, Riddhi\u2019s husband<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/shardul-pandit-to-make-his-theatre-debut/articleshow/66766069.cms|title=Shardul Pandit to make his theatre debut - Times of India|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n* Ayesha Vindhara as Juhi Sen, Shivam and Riddhi's daughter\n*[[Gaurav S Bajaj]] as Rudra Kundra, Manjari's long lost son, Vinayak's half brother\n*[[Manish Khanna]] as Shankar Kundra, Vinayak and Rudra's father\n*Karan Khandelwal as Rajbeer Kundra, Vinayak's cousin brother\n*Nishi Singh as Bijlee Kundra, Rajbeer's mother\n*[[Priyanka Bora]] as Prachi Joshi, Siddhi's sister and later Rajbeer's wife\n* Prithvi Sankala as Aniket Joshi, Siddhi and Prachi's father\n* Anjali Gupta as Savita Joshi, Siddhi and Prachi's mother\n*Amar Deep Garg as Guru ji\n* Farah Hussain as Zai, Siddhi's friend\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n''[http://www.ozee.com/shows/siddhivinayak Siddhi Vinayak]'' Streaming on OZEE\n\n{{&TV Programmes}}\n\n[[Category:2017 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:&TV television series]]\n[[Category:Indian drama television series]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language television programs]]\n[[Category:2010s Indian television series]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=October 2017}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name              = Siddhi Vinayak\n| image                  = Sidvin TV.jpg\n| caption                = \n| genre                  = [[Drama]]\n| creator                = Prashant Bhatt <br>Sanjay Memane\n| writer                 = Renu Watwani <br> Vishal Watwani <br> Salil Sand <br> Agam gaurav\n| director               = \n| starring               = [[Siddhi Vinayak#Cast|See below]]\n| opentheme              = \n| country                = India\n| language               = Hindi\n| num_seasons            = 2\n| num_episodes           = 320\n| producer               = Prashant Bhatt<br> Sanjay Memane\n| camera                 = [[Multi-camera setup|Multi-camera]]\n| runtime                = 22 minutes \n| company                = Studio B & M\n| picture_format         = [[576i]] <br> [[1080i]] ([[HDTV]])\n| first_aired            = {{Start date|df=yes|2017|10|26|}}\n| last_aired             = {{End date|df=yes|2019|1|18|}}\n| related =[[Pratidaan]]\n| channel                = [[ZEE5]]<br>[[&TV]] \n| website                = https://www.zee5.com/tvshows/details/siddhivinayak/0-6-677\n}}\n\n'''''Siddhi Vinayak''''' is an Indian romantic television series that aired from 26 October 2017 to 18 January 2019 on [[&TV]].

Siddhi and Vinayak grew up together but a misunderstanding causes them to separate and they meet 14 years later. When Siddhi realises Vin is Vinayak, she lashes out at him for causing the accident that left her father paralysed back when they were kids. As Vin tries to apologise to Siddhi, they are attacked and Vin watches helplessly as Siddhi is caught in a fire. Vin thinks Siddhi was killed by his father Shankar. \n\n=== 1 year later ===\nSiddhi is forced to undergo a plastic surgery and with help from Dr. Pratima assumes the look and identity of Riddhi ([[Farnaz Shetty]]), her dead granddaughter. She gets a job as Vinayak's secretary to take revenge from him thinking he was responsible for the attack on her. In her absence, Vin has become distant from his father and has been taking care of Siddhi's family disguised as an NGO worker called Prateek. Siddhi's family have still been waiting for her. \n\nRiddhi gradually discovers that Vin has been innocent all along. Meanwhile, Vin's cousin Rajbeer and his wife Prachi (who is also Siddhi's sister) make several plans to kill Vin as does Vin's other brother Manbeer's wife, Gauri. Discovering his innocence, Riddhi saves Vin risking her own life and realises she has fallen in love. She also finds out that while Shankar had paid goons to kidnap Siddhi, someone else had set her on fire and attacked Vin. Vin's family's priest, Guru ji, warns them that his life is in danger and can be saved only if he is married to a woman who will protect him at all costs. Vin's mother Manjari convinces him to agree and his wedding is fixed to a woman named Vaibhavi. However, Riddhi exposes Vaibhavi and her mother Kanta to be frauds. Vin meets with an accident and to save him Riddhi marries him while he is unconscious with only Shankar, Manjari, Manbeer and Guru ji knowing about the wedding. Manjari is revealed to have been behind all the attacks on Vin and shown to be doing it to control the Kundra property. Vin falls in love with Riddhi not knowing she is Siddhi and is already married to him. \n\nShivam Sen comes to Kundra Mansion and convinces everyone that Siddhi is his wife Riddhi and mother of Juhi. Manjari supports Shivam. Vin finally finds out Riddhi is in fact his wife and is Siddhi. He tries to get her back but Siddhi is attacked. Manjari kidnaps Juhi and makes it look like Shivam is responsible. Vin comes to save Manjari and Juhi, but Manjari shoots Shivam and kills him. When police arrive, Vin takes the blame and goes to jail. Siddhi figures out Manjari is the murderer and is trying to kill her. Manjari sends a man named Kabir to kill Vin while he is in jail but Vin is able to escape. Siddhi eventually proves Vin's innocence in court and brings him home. \n\nWhile everyone in the Kundra family celebrate Vin's return, a man named Rudra enters the Kundra Mansion stating he is the long lost son of Shankar and Manjari. It is finally revealed that Shankar gave up Rudra after he was born to protect Vin as per a prophecy and that Manjari had been acting against Vin all along because Vin is her stepson while Rudra is her biological son. Rudra falls for Siddhi but gets married to a woman named Urvashi. At a festival, Siddhi saves Vin from being shot at by Rudra. However, someone shoots Rudra and he dies. Vin misunderstands Siddhi and marries a pregnant Urvashi.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Nitin Goswami]] as Vinayak \"Vin\" Kundra<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/nitin-goswami-i-only-want-to-play-the-male-lead-now/articleshow/70644400.cms|title=Nitin Goswami: I only want to play the male lead now - Times of India|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/tv/hindi/neha-saxena-and-nitin-goswami-talk-about-their-show-siddhivinayak-/videoshow/61211882.cms|title=Neha Saxena and Nitin Goswami talk about their show Siddhivinayak. {{!}} TV - Times of India Videos|website=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n* [[Neha Saxena (TV actress)|Neha Saxena]] as Siddhi Joshi (before plastic surgery)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/in-conversation-with-neha-saxena-on-fb-watch-now/articleshow/61115586.cms|title=In conversation with Neha Saxena on FB, watch now|accessdate=17 October 2017|publisher=Times Of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/tv/news/hindi/neha-saxena-to-make-a-comeback-with-a-fiction-show/articleshow/60956671.cms|title=Neha Saxena to make a comeback with a fiction show|accessdate=5 October 2017|publisher=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref>\n* [[Farnaz Shetty]] as Riddhi Sen, a woman whose face is given to Siddhi; later Siddhi (after plastic surgery)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizasialive.com/farnaz-shetty-replaces-neha-saxena-lead-siddhi-vinayak/|title=Farnaz Shetty replaces Neha Saxena as lead in 'Siddhi Vinayak'|last=Correspondent|first=BizAsia|date=2018-01-21|website=BizAsia {{!}} Media, Entertainment, Showbiz, Events and Music|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.easterneye.biz/farnaz-shetty-neha-saxena-siddhivinayak/|title=Farnaz Shetty in, Neha Saxena out of Siddhivinayak|last=Singh|first=Mohnish|date=2018-01-22|website=EasternEye|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref>\n* [[Roshni Rastogi]] as Urvashi Kundra, Vinayak's second wife\n* Utkarsha Naik as Manjari Kundra, Vinayak's stepmother\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Shardul Pandit]] as Shivam Sen, Riddhi\u2019s husband<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/shardul-pandit-to-make-his-theatre-debut/articleshow/66766069.cms|title=Shardul Pandit to make his theatre debut - Times of India|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n* Ayesha Vindhara as Juhi Sen, Shivam and Riddhi's daughter\n*[[Gaurav S Bajaj]] as Rudra Kundra, Manjari's long lost son, Vinayak's half brother\n*[[Manish Khanna]] as Shankar Kundra, Vinayak and Rudra's father\n*Karan Khandelwal as Rajbeer Kundra, Vinayak's cousin brother\n*Nishi Singh as Bijlee Kundra, Rajbeer's mother\n*[[Priyanka Bora]] as Prachi Joshi, Siddhi's sister and later Rajbeer's wife\n* Prithvi Sankala as Aniket Joshi, Siddhi and Prachi's father\n* Anjali Gupta as Savita Joshi, Siddhi and Prachi's mother\n*Amar Deep Garg as Guru ji\n* Farah Hussain as Zai, Siddhi's friend\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n''[http://www.ozee.com/shows/siddhivinayak Siddhi Vinayak]'' Streaming on OZEE\n\n{{&TV Programmes}}\n\n[[Category:2017 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:&TV television series]]\n[[Category:Indian drama television series]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language television programs]]\n[[Category:2010s Indian television series]]\n", "name_user": "Santosh Shivkant bhatt", "label": "safe", "comment": "director name", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhi_Vinayak"}

Ions are also produced in the liquid or solid state when salts interact with solvents (for example, water) to produce ''solvated ions'', which are more stable, for reasons involving a combination of [[energy]] and [[entropy]] changes as the ions move away from each other to interact with the liquid.  These stabilized species are more commonly found in the environment at low temperatures. A common example is the ions present in seawater, which are derived from dissolved salts.\n\nAs charged objects, ions are attracted to opposite electric charges (positive to negative, and vice versa) and repelled by like charges. When they move, their trajectories can be deflected by a [[magnetic field]].\n\nElectrons, due to their smaller mass and thus larger space-filling properties as [[matter waves]], determine the size of atoms and molecules that possess any electrons at all. Thus, anions (negatively charged ions) are larger than the parent molecule or atom, as the excess electron(s) repel each other and add to the physical size of the ion, because its size is determined by its [[electron cloud]]. Cations are smaller than the corresponding parent atom or molecule due to the smaller size of the electron cloud. One particular cation (that of hydrogen) contains no electrons, and thus consists of a single proton - ''much smaller'' than the parent hydrogen atom.\n\n\n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# ''''===Anions \n# Andy guff as royalty cations===\n[[File:Ions.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|[[Hydrogen atom]] (center) contains a single [[proton]] and a single [[electron]].  Removal of the electron gives a cation (left), whereas addition of an electron gives an anion (right).  The hydrogen anion, with its loosely held two-electron cloud, has a larger radius than the neutral atom, which in turn is much larger than the bare proton of the [[cation]]. Hydrogen forms the only charge-+1 cation that has no electrons, but even cations that (unlike hydrogen) still retain one or more electrons are still smaller than the neutral atoms or molecules from which they are derived.]]\n{{redirect2|Cation|Anion|the particle physics/quantum computing concept|Anyon|other uses|Ion (disambiguation)}}\nSince the electric charge onvycfhdfxj the first full episode of the gaseous substances nitrogen the first full episode of the gaseous substances nitrogen the first full episode of the gaseous substances nitrogen the first full episode of the gaseous substances a proton is equal in magnitude to the charge on an electron, the net electric charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons.\n\nAn {{vanchor|anion}} (\u2212) ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6|n|,|a\u026a|.|\u0259n}}), from the Greek word \u1f04\u03bd\u03c9 (''\u00e1n\u014d''), meaning \"up\",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095414154 | title =Oxford Reference: OVERVIEW anion | author =''[[Oxford University Press]]'' | publisher =oxfordreference.com | date =2013 }}</ref> is an ion with more electrons than protons, giving it a net negative charge (since electrons are negatively charged and protons are positively charged).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ruby.colorado.edu/~smyth/G101-2.html | title =Atoms and Elements, Isotopes and Ions | author =''[[University of Colorado Boulder]]'' | publisher =colorado.edu | date =November 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA {{vanchor|cation}} (+) ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|t|,|a\u026a|.|\u0259n}}), from the Greek word \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9 (''k\u00e1to''), meaning \"down\",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095555447 | title =Oxford Reference: OVERVIEW cation | author =''[[Oxford University Press]]'' | publisher =oxfordreference.com | date =2013 }}</ref> is an ion with fewer electrons than protons, giving it a positive charge.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usouthal.edu/geology/haywick/GY111/111-4.pdf | title =Elemental Chemistry | author =Douglas W.

Atoms in their ionic state may have a different colour from neutral atoms, and thus light absorption by metal ions gives the colour of [[gemstone]]s. In both inorganic and organic chemistry (including biochemistry), the interaction of water and ions is extremely important; an example is energy that drives the breakdown of adenosine triphosphate ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]). The following sections describe contexts in which ions feature prominently; these are arranged in decreasing physical length-scale, from the astronomical to the microscopic.\n\n== Related technology ==\nIons can be non-chemically prepared using various [[ion source]]s, usually involving high [[voltage]] or temperature.  These are used in a multitude of devices such as [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometers]], [[optical emission spectrometer]]s, [[particle accelerators]], [[Ion implantation|ion implanters]], and [[Ion thruster|ion engines]].\n\nAs reactive charged particles, they are also used in [[Air ioniser|air purification]] by disrupting microbes, and in household items such as [[smoke detector]]s.\n\nAs signalling and metabolism in organisms are controlled by a precise ionic gradient across [[cell membrane|membranes]], the disruption of this gradient contributes to cell death.  This is a common mechanism exploited by natural and artificial [[biocides]], including the [[ion channels]] [[gramicidin]] and [[amphotericin]] (a [[fungicide]]).\n\nInorganic dissolved ions are a component of [[total dissolved solids]], a widely known indicator of [[water quality]].\n\n===Detection of ionizing radiation===\n[[File:Ion chamber operation.gif|thumb|right|300px|Schematic of an ion chamber, showing drift of ions. Electrons drift faster than positive ions due to their much smaller mass.<ref name = \"knoll\"/>]]\n[[File:Electron avalanche.gif|thumbnail|300px|Avalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionization event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionizing electron and the liberated electron.]]\nThe ionizing effect of radiation on a gas is extensively used for the detection of radiation such as [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]], [[gamma ray|gamma]] and [[X-rays]]. The original ionization event in these instruments results in the formation of an \"ion pair\"; a positive ion and a free electron, by ion impact by the radiation on the gas molecules. The [[ionization chamber]] is the simplest of these detectors, and collects all the charges created by ''direct ionization'' within the gas through the application of an electric field.<ref name = \"knoll\"/>\n\nThe [[Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube]] and the [[proportional counter]] both use a phenomenon known as a [[Townsend avalanche]] to multiply the effect of the original ionizing event by means of a cascade effect whereby the free electrons are given sufficient energy by the electric field to release further electrons by ion impact.\n\n==Chemistry==\n\n=== Denoting the charged state ===\n[[File:Ions notation.svg|thumb|right|Equivalent notations for an [[iron]] atom (Fe) that lost two electrons, referred to as [[ferrous]].]]\n\nWhen writing the [[chemical formula]] for an ion, its net charge is written in superscript immediately after the chemical structure for the molecule/atom.  The net charge is written with the magnitude ''before'' the sign; that is, a doubly charged cation is indicated as '''2+''' instead of '''+2'''.   However, the magnitude of the charge is omitted for singly charged molecules/atoms; for example, the [[sodium]] cation is indicated as Na<sup>+</sup> and ''not'' Na<sup>1+</sup>.\n\nAn alternative (and acceptable) way of showing a molecule/atom with multiple charges is by drawing out the signs multiple times, this is often seen with transition metals.  Chemists sometimes circle the sign; this is merely ornamental and does not alter the chemical meaning.  All three representations of {{chem|Fe|2+}} shown in the figure, are thus equivalent.\n\n[[File:Ions notation2.svg|thumb|Mixed Roman numerals and charge notations for the uranyl ion. The oxidation state of the metal is shown as superscripted Roman numerals, whereas the charge of the entire complex is shown by the angle symbol together with the magnitude and sign of the net charge.]]\n\nMonatomic ions are sometimes also denoted with Roman numerals; for example, the {{chem|Fe|2+}} example seen above is occasionally referred to as Fe(II) or Fe<sup>II</sup>.  The Roman numeral designates the ''formal [[oxidation state]]'' of an element, whereas the superscripted numerals denote the net charge.  The two notations are, therefore, exchangeable for monatomic ions, but the Roman numerals ''cannot'' be applied to polyatomic ions.  However, it is possible to mix the notations for the individual metal centre with a polyatomic complex, as shown by the uranyl ion example.\n\n=== Sub-classes ===\nIf an ion contains [[unpaired electron]]s, it is called a ''[[radical (chemistry)|radical]]'' ion. Just like uncharged radicals, radical ions are very reactive.  Polyatomic ions containing oxygen, such as carbonate and sulfate, are called ''[[oxyanion]]s''.   Molecular ions that contain at least one carbon to hydrogen bond are called ''organic ions''.  If the charge in an organic ion is formally centred on a carbon, it is termed a ''[[carbocation]]'' (if positively charged) or ''[[carbanion]]'' (if negatively charged).\n\n=== Formation ===\n==== Formation of monatomic ions ====\nMonatomic ions are formed by the gain or loss of electrons to the [[Valence electron|valence shell]] (the outer-most electron shell) in an atom. The inner shells of an atom are filled with electrons that are tightly bound to the positively charged [[atomic nucleus]], and so do not participate in this kind of chemical interaction. The process of gaining or losing electrons from a neutral atom or molecule is called ''ionization''.\n\nAtoms can be ionized by bombardment with [[radiation]], but the more usual process of ionization encountered in [[chemistry]] is the transfer of electrons between atoms or molecules. This transfer is usually driven by the attaining of stable (\"closed shell\") electronic configurations. Atoms will gain or lose electrons depending on which action takes the least energy.\n\nFor example, a [[sodium]] atom, Na, has a single electron in its valence shell, surrounding 2 stable, filled inner shells of 2 and 8 electrons. Since these filled shells are very stable, a sodium atom tends to lose its extra electron and attain this stable configuration, becoming a sodium cation in the process\n\n:Na \u2192 {{chem|Na|+}} + {{Subatomic particle|electron}}\n\nOn the other hand, a [[chlorine]] atom, Cl, has 7 electrons in its valence shell, which is one short of the stable, filled shell with 8 electrons. Thus, a chlorine atom tends to ''gain'' an extra electron and attain a stable 8-electron configuration, becoming a chloride anion in the process:\n\n:Cl + {{Subatomic particle|electron}} \u2192 {{chem|Cl|-}}\n\nThis driving force is what causes sodium and chlorine to undergo a chemical reaction, wherein the \"extra\" electron is transferred from sodium to chlorine, forming sodium cations and chloride anions. Being oppositely charged, these cations and anions form [[ionic bond]]s and combine to form [[sodium chloride]], NaCl, more commonly known as table salt.\n\n:{{chem|Na|+}} + {{chem|Cl|-}} \u2192 NaCl\n\n==== Formation of polyatomic and molecular ions ====\n[[File:Nitrate-ion-elpot.png|thumb|right|An [[electric potential|electrostatic potential]] map of the [[nitrate ion]] ({{chem|NO|3|\u2212}}). The 3-dimensional shell represents a single arbitrary [[isopotential]].]]\n\nPolyatomic and molecular ions are often formed by the gaining or losing of elemental ions such as a proton, {{chem|H|+}}, in neutral molecules. For example, when [[ammonia]], {{chem|NH|3}}, accepts a proton, {{chem|H|+}}\u2014a process called [[protonation]]\u2014it forms the [[ammonium]] ion, {{chem|NH|4|+}}. Ammonia and ammonium have the same number of electrons in essentially the same [[electron configuration|electronic configuration]], but ammonium has an extra proton that gives it a net positive charge.\n\nAmmonia can also lose an electron to gain a positive charge, forming the ion {{chem|NH|3|+}}. However, this ion is unstable, because it has an incomplete [[Valence electron|valence shell]] around the nitrogen atom, making it a very reactive [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] ion.\n\nDue to the instability of radical ions, polyatomic and molecular ions are usually formed by gaining or losing elemental ions such as {{chem|H|+}}, rather than gaining or losing electrons. This allows the molecule to preserve its stable electronic configuration while acquiring an electrical charge.\n\n==== Ionization potential ====\n{{main|Ionization potential}}\nThe [[energy]] required to detach an electron in its lowest energy state from an atom or molecule of a gas with less net electric charge is called the ''ionization potential'', or ''ionization energy''. The ''n''th ionization energy of an atom is the energy required to detach its ''n''th electron after the first ''n \u2212 1'' electrons have already been detached.\n\nEach successive ionization energy is markedly greater than the last. Particularly great increases occur after any given block of [[atomic orbital]]s is exhausted of electrons. For this reason, ions tend to form in ways that leave them with full orbital blocks. For example, sodium has one ''[[valence electron]]'' in its outermost shell, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one lost electron, as {{chem|Na|+}}. On the other side of the periodic table, chlorine has seven valence electrons, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one gained electron, as {{chem|Cl|-}}. Caesium has the lowest measured ionization energy of all the elements and helium has the greatest.<ref name=\"lenntech.com\">[http://www.lenntech.com/Periodic-chart-elements/ionization-energy.htm Chemical elements listed by ionization energy]. Lenntech.com</ref> In general, the ionization energy of [[metals]] is much lower than the ionization energy of [[nonmetals]], which is why, in general, metals will lose electrons to form positively charged ions and nonmetals will gain electrons to form negatively charged ions.\n\n===Ionic bonding===\n{{main|Ionic bond}}\n\n''Ionic bonding'' is a kind of [[chemical bond]]ing that arises from the mutual attraction of oppositely charged ions. Ions of like charge repel each other, and ions of opposite charge attract each other. Therefore, ions do not usually exist on their own, but will bind with ions of opposite charge to form a [[crystal lattice]]. The resulting compound is called an ''ionic compound'', and is said to be held together by ''ionic bonding''. In ionic compounds there arise characteristic distances between ion neighbours from which the spatial extension and the [[ionic radius]] of individual ions may be derived.\n\nThe most common type of ionic bonding is seen in compounds of metals and nonmetals (except [[noble gas]]es, which rarely form chemical compounds). Metals are characterized by having a small number of electrons in excess of a stable, closed-shell electronic configuration. As such, they have the tendency to lose these extra electrons in order to attain a stable configuration. This property is known as ''[[electropositivity]]''. Non-metals, on the other hand, are characterized by having an electron configuration just a few electrons short of a stable configuration. As such, they have the tendency to gain more electrons in order to achieve a stable configuration. This tendency is known as ''[[electronegativity]]''. When a highly electropositive metal is combined with a highly electronegative nonmetal, the extra electrons from the metal atoms are transferred to the electron-deficient nonmetal atoms. This reaction produces metal cations and nonmetal anions, which are attracted to each other to form a ''[[salt (chemistry)|salt]]''.\n\n===Common ions===\n{|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Common cations<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencegeek.net/Chemistry/chempdfs/CommonIons.pdf|title=Common Ions and Their Charges|website=Science Geek }}</ref>\n|-\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Common name\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Formula\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Historic name\n|-\n!

Ions are also produced in the liquid or solid state when salts interact with solvents (for example, water) to produce ''solvated ions'', which are more stable, for reasons involving a combination of [[energy]] and [[entropy]] changes as the ions move away from each other to interact with the liquid.  These stabilized species are more commonly found in the environment at low temperatures. A common example is the ions present in seawater, which are derived from dissolved salts.\n\nAs charged objects, ions are attracted to opposite electric charges (positive to negative, and vice versa) and repelled by like charges. When they move, their trajectories can be deflected by a [[magnetic field]].\n\nElectrons, due to their smaller mass and thus larger space-filling properties as [[matter waves]], determine the size of atoms and molecules that possess any electrons at all. Thus, anions (negatively charged ions) are larger than the parent molecule or atom, as the excess electron(s) repel each other and add to the physical size of the ion, because its size is determined by its [[electron cloud]]. Cations are smaller than the corresponding parent atom or molecule due to the smaller size of the electron cloud. One particular cation (that of hydrogen) contains no electrons, and thus consists of a single proton - ''much smaller'' than the parent hydrogen atom.\n\n===Anions and cations===\n[[File:Ions.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|[[Hydrogen atom]] (center) contains a single [[proton]] and a single [[electron]].  Removal of the electron gives a cation (left), whereas addition of an electron gives an anion (right).  The hydrogen anion, with its loosely held two-electron cloud, has a larger radius than the neutral atom, which in turn is much larger than the bare proton of the [[cation]]. Hydrogen forms the only charge-+1 cation that has no electrons, but even cations that (unlike hydrogen) still retain one or more electrons are still smaller than the neutral atoms or molecules from which they are derived.]]\n{{redirect2|Cation|Anion|the particle physics/quantum computing concept|Anyon|other uses|Ion (disambiguation)}}\nSince the electric charge on a proton is equal in magnitude to the charge on an electron, the net electric charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons.\n\nAn {{vanchor|anion}} (\u2212) ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6|n|,|a\u026a|.|\u0259n}}), from the Greek word \u1f04\u03bd\u03c9 (''\u00e1n\u014d''), meaning \"up\",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095414154 | title =Oxford Reference: OVERVIEW anion | author =''[[Oxford University Press]]'' | publisher =oxfordreference.com | date =2013 }}</ref> is an ion with more electrons than protons, giving it a net negative charge (since electrons are negatively charged and protons are positively charged).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ruby.colorado.edu/~smyth/G101-2.html | title =Atoms and Elements, Isotopes and Ions | author =''[[University of Colorado Boulder]]'' | publisher =colorado.edu | date =November 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA {{vanchor|cation}} (+) ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|t|,|a\u026a|.|\u0259n}}), from the Greek word \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9 (''k\u00e1to''), meaning \"down\",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095555447 | title =Oxford Reference: OVERVIEW cation | author =''[[Oxford University Press]]'' | publisher =oxfordreference.com | date =2013 }}</ref> is an ion with fewer electrons than protons, giving it a positive charge.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usouthal.edu/geology/haywick/GY111/111-4.pdf | title =Elemental Chemistry | author =Douglas W.

Atoms in their ionic state may have a different colour from neutral atoms, and thus light absorption by metal ions gives the colour of [[gemstone]]s. In both inorganic and organic chemistry (including biochemistry), the interaction of water and ions is extremely important; an example is energy that drives the breakdown of adenosine triphosphate ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]). The following sections describe contexts in which ions feature prominently; these are arranged in decreasing physical length-scale, from the astronomical to the microscopic.\n\n== Related technology ==\nIons can be non-chemically prepared using various [[ion source]]s, usually involving high [[voltage]] or temperature.  These are used in a multitude of devices such as [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometers]], [[optical emission spectrometer]]s, [[particle accelerators]], [[Ion implantation|ion implanters]], and [[Ion thruster|ion engines]].\n\nAs reactive charged particles, they are also used in [[Air ioniser|air purification]] by disrupting microbes, and in household items such as [[smoke detector]]s.\n\nAs signalling and metabolism in organisms are controlled by a precise ionic gradient across [[cell membrane|membranes]], the disruption of this gradient contributes to cell death.  This is a common mechanism exploited by natural and artificial [[biocides]], including the [[ion channels]] [[gramicidin]] and [[amphotericin]] (a [[fungicide]]).\n\nInorganic dissolved ions are a component of [[total dissolved solids]], a widely known indicator of [[water quality]].\n\n===Detection of ionizing radiation===\n[[File:Ion chamber operation.gif|thumb|right|300px|Schematic of an ion chamber, showing drift of ions. Electrons drift faster than positive ions due to their much smaller mass.<ref name = \"knoll\"/>]]\n[[File:Electron avalanche.gif|thumbnail|300px|Avalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionization event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionizing electron and the liberated electron.]]\nThe ionizing effect of radiation on a gas is extensively used for the detection of radiation such as [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]], [[gamma ray|gamma]] and [[X-rays]]. The original ionization event in these instruments results in the formation of an \"ion pair\"; a positive ion and a free electron, by ion impact by the radiation on the gas molecules. The [[ionization chamber]] is the simplest of these detectors, and collects all the charges created by ''direct ionization'' within the gas through the application of an electric field.<ref name = \"knoll\"/>\n\nThe [[Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube]] and the [[proportional counter]] both use a phenomenon known as a [[Townsend avalanche]] to multiply the effect of the original ionizing event by means of a cascade effect whereby the free electrons are given sufficient energy by the electric field to release further electrons by ion impact.\n\n==Chemistry==\n\n=== Denoting the charged state ===\n[[File:Ions notation.svg|thumb|right|Equivalent notations for an [[iron]] atom (Fe) that lost two electrons, referred to as [[ferrous]].]]\n\nWhen writing the [[chemical formula]] for an ion, its net charge is written in superscript immediately after the chemical structure for the molecule/atom.  The net charge is written with the magnitude ''before'' the sign; that is, a doubly charged cation is indicated as '''2+''' instead of '''+2'''.   However, the magnitude of the charge is omitted for singly charged molecules/atoms; for example, the [[sodium]] cation is indicated as Na<sup>+</sup> and ''not'' Na<sup>1+</sup>.\n\nAn alternative (and acceptable) way of showing a molecule/atom with multiple charges is by drawing out the signs multiple times, this is often seen with transition metals.  Chemists sometimes circle the sign; this is merely ornamental and does not alter the chemical meaning.  All three representations of {{chem|Fe|2+}} shown in the figure, are thus equivalent.\n\n[[File:Ions notation2.svg|thumb|Mixed Roman numerals and charge notations for the uranyl ion. The oxidation state of the metal is shown as superscripted Roman numerals, whereas the charge of the entire complex is shown by the angle symbol together with the magnitude and sign of the net charge.]]\n\nMonatomic ions are sometimes also denoted with Roman numerals; for example, the {{chem|Fe|2+}} example seen above is occasionally referred to as Fe(II) or Fe<sup>II</sup>.  The Roman numeral designates the ''formal [[oxidation state]]'' of an element, whereas the superscripted numerals denote the net charge.  The two notations are, therefore, exchangeable for monatomic ions, but the Roman numerals ''cannot'' be applied to polyatomic ions.  However, it is possible to mix the notations for the individual metal centre with a polyatomic complex, as shown by the uranyl ion example.\n\n=== Sub-classes ===\nIf an ion contains [[unpaired electron]]s, it is called a ''[[radical (chemistry)|radical]]'' ion. Just like uncharged radicals, radical ions are very reactive.  Polyatomic ions containing oxygen, such as carbonate and sulfate, are called ''[[oxyanion]]s''.   Molecular ions that contain at least one carbon to hydrogen bond are called ''organic ions''.  If the charge in an organic ion is formally centred on a carbon, it is termed a ''[[carbocation]]'' (if positively charged) or ''[[carbanion]]'' (if negatively charged).\n\n=== Formation ===\n==== Formation of monatomic ions ====\nMonatomic ions are formed by the gain or loss of electrons to the [[Valence electron|valence shell]] (the outer-most electron shell) in an atom. The inner shells of an atom are filled with electrons that are tightly bound to the positively charged [[atomic nucleus]], and so do not participate in this kind of chemical interaction. The process of gaining or losing electrons from a neutral atom or molecule is called ''ionization''.\n\nAtoms can be ionized by bombardment with [[radiation]], but the more usual process of ionization encountered in [[chemistry]] is the transfer of electrons between atoms or molecules. This transfer is usually driven by the attaining of stable (\"closed shell\") electronic configurations. Atoms will gain or lose electrons depending on which action takes the least energy.\n\nFor example, a [[sodium]] atom, Na, has a single electron in its valence shell, surrounding 2 stable, filled inner shells of 2 and 8 electrons. Since these filled shells are very stable, a sodium atom tends to lose its extra electron and attain this stable configuration, becoming a sodium cation in the process\n\n:Na \u2192 {{chem|Na|+}} + {{Subatomic particle|electron}}\n\nOn the other hand, a [[chlorine]] atom, Cl, has 7 electrons in its valence shell, which is one short of the stable, filled shell with 8 electrons. Thus, a chlorine atom tends to ''gain'' an extra electron and attain a stable 8-electron configuration, becoming a chloride anion in the process:\n\n:Cl + {{Subatomic particle|electron}} \u2192 {{chem|Cl|-}}\n\nThis driving force is what causes sodium and chlorine to undergo a chemical reaction, wherein the \"extra\" electron is transferred from sodium to chlorine, forming sodium cations and chloride anions. Being oppositely charged, these cations and anions form [[ionic bond]]s and combine to form [[sodium chloride]], NaCl, more commonly known as table salt.\n\n:{{chem|Na|+}} + {{chem|Cl|-}} \u2192 NaCl\n\n==== Formation of polyatomic and molecular ions ====\n[[File:Nitrate-ion-elpot.png|thumb|right|An [[electric potential|electrostatic potential]] map of the [[nitrate ion]] ({{chem|NO|3|\u2212}}). The 3-dimensional shell represents a single arbitrary [[isopotential]].]]\n\nPolyatomic and molecular ions are often formed by the gaining or losing of elemental ions such as a proton, {{chem|H|+}}, in neutral molecules. For example, when [[ammonia]], {{chem|NH|3}}, accepts a proton, {{chem|H|+}}\u2014a process called [[protonation]]\u2014it forms the [[ammonium]] ion, {{chem|NH|4|+}}. Ammonia and ammonium have the same number of electrons in essentially the same [[electron configuration|electronic configuration]], but ammonium has an extra proton that gives it a net positive charge.\n\nAmmonia can also lose an electron to gain a positive charge, forming the ion {{chem|NH|3|+}}. However, this ion is unstable, because it has an incomplete [[Valence electron|valence shell]] around the nitrogen atom, making it a very reactive [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] ion.\n\nDue to the instability of radical ions, polyatomic and molecular ions are usually formed by gaining or losing elemental ions such as {{chem|H|+}}, rather than gaining or losing electrons. This allows the molecule to preserve its stable electronic configuration while acquiring an electrical charge.\n\n==== Ionization potential ====\n{{main|Ionization potential}}\nThe [[energy]] required to detach an electron in its lowest energy state from an atom or molecule of a gas with less net electric charge is called the ''ionization potential'', or ''ionization energy''. The ''n''th ionization energy of an atom is the energy required to detach its ''n''th electron after the first ''n \u2212 1'' electrons have already been detached.\n\nEach successive ionization energy is markedly greater than the last. Particularly great increases occur after any given block of [[atomic orbital]]s is exhausted of electrons. For this reason, ions tend to form in ways that leave them with full orbital blocks. For example, sodium has one ''[[valence electron]]'' in its outermost shell, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one lost electron, as {{chem|Na|+}}. On the other side of the periodic table, chlorine has seven valence electrons, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one gained electron, as {{chem|Cl|-}}. Caesium has the lowest measured ionization energy of all the elements and helium has the greatest.<ref name=\"lenntech.com\">[http://www.lenntech.com/Periodic-chart-elements/ionization-energy.htm Chemical elements listed by ionization energy]. Lenntech.com</ref> In general, the ionization energy of [[metals]] is much lower than the ionization energy of [[nonmetals]], which is why, in general, metals will lose electrons to form positively charged ions and nonmetals will gain electrons to form negatively charged ions.\n\n===Ionic bonding===\n{{main|Ionic bond}}\n\n''Ionic bonding'' is a kind of [[chemical bond]]ing that arises from the mutual attraction of oppositely charged ions. Ions of like charge repel each other, and ions of opposite charge attract each other. Therefore, ions do not usually exist on their own, but will bind with ions of opposite charge to form a [[crystal lattice]]. The resulting compound is called an ''ionic compound'', and is said to be held together by ''ionic bonding''. In ionic compounds there arise characteristic distances between ion neighbours from which the spatial extension and the [[ionic radius]] of individual ions may be derived.\n\nThe most common type of ionic bonding is seen in compounds of metals and nonmetals (except [[noble gas]]es, which rarely form chemical compounds). Metals are characterized by having a small number of electrons in excess of a stable, closed-shell electronic configuration. As such, they have the tendency to lose these extra electrons in order to attain a stable configuration. This property is known as ''[[electropositivity]]''. Non-metals, on the other hand, are characterized by having an electron configuration just a few electrons short of a stable configuration. As such, they have the tendency to gain more electrons in order to achieve a stable configuration. This tendency is known as ''[[electronegativity]]''. When a highly electropositive metal is combined with a highly electronegative nonmetal, the extra electrons from the metal atoms are transferred to the electron-deficient nonmetal atoms. This reaction produces metal cations and nonmetal anions, which are attracted to each other to form a ''[[salt (chemistry)|salt]]''.\n\n===Common ions===\n{|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Common cations<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencegeek.net/Chemistry/chempdfs/CommonIons.pdf|title=Common Ions and Their Charges|website=Science Geek }}</ref>\n|-\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Common name\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Formula\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Historic name\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:aliceblue;\"|''Simple cations''\n|-\n|[[Aluminium]]||Al<sup>3+</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Barium]]||Ba<sup>2+</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Beryllium]]||Be<sup>2+</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Calcium]]||Ca<sup>2+</sup>||\n|-\n|Chromium(III)||Cr<sup>3+</sup>||\n|-\n|Copper(I)||Cu<sup>+</sup>||cuprous\n|-\n|Copper(II)||Cu<sup>2+</sup>||cupric\n|-\n|[[Hydrogen]]||H<sup>+</sup>||\n|-\n|Iron(II)||Fe<sup>2+</sup>||ferrous\n|-\n|Iron(III)||Fe<sup>3+</sup>||ferric\n|-\n|Lead(II)||Pb<sup>2+</sup>||plumbous\n|-\n|Lead(IV)||Pb<sup>4+</sup>||plumbic\n|-\n|[[Lithium]]||Li<sup>+</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Magnesium]]||Mg<sup>2+</sup>||\n|-\n|Manganese(II)||Mn<sup>2+</sup>||manganous\n|-\n|Manganese(III)||Mn<sup>3+</sup>||manganic\n|-\n|Manganese(IV)||Mn<sup>4+</sup>||\n|-\n|Mercury(II)||Hg<sup>2+</sup>||mercuric\n|-\n|[[Potassium]] ||K<sup>+</sup>||kalium <!-- The noun \"kalium\" is used more commonly than the adjective \"kalic\".-->\n|-\n|[[Silver]]||Ag<sup>+</sup>||argentous\n|-\n|[[Sodium]]||Na<sup>+</sup>||natric <!-- The noun \"natrium\" is used more commonly than the adjective \"natric\".-->\n|-\n|[[Strontium]]||Sr<sup>2+</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Tin]](II)||Sn<sup>2+</sup>||stannous\n|-\n|Tin(IV)||Sn<sup>4+</sup>||stannic\n|-\n|[[Zinc]]||Zn<sup>2+</sup>||\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:aliceblue;\"|''Polyatomic cations''\n|-\n|[[Ammonium]]||{{chem|NH|4|+}}||\n|-\n|[[Hydronium]]||H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>||\n|-\n|Mercury(I)||{{chem|Hg|2|2+}}||mercurous\n|}\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Common anions<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Formal name\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Formula\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Alt. name\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:aliceblue;\"|''Simple anions''\n|-\n|[[Azide]]||{{chem|N|3|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Bromide]]||Br<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Chloride]]||Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Fluoride]]||F<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Hydride]]||H<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Iodide]]||I<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Nitride]]||N<sup>3\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Phosphide]]||P<sup>3\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Oxide]]||O<sup>2\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Sulfide]]||S<sup>2\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[selenide]]||Se<sup>2\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:aliceblue;\"|''Oxoanions ([[Polyatomic ion]]s)<ref name=\":0\" />''\n|-\n|[[Carbonate]]||{{chem|CO|3|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Chlorate]]||{{chem|ClO|3|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Chromate ion|Chromate]]||{{chem|CrO|4|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Dichromate]]||{{chem|Cr|2|O|7|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|Dihydrogen phosphate||{{chem|H|2|PO|4|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Hydrogen carbonate]]||{{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}}||bicarbonate\n|-\n|[[Hydrogen sulfate]]||{{chem|HSO|4|\u2212}}||bisulfate\n|-\n|[[Hydrogen sulfite]]||{{chem|HSO|3|\u2212}}||bisulfite\n|-\n|[[Hydroxide]]||OH<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Hypochlorite]]||ClO<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|Monohydrogen phosphate||{{chem|HPO|4|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Nitrate]]||{{chem|NO|3|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Nitrite]]||{{chem|NO|2|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Perchlorate]]||{{chem|ClO|4|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Permanganate]]||{{chem|MnO|4|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Peroxide]]||{{chem|O|2|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Phosphate]]||{{chem|PO|4|3\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Sulfate]]||{{chem|SO|4|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Sulfite]]||{{chem|SO|3|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Superoxide]]||{{chem|O|2|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Thiosulfate]]||{{chem|S|2|O|3|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Silicate]]||{{chem|SiO|4|4\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Metasilicate (disambiguation)|Metasilicate]]||{{chem|SiO|3|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Aluminium silicate]]||{{chem|AlSiO|4|\u2212}}||\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:aliceblue;\"|''Anions from organic acids''\n|-\n|[[Acetate]]||{{chem|CH|3|COO|\u2212}}||ethanoate\n|-\n|[[Formate]]||{{chem|HCOO|\u2212}}||methanoate\n|-\n|[[Oxalate]]||{{chem|C|2|O|4|2\u2212}}||ethanedioate\n|-\n|[[Cyanide]]||CN<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|}\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Air ionizer]]\n* [[Aurora]]\n* [[Electrolyte]]\n* [[Gaseous ionization detectors]]\n* [[Ioliomics]]\n* [[Ion beam]]\n* [[Ion exchange]]\n* [[Ionizing radiation]]\n* [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|Stopping power of radiation particles]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Branches of chemistry}}\n{{Galvanic cells|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ions| ]]\n[[Category:Physical chemistry]]\n[[Category:Charge carriers]]\n", "name_user": "119.30.35.30", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eAnions and cations:Added links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"}

Chicago's most well known work is ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', which is permanently installed in the [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum]].

Her father came from a twenty-three generation lineage of [[rabbi]]s, including the [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] [[Vilna Gaon]]. Unlike his family predecessors, Arthur became a [[labor organization|labor organizer]] and a [[Marxist]].<ref name=\"F279\"/> He worked nights at a post office and took care of Chicago during the day, while May, who was a former dancer, worked as a [[medical secretary]].<ref name=\"A305\"/><ref name=\"F279\"/> Arthur's active participation in the [[American Communist Party]], liberal views towards women and support of workers' rights strongly influenced Chicago's ways of thinking and belief.<ref name=\"A306\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 306</ref> During the [[McCarthyism]] era in the 1950s, Arthur was investigated, which made it difficult for him to find work and caused the family much turmoil.<ref name=\"F279\"/> In 1945, while Chicago was alone at home with her infant brother, Ben, an [[FBI]] agent visited their house. The agent began to ask the six-year-old Chicago questions about her father and his friends, but the agent was interrupted upon the return of May to the house.<ref name=\"A306\"/> Arthur's health declined and he died in 1953 from [[peritonitis]]. May would not discuss his death with her children and did not allow them to attend the funeral. Chicago did not come to terms with his death until she was an adult; in the early 1960s she was hospitalized for almost a month with a bleeding ulcer attributed to unresolved [[grief]].<ref name=\"F279\">Felder and Rosen, 279.</ref>\n\nMay loved the arts, and instilled her passion for them in her children, as evident in Chicago's future as an artist, and brother Ben's eventual career as a [[pottery|potter]]. At age of three, Chicago began to draw and was sent to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] to attend classes.<ref name=\"F279\"/><ref name=\"W5\">Wydler and Lippard, 5.</ref> By the age of 5, Chicago knew that she \"never wanted to do anything but make art\"<ref name=\"W5\"/> and started attending classes at the Art Institute of Chicago.<ref name=\"The Guardian\" />  She applied but was denied admission to the Art Institute,<ref name=\"A306\"/> and instead attended [[UCLA]] on a scholarship.<ref name=\"F279\"/>\n\n==Education and early career==\n\nWhile at UCLA, she became politically active, designing posters for the UCLA [[NAACP]] chapter and eventually became its corresponding secretary.<ref name=\"A306\"/> In June 1959, she met and became romantically linked with Jerry Gerowitz. She left school and moved in with him, for the first time having her own studio space. The couple [[hitch hike]]d to New York in 1959, just as Chicago's mother and brother moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her.<ref name=\"A308\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 308</ref> The couple lived in [[Greenwich Village]] for a time, before returning in 1960 from Los Angeles to Chicago so she could finish her degree. Chicago married Gerowitz in 1961.<ref name=\"A311\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 311</ref> She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in 1962 and was a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]. Gerowitz died in a car crash in 1963, which devastated and caused Chicago to suffer from an [[identity crisis]] until later that decade. She received her [[Master of Fine Arts]] from UCLA in 1964.<ref name=\"F279\"/>\n\nWhile in grad school, Chicago's created a series that was [[abstract art|abstract]], yet easily recognized as male and female [[sexual organs]]. These early works were called ''Bigamy,'' and represented the death of her husband. One depicted an abstract [[human penis|penis]], which was \"stopped in flight\" before it could unite with a [[vagina|vaginal form]]. Her professors, who were mainly men, were dismayed over these works.<ref name=\"A311\"/> Despite the use of sexual organs in her work, Chicago refrained from using gender politics or identity as themes.\n\nIn 1965, Chicago displayed work in her first solo show, at the Rolf Nelson Gallery in Los Angeles; Chicago was one of only four female artists to take part in the show.<ref name=\"Illustrated Career History\">{{cite web|last=Chicago|first=Judy|title=Illustrated Career History|url=http://www.judychicago.com/about/career-history.php|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227074456/http://www.judychicago.com/about/career-history.php|archivedate=2014-02-27}}</ref> In 1968, Chicago was asked why she did not participate in the \"California Women in the Arts\" exhibition at the [[Lytton Center]], to which she answered, \"I won't show in any group defined as Woman, Jewish, or California. Someday when we all grow up there will be no labels.\" Chicago began working in [[ice sculpture]], which represented \"a metaphor for the preciousness of life,\" another reference towards her husband's death.<ref name=\"A314\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 314</ref>\n[[File:Pasadenalifesaversstudy.jpg|thumb|right|''Study for Pasadena Lifesavers,'' prismacolor, 1968.]]\n\nIn 1969, the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] exhibited a series of Chicago's spherical acrylic plastic dome sculptures and drawings in an \"experimental\" gallery. ''[[Art in America]]'' noted that Chicago's work was at the forefront of the [[conceptual art]] movement, and the ''Los Angeles Times'' described the work as showing no signs of \"theoretical New York type art.\"<ref name=\"A314\"/> Chicago would describe her early artwork as [[minimalist]] and as her trying to be \"one of the boys.\"<ref name=\"L455\">Lewis and Lewis, 455.</ref> Chicago would also experiment with [[performance art]], using [[fireworks]] and [[pyrotechnics]] to create \"atmospheres,\" which involved flashes of colored smoke being manipulated outdoors. Through this work she attempted to \"feminize\" and \"soften\" the landscape.<ref name=\"A315\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 315</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Chicago also began exploring her own sexuality in her work. She created the ''Pasadena Lifesavers,'' which was a series of abstract paintings that placed [[acrylic paint]] on [[Plexiglas]]. The works blended colors to create an illusion that the shapes \"turn, dissolve, open, close, vibrate, gesture, wiggle,\" representing her own discovery that \"I was [[orgasm|multi-orgasmic]].\" Chicago credited ''Pasadena Lifesavers,'' as being the major turning point in her work in relation to women's sexuality and representation.<ref name=\"A315\"/>\n\n===From Cohen to Gerowitz to Chicago: Name change===\n\nAs Chicago made a name for herself as an artist and came to know herself as a woman, she no longer felt connected to her last name, Cohen. This was due to the late grief of the death of her father and the lost connection to her name through marriage, Judith Gerowitz, after her husband's death. She decided to change her last name to something independent of being connected to a man by marriage or heritage.<ref name=\"F279\"/> In 1965, she married sculptor [[Lloyd Hamrol]]. (They divorced in 1979.)<ref name=\"F280\">Felder and Rosen, 280.</ref> Gallery owner [[Rolf Nelson]] nicknamed her \"Judy Chicago\"<ref name=\"F279\"/> because of her strong personality and thick [[Chicago accent]]. She decided this would be her new name. In legally changing her surname from the ethnically charged Gerowitz to the ethnically neutral Chicago, she freed herself from a certain social identity.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Jewish Identity in Modern Art History|last=Soussloff|first=Catherine|publisher=U of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=}}</ref> Chicago was appalled that her new husband's signature was required to change her name legally.<ref name=\"F280\"/> To celebrate the name change, she posed for the exhibition invitation dressed like a [[boxer]], wearing a [[sweatshirt]] with her new last name on it.<ref name=\"A315\"/> She also posted a banner across the gallery at her 1970 solo show at [[California State University, Fullerton|California State University at Fullerton]], that read: \"Judy Gerowitz hereby divests herself of all names imposed upon her through male social dominance and chooses her own name, Judy Chicago.\"<ref name=\"F280\"/> An advertisement with the same statement was also placed in ''[[Artforum]]'s'' October 1970 issue.<ref name=Levin2007p139>[[#SrcLevin2007|Levin, ''Becoming Judy Chicago; A Biography of the Artist'', p. 139]]</ref>\n\n==Artistic career==\n\n===The feminist art movement and the 1970s===\nIn 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at [[Fresno State College]], hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work.<ref name=\"A317\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 317</ref> At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape \"the presence and hence, the expectations of men.\"<ref name=\"A318\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 318</ref> She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the [[Feminist Art Program]], a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, [[Vanalyne Green]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], Cay Lang, [[Karen LeCocq]], Jan Lester, [[Chris Rush]], Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, [[Faith Wilding]], Shawnee Wollenman, [[Nancy Youdelman]], and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed $25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Institutional time : a critique of studio art education|last=1939\u2013|first=Chicago, Judy|isbn=9781580933667|oclc=851420315|year = 2014}}</ref> Later, Judy Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]] reestablished the [[Feminist Art Program]] at [[California Institute of the Arts]]. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by [[Joyce Aiken]] in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.{{refn|Aiken opened the all-women's [[co-op]] [[Gallery 25]] with her students, developed the Fresno Art Museum's Council of 100 and the Distinguished Women Artist Series, which helped develop programming and exhibitions about women at the museum.<ref name=\"Fresno1\">{{cite web |author1=Dr. Laura Meyer |author2=Nancy Youdelman | year= | title=A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Art Experiment | work=A Studio of their Own | publisher= | url=http://www.astudiooftheirown.org/legacy.html | accessdate=8 January 2011}}</ref>|group=nb}}\n\nChicago is considered one of the \"first-generation feminist artists,\" a group that also includes [[Mary Beth Edelson]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], and [[Rachel Rosenthal]].

These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the \"feminine.\" Chicago was strongly influenced by [[Gerda Lerner]], whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of [[women's history]] would continue to struggle independently and collectively.<ref name=\"F280\"/>\n\n===Womanhouse===\n{{main|Womanhouse}}\nWomanhouse was a project that involved Judy Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]]. It began in the fall of 1971 and was the first public exhibition of Feminist Art. They wanted to start the year with a large scale collaborative project that involved woman artists who spent much of their time talking about their problems as women. They used those problems as fuel and dealt with them while working on the project. Judy thought that female students often approach art-making with an unwillingness to push their limits due to their lack of familiarity with tools and processes, and an inability to see themselves as working people. In this environment, female artists experimented with women's conventional roles and experiences and how these could be displayed. \"The aim of the Feminist Art Program is to help women restructure their personalities to be more consistent with their desires to be artists and to help them build their art-making out of their experiences as women.\"<ref name=Schapiro>{{cite web|last1=Schapiro|first1=Miriam|last2=Chicago|first2=Judy|title=Womanhouse catalog essay|url=http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|publisher=Womanhouse|accessdate=7 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611044304/http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|archive-date=11 June 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Womanhouse is a \"true\" dramatic representation of woman's experience beginning in childhood, encompassing the struggles at home, with housework, menstruation, marriage, etc.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1975, Chicago's first book, ''Through the Flower'', was published; it \"chronicled her struggles to find her own identity as a woman artist.\"<ref name=\"Illustrated Career History\" />\n\n===''The Dinner Party''===\n[[File:Judy Chicago The Dinner Party.JPG|thumb|right|''[[File:Judy Chicago The Dinner Party.jpg|thumb]] [[The Dinner Party]]'' as installed at the [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]\n{{Main|The Dinner Party}}\n\nChicago decided to take Lerner's lesson to heart and took action to teach women about ''their'' history.

The project came into fruition with the assistance of over 400 people, mainly women, who volunteered to assist in [[needlework]], creating sculptures and other aspects of the process.<ref name=\"F281\">Felder and Rosen, 281.</ref>  When ''The Dinner Party'' was first constructed, it was a traveling exhibition. Through the Flower, her non-profit organization, was originally created to cover the expense of the creation and travel of the artwork. [[Jan Gerhard Lassen|Jane Gerhard]] dedicated a book to Judy Chicago and ''The Dinner Party'', entitled \"The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and The Power of Popular Feminism, 1970\u20132007.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.throughtheflower.org|title=Through the Flower and Judy Chicago|website=www.throughtheflower.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref>\n\nInspiration for The Dinner Party came from personal experience where Chicago found herself at a male dominated event. This event included highly educated men and women, however the men dominated the conversation and essence of the space. Chicago highlights important women that are often overlooked, giving credit to those who have stepped up for women's rights. This work is less of a statement and more of an honoring and a form of gratitude and inspiration. Chicago wanted the piece to teach about the struggle for power and equality women have endured in a male dominant societies. It considers the possibility of a meeting between powerful women and how this could change human history.\n\nMany art critics, including [[Hilton Kramer]] from The New York Times, were unimpressed by her work.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/insider/judy-chicago-dinner-part-art-reviews-times.html | title=From 'Vicious' to Celebratory: The Times's Reviews of Judy Chicago's 'The Dinner Party'| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2018-02-28| last1=Pilat| first1=Kasia}}</ref> Mr. Kramer felt Chicago's intended vision was not conveyed through this piece and \"it looked like an outrageous libel on the female imagination.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Although art critics felt her work lacked depth and the dinner party was just \"vaginas on plates,\" it was popular and captivated the general public. Chicago debuted her work in six countries on three continents. She reached over a million people through her artwork. Her work might not have pleased critics but its feminist message captivated the public and it honored the its featured 39 historical figures and 999 other women.\n\n===''Birth Project'' and ''PowerPlay''===\n\nFrom 1980 until 1985, Chicago created ''Birth Project''. It took five years to create. The piece used images of [[childbirth]] to celebrate woman's role as mother. Chicago was inspired to create this collective work because of the lack of imagery and representation of birth in the art world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/08/style/judy-chicago-women-s-lives-and-art.html|title=JUDY CHICAGO: WOMEN'S LIVES AND ART|last=Bennetts|first=Leslie|date=1985-04-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-11|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The installation reinterpreted the [[Genesis creation narrative]], which focused on the idea that a male [[god]] created a male human, [[Adam]], without the involvement of a woman.<ref name=\"F281\"/> Chicago described the piece as revealing a \"primordial female self hidden among the recesses of my soul...the birthing woman is part of the dawn of creation.\"<ref name=\"W5\"/> 150 needleworkers from the United States, [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] assisted in the project, working on 100 panels, by [[quilting]], [[macrame]], [[embroidery]] and other techniques. The size of the piece means it is rarely displayed in its entirety. The majority of the pieces from ''Birth Project'' are held in the collection of the [[Albuquerque Museum]].<ref name=\"F281\"/>\n\nChicago was not personally interested in motherhood. While she admired the women who chose this path, she did not find it right for herself. As recently as 2012, she said, \"There was no way on this earth I could have had children and the career I've had.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\">{{cite news|last=Cooke|first=Rachel|title=The art of Judy Chicago|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/04/judy-chicago-art-feminism-britain|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Birth Project'', Chicago returned to independent studio work. She created ''PowerPlay,'' a series of drawings, [[weaving]]s, paintings, [[cast paper]] and bronze [[reliefs]]. Through the series, Chicago replaced the male [[gaze]] with a feminist one, exploring the construct of masculinity and how power has affected men.<ref name=\"JVL\">{{cite web | author= | year=2012 | title=Judy Chicago | website= | publisher=Jewish Virtual Library | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/jchicago.html | accessdate=15 Jan 2011}}</ref>\n\n===A new kind of collaboration and ''The Holocaust Project''===\n\nIn the mid-1980s Chicago's interests \"shifted beyond 'issues of female identity' to an exploration of masculine power and powerlessness in the context of the Holocaust.\"<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\">{{cite journal | title=Judy Chicago in the UK | author=Galit Mana | journal=[[Jewish Renaissance]] |date=October 2012 | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=42\u201343}}</ref> Chicago's ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' (1985\u201393)<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\"/> is a collaboration with her husband, photographer [[Donald Woodman]], whom she married on [[New Year's Eve]] 1985. Although Chicago's previous husbands were both [[Jewish]], it wasn't until she met Woodman that she began to explore her own Jewish heritage.  Chicago met poet Harvey Mudd, who had written an [[epic poem]] about the [[Holocaust]]. Chicago was interested in illustrating the poem, but decided to create her own work instead, using her own art, visual and written. Chicago worked alongside her husband to complete the piece, which took eight years to finish.<ref name=\"F281\"/> The piece, which documents victims of the Holocaust, was created during a time of personal loss in Chicago's life: the death of her brother Ben, from [[Lou Gehrig's disease]], and the death of her mother from [[cancer]].<ref name=\"F282\">Felder and Rosen, 282.</ref>\n\nChicago used the tragic event of the Holocaust as a prism through which to explore victimization, oppression, injustice, and human cruelty.<ref name=\":1\" /> To seek inspiration for the project, Chicago and Woodman watched the documentary ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', which comprises interviews with Holocaust survivors at  [[Nazi concentration camps]] and other relevant Holocaust sites.<ref name=\"F282\"/> They also explored photo archives and written pieces about the Holocaust.<ref name=\"W6\"/> They spent several months touring concentration camps and visited [[Israel]].<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\"/> Chicago brought other issues into the work, such as [[environmentalism]], [[Native American genocide]],<ref name=\"W5\"/> and the [[Vietnam War]]. With these subjects Chicago sought to relate contemporary issues to the moral dilemma behind the Holocaust.<ref name=\"F282\"/> This aspect of the work caused controversy within the Jewish community, due to the comparison of the Holocaust to these other historical and contemporary concerns.<ref name=\"W5\"/> ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' consists of sixteen large scale works made of a variety of mediums including: [[tapestry]], [[stained glass]], metal work, wood work, photography, painting, and the [[sewing]] of [[Audrey Cowan]]. The exhibit ends with a piece that displays a Jewish couple at [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. The piece comprises 3000 square feet, providing a full exhibition experience for the viewer.<ref name=\"F282\"/> ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' was exhibited for the first time in October 1993 at the [[Spertus Museum]] in Chicago.<ref name=\"F282\"/> Most of the work from the piece is held at the [[Holocaust Center (Pittsburgh)|Holocaust Center]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"F284\">Felder and Rosen, 284.</ref>\n\nOver the next six years, Chicago created works that explored the experiences of concentration camp victims.<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\"/> Galit Mana of ''Jewish Renaissance'' magazine notes, \"This shift in focus led Chicago to work on other projects with an emphasis on Jewish tradition\", including ''Voices from the Song of Songs'' (1997), where Chicago \"introduces feminism and female sexuality into her representation of strong biblical female characters.\"<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\"/>\n\n===Current work and life===\n\nIn 1985, Chicago was remarried, to photographer [[Donald Woodman]]. To celebrate the couple's 25th wedding anniversary, Chicago created a \"Renewal Ketubah\" in 2010.<ref name=\"Illustrated Career History\" />\n\nIn 1994, Judy Chicago started \"Resolutions: A Stitch in Time\" which took 6 years to complete.

[[Damien Hirst]]'s dots sold, so he made thousands of dots. I would, like, never do that! It wouldn't even occur to me.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\" /> Chicago's subject matter, however, has broadened from the focus of ''The Dinner Party''. In the words of the artist: \"I guess you could say that my eyes were lifted from my vagina.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\" />\n\nChicago has permanent collections in numerous museums around the world. Those include, [[The British Museum]], [[The Brooklyn Museum]], The [[Getty Trust]], The [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], [[New Mexico Museum of Art]], [[The National Gallery of Art]], [[The National Museum of Women in the Arts]], The [[Penn Academy of the Fine Arts]], and The [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artstor.org/content/judy-chicago|title=Judy Chicago {{!}} Artstor|website=www.artstor.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref>\n\nIn her interview with [[Gloria Steinem]], Chicago spoke of her \"goal as an artist\", stating that it \"\u2026has been to create images in which the female experience is the path to the universal, as opposed to learning everything through the male gaze.\"<ref>\"Judy Chicago\" by Gloria Steinem, December/January 2018 issue of \"Interview\", pp. 28\u201331</ref>\n\n==Style and work==\nChicago trained herself in \"macho arts,\" taking classes in auto body work, [[boat building]], and pyrotechnics. Through auto body work she learned [[spray painting]] techniques and the skill to fuse color and surface to any type of media, which would become a signature of her later work. The skills learned through boat building would be used in her sculpture work, and pyrotechnics would be used to create [[fireworks]] for performance pieces. These skills allowed Chicago to bring [[fiberglass]] and [[metal]] into her sculpture, and eventually she would become an apprentice under [[Mim Silinsky]] to learn the art of porcelain painting, which would be used to create works in ''The Dinner Party''. Chicago also added the skill of [[stained glass]] to her artistic tool belt, which she used for ''The Holocaust Project''.<ref name=\"F280\"/> Photography became more present in Chicago's work as her relationship with photographer Donald Woodman developed.<ref name=\"W6\">Wylder and Lippard, 6</ref>  Since 2003, Chicago has been working with [[glass]].<ref name=\"PSU\"/>\n\nCollaboration is a major aspect of Chicago's installation works. ''The Dinner Party'', ''The Birth Project'' and ''The Holocaust Project'' were all completed as a collaborative process with Chicago and hundreds of volunteer participants. Volunteer artisans skills vary, often connected to \"stereotypical\" women's arts such as [[textile arts]].<ref name=\"F280\"/><ref name=\"F282\"/> Chicago makes a point to acknowledge her assistants as collaborators, a task at which other artists have notably failed.<ref name=\"The Guardian\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gerhard|first1=Jane|title=The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and the power of popular feminism. 1970\u20132007|date=2013|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Georgia|isbn=978-0-8203-3675-6|pages=2, 228}}</ref>\n\n==Through the Flower==\n\nIn 1978, Chicago founded [[Through the Flower]], a non-profit feminist art organization. The organization seeks to educate the public about the importance of art and how it can be used as a tool to emphasize women's achievements. Through the Flower also serves as the maintainer of Chicago's works, having handled the storage of ''The Dinner Party,'' before it found a permanent home at the Brooklyn Museum. The organization also maintained The Dinner Party Curriculum, which serves as a \"living curriculum\" for education about feminist art ideas and [[pedagogy]]. The online aspect of the curriculum was donated to [[Penn State University]] in 2011.<ref name=\"PSU\"/>\n\n==Teaching career==\n\nJudy Chicago became aware of the sexism that was rampant in modern art institutions, museums, and schools while getting her undergraduate and graduate degree at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in the 1960s. Ironically, she didn't challenge this observation as an undergrad. In fact, she did quite the opposite by trying to match \u2013 both in her artwork and in her personal style \u2013 \u00a0what she thought of as masculinity in the artistic styles and habits of her male counterparts. Not only did she begin to work with heavy industrial materials, but she also smoked cigars, dressed \u201cmasculine\u201d, and attended motorcycle shows.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chicago|first=Judy|last2=Meyer|first2=Laura|date=1995-12-28|title=Judy Chicago, Feminist Artist and Educator|journal=Women & Therapy|volume=17|issue=1\u20132|pages=125\u2013140|doi=10.1300/j015v17n01_13|issn=0270-3149}}</ref> This awareness continued to grow as she recognized how society did not see women as professional artists in the same way they recognized men. Angered by this, Chicago channeled this energy and used it to strengthen her feminist values as a person and teacher. While most teachers based their lessons on technique, visual forms, and color, the foundation for Chicago's teachings were on the content and social significance of the art, especially in [[feminism]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Keifer-Boyd|first=Karen|date=January 2007|title=From Content to Form: Judy Chicago's Pedagogy with Reflections by Judy Chicago|journal=Studies in Art Education|volume=48|issue=2|pages=134\u2013154|doi=10.1080/00393541.2007.11650096|issn=0039-3541}}</ref> Stemming from the male-dominated art community Chicago studied with for so many years, she valued art based on research, social or political views, and/or experience. She wanted her students to grow into their art professions without having to sacrifice what womanhood meant to them.

During the preparation phase, students identify a deep personal concern and then research that issue. In the process phase, students gather together in a group to discuss the materials they plan on using and the content of their work. Finally, in the art-making phase, students find materials, sketch, critique, and produce art.\n\n== Books by Chicago ==\n* ''The Dinner Party: A Symbol of our Heritage''.

Additionally, many of her books have been published in other countries, making her work more accessible to international readers. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as [[needlework]], counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as [[welding]] and [[pyrotechnics]]. Chicago's most well known work is ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', which is permanently installed in the [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum]]. ''The Dinner Party'' celebrates the accomplishments of women throughout history and is widely regarded as the first epic feminist artwork.

Her father came from a twenty-three generation lineage of [[rabbi]]s, including the [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] [[Vilna Gaon]]. Unlike his family predecessors, Arthur became a [[labor organization|labor organizer]] and a [[Marxist]].<ref name=\"F279\"/> He worked nights at a post office and took care of Chicago during the day, while May, who was a former dancer, worked as a [[medical secretary]].<ref name=\"A305\"/><ref name=\"F279\"/> Arthur's active participation in the [[American Communist Party]], liberal views towards women and support of workers' rights strongly influenced Chicago's ways of thinking and belief.<ref name=\"A306\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 306</ref> During the [[McCarthyism]] era in the 1950s, Arthur was investigated, which made it difficult for him to find work and caused the family much turmoil.<ref name=\"F279\"/> In 1945, while Chicago was alone at home with her infant brother, Ben, an [[FBI]] agent visited their house. The agent began to ask the six-year-old Chicago questions about her father and his friends, but the agent was interrupted upon the return of May to the house.<ref name=\"A306\"/> Arthur's health declined and he died in 1953 from [[peritonitis]]. May would not discuss his death with her children and did not allow them to attend the funeral. Chicago did not come to terms with his death until she was an adult; in the early 1960s she was hospitalized for almost a month with a bleeding ulcer attributed to unresolved [[grief]].<ref name=\"F279\">Felder and Rosen, 279.</ref>\n\nMay loved the arts, and instilled her passion for them in her children, as evident in Chicago's future as an artist, and brother Ben's eventual career as a [[pottery|potter]]. At age of three, Chicago began to draw and was sent to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] to attend classes.<ref name=\"F279\"/><ref name=\"W5\">Wydler and Lippard, 5.</ref> By the age of 5, Chicago knew that she \"never wanted to do anything but make art\"<ref name=\"W5\"/> and started attending classes at the Art Institute of Chicago.<ref name=\"The Guardian\" />  She applied but was denied admission to the Art Institute,<ref name=\"A306\"/> and instead attended [[UCLA]] on a scholarship.<ref name=\"F279\"/>\n\n==Education and early career==\n\nWhile at UCLA, she became politically active, designing posters for the UCLA [[NAACP]] chapter and eventually became its corresponding secretary.<ref name=\"A306\"/> In June 1959, she met and became romantically linked with Jerry Gerowitz. She left school and moved in with him, for the first time having her own studio space. The couple [[hitch hike]]d to New York in 1959, just as Chicago's mother and brother moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her.<ref name=\"A308\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 308</ref> The couple lived in [[Greenwich Village]] for a time, before returning in 1960 from Los Angeles to Chicago so she could finish her degree. Chicago married Gerowitz in 1961.<ref name=\"A311\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 311</ref> She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in 1962 and was a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]. Gerowitz died in a car crash in 1963, which devastated and caused Chicago to suffer from an [[identity crisis]] until later that decade. She received her [[Master of Fine Arts]] from UCLA in 1964.<ref name=\"F279\"/>\n\nWhile in grad school, Chicago's created a series that was [[abstract art|abstract]], yet easily recognized as male and female [[sexual organs]]. These early works were called ''Bigamy,'' and represented the death of her husband. One depicted an abstract [[human penis|penis]], which was \"stopped in flight\" before it could unite with a [[vagina|vaginal form]]. Her professors, who were mainly men, were dismayed over these works.<ref name=\"A311\"/> Despite the use of sexual organs in her work, Chicago refrained from using gender politics or identity as themes.\n\nIn 1965, Chicago displayed work in her first solo show, at the Rolf Nelson Gallery in Los Angeles; Chicago was one of only four female artists to take part in the show.<ref name=\"Illustrated Career History\">{{cite web|last=Chicago|first=Judy|title=Illustrated Career History|url=http://www.judychicago.com/about/career-history.php|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227074456/http://www.judychicago.com/about/career-history.php|archivedate=2014-02-27}}</ref> In 1968, Chicago was asked why she did not participate in the \"California Women in the Arts\" exhibition at the [[Lytton Center]], to which she answered, \"I won't show in any group defined as Woman, Jewish, or California. Someday when we all grow up there will be no labels.\" Chicago began working in [[ice sculpture]], which represented \"a metaphor for the preciousness of life,\" another reference towards her husband's death.<ref name=\"A314\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 314</ref>\n[[File:Pasadenalifesaversstudy.jpg|thumb|right|''Study for Pasadena Lifesavers,'' prismacolor, 1968.]]\n\nIn 1969, the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] exhibited a series of Chicago's spherical acrylic plastic dome sculptures and drawings in an \"experimental\" gallery. ''[[Art in America]]'' noted that Chicago's work was at the forefront of the [[conceptual art]] movement, and the ''Los Angeles Times'' described the work as showing no signs of \"theoretical New York type art.\"<ref name=\"A314\"/> Chicago would describe her early artwork as [[minimalist]] and as her trying to be \"one of the boys.\"<ref name=\"L455\">Lewis and Lewis, 455.</ref> Chicago would also experiment with [[performance art]], using [[fireworks]] and [[pyrotechnics]] to create \"atmospheres,\" which involved flashes of colored smoke being manipulated outdoors. Through this work she attempted to \"feminize\" and \"soften\" the landscape.<ref name=\"A315\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 315</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Chicago also began exploring her own sexuality in her work. She created the ''Pasadena Lifesavers,'' which was a series of abstract paintings that placed [[acrylic paint]] on [[Plexiglas]]. The works blended colors to create an illusion that the shapes \"turn, dissolve, open, close, vibrate, gesture, wiggle,\" representing her own discovery that \"I was [[orgasm|multi-orgasmic]].\" Chicago credited ''Pasadena Lifesavers,'' as being the major turning point in her work in relation to women's sexuality and representation.<ref name=\"A315\"/>\n\n===From Cohen to Gerowitz to Chicago: Name change===\n\nAs Chicago made a name for herself as an artist and came to know herself as a woman, she no longer felt connected to her last name, Cohen. This was due to the late grief of the death of her father and the lost connection to her name through marriage, Judith Gerowitz, after her husband's death. She decided to change her last name to something independent of being connected to a man by marriage or heritage.<ref name=\"F279\"/> In 1965, she married sculptor [[Lloyd Hamrol]]. (They divorced in 1979.)<ref name=\"F280\">Felder and Rosen, 280.</ref> Gallery owner [[Rolf Nelson]] nicknamed her \"Judy Chicago\"<ref name=\"F279\"/> because of her strong personality and thick [[Chicago accent]]. She decided this would be her new name. In legally changing her surname from the ethnically charged Gerowitz to the ethnically neutral Chicago, she freed herself from a certain social identity.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Jewish Identity in Modern Art History|last=Soussloff|first=Catherine|publisher=U of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=}}</ref> Chicago was appalled that her new husband's signature was required to change her name legally.<ref name=\"F280\"/> To celebrate the name change, she posed for the exhibition invitation dressed like a [[boxer]], wearing a [[sweatshirt]] with her new last name on it.<ref name=\"A315\"/> She also posted a banner across the gallery at her 1970 solo show at [[California State University, Fullerton|California State University at Fullerton]], that read: \"Judy Gerowitz hereby divests herself of all names imposed upon her through male social dominance and chooses her own name, Judy Chicago.\"<ref name=\"F280\"/> An advertisement with the same statement was also placed in ''[[Artforum]]'s'' October 1970 issue.<ref name=Levin2007p139>[[#SrcLevin2007|Levin, ''Becoming Judy Chicago; A Biography of the Artist'', p. 139]]</ref>\n\n==Artistic career==\n\n===The feminist art movement and the 1970s===\nIn 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at [[Fresno State College]], hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work.<ref name=\"A317\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 317</ref> At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape \"the presence and hence, the expectations of men.\"<ref name=\"A318\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 318</ref> She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the [[Feminist Art Program]], a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, [[Vanalyne Green]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], Cay Lang, [[Karen LeCocq]], Jan Lester, [[Chris Rush]], Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, [[Faith Wilding]], Shawnee Wollenman, [[Nancy Youdelman]], and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed $25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Institutional time : a critique of studio art education|last=1939\u2013|first=Chicago, Judy|isbn=9781580933667|oclc=851420315|year = 2014}}</ref> Later, Judy Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]] reestablished the [[Feminist Art Program]] at [[California Institute of the Arts]]. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by [[Joyce Aiken]] in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.{{refn|Aiken opened the all-women's [[co-op]] [[Gallery 25]] with her students, developed the Fresno Art Museum's Council of 100 and the Distinguished Women Artist Series, which helped develop programming and exhibitions about women at the museum.<ref name=\"Fresno1\">{{cite web |author1=Dr. Laura Meyer |author2=Nancy Youdelman | year= | title=A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Art Experiment | work=A Studio of their Own | publisher= | url=http://www.astudiooftheirown.org/legacy.html | accessdate=8 January 2011}}</ref>|group=nb}}\n\nChicago is considered one of the \"first-generation feminist artists,\" a group that also includes [[Mary Beth Edelson]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], and [[Rachel Rosenthal]].

In 1972, the program created [[Womanhouse]], alongside [[Miriam Schapiro]], which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art.<ref name=\"F280\"/> With [[Arlene Raven]] and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]], Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles [[Woman's Building]] in 1973.<ref name=\"AAA\">{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Woman's Building records, 1970\u20131992 | work=[[Archives of American Art]] | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/womans-building-records-6347/more#biohist | accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref> This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World's Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/Judy_Chicago#biography|title=Judy Chicago|website=SFMOMA|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref> This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as \"an experimental program in female education in the arts.

These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the \"feminine.\" Chicago was strongly influenced by [[Gerda Lerner]], whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of [[women's history]] would continue to struggle independently and collectively.<ref name=\"F280\"/>\n\n===Womanhouse===\n{{main|Womanhouse}}\nWomanhouse was a project that involved Judy Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]]. It began in the fall of 1971 and was the first public exhibition of Feminist Art. They wanted to start the year with a large scale collaborative project that involved woman artists who spent much of their time talking about their problems as women. They used those problems as fuel and dealt with them while working on the project. Judy thought that female students often approach art-making with an unwillingness to push their limits due to their lack of familiarity with tools and processes, and an inability to see themselves as working people. In this environment, female artists experimented with women's conventional roles and experiences and how these could be displayed. \"The aim of the Feminist Art Program is to help women restructure their personalities to be more consistent with their desires to be artists and to help them build their art-making out of their experiences as women.\"<ref name=Schapiro>{{cite web|last1=Schapiro|first1=Miriam|last2=Chicago|first2=Judy|title=Womanhouse catalog essay|url=http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|publisher=Womanhouse|accessdate=7 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611044304/http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|archive-date=11 June 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Womanhouse is a \"true\" dramatic representation of woman's experience beginning in childhood, encompassing the struggles at home, with housework, menstruation, marriage, etc.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1975, Chicago's first book, ''Through the Flower'', was published; it \"chronicled her struggles to find her own identity as a woman artist.\"<ref name=\"Illustrated Career History\" />\n\n===''The Dinner Party''===\n[[File:Judy Chicago The Dinner Party.JPG|thumb|right|''[[File:Judy Chicago The Dinner Party.jpg|thumb]] [[The Dinner Party]]'' as installed at the [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]\n{{Main|The Dinner Party}}\n\nChicago decided to take Lerner's lesson to heart and took action to teach women about ''their'' history.

The project came into fruition with the assistance of over 400 people, mainly women, who volunteered to assist in [[needlework]], creating sculptures and other aspects of the process.<ref name=\"F281\">Felder and Rosen, 281.</ref>  When ''The Dinner Party'' was first constructed, it was a traveling exhibition. Through the Flower, her non-profit organization, was originally created to cover the expense of the creation and travel of the artwork. [[Jan Gerhard Lassen|Jane Gerhard]] dedicated a book to Judy Chicago and ''The Dinner Party'', entitled \"The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and The Power of Popular Feminism, 1970\u20132007.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.throughtheflower.org|title=Through the Flower and Judy Chicago|website=www.throughtheflower.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref>\n\nInspiration for The Dinner Party came from personal experience where Chicago found herself at a male dominated event. This event included highly educated men and women, however the men dominated the conversation and essence of the space. Chicago highlights important women that are often overlooked, giving credit to those who have stepped up for women's rights. This work is less of a statement and more of an honoring and a form of gratitude and inspiration. Chicago wanted the piece to teach about the struggle for power and equality women have endured in a male dominant societies. It considers the possibility of a meeting between powerful women and how this could change human history.\n\nMany art critics, including [[Hilton Kramer]] from The New York Times, were unimpressed by her work.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/insider/judy-chicago-dinner-part-art-reviews-times.html | title=From 'Vicious' to Celebratory: The Times's Reviews of Judy Chicago's 'The Dinner Party'| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2018-02-28| last1=Pilat| first1=Kasia}}</ref> Mr. Kramer felt Chicago's intended vision was not conveyed through this piece and \"it looked like an outrageous libel on the female imagination.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Although art critics felt her work lacked depth and the dinner party was just \"vaginas on plates,\" it was popular and captivated the general public. Chicago debuted her work in six countries on three continents. She reached over a million people through her artwork. Her work might not have pleased critics but its feminist message captivated the public and it honored the its featured 39 historical figures and 999 other women.\n\n===''Birth Project'' and ''PowerPlay''===\n\nFrom 1980 until 1985, Chicago created ''Birth Project''. It took five years to create. The piece used images of [[childbirth]] to celebrate woman's role as mother. Chicago was inspired to create this collective work because of the lack of imagery and representation of birth in the art world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/08/style/judy-chicago-women-s-lives-and-art.html|title=JUDY CHICAGO: WOMEN'S LIVES AND ART|last=Bennetts|first=Leslie|date=1985-04-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-11|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The installation reinterpreted the [[Genesis creation narrative]], which focused on the idea that a male [[god]] created a male human, [[Adam]], without the involvement of a woman.<ref name=\"F281\"/> Chicago described the piece as revealing a \"primordial female self hidden among the recesses of my soul...the birthing woman is part of the dawn of creation.\"<ref name=\"W5\"/> 150 needleworkers from the United States, [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] assisted in the project, working on 100 panels, by [[quilting]], [[macrame]], [[embroidery]] and other techniques. The size of the piece means it is rarely displayed in its entirety. The majority of the pieces from ''Birth Project'' are held in the collection of the [[Albuquerque Museum]].<ref name=\"F281\"/>\n\nChicago was not personally interested in motherhood. While she admired the women who chose this path, she did not find it right for herself. As recently as 2012, she said, \"There was no way on this earth I could have had children and the career I've had.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\">{{cite news|last=Cooke|first=Rachel|title=The art of Judy Chicago|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/04/judy-chicago-art-feminism-britain|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Birth Project'', Chicago returned to independent studio work. She created ''PowerPlay,'' a series of drawings, [[weaving]]s, paintings, [[cast paper]] and bronze [[reliefs]]. Through the series, Chicago replaced the male [[gaze]] with a feminist one, exploring the construct of masculinity and how power has affected men.<ref name=\"JVL\">{{cite web | author= | year=2012 | title=Judy Chicago | website= | publisher=Jewish Virtual Library | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/jchicago.html | accessdate=15 Jan 2011}}</ref>\n\n===A new kind of collaboration and ''The Holocaust Project''===\n\nIn the mid-1980s Chicago's interests \"shifted beyond 'issues of female identity' to an exploration of masculine power and powerlessness in the context of the Holocaust.\"<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\">{{cite journal | title=Judy Chicago in the UK | author=Galit Mana | journal=[[Jewish Renaissance]] |date=October 2012 | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=42\u201343}}</ref> Chicago's ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' (1985\u201393)<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\"/> is a collaboration with her husband, photographer [[Donald Woodman]], whom she married on [[New Year's Eve]] 1985. Although Chicago's previous husbands were both [[Jewish]], it wasn't until she met Woodman that she began to explore her own Jewish heritage.  Chicago met poet Harvey Mudd, who had written an [[epic poem]] about the [[Holocaust]]. Chicago was interested in illustrating the poem, but decided to create her own work instead, using her own art, visual and written. Chicago worked alongside her husband to complete the piece, which took eight years to finish.<ref name=\"F281\"/> The piece, which documents victims of the Holocaust, was created during a time of personal loss in Chicago's life: the death of her brother Ben, from [[Lou Gehrig's disease]], and the death of her mother from [[cancer]].<ref name=\"F282\">Felder and Rosen, 282.</ref>\n\nChicago used the tragic event of the Holocaust as a prism through which to explore victimization, oppression, injustice, and human cruelty.<ref name=\":1\" /> To seek inspiration for the project, Chicago and Woodman watched the documentary ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', which comprises interviews with Holocaust survivors at  [[Nazi concentration camps]] and other relevant Holocaust sites.<ref name=\"F282\"/> They also explored photo archives and written pieces about the Holocaust.<ref name=\"W6\"/> They spent several months touring concentration camps and visited [[Israel]].<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\"/> Chicago brought other issues into the work, such as [[environmentalism]], [[Native American genocide]],<ref name=\"W5\"/> and the [[Vietnam War]]. With these subjects Chicago sought to relate contemporary issues to the moral dilemma behind the Holocaust.<ref name=\"F282\"/> This aspect of the work caused controversy within the Jewish community, due to the comparison of the Holocaust to these other historical and contemporary concerns.<ref name=\"W5\"/> ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' consists of sixteen large scale works made of a variety of mediums including: [[tapestry]], [[stained glass]], metal work, wood work, photography, painting, and the [[sewing]] of [[Audrey Cowan]]. The exhibit ends with a piece that displays a Jewish couple at [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. The piece comprises 3000 square feet, providing a full exhibition experience for the viewer.<ref name=\"F282\"/> ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' was exhibited for the first time in October 1993 at the [[Spertus Museum]] in Chicago.<ref name=\"F282\"/> Most of the work from the piece is held at the [[Holocaust Center (Pittsburgh)|Holocaust Center]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"F284\">Felder and Rosen, 284.</ref>\n\nOver the next six years, Chicago created works that explored the experiences of concentration camp victims.<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\"/> Galit Mana of ''Jewish Renaissance'' magazine notes, \"This shift in focus led Chicago to work on other projects with an emphasis on Jewish tradition\", including ''Voices from the Song of Songs'' (1997), where Chicago \"introduces feminism and female sexuality into her representation of strong biblical female characters.\"<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\"/>\n\n===Current work and life===\n\nIn 1985, Chicago was remarried, to photographer [[Donald Woodman]]. To celebrate the couple's 25th wedding anniversary, Chicago created a \"Renewal Ketubah\" in 2010.<ref name=\"Illustrated Career History\" />\n\nIn 1994, Judy Chicago started \"Resolutions: A Stitch in Time\" which took 6 years to complete. The public audience later got to see this project at the Museum of Art and Design in New York in 2000.<ref name=\"Judy Chicago\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/judy-chicago-9246631|title=Judy Chicago|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425120534/http://www.biography.com/people/judy-chicago-9246631|archive-date=2017-04-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Chicago and Woodman moved into the historic [[Belen Hotel]], an historic railroad hotel in [[Belen, New Mexico]] which Woodman had spent three years converting into a home.<ref name=\"Judy Chicago\"/>\n\nChicago's archives are held at the [[Schlesinger Library]] at [[Radcliffe College]], and her collection of women's history and culture books are held in the collection of the [[University of New Mexico]].

For the exhibition, she returned to the [[Pomona College]] football field, where in the late 1960s she had held a firework-based installation, and performed the piece again.<ref name=\"LAT1\">{{cite web | author=Jori Finkel | year=2011 | title=Q&A Judy Chicago | work=Censorship | publisher=Los Angeles Times | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/30/entertainment/la-ca-pst-judy-chicago-and-rebecca-mcgrew-2-20111030 | accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nChicago had two solo exhibitions in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2012, one in [[London]] and another in [[Liverpool]].<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\"/> The Liverpool exhibition included the launch of Chicago's book about [[Virginia Woolf]]. Once a peripheral part of her artistic expression, Chicago now considers writing to be well integrated into her career.<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\"/> That year, she was also awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Palm Springs Art Fair.<ref name=\"Judy Chicago\"/>\n\nShe was interviewed for the film ''[[!Women Art Revolution]]''.<ref name=a8>{{harvnb|Anon|2018}}</ref>\n\nChicago strives to push herself, exploring new directions for her art; she even attended car-body school to learn to air-brush and has recently begun to work in glass.<ref name=\"The Guardian\" /> Taking such risks is easier to do when one lives by Chicago's philosophy: \"I'm not career driven. [[Damien Hirst]]'s dots sold, so he made thousands of dots. I would, like, never do that! It wouldn't even occur to me.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\" /> Chicago's subject matter, however, has broadened from the focus of ''The Dinner Party''. In the words of the artist: \"I guess you could say that my eyes were lifted from my vagina.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\" />\n\nChicago has permanent collections in numerous museums around the world. Those include, [[The British Museum]], [[The Brooklyn Museum]], The [[Getty Trust]], The [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], [[New Mexico Museum of Art]], [[The National Gallery of Art]], [[The National Museum of Women in the Arts]], The [[Penn Academy of the Fine Arts]], and The [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artstor.org/content/judy-chicago|title=Judy Chicago {{!}} Artstor|website=www.artstor.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref>\n\nIn her interview with [[Gloria Steinem]], Chicago spoke of her \"goal as an artist\", stating that it \"\u2026has been to create images in which the female experience is the path to the universal, as opposed to learning everything through the male gaze.\"<ref>\"Judy Chicago\" by Gloria Steinem, December/January 2018 issue of \"Interview\", pp. 28\u201331</ref>\n\n==Style and work==\nChicago trained herself in \"macho arts,\" taking classes in auto body work, [[boat building]], and pyrotechnics. Through auto body work she learned [[spray painting]] techniques and the skill to fuse color and surface to any type of media, which would become a signature of her later work. The skills learned through boat building would be used in her sculpture work, and pyrotechnics would be used to create [[fireworks]] for performance pieces. These skills allowed Chicago to bring [[fiberglass]] and [[metal]] into her sculpture, and eventually she would become an apprentice under [[Mim Silinsky]] to learn the art of porcelain painting, which would be used to create works in ''The Dinner Party''. Chicago also added the skill of [[stained glass]] to her artistic tool belt, which she used for ''The Holocaust Project''.<ref name=\"F280\"/> Photography became more present in Chicago's work as her relationship with photographer Donald Woodman developed.<ref name=\"W6\">Wylder and Lippard, 6</ref>  Since 2003, Chicago has been working with [[glass]].<ref name=\"PSU\"/>\n\nCollaboration is a major aspect of Chicago's installation works. ''The Dinner Party'', ''The Birth Project'' and ''The Holocaust Project'' were all completed as a collaborative process with Chicago and hundreds of volunteer participants. Volunteer artisans skills vary, often connected to \"stereotypical\" women's arts such as [[textile arts]].<ref name=\"F280\"/><ref name=\"F282\"/> Chicago makes a point to acknowledge her assistants as collaborators, a task at which other artists have notably failed.<ref name=\"The Guardian\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gerhard|first1=Jane|title=The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and the power of popular feminism. 1970\u20132007|date=2013|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Georgia|isbn=978-0-8203-3675-6|pages=2, 228}}</ref>\n\n==Through the Flower==\n\nIn 1978, Chicago founded [[Through the Flower]], a non-profit feminist art organization. The organization seeks to educate the public about the importance of art and how it can be used as a tool to emphasize women's achievements. Through the Flower also serves as the maintainer of Chicago's works, having handled the storage of ''The Dinner Party,'' before it found a permanent home at the Brooklyn Museum. The organization also maintained The Dinner Party Curriculum, which serves as a \"living curriculum\" for education about feminist art ideas and [[pedagogy]]. The online aspect of the curriculum was donated to [[Penn State University]] in 2011.<ref name=\"PSU\"/>\n\n==Teaching career==\n\nJudy Chicago became aware of the sexism that was rampant in modern art institutions, museums, and schools while getting her undergraduate and graduate degree at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in the 1960s. Ironically, she didn't challenge this observation as an undergrad. In fact, she did quite the opposite by trying to match \u2013 both in her artwork and in her personal style \u2013 \u00a0what she thought of as masculinity in the artistic styles and habits of her male counterparts. Not only did she begin to work with heavy industrial materials, but she also smoked cigars, dressed \u201cmasculine\u201d, and attended motorcycle shows.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chicago|first=Judy|last2=Meyer|first2=Laura|date=1995-12-28|title=Judy Chicago, Feminist Artist and Educator|journal=Women & Therapy|volume=17|issue=1\u20132|pages=125\u2013140|doi=10.1300/j015v17n01_13|issn=0270-3149}}</ref> This awareness continued to grow as she recognized how society did not see women as professional artists in the same way they recognized men. Angered by this, Chicago channeled this energy and used it to strengthen her feminist values as a person and teacher. While most teachers based their lessons on technique, visual forms, and color, the foundation for Chicago's teachings were on the content and social significance of the art, especially in [[feminism]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Keifer-Boyd|first=Karen|date=January 2007|title=From Content to Form: Judy Chicago's Pedagogy with Reflections by Judy Chicago|journal=Studies in Art Education|volume=48|issue=2|pages=134\u2013154|doi=10.1080/00393541.2007.11650096|issn=0039-3541}}</ref> Stemming from the male-dominated art community Chicago studied with for so many years, she valued art based on research, social or political views, and/or experience. She wanted her students to grow into their art professions without having to sacrifice what womanhood meant to them. Chicago developed an art education methodology in which \"female-centered content,\" such as menstruation and giving birth, is encouraged by the teacher as \"[[The personal is political|personal is political]]\" content for art.<ref>Chicago, Judy, (n.d.).

She refers to her teaching methodology as \"participatory art [[pedagogy]].\"<ref>Keifer-Boyd, K. (2007). From content to form: Judy Chicago's pedagogy with reflections by Judy Chicago.

New York, NY: Monacelli Press.</ref> Several students involved in Judy Chicago's teaching projects established successful careers as artists, including [[Suzanne Lacy]], [[Faith Wilding]], and [[Nancy Youdelman]].\n\nIn the early 2000s, Chicago organized her teaching style into three parts preparation, process, and art-making.<ref name=\":2\" /> Each has a specific purpose and is crucial. During the preparation phase, students identify a deep personal concern and then research that issue. In the process phase, students gather together in a group to discuss the materials they plan on using and the content of their work. Finally, in the art-making phase, students find materials, sketch, critique, and produce art.\n\n== Books by Chicago ==\n* ''The Dinner Party: A Symbol of our Heritage''.
