Kirkbride appealed to Samuel for instructions. The political officer had a total force of only 50 Arab policemen at his disposal and quite simply did not know what to do. Several weeks later he received the following reply from Jerusalem: \u201cIt is considered most unlikely that the Emir Abdullah would advance into territory which is under British control... Two days later Abdullah\u2019s troops marched into British-controlled [[Moab]]. Unable to stop him, Kirkbride decided to welcome him instead. With Abdullah's arrival, the National Government of Moab went out of existence. Buoyed by his easy success, he decided to proceed to Amman. By the end of March 1921, Abdullah and his small army had effectively occupied most of Trans-Jordan unopposed... There seemed to be only two options. Either the British army had to be sent in to evict him or the French had to be allowed to cross the frontier to accomplish the task. Both courses of action were considered to be completely unacceptable. The government was simply not prepared to go to the expense of sending an army to fight in a territory of such marginal importance as Trans-Jordan, and it was equally inconceivable that British policy would permit French intervention and occupation of the area. There was, however, another alternative, which was suggested by Churchill. He observed that it was most important that the government of Trans-Jordan be compatible with that of Iraq because British strategy called for a direct overland link between Egypt and the Persian Gulf, which would have to cross both territories. Since in the meantime Feisal had been given the throne of Iraq, it might well serve British purposes to make his brother, Abdullah, ruler of Trans-Jordan or to appoint an indigenous leader approved by him.|isbn= 9780275966393}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Palestine===\n{{main|British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)}}\nIn early 1921, prior to the convening of the Cairo Conference, the Middle East Department of the [[Colonial Office]] set out the situation as follows:\n<blockquote>Distinction to be drawn between Palestine and Trans-Jordan under the Mandate. His Majesty's Government are responsible under the terms of the Mandate for establishing in Palestine a national home for the Jewish people. They are also pledged by the assurances given to the Sherif of Mecca in 1915 to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs in those portions of the (Turkish) vilayet of Damascus in which they are free to act without detriment to French interests. The western boundary of the Turkish vilayet of Damascus before the war was the River Jordan. Palestine and Trans-Jordan do not, therefore, stand upon quite the same footing. At the same time, the two areas are economically interdependent, and their development must be considered as a single problem. Further, His Majesty's Government have been entrusted with the Mandate for \"Palestine\". If they wish to assert their claim to Trans-Jordan and to avoid raising with other Powers the legal status of that area, they can only do so by proceeding upon the assumption that Trans-Jordan forms part of the area covered by the Palestine Mandate. In default of this assumption Trans-Jordan would be left, under article 132 of the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], to the disposal of the principal Allied Powers. Some means must be found of giving effect in Trans-Jordan to the terms of the Mandate consistently with \"recognition and support of the independence of the Arabs\".<ref>[''Memorandum drawn up in London by Middle East Department Prior to Palestine Conference''].

With the mandates of Palestine and Iraq awarded to Britain, Churchill wished to consult with Middle East experts. At his request, [[Gertrude Bell]], Sir Percy Cox, T. E. Lawrence, Sir [[Kinahan Cornwallis]], Sir Arnold T. Wilson, Iraqi minister of war Ja\u02bffar alAskari, Iraqi minister of finance Sasun Effendi (Sasson Heskayl), and others gathered in Cairo, Egypt. An additional outstanding question was the policy to be adopted in Transjordan to prevent anti-French military actions from being launched within the allied British zone of influence. The Hashemites were Associated Powers during the war, and a peaceful solution was urgently needed. The two most significant decisions of the conference were to offer the throne of Iraq to emir Faisal ibn Hussein (who became [[Faisal I of Iraq]]) and an emirate of Transjordan (now Jordan) to his brother Abdullah ibn Hussein (who became [[Abdullah I of Jordan]]). The conference provided the political blueprint for British administration in both Iraq and Transjordan, and in offering these two regions to the sons of Hussein bin Ali, Churchill stated that the spirit, if not the letter, of Britain's wartime promises to the Arabs might be fulfilled.

The government of the territory was, subject to the mandate, formed by Abdullah, brother of King Faisal I of Iraq, who had been at Amman since February 1921. Britain recognized Transjordan as an independent government on 15 May 1923, and gradually relinquished control, limiting its oversight to financial, military and foreign policy matters. This affected the goals of [[Revisionist Zionism]], which sought a state on both banks of the Jordan.

The southern region of [[Ma'an Governorate|Ma'an]]-[[Aqaba Governorate|Aqaba]], a large area with a small population of just 10,000,{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=229 (footnote 70)}} was [[Occupation of Ma'an|administered by OETA East (later the Arab Kingdom of Syria, and then Mandatory Transjordan) and claimed by the Kingdom of Hejaz]].{{sfn|Leatherdale|1983|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfn|Baker|1979|p=220}} In OETA East, Faisal had appointed a [[kaymakam]] (or sub-governor) at Ma'an, whereas the kaymakam at Aqaba, who \"disregarded both Husein in Mecca and Feisal in Damascus with impunity\" had been instructed by Hussein to extend his authority to Ma'an.{{sfn|Leatherdale|1983|pp=41\u201342}} This technical dispute did not rise to any form of open struggle, and the Kingdom of Hejaz was to take de facto control after Faisal's administration was defeated by the French.{{efn|Baker explained that \"The British had moved in to take advantage of the situation created by Husain's presence in Aqaba and pressed for the annexation of the Hejaz Vilayet of Ma'an to the mandated territory of Transjordan. This disputed area, containing Maan, Aqaba and Petra, had originally been part of the Damascus Vilayet during Ottoman times, though boundaries had never been very precise. It was seized first by the Army as it pushed north from Aqaba after 1917 and had then been included in O.E.T.A. East and, later, in Faisal's kingdom of Syria. Husain, however, had never accepted this and had stationed a Vali alongside Faisal's administrator, but the two men had worked in harmony so that the dispute never came to an open struggle. After Faisal's exile, the French mandate boundary had excluded this area and the British then considered it to be part of the Syrian rump which became Transjordan, though nothing was done to realise that claim, so Hejaz administration held de facto control. Britain had, however, made its position clear in August 1924 when it cabled Bullard: \"Please inform King Hussein officially that H.M.G. cannot acquiesce in his claim to concern himself directly with the administration of any portion of the territory of Transjordan for which H.M.G. are responsible under the mandate for Palestine\"\"{{sfn|Baker|1979|p=220}}}} Following the 1924\u201325 [[Saudi conquest of Hejaz]], Hussein's army fled to the Ma'an region, which was then formally announced as annexed by Abdullah's Transjordan. Ibn Saud privately agreed to respect this position in an exchange of letters at the time of the [[Treaty of Jeddah (1927)|1927 Treaty of Jeddah]].{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=100}}\n\nThe [[Negev]] region was added to Palestine on 10 July 1922, having been conceded by British representative John Philby \"in Trans-Jordan's name\".{{efn| Biger described this meeting as follows: \"Sovereignty over the Arava, from the south of the Dead Sea to Aqaba, was also discussed. Philby agreed, in Trans-Jordan's name, to give up the western bank of Wadi Arava (and thus all of the Negev area). Nevertheless, a precise borderline was still not determined along the territories of Palestine and Trans-Jordan. Philby's relinquishment of the Negev was necessary, because the future of this area was uncertain. In a discussion regarding the southern boundary, the Egyptian aspiration to acquire the Negev area was presented. On the other hand the southern part of Palestine belonged, according to one of the versions, to the sanjak (district) of Ma'an within the vilayet (province) of Hejaz. King Hussein of Hijaz demanded to receive this area after claiming that a transfer action, to add it to the vilayet of Syria (A-Sham) was supposed to be done in 1908. It is not clear whether this action was completed. Philby claimed that Emir Abdullah had his father's permission to negotiate over the future of the sanjak of Ma'an, which was actually ruled by him, and that he could therefore 'afford to concede' the area west of the Arava in favour of Palestine. This concession was made following British pressure and against the background of the demands of the Zionist Organization for direct contact between Palestine and the Red Sea. It led to the inclusion of the Negev triangle in Palestine's territory, although this area was not considered as part of the country in the many centuries that preceded the British occupation.\"{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=181; Biger references 10 July 1922 meeting notes, file 2.179, CZA}}}} Abdullah made a request for the Negev to be added to Transjordan in late 1922, and again in 1925, but this was rejected.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=184}}\n\nThe location of the Eastern border between Transjordan and Iraq was considered strategic with respect to the proposed construction of what became the [[Kirkuk\u2013Haifa oil pipeline]].{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=100}} It was first set out on 2 December 1922, in a treaty to which Transjordan was not party to \u2013 the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair Protocol]] between Iraq and Nejd.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133}} It described the western end of the Iraq-Nejd boundary as \"the Jebel Anazan situated in the neighbourhood of the intersection of latitude [[32nd parallel north|32 degrees north]] longitude [[39th meridian east|39 degrees east]] where the Iraq-Najd boundary terminated\", thereby implicitly confirming this as the point at which the Iraq-Nejd boundary became the Transjordan-Nejd boundary.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133}} This followed a proposal from Lawrence in January 1922 that Transjordan be extended to include [[Wadi Sirhan]] as far south as [[Dumat al-Jandal|al-Jauf]], in order to protect Britain's route to India and contain Ibn Saud.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133; Amadouny cites Lawrence, 'Transjordan-Extension of Territory', 5 January 1922, CO 733 33}}\n\nFrance transferred the District of Ramtha from Syria in 1921.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael R.

He dissolved the local governments formed by the British and established three administrative provinces (liwa\u2019): cAjlun, Balqa\u2019 and Karak. On 11 April 1921 he formed his first government. The newly appointed central administration was mainly staffed by Arab nationalist exiles. The first government was composed of four Syrians, a Palestinian, a Hijazi and only one native Transjordanian. The British offered financial assistance, administrative guidance and military support from Palestine upon request and maintained a watchful position. The sole organised and effective military force at hand was a Hijazi household army of some 200 men under Hashemite command. Peake's Reserve Force was still under construction and dysfunctional. (pg 40); From early 1922 until the autumn of 1923 the country enjoyed a period of stability during which the central administration succeeded in asserting its authority over the settled population. A change of personalities, resulting in more sympathetic British Representatives, Abdullah's recognition of his precarious situation, and an improved attitude of the Palestine government towards the independent administration of the country, contributed to the stabilisation of Transjordan and the subjugation of the settled tribes to the government's authority. More importantly, the resurrection of the Reserve Force, later renamed the Arab Legion, allowed for this success. (pg 49); Thus, in the summer of 1922, the government managed to gain the submission of the settled and semi-settled tribes. Peake and Philby reported on the satisfactory collection of taxes and good public order.45 Macan Abu Nowar asserts that, as early as August 1922, Abdullah could already point to several achievements in the process of state-building.

Assisted by the British and the famous Lawrence of Arabia (T. E. Lawrence), Sharif Hussein of Mecca led this successful revolt, which contributed to the Ottoman defeat in World War I and to the eventual establishment of the various Arab states. Jordan originally fell under the rule of King Faisal, son of Sharif Hussein and the principal military leader of the Arab Revolt. Jordanians, along with their Arab brothers from other regions, served in the new Arab government and sat in its parliament. After King Faisal was forced from the throne in July 1920 by the French military, the British high commissioner of Palestine, Sir Herbert Samuel, went to the town of Salt in Transjordan and declared that the territory, as had been secretly agreed by the British and French in the Sykes-Picot Agreement during World War I, was part of the British Mandatory Palestine. Amir (Prince) Abdullah, a younger son of Sharif Hussein, arrived in Jordan in the fall of 1920 with the intent of regaining Damascus for his Hashemite family. Because he had gained a following, the British decided to recognise his leadership in that territory and provide him with a subsidy in exchange for his not pursuing his original Damascus intentions. This arrangement was confirmed in a 27 March 1921, meeting between then colonial secretary, Winston Churchill, and Amir Abdullah. In addition, Jordan was officially removed from Britain's Palestine mandate and given a mandate status of its own.

Kirkbride appealed to Samuel for instructions. The political officer had a total force of only 50 Arab policemen at his disposal and quite simply did not know what to do. Several weeks later he received the following reply from Jerusalem: \u201cIt is considered most unlikely that the Emir Abdullah would advance into territory which is under British control... Two days later Abdullah\u2019s troops marched into British-controlled [[Moab]]. Unable to stop him, Kirkbride decided to welcome him instead. With Abdullah's arrival, the National Government of Moab went out of existence. Buoyed by his easy success, he decided to proceed to Amman. By the end of March 1921, Abdullah and his small army had effectively occupied most of Trans-Jordan unopposed... There seemed to be only two options. Either the British army had to be sent in to evict him or the French had to be allowed to cross the frontier to accomplish the task. Both courses of action were considered to be completely unacceptable. The government was simply not prepared to go to the expense of sending an army to fight in a territory of such marginal importance as Trans-Jordan, and it was equally inconceivable that British policy would permit French intervention and occupation of the area. There was, however, another alternative, which was suggested by Churchill. He observed that it was most important that the government of Trans-Jordan be compatible with that of Iraq because British strategy called for a direct overland link between Egypt and the Persian Gulf, which would have to cross both territories. Since in the meantime Feisal had been given the throne of Iraq, it might well serve British purposes to make his brother, Abdullah, ruler of Trans-Jordan or to appoint an indigenous leader approved by him.|isbn= 9780275966393}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Palestine===\n{{main|British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)}}\nIn early 1921, prior to the convening of the Cairo Conference, the Middle East Department of the [[Colonial Office]] set out the situation as follows:\n<blockquote>Distinction to be drawn between Palestine and Trans-Jordan under the Mandate. His Majesty's Government are responsible under the terms of the Mandate for establishing in Palestine a national home for the Jewish people. They are also pledged by the assurances given to the Sherif of Mecca in 1915 to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs in those portions of the (Turkish) vilayet of Damascus in which they are free to act without detriment to French interests. The western boundary of the Turkish vilayet of Damascus before the war was the River Jordan. Palestine and Trans-Jordan do not, therefore, stand upon quite the same footing. At the same time, the two areas are economically interdependent, and their development must be considered as a single problem. Further, His Majesty's Government have been entrusted with the Mandate for \"Palestine\". If they wish to assert their claim to Trans-Jordan and to avoid raising with other Powers the legal status of that area, they can only do so by proceeding upon the assumption that Trans-Jordan forms part of the area covered by the Palestine Mandate. In default of this assumption Trans-Jordan would be left, under article 132 of the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], to the disposal of the principal Allied Powers. Some means must be found of giving effect in Trans-Jordan to the terms of the Mandate consistently with \"recognition and support of the independence of the Arabs\".<ref>[''Memorandum drawn up in London by Middle East Department Prior to Palestine Conference''].

With the mandates of Palestine and Iraq awarded to Britain, Churchill wished to consult with Middle East experts. At his request, [[Gertrude Bell]], Sir Percy Cox, T. E. Lawrence, Sir [[Kinahan Cornwallis]], Sir Arnold T. Wilson, Iraqi minister of war Ja\u02bffar alAskari, Iraqi minister of finance Sasun Effendi (Sasson Heskayl), and others gathered in Cairo, Egypt. An additional outstanding question was the policy to be adopted in Transjordan to prevent anti-French military actions from being launched within the allied British zone of influence. The Hashemites were Associated Powers during the war, and a peaceful solution was urgently needed. The two most significant decisions of the conference were to offer the throne of Iraq to emir Faisal ibn Hussein (who became [[Faisal I of Iraq]]) and an emirate of Transjordan (now Jordan) to his brother Abdullah ibn Hussein (who became [[Abdullah I of Jordan]]). The conference provided the political blueprint for British administration in both Iraq and Transjordan, and in offering these two regions to the sons of Hussein bin Ali, Churchill stated that the spirit, if not the letter, of Britain's wartime promises to the Arabs might be fulfilled. After further discussions between Churchill and Abdullah in Jerusalem, it was mutually agreed that Transjordan was accepted into the mandatory area as an Arab country apart from Palestine with the proviso that it would be, initially for six months, under the nominal rule of the emir Abdullah and that it would not form part of the [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish national home]] to be established west of the River Jordan.<ref>Palestine Papers, 1917\u20131922, Doreen Ingrams, George Braziller 1973 Edition, pages 116\u2013117</ref><ref name=Lustick>{{Cite book|title=''For the Land and the Lord: Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel''|author=Ian Lustick|year=1988|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|page=[https://archive.org/details/forlandlordjewis0000lust/page/37 37]|isbn=978-0-87609-036-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forlandlordjewis0000lust/page/37}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1= Wilson|first1= Mary|title= King Abdullah, Britain and the Making of Jordan |url= https://books.google.com/?id=yUGYsBRpqPkC|accessdate= 26 February 2012|year= 1990|pages= 53|quote= Abdullah began by suggesting the unification of Palestine and Transjordan under an Arab ruler, or the unification of Transjordan and Iraq.

The southern region of [[Ma'an Governorate|Ma'an]]-[[Aqaba Governorate|Aqaba]], a large area with a small population of just 10,000,{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=229 (footnote 70)}} was [[Occupation of Ma'an|administered by OETA East (later the Arab Kingdom of Syria, and then Mandatory Transjordan) and claimed by the Kingdom of Hejaz]].{{sfn|Leatherdale|1983|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfn|Baker|1979|p=220}} In OETA East, Faisal had appointed a [[kaymakam]] (or sub-governor) at Ma'an, whereas the kaymakam at Aqaba, who \"disregarded both Husein in Mecca and Feisal in Damascus with impunity\" had been instructed by Hussein to extend his authority to Ma'an.{{sfn|Leatherdale|1983|pp=41\u201342}} This technical dispute did not rise to any form of open struggle, and the Kingdom of Hejaz was to take de facto control after Faisal's administration was defeated by the French.{{efn|Baker explained that \"The British had moved in to take advantage of the situation created by Husain's presence in Aqaba and pressed for the annexation of the Hejaz Vilayet of Ma'an to the mandated territory of Transjordan. This disputed area, containing Maan, Aqaba and Petra, had originally been part of the Damascus Vilayet during Ottoman times, though boundaries had never been very precise. It was seized first by the Army as it pushed north from Aqaba after 1917 and had then been included in O.E.T.A. East and, later, in Faisal's kingdom of Syria. Husain, however, had never accepted this and had stationed a Vali alongside Faisal's administrator, but the two men had worked in harmony so that the dispute never came to an open struggle. After Faisal's exile, the French mandate boundary had excluded this area and the British then considered it to be part of the Syrian rump which became Transjordan, though nothing was done to realise that claim, so Hejaz administration held de facto control. Britain had, however, made its position clear in August 1924 when it cabled Bullard: \"Please inform King Hussein officially that H.M.G. cannot acquiesce in his claim to concern himself directly with the administration of any portion of the territory of Transjordan for which H.M.G. are responsible under the mandate for Palestine\"\"{{sfn|Baker|1979|p=220}}}} Following the 1924-25 [[Saudi conquest of Hejaz]], Hussein's army fled to the Ma'an region, which was then formally announced as annexed by Abdullah's Transjordan. Ibn Saud privately agreed to respect this position in an exchange of letters at the time of the [[Treaty of Jeddah (1927)|1927 Treaty of Jeddah]].{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=100}}\n\nThe [[Negev]] region was added to Palestine on 10 July 1922, having been conceded by British representative John Philby \"in Trans-Jordan's name\".{{efn| Biger described this meeting as follows: \"Sovereignty over the Arava, from the south of the Dead Sea to Aqaba, was also discussed. Philby agreed, in Trans-Jordan's name, to give up the western bank of Wadi Arava (and thus all of the Negev area). Nevertheless, a precise borderline was still not determined along the territories of Palestine and Trans-Jordan. Philby's relinquishment of the Negev was necessary, because the future of this area was uncertain. In a discussion regarding the southern boundary, the Egyptian aspiration to acquire the Negev area was presented. On the other hand the southern part of Palestine belonged, according to one of the versions, to the sanjak (district) of Ma'an within the vilayet (province) of Hejaz. King Hussein of Hijaz demanded to receive this area after claiming that a transfer action, to add it to the vilayet of Syria (A-Sham) was supposed to be done in 1908. It is not clear whether this action was completed. Philby claimed that Emir Abdullah had his father's permission to negotiate over the future of the sanjak of Ma'an, which was actually ruled by him, and that he could therefore 'afford to concede' the area west of the Arava in favour of Palestine. This concession was made following British pressure and against the background of the demands of the Zionist Organization for direct contact between Palestine and the Red Sea. It led to the inclusion of the Negev triangle in Palestine's territory, although this area was not considered as part of the country in the many centuries that preceded the British occupation.\"{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=181; Biger references 10 July 1922 meeting notes, file 2.179, CZA}}}} Abdullah made a request for the Negev to be added to Transjordan in late 1922, and again in 1925, but this was rejected.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=184}}\n\nThe location of the Eastern border between Transjordan and Iraq was considered strategic with respect to the proposed construction of what became the [[Kirkuk\u2013Haifa oil pipeline]].{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=100}} It was first set out on 2 December 1922, in a treaty to which Transjordan was not party to \u2013 the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair Protocol]] between Iraq and Nejd.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133}} It described the western end of the Iraq-Nejd boundary as \"the Jebel Anazan situated in the neighbourhood of the intersection of latitude [[32nd parallel north|32 degrees north]] longitude [[39th meridian east|39 degrees east]] where the Iraq-Najd boundary terminated\", thereby implicitly confirming this as the point at which the Iraq-Nejd boundary became the Transjordan-Nejd boundary.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133}} This followed a proposal from Lawrence in January 1922 that Transjordan be extended to include [[Wadi Sirhan]] as far south as [[Dumat al-Jandal|al-Jauf]], in order to protect Britain's route to India and contain Ibn Saud.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133; Amadouny cites Lawrence, 'Transjordan-Extension of Territory', 5 January 1922, CO 733 33}}\n\nFrance transferred the District of Ramtha from Syria in 1921.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael R.

He dissolved the local governments formed by the British and established three administrative provinces (liwa\u2019): cAjlun, Balqa\u2019 and Karak. On 11 April 1921 he formed his first government. The newly appointed central administration was mainly staffed by Arab nationalist exiles. The first government was composed of four Syrians, a Palestinian, a Hijazi and only one native Transjordanian. The British offered financial assistance, administrative guidance and military support from Palestine upon request and maintained a watchful position. The sole organised and effective military force at hand was a Hijazi household army of some 200 men under Hashemite command. Peake's Reserve Force was still under construction and dysfunctional. (pg 40); From early 1922 until the autumn of 1923 the country enjoyed a period of stability during which the central administration succeeded in asserting its authority over the settled population. A change of personalities, resulting in more sympathetic British Representatives, Abdullah's recognition of his precarious situation, and an improved attitude of the Palestine government towards the independent administration of the country, contributed to the stabilisation of Transjordan and the subjugation of the settled tribes to the government's authority. More importantly, the resurrection of the Reserve Force, later renamed the Arab Legion, allowed for this success. (pg 49); Thus, in the summer of 1922, the government managed to gain the submission of the settled and semi-settled tribes. Peake and Philby reported on the satisfactory collection of taxes and good public order.45 Macan Abu Nowar asserts that, as early as August 1922, Abdullah could already point to several achievements in the process of state-building. His government maintained law and order, improved tax-collection, opened new schools and clinics, built roads, established telegraph and post office services and created sharci and civil courts.

Assisted by the British and the famous Lawrence of Arabia (T. E. Lawrence), Sharif Hussein of Mecca led this successful revolt, which contributed to the Ottoman defeat in World War I and to the eventual establishment of the various Arab states. Jordan originally fell under the rule of King Faisal, son of Sharif Hussein and the principal military leader of the Arab Revolt. Jordanians, along with their Arab brothers from other regions, served in the new Arab government and sat in its parliament. After King Faisal was forced from the throne in July 1920 by the French military, the British high commissioner of Palestine, Sir Herbert Samuel, went to the town of Salt in Transjordan and declared that the territory, as had been secretly agreed by the British and French in the Sykes-Picot Agreement during World War I, was part of the British Mandatory Palestine. Amir (Prince) Abdullah, a younger son of Sharif Hussein, arrived in Jordan in the fall of 1920 with the intent of regaining Damascus for his Hashemite family. Because he had gained a following, the British decided to recognise his leadership in that territory and provide him with a subsidy in exchange for his not pursuing his original Damascus intentions. This arrangement was confirmed in a 27 March 1921, meeting between then colonial secretary, Winston Churchill, and Amir Abdullah. In addition, Jordan was officially removed from Britain's Palestine mandate and given a mandate status of its own.

This [[computer platform]] was widely used in business through the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s.<ref name=\"Compupro816\"/> CP/M increased the market size for both hardware and software by greatly reducing the amount of programming required to install an application on a new manufacturer's computer.<ref name=\"InfoWorld May 1981\"/><ref name=\"InfoWorld July 1982\"/> An important driver of software innovation was the advent of (comparatively) low-cost microcomputers running CP/M, as independent programmers and [[hacker (hobbyist)|hackers]] bought them and shared their creations in [[user group]]s.<ref name=\"Commodore_128\"/> CP/M was displaced by [[DOS]] soon after the 1981 introduction of the [[IBM PC]].\n\n==Hardware model==\n[[File:Sanco 8001.jpg|thumb|right|Sanco 8001 computer, running under CP/M 2.2 (1982).]]\n[[File:Commodore CP-M cartridge for the C64 (main).jpg|thumb|right|CP/M cartridge for the [[Commodore 64]].]]\nA minimal 8-bit CP/M system would contain the following components:\n* A [[computer terminal]] using the [[ASCII]] character set\n* An Intel 8080 (and later the 8085) or [[Zilog Z80]] microprocessor\n** The [[NEC V20]] and [[NEC V30|V30]] processors support an 8080-emulation mode that can run 8-bit CP/M on a PC&nbsp;DOS/MS-DOS computer so equipped, though any PC can also run the 16-bit CP/M-86.<ref name=\"CP/M-Emu\"/><ref name=\"Davis_1985_NEC\"/>\n* At least 16 kilobytes of [[Random access memory|RAM]], beginning at address 0\n* A means to [[Bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrap]] the first sector of the diskette\n* At least one [[floppy disk]] drive\n\nThe only hardware system that CP/M, as sold by Digital Research, would support was the Intel 8080 Development System. Manufacturers of CP/M-compatible systems customized portions of the operating system for their own combination of installed memory, disk drives, and console devices. CP/M would also run on systems based on the Zilog Z80 processor since the Z80 was compatible with 8080 code. While the Digital Research distributed core of CP/M (BDOS, CCP, core transient commands) did not use any of the Z80-specific instructions, many Z80-based systems used Z80 code in the system-specific BIOS, and many applications were dedicated to Z80-based CP/M machines.\n\nOn most machines the bootstrap was a minimal [[bootloader]] in [[Read only memory|ROM]] combined with some means of minimal [[bank switching]] or a means of injecting code on the bus (since the 8080 needs to see boot code at Address 0 for start-up, while CP/M needs RAM there); for others, this bootstrap had to be entered into memory using [[front panel|front-panel]] controls each time the system was started.\n\nCP/M used the 7-bit ASCII set. The other 128 characters made possible by the 8-bit byte were not standardized. For example, one [[Kaypro]] used them for Greek characters, and [[Osborne Computer Corporation|Osborne]] machines used the 8th bit set to indicate an underlined character. [[WordStar]] used the 8th bit as an end-of-word marker. International CP/M systems most commonly used the [[ISO 646]] norm for localized character sets, replacing certain ASCII characters with localized characters rather than adding them beyond the 7-bit boundary.\n\n==Components of the operating system==\nIn the 8-bit versions, while running, the CP/M operating system loaded into memory had three components:<ref name=\"CPM.NYT83\"/>\n* ''[[#BIOS|Basic Input/Output System]]'' (BIOS),\n* ''[[#BDOS|Basic Disk Operating System]]'' (BDOS),\n* ''[[#CCP|Console Command Processor]]'' (CCP).\nThe BIOS and BDOS were memory-resident, while the CCP was memory-resident unless overwritten by an application, in which case it was automatically reloaded after the application finished running. A number of transient commands for standard utilities were also provided. The transient commands resided in [[Computer file|files]] with the [[filename extension|extension]] .COM on disk.\n\nThe BIOS directly controlled hardware components other than the CPU and main memory. It contained functions such as character input and output and the reading and writing of disk sectors. The BDOS implemented the CP/M [[file system]] and some input/output abstractions (such as redirection) on top of the BIOS. The CCP took user commands and either executed them directly (internal commands such as DIR to show a directory or ERA to delete a file) or loaded and started an executable file of the given name (transient commands such as PIP.COM to copy files or STAT.COM to show various file and system information). Third-party applications for CP/M were also essentially transient commands.\n\nThe BDOS, CCP and standard transient commands were (ideally) the same in all installations of a particular revision of CP/M, but the BIOS portion was always adapted to the particular hardware. Adding memory to a computer, for example, meant that the CP/M system had to be reinstalled with an updated BIOS capable of addressing the additional memory. A utility was provided to patch the supplied BIOS, BDOS and CCP to allow them to be run from higher memory. Once installed, the operating system (BIOS, BDOS and CCP) was stored in reserved areas at the beginning of any disk which would be used to boot the system. On start-up, the bootloader (usually contained in a ROM firmware chip) would load the operating system from the disk in drive <code>A:</code>.\n\nBy modern standards CP/M was primitive, owing to the extreme constraints on program size. With version 1.0 there was no provision for detecting a changed disk. If a user changed disks without manually rereading the disk directory the system would write on the new disk using the old disk's directory information, ruining the data stored on the disk. From version 1.1 or 1.2 onwards, changing a disk then trying to write to it before its directory was read would cause a fatal error to be signalled. This avoided overwriting the disk but required a reboot and loss of the data that was to be stored on disk.\n\nThe majority of the complexity in CP/M was isolated in the BDOS, and to a lesser extent, the CCP and transient commands. This meant that by porting the limited number of simple routines in the BIOS to a particular hardware platform, the entire OS would work. This significantly reduced the development time needed to support new machines, and was one of the main reasons for CP/M's widespread use. Today this sort of abstraction is common to most OSs (a [[hardware abstraction layer]]), but at the time of CP/M's birth, OSs were typically intended to run on only one machine platform, and multilayer designs were considered unnecessary.\n\n==={{anchor|CCP}}Console Command Processor===\n<!-- This section may be linked to from inside or outside this article. Do not rename without keeping in sync. -->\n[[File:Commodore C128 CPM Screenshot 2 full.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Screenshot showing a CP/M 3.0 directory listing using the <code>[[dir (command)|DIR]]</code> command on a [[Commodore 128]] home computer.]]\nThe Console Command Processor, or CCP, accepted input from the keyboard and conveyed results to the terminal. CP/M itself would work with either a printing terminal or a video terminal. All CP/M commands had to be typed in on the [[command line]]. The console would most often display the <code>A></code> prompt, to indicate the current default disk drive. When used with a video terminal, this would usually be followed by a blinking [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] supplied by the terminal. The CCP would await input from the user.\n\nA CCP internal command, of the form drive letter followed by a colon, could be used to select the default drive. For example, typing <code>B:</code> and pressing enter at the command prompt would change the default drive to B, and the command prompt would then become <code>B></code> to indicate this change.\n\nCP/M's [[command-line interface]] was patterned after the operating systems from [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital Equipment]], such as [[RT-11]] for the [[PDP-11]] and [[OS/8]] for the [[PDP-8]].\n\nCommands took the form of a keyword followed by a list of parameters separated by spaces or special characters. Similar to a Unix [[shell builtin]], if an internal command was recognized, it was carried out by the CCP itself. Otherwise it would attempt to find an executable file on the currently logged disk drive and (in later versions) user area, load it, and pass it any additional parameters from the command line. These were referred to as \"transient\" programs. On completion, CP/M would reload the part of the CCP that had been overwritten by application programs \u2014 this allowed transient programs a larger memory space.\n\nThe commands themselves could sometimes be obscure. For instance, the command to duplicate files was named <code>[[Peripheral Interchange Program|PIP]]</code> (Peripheral-Interchange-Program), the name of the old [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] utility used for that purpose. The format of parameters given to a program was not standardized, so that there was no single option character that differentiated options from file names. Different programs could and did use different characters.\n\n===={{anchor|MOVCPM}}Commands====\nThe following list of [[Shell builtin|built-in]] [[command (computing)|commands]] are supported by the CP/M Console Command Processor:<ref name=\"CPM22\"/>\n* [[DIR (CP/M command)|DIR]]\n* [[ERA (CP/M command)|ERA]]\n* [[REN (CP/M command)|REN]]\n* [[SAVE (CP/M command)|SAVE]]\n* [[TYPE (CP/M command)|TYPE]]\n* [[USER (CP/M command)|USER]]\n\nTransient commands in CP/M include:<ref name=\"CPM22\"/>\n* [[Assembler (computing)|ASM]]\n* [[DDT (CP/M command)|DDT]]\n* [[DUMP (CP/M command)|DUMP]]\n* [[ED (CP/M command)|ED]]\n* [[LOAD (CP/M command)|LOAD]]\n* {{ill|MOVCPM|pl|MOVCPM (CP/M)}}\n* [[PIP (CP/M command)|PIP]]\n* [[STAT (CP/M command)|STAT]]\n* [[SUBMIT (CP/M command)|SUBMIT]]\n* [[SYSGEN (CP/M command)|SYSGEN]]\n\nCP/M Plus (CP/M Version 3) includes the following built-in commands:<ref name=\"CPM3_1983_PG\"/>\n* DIR \u2013 display list of files from a directory except those marked with the SYS attribute\n* [[DIRSYS (CP/M command)|DIRSYS]] \u2013 list files marked with the SYS attribute in the directory\n* [[ERASE (CP/M command)|ERASE]] \u2013 delete a file\n* [[RENAME (CP/M command)|RENAME]] \u2013 rename a file\n* TYPE \u2013 display contents of an ASCII character file\n* USER \u2013 change user number\n\n==={{anchor|BDOS}}Basic Disk Operating System===\n<!-- This section may be linked to from inside or outside this article. Do not rename without keeping in sync. -->\nThe Basic Disk Operating System,<ref name=\"Kildall_1975_BDOS\"/><ref name=\"Kildall_1980_CPM\"/> or BDOS,<ref name=\"Kildall_1975_BDOS\"/><ref name=\"Kildall_1980_CPM\"/> provided access to such operations as opening a file, output to the console, or printing. Application programs would load processor registers with a function code for the operation, and addresses for parameters or memory buffers, and call a fixed address in memory. Since the address was the same independent of the amount of memory in the system, application programs would run the same way for any type or configuration of hardware.\n\n==={{anchor|BIOS}}Basic Input Output System===\n[[File:CP\u2044M Ad, Dec 11, 1978.png|thumbnail|right|CP/M advertisement in the 11 December 1978, issue of ''[[InfoWorld]]'' magazine]]\n<!-- This section may be linked to from inside or outside this article.

The BDOS handled some of the buffering of data from the diskette, but before CP/M&nbsp;3.0 it assumed a disk sector size fixed at 128 bytes, as used on [[single-density]] 8-inch floppy disks. Since most 5.25-inch disk formats used larger sectors, the blocking and deblocking and the management of a disk buffer area was handled by model-specific code in the BIOS.\n\nCustomization was required because hardware choices were not constrained by compatibility with any one popular standard. For example, some manufacturers used a separate computer terminal, while others designed a built-in integrated video display system. Serial ports for printers and modems could use different types of [[UART]] chips, and port addresses were not fixed. Some machines used memory-mapped I/O instead of the 8080 I/O address space. All of these variations in the hardware were concealed from other modules of the system by use of the BIOS, which used standard entry points for the services required to run CP/M such as character I/O or accessing a disk block. Since support for serial communication to a modem was very rudimentary in the BIOS or may have been absent altogether, it was common practice for CP/M programs that used modems to have a user-installed overlay containing all the code required to access a particular machine's serial port.\n\n==={{anchor|FDOS|2.2}}File system===\nFile names were specified as a string of up to eight characters, followed by a period, followed by a file name extension of up to three characters ([[8.3 filename|\"8.3\" filename format]]). The extension usually identified the type of the file. For example, <code>.COM</code> indicated an executable program file, and <code>.TXT</code> indicated a file containing [[ASCII]] text.\n\nEach disk drive was identified by a [[drive letter]], for example drive <code>A</code> and drive <code>B</code>. To refer to a file on a specific drive, the drive letter was prefixed to the file name, separated by a colon, e.g. <code>A:FILE.TXT</code>. With no drive letter prefixed, access was to files on the current default drive.<ref name=\"px4\"/>\n\nThe \"8.3\" filename format and the drive letter + colon combination survived into MS-DOS. The drive letter + colon convention has survived in [[Microsoft Windows]] and is still used today. In addition, file extensions (for example, <code>[[.txt]]</code>, <code>[[COM file|.com]]</code> (a [[compiled]] file), or <code>[[.exe]]</code> (an [[executable]] file)) are still used to identify file types on many operating systems.\n\nFile size was specified as the number of 128 byte ''records'' (directly corresponding to disk sectors on 8-inch drives) occupied by a file on the disk. There was no generally supported way of specifying byte-exact file sizes. The current size of a file was maintained in the file's [[File Control Block]] (FCB) by the operating system. Since many application programs (such as [[text editors]]) prefer to deal with files as sequences of characters rather than as sequences of records, by convention text files were terminated with a [[control-Z]] character ([[ASCII]] [[Substitute character|SUB]], [[hexadecimal]] 1A). Determining the [[End-of-file|end]] of a [[text file]] therefore involved examining the last record of the file to locate the terminating control-Z. This also meant that inserting a control-Z character into the middle of a file usually had the effect of truncating the text contents of the file.\n\nWith the advent of larger removable and fixed disk drives, disk de-blocking formulas were employed which resulted in more disk blocks per logical file allocation block. While this allowed for larger file sizes, it also meant that the smallest file which could be allocated increased in size from 1&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] (on single-density drives) to 2&nbsp;KB (on double-density drives) and so on, up to 32&nbsp;KB for a file containing only a single byte. This made for inefficient use of disk space if the disk contained a large number of small files.\n\nFile modification [[system time|time stamps]] were not supported in releases up to CP/M&nbsp;2.2, but were an optional feature in [[MP/M]] and CP/M&nbsp;3.0.\n\nCP/M&nbsp;2.2 had no subdirectories in the file structure, but provided 16 numbered user areas to organize files on a disk. To change user one had to simply type \"User X\" at the command prompt, X being the number of the user wanted; security was non-existent and not believed to be necessary. The user area concept was to make the single-user version of CP/M somewhat compatible with multi-user MP/M systems. A common patch for the CP/M and derivative operating systems was to make one user area accessible to the user independent of the currently set user area. A USER command allowed the user area to be changed to any area from 0 to 15. User 0 was the default. If one changed to another user, such as USER 1, the material saved on the disk for this user would only be available to USER 1; USER 2 would not be able to see it or access it. However, files stored in the USER 0 area were accessible to all other users; their location was specified with a prefatory [[Path (computing)|path]], since the files of USER 0 were only visible to someone logged in as USER 0. The user area feature arguably had little utility on small floppy disks, but it was useful for organizing files on machines with [[hard drive]]s. The intent of the feature was to ease use of the same computer for different tasks. For example, a secretary could do [[data entry clerk|data entry]], then, after switching USER areas, another employee could use the machine to do [[Invoice|billing]] without their files intermixing.\n\n==={{anchor|TPA}}Transient Program Area===\nThe read/write memory between address 0100 hexadecimal and the lowest address of the BDOS was the ''Transient Program Area'' (TPA) available for CP/M application programs. Although all Z80 and 8080 processors could address 64 kilobytes of memory, the amount available for application programs could vary, depending on the design of the particular computer. Some computers used large parts of the address space for such things as BIOS ROMs, or video display memory. As a result, some systems had more TPA memory available than others. Bank switching was a common technique that allowed systems to have a large TPA while switching out ROM or video memory space as needed. CP/M&nbsp;3.0 allowed parts of the BDOS to be in bank-switched memory as well.\n\n===Debugging application===\nCP/M came with a Dynamic Debugging Tool, nicknamed [[Dynamic debugging technique|DDT]] (after the insecticide, i.e. a [[Software bug|bug]]-killer), which allowed memory and program modules to be examined and manipulated, and allowed a program to be executed one step at a time.<ref name=\"DDT1\"/><ref name=\"DDT2\"/><ref name=\"DDT3\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|RSX|RSM}}Resident programs===\nCP/M originally did not support the equivalent of [[terminate and stay resident]] (TSR) programs as under DOS. Programmers could write software that could intercept certain operating system calls and extend or alter their functionality. Using this capability, programmers developed and sold auxiliary [[desk accessory]] programs, such as [[SmartKey]], a keyboard utility to assign any string of bytes to any key.<ref name=\"Software_Catalog_1984\"/>\nCP/M&nbsp;3, however, added support for [[dynamic loading|dynamically loadable]] ''Resident System Extensions'' (RSX).<ref name=\"CPM3_1983_PG\"/> Similar solutions like RSMs (for ''Resident System Modules'') were also retrofitted to CP/M&nbsp;2.2 systems by third-parties.<ref name=\"ct_1\"/><ref name=\"ct_2\"/><ref name=\"Huck_2016\"/>\n\n===Installation===\nAlthough CP/M provided some [[hardware abstraction]] to standardize the interface to disk I/O or console I/O, typically application programs still required installation to make use of all the features of such equipment as printers and terminals. Often these were controlled by [[escape sequence]]s which had to be altered for different devices. For example, the escape sequence to select bold face on a printer would have differed among manufacturers, and sometimes among models within a manufacturer's range. This procedure was not defined by the operating system; a user would typically run an installation program that would either allow selection from a range of devices, or else allow feature-by-feature editing of the escape sequences required to access a function. This had to be repeated for each application program, since there was no central operating system service provided for these devices.\n\nThe initializing codes for each model of printer had to be written into the application. To use a program such as Wordstar with more than one printer (say, a fast dot matrix printer or a slower but presentation-quality [[daisy wheel]] printer), a separate version of Wordstar had to be prepared, and one had to load the Wordstar version that corresponded to the printer selected (and exiting and reloading to change printers).\n\n==History==\n[[File:CP\u2044M Ad, InfoWorld, November 29, 1982.jpg|thumbnail|right|CP/M advertisement in the 29 November 1982 issue of ''[[InfoWorld]]'' magazine]]\n==={{anchor|1.0|1.1|1.2|1.3|1.4}}The beginning and CP/M's heyday===\n[[Gary Kildall]] originally developed CP/M during 1974,<ref name=\"Shustek_2016\"/><ref name=\"Kildall_1993\"/> as an operating system to run on an [[Intel]] [[Intellec|Intellec-8]] development system, equipped with a [[Shugart Associates]] 8-inch [[floppy disk drive]] interfaced via a custom [[floppy disk controller]].<ref name=\"Kildall_1980_CPM\"/> It was written in Kildall's own [[PL/M]] (''[[Programming Language]] for Microcomputers'').<ref name=\"Kildall_1975_BDOS\"/> Various aspects of CP/M were influenced by the [[TOPS-10]] operating system of the [[DECsystem-10]] [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computer, which Kildall had used as a development environment.<ref name=\"johnson\"/><ref name=\"Dr. Dobb's Journal Apr 1976\"/><ref name=\"Digital Research (Firm)\"/>\n\n====The name====\nCP/M originally stood for \"Control Program/Monitor\",<ref name=\"CPM.NYT83\"/> a name which implies a [[resident monitor]]\u2014a primitive precursor to the operating system. However, during the conversion of CP/M to a commercial product, trademark registration documents filed in November 1977 gave the product's name as \"Control Program for Microcomputers\".<ref name=\"Kildall_1993\"/> The CP/M name follows a prevailing naming scheme of the time, as in Kildall's PL/M language, and Prime Computer's [[PL/P]] (''Programming Language for Prime''), both suggesting IBM's [[PL/I]]; and IBM's [[CP/CMS]] operating system, which Kildall had used when working at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] (NPS).\n\nThis renaming of CP/M was part of a larger effort by Kildall and his wife/business partner, Dorothy McEwen<ref name=\"Kildall.NYT\"/> to convert Kildall's personal project of CP/M and the Intel-contracted PL/M compiler into a commercial enterprise. The Kildalls intended to establish the Digital Research brand and its product lines as synonymous with \"microcomputer\" in the consumer's mind, similar to what IBM and Microsoft together later successfully accomplished in making \"personal computer\" synonymous with their product offerings.\n\nIntergalactic Digital Research, Inc. was later renamed via a corporation change-of-name filing to Digital Research, Inc.<ref name=\"Kildall.NYT\"/>\n\n====Portability====\nBy September 1981 Digital Research had sold more than {{val|250000}} CP/M licenses; ''[[InfoWorld]]'' stated that the actual market was likely larger because of sublicenses. Many different companies produced CP/M-based computers for many different markets; the magazine stated that \"CP/M is well on its way to establishing itself as ''the'' small-computer operating system\".{{r|hogan19810914state}}\nThe companies chose to support CP/M because of its large library of software. The [[Xerox 820]] ran the operating system because \"where there are literally thousands of programs written for it, it would be unwise not to take advantage of it\", Xerox said.<ref name=\"wise19820510\"/> (Xerox included a [[Howard W. Sams]] CP/M manual as compensation for Digital Research's documentation, which ''InfoWorld'' in 1982 described as atrocious.<ref name=\"meyer19820614\"/>) By 1984 [[Columbia University]] used the same source code to build [[Kermit (protocol)|Kermit]] binaries for more than a dozen different CP/M systems, plus a generic version.<ref name=\"dacruz19840427\"/> The operating system was described as a \"[[software bus]]\", allowing multiple programs to interact with different hardware in a standardized way.<ref name=\"Swaine_1997_Entrepreneurship\"/> Programs written for CP/M were typically portable among different machines, usually requiring only the specification of the [[escape sequence]]s for control of the [[computer terminal|screen]] and printer. This portability made CP/M popular, and much more software was written for CP/M than for operating systems that ran on only one brand of hardware. One restriction on portability was that certain programs used the extended instruction set of the Z80 processor and would not operate on an 8080 or 8085 processor. Another was graphics routines, especially in games and graphics programs, which were generally machine-specific as they used direct hardware access for speed, bypassing the OS and BIOS (this was also a common problem in early DOS machines).{{citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=Certainly a common problem for DOS programs, but CP/M programs typically were more configurable and thus less machine-specific. Therefore this needs to be sourced by a RS.}}\n\n[[File:M Karte.JPG|thumb|right|Apple ''CP/M Card'' with manual]]\n[[Bill Gates]] claimed that the [[Apple II family]] with a [[Z-80 SoftCard]] was the single most-popular CP/M hardware platform.<ref name=\"bunnell19820203\"/> Many different brands of machines ran the operating system, some notable examples being the [[Altair 8800]], the [[IMSAI 8080]], the [[Osborne 1]] and Kaypro [[luggable]]s, and [[MSX]] computers. The best-selling CP/M-capable system of all time was probably the [[Amstrad PCW]]. In the UK, CP/M was also available on [[Research Machines]] educational computers (with the CP/M source code published as an educational resource), and for the [[BBC Micro]] when equipped with a Z80 co-processor. Furthermore, it was available for the [[Amstrad CPC]] series, the [[Commodore 128]], [[TRS-80]], and later models of the [[ZX Spectrum]]. CP/M&nbsp;3 was also used on the [[NIAT]], a custom handheld computer designed for [[A.C. Nielsen]]'s internal use with 1&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]] of [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] memory.\n\n====Applications====\n[[File:Wordstar 4 CPM.jpg|thumb|right|Distribution 5 1/4 inch diskettes and packaging for the last version (Version 4) of [[WordStar]] word processing program released for 8-bit CP/M.]]\n[[WordStar]], one of the first widely used [[word processor]]s, and [[dBase]], an early and popular database program for microcomputers, were originally written for CP/M. Two early [[outliner]]s, [[KAMAS (program)|KAMAS]] (Knowledge and Mind Amplification System) and its cut-down successor Out-Think (without programming facilities and retooled for 8080/V20 compatibility) were also written for CP/M, though later rewritten for MS-DOS. [[Turbo Pascal]], the ancestor of [[Borland Delphi]], and [[Multiplan]], the ancestor of [[Microsoft Excel]], also debuted on CP/M before MS-DOS versions became available. [[Visicalc]], the first-ever spreadsheet program, was made available for CP/M. Another company, [[Sorcim]], created its [[SuperCalc]] spreadsheet for CP/M, which would go on to become the market leader and de facto standard on CP/M. Supercalc would go on to be a competitor in the spreadsheet market in the MS-DOS world. [[AutoCAD]], a CAD application from Autodesk debuted on CP/M. A host of compilers and interpreters for popular [[programming language]]s of the time (such as [[BASIC]], [[Borland]]'s [[Turbo Pascal]], [[FORTRAN]] and even [[PL/I]]<ref name=\"PL1\"/>) were available, among them several of the earliest [[Microsoft]] products.\n\nCP/M software often came with [[installer]]s that adapted it to a wide variety of computers.<ref name=\"mace19840109_16\"/> The source code for BASIC programs was easily accessible, and most forms of [[copy protection]] were ineffective on the operating system.<ref name=\"pournelle198306\"/> A Kaypro II owner, for example, would obtain software on Xerox 820 format, then copy it to and run it from Kaypro-format disks.{{r|derfler19821018}}\n\nThe lack of standardized graphics support limited [[video games]], but various character and text-based games were [[ported]], such as ''[[Telengard]]'',<ref name=\"loguidice20120728\"/> ''[[Gorillas (video game)|Gorillas]]'',<ref name=\"githubgorilla001\"/> ''[[Hamurabi (video game)|Hamurabi]]'', ''[[Lunar Lander (video game series)|Lunar Lander]]'', along with early [[interactive fiction]] including the [[Zork]] series and ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]''. A [[text adventure]] specialist, [[Infocom]] was one of the few publishers to consistently release their games in CP/M format. [[Lifeboat Associates]] started collecting and distributing user-written \"free\" software. One of the first was [[XMODEM]], which allowed reliable file transfers via [[modem]] and phone line. Another program native to CP/M was the [[outline processor]] [[KAMAS (program)|KAMAS]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n====Disk formats====\n[[IBM System/34]] and [[IBM 3740]]'s single-density, single-sided format is CP/M's standard 8-inch [[floppy disk format]]. No standard 5.25-inch CP/M disk format exists, with Kaypro, [[Morrow Designs]], Osborne, and others using their own.<ref name=\"pournelle198204\"/>{{r|meyer19820614}}<ref name=\"128book\"/> ''InfoWorld'' estimated in September 1981 that \"about two dozen formats were popular enough that software creators had to consider them to reach the broadest possible market\".<ref name=\"hogan19810914state\"/> [[JRT Pascal]], for example, provided versions on 5.25-inch disk for [[North Star Computers|North Star]], Osborne, Apple, [[Zenith Data Systems|Heath]] [[hard sector]] and [[soft sector]], and [[Superbrain]], and one 8-inch version.<ref name=\"byte198212\"/> Ellis Computing also offered its software for both Heath formats, and 16 other 5.25-inch formats including two different TRS-80 CP/M modifications.<ref name=\"byte198312\"/>\n\nCertain disk formats were more popular than others. Most software was available in the Xerox 820 format, and other computers such as the Kaypro II were compatible with it.<ref name=\"derfler19821018\"/><ref name=\"byte198309\"/> No single manufacturer, however, prevailed in the 5.25-inch era of CP/M use, and disk formats were often not portable between hardware manufacturers. A software manufacturer had to prepare a separate version of the program for each brand of hardware on which it was to run. With some manufacturers (Kaypro is an example), there was not even standardization across the company's different models. Because of this situation, disk format translation programs, which allowed a machine to read many different formats, became popular and reduced the confusion, as did programs like Kermit which allowed transfer of data and programs from one machine to another using the [[RS-232|serial]] ports that most CP/M machines had.\n\nVarious formats were used depending on the characteristics of particular systems and to some degree the choices of the designers. CP/M supported options to control the size of reserved and directory areas on the disk, and the mapping between logical disk sectors (as seen by CP/M programs) and physical sectors as allocated on the disk. There were many ways to customize these parameters for every system<ref name=\"Johnson-Laird_1983\"/> but once they had been set, no standardized way existed for a system to load parameters from a disk formatted on another system.\n\nThe degree of portability between different CP/M machines depended on the type of disk drive and controller used since many different floppy types existed in the CP/M era in both 8-inch and 5.25-inch format. Disks could be hard or soft sectored, single or double density, single or double sided, 35 track, 40 track, 77 track, or 80 track, and the sector layout, size and interleave could vary widely as well. Although translation programs could allow the user to read disk types from different machines, it also depended on the drive type and controller. By 1982, soft sector, single sided, 40 track 5.25-inch disks had become the most popular format to distribute CP/M software on as they were used by the most common consumer-level machines of that time such as the Apple II, TRS-80, Osborne 1, Kaypro II, and IBM PC. A translation program allowed the user to read any disks on his machine that had a similar format\u2014for example, the Kaypro II could read [[TRS-80]], [[Osborne 1|Osborne]], [[IBM PC]], and [[Epson QX-10|Epson]] disks. Other disk types such as 80 track or hard sectored were completely impossible to read. The first half of double sided disks (like the Epson QX-10's) could be read because CP/M accessed disk tracks sequentially with track 0 being the first (outermost) track of side 1 and track 79 (on a 40 track disk) being the last (innermost) track of side 2. Apple II users could not use anything but Apple's GCR format and so had to obtain CP/M software on Apple format disks or else transfer it via serial link.\n\nThe fragmented CP/M market, requiring distributors either to stock multiple formats of disks or to invest in multiformat duplication equipment, compared with the more standardized [[IBM PC]] disk formats, was a contributing factor to the rapid obsolescence of CP/M after 1981.\n\nOne of the last notable CP/M capable machines to appear was the [[Commodore&nbsp;128]] in 1985, which had a Z80 for CP/M support in addition to its native mode using a 6502-derivative CPU. Using CP/M required either a [[Commodore 1571|1571]] or [[Commodore 1581|1581]] disk drive which could read soft sector 40 track [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] format disks.\n\nThe first computer to use a 3.5-inch floppy drive, the [[Sony SMC-70]],<ref name=\"Sony-SMC-70\"/> ran CP/M&nbsp;2.2. The [[Commodore 128]], [[Bondwell-2]] laptop, Micromint/Ciarcia SB-180,<ref name=\"Ciarcia_1985\"/> [[MSX]] and [[TRS-80 Model&nbsp;4]] (running Montezuma CP/M&nbsp;2.2) also supported the use of CP/M with 3.5-inch floppy disks. The [[Amstrad PCW]] ran CP/M using 3 inch floppy drives at first, and later switched to the 3.5 inch drives.\n\n====Graphics====\n[[File:MBasic 5.21.jpg|thumb|[[MBASIC]] text output displayed on a monochrome monitor typical for that time.]]\nAlthough graphics-capable S-100 systems existed from the commercialization of the [[S-100 bus]], CP/M did not provide any standardized graphics support until 1982 with [[Graphics System Extension|GSX]] (Graphics System Extension). Owing to the small memory available, graphics was never a common feature associated with 8-bit CP/M operating systems. Most systems could only display rudimentary [[ASCII art]] charts and diagrams in [[text mode]] or by using a custom [[character set]]. Some computers in the [[Kaypro#Kaypro computers|Kaypro]] line and the [[TRS-80 Model 4]] had video hardware supporting block graphics characters, and these were accessible to assembler programmers and BASIC programmers using the CHR$ command. The Model 4 could display 640 by 240 pixel graphics with an optional high resolution board.\n\n===Multi-user===\n{{main|MP/M}}\nIn 1979, a multi-user compatible derivative of CP/M was released. [[MP/M]] allowed multiple users to connect to a single computer, using multiple [[computer terminal|terminals]] to provide each user with a screen and keyboard.  Later versions ran on 16-bit processors.\n\n==={{anchor|3.0}}CP/M Plus===\n[[File:CP-M Plus System Guide.jpg|thumb|right|CP/M Plus (CP/M 3) System Guide]]\nThe last 8-bit version of CP/M was version 3, often called CP/M&nbsp;Plus, released in 1983. It incorporated the bank switching memory management of [[MP/M]] in a single-user single-task operating system compatible with CP/M&nbsp;2.2 applications. CP/M&nbsp;3 could therefore use more than 64&nbsp;KB of memory on an 8080 or Z80 processor. The system could be configured to support date stamping of files. The operating system distribution software also included a relocating assembler and linker.<ref name=\"Mann83\"/> CP/M&nbsp;3 was available for the last generation of 8-bit computers, notably the [[Amstrad PCW]], the [[Amstrad CPC]], the [[ZX Spectrum +3]], the [[Commodore 128]], [[MSX]] machines and the [[Radio Shack]] [[TRS-80 Model 4]].<ref name=\"Radio_Shack_1985\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|CP/M-68K|CP/M-8000|Portable CP/M|GEMDOS}}The 16-bit world===\n[[File:PRO CPM-80.jpg|thumb|right|DEC PRO-CP/M-80 floppy disk distribution for the Z80-A co-processor in a DEC Professional 3xx series.]]\nThere were versions of CP/M for some [[16-bit]] CPUs as well.\n\nThe first version in the 16-bit family was [[CP/M-86]] for the [[Intel 8086]] in November 1981.<ref name=\"Digital_Research_1981_News\"/> At this point, the original [[8-bit]] CP/M became known by the [[retronym]] '''CP/M-80''' to avoid confusion.<ref name=\"Digital_Research_1981_News\"/>\n\nCP/M-86 was expected to be the standard operating system of the new [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PCs]], but DRI and [[IBM]] were unable to negotiate development and licensing terms. IBM turned to Microsoft instead, and Microsoft delivered [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] based on [[86-DOS]]. Although CP/M-86 became an option for the IBM PC after DRI threatened legal action, it never overtook Microsoft's system. Most customers were repelled by the significantly greater price IBM charged for CP/M-86 over PC DOS ({{currency|amount=240|code=USD|linked=yes}} and {{currency|amount=40|code=USD|linked=no}}, respectively).<ref name=\"Maher_2017\"/>\n\nWhen [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) put out the [[Rainbow 100]] to compete with IBM, it came with CP/M-80 using a Z80 chip, CP/M-86 or MS-DOS using an 8088 microprocessor, or [[CP/M-86/80]] using both. The Z80 and 8088 CPUs ran concurrently.<ref name=\"Kildall_1982_8-bit\"/><ref name=\"snyder198306\"/> A benefit of the Rainbow was that it could continue to run 8-bit CP/M software, preserving a user's possibly sizable investment as they moved into the 16-bit world of MS-DOS.<ref name=\"Kildall_1982_8-bit\"/> A similar [[multiprocessing|dual-processor]] adaption for the {{ill|CompuPro System 816|sr|Compupro System 816}} was named [[CP/M 8-16]]. The CP/M-86 adaptation for the 8085/8088-based [[Zenith Z-100]] also supported running programs for both of its CPUs.\n\nSoon following CP/M-86, another 16-bit version of CP/M was '''CP/M-68K''' for the [[Motorola 68000]]. The original version of CP/M-68K in 1982 was written in [[Pascal/MT+68k]], but it was ported to C later on. CP/M-68K, already running on the Motorola [[EXORmacs]] systems, was initially to be used in the [[Atari ST]] computer, but Atari decided to go with a newer disk operating system called [[GEMDOS]]. CP/M-68K was also used on the SORD M68 and M68MX computers.<ref name=\"M68\"/>\n\nIn 1982 there was also a port from CP/M-68K to the 16-bit [[Zilog Z8000]] for the [[Olivetti M20]], written in [[C (language)|C]], named '''CP/M-8000'''.<ref name=\"Thomas_1981_CPM\"/><ref name=\"Olmstead\"/>\n\nThese 16-bit versions of CP/M required application programs to be re-compiled for the new CPUs or if they were written in [[assembly language]], to be [[assembly language translator|translated]] using tools like Digital Research's [[XLT86]], a program written by Gary Kildall in 1981, which translated .ASM source code for the Intel 8080 processor into .A86 source code for the Intel 8086. Using global data flow analysis on 8080 register usage, the translator would also optimize the output for code size and take care of calling conventions, so that [[CP/M-80]] and [[MP/M-80]] programs could be ported to the [[CP/M-86]] and [[MP/M-86]] platforms automatically. XLT86 itself was written in [[PL/I-80]] and was available for CP/M-80 platforms as well as for [[DEC VMS]] (for [[VAX 11/750]] or [[VAX 11/780|11/780]]).<ref name=\"DR_1981_XLT\"/>\n\n===MS-DOS takes over===\nMany expected that CP/M would be the standard operating system for 16-bit computers.<ref name=\"pournelle198403\"/> In 1980 IBM approached Digital Research, at [[Bill Gates]]' suggestion,<ref name=\"Isaacson_2014\"/> to license a forthcoming version of CP/M for its new product, the [[IBM Personal Computer]]. Upon the failure to obtain a signed [[non-disclosure agreement]], the talks failed, and IBM instead contracted with Microsoft to provide an operating system.<ref name=\"Bellis_2010\"/> The resulting product, [[MS-DOS]], soon began outselling CP/M.\n\nMany of the basic concepts and mechanisms of early versions of MS-DOS resembled those of CP/M. Internals like file-handling data structures were identical, and both referred to disk drives with a letter (<code>A:</code>, <code>B:</code>, etc.). MS-DOS's main innovation was its [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] [[file system]]. This similarity made it easier to port popular CP/M software like [[WordStar]] and [[dBase]]. However, CP/M's concept of separate user areas for files on the same disk was never ported to MS-DOS. Since MS-DOS had access to more memory (as few IBM PCs were sold with less than 64&nbsp;KB of memory, while CP/M could run in 16&nbsp;KB if necessary), more commands were built into the [[command.com|command-line shell]], making MS-DOS somewhat faster and easier to use on floppy-based computers.\n\nAlthough one of the first peripherals for the IBM PC was a SoftCard-like expansion card that let it run 8-bit CP/M software,<ref name=\"magid1982febmar\"/> CP/M rapidly lost market share as the microcomputing market moved to the IBM-compatible platform, and it never regained its former popularity. ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' magazine, at the time one of the leading industry magazines for microcomputers, essentially ceased covering CP/M products within a few years of the introduction of the IBM PC. For example, in 1983 there were still a few advertisements for S-100 boards and articles on CP/M software, but by 1987 these were no longer found in the magazine. A 1984 article in ''InfoWorld'' stated that efforts to introduce CP/M to the home market had been largely unsuccessful and most CP/M software was too expensive for home users,<ref name=\"Mace_1984\"/> and in 1986 stated that Kaypro had stopped production of their 8-bit CP/M-based models to concentrate on sales of MS-DOS compatible systems, long after most other vendors had ceased production of new equipment and software for CP/M.<ref name=\"Groth_1986\"/>\n\nLater versions of CP/M-86 made significant strides in performance and usability and were made compatible with MS-DOS. To reflect this compatibility the name was changed, and CP/M-86 became [[DOS Plus]], which in turn became [[DR-DOS]].\n\n===ZCPR===\nZCPR<ref name=\"ZCPR\"/> (the Z80 Command Processor Replacement) was introduced on 2 February 1982 as a drop-in replacement for the standard Digital Research console command processor (CCP) and was initially written by a group of computer hobbyists who called themselves \"The CCP Group\". They were Frank Wancho, Keith Petersen (the archivist behind [[Simtel]] at the time), Ron Fowler, Charlie Strom, Bob Mathias, and Richard Conn. Richard was, in fact, the driving force in this group (all of whom maintained contact through email).\n\nZCPR1 was released on a disk put out by SIG/M (Special Interest Group/Microcomputers), a part of the Amateur Computer Club of [[New Jersey]].\n\nZCPR2 was released on 14 February 1983. It was released as a set of ten disks from SIG/M. ZCPR2 was upgraded to 2.3, and also was released in 8080 code, permitting the use of ZCPR2 on 8080 and 8085 systems.\n\nZCPR3<ref name=\"ZCPR3\"/> was released on 14 July 1984, as a set of nine disks from SIG/M. The code for ZCPR3 could also be compiled (with reduced features) for the 8080 and would run on systems that did not have the requisite [[Z80]] microprocessor.\n\nIn January 1987, Richard Conn stopped developing ZCPR, and Echelon asked Jay Sage (who already had a privately enhanced ZCPR 3.1) to continue work on it. Thus, ZCPR 3.3 was developed and released. ZCPR 3.3 no longer supported the 8080 series of microprocessors, and added the most features of any upgrade in the ZCPR line.\n\nFeatures of ZCPR as of version 3 included:\n* shells\n* aliases\n* I/O redirection\n* flow control\n* named directories\n* search paths\n* custom menus\n* passwords\n* on line help\n\nZCPR3.3 also included a full complement of utilities with considerably extended capabilities.

[\u2026] [ In 1976, [[Glenn Ewing]] approached me with a problem: [[IMSAI|Imsai]], Incorporated, for whom Glenn consulted, had shipped a large number of disk subsystems with a promise that an operating system would follow. I was somewhat reluctant to adapt CP/M to yet another controller, and thus the notion of a separated Basic I/O System (BIOS) evolved. In principle, the hardware dependent portions of CP/M were concentrated in the BIOS, thus allowing Glenn, or anyone else, to adapt CP/M to the Imsai equipment. Imsai was subsequently licensed to distribute [[CP/M 1.3|CP/M version 1.3]] which eventually evolved into an operating system called [[IMDOS]].

However, the sale was not to be, and the rest, as they say, is history. Kathryn [\u2026] continued to write code for new versions of CP/M. She worked on CP/M 2.0 and CP/M +. She made many contributions to CP/M 2.2 (the largest money spinner for DRI) including a background spooler for printing (simple multi-tasking) and system guides. In fact, in one book, Kathryn is called \"the mother of CP/M 2.2,\" for the hundreds and hundreds of hours she put in with Dave Brown, John Pierce, Bob Silberstein, and others, perfecting Kildall's original design. Kathryn was also the project manager for CP/M-86 and Concurrent CP/M-86. [\u2026] \"They Made America,\" [\u2026] paperback version.

standing for '''Control Program/Monitor'''<ref name=\"Kildall.NYT\"/> and later '''Control Program for Microcomputers''',<ref name=\"Shustek_2016\"/><ref name=\"Kildall_1993\"/><ref name=\"Newton_2000\"/> is a mass-market [[operating system]] created in 1974 for [[Intel 8080]]/[[Intel 8085|85]]-based [[microcomputer]]s by [[Gary Kildall]] of [[Digital Research, Inc.]] Initially confined to single-tasking on [[8-bit processor]]s and no more than 64 [[kilobyte]]s of memory, later versions of CP/M added multi-user variations and were migrated to [[16-bit processor]]s.\n\nThe combination of CP/M and [[S-100 bus]] computers was loosely patterned on the [[Altair 8800|MITS Altair]], an early standard in the microcomputer industry. This [[computer platform]] was widely used in business through the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s.<ref name=\"Compupro816\"/> CP/M increased the market size for both hardware and software by greatly reducing the amount of programming required to install an application on a new manufacturer's computer.<ref name=\"InfoWorld May 1981\"/><ref name=\"InfoWorld July 1982\"/> An important driver of software innovation was the advent of (comparatively) low-cost microcomputers running CP/M, as independent programmers and [[hacker (hobbyist)|hackers]] bought them and shared their creations in [[user group]]s.<ref name=\"Commodore_128\"/> CP/M was displaced by [[DOS]] soon after the 1981 introduction of the [[IBM PC]].\n\n==Hardware model==\n[[File:Sanco 8001.jpg|thumb|right|Sanco 8001 computer, running under CP/M 2.2 (1982).]]\n[[File:Commodore CP-M cartridge for the C64 (main).jpg|thumb|right|CP/M cartridge for the [[Commodore 64]].]]\nA minimal 8-bit CP/M system would contain the following components:\n* A [[computer terminal]] using the [[ASCII]] character set\n* An Intel 8080 (and later the 8085) or [[Zilog Z80]] microprocessor\n** The [[NEC V20]] and [[NEC V30|V30]] processors support an 8080-emulation mode that can run 8-bit CP/M on a PC&nbsp;DOS/MS-DOS computer so equipped, though any PC can also run the 16-bit CP/M-86.<ref name=\"CP/M-Emu\"/><ref name=\"Davis_1985_NEC\"/>\n* At least 16 kilobytes of [[Random access memory|RAM]], beginning at address 0\n* A means to [[Bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrap]] the first sector of the diskette\n* At least one [[floppy disk]] drive\n\nThe only hardware system that CP/M, as sold by Digital Research, would support was the Intel 8080 Development System. Manufacturers of CP/M-compatible systems customized portions of the operating system for their own combination of installed memory, disk drives, and console devices. CP/M would also run on systems based on the Zilog Z80 processor since the Z80 was compatible with 8080 code. While the Digital Research distributed core of CP/M (BDOS, CCP, core transient commands) did not use any of the Z80-specific instructions, many Z80-based systems used Z80 code in the system-specific BIOS, and many applications were dedicated to Z80-based CP/M machines.\n\nOn most machines the bootstrap was a minimal [[bootloader]] in [[Read only memory|ROM]] combined with some means of minimal [[bank switching]] or a means of injecting code on the bus (since the 8080 needs to see boot code at Address 0 for start-up, while CP/M needs RAM there); for others, this bootstrap had to be entered into memory using [[front panel|front-panel]] controls each time the system was started.\n\nCP/M used the 7-bit ASCII set. The other 128 characters made possible by the 8-bit byte were not standardized. For example, one [[Kaypro]] used them for Greek characters, and [[Osborne Computer Corporation|Osborne]] machines used the 8th bit set to indicate an underlined character. [[WordStar]] used the 8th bit as an end-of-word marker. International CP/M systems most commonly used the [[ISO 646]] norm for localized character sets, replacing certain ASCII characters with localized characters rather than adding them beyond the 7-bit boundary.\n\n==Components of the operating system==\nIn the 8-bit versions, while running, the CP/M operating system loaded into memory had three components:<ref name=\"CPM.NYT83\"/>\n* ''[[#BIOS|Basic Input/Output System]]'' (BIOS),\n* ''[[#BDOS|Basic Disk Operating System]]'' (BDOS),\n* ''[[#CCP|Console Command Processor]]'' (CCP).\nThe BIOS and BDOS were memory-resident, while the CCP was memory-resident unless overwritten by an application, in which case it was automatically reloaded after the application finished running. A number of transient commands for standard utilities were also provided. The transient commands resided in [[Computer file|files]] with the [[filename extension|extension]] .COM on disk.\n\nThe BIOS directly controlled hardware components other than the CPU and main memory. It contained functions such as character input and output and the reading and writing of disk sectors. The BDOS implemented the CP/M [[file system]] and some input/output abstractions (such as redirection) on top of the BIOS. The CCP took user commands and either executed them directly (internal commands such as DIR to show a directory or ERA to delete a file) or loaded and started an executable file of the given name (transient commands such as PIP.COM to copy files or STAT.COM to show various file and system information). Third-party applications for CP/M were also essentially transient commands.\n\nThe BDOS, CCP and standard transient commands were (ideally) the same in all installations of a particular revision of CP/M, but the BIOS portion was always adapted to the particular hardware. Adding memory to a computer, for example, meant that the CP/M system had to be reinstalled with an updated BIOS capable of addressing the additional memory. A utility was provided to patch the supplied BIOS, BDOS and CCP to allow them to be run from higher memory. Once installed, the operating system (BIOS, BDOS and CCP) was stored in reserved areas at the beginning of any disk which would be used to boot the system. On start-up, the bootloader (usually contained in a ROM firmware chip) would load the operating system from the disk in drive <code>A:</code>.\n\nBy modern standards CP/M was primitive, owing to the extreme constraints on program size. With version 1.0 there was no provision for detecting a changed disk. If a user changed disks without manually rereading the disk directory the system would write on the new disk using the old disk's directory information, ruining the data stored on the disk. From version 1.1 or 1.2 onwards, changing a disk then trying to write to it before its directory was read would cause a fatal error to be signalled. This avoided overwriting the disk but required a reboot and loss of the data that was to be stored on disk.\n\nThe majority of the complexity in CP/M was isolated in the BDOS, and to a lesser extent, the CCP and transient commands. This meant that by porting the limited number of simple routines in the BIOS to a particular hardware platform, the entire OS would work. This significantly reduced the development time needed to support new machines, and was one of the main reasons for CP/M's widespread use. Today this sort of abstraction is common to most OSs (a [[hardware abstraction layer]]), but at the time of CP/M's birth, OSs were typically intended to run on only one machine platform, and multilayer designs were considered unnecessary.\n\n==={{anchor|CCP}}Console Command Processor===\n<!-- This section may be linked to from inside or outside this article. Do not rename without keeping in sync. -->\n[[File:Commodore C128 CPM Screenshot 2 full.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Screenshot showing a CP/M 3.0 directory listing using the <code>[[dir (command)|DIR]]</code> command on a [[Commodore 128]] home computer.]]\nThe Console Command Processor, or CCP, accepted input from the keyboard and conveyed results to the terminal. CP/M itself would work with either a printing terminal or a video terminal. All CP/M commands had to be typed in on the [[command line]]. The console would most often display the <code>A></code> prompt, to indicate the current default disk drive. When used with a video terminal, this would usually be followed by a blinking [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] supplied by the terminal. The CCP would await input from the user.\n\nA CCP internal command, of the form drive letter followed by a colon, could be used to select the default drive. For example, typing <code>B:</code> and pressing enter at the command prompt would change the default drive to B, and the command prompt would then become <code>B></code> to indicate this change.\n\nCP/M's [[command-line interface]] was patterned after the operating systems from [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital Equipment]], such as [[RT-11]] for the [[PDP-11]] and [[OS/8]] for the [[PDP-8]].\n\nCommands took the form of a keyword followed by a list of parameters separated by spaces or special characters. Similar to a Unix [[shell builtin]], if an internal command was recognized, it was carried out by the CCP itself. Otherwise it would attempt to find an executable file on the currently logged disk drive and (in later versions) user area, load it, and pass it any additional parameters from the command line. These were referred to as \"transient\" programs. On completion, CP/M would reload the part of the CCP that had been overwritten by application programs \u2014 this allowed transient programs a larger memory space.\n\nThe commands themselves could sometimes be obscure. For instance, the command to duplicate files was named <code>[[Peripheral Interchange Program|PIP]]</code> (Peripheral-Interchange-Program), the name of the old [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] utility used for that purpose. The format of parameters given to a program was not standardized, so that there was no single option character that differentiated options from file names. Different programs could and did use different characters.\n\n===={{anchor|MOVCPM}}Commands====\nThe following list of [[Shell builtin|built-in]] [[command (computing)|commands]] are supported by the CP/M Console Command Processor:<ref name=\"CPM22\"/>\n* [[DIR (CP/M command)|DIR]]\n* [[ERA (CP/M command)|ERA]]\n* [[REN (CP/M command)|REN]]\n* [[SAVE (CP/M command)|SAVE]]\n* [[TYPE (CP/M command)|TYPE]]\n* [[USER (CP/M command)|USER]]\n\nTransient commands in CP/M include:<ref name=\"CPM22\"/>\n* [[Assembler (computing)|ASM]]\n* [[DDT (CP/M command)|DDT]]\n* [[DUMP (CP/M command)|DUMP]]\n* [[ED (CP/M command)|ED]]\n* [[LOAD (CP/M command)|LOAD]]\n* {{ill|MOVCPM|pl|MOVCPM (CP/M)}}\n* [[PIP (CP/M command)|PIP]]\n* [[STAT (CP/M command)|STAT]]\n* [[SUBMIT (CP/M command)|SUBMIT]]\n* [[SYSGEN (CP/M command)|SYSGEN]]\n\nCP/M Plus (CP/M Version 3) includes the following built-in commands:<ref name=\"CPM3_1983_PG\"/>\n* DIR \u2013 display list of files from a directory except those marked with the SYS attribute\n* [[DIRSYS (CP/M command)|DIRSYS]] \u2013 list files marked with the SYS attribute in the directory\n* [[ERASE (CP/M command)|ERASE]] \u2013 delete a file\n* [[RENAME (CP/M command)|RENAME]] \u2013 rename a file\n* TYPE \u2013 display contents of an ASCII character file\n* USER \u2013 change user number\n\n==={{anchor|BDOS}}Basic Disk Operating System===\n<!-- This section may be linked to from inside or outside this article. Do not rename without keeping in sync. -->\nThe Basic Disk Operating System,<ref name=\"Kildall_1975_BDOS\"/><ref name=\"Kildall_1980_CPM\"/> or BDOS,<ref name=\"Kildall_1975_BDOS\"/><ref name=\"Kildall_1980_CPM\"/> provided access to such operations as opening a file, output to the console, or printing. Application programs would load processor registers with a function code for the operation, and addresses for parameters or memory buffers, and call a fixed address in memory. Since the address was the same independent of the amount of memory in the system, application programs would run the same way for any type or configuration of hardware.\n\n==={{anchor|BIOS}}Basic Input Output System===\n[[File:CP\u2044M Ad, Dec 11, 1978.png|thumbnail|right|CP/M advertisement in the 11 December 1978, issue of ''[[InfoWorld]]'' magazine]]\n<!-- This section may be linked to from inside or outside this article. Do not rename without keeping in sync. -->\n<!-- These two sources are not currently used inhere, but may become useful in the future:<ref name=\"Fischer_2001_Ewing\"/><ref name=\"Fraley_2007_Killian\"/> -->\nThe Basic Input Output System,<ref name=\"Kildall_1975_BDOS\"/><ref name=\"Kildall_1980_CPM\"/> or BIOS,<ref name=\"Kildall_1975_BDOS\"/><ref name=\"Kildall_1980_CPM\"/> provided the lowest level functions required by the operating system.\n\nThese included reading or writing single characters to the system console and reading or writing a sector of data from the disk. The BDOS handled some of the buffering of data from the diskette, but before CP/M&nbsp;3.0 it assumed a disk sector size fixed at 128 bytes, as used on [[single-density]] 8-inch floppy disks. Since most 5.25-inch disk formats used larger sectors, the blocking and deblocking and the management of a disk buffer area was handled by model-specific code in the BIOS.\n\nCustomization was required because hardware choices were not constrained by compatibility with any one popular standard. For example, some manufacturers used a separate computer terminal, while others designed a built-in integrated video display system. Serial ports for printers and modems could use different types of [[UART]] chips, and port addresses were not fixed. Some machines used memory-mapped I/O instead of the 8080 I/O address space. All of these variations in the hardware were concealed from other modules of the system by use of the BIOS, which used standard entry points for the services required to run CP/M such as character I/O or accessing a disk block. Since support for serial communication to a modem was very rudimentary in the BIOS or may have been absent altogether, it was common practice for CP/M programs that used modems to have a user-installed overlay containing all the code required to access a particular machine's serial port.\n\n==={{anchor|FDOS|2.2}}File system===\nFile names were specified as a string of up to eight characters, followed by a period, followed by a file name extension of up to three characters ([[8.3 filename|\"8.3\" filename format]]). The extension usually identified the type of the file. For example, <code>.COM</code> indicated an executable program file, and <code>.TXT</code> indicated a file containing [[ASCII]] text.\n\nEach disk drive was identified by a [[drive letter]], for example drive <code>A</code> and drive <code>B</code>. To refer to a file on a specific drive, the drive letter was prefixed to the file name, separated by a colon, e.g. <code>A:FILE.TXT</code>. With no drive letter prefixed, access was to files on the current default drive.<ref name=\"px4\"/>\n\nThe \"8.3\" filename format and the drive letter + colon combination survived into MS-DOS. The drive letter + colon convention has survived in [[Microsoft Windows]] and is still used today. In addition, file extensions (for example, <code>[[.txt]]</code>, <code>[[COM file|.com]]</code> (a [[compiled]] file), or <code>[[.exe]]</code> (an [[executable]] file)) are still used to identify file types on many operating systems.\n\nFile size was specified as the number of 128 byte ''records'' (directly corresponding to disk sectors on 8-inch drives) occupied by a file on the disk. There was no generally supported way of specifying byte-exact file sizes. The current size of a file was maintained in the file's [[File Control Block]] (FCB) by the operating system. Since many application programs (such as [[text editors]]) prefer to deal with files as sequences of characters rather than as sequences of records, by convention text files were terminated with a [[control-Z]] character ([[ASCII]] [[Substitute character|SUB]], [[hexadecimal]] 1A). Determining the [[End-of-file|end]] of a [[text file]] therefore involved examining the last record of the file to locate the terminating control-Z. This also meant that inserting a control-Z character into the middle of a file usually had the effect of truncating the text contents of the file.\n\nWith the advent of larger removable and fixed disk drives, disk de-blocking formulas were employed which resulted in more disk blocks per logical file allocation block. While this allowed for larger file sizes, it also meant that the smallest file which could be allocated increased in size from 1&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] (on single-density drives) to 2&nbsp;KB (on double-density drives) and so on, up to 32&nbsp;KB for a file containing only a single byte. This made for inefficient use of disk space if the disk contained a large number of small files.\n\nFile modification [[system time|time stamps]] were not supported in releases up to CP/M&nbsp;2.2, but were an optional feature in [[MP/M]] and CP/M&nbsp;3.0.\n\nCP/M&nbsp;2.2 had no subdirectories in the file structure, but provided 16 numbered user areas to organize files on a disk. To change user one had to simply type \"User X\" at the command prompt, X being the number of the user wanted; security was non-existent and not believed to be necessary. The user area concept was to make the single-user version of CP/M somewhat compatible with multi-user MP/M systems. A common patch for the CP/M and derivative operating systems was to make one user area accessible to the user independent of the currently set user area. A USER command allowed the user area to be changed to any area from 0 to 15. User 0 was the default. If one changed to another user, such as USER 1, the material saved on the disk for this user would only be available to USER 1; USER 2 would not be able to see it or access it. However, files stored in the USER 0 area were accessible to all other users; their location was specified with a prefatory [[Path (computing)|path]], since the files of USER 0 were only visible to someone logged in as USER 0. The user area feature arguably had little utility on small floppy disks, but it was useful for organizing files on machines with [[hard drive]]s. The intent of the feature was to ease use of the same computer for different tasks. For example, a secretary could do [[data entry clerk|data entry]], then, after switching USER areas, another employee could use the machine to do [[Invoice|billing]] without their files intermixing.\n\n==={{anchor|TPA}}Transient Program Area===\nThe read/write memory between address 0100 hexadecimal and the lowest address of the BDOS was the ''Transient Program Area'' (TPA) available for CP/M application programs. Although all Z80 and 8080 processors could address 64 kilobytes of memory, the amount available for application programs could vary, depending on the design of the particular computer. Some computers used large parts of the address space for such things as BIOS ROMs, or video display memory. As a result, some systems had more TPA memory available than others. Bank switching was a common technique that allowed systems to have a large TPA while switching out ROM or video memory space as needed. CP/M&nbsp;3.0 allowed parts of the BDOS to be in bank-switched memory as well.\n\n===Debugging application===\nCP/M came with a Dynamic Debugging Tool, nicknamed [[Dynamic debugging technique|DDT]] (after the insecticide, i.e. a [[Software bug|bug]]-killer), which allowed memory and program modules to be examined and manipulated, and allowed a program to be executed one step at a time.<ref name=\"DDT1\"/><ref name=\"DDT2\"/><ref name=\"DDT3\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|RSX|RSM}}Resident programs===\nCP/M originally did not support the equivalent of [[terminate and stay resident]] (TSR) programs as under DOS. Programmers could write software that could intercept certain operating system calls and extend or alter their functionality. Using this capability, programmers developed and sold auxiliary [[desk accessory]] programs, such as [[SmartKey]], a keyboard utility to assign any string of bytes to any key.<ref name=\"Software_Catalog_1984\"/>\nCP/M&nbsp;3, however, added support for [[dynamic loading|dynamically loadable]] ''Resident System Extensions'' (RSX).<ref name=\"CPM3_1983_PG\"/> Similar solutions like RSMs (for ''Resident System Modules'') were also retrofitted to CP/M&nbsp;2.2 systems by third-parties.<ref name=\"ct_1\"/><ref name=\"ct_2\"/><ref name=\"Huck_2016\"/>\n\n===Installation===\nAlthough CP/M provided some [[hardware abstraction]] to standardize the interface to disk I/O or console I/O, typically application programs still required installation to make use of all the features of such equipment as printers and terminals. Often these were controlled by [[escape sequence]]s which had to be altered for different devices. For example, the escape sequence to select bold face on a printer would have differed among manufacturers, and sometimes among models within a manufacturer's range. This procedure was not defined by the operating system; a user would typically run an installation program that would either allow selection from a range of devices, or else allow feature-by-feature editing of the escape sequences required to access a function. This had to be repeated for each application program, since there was no central operating system service provided for these devices.\n\nThe initializing codes for each model of printer had to be written into the application. To use a program such as Wordstar with more than one printer (say, a fast dot matrix printer or a slower but presentation-quality [[daisy wheel]] printer), a separate version of Wordstar had to be prepared, and one had to load the Wordstar version that corresponded to the printer selected (and exiting and reloading to change printers).\n\n==History==\n[[File:CP\u2044M Ad, InfoWorld, November 29, 1982.jpg|thumbnail|right|CP/M advertisement in the 29 November 1982 issue of ''[[InfoWorld]]'' magazine]]\n==={{anchor|1.0|1.1|1.2|1.3|1.4}}The beginning and CP/M's heyday===\n[[Gary Kildall]] originally developed CP/M during 1974,<ref name=\"Shustek_2016\"/><ref name=\"Kildall_1993\"/> as an operating system to run on an [[Intel]] [[Intellec|Intellec-8]] development system, equipped with a [[Shugart Associates]] 8-inch [[floppy disk drive]] interfaced via a custom [[floppy disk controller]].<ref name=\"Kildall_1980_CPM\"/> It was written in Kildall's own [[PL/M]] (''[[Programming Language]] for Microcomputers'').<ref name=\"Kildall_1975_BDOS\"/> Various aspects of CP/M were influenced by the [[TOPS-10]] operating system of the [[DECsystem-10]] [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computer, which Kildall had used as a development environment.<ref name=\"johnson\"/><ref name=\"Dr. Dobb's Journal Apr 1976\"/><ref name=\"Digital Research (Firm)\"/>\n\n====The name====\nCP/M originally stood for \"Control Program/Monitor\",<ref name=\"CPM.NYT83\"/> a name which implies a [[resident monitor]]\u2014a primitive precursor to the operating system. However, during the conversion of CP/M to a commercial product, trademark registration documents filed in November 1977 gave the product's name as \"Control Program for Microcomputers\".<ref name=\"Kildall_1993\"/> The CP/M name follows a prevailing naming scheme of the time, as in Kildall's PL/M language, and Prime Computer's [[PL/P]] (''Programming Language for Prime''), both suggesting IBM's [[PL/I]]; and IBM's [[CP/CMS]] operating system, which Kildall had used when working at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] (NPS).\n\nThis renaming of CP/M was part of a larger effort by Kildall and his wife/business partner, Dorothy McEwen<ref name=\"Kildall.NYT\"/> to convert Kildall's personal project of CP/M and the Intel-contracted PL/M compiler into a commercial enterprise. The Kildalls intended to establish the Digital Research brand and its product lines as synonymous with \"microcomputer\" in the consumer's mind, similar to what IBM and Microsoft together later successfully accomplished in making \"personal computer\" synonymous with their product offerings.\n\nIntergalactic Digital Research, Inc. was later renamed via a corporation change-of-name filing to Digital Research, Inc.<ref name=\"Kildall.NYT\"/>\n\n====Portability====\nBy September 1981 Digital Research had sold more than {{val|250000}} CP/M licenses; ''[[InfoWorld]]'' stated that the actual market was likely larger because of sublicenses. Many different companies produced CP/M-based computers for many different markets; the magazine stated that \"CP/M is well on its way to establishing itself as ''the'' small-computer operating system\".{{r|hogan19810914state}}\nThe companies chose to support CP/M because of its large library of software. The [[Xerox 820]] ran the operating system because \"where there are literally thousands of programs written for it, it would be unwise not to take advantage of it\", Xerox said.<ref name=\"wise19820510\"/> (Xerox included a [[Howard W. Sams]] CP/M manual as compensation for Digital Research's documentation, which ''InfoWorld'' in 1982 described as atrocious.<ref name=\"meyer19820614\"/>) By 1984 [[Columbia University]] used the same source code to build [[Kermit (protocol)|Kermit]] binaries for more than a dozen different CP/M systems, plus a generic version.<ref name=\"dacruz19840427\"/> The operating system was described as a \"[[software bus]]\", allowing multiple programs to interact with different hardware in a standardized way.<ref name=\"Swaine_1997_Entrepreneurship\"/> Programs written for CP/M were typically portable among different machines, usually requiring only the specification of the [[escape sequence]]s for control of the [[computer terminal|screen]] and printer. This portability made CP/M popular, and much more software was written for CP/M than for operating systems that ran on only one brand of hardware. One restriction on portability was that certain programs used the extended instruction set of the Z80 processor and would not operate on an 8080 or 8085 processor. Another was graphics routines, especially in games and graphics programs, which were generally machine-specific as they used direct hardware access for speed, bypassing the OS and BIOS (this was also a common problem in early DOS machines).{{citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=Certainly a common problem for DOS programs, but CP/M programs typically were more configurable and thus less machine-specific. Therefore this needs to be sourced by a RS.}}\n\n[[File:M Karte.JPG|thumb|right|Apple ''CP/M Card'' with manual]]\n[[Bill Gates]] claimed that the [[Apple II family]] with a [[Z-80 SoftCard]] was the single most-popular CP/M hardware platform.<ref name=\"bunnell19820203\"/> Many different brands of machines ran the operating system, some notable examples being the [[Altair 8800]], the [[IMSAI 8080]], the [[Osborne 1]] and Kaypro [[luggable]]s, and [[MSX]] computers. The best-selling CP/M-capable system of all time was probably the [[Amstrad PCW]]. In the UK, CP/M was also available on [[Research Machines]] educational computers (with the CP/M source code published as an educational resource), and for the [[BBC Micro]] when equipped with a Z80 co-processor. Furthermore, it was available for the [[Amstrad CPC]] series, the [[Commodore 128]], [[TRS-80]], and later models of the [[ZX Spectrum]]. CP/M&nbsp;3 was also used on the [[NIAT]], a custom handheld computer designed for [[A.C. Nielsen]]'s internal use with 1&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]] of [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] memory.\n\n====Applications====\n[[File:Wordstar 4 CPM.jpg|thumb|right|Distribution 5 1/4 inch diskettes and packaging for the last version (Version 4) of [[WordStar]] word processing program released for 8-bit CP/M.]]\n[[WordStar]], one of the first widely used [[word processor]]s, and [[dBase]], an early and popular database program for microcomputers, were originally written for CP/M. Two early [[outliner]]s, [[KAMAS (program)|KAMAS]] (Knowledge and Mind Amplification System) and its cut-down successor Out-Think (without programming facilities and retooled for 8080/V20 compatibility) were also written for CP/M, though later rewritten for MS-DOS. [[Turbo Pascal]], the ancestor of [[Borland Delphi]], and [[Multiplan]], the ancestor of [[Microsoft Excel]], also debuted on CP/M before MS-DOS versions became available. [[Visicalc]], the first-ever spreadsheet program, was made available for CP/M. Another company, [[Sorcim]], created its [[SuperCalc]] spreadsheet for CP/M, which would go on to become the market leader and de facto standard on CP/M. Supercalc would go on to be a competitor in the spreadsheet market in the MS-DOS world. [[AutoCAD]], a CAD application from Autodesk debuted on CP/M. A host of compilers and interpreters for popular [[programming language]]s of the time (such as [[BASIC]], [[Borland]]'s [[Turbo Pascal]], [[FORTRAN]] and even [[PL/I]]<ref name=\"PL1\"/>) were available, among them several of the earliest [[Microsoft]] products.\n\nCP/M software often came with [[installer]]s that adapted it to a wide variety of computers.<ref name=\"mace19840109_16\"/> The source code for BASIC programs was easily accessible, and most forms of [[copy protection]] were ineffective on the operating system.<ref name=\"pournelle198306\"/> A Kaypro II owner, for example, would obtain software on Xerox 820 format, then copy it to and run it from Kaypro-format disks.{{r|derfler19821018}}\n\nThe lack of standardized graphics support limited [[video games]], but various character and text-based games were [[ported]], such as ''[[Telengard]]'',<ref name=\"loguidice20120728\"/> ''[[Gorillas (video game)|Gorillas]]'',<ref name=\"githubgorilla001\"/> ''[[Hamurabi (video game)|Hamurabi]]'', ''[[Lunar Lander (video game series)|Lunar Lander]]'', along with early [[interactive fiction]] including the [[Zork]] series and ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]''. A [[text adventure]] specialist, [[Infocom]] was one of the few publishers to consistently release their games in CP/M format. [[Lifeboat Associates]] started collecting and distributing user-written \"free\" software. One of the first was [[XMODEM]], which allowed reliable file transfers via [[modem]] and phone line. Another program native to CP/M was the [[outline processor]] [[KAMAS (program)|KAMAS]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n====Disk formats====\n[[IBM System/34]] and [[IBM 3740]]'s single-density, single-sided format is CP/M's standard 8-inch [[floppy disk format]]. No standard 5.25-inch CP/M disk format exists, with Kaypro, [[Morrow Designs]], Osborne, and others using their own.<ref name=\"pournelle198204\"/>{{r|meyer19820614}}<ref name=\"128book\"/> ''InfoWorld'' estimated in September 1981 that \"about two dozen formats were popular enough that software creators had to consider them to reach the broadest possible market\".<ref name=\"hogan19810914state\"/> [[JRT Pascal]], for example, provided versions on 5.25-inch disk for [[North Star Computers|North Star]], Osborne, Apple, [[Zenith Data Systems|Heath]] [[hard sector]] and [[soft sector]], and [[Superbrain]], and one 8-inch version.<ref name=\"byte198212\"/> Ellis Computing also offered its software for both Heath formats, and 16 other 5.25-inch formats including two different TRS-80 CP/M modifications.<ref name=\"byte198312\"/>\n\nCertain disk formats were more popular than others. Most software was available in the Xerox 820 format, and other computers such as the Kaypro II were compatible with it.<ref name=\"derfler19821018\"/><ref name=\"byte198309\"/> No single manufacturer, however, prevailed in the 5.25-inch era of CP/M use, and disk formats were often not portable between hardware manufacturers. A software manufacturer had to prepare a separate version of the program for each brand of hardware on which it was to run. With some manufacturers (Kaypro is an example), there was not even standardization across the company's different models. Because of this situation, disk format translation programs, which allowed a machine to read many different formats, became popular and reduced the confusion, as did programs like Kermit which allowed transfer of data and programs from one machine to another using the [[RS-232|serial]] ports that most CP/M machines had.\n\nVarious formats were used depending on the characteristics of particular systems and to some degree the choices of the designers. CP/M supported options to control the size of reserved and directory areas on the disk, and the mapping between logical disk sectors (as seen by CP/M programs) and physical sectors as allocated on the disk. There were many ways to customize these parameters for every system<ref name=\"Johnson-Laird_1983\"/> but once they had been set, no standardized way existed for a system to load parameters from a disk formatted on another system.\n\nThe degree of portability between different CP/M machines depended on the type of disk drive and controller used since many different floppy types existed in the CP/M era in both 8-inch and 5.25-inch format. Disks could be hard or soft sectored, single or double density, single or double sided, 35 track, 40 track, 77 track, or 80 track, and the sector layout, size and interleave could vary widely as well. Although translation programs could allow the user to read disk types from different machines, it also depended on the drive type and controller. By 1982, soft sector, single sided, 40 track 5.25-inch disks had become the most popular format to distribute CP/M software on as they were used by the most common consumer-level machines of that time such as the Apple II, TRS-80, Osborne 1, Kaypro II, and IBM PC. A translation program allowed the user to read any disks on his machine that had a similar format\u2014for example, the Kaypro II could read [[TRS-80]], [[Osborne 1|Osborne]], [[IBM PC]], and [[Epson QX-10|Epson]] disks. Other disk types such as 80 track or hard sectored were completely impossible to read. The first half of double sided disks (like the Epson QX-10's) could be read because CP/M accessed disk tracks sequentially with track 0 being the first (outermost) track of side 1 and track 79 (on a 40 track disk) being the last (innermost) track of side 2. Apple II users could not use anything but Apple's GCR format and so had to obtain CP/M software on Apple format disks or else transfer it via serial link.\n\nThe fragmented CP/M market, requiring distributors either to stock multiple formats of disks or to invest in multiformat duplication equipment, compared with the more standardized [[IBM PC]] disk formats, was a contributing factor to the rapid obsolescence of CP/M after 1981.\n\nOne of the last notable CP/M capable machines to appear was the [[Commodore&nbsp;128]] in 1985, which had a Z80 for CP/M support in addition to its native mode using a 6502-derivative CPU. Using CP/M required either a [[Commodore 1571|1571]] or [[Commodore 1581|1581]] disk drive which could read soft sector 40 track [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] format disks.\n\nThe first computer to use a 3.5-inch floppy drive, the [[Sony SMC-70]],<ref name=\"Sony-SMC-70\"/> ran CP/M&nbsp;2.2. The [[Commodore 128]], [[Bondwell-2]] laptop, Micromint/Ciarcia SB-180,<ref name=\"Ciarcia_1985\"/> [[MSX]] and [[TRS-80 Model&nbsp;4]] (running Montezuma CP/M&nbsp;2.2) also supported the use of CP/M with 3.5-inch floppy disks. The [[Amstrad PCW]] ran CP/M using 3 inch floppy drives at first, and later switched to the 3.5 inch drives.\n\n====Graphics====\n[[File:MBasic 5.21.jpg|thumb|[[MBASIC]] text output displayed on a monochrome monitor typical for that time.]]\nAlthough graphics-capable S-100 systems existed from the commercialization of the [[S-100 bus]], CP/M did not provide any standardized graphics support until 1982 with [[Graphics System Extension|GSX]] (Graphics System Extension). Owing to the small memory available, graphics was never a common feature associated with 8-bit CP/M operating systems. Most systems could only display rudimentary [[ASCII art]] charts and diagrams in [[text mode]] or by using a custom [[character set]]. Some computers in the [[Kaypro#Kaypro computers|Kaypro]] line and the [[TRS-80 Model 4]] had video hardware supporting block graphics characters, and these were accessible to assembler programmers and BASIC programmers using the CHR$ command. The Model 4 could display 640 by 240 pixel graphics with an optional high resolution board.\n\n===Multi-user===\n{{main|MP/M}}\nIn 1979, a multi-user compatible derivative of CP/M was released. [[MP/M]] allowed multiple users to connect to a single computer, using multiple [[computer terminal|terminals]] to provide each user with a screen and keyboard.  Later versions ran on 16-bit processors.\n\n==={{anchor|3.0}}CP/M Plus===\n[[File:CP-M Plus System Guide.jpg|thumb|right|CP/M Plus (CP/M 3) System Guide]]\nThe last 8-bit version of CP/M was version 3, often called CP/M&nbsp;Plus, released in 1983. It incorporated the bank switching memory management of [[MP/M]] in a single-user single-task operating system compatible with CP/M&nbsp;2.2 applications. CP/M&nbsp;3 could therefore use more than 64&nbsp;KB of memory on an 8080 or Z80 processor. The system could be configured to support date stamping of files. The operating system distribution software also included a relocating assembler and linker.<ref name=\"Mann83\"/> CP/M&nbsp;3 was available for the last generation of 8-bit computers, notably the [[Amstrad PCW]], the [[Amstrad CPC]], the [[ZX Spectrum +3]], the [[Commodore 128]], [[MSX]] machines and the [[Radio Shack]] [[TRS-80 Model 4]].<ref name=\"Radio_Shack_1985\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|CP/M-68K|CP/M-8000|Portable CP/M|GEMDOS}}The 16-bit world===\n[[File:PRO CPM-80.jpg|thumb|right|DEC PRO-CP/M-80 floppy disk distribution for the Z80-A co-processor in a DEC Professional 3xx series.]]\nThere were versions of CP/M for some [[16-bit]] CPUs as well.\n\nThe first version in the 16-bit family was [[CP/M-86]] for the [[Intel 8086]] in November 1981.<ref name=\"Digital_Research_1981_News\"/> At this point, the original [[8-bit]] CP/M became known by the [[retronym]] '''CP/M-80''' to avoid confusion.<ref name=\"Digital_Research_1981_News\"/>\n\nCP/M-86 was expected to be the standard operating system of the new [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PCs]], but DRI and [[IBM]] were unable to negotiate development and licensing terms. IBM turned to Microsoft instead, and Microsoft delivered [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] based on [[86-DOS]]. Although CP/M-86 became an option for the IBM PC after DRI threatened legal action, it never overtook Microsoft's system. Most customers were repelled by the significantly greater price IBM charged for CP/M-86 over PC DOS ({{currency|amount=240|code=USD|linked=yes}} and {{currency|amount=40|code=USD|linked=no}}, respectively).<ref name=\"Maher_2017\"/>\n\nWhen [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) put out the [[Rainbow 100]] to compete with IBM, it came with CP/M-80 using a Z80 chip, CP/M-86 or MS-DOS using an 8088 microprocessor, or [[CP/M-86/80]] using both. The Z80 and 8088 CPUs ran concurrently.<ref name=\"Kildall_1982_8-bit\"/><ref name=\"snyder198306\"/> A benefit of the Rainbow was that it could continue to run 8-bit CP/M software, preserving a user's possibly sizable investment as they moved into the 16-bit world of MS-DOS.<ref name=\"Kildall_1982_8-bit\"/> A similar [[multiprocessing|dual-processor]] adaption for the {{ill|CompuPro System 816|sr|Compupro System 816}} was named [[CP/M 8-16]]. The CP/M-86 adaptation for the 8085/8088-based [[Zenith Z-100]] also supported running programs for both of its CPUs.\n\nSoon following CP/M-86, another 16-bit version of CP/M was '''CP/M-68K''' for the [[Motorola 68000]]. The original version of CP/M-68K in 1982 was written in [[Pascal/MT+68k]], but it was ported to C later on. CP/M-68K, already running on the Motorola [[EXORmacs]] systems, was initially to be used in the [[Atari ST]] computer, but Atari decided to go with a newer disk operating system called [[GEMDOS]]. CP/M-68K was also used on the SORD M68 and M68MX computers.<ref name=\"M68\"/>\n\nIn 1982 there was also a port from CP/M-68K to the 16-bit [[Zilog Z8000]] for the [[Olivetti M20]], written in [[C (language)|C]], named '''CP/M-8000'''.<ref name=\"Thomas_1981_CPM\"/><ref name=\"Olmstead\"/>\n\nThese 16-bit versions of CP/M required application programs to be re-compiled for the new CPUs or if they were written in [[assembly language]], to be [[assembly language translator|translated]] using tools like Digital Research's [[XLT86]], a program written by Gary Kildall in 1981, which translated .ASM source code for the Intel 8080 processor into .A86 source code for the Intel 8086. Using global data flow analysis on 8080 register usage, the translator would also optimize the output for code size and take care of calling conventions, so that [[CP/M-80]] and [[MP/M-80]] programs could be ported to the [[CP/M-86]] and [[MP/M-86]] platforms automatically. XLT86 itself was written in [[PL/I-80]] and was available for CP/M-80 platforms as well as for [[DEC VMS]] (for [[VAX 11/750]] or [[VAX 11/780|11/780]]).<ref name=\"DR_1981_XLT\"/>\n\n===MS-DOS takes over===\nMany expected that CP/M would be the standard operating system for 16-bit computers.<ref name=\"pournelle198403\"/> In 1980 IBM approached Digital Research, at [[Bill Gates]]' suggestion,<ref name=\"Isaacson_2014\"/> to license a forthcoming version of CP/M for its new product, the [[IBM Personal Computer]]. Upon the failure to obtain a signed [[non-disclosure agreement]], the talks failed, and IBM instead contracted with Microsoft to provide an operating system.<ref name=\"Bellis_2010\"/> The resulting product, [[MS-DOS]], soon began outselling CP/M.\n\nMany of the basic concepts and mechanisms of early versions of MS-DOS resembled those of CP/M. Internals like file-handling data structures were identical, and both referred to disk drives with a letter (<code>A:</code>, <code>B:</code>, etc.). MS-DOS's main innovation was its [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] [[file system]]. This similarity made it easier to port popular CP/M software like [[WordStar]] and [[dBase]]. However, CP/M's concept of separate user areas for files on the same disk was never ported to MS-DOS. Since MS-DOS had access to more memory (as few IBM PCs were sold with less than 64&nbsp;KB of memory, while CP/M could run in 16&nbsp;KB if necessary), more commands were built into the [[command.com|command-line shell]], making MS-DOS somewhat faster and easier to use on floppy-based computers.\n\nAlthough one of the first peripherals for the IBM PC was a SoftCard-like expansion card that let it run 8-bit CP/M software,<ref name=\"magid1982febmar\"/> CP/M rapidly lost market share as the microcomputing market moved to the IBM-compatible platform, and it never regained its former popularity. ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' magazine, at the time one of the leading industry magazines for microcomputers, essentially ceased covering CP/M products within a few years of the introduction of the IBM PC. For example, in 1983 there were still a few advertisements for S-100 boards and articles on CP/M software, but by 1987 these were no longer found in the magazine. A 1984 article in ''InfoWorld'' stated that efforts to introduce CP/M to the home market had been largely unsuccessful and most CP/M software was too expensive for home users,<ref name=\"Mace_1984\"/> and in 1986 stated that Kaypro had stopped production of their 8-bit CP/M-based models to concentrate on sales of MS-DOS compatible systems, long after most other vendors had ceased production of new equipment and software for CP/M.<ref name=\"Groth_1986\"/>\n\nLater versions of CP/M-86 made significant strides in performance and usability and were made compatible with MS-DOS. To reflect this compatibility the name was changed, and CP/M-86 became [[DOS Plus]], which in turn became [[DR-DOS]].\n\n===ZCPR===\nZCPR<ref name=\"ZCPR\"/> (the Z80 Command Processor Replacement) was introduced on 2 February 1982 as a drop-in replacement for the standard Digital Research console command processor (CCP) and was initially written by a group of computer hobbyists who called themselves \"The CCP Group\". They were Frank Wancho, Keith Petersen (the archivist behind [[Simtel]] at the time), Ron Fowler, Charlie Strom, Bob Mathias, and Richard Conn. Richard was, in fact, the driving force in this group (all of whom maintained contact through email).\n\nZCPR1 was released on a disk put out by SIG/M (Special Interest Group/Microcomputers), a part of the Amateur Computer Club of [[New Jersey]].\n\nZCPR2 was released on 14 February 1983. It was released as a set of ten disks from SIG/M. ZCPR2 was upgraded to 2.3, and also was released in 8080 code, permitting the use of ZCPR2 on 8080 and 8085 systems.\n\nZCPR3<ref name=\"ZCPR3\"/> was released on 14 July 1984, as a set of nine disks from SIG/M. The code for ZCPR3 could also be compiled (with reduced features) for the 8080 and would run on systems that did not have the requisite [[Z80]] microprocessor.\n\nIn January 1987, Richard Conn stopped developing ZCPR, and Echelon asked Jay Sage (who already had a privately enhanced ZCPR 3.1) to continue work on it. Thus, ZCPR 3.3 was developed and released. ZCPR 3.3 no longer supported the 8080 series of microprocessors, and added the most features of any upgrade in the ZCPR line.\n\nFeatures of ZCPR as of version 3 included:\n* shells\n* aliases\n* I/O redirection\n* flow control\n* named directories\n* search paths\n* custom menus\n* passwords\n* on line help\n\nZCPR3.3 also included a full complement of utilities with considerably extended capabilities. While enthusiastically supported by the CP/M user base of the time, ZCPR alone was insufficient to slow the demise of CP/M.\n\n==={{anchor|SCP|MICRODOS|Eastern derivatives}}East-bloc CP/M derivates===\n[[File:Robotron1715SCREEN.gif|thumb|320px|CP/M derivate ''SCP'' running on an [[East Germany|East German]] [[VEB Robotron|robotron]] [[PC 1715]]]]\nA number of CP/M-80 derivatives<!-- I specifically use the term \"derivatives\" here as it is at this time not known which systems were just illegally patched binaries, which were based on adapted DRI source codes, and which, if any, were independent functional reimplementations --> existed in the former East-bloc under various names including SCP ({{ill|Single User Control Program|de}}), SCP/M, CP/A,<ref name=\"Pohlers_2019_CPA\"/> CP/KC, CP/L, CP/KSOB, CP/Z, MICRODOS, BCU880, ZOAZ, OS/M, TOS/M, ZSDOS, M/OS, COS-PSA, DOS-PSA, CSOC, CSOS, CZ-CPM and others<!-- DAC, HC -->.<ref name=\"Robotron_2019\"/><ref name=\"SCP_2019\"/> There were also CP/M-86 derivatives named [[SCP1700]], [[CP/K]] and [[K8918-OS]].<ref name=\"SCP_2019\"/> They were produced by the East-German [[VEB Robotron]] and others.<ref name=\"SCP_2019\"/><ref name=\"Robotron_2019\"/><ref name=\"Pohlers_2019_CPA\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nA number of behaviors exhibited by [[Microsoft Windows]] are a result of [[backward compatibility]] with MS-DOS, which in turn attempted some backward compatibility with CP/M.

Little attention was paid to CP/M for about a year. In my spare time, I worked to improve overall facilities [\u2026] By this time, CP/M had been adapted for four different controllers. [\u2026] [ In 1976, [[Glenn Ewing]] approached me with a problem: [[IMSAI|Imsai]], Incorporated, for whom Glenn consulted, had shipped a large number of disk subsystems with a promise that an operating system would follow. I was somewhat reluctant to adapt CP/M to yet another controller, and thus the notion of a separated Basic I/O System (BIOS) evolved. In principle, the hardware dependent portions of CP/M were concentrated in the BIOS, thus allowing Glenn, or anyone else, to adapt CP/M to the Imsai equipment. Imsai was subsequently licensed to distribute [[CP/M 1.3|CP/M version 1.3]] which eventually evolved into an operating system called [[IMDOS]].

She made many contributions to CP/M 2.2 (the largest money spinner for DRI) including a background spooler for printing (simple multi-tasking) and system guides. In fact, in one book, Kathryn is called \"the mother of CP/M 2.2,\" for the hundreds and hundreds of hours she put in with Dave Brown, John Pierce, Bob Silberstein, and others, perfecting Kildall's original design. Kathryn was also the project manager for CP/M-86 and Concurrent CP/M-86. [\u2026] \"They Made America,\" [\u2026] paperback version.

My son was hired two months ago by WWE creative, and will begin working with the company in January. He would have started earlier, but he and I both felt it was important for him to fulfill the commitment he made to the college that employed him as the director of a residence hall. He could have merely explained that this was his dream job, and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but he chose to stay because it was the right thing \u2013 and because I told him that deep down, Mr. McMahon would respect him as a man of his word. My son was not given this job because of his last name. He earned it. He earned it by working for hundreds of hours in solitude, with no compensation, to prove his writing skills and mind for the business. There are no piece-of-cake jobs in WWE. As ESPN's Jonathan Coachman said of his time with WWE, \"you are expected to bring it every day.\" My son will do his best to \"bring it\" every day.

My son was hired two months ago by WWE creative, and will begin working with the company in January. He would have started earlier, but he and I both felt it was important for him to fulfill the commitment he made to the college that employed him as the director of a residence hall. He could have merely explained that this was his dream job, and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but he chose to stay because it was the right thing \u2013 and because I told him that deep down, Mr. McMahon would respect him as a man of his word. My son was not given this job because of his last name. He earned it. He earned it by working for hundreds of hours in solitude, with no compensation, to prove his writing skills and mind for the business. There are no piece-of-cake jobs in WWE. As ESPN's Jonathan Coachman said of his time with WWE, \"you are expected to bring it every day.\" My son will do his best to \"bring it\" every day.

As a result, on 26 August, the battalion was officially disbanded and the companies were dispatched to different British battalions and divisions in the [[21st Army Group]].

It was part of the [[197th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade|197th Infantry Brigade]], the 2nd-Line duplicate of the 1st-Line [[125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade|125th Infantry Brigade]].<ref name = Joslen361>Joslen, p. 361.</ref> It served with the [[66th Division (United Kingdom)|66th Infantry Division]] until 23 June 1940, when the division disbanded. The brigade was then transferred to the [[59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division]]. They [[Invasion of Normandy|landed in Normandy]] as part of [[Operation Overlord]] on 29 June 1944 and first saw action in early July at Malon on the North West outskirts of [[Battle for Caen|Caen]] as part of [[Operation Charnwood]], where they suffered 121 casualties. They also took part in [[Second Battle of the Odon|Operation Pomegranate]] and the battles on the Orne River. Of all the companies in this battalion, B Company stood out for the highest number of officers killed (in just two months, B Company lost three commanding officers, and '''all''' officers on a company attack just outside Vendes). On 21 August 1944, the divisional commander, [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Lewis Lyne]], late of the regiment, visited the battalion and informed them that the 59th Division was to be disbanded, due to a severe shortage of infantryman at the time, in order to provide replacements for other infantry units, and most had been battered during the recent heavy fighting. As a result, on 26 August, the battalion was officially disbanded and the companies were dispatched to different British battalions and divisions in the [[21st Army Group]]. A Company was sent to 7th [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] ([[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division|53rd (Welsh) Division]]), B Company to 2nd [[Gordon Highlanders]] ([[15th (Scottish) Infantry Division|15th (Scottish) Division]]), C Company to 2nd [[Glasgow Highlanders]] (15th (Scottish) Division) and D Company to 1st [[East Lancashire Regiment]] (53rd (Welsh) Division).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs-fusiliers.co.uk/gallerynew/2-5LFreformed1939/2-5LFNormandy.htm|title=2nd / 5th Battalion The XX The Lancashire Fusiliers in Normandy|publisher=|accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref> The 59th Division was considered by [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]] to be one of the best and most reliable divisions in his [[21st Army Group]]; it was only chosen for disbandment because it was the youngest British division in France. The Battalion War Diary claimed it to be \"''A sad day. 5 years of training for 8 weeks fighting, and unfortunately the break up of the battalion leaves the Regiment without representative in this Theatre of War''\".<ref>2/5th Battalion War Diary</ref>\n\nThe 2/6th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers came into being as a 2nd Line duplicate of the 1/6th Battalion.

However, in October 1942, the battalion was transferred elsewhere when it was replaced in the 197th Brigade by the 1/7th Battalion, [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]]. The 2/6th Battalion remained in the United Kingdom throughout the war, serving with many different brigades, including the [[211th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|211th infantry Brigade]] (part of the [[80th Infantry (Reserve) Division (United Kingdom)|80th Infantry (Reserve) Division]]) from October 1942 to October 1943.<ref name = Joslen361/> From July 1944, the battalion served with the [[203rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|203rd Infantry Brigade]], part of the [[77th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|77th Holding Division]], and acted in a training role for the rest of the war.<ref>Joslen, p. 366</ref>\n\nThis 2/8th Battalion was formed as a duplicate of the 1/8th Battalion and began the war in the [[199th (Manchester) Brigade|199th Infantry Brigade]], alongside the 6th and 7th [[Manchester Regiment]], part of the [[66th Division (United Kingdom)|66th Infantry Division]] and later was transferred to the [[55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division]] when the 66th Division was disbanded in July 1940.
