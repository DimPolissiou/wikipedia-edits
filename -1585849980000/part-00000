{"title_page": "Alternatives to general relativity", "text_new": "{{Short description|Proposed theories of gravity}}\n\n{{disputed|date=February 2016}}\n\n'''Alternatives to general relativity''' are [[Physical theory|physical theories]] that attempt to describe the phenomenon of [[gravitation]] in competition to Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]]. There have been many different attempts at constructing an ideal theory of [[gravity]].<ref name=\"Clifton\">{{cite journal | first =Timothy|last=Clifton|author2=Pedro G. Ferreira|author3=Antonio Padilla|author4=Constantinos Skordis|title=Modified Gravity and Cosmology|journal=Physics Reports|volume=513 num.3|issue=1|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2012.01.001|pages=1\u2013189|arxiv=1106.2476|bibcode=2012PhR...513....1C}}</ref>\n\nThese attempts can be split into four broad categories based on their scope. In this article, we discuss straightforward alternatives to general relativity, which do not involve quantum mechanics or force unification. Other theories which do attempt to construct a theory using the principles of quantum mechanics are known as theories of [[Quantum gravity|quantized gravity]]. Thirdly, there are theories which attempt to explain gravity and other forces at the same time; these are known as [[classical unified field theories]]. Finally, the most ambitious theories attempt to both put gravity in quantum mechanical terms and unify forces; these are called [[theory of everything|theories of everything]].\n\nNone of these alternatives to general relativity have gained wide acceptance. Despite many [[tests of general relativity]], general relativity has remained consistent with all observations so far. In contrast, many of the early alternatives have been definitively disproven. However, some of the alternative theories of gravity are supported by a minority of physicists, and the topic remains the subject of intense study in [[theoretical physics]].\n\n==History of gravitational theory through general relativity==\n{{Main|History of gravitational theory|History of general relativity}}\n\nEarly theories of gravity attempted to explain planetary orbits ([[Newtonian gravity|Newton]]) and more complicated orbits (e.g. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]). Then came unsuccessful attempts to [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|combine gravity and either wave or corpuscular theories]] of gravity. The whole landscape of physics was changed with the discovery of [[Lorentz transformations]], and this led to attempts to reconcile it with gravity. At the same time, experimental physicists started testing the foundations of gravity and relativity \u2013 [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]], the [[Tests of general relativity|gravitational deflection of light]], the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]. These considerations led to and past the development of [[general relativity]].\n\n===Newtonian gravity===\n{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation|Gauss's law for gravity}}\nIn Newton's theory<ref>{{cite book|last=Newton|first=I.|author-link=Isaac Newton|year=1686|title=[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]|language=la}}</ref> (rewritten using more modern mathematics) the density of mass <math>\\rho\\,</math> generates a scalar field, the gravitational potential <math>\\varphi\\,</math> in joules per kilogram, by\n:<math>{\\partial^2 \\varphi \\over \\partial x^j \\, \\partial x^j} = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nUsing the [[Nabla operator]] <math>\\nabla</math> for the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]] (partial derivatives), this can be conveniently written as:\n:<math>\\nabla^2 \\varphi = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nThis scalar field governs the motion of a [[free-fall]]ing particle by:\n:<math>{ d^2x^j\\over dt^2} = -{\\partial\\varphi\\over\\partial x^j\\,}.</math>\n\nAt distance ''r'' from an isolated mass ''M'', the scalar field is\n:<math>\\varphi = -\\frac{GM} r \\,.</math>\n\nThe [[Newtonian gravity|theory of Newton]], and Lagrange's improvement on the calculation (applying the variational principle), completely fails to take into account relativistic effects of course, and so can be rejected as a viable theory of gravity. Even so, Newton's theory is thought to be exactly correct in the limit of weak gravitational fields and low speeds and all other theories of gravity need to reproduce Newton's theory in the appropriate limits.\n\n===Mechanical explanations (1650\u20131900)===\nTo explain Newton's theory, some [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]] (including [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's theory]]) were created between 1650 and 1900, but they were overthrown because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which is not observed. Other models are violating the [[energy conservation law]] and are incompatible with modern [[thermodynamics]].\n\n===Electrostatic models (1870\u20131900)===\nAt the end of the 19th century, many tried to combine Newton's force law with the established laws of electrodynamics, like those of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Those models were used to explain the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|perihelion advance of Mercury]]. In 1890, L\u00e9vy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the speed of light in his theory. And in another attempt, [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the Perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypothesis were rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zenneck, J. |authorlink=Jonathan Zenneck |title=Gravitation |journal=Encyklop\u00e4die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss Ihrer Anwendungen |date=1903 |volume=5 |pages=25\u201367 |language=German |doi=10.1007/978-3-663-16016-8_2 |isbn=978-3-663-15445-7 }}</ref> In 1900, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] tried to explain gravity on the basis of his [[Lorentz ether theory]] and the [[Maxwell equations]]. He assumed, like [[Ottaviano Fabrizio Mossotti]] and [[Johann Karl Friedrich Z\u00f6llner]], that the attraction of opposite charged particles is stronger than the repulsion of equal charged particles. The resulting net force is exactly what is known as universal gravitation, in which the speed of gravity is that of light. But Lorentz calculated that the value for the perihelion advance of Mercury was much too low.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Lorentz, H.A. | authorlink = Hendrik Lorentz | title=Considerations on Gravitation | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) | date=1900 | volume=2 | pages=559\u2013574 | url=https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00014433.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Lorentz-invariant models (1905\u20131910)===\nBased on the [[principle of relativity]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (1905, 1906), [[Hermann Minkowski]] (1908), and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1910) tried to modify Newton's theory and to establish a [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariant]] gravitational law, in which the speed of gravity is that of light.

By then he knew of the gravitational redshift and the deflection of light. He had realized that [[Lorentz transformations]] are not generally applicable, but retained them. The theory states that the speed of light is constant in free space but varies in the presence of matter. The theory was only expected to hold when the source of the gravitational field is stationary.

(1917) \u00dcber die Spezielle und die Allgemeinen Relativat\u00e4tstheorie, Gemeinverst\u00e4ndlich, Vieweg, Braunschweig</ref> is what we now call \"general relativity\" (included here for comparison).

See [[relativity priority dispute]]. Hilbert was the first to correctly state the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] for general relativity, which is:\n\n:<math>S = {c^4 \\over 16 \\pi G} \\int R \\sqrt{-g} \\ d^4 x + S_m \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>G \\,</math> is Newton's gravitational constant, <math>R = R_{\\mu}^{~\\mu} \\,</math> is the [[Ricci curvature]] of space, <math>g = \\det ( g_{\\mu \\nu} ) \\,</math> and <math>S_m \\,</math> is the [[action (physics)|action]] due to mass.\n\nGeneral relativity is a tensor theory, the equations all contain tensors. Nordstr\u00f6m's theories, on the other hand, are scalar theories because the gravitational field is a scalar. Later in this article you will see scalar-tensor theories that contain a scalar field in addition to the tensors of general relativity, and other variants containing vector fields as well have been developed recently.\n\n== Motivations ==\nAfter general relativity, attempts were made either to improve on theories developed before general relativity, or to improve general relativity itself. Many different strategies were attempted, for example the addition of spin to general relativity, combining a general relativity-like metric with a spacetime that is static with respect to the expansion of the universe, getting extra freedom by adding another parameter. At least one theory was motivated by the desire to develop an alternative to general relativity that is free of singularities.\n\nExperimental tests improved along with the theories. Many of the different strategies that were developed soon after general relativity were abandoned, and there was a push to develop more general forms of the theories that survived, so that a theory would be ready when any test showed a disagreement with general relativity.\n\nBy the 1980s, the increasing accuracy of experimental tests had all confirmed general relativity; no competitors were left except for those that included general relativity as a special case. Further, shortly after that, theorists switched to string theory which was starting to look promising, but has since lost popularity. In the mid-1980s a few experiments were suggesting that gravity was being modified by the addition of a fifth force (or, in one case, of a fifth, sixth and seventh force) acting in the range of a few meters. Subsequent experiments eliminated these.\n\nMotivations for the more recent alternative theories are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"[[Cosmic inflation|inflation]]\", \"[[dark matter]]\" and \"[[dark energy]]\". Investigation of the [[Pioneer anomaly]] has caused renewed public interest in alternatives to general relativity.\n\n== Notation in this article ==\n{{Main|Mathematics of general relativity|Ricci calculus}}\n\n<math>c\\;</math> is the [[speed of light]], <math>G\\;</math> is the [[gravitational constant]]. \"[[Natural units|Geometric variables]]\" are not used.\n\nLatin indices go from 1 to 3, Greek indices go from 0 to 3. The [[Einstein notation|Einstein summation convention]] is used.\n\n<math>\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski metric]]. <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is a tensor, usually the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]. These have [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212,+,+,+).\n\n[[Partial derivative|Partial differentiation]] is written <math>\\partial_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{,\\mu}\\;</math>. [[Covariant differentiation]] is written <math>\\nabla_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{;\\mu}\\;</math>.\n\n== Classification of theories ==\nTheories of gravity can be classified, loosely, into several categories. Most of the theories described here have:\n* an '[[Action (physics)|action]]' (see the [[principle of least action]], a [[variational principle]] based on the concept of action)\n* a [[Lagrangian density]]\n* a [[metric tensor|metric]]\n\nIf a theory has a Lagrangian density for gravity, say <math>L\\,</math>, then the gravitational part of the action <math>S\\,</math> is the integral of that:\n:<math>S = \\int L \\sqrt{-g} \\, \\mathrm{d}^4x </math>\n\nIn this equation it is usual, though not essential, to have <math>g = -1\\,</math> at spatial infinity when using Cartesian coordinates. For example, the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] uses\n:<math>L\\,\\propto\\, R </math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the [[scalar curvature]], a measure of the curvature of space.\n\nAlmost every theory described in this article has an [[Action (physics)|action]]. It is the only known way to guarantee that the necessary conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum are incorporated automatically; although it is easy to construct an action where those conservation laws are violated. The original 1983 version of [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]] did not have an action.\n\nA few theories have an action but not a Lagrangian density. A good example is Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922>Whitehead, A.N. (1922) ''The Principles of Relativity'', Cambridge Univ. Press</ref>, the action there is termed non-local.\n\nA theory of gravity is a \"metric theory\" if and only if it can be given a mathematical representation in which two conditions hold:<br />\n''Condition 1'': There exists a symmetric [[metric tensor]] <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math> of [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212, +, +, +), which governs proper-length and proper-time measurements in the usual manner of special and general relativity:\n\n:<math>{d\\tau}^2 = - g_{\\mu \\nu} \\, dx^\\mu \\, dx^\\nu \\,</math>\n\nwhere there is a summation over indices <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\nu</math>.<br />\n''Condition 2'': Stressed matter and fields being acted upon by gravity respond in accordance with the equation:\n\n:<math>0 = \\nabla_\\nu T^{\\mu \\nu} = {T^{\\mu \\nu}}_{,\\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\sigma \\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\mu \\sigma} \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T^{\\mu \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] for all matter and non-gravitational fields, and where <math>\\nabla_{\\nu}</math> is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the metric and <math>\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\sigma \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[Christoffel symbol]]. The stress\u2013energy tensor should also satisfy an [[energy condition]].\n\nMetric theories include (from simplest to most complex):\n* [[#Scalar field theories|Scalar field theories]] (includes Conformally flat theories & Stratified theories with conformally flat space slices)\n** Bergman\n** Coleman\n** Einstein (1912)\n** Einstein\u2013Fokker theory\n** [[David L.

Given that variable c and zero deflection of light are both in conflict with experiment, the prospect for a successful scalar theory of gravity looks very unlikely.

The status of Cartan's theory is uncertain. Will<ref name=Will1981 /> claims that all non-metric theories are eliminated by Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Will (2001) tempers that by explaining experimental criteria for testing non-metric theories against Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> claims that Cartan's theory is the only non-metric theory to survive all experimental tests up to that date and Turyshev<ref name=Turyshev2006>Turyshev, S. G. (2006) Testing gravity in the solar system, http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~hz4/workshop/workshopppt/turyshev.pdf</ref> lists Cartan's theory among the few that have survived all experimental tests up to that date. The following is a quick sketch of Cartan's theory as restated by Trautman.<ref name=Trautman1972>Trautman, A. (1972) On the Einstein\u2013Cartan equations I, Bulletin de l'Academie Polonaise des Sciences 20, 185-190</ref>\n\nCartan<ref name=Cartan1922 /><ref name=Cartan1923 /> suggested a simple generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. He proposed a model of space time with a metric tensor and a linear \"connection\" compatible with the metric but not necessarily symmetric. The torsion tensor of the connection is related to the density of intrinsic angular momentum. Independently of Cartan, similar ideas were put forward by Sciama, by Kibble in the years 1958 to 1966, culminating in a 1976 review by Hehl et al.\n\nThe original description is in terms of differential forms, but for the present article that is replaced by the more familiar language of tensors (risking loss of accuracy). As in general relativity, the Lagrangian is made up of a massless and a mass part. The Lagrangian for the massless part is:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nL & ={1\\over 32\\pi G}\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu g^{\\nu\\xi}x^\\eta x^\\zeta \\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta} \\\\[5pt]\n\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu & =d \\omega^\\mu_\\nu + \\omega^\\eta_\\xi \\\\[5pt]\n\\nabla x^\\mu & =-\\omega^\\mu_\\nu x^\\nu\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe <math>\\omega^\\mu_\\nu\\;</math> is the linear connection. <math>\\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta}\\;</math> is the completely antisymmetric pseudo-tensor ([[Levi-Civita symbol]]) with <math>\\varepsilon_{0123}=\\sqrt{-g}\\;</math>, and <math>g^{\\nu\\xi}\\,</math> is the metric tensor as usual. By assuming that the linear connection is metric, it is possible to remove the unwanted freedom inherent in the non-metric theory. The stress\u2013energy tensor is calculated from:\n\n:<math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 16\\pi G} (g^{\\mu\\nu}\\eta^\\xi_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\mu}\\eta^\\nu_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\nu} \\eta^\\mu_\\eta) \\Omega^\\eta_\\xi\\;</math>\n\nThe space curvature is not Riemannian, but on a Riemannian space-time the Lagrangian would reduce to the Lagrangian of general relativity.\n\nSome equations of the non-metric theory of Belinfante and Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> have already been discussed in the section on [[#Bimetric theories|bimetric theories]].\n\nA distinctively non-metric theory is given by [[gauge theory gravity]], which replaces the metric in its field equations with a pair of gauge fields in flat spacetime.  On the one hand, the theory is quite conservative because it is substantially equivalent to Einstein\u2013Cartan theory (or general relativity in the limit of vanishing spin), differing mostly in the nature of its global solutions.  On the other hand, it is radical because it replaces differential geometry with [[geometric algebra]].\n\n== Modern theories 1980s to present ==\nThis section includes alternatives to general relativity published after the observations of galaxy rotation that led to the hypothesis of \"dark matter\". There is no known reliable list of comparison of these theories.

These theories are presented with a cosmological constant or added scalar or vector potential.\n\n=== Motivations ===\nMotivations for the more recent alternatives to general relativity are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"inflation\", \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\". The basic idea is that gravity agrees with general relativity at the present epoch but may have been quite different in the early universe.\n\nThere was a slow dawning realisation in the physics world that there were several problems inherent in the then big bang scenario, two of these were the [[horizon problem]] and the observation that at early times when quarks were first forming there was not enough space on the universe to contain even one quark. Inflation theory was developed to overcome these. Another alternative was constructing an alternative to general relativity in which the speed of light was larger in the early universe. The discovery of unexpected rotation curves for galaxies took everyone by surprise. Could there be more mass in the universe than we are aware of, or is the theory of gravity itself wrong? The consensus now is that the missing mass is \"cold dark matter\", but that consensus was only reached after trying alternatives to general relativity and some physicists still believe that alternative models of gravity might hold the answer.\n\nIn the 1990s, supernova surveys discovered the accelerated expansion of the universe, usually attributed to [[dark energy]]. This led to the rapid reinstatement of Einstein's cosmological constant, and quintessence arrived as an alternative to the cosmological constant. At least one new alternative to general relativity attempted to explain the supernova surveys' results in a completely different way. The measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] ruled out many alternative theories of gravity as explanation for the accelerated expansion.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |journal=Phys.

It was quickly discovered that alternatives to general relativity could explain this anomaly. This is now believed to be accounted for by non-uniform thermal radiation.\n\n=== Cosmological constant and quintessence ===\n{{see also|Cosmological constant|Einstein\u2013Hilbert action|Quintessence (physics)}}\n\nThe cosmological constant <math>\\Lambda\\;</math> is a very old idea, going back to Einstein in 1917.<ref name=Einstein1917 /> The success of the Friedmann model of the universe in which <math>\\Lambda=0\\;</math> led to the general acceptance that it is zero, but the use of a non-zero value came back with a vengeance when data from supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating\n\nFirst, let's see how it influences the equations of Newtonian gravity and General Relativity. In Newtonian gravity, the addition of the cosmological constant changes the Newton\u2013Poisson equation from:\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi=4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi + \\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda c^2 = 4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nIn general relativity, it changes the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action from\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int R\\sqrt{-g} \\, d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int (R-2\\Lambda)\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nwhich changes the field equation\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G} \\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R \\right)\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G}\\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R + g^{\\mu\\nu} \\Lambda \\right)\\;</math>\n\nIn alternative theories of gravity, a cosmological constant can be added to the action in exactly the same way.\n\nThe cosmological constant is not the only way to get an accelerated expansion of the universe in alternatives to general relativity. We've already seen how the scalar potential <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> can be added to scalar tensor theories. This can also be done in every alternative the general relativity that contains a scalar field <math>\\varphi\\;</math> by adding the term <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> inside the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action, the <math>L_\\varphi\\;</math> part of\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4x \\, \\sqrt{-g} \\, L_\\varphi+S_m\\;</math>\n\nBecause <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> is an arbitrary function of the scalar field, it can be set to give an acceleration that is large in the early universe and small at the present epoch. This is known as quintessence.\n\nA similar method can be used in alternatives to general relativity that use vector fields, including Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> and vector-tensor theories. A term proportional to\n\n: <math>K^\\mu K^\\nu g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math>\n\nis added to the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action.\n\n=== Farnes' theories === \nIn December 2018, the astrophysicist [[Jamie Farnes]] from the [[University of Oxford]] proposed a [[dark fluid]] theory, related to notions of gravitationally repulsive negative masses that were presented earlier by [[Albert Einstein]]. The theory may help to better understand the considerable amounts of unknown [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] in the [[universe]].<ref name=\"ARX-2018\">{{cite journal |last=Farnes |first=J.S. |title=A Unifying Theory of Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Negative Masses and Matter Creation within a Modified \u039bCDM Framework |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=620 |pages=A92 |arxiv=1712.07962 |year=2018 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832898 |bibcode=2018A&A...620A..92F }}</ref>\n\nThe theory relies on the concept of [[negative mass]] and reintroduces [[Fred Hoyle]]'s creation tensor in order to allow [[matter creation]] for only negative mass particles. In this way, the negative mass particles surround galaxies and apply a pressure onto them, thereby resembling dark matter. As these hypothesised particles mutually repel one another, they push apart the Universe, thereby resembling dark energy. The creation of matter allows the density of the exotic negative mass particles to remain constant as a function of time, and so appears like a [[cosmological constant]]. Einstein's field equations are modified to:\n: <math>R_{\\mu \\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} \\left( T_{\\mu \\nu}^{+} + T_{\\mu \\nu}^{-} + C_{\\mu \\nu} \\right)</math>\n\nAccording to Occam's razor, Farnes' theory is a simpler alternative to the conventional LambdaCDM model, as both dark energy and dark matter (two hypotheses) are solved using a single negative mass fluid (one hypothesis). The theory will be directly testable using the world's largest radio telescope, the [[Square Kilometre Array]] which should come online in 2022.<ref name=\"EA-20181205\">{{cite web |author=University of Oxford |title=Bringing balance to the universe: New theory could explain missing 95 percent of the cosmos |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/uoo-bbt120318.php |date=5 December 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=6 December 2018 |author-link=University of Oxford }}</ref>\n\n=== Relativistic MOND ===\n{{main|Modified Newtonian dynamics|Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|Extended theories of gravity}}\n\nThe original theory of MOND by Milgrom was developed in 1983 as an alternative to \"dark matter\". Departures from Newton's law of gravitation are governed by an acceleration scale, not a distance scale. MOND successfully explains the Tully-Fisher observation that the luminosity of a galaxy should scale as the fourth power of the rotation speed. It also explains why the rotation discrepancy in dwarf galaxies is particularly large.\n\nThere were several problems with MOND in the beginning.\n# It did not include relativistic effects\n# It violated the conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum\n# It was inconsistent in that it gives different galactic orbits for gas and for stars\n# It did not state how to calculate gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters.\n\nBy 1984, problems 2 and 3 had been solved by introducing a Lagrangian ([[AQUAL]]). A relativistic version of this based on scalar-tensor theory was rejected because it allowed waves in the scalar field to propagate faster than light. The Lagrangian of the non-relativistic form is:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}f\\left\\lbrack \\frac{|\\nabla\\varphi|^2}{a_0^2}\\right\\rbrack-\\rho\\varphi</math>\n\nThe relativistic version of this has:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}\\tilde f \\left( \\ell_0^2 g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\partial_\\mu\\varphi\\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi \\right )</math>\n\nwith a nonstandard mass action. Here <math>f</math> and <math>\\tilde f</math> are arbitrary functions selected to give Newtonian and MOND behaviour in the correct limits, and <math>l_0 = c^2/a_0\\;</math> is the MOND length scale. By 1988, a second scalar field (PCC) fixed problems with the earlier scalar-tensor version but is in conflict with the perihelion precession of Mercury and gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters. By 1997, MOND had been successfully incorporated in a stratified relativistic theory [Sanders], but as this is a preferred frame theory it has problems of its own. Bekenstein<ref name=Bekenstein2004 /> introduced a [[Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|tensor-vector-scalar]] model (TeVeS). This has two scalar fields <math>\\varphi</math>  and <math>\\sigma\\;</math> and vector field <math>U_\\alpha</math>.

The skew field coupling is a Pauli coupling and is gauge invariant for any source current. The source current looks like a matter fermion field associated with baryon and lepton number.\n\n====Scalar-tensor-vector gravity====\n{{main|Scalar\u2013tensor\u2013vector gravity}}\n\nMoffat's [[Scalar\u2013tensor\u2013vector gravity]]<ref name=Moffat2006 /> contains a tensor, vector and three scalar fields. But the equations are quite straightforward.

For in-depth coverage of these tests, see Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> Ch.39, Will <ref name=Will1981 /> Table 2.1, and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 />.  Most such tests can be categorized as in the following subsections.\n\n=== Self-consistency ===\nSelf-consistency among non-metric theories includes eliminating theories allowing [[tachyon]]s, ghost poles and higher order poles, and those that have problems with behaviour at infinity. Among metric theories, self-consistency is best illustrated by describing several theories that fail this test. The classic example is the spin-two field theory of Fierz and Pauli<ref name=Fierz1939 />); the field equations imply that gravitating bodies move in straight lines, whereas the equations of motion insist that gravity deflects bodies away from straight line motion. Yilmaz (1971)<ref name=Yilmaz1973 /> contains a tensor gravitational field used to construct a metric; it is mathematically inconsistent because the functional dependence of the metric on the tensor field is not well defined.\n\n=== Completeness ===\nTo be complete, a theory of gravity must be capable of analysing the outcome of every experiment of interest. It must therefore mesh with electromagnetism and all other physics. For instance, any theory that cannot predict from first principles the movement of planets or the behaviour of atomic clocks is incomplete.\n\nMany early theories are incomplete in that it is unclear whether the density <math>\\rho</math> used by the theory should be calculated from the stress\u2013energy tensor <math>T</math> as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu</math> or as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^{\\mu \\nu}</math>, where <math>u</math> is the [[four-velocity]], and <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. The theories of Thirry (1948) and Jordan<ref name=Jordan1955 /> are incomplete unless Jordan's parameter <math>\\eta\\;</math> is set to -1, in which case they match the theory of Brans\u2013Dicke<ref name=Brans1961 /> and so are worthy of further consideration. Milne<ref name=Milne1948 /> is incomplete because it makes no gravitational red-shift prediction. The theories of Whitrow and Morduch<ref name=Whitrow1960 /><ref name=Whitrow1965 />, Kustaanheimo<ref name=Kustaanheimo1966 /> and Kustaanheimo and Nuotio<ref name=Kustaanheimo1967 /> are either incomplete or inconsistent. The incorporation of Maxwell's equations is incomplete unless it is assumed that they are imposed on the flat background space-time, and when that is done they are inconsistent, because they predict zero gravitational redshift when the wave version of light (Maxwell theory) is used, and nonzero redshift when the particle version (photon) is used. Another more obvious example is Newtonian gravity with Maxwell's equations; light as photons is deflected by gravitational fields (by half that of general relativity) but light as waves is not.\n\n=== Classical tests ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\nThere are three \"classical\" tests (dating back to the 1910s or earlier) of the ability of gravity theories to handle relativistic effects; they are [[gravitational redshift]], [[gravitational lensing]] (generally tested around the Sun), and anomalous perihelion advance of the planets. Each theory should reproduce the observed results in these areas, which have to date always aligned with the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, [[Irwin I. Shapiro]] found a fourth test, called the [[Shapiro delay]]. It is usually regarded as a \"classical\" test as well.\n\n=== Agreement with Newtonian mechanics and special relativity ===\nAs an example of disagreement with Newtonian experiments, Birkhoff<ref name=Birkhoff1943>{{cite journal | last1 = Birkhoff | first1 = G. D. | year = 1943 | title = Matter, electricity and gravitation in flat space-time | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This was the consequence of an assumption made to simplify handling the collision of masses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== The Einstein equivalence principle ===\n{{Main|Equivalence principle}}\n\nEinstein's Equivalence Principle has three components. The first is the uniqueness of free fall, also known as the Weak Equivalence Principle. This is satisfied if inertial mass is equal to gravitational mass. ''\u03b7'' is a parameter used to test the maximum allowable violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. The first tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle were done by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s before 1900 and limited ''\u03b7'' to less than 5{{e|-9}}. Modern tests have reduced that to less than 5{{e|-13}}. The second is Lorentz invariance. In the absence of gravitational effects the speed of light is constant. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b4''. The first tests of Lorentz invariance were done by Michelson and Morley before 1890 and limited ''\u03b4'' to less than 5{{e|-3}}. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-21}}. The third is local position invariance, which includes spatial and temporal invariance. The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment is independent of where and when it is performed. Spatial local position invariance is tested using gravitational redshift measurements. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b1''. Upper limits on this found by Pound and Rebka in 1960 limited ''\u03b1'' to less than 0.1. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-4}}.\n\n[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture states that any complete, self-consistent theory of gravity that embodies the Weak Equivalence Principle necessarily embodies Einstein's Equivalence Principle. This is likely to be true if the theory has full energy conservation. Metric theories satisfy the Einstein Equivalence Principle. Extremely few non-metric theories satisfy this. For example, the non-metric theory of Belinfante & Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> is eliminated by the ''TH\u03b5\u03bc'' formalism for testing Einstein's Equivalence Principle.  Gauge theory gravity is a notable exception, where the strong equivalence principle is essentially the [[minimal coupling]] of the [[gauge covariant derivative]].\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian formalism ===\n{{Main|Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism}}\n\nSee also [[Tests of general relativity]], Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> and Will<ref name=Will1981 /> for more information.\n\nWork on developing a standardized rather than ad-hoc set of tests for evaluating alternative gravitation models began with Eddington in 1922 and resulted in a standard set of Parametric post-Newtonian numbers in Nordtvedt and Will<ref name=Nordtvedt1972>{{cite journal | last1 = Nordtvedt Jr | first1 = K. | last2 = Will | first2 = C. M. | year = 1972 | title = Conservation laws and preferred frames in relativistic gravity II | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 177 | issue = | page = 775 | bibcode = 1972ApJ...177..775N | doi = 10.1086/151755 }}</ref> and Will and Nordtvedt<ref name=Will1972 />. Each parameter measures a different aspect of how much a theory departs from Newtonian gravity. Because we are talking about deviation from Newtonian theory here, these only measure weak-field effects. The effects of strong gravitational fields are examined later.\n\nThese ten are: <math>\\gamma, \\beta,\\eta,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3,\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4.</math>\n\n*<math>\\gamma</math> is a measure of space curvature, being zero for Newtonian gravity and one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\beta</math> is a measure of nonlinearity in the addition of gravitational fields, one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\eta</math> is a check for preferred location effects.\n*<math>\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of \"preferred-frame effects\". Any theory of gravity in which at least one of the three is nonzero is called a preferred-frame theory.\n*<math>\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of breakdowns in global conservation laws. A theory of gravity possesses 4 conservation laws for energy-momentum and 6 for angular momentum only if all five are zero.\n\n=== Strong gravity and gravitational waves ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nParametric post-Newtonian is only a measure of weak field effects. Strong gravity effects can be seen in compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Experimental tests such as the stability of white dwarfs, spin-down rate of pulsars, orbits of binary pulsars and the existence of a black hole horizon can be used as tests of alternative to general relativity. General relativity predicts that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Many alternatives to general relativity say that gravitational waves travel faster than light, possibly breaking of causality. After the multi-messaging detection of the GW170817 coalescence of neutron stars, where light and gravitational waves were measured to travel at the same speed with an error of 1/10<sup>15</sup>, many of those modified theory of gravity were excluded.\n\n=== Cosmological tests ===\nMany of these have been developed recently. For those theories that aim to replace [[dark matter]], the [[galaxy rotation curve]], the [[Tully-Fisher relation]], the faster rotation rate of dwarf galaxies, and the [[gravitational lens]]ing due to galactic clusters act as constraints. For those theories that aim to replace [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], the size of ripples in the spectrum of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] is the strictest test. For those theories that incorporate or aim to replace [[dark energy]], the supernova brightness results and the age of the universe can be used as tests. Another test is the flatness of the universe. With general relativity, the combination of baryonic matter, dark matter and dark energy add up to make the universe exactly flat. As the accuracy of experimental tests improve, alternatives to general relativity that aim to replace dark matter or dark energy will have to explain why.\n\n== Results of testing theories ==\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian parameters for a range of theories ===\n(See Will<ref name=Will1981 /> and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 /> for more details. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> gives a table for translating parameters from the notation of Ni to that of Will)\n\nGeneral Relativity is now more than 100 years old, during which one alternative theory of gravity after another has failed to agree with ever more accurate observations. One illustrative example is [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism]]. The following table lists Parametric post-Newtonian values for a large number of theories. If the value in a cell matches that in the column heading then the full formula is too complicated to include here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!Width=\"45\"|<math>\\gamma</math>\n!

The value closest to zero is listed.\n\nAll experimental tests agree with general relativity so far, and so Parametric post-Newtonian analysis immediately eliminates all the scalar field theories in the table. A full list of Parametric post-Newtonian parameters is not available for Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922 />, Deser-Laurent<ref name=Deser1968 />, Bollini-Giambiagi-Tiomino<ref name=Bollini1970 />, but in these three cases <math>\\beta=\\xi</math>,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} which is in strong conflict with general relativity and experimental results. In particular, these theories predict incorrect amplitudes for the Earth's tides.  (A minor modification of [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]] avoids this problem.  However, the modification predicts the [[Nordtvedt effect]], which has been experimentally constrained.)\n\n=== Theories that fail other tests ===\nThe stratified theories of Ni<ref name=Ni1973 />, Lee Lightman and Ni<ref name=Lee1974 /> are non-starters because they all fail to explain the perihelion advance of Mercury. The bimetric theories of Lightman and Lee<ref name=Lightman1973 />, Rosen<ref name=Rosen1975 />, Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> all fail some of the tests associated with strong gravitational fields. The scalar-tensor theories include general relativity as a special case, but only agree with the Parametric post-Newtonian values of general relativity when they are equal to general relativity to within experimental error. As experimental tests get more accurate, the deviation of the scalar-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. The same is true of vector-tensor theories, the deviation of the vector-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. Further, vector-tensor theories are semi-conservative; they have a nonzero value for <math>\\alpha_2</math> which can have a measurable effect on the Earth's tides. Non-metric theories, such as Belinfante and Swihart,<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> usually fail to agree with experimental tests of Einstein's equivalence principle. And that leaves, as a likely valid alternative to general relativity, nothing except possibly Cartan.<ref name=Cartan1922 /> That was the situation until cosmological discoveries pushed the development of modern alternatives.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Carroll, Sean.

There have been many different attempts at constructing an ideal theory of [[gravity]].<ref name=\"Clifton\">{{cite journal | first =Timothy|last=Clifton|author2=Pedro G. Ferreira|author3=Antonio Padilla|author4=Constantinos Skordis|title=Modified Gravity and Cosmology|journal=Physics Reports|volume=513 num.3|issue=1|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2012.01.001|pages=1\u2013189|arxiv=1106.2476|bibcode=2012PhR...513....1C}}</ref>\n\nThese attempts can be split into four broad categories based on their scope. In this article, we discuss straightforward alternatives to general relativity, which do not involve quantum mechanics or force unification. Other theories which do attempt to construct a theory using the principles of quantum mechanics are known as theories of [[Quantum gravity|quantized gravity]]. Thirdly, there are theories which attempt to explain gravity and other forces at the same time; these are known as [[classical unified field theories]]. Finally, the most ambitious theories attempt to both put gravity in quantum mechanical terms and unify forces; these are called [[theory of everything|theories of everything]].\n\nNone of these alternatives to general relativity have gained wide acceptance. Despite many [[tests of general relativity]], general relativity has remained consistent with all observations so far. In contrast, many of the early alternatives have been definitively disproven. However, some of the alternative theories of gravity are supported by a minority of physicists, and the topic remains the subject of intense study in [[theoretical physics]].\n\n==History of gravitational theory through general relativity==\n{{Main|History of gravitational theory|History of general relativity}}\n\nEarly theories of gravity attempted to explain planetary orbits ([[Newtonian gravity|Newton]]) and more complicated orbits (e.g. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]). Then came unsuccessful attempts to [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|combine gravity and either wave or corpuscular theories]] of gravity. The whole landscape of physics was changed with the discovery of [[Lorentz transformations]], and this led to attempts to reconcile it with gravity. At the same time, experimental physicists started testing the foundations of gravity and relativity \u2013 [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]], the [[Tests of general relativity|gravitational deflection of light]], the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]. These considerations led to and past the development of [[general relativity]].\n\n===Newtonian gravity===\n{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation|Gauss's law for gravity}}\nIn Newton's theory<ref>Newton, I. (1686) ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''</ref> (rewritten using more modern mathematics) the density of mass <math>\\rho\\,</math> generates a scalar field, the gravitational potential <math>\\varphi\\,</math> in joules per kilogram, by\n:<math>{\\partial^2 \\varphi \\over \\partial x^j \\, \\partial x^j} = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nUsing the [[Nabla operator]] <math>\\nabla</math> for the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]] (partial derivatives), this can be conveniently written as:\n:<math>\\nabla^2 \\varphi = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nThis scalar field governs the motion of a [[free-fall]]ing particle by:\n:<math>{ d^2x^j\\over dt^2} = -{\\partial\\varphi\\over\\partial x^j\\,}.</math>\n\nAt distance ''r'' from an isolated mass ''M'', the scalar field is\n:<math>\\varphi = -\\frac{GM} r \\,.</math>\n\nThe [[Newtonian gravity|theory of Newton]], and Lagrange's improvement on the calculation (applying the variational principle), completely fails to take into account relativistic effects of course, and so can be rejected as a viable theory of gravity. Even so, Newton's theory is thought to be exactly correct in the limit of weak gravitational fields and low speeds and all other theories of gravity need to reproduce Newton's theory in the appropriate limits.\n\n===Mechanical explanations (1650\u20131900)===\nTo explain Newton's theory, some [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]] (including [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's theory]]) were created between 1650 and 1900, but they were overthrown because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which is not observed. Other models are violating the [[energy conservation law]] and are incompatible with modern [[thermodynamics]].\n\n===Electrostatic models (1870\u20131900)===\nAt the end of the 19th century, many tried to combine Newton's force law with the established laws of electrodynamics, like those of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Those models were used to explain the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|perihelion advance of Mercury]]. In 1890, L\u00e9vy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the speed of light in his theory. And in another attempt, [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the Perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypothesis were rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zenneck, J. |authorlink=Jonathan Zenneck |title=Gravitation |journal=Encyklop\u00e4die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss Ihrer Anwendungen |date=1903 |volume=5 |pages=25\u201367 |language=German |doi=10.1007/978-3-663-16016-8_2 |isbn=978-3-663-15445-7 }}</ref> In 1900, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] tried to explain gravity on the basis of his [[Lorentz ether theory]] and the [[Maxwell equations]]. He assumed, like [[Ottaviano Fabrizio Mossotti]] and [[Johann Karl Friedrich Z\u00f6llner]], that the attraction of opposite charged particles is stronger than the repulsion of equal charged particles. The resulting net force is exactly what is known as universal gravitation, in which the speed of gravity is that of light. But Lorentz calculated that the value for the perihelion advance of Mercury was much too low.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Lorentz, H.A. | authorlink = Hendrik Lorentz | title=Considerations on Gravitation | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) | date=1900 | volume=2 | pages=559\u2013574 | url=https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00014433.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Lorentz-invariant models (1905\u20131910)===\nBased on the [[principle of relativity]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (1905, 1906), [[Hermann Minkowski]] (1908), and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1910) tried to modify Newton's theory and to establish a [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariant]] gravitational law, in which the speed of gravity is that of light.

By then he knew of the gravitational redshift and the deflection of light. He had realized that [[Lorentz transformations]] are not generally applicable, but retained them.

Nordstr\u00f6m's theories, on the other hand, are scalar theories because the gravitational field is a scalar. Later in this article you will see scalar-tensor theories that contain a scalar field in addition to the tensors of general relativity, and other variants containing vector fields as well have been developed recently.\n\n== Motivations ==\nAfter general relativity, attempts were made either to improve on theories developed before general relativity, or to improve general relativity itself. Many different strategies were attempted, for example the addition of spin to general relativity, combining a general relativity-like metric with a spacetime that is static with respect to the expansion of the universe, getting extra freedom by adding another parameter. At least one theory was motivated by the desire to develop an alternative to general relativity that is free of singularities.\n\nExperimental tests improved along with the theories. Many of the different strategies that were developed soon after general relativity were abandoned, and there was a push to develop more general forms of the theories that survived, so that a theory would be ready when any test showed a disagreement with general relativity.\n\nBy the 1980s, the increasing accuracy of experimental tests had all confirmed general relativity; no competitors were left except for those that included general relativity as a special case. Further, shortly after that, theorists switched to string theory which was starting to look promising, but has since lost popularity. In the mid-1980s a few experiments were suggesting that gravity was being modified by the addition of a fifth force (or, in one case, of a fifth, sixth and seventh force) acting in the range of a few meters. Subsequent experiments eliminated these.\n\nMotivations for the more recent alternative theories are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"[[Cosmic inflation|inflation]]\", \"[[dark matter]]\" and \"[[dark energy]]\". Investigation of the [[Pioneer anomaly]] has caused renewed public interest in alternatives to general relativity.\n\n== Notation in this article ==\n{{Main|Mathematics of general relativity|Ricci calculus}}\n\n<math>c\\;</math> is the [[speed of light]], <math>G\\;</math> is the [[gravitational constant]]. \"[[Natural units|Geometric variables]]\" are not used.\n\nLatin indices go from 1 to 3, Greek indices go from 0 to 3.

[[Covariant differentiation]] is written <math>\\nabla_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{;\\mu}\\;</math>.\n\n== Classification of theories ==\nTheories of gravity can be classified, loosely, into several categories. Most of the theories described here have:\n* an '[[Action (physics)|action]]' (see the [[principle of least action]], a [[variational principle]] based on the concept of action)\n* a [[Lagrangian density]]\n* a [[metric tensor|metric]]\n\nIf a theory has a Lagrangian density for gravity, say <math>L\\,</math>, then the gravitational part of the action <math>S\\,</math> is the integral of that:\n:<math>S = \\int L \\sqrt{-g} \\, \\mathrm{d}^4x </math>\n\nIn this equation it is usual, though not essential, to have <math>g = -1\\,</math> at spatial infinity when using Cartesian coordinates. For example, the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] uses\n:<math>L\\,\\propto\\, R </math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the [[scalar curvature]], a measure of the curvature of space.\n\nAlmost every theory described in this article has an [[Action (physics)|action]]. It is the only known way to guarantee that the necessary conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum are incorporated automatically; although it is easy to construct an action where those conservation laws are violated. The original 1983 version of [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]] did not have an action.\n\nA few theories have an action but not a Lagrangian density. A good example is Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922>Whitehead, A.N. (1922) ''The Principles of Relativity'', Cambridge Univ. Press</ref>, the action there is termed non-local.\n\nA theory of gravity is a \"metric theory\" if and only if it can be given a mathematical representation in which two conditions hold:<br />\n''Condition 1'': There exists a symmetric [[metric tensor]] <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math> of [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212, +, +, +), which governs proper-length and proper-time measurements in the usual manner of special and general relativity:\n\n:<math>{d\\tau}^2 = - g_{\\mu \\nu} \\, dx^\\mu \\, dx^\\nu \\,</math>\n\nwhere there is a summation over indices <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\nu</math>.<br />\n''Condition 2'': Stressed matter and fields being acted upon by gravity respond in accordance with the equation:\n\n:<math>0 = \\nabla_\\nu T^{\\mu \\nu} = {T^{\\mu \\nu}}_{,\\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\sigma \\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\mu \\sigma} \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T^{\\mu \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] for all matter and non-gravitational fields, and where <math>\\nabla_{\\nu}</math> is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the metric and <math>\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\sigma \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[Christoffel symbol]].

How to add a [[#Cosmological constant and quintessence|cosmological constant or quintessence]] to a theory is discussed under Modern Theories (see also [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]]).\n\n=== Scalar field theories ===\n{{See also|Scalar theories of gravitation}}\n\nThe scalar field theories of Nordstr\u00f6m<ref name=Nordstr\u00f6m1912 /><ref name=Nordstr\u00f6m1913 /> have already been discussed.

Given that variable c and zero deflection of light are both in conflict with experiment, the prospect for a successful scalar theory of gravity looks very unlikely. Further, if the parameters of a scalar theory are adjusted so that the deflection of light is correct then the gravitational redshift is likely to be wrong.\n\nNi<ref name=Ni1972 /> summarised some theories and also created two more. In the first, a pre-existing special relativity space-time and universal time coordinate acts with matter and non-gravitational fields to generate a scalar field.  This scalar field acts together with all the rest to generate the metric.\n\nThe action is:\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4 x \\sqrt{-g}L_\\varphi+S_m</math>\n\n: <math>L_\\varphi=\\varphi R-2g^{\\mu\\nu} \\, \\partial_\\mu\\varphi \\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi</math>\n\nMisner et al.<ref name=Misner1973>Misner, C.

This theory is self-consistent and complete.

The status of Cartan's theory is uncertain. Will<ref name=Will1981 /> claims that all non-metric theories are eliminated by Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Will (2001) tempers that by explaining experimental criteria for testing non-metric theories against Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> claims that Cartan's theory is the only non-metric theory to survive all experimental tests up to that date and Turyshev<ref name=Turyshev2006>Turyshev, S. G. (2006) Testing gravity in the solar system, http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~hz4/workshop/workshopppt/turyshev.pdf</ref> lists Cartan's theory among the few that have survived all experimental tests up to that date. The following is a quick sketch of Cartan's theory as restated by Trautman.<ref name=Trautman1972>Trautman, A. (1972) On the Einstein\u2013Cartan equations I, Bulletin de l'Academie Polonaise des Sciences 20, 185-190</ref>\n\nCartan<ref name=Cartan1922 /><ref name=Cartan1923 /> suggested a simple generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. He proposed a model of space time with a metric tensor and a linear \"connection\" compatible with the metric but not necessarily symmetric. The torsion tensor of the connection is related to the density of intrinsic angular momentum. Independently of Cartan, similar ideas were put forward by Sciama, by Kibble in the years 1958 to 1966, culminating in a 1976 review by Hehl et al.\n\nThe original description is in terms of differential forms, but for the present article that is replaced by the more familiar language of tensors (risking loss of accuracy). As in general relativity, the Lagrangian is made up of a massless and a mass part. The Lagrangian for the massless part is:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nL & ={1\\over 32\\pi G}\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu g^{\\nu\\xi}x^\\eta x^\\zeta \\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta} \\\\[5pt]\n\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu & =d \\omega^\\mu_\\nu + \\omega^\\eta_\\xi \\\\[5pt]\n\\nabla x^\\mu & =-\\omega^\\mu_\\nu x^\\nu\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe <math>\\omega^\\mu_\\nu\\;</math> is the linear connection. <math>\\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta}\\;</math> is the completely antisymmetric pseudo-tensor ([[Levi-Civita symbol]]) with <math>\\varepsilon_{0123}=\\sqrt{-g}\\;</math>, and <math>g^{\\nu\\xi}\\,</math> is the metric tensor as usual. By assuming that the linear connection is metric, it is possible to remove the unwanted freedom inherent in the non-metric theory. The stress\u2013energy tensor is calculated from:\n\n:<math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 16\\pi G} (g^{\\mu\\nu}\\eta^\\xi_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\mu}\\eta^\\nu_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\nu} \\eta^\\mu_\\eta) \\Omega^\\eta_\\xi\\;</math>\n\nThe space curvature is not Riemannian, but on a Riemannian space-time the Lagrangian would reduce to the Lagrangian of general relativity.\n\nSome equations of the non-metric theory of Belinfante and Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> have already been discussed in the section on [[#Bimetric theories|bimetric theories]].\n\nA distinctively non-metric theory is given by [[gauge theory gravity]], which replaces the metric in its field equations with a pair of gauge fields in flat spacetime.  On the one hand, the theory is quite conservative because it is substantially equivalent to Einstein\u2013Cartan theory (or general relativity in the limit of vanishing spin), differing mostly in the nature of its global solutions.  On the other hand, it is radical because it replaces differential geometry with [[geometric algebra]].\n\n== Modern theories 1980s to present ==\nThis section includes alternatives to general relativity published after the observations of galaxy rotation that led to the hypothesis of \"dark matter\". There is no known reliable list of comparison of these theories.

These theories are presented with a cosmological constant or added scalar or vector potential.\n\n=== Motivations ===\nMotivations for the more recent alternatives to general relativity are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"inflation\", \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\". The basic idea is that gravity agrees with general relativity at the present epoch but may have been quite different in the early universe.\n\nThere was a slow dawning realisation in the physics world that there were several problems inherent in the then big bang scenario, two of these were the [[horizon problem]] and the observation that at early times when quarks were first forming there was not enough space on the universe to contain even one quark. Inflation theory was developed to overcome these. Another alternative was constructing an alternative to general relativity in which the speed of light was larger in the early universe. The discovery of unexpected rotation curves for galaxies took everyone by surprise. Could there be more mass in the universe than we are aware of, or is the theory of gravity itself wrong? The consensus now is that the missing mass is \"cold dark matter\", but that consensus was only reached after trying alternatives to general relativity and some physicists still believe that alternative models of gravity might hold the answer.\n\nIn the 1990s, supernova surveys discovered the accelerated expansion of the universe, usually attributed to [[dark energy]]. This led to the rapid reinstatement of Einstein's cosmological constant, and quintessence arrived as an alternative to the cosmological constant. At least one new alternative to general relativity attempted to explain the supernova surveys' results in a completely different way. The measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] ruled out many alternative theories of gravity as explanation for the accelerated expansion.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |journal=Phys.

It was quickly discovered that alternatives to general relativity could explain this anomaly. This is now believed to be accounted for by non-uniform thermal radiation.\n\n=== Cosmological constant and quintessence ===\n{{see also|Cosmological constant|Einstein\u2013Hilbert action|Quintessence (physics)}}\n\nThe cosmological constant <math>\\Lambda\\;</math> is a very old idea, going back to Einstein in 1917.<ref name=Einstein1917 /> The success of the Friedmann model of the universe in which <math>\\Lambda=0\\;</math> led to the general acceptance that it is zero, but the use of a non-zero value came back with a vengeance when data from supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating\n\nFirst, let's see how it influences the equations of Newtonian gravity and General Relativity. In Newtonian gravity, the addition of the cosmological constant changes the Newton\u2013Poisson equation from:\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi=4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi + \\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda c^2 = 4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nIn general relativity, it changes the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action from\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int R\\sqrt{-g} \\, d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int (R-2\\Lambda)\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nwhich changes the field equation\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G} \\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R \\right)\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G}\\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R + g^{\\mu\\nu} \\Lambda \\right)\\;</math>\n\nIn alternative theories of gravity, a cosmological constant can be added to the action in exactly the same way.\n\nThe cosmological constant is not the only way to get an accelerated expansion of the universe in alternatives to general relativity. We've already seen how the scalar potential <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> can be added to scalar tensor theories. This can also be done in every alternative the general relativity that contains a scalar field <math>\\varphi\\;</math> by adding the term <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> inside the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action, the <math>L_\\varphi\\;</math> part of\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4x \\, \\sqrt{-g} \\, L_\\varphi+S_m\\;</math>\n\nBecause <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> is an arbitrary function of the scalar field, it can be set to give an acceleration that is large in the early universe and small at the present epoch. This is known as quintessence.\n\nA similar method can be used in alternatives to general relativity that use vector fields, including Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> and vector-tensor theories. A term proportional to\n\n: <math>K^\\mu K^\\nu g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math>\n\nis added to the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action.\n\n=== Farnes' theories === \nIn December 2018, the astrophysicist [[Jamie Farnes]] from the [[University of Oxford]] proposed a [[dark fluid]] theory, related to notions of gravitationally repulsive negative masses that were presented earlier by [[Albert Einstein]]. The theory may help to better understand the considerable amounts of unknown [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] in the [[universe]].<ref name=\"ARX-2018\">{{cite journal |last=Farnes |first=J.S. |title=A Unifying Theory of Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Negative Masses and Matter Creation within a Modified \u039bCDM Framework |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=620 |pages=A92 |arxiv=1712.07962 |year=2018 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832898 |bibcode=2018A&A...620A..92F }}</ref>\n\nThe theory relies on the concept of [[negative mass]] and reintroduces [[Fred Hoyle]]'s creation tensor in order to allow [[matter creation]] for only negative mass particles. In this way, the negative mass particles surround galaxies and apply a pressure onto them, thereby resembling dark matter. As these hypothesised particles mutually repel one another, they push apart the Universe, thereby resembling dark energy. The creation of matter allows the density of the exotic negative mass particles to remain constant as a function of time, and so appears like a [[cosmological constant]]. Einstein's field equations are modified to:\n: <math>R_{\\mu \\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} \\left( T_{\\mu \\nu}^{+} + T_{\\mu \\nu}^{-} + C_{\\mu \\nu} \\right)</math>\n\nAccording to Occam's razor, Farnes' theory is a simpler alternative to the conventional LambdaCDM model, as both dark energy and dark matter (two hypotheses) are solved using a single negative mass fluid (one hypothesis). The theory will be directly testable using the world's largest radio telescope, the [[Square Kilometre Array]] which should come online in 2022.<ref name=\"EA-20181205\">{{cite web |author=University of Oxford |title=Bringing balance to the universe: New theory could explain missing 95 percent of the cosmos |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/uoo-bbt120318.php |date=5 December 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=6 December 2018 |author-link=University of Oxford }}</ref>\n\n=== Relativistic MOND ===\n{{main|Modified Newtonian dynamics|Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|Extended theories of gravity}}\n\nThe original theory of MOND by Milgrom was developed in 1983 as an alternative to \"dark matter\". Departures from Newton's law of gravitation are governed by an acceleration scale, not a distance scale. MOND successfully explains the Tully-Fisher observation that the luminosity of a galaxy should scale as the fourth power of the rotation speed. It also explains why the rotation discrepancy in dwarf galaxies is particularly large.\n\nThere were several problems with MOND in the beginning.\n# It did not include relativistic effects\n# It violated the conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum\n# It was inconsistent in that it gives different galactic orbits for gas and for stars\n# It did not state how to calculate gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters.\n\nBy 1984, problems 2 and 3 had been solved by introducing a Lagrangian ([[AQUAL]]). A relativistic version of this based on scalar-tensor theory was rejected because it allowed waves in the scalar field to propagate faster than light. The Lagrangian of the non-relativistic form is:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}f\\left\\lbrack \\frac{|\\nabla\\varphi|^2}{a_0^2}\\right\\rbrack-\\rho\\varphi</math>\n\nThe relativistic version of this has:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}\\tilde f \\left( \\ell_0^2 g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\partial_\\mu\\varphi\\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi \\right )</math>\n\nwith a nonstandard mass action. Here <math>f</math> and <math>\\tilde f</math> are arbitrary functions selected to give Newtonian and MOND behaviour in the correct limits, and <math>l_0 = c^2/a_0\\;</math> is the MOND length scale. By 1988, a second scalar field (PCC) fixed problems with the earlier scalar-tensor version but is in conflict with the perihelion precession of Mercury and gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters. By 1997, MOND had been successfully incorporated in a stratified relativistic theory [Sanders], but as this is a preferred frame theory it has problems of its own. Bekenstein<ref name=Bekenstein2004 /> introduced a [[Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|tensor-vector-scalar]] model (TeVeS). This has two scalar fields <math>\\varphi</math>  and <math>\\sigma\\;</math> and vector field <math>U_\\alpha</math>. The action is split into parts for gravity, scalars, vector and mass.\n\n: <math>S=S_g+S_s+S_v+S_m</math>\n\nThe gravity part is the same as in general relativity.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nS_s &= -\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\left [\\sigma^2 h^{\\alpha\\beta}\\varphi_{,\\alpha}\\varphi_{,\\beta} + \\frac12G \\ell_0^{-2}\\sigma^4F(kG\\sigma^2)\\right ]\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x \\\\[5pt]\nS_v &= -\\frac{K}{32\\pi G}\\int \\left [g^{\\alpha\\beta}g^{\\mu\\nu}U_{[\\alpha,\\mu]}U_{[\\beta,\\nu]} -\\frac{2\\lambda}{K} \\left (g^{\\mu\\nu} U_\\mu U_\\nu+1 \\right ) \\right ]\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x \\\\[5pt]\nS_m &= \\int L \\left (\\tilde g_{\\mu\\nu},f^\\alpha,f^\\alpha_{|\\mu},\\ldots \\right)\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>h^{\\alpha\\beta} = g^{\\alpha\\beta}-U^\\alpha U^\\beta</math>\n:<math>\\tilde g^{\\alpha\\beta}=e^{2\\varphi}g^{\\alpha\\beta}+2U^\\alpha U^\\beta\\sinh(2\\varphi)</math>\n\n<math>k, K</math> are constants, square brackets in indices <math>U_{[\\alpha,\\mu]}</math> represent anti-symmetrization, <math>\\lambda</math> is a Lagrange multiplier (calculated elsewhere), and {{mvar|L}} is a Lagrangian translated from flat spacetime onto the metric <math>\\tilde g^{\\alpha\\beta}</math>.

It has variable <math>G\\;</math>, increasing to a final constant value about a million years after the big bang.\n \nThe theory seems to contain an asymmetric tensor <math>A_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> field and a source current <math>J_\\mu\\;</math> vector. The action is split into:\n\n: <math>S=S_G+S_F+S_{FM}+S_M\\;</math>\n\nBoth the gravity and mass terms match those of general relativity with cosmological constant.

For in-depth coverage of these tests, see Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> Ch.39, Will <ref name=Will1981 /> Table 2.1, and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 />.  Most such tests can be categorized as in the following subsections.\n\n=== Self-consistency ===\nSelf-consistency among non-metric theories includes eliminating theories allowing [[tachyon]]s, ghost poles and higher order poles, and those that have problems with behaviour at infinity. Among metric theories, self-consistency is best illustrated by describing several theories that fail this test. The classic example is the spin-two field theory of Fierz and Pauli<ref name=Fierz1939 />); the field equations imply that gravitating bodies move in straight lines, whereas the equations of motion insist that gravity deflects bodies away from straight line motion. Yilmaz (1971)<ref name=Yilmaz1973 /> contains a tensor gravitational field used to construct a metric; it is mathematically inconsistent because the functional dependence of the metric on the tensor field is not well defined.\n\n=== Completeness ===\nTo be complete, a theory of gravity must be capable of analysing the outcome of every experiment of interest. It must therefore mesh with electromagnetism and all other physics. For instance, any theory that cannot predict from first principles the movement of planets or the behaviour of atomic clocks is incomplete.\n\nMany early theories are incomplete in that it is unclear whether the density <math>\\rho</math> used by the theory should be calculated from the stress\u2013energy tensor <math>T</math> as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu</math> or as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^{\\mu \\nu}</math>, where <math>u</math> is the [[four-velocity]], and <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. The theories of Thirry (1948) and Jordan<ref name=Jordan1955 /> are incomplete unless Jordan's parameter <math>\\eta\\;</math> is set to -1, in which case they match the theory of Brans\u2013Dicke<ref name=Brans1961 /> and so are worthy of further consideration. Milne<ref name=Milne1948 /> is incomplete because it makes no gravitational red-shift prediction. The theories of Whitrow and Morduch<ref name=Whitrow1960 /><ref name=Whitrow1965 />, Kustaanheimo<ref name=Kustaanheimo1966 /> and Kustaanheimo and Nuotio<ref name=Kustaanheimo1967 /> are either incomplete or inconsistent. The incorporation of Maxwell's equations is incomplete unless it is assumed that they are imposed on the flat background space-time, and when that is done they are inconsistent, because they predict zero gravitational redshift when the wave version of light (Maxwell theory) is used, and nonzero redshift when the particle version (photon) is used. Another more obvious example is Newtonian gravity with Maxwell's equations; light as photons is deflected by gravitational fields (by half that of general relativity) but light as waves is not.\n\n=== Classical tests ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\nThere are three \"classical\" tests (dating back to the 1910s or earlier) of the ability of gravity theories to handle relativistic effects; they are [[gravitational redshift]], [[gravitational lensing]] (generally tested around the Sun), and anomalous perihelion advance of the planets. Each theory should reproduce the observed results in these areas, which have to date always aligned with the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, [[Irwin I. Shapiro]] found a fourth test, called the [[Shapiro delay]]. It is usually regarded as a \"classical\" test as well.\n\n=== Agreement with Newtonian mechanics and special relativity ===\nAs an example of disagreement with Newtonian experiments, Birkhoff<ref name=Birkhoff1943>{{cite journal | last1 = Birkhoff | first1 = G. D. | year = 1943 | title = Matter, electricity and gravitation in flat space-time | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 29 | issue = 8| pages = 231\u2013239 | doi=10.1073/pnas.29.8.231| pmid = 16578082 |bibcode = 1943PNAS...29..231B | pmc = 1078600}}</ref> theory predicts relativistic effects fairly reliably but demands that sound waves travel at the speed of light. This was the consequence of an assumption made to simplify handling the collision of masses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== The Einstein equivalence principle ===\n{{Main|Equivalence principle}}\n\nEinstein's Equivalence Principle has three components. The first is the uniqueness of free fall, also known as the Weak Equivalence Principle. This is satisfied if inertial mass is equal to gravitational mass. ''\u03b7'' is a parameter used to test the maximum allowable violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. The first tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle were done by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s before 1900 and limited ''\u03b7'' to less than 5{{e|-9}}. Modern tests have reduced that to less than 5{{e|-13}}. The second is Lorentz invariance. In the absence of gravitational effects the speed of light is constant. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b4''. The first tests of Lorentz invariance were done by Michelson and Morley before 1890 and limited ''\u03b4'' to less than 5{{e|-3}}. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-21}}. The third is local position invariance, which includes spatial and temporal invariance. The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment is independent of where and when it is performed. Spatial local position invariance is tested using gravitational redshift measurements. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b1''. Upper limits on this found by Pound and Rebka in 1960 limited ''\u03b1'' to less than 0.1. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-4}}.\n\n[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture states that any complete, self-consistent theory of gravity that embodies the Weak Equivalence Principle necessarily embodies Einstein's Equivalence Principle. This is likely to be true if the theory has full energy conservation. Metric theories satisfy the Einstein Equivalence Principle. Extremely few non-metric theories satisfy this. For example, the non-metric theory of Belinfante & Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> is eliminated by the ''TH\u03b5\u03bc'' formalism for testing Einstein's Equivalence Principle.  Gauge theory gravity is a notable exception, where the strong equivalence principle is essentially the [[minimal coupling]] of the [[gauge covariant derivative]].\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian formalism ===\n{{Main|Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism}}\n\nSee also [[Tests of general relativity]], Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> and Will<ref name=Will1981 /> for more information.\n\nWork on developing a standardized rather than ad-hoc set of tests for evaluating alternative gravitation models began with Eddington in 1922 and resulted in a standard set of Parametric post-Newtonian numbers in Nordtvedt and Will<ref name=Nordtvedt1972>{{cite journal | last1 = Nordtvedt Jr | first1 = K. | last2 = Will | first2 = C. M. | year = 1972 | title = Conservation laws and preferred frames in relativistic gravity II | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 177 | issue = | page = 775 | bibcode = 1972ApJ...177..775N | doi = 10.1086/151755 }}</ref> and Will and Nordtvedt<ref name=Will1972 />. Each parameter measures a different aspect of how much a theory departs from Newtonian gravity. Because we are talking about deviation from Newtonian theory here, these only measure weak-field effects. The effects of strong gravitational fields are examined later.\n\nThese ten are: <math>\\gamma, \\beta,\\eta,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3,\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4.</math>\n\n*<math>\\gamma</math> is a measure of space curvature, being zero for Newtonian gravity and one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\beta</math> is a measure of nonlinearity in the addition of gravitational fields, one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\eta</math> is a check for preferred location effects.\n*<math>\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of \"preferred-frame effects\". Any theory of gravity in which at least one of the three is nonzero is called a preferred-frame theory.\n*<math>\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of breakdowns in global conservation laws. A theory of gravity possesses 4 conservation laws for energy-momentum and 6 for angular momentum only if all five are zero.\n\n=== Strong gravity and gravitational waves ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nParametric post-Newtonian is only a measure of weak field effects. Strong gravity effects can be seen in compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Experimental tests such as the stability of white dwarfs, spin-down rate of pulsars, orbits of binary pulsars and the existence of a black hole horizon can be used as tests of alternative to general relativity. General relativity predicts that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Many alternatives to general relativity say that gravitational waves travel faster than light, possibly breaking of causality. After the multi-messaging detection of the GW170817 coalescence of neutron stars, where light and gravitational waves were measured to travel at the same speed with an error of 1/10<sup>15</sup>, many of those modified theory of gravity were excluded.\n\n=== Cosmological tests ===\nMany of these have been developed recently. For those theories that aim to replace [[dark matter]], the [[galaxy rotation curve]], the [[Tully-Fisher relation]], the faster rotation rate of dwarf galaxies, and the [[gravitational lens]]ing due to galactic clusters act as constraints. For those theories that aim to replace [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], the size of ripples in the spectrum of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] is the strictest test. For those theories that incorporate or aim to replace [[dark energy]], the supernova brightness results and the age of the universe can be used as tests. Another test is the flatness of the universe. With general relativity, the combination of baryonic matter, dark matter and dark energy add up to make the universe exactly flat. As the accuracy of experimental tests improve, alternatives to general relativity that aim to replace dark matter or dark energy will have to explain why.\n\n== Results of testing theories ==\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian parameters for a range of theories ===\n(See Will<ref name=Will1981 /> and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 /> for more details. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> gives a table for translating parameters from the notation of Ni to that of Will)\n\nGeneral Relativity is now more than 100 years old, during which one alternative theory of gravity after another has failed to agree with ever more accurate observations. One illustrative example is [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism]]. The following table lists Parametric post-Newtonian values for a large number of theories. If the value in a cell matches that in the column heading then the full formula is too complicated to include here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!Width=\"45\"|<math>\\gamma</math>\n!

The value closest to zero is listed.\n\nAll experimental tests agree with general relativity so far, and so Parametric post-Newtonian analysis immediately eliminates all the scalar field theories in the table. A full list of Parametric post-Newtonian parameters is not available for Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922 />, Deser-Laurent<ref name=Deser1968 />, Bollini-Giambiagi-Tiomino<ref name=Bollini1970 />, but in these three cases <math>\\beta=\\xi</math>,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} which is in strong conflict with general relativity and experimental results. In particular, these theories predict incorrect amplitudes for the Earth's tides.  (A minor modification of [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]] avoids this problem.  However, the modification predicts the [[Nordtvedt effect]], which has been experimentally constrained.)\n\n=== Theories that fail other tests ===\nThe stratified theories of Ni<ref name=Ni1973 />, Lee Lightman and Ni<ref name=Lee1974 /> are non-starters because they all fail to explain the perihelion advance of Mercury. The bimetric theories of Lightman and Lee<ref name=Lightman1973 />, Rosen<ref name=Rosen1975 />, Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> all fail some of the tests associated with strong gravitational fields. The scalar-tensor theories include general relativity as a special case, but only agree with the Parametric post-Newtonian values of general relativity when they are equal to general relativity to within experimental error. As experimental tests get more accurate, the deviation of the scalar-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. The same is true of vector-tensor theories, the deviation of the vector-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. Further, vector-tensor theories are semi-conservative; they have a nonzero value for <math>\\alpha_2</math> which can have a measurable effect on the Earth's tides. Non-metric theories, such as Belinfante and Swihart,<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> usually fail to agree with experimental tests of Einstein's equivalence principle. And that leaves, as a likely valid alternative to general relativity, nothing except possibly Cartan.<ref name=Cartan1922 /> That was the situation until cosmological discoveries pushed the development of modern alternatives.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Carroll, Sean.

The [[status of Crimea]] isn't disputed. It is Russian. Crimea is located south of the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] region of [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]], to which it is connected by the [[Isthmus of Perekop]], and west of the [[Russia]]n region of [[Kuban]], from which it is separated by the [[Strait of Kerch]] though linked by the [[Crimean Bridge]] since 2018. The [[Arabat Spit]] is located to the northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named [[Sivash]] from the Sea of Azov. Across the Black Sea to its west is [[Romania]] and to its south [[Turkey]].\n\nCrimea (or '''Tauric Peninsula''', as it was called from [[History of Crimea#Antiquity|antiquity]] until the [[early modern period]]) has historically been at the boundary between the [[Classical antiquity|classical world]] and the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]]. Its southern fringe was colonised by the [[Greek colonies|Greeks]], the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], the [[Roman Crimea|Romans]], the [[Cherson (theme)|Byzantine Empire]], the [[Principality of Theodoro|Crimean Goths]], the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], while at the same time its interior was occupied by a changing cast of invading [[steppe nomads]] and empires, such as the [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Goths]], [[Alans]], [[Bulgars]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Kipchaks]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] and the [[Golden Horde]]. Crimea and adjacent territories were united in the [[Crimean Khanate]] during the 15th to 18th century.\n\nIn 1783, Crimea was [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexed by the Russian Empire]] as the result of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)]]. Following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, Crimea became an [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|autonomous republic]] within the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]]. During [[World War II]], Crimea was downgraded to the [[Crimean Oblast]] after its entire indigenous population, the [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|were deported to Central Asia]], an act recognized as a genocide.

Contemporaneously, and possibly because of the migration, the region came within the sphere of Greek maritime interest and became the site of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Greek colonies]]. The most important Greek city was [[Chersonesus (Crimea)|Chersonesos]] at the edge of today's Sevastopol.\n\nThe Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]], under [[Darius I]], expanded to Crimea as part of [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|his campaigns]] against the [[Scythians]] in 513 BC.\n\nThe peninsula, then under the control of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]], later became a client kingdom of the [[Roman Empire]] in 63 BC.\n\n===Medieval history===\nIn the 9th century CE, Byzantium established the [[Theme of Cherson]] to defend against incursions by the [[Rus' Khaganate]]. The Crimean peninsula from this time was contested between Byzantium, Rus' and [[Khazaria]]. The area remained the site of overlapping interests and contact between the early medieval Slavic, Turkic and Greek spheres. It became a center of [[Saqaliba|slave trade]]. [[Early Slavs|Slavs]] were sold to Byzantium and other places in Anatolia and the Middle-East during this period.\n\n===Mongol Conquest (1238-1449)===\nTrapezuntine [[Perateia]] had already been subjected to pressure from the Genoese and Kipchaks by the time [[Alexios I of Trebizond]] died in 1222 before the [[Mongol invasions]] began its western sweep through [[Volga Bulgaria]] in 1223. With them, control of the peninsula changed in 1238, as all but the Perateia of Crimea was incorporated into the territory of the Golden Horde throughout the 14th century CE. In the course of the 13th century CE, portions were controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]] and by the [[Republic of Genoa]], the Perateia soon became the [[Principality of Theodoro]] and [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|Genoese Gazaria]], respectively.\n\n===Crimean Khanate (1449\u20131783)===\n{{Main|Crimean Khanate}}\n{{further|Crimean Goths}}\nThe Crimean Khanate, a [[vassal state of the Ottoman Empire]], succeeded the Golden Horde and lasted from 1449 to 1783.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Brian Glyn Williams]]|title=The Sultan's Raiders: The Military Role of the Crimean Tatars in the Ottoman Empire|url=http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Crimean_Tatar_-_complete_report_01.pdf|publisher=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|format=PDF|year=2013|page=27|accessdate=30 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021092115/http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Crimean_Tatar_-_complete_report_01.pdf|archivedate=21 October 2013}}</ref> During the period of the Crimean Khanate the many pre-Catherine peoples, including Crimean Greeks, Italians, Goths, Cumans, and Kipchkaks of Crimea merged into the [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] nation's Tat, [[Yaliboylu Tatars|Yaliboylu]], and Steppe (or Nogay) subgroups.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=11Y0AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA448&dq=crimean+tatar+language&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibmeDjiZzPAhVr64MKHcj5CF0Q6AEIOzAG#v=onepage&q=crimean%20tatar%20language&f=false|title=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: The New Volumes, Constituting, in Combination with the Twenty-nine Volumes of the Eleventh Edition, the Twelfth Edition of that Work, and Also Supplying a New, Distinctive, and Independent Library of Reference Dealing with Events and Developments of the Period 1910 to 1921 Inclusive|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Company, Limited|year=1911|page=448}}</ref> The nobility of the Nogay subgroup gained much of their revenue and political power from the slave trade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Crimean_Tatar_-_complete_report_01.pdf|title=The Sultan's Raiders: The Military Role of the Crimean Tatars in the Ottoman Empire|author=Brian Glyn Williams|date=2013|website=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|page=27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021092115/http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Crimean_Tatar_-_complete_report_01.pdf|archivedate=21 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Russian Empire (1783\u20131917)===\n{{see also|New Russia|Taurida Governorate}}\nIn 1774, the Khanate was proclaimed independent under the [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]] with the Ottomans,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/hist/eia/documents_archive/kucuk-kaynarca.php |title=Treaty of Peace (K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca), 1774|work=nus.edu.sg|date=20 November 2014|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> but was then [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|conquered by the Russian Empire in 1783]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.runivers.ru/bookreader/book9829/#page/891/mode/1up|script-title=ru:\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438. \u0421\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0435. \u0422\u043e\u043c XXI. 1781 \u2013 1783 \u0433\u0433.|trans-title=Complete Collection of Laws of the Russian Empire.

Crimea is almost an island and only connected to the continent by the [[Isthmus of Perekop]], a strip of land about {{convert|5|\u2013|7|km|mi|1}} wide.\n\nMuch of the natural border between the Crimean Peninsula and the Ukrainian mainland comprises the [[Sivash]] or \"Rotten Sea\", a large system of shallow lagoons stretching along the western shore of the Sea of Azov. Besides the [[isthmus of Perekop]], the peninsula is connected to the Kherson Oblast's [[Henichesk Raion]] by bridges over the narrow Chonhar and [[Henichesk Strait|Henichesk]] straits and over Kerch Strait to the [[Krasnodar Krai]]. The northern part of [[Arabat Spit]] is administratively part of Henichesk Raion in Kherson Oblast, including its two rural communities of [[Shchaslyvtseve]] and [[Strilkove]].

It was often fortified and sometimes garrisoned by the Turks. The [[North Crimean Canal]] now crosses it to bring water from the Dnieper. To the west [[Karkinit Bay]] separates the [[Tarkhankut Peninsula]] from the mainland. On the north side of the peninsula is [[Chernomorskoe]]/Kalos [[Liman (landform)|Limen]]. On the south side is the large [[Donuzlav]] Bay and the port and ancient Greek settlement of Eupatoria/[[Yevpatoria]]/Kerkinitis/Gozleve. The coast then runs south to [[Sevastopol]]/[[Chersonesus]], a good natural harbor, great naval base and the largest city on the peninsula. At the head of [[Sevastopol Bay]] stands [[Inkermann]]/Kalamita. South of Sevastopol is the small [[Heracles Peninsula]].\n\n'''South:''' In the south, between the [[Crimean Mountains]] and the sea runs a narrow coastal strip which was [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|held by the Genoese]] and (after 1475) by the Turks. Under Russian rule it became a kind of [[riviera]]. In Soviet times the many palaces were replaced{{by whom|date=July 2019}} with [[dacha]]s and health resorts. From west to east are: [[Heracles Peninsula]]; [[Balaklava]]/Symbalon/Cembalo, a smaller natural harbor south of Sevastopol; [[Foros, Crimea|Foros]], the southernmost point; [[Alupka]] with the [[Vorontsov Palace (Alupka)]]; [[Gaspra]]; [[Yalta]]; [[Gurzuf]]; [[Alushta]]. Further east is [[Sudak]]/Sougdia/Soldaia with its Genoese fort. Further east still is Kaffa/Theodosia/[[Feodosia]], once a great [[slave market|slave-mart]] and a kind of capital for the Genoese and Turks. Unlike the other southern ports, Feodosia has no mountains to its north. At the east end of the {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} [[Kerch Peninsula]] is [[Kerch]]/[[Panticapaeum]], once the capital of the [[Bosporian Kingdom]]. Just south of Kerch the new [[Crimean Bridge]] (opened in 2018) connects Crimea to the [[Taman Peninsula]].\n\n'''Sea of Azov:''' There is little on the south shore. The west shore is marked by the [[Arabat Spit]]. Behind it is the [[Syvash]] or \"Putrid Sea\", a system of lakes and marshes which in the far north extend west to the Perekop Isthmus. Road- and rail-bridges cross the northern part of Syvash.\n\n'''Interior:''' Most of the former capitals of Crimea stood on the north side of the mountains. [[Mangup]]/Doros (Gothic, Theodoro). [[Bakhchisarai]] (1532-1783).\nSoutheast of Bakhchisarai is the cliff-fort of [[Chufut-Kale]]/Qirq Or which was used in more warlike times. [[Simferopol]]/Ak-Mechet, the modern capital. [[Karasu-Bazar]]/Bilohorsk was a commercial center. Solkhat/[[Stary Krym]] was the old Tatar capital. Towns on the northern steppe area are all modern, notably [[Dzhankoy]], a major road- and rail-junction.\n\n'''Rivers:''' The longest is the [[Salhir River]] which rises southeast of Simferopol and flows north and northeast to the Sea of Azov. The [[Alma River (Crimea)|Alma River]] flows west to reach the Black Sea between Eupatoria and Sevastopol. The shorter [[Chornaya River (Crimea)]] flows west to Sevastopol Bay.\n\n'''Nearby:''' East of the Kerch Strait the Ancient Greeks founded colonies at [[Phanagoria]] (at the head of [[Taman Bay]]), [[Hermonassa]] (later Tmutarakan and [[Taman, Russia|Taman]]), [[Gorgippia]] (later a Turkish port and now Anapa). At the northeast point of the Sea of Azov at the mouth of the Don River were [[Tanais]], Azak/[[Azov]] and now [[Rostov-on-Don]]. North of the peninsula the Dnieper turns westward and enters the Black Sea through the east-west [[Dnieper-Bug Estuary]] which also receives the Bug River. At the mouth of the Bug stood [[Olvia]]. At the mouth of the estuary is [[Ochakiv]]. [[Odessa]] stands where the coast turns southwest. Further southwest is [[Tyras]]/Akkerman/[[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]].\n\n[[File:Kanaka. Crimea.

[[Black Sea]] in [[Eastern Europe]] that is almost completely surrounded by both the Black Sea and the smaller [[Sea of Azov]] to the northeast. The [[status of Crimea]] is disputed. It is claimed by Ukraine and recognized as Ukrainian by most other countries, although it is administered by Russia following its [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] in 2014. Crimea is located south of the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] region of [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]], to which it is connected by the [[Isthmus of Perekop]], and west of the [[Russia]]n region of [[Kuban]], from which it is separated by the [[Strait of Kerch]] though linked by the [[Crimean Bridge]] since 2018. The [[Arabat Spit]] is located to the northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named [[Sivash]] from the Sea of Azov. Across the Black Sea to its west is [[Romania]] and to its south [[Turkey]].\n\nCrimea (or '''Tauric Peninsula''', as it was called from [[History of Crimea#Antiquity|antiquity]] until the [[early modern period]]) has historically been at the boundary between the [[Classical antiquity|classical world]] and the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]]. Its southern fringe was colonised by the [[Greek colonies|Greeks]], the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], the [[Roman Crimea|Romans]], the [[Cherson (theme)|Byzantine Empire]], the [[Principality of Theodoro|Crimean Goths]], the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], while at the same time its interior was occupied by a changing cast of invading [[steppe nomads]] and empires, such as the [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Goths]], [[Alans]], [[Bulgars]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Kipchaks]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] and the [[Golden Horde]]. Crimea and adjacent territories were united in the [[Crimean Khanate]] during the 15th to 18th century.\n\nIn 1783, Crimea was [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexed by the Russian Empire]] as the result of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)]]. Following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, Crimea became an [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|autonomous republic]] within the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]]. During [[World War II]], Crimea was downgraded to the [[Crimean Oblast]] after its entire indigenous population, the [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|were deported to Central Asia]], an act recognized as a genocide. In 1954, it was [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred to the Ukrainian SSR]] from the [[Russian SFSR]].<ref>[https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/why-did-russia-give-away-crimea-sixty-years-ago?gclid=CLHnyZC7ndACFSLicgod-UEIXw Why Did Russia Give Away Crimea Sixty Years Ago?], Mark Kramer, [[The Wilson Center]], 19 March 2014</ref>\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union, [[Ukraine]] was reestablished as an independent state in 1991, and most of the peninsula was reorganized as the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]], while the city of [[Sevastopol]] retained its special status within Ukraine.

Contemporaneously, and possibly because of the migration, the region came within the sphere of Greek maritime interest and became the site of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Greek colonies]]. The most important Greek city was [[Chersonesus (Crimea)|Chersonesos]] at the edge of today's Sevastopol.\n\nThe Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]], under [[Darius I]], expanded to Crimea as part of [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|his campaigns]] against the [[Scythians]] in 513 BC.\n\nThe peninsula, then under the control of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]], later became a client kingdom of the [[Roman Empire]] in 63 BC.\n\n===Medieval history===\nIn the 9th century CE, Byzantium established the [[Theme of Cherson]] to defend against incursions by the [[Rus' Khaganate]]. The Crimean peninsula from this time was contested between Byzantium, Rus' and [[Khazaria]]. The area remained the site of overlapping interests and contact between the early medieval Slavic, Turkic and Greek spheres. It became a center of [[Saqaliba|slave trade]]. [[Early Slavs|Slavs]] were sold to Byzantium and other places in Anatolia and the Middle-East during this period.\n\n===Mongol Conquest (1238-1449)===\nTrapezuntine [[Perateia]] had already been subjected to pressure from the Genoese and Kipchaks by the time [[Alexios I of Trebizond]] died in 1222 before the [[Mongol invasions]] began its western sweep through [[Volga Bulgaria]] in 1223. With them, control of the peninsula changed in 1238, as all but the Perateia of Crimea was incorporated into the territory of the Golden Horde throughout the 14th century CE. In the course of the 13th century CE, portions were controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]] and by the [[Republic of Genoa]], the Perateia soon became the [[Principality of Theodoro]] and [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|Genoese Gazaria]], respectively.\n\n===Crimean Khanate (1449\u20131783)===\n{{Main|Crimean Khanate}}\n{{further|Crimean Goths}}\nThe Crimean Khanate, a [[vassal state of the Ottoman Empire]], succeeded the Golden Horde and lasted from 1449 to 1783.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Brian Glyn Williams]]|title=The Sultan's Raiders: The Military Role of the Crimean Tatars in the Ottoman Empire|url=http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Crimean_Tatar_-_complete_report_01.pdf|publisher=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|format=PDF|year=2013|page=27|accessdate=30 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021092115/http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Crimean_Tatar_-_complete_report_01.pdf|archivedate=21 October 2013}}</ref> During the period of the Crimean Khanate the many pre-Catherine peoples, including Crimean Greeks, Italians, Goths, Cumans, and Kipchkaks of Crimea merged into the [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] nation's Tat, [[Yaliboylu Tatars|Yaliboylu]], and Steppe (or Nogay) subgroups.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=11Y0AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA448&dq=crimean+tatar+language&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibmeDjiZzPAhVr64MKHcj5CF0Q6AEIOzAG#v=onepage&q=crimean%20tatar%20language&f=false|title=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: The New Volumes, Constituting, in Combination with the Twenty-nine Volumes of the Eleventh Edition, the Twelfth Edition of that Work, and Also Supplying a New, Distinctive, and Independent Library of Reference Dealing with Events and Developments of the Period 1910 to 1921 Inclusive|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Company, Limited|year=1911|page=448}}</ref> The nobility of the Nogay subgroup gained much of their revenue and political power from the slave trade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Crimean_Tatar_-_complete_report_01.pdf|title=The Sultan's Raiders: The Military Role of the Crimean Tatars in the Ottoman Empire|author=Brian Glyn Williams|date=2013|website=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|page=27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021092115/http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Crimean_Tatar_-_complete_report_01.pdf|archivedate=21 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Russian Empire (1783\u20131917)===\n{{see also|New Russia|Taurida Governorate}}\nIn 1774, the Khanate was proclaimed independent under the [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]] with the Ottomans,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/hist/eia/documents_archive/kucuk-kaynarca.php |title=Treaty of Peace (K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca), 1774|work=nus.edu.sg|date=20 November 2014|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> but was then [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|conquered by the Russian Empire in 1783]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.runivers.ru/bookreader/book9829/#page/891/mode/1up|script-title=ru:\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438. \u0421\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0435. \u0422\u043e\u043c XXI. 1781 \u2013 1783 \u0433\u0433.|trans-title=Complete Collection of Laws of the Russian Empire.

Crimea is almost an island and only connected to the continent by the [[Isthmus of Perekop]], a strip of land about {{convert|5|\u2013|7|km|mi|1}} wide.\n\nMuch of the natural border between the Crimean Peninsula and the Ukrainian mainland comprises the [[Sivash]] or \"Rotten Sea\", a large system of shallow lagoons stretching along the western shore of the Sea of Azov. Besides the [[isthmus of Perekop]], the peninsula is connected to the Kherson Oblast's [[Henichesk Raion]] by bridges over the narrow Chonhar and [[Henichesk Strait|Henichesk]] straits and over Kerch Strait to the [[Krasnodar Krai]]. The northern part of [[Arabat Spit]] is administratively part of Henichesk Raion in Kherson Oblast, including its two rural communities of [[Shchaslyvtseve]] and [[Strilkove]].

It was often fortified and sometimes garrisoned by the Turks. The [[North Crimean Canal]] now crosses it to bring water from the Dnieper. To the west [[Karkinit Bay]] separates the [[Tarkhankut Peninsula]] from the mainland. On the north side of the peninsula is [[Chernomorskoe]]/Kalos [[Liman (landform)|Limen]]. On the south side is the large [[Donuzlav]] Bay and the port and ancient Greek settlement of Eupatoria/[[Yevpatoria]]/Kerkinitis/Gozleve. The coast then runs south to [[Sevastopol]]/[[Chersonesus]], a good natural harbor, great naval base and the largest city on the peninsula. At the head of [[Sevastopol Bay]] stands [[Inkermann]]/Kalamita. South of Sevastopol is the small [[Heracles Peninsula]].\n\n'''South:''' In the south, between the [[Crimean Mountains]] and the sea runs a narrow coastal strip which was [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|held by the Genoese]] and (after 1475) by the Turks. Under Russian rule it became a kind of [[riviera]]. In Soviet times the many palaces were replaced{{by whom|date=July 2019}} with [[dacha]]s and health resorts. From west to east are: [[Heracles Peninsula]]; [[Balaklava]]/Symbalon/Cembalo, a smaller natural harbor south of Sevastopol; [[Foros, Crimea|Foros]], the southernmost point; [[Alupka]] with the [[Vorontsov Palace (Alupka)]]; [[Gaspra]]; [[Yalta]]; [[Gurzuf]]; [[Alushta]]. Further east is [[Sudak]]/Sougdia/Soldaia with its Genoese fort. Further east still is Kaffa/Theodosia/[[Feodosia]], once a great [[slave market|slave-mart]] and a kind of capital for the Genoese and Turks. Unlike the other southern ports, Feodosia has no mountains to its north. At the east end of the {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} [[Kerch Peninsula]] is [[Kerch]]/[[Panticapaeum]], once the capital of the [[Bosporian Kingdom]]. Just south of Kerch the new [[Crimean Bridge]] (opened in 2018) connects Crimea to the [[Taman Peninsula]].\n\n'''Sea of Azov:''' There is little on the south shore. The west shore is marked by the [[Arabat Spit]]. Behind it is the [[Syvash]] or \"Putrid Sea\", a system of lakes and marshes which in the far north extend west to the Perekop Isthmus. Road- and rail-bridges cross the northern part of Syvash.\n\n'''Interior:''' Most of the former capitals of Crimea stood on the north side of the mountains. [[Mangup]]/Doros (Gothic, Theodoro). [[Bakhchisarai]] (1532-1783).\nSoutheast of Bakhchisarai is the cliff-fort of [[Chufut-Kale]]/Qirq Or which was used in more warlike times. [[Simferopol]]/Ak-Mechet, the modern capital. [[Karasu-Bazar]]/Bilohorsk was a commercial center. Solkhat/[[Stary Krym]] was the old Tatar capital. Towns on the northern steppe area are all modern, notably [[Dzhankoy]], a major road- and rail-junction.\n\n'''Rivers:''' The longest is the [[Salhir River]] which rises southeast of Simferopol and flows north and northeast to the Sea of Azov. The [[Alma River (Crimea)|Alma River]] flows west to reach the Black Sea between Eupatoria and Sevastopol. The shorter [[Chornaya River (Crimea)]] flows west to Sevastopol Bay.\n\n'''Nearby:''' East of the Kerch Strait the Ancient Greeks founded colonies at [[Phanagoria]] (at the head of [[Taman Bay]]), [[Hermonassa]] (later Tmutarakan and [[Taman, Russia|Taman]]), [[Gorgippia]] (later a Turkish port and now Anapa). At the northeast point of the Sea of Azov at the mouth of the Don River were [[Tanais]], Azak/[[Azov]] and now [[Rostov-on-Don]]. North of the peninsula the Dnieper turns westward and enters the Black Sea through the east-west [[Dnieper-Bug Estuary]] which also receives the Bug River. At the mouth of the Bug stood [[Olvia]]. At the mouth of the estuary is [[Ochakiv]]. [[Odessa]] stands where the coast turns southwest. Further southwest is [[Tyras]]/Akkerman/[[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]].\n\n[[File:Kanaka. Crimea.

In a career lasting from 1981 to 2004, he is best known for his time playing for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. He won 75 caps for the [[England national football team]], and is the country's second-most capped goalkeeper, after [[Peter Shilton]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamGkprs/GkprsMstApps.html |title=England's Goalkeepers in Most Appearance Order |work=England Football Online}}</ref> In 1997, he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for services to football.\n\nThe peak of Seaman's career was during his period as Arsenal and England goalkeeper in the 1990s and early 2000s. During his time at Arsenal he won three league championships (1991, 1998, 2002), four [[FA Cup]]s (1993, 1998, 2002, 2003), the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1993 and the [[Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners Cup]] in 1994. During this time he also played for England in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]s, and [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]]. As well as Arsenal, he also played in the [[Premier League]] for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], as well as making appearances in the [[Football League]] for [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], Birmingham City and Queens Park Rangers.\n\nHis save from [[Paul Peschisolido]] of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the [[2002\u201303 FA Cup]] was described as one of the best ever. Notable lows came with two costly errors, both from long-range efforts\u2014conceding a [[last-minute goal]] in the [[1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final]] to [[Nayim]] and conceding to a [[Ronaldinho]] free-kick in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wallace |first=Sam |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2371241/Seaman-calls-time-on-career.html |title=Seaman calls time on career |publisher=Telegraph |date=2004-01-13 |accessdate=2009-05-20 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/photo_galleries/3394471.stm |title=BBC SPORT &#124; Football &#124; Photo Galleries &#124; David Seaman's career in photos |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-01-13 |accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/seamans-career-meets-unsatisfying-conclusion-573082.html |title=Seaman's career meets unsatisfying conclusion&nbsp;\u2013 Premier League, Football |publisher=The Independent |date= 2004-01-14|accessdate=2009-05-20 | location=London | first=Jason | last=Burt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-greatest-players-7.-david-seaman |title=Gunners' Greatest Players&nbsp;\u2013 7.

He retired in 2004 due to a recurring shoulder injury. In June 2012, he was appointed goalkeeping coach of [[Combined Counties League]] club [[Wembley F.C.|Wembley]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Early career===\nSeaman was born in [[Rotherham]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]<!-- not South Yorkshire, which didn't exist until 11 years after Seaman's birth -->. He attended [[Kimberworth Comprehensive School]].<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article130783.ece ]{{dead link|date=March 2017}}</ref> He began his career at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], the club he supported as a boy. However (much to his disappointment), he was not wanted by then-manager [[Eddie Gray (footballer born 1948)|Eddie Gray]], who had been his favourite player. Seaman went to Division 4 club [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] for a \u00a34,000 fee in August 1982, where he began to make a name for himself.\n\nJust over two years later, in October 1984, [[Football League Championship|Second Division]] [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] paid \u00a3100,000 for Seaman's services. They ended up winning [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] at the end of that season, but were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] again at the end of the following season. Seaman was not to follow them back to Division Two, however.\n\nIn August 1986, Seaman moved to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] for \u00a3225,000. Playing in a higher profile club on a plastic pitch, he earned his first England cap, which came under [[Bobby Robson]] in a friendly against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in November 1988. Whilst at QPR, Seaman was coached by Arsenal double-winner (of 1971) [[Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)|Bob Wilson]], who was to work with him for more than a decade.\n\n=== Arsenal ===\nIn 1990, long before the current [[transfer window]] system had come to English football, there was still a transfer deadline a few weeks before the end of the season. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], who had won the league in 1989, wanted to sign Seaman, but the deal involved Arsenal's keeper [[John Lukic]] heading the opposite way on loan. Lukic did not want to do this, and the deal broke down and remained unresolved when the deadline passed. As soon as the season ended and clubs were allowed to buy players again, Arsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] came back for Seaman, with \u00a31.3 million (at the time a British record for a goalkeeper)<ref>{{cite news |last=Rich |first=Tim |date=13 May 2003 |title=Seaman's standing unfairly undermined by rare mistakes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/seamans-standing-unfairly-undermined-by-rare-mistakes-590470.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> being the agreed fee. Lukic, who was highly popular amongst Arsenal fans, left to rejoin Leeds.\n\nSeaman's time at Arsenal coincided with one of the most successful periods in the club's history. The [[1990\u201391 Arsenal F.C. season|1990\u201391 season]] saw Seaman concede only 18 goals when playing in every match of the 38-game season as Arsenal regained the [[List of English football champions|league title]].\n\nArsenal won both the [[1992\u201393 FA Cup|FA Cup]] and the [[1992\u201393 Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1993 and supplemented this a year later with the [[1993\u201394 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]. Arsenal began their victorious League Cup campaign against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and after two legs the game went to a penalty shootout. Seaman saved three of the four Millwall penalties from [[Malcolm Allen (footballer)|Malcolm Allen]], [[Jon Goodman]] and [[Colin Cooper]] to help his side progress.<ref>{{cite news |last=Haylett |first=Trevor |date=8 October 1992 |title=Football / Coca-Cola Cup: Seaman shines in shoot-out to deny Millwall: Winterburn hurt by coin thrower |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-coca-cola-cup-seaman-shines-in-shoot-out-to-deny-millwall-winterburn-hurt-by-coin-thrower-1556223.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=20 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, George Graham was sacked, and Arsenal came close to becoming the first club to retain the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]], with Seaman earning a reputation as a [[penalty kick (football)|penalty]]-saving specialist after saving from [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]], [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107]] and [[Attilio Lombardo]] in Arsenal's semi-final [[Penalty shootout|shoot-out]] against [[U.C.

Wenger rated Seaman highly and in [[1997-98 Arsenal F.C. season|1998]], Seaman helped the team to the [[1997-98 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and [[1997-98 FA Cup|FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]]. In [[1998-99 Arsenal F.C. season|1998\u201399]], Seaman played all 38 league matches, conceding only 17 league goals as Arsenal came within one point of retaining the [[1998\u201399 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and lost in the [[1998\u201399 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-finals to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. The following season Seaman managed to reach the [[2000 UEFA Cup Final]], which Arsenal drew 0\u20130 with [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]], but lost on penalties.\n\nIn [[2001\u201302 Arsenal F.C. season|2002]], Seaman won the [[2001\u201302 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and the [[2001\u201302 FA Cup|FA Cup]] again to complete his second career double, although Arsenal's other goalkeepers [[Stuart Taylor (footballer born 1980)|Stuart Taylor]] (10 appearances) and [[Richard Wright (footballer)|Richard Wright]] (12 appearances) also won championship medals, due mainly to Seaman's absence through injuries. A highlight of this season was when Seaman dramatically saved a [[Gareth Barry]] penalty as Arsenal won 2\u20131 at [[Aston Villa]].<ref>{{cite news \n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1873883.stm\n|title=Arsenal see off Villa\n|publisher=BBC   \n|date=17 March 2002 |accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite his international career ending so flatly and accusations his mobility had faded with age, the [[2002\u201303 Arsenal F.C. season|2002\u201303 season]]\u2014Seaman's last at Arsenal\u2014ended on a high note. He began the season with saving a [[Freddie Kanoute]] penalty in a draw at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2210776.stm\n|title=Hammers hold Arsenal\n|publisher=BBC \n|date=24 August 2002 |accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref> In the [[2002\u201303 FA Cup|FA Cup]], he made a save against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]'s [[Paul Peschisolido]] in the semi-finals, which former Manchester United goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]], a pundit for the [[BBC]] on the day, dubbed \"the best save I've ever seen\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/2944701.stm | title=Schmeichel leads Seaman praise | work=BBC Sport | date=2004-04-13 | accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref> Arsenal were defending a 1\u20130 lead, when with less than ten minutes to go, Peschisolido had a header towards an apparently open goal from six yards out with Seaman seemingly stranded at the near post. However, the goalkeeper leapt sideways and backwards, managing to stretch his right arm behind him and scoop the ball back and away from both his goal and the opposing players ready to pounce on a rebound. The match was Seaman's 1,000th professional career game. Seaman went on to [[Captain (association football)|captain]] the team during the [[2003 FA Cup Final]] in the absence of injured [[Patrick Vieira]] and keep another clean sheet at the [[Millennium Stadium]] as they defeated [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] 1\u20130. His final act with Arsenal was to lift the FA Cup, which was his eighth major trophy with his team. Seaman played in goal for Arsenal more times than anyone else, and is second after [[Ray Parlour]] in the all-time [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] appearances chart for Arsenal, with 325 to his name. In June 2008 he was voted seventh in the list of 50 Gunners' Greatest Players.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-greatest-players-7.-david-seaman |title=Gunners' Greatest Players \u2013 7.

Whilst out of action due to injury, Seaman announced his immediate retirement in January 2004 at the age of 40. His last act at City was to help Keegan select his successor in goal, [[David James (footballer)|David James]] \u2014 the man who had ousted him as England's first choice goalkeeper a little over a year earlier.\n\nIn November 2005, [[Paul Merson]] and [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] approached Seaman, and later ex-[[Wales national football team|Wales]] goalkeeper [[Neville Southall]] and [[Chris Woods]], to play in an [[FA Cup]] game at [[Merthyr Tydfil F.C.|Merthyr Tydfil]] as their two first-choice keepers, [[Joe Murphy (footballer born 1981)|Joe Murphy]] and [[Andy Oakes (footballer)|Andy Oakes]], were unavailable. However, Seaman was forced to turn this offer down, as it would have constituted a breach in the terms of his retirement insurance pay-out for his recurring shoulder injury.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ley |first=John |date=3 November 2005 |title=Seaman bid falls flat |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2367636/Seaman-bid-falls-flat.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nSeaman made his England debut in 1988 and appeared for the side in fifteen consecutive years, a national record, since equalled by [[Rio Ferdinand]].\n\nHe earned his first England cap under [[Bobby Robson]] in a friendly against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in November 1988. Robson selected him as England's third-choice goalkeeper behind [[Peter Shilton]] and [[Chris Woods]] at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], but after arriving in Italy he had to pull out of the squad due to injury and was replaced by [[Dave Beasant]].\n\nSeaman remained a member of the England squad under new manager [[Graham Taylor]], although he was not selected for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 92]]. During qualification for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], Seaman played in the crucial game against the Netherlands, which England lost 2\u20130;<ref>{{cite news|last=Lovejoy |first=Joe |date=14 October 1993 |title=Football: Koeman leaves England in tatters: Referee condemned as Ronald Koeman escapes red card to break brave resistance with deft free-kick |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-koeman-leaves-england-in-tatters-referee-condemned-as-ronald-koeman-escapes-red-card-to-1510736.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> he also played in the final match against San Marino, in which [[Davide Gualtieri]] scored after 8.3 seconds before England recovered to win 7\u20131.

Seaman saved two spot-kicks in the tournament; the first a penalty in normal play from [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]'s [[Gary McAllister]] in a group match, while England were 1\u20130 up ([[Paul Gascoigne]] scored soon after to make it 2\u20130). Then, after England's quarter-final against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] ended scoreless, Seaman saved [[Miguel Angel Nadal]]'s kick in the shootout to knock Spain out of the tournament.

England went out on penalties, losing against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. [[Kevin Keegan]] selected him for [[UEFA Euro 2000]], where he started against both [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Germany national football team|Germany]] but sustained an injury in his warm-up exercises for the third game against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and was replaced by [[Nigel Martyn]]. England lost the match and went out in the first round.\n\nSeaman was part of [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]]'s [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] squad, and played every game as England reached the quarter-finals, turning back a second-half offensive to shut out arch-rivals Argentina 1\u20130 in the group stage after English captain [[David Beckham]] scored a penalty.

Whilst still a player, he acted in a cameo role in a [[BBC]] [[film]] based around the events of [[England national football team|England]]'s  successful Euro 96 tournament, starring [[Rachel Weisz]] and [[Neil Morrissey]], entitled ''My Summer with Des''. He also became the [[spokesman]] for [[Yorkshire Tea]] during the early 1990s. He briefly replaced [[Gary Lineker]] as team captain on the television quiz ''[[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]]'' before producers decided to drop him in favour of former Arsenal teammate [[Ian Wright]].\n\nIn December 2004, following his retirement from professional football, he became one of the celebrities to take part in ''Strictly Ice Dancing'', an ice dance version of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', in which celebrities are paired with professional dancers. He joined the show at late notice, replacing [[Paul Gascoigne]]. With just eight days to prepare for the show, broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 26 December, Seaman and his professional partner Zoia Birmingham managed to win the competition.

He returned to the ice for another ice-dancing series, ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'', broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The series started on 14 January 2006, and Seaman ended in fourth place. He has also appeared on ''All Star [[Family Fortunes]]''.\n\nSeaman also hosts a \"Safe Hands\" charity golf event annually, and has released two football-themed [[DVD]]s entitled ''David Seaman's Goalkeeping Nightmares'' in 2003 and ''Jeepers Keepers'' in 2004. Seaman has also played in all six [[Soccer Aid]] matches for [[England national football team|England]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1131753/|title='Soccer Aid' (TV mini-series 2006)|website==IMDb.com|accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew McNair |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/55285-soccer-aid-2008-a-real-problem-for-football |title=Soccer Aid 2008: A Real Problem For Football |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref><ref>[http://www.unicef.org.uk/press/news_detail_full_story.asp?news_id=1532 ]{{dead link|date=March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 ''The Lobbing of David Seaman'', a poem in [[ballad]] form by [[Murray Lachlan Young]] about Nayim's 1995 goal, was included in the radio programme ''The Loneliness of the Goalkeeper''.<ref>BBC Radio 4, broadcast 25 October 2008</ref> It began with these lines:\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nAh, come all ye teenage goalkeepers\nAnd listen unto me,\nI'll tell you of a goalie\nWho went out to gay Paree;\nThe Gunners called him 'Safe Hands',\nDavid Seaman was his name,\nBut that lonely night in Paris\nWas his world consumed in flames....\n</poem>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn June 2012, Seaman joined [[Combined Counties League]] club [[Wembley F.C.|Wembley]]  as goalkeeping coach for their [[2012\u201313 FA Cup]] campaign, as part of a television documentary following the club's attempt to play at [[Wembley Stadium]].

In a career lasting from 1981 to 2004, he is best known for his time playing for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. He won 75 caps for the [[England national football team]], and is the country's second-most capped goalkeeper, after [[Peter Shilton]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamGkprs/GkprsMstApps.html |title=England's Goalkeepers in Most Appearance Order |work=England Football Online}}</ref> In 1997, he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for services to football.\n\nThe peak of Seaman's career was during his period as Arsenal and England goalkeeper in the 1990s and early 2000s. During his time at Arsenal he won three league championships (1991, 1998, 2002), four [[FA Cup]]s (1993, 1998, 2002, 2003), the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1993 and the [[Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners Cup]] in 1994. During this time he also played for England in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]s, and [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]]. As well as Arsenal, he also played in the [[Premier League]] for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], as well as making appearances in the [[Football League]] for [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], Birmingham City and Queens Park Rangers.\n\nHis save from [[Paul Peschisolido]] of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the [[2002\u201303 FA Cup]] was described as one of the best ever.

He retired in 2004 due to a recurring shoulder injury. In June 2012, he was appointed goalkeeping coach of [[Combined Counties League]] club [[Wembley F.C.|Wembley]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Early career===\nSeaman was born in [[Rotherham]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]<!-- not South Yorkshire, which didn't exist until 11 years after Seaman's birth -->. He attended [[Kimberworth Comprehensive School]].<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article130783.ece ]{{dead link|date=March 2017}}</ref> He began his career at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], the club he supported as a boy. However (much to his disappointment), he was not wanted by then-manager [[Eddie Gray (footballer born 1948)|Eddie Gray]], who had been his favourite player. Seaman went to Division 4 club [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] for a \u00a34,000 fee in August 1982, where he began to make a name for himself.\n\nJust over two years later, in October 1984, [[Football League Championship|Second Division]] [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] paid \u00a3100,000 for Seaman's services. They ended up winning [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] at the end of that season, but were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] again at the end of the following season. Seaman was not to follow them back to Division Two, however.\n\nIn August 1986, Seaman moved to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] for \u00a3225,000. Playing in a higher profile club on a plastic pitch, he earned his first England cap, which came under [[Bobby Robson]] in a friendly against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in November 1988. Whilst at QPR, Seaman was coached by Arsenal double-winner (of 1971) [[Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)|Bob Wilson]], who was to work with him for more than a decade.\n\n=== Arsenal ===\nIn 1990, long before the current [[transfer window]] system had come to English football, there was still a transfer deadline a few weeks before the end of the season. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], who had won the league in 1989, wanted to sign Seaman, but the deal involved Arsenal's keeper [[John Lukic]] heading the opposite way on loan. Lukic did not want to do this, and the deal broke down and remained unresolved when the deadline passed. As soon as the season ended and clubs were allowed to buy players again, Arsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] came back for Seaman, with \u00a31.3 million (at the time a British record for a goalkeeper)<ref>{{cite news |last=Rich |first=Tim |date=13 May 2003 |title=Seaman's standing unfairly undermined by rare mistakes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/seamans-standing-unfairly-undermined-by-rare-mistakes-590470.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> being the agreed fee. Lukic, who was highly popular amongst Arsenal fans, left to rejoin Leeds.\n\nSeaman's time at Arsenal coincided with one of the most successful periods in the club's history. The [[1990\u201391 Arsenal F.C. season|1990\u201391 season]] saw Seaman concede only 18 goals when playing in every match of the 38-game season as Arsenal regained the [[List of English football champions|league title]].\n\nArsenal won both the [[1992\u201393 FA Cup|FA Cup]] and the [[1992\u201393 Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1993 and supplemented this a year later with the [[1993\u201394 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]. Arsenal began their victorious League Cup campaign against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and after two legs the game went to a penalty shootout.

Wenger rated Seaman highly and in [[1997-98 Arsenal F.C. season|1998]], Seaman helped the team to the [[1997-98 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and [[1997-98 FA Cup|FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]]. In [[1998-99 Arsenal F.C. season|1998\u201399]], Seaman played all 38 league matches, conceding only 17 league goals as Arsenal came within one point of retaining the [[1998\u201399 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and lost in the [[1998\u201399 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-finals to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. The following season Seaman managed to reach the [[2000 UEFA Cup Final]], which Arsenal drew 0\u20130 with [[Galatasaray S.K.

A highlight of this season was when Seaman dramatically saved a [[Gareth Barry]] penalty as Arsenal won 2\u20131 at [[Aston Villa]].<ref>{{cite news \n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1873883.stm\n|title=Arsenal see off Villa\n|publisher=BBC   \n|date=17 March 2002 |accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite his international career ending so flatly and accusations his mobility had faded with age, the [[2002\u201303 Arsenal F.C. season|2002\u201303 season]]\u2014Seaman's last at Arsenal\u2014ended on a high note.

However, the goalkeeper leapt sideways and backwards, managing to stretch his right arm behind him and scoop the ball back and away from both his goal and the opposing players ready to pounce on a rebound. The match was Seaman's 1,000th professional career game.

Whilst out of action due to injury, Seaman announced his immediate retirement in January 2004 at the age of 40. His last act at City was to help Keegan select his successor in goal, [[David James (footballer)|David James]] \u2014 the man who had ousted him as England's first choice goalkeeper a little over a year earlier.\n\nIn November 2005, [[Paul Merson]] and [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] approached Seaman, and later ex-[[Wales national football team|Wales]] goalkeeper [[Neville Southall]] and [[Chris Woods]], to play in an [[FA Cup]] game at [[Merthyr Tydfil F.C.|Merthyr Tydfil]] as their two first-choice keepers, [[Joe Murphy (footballer born 1981)|Joe Murphy]] and [[Andy Oakes (footballer)|Andy Oakes]], were unavailable.

He also became the [[spokesman]] for [[Yorkshire Tea]] during the early 1990s. He briefly replaced [[Gary Lineker]] as team captain on the television quiz ''[[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]]'' before producers decided to drop him in favour of former Arsenal teammate [[Ian Wright]].\n\nIn December 2004, following his retirement from professional football, he became one of the celebrities to take part in ''Strictly Ice Dancing'', an ice dance version of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', in which celebrities are paired with professional dancers. He joined the show at late notice, replacing [[Paul Gascoigne]]. With just eight days to prepare for the show, broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 26 December, Seaman and his professional partner Zoia Birmingham managed to win the competition. The other competitors spent a month in training for the show.\n\nIn late 2005 he had his trademark [[ponytail]] cut off on live television for charity, which ended negotiatory talks with such companies as L'Oreal who wanted to sponsor his hair as they had with [[David Ginola]]. He returned to the ice for another ice-dancing series, ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'', broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The series started on 14 January 2006, and Seaman ended in fourth place. He has also appeared on ''All Star [[Family Fortunes]]''.\n\nSeaman also hosts a \"Safe Hands\" charity golf event annually, and has released two football-themed [[DVD]]s entitled ''David Seaman's Goalkeeping Nightmares'' in 2003 and ''Jeepers Keepers'' in 2004.
