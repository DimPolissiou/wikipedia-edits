Estimates indicate that 30% of preschool age children (ages 4 \u20135) do not attend school, and for the most vulnerable populations \u2013 poor, rural, indigenous and afro-descendants - this calculation exceeds 40 percent. Among primary school age children (ages 6 to 12), coverage is almost universal; however there is still a need to incorporate 5 million children in the primary education system. These children live mostly in remote areas, are indigenous or Afro-descendants and live in extreme poverty.<ref name=Survey>BID/EDU Stakeholder Survey 1993/2003, February 8, 2011</ref>\n\nAmong people between the ages of 13 and 17 years, only 80% are enrolled in the education system; among those, only 66% attend secondary school.  The remaining 14% are still attending primary school. These percentages are higher among vulnerable population groups: 75% of the poorest youth between the ages of 13 and 17 years attend school.  Tertiary education has the lowest coverage, with only 70% of people between the ages of 18 and 25 years outside of the education system. Currently, more than half of low income children or people living in rural areas fail to complete nine years of education.<ref name=Survey/>\n\n==Retention and completion==\n[[File:Figure 4 Distribution of youth aged 18 to 24 years, by schooling condition and by educational attainment in each country Youth and changing realities.svg|thumb|Distribution of youth by schooling condition and educational attainment in Latin American countries]]\nIn [[Mexico]], access to education has increased with 87% of the population today completing their primary schooling compared to 46.6% in 1980.<ref>Welti, Carlos. \"Adolescents in Latin America\" ''Facing the Future with Skepticism''</ref> The countries of the region show wide differences in their averages and gaps in completion rates, especially at the secondary level. While on average 55% of youth in the region complete the first cycle of secondary education, in countries such as [[Guatemala]] and [[Nicaragua]] this estimation falls to 30%. In [[Chile]], it approaches 80%. Desertion is also a challenge for [[Latin America]]. According to [[Inter-American Development Bank]] studies, 20% of students enter primary school with one or more lagging years. During this cycle, about 10% repeat 1st and 2nd grade, and 8% repeat grades 3 and 4. Only 40% of children enter secondary school at the expected age. At the secondary level, approximately 10% of youth in each grade level repeat their grade. On average, a child who attends 7.2 years of school completes only 6 years of education (primary), while a person attending 12 years of school only completes 9 years of education (high school).<ref name=Survey/>  By the age of 18, only 1 in every 6 rural men and women are still in school.

This system was put in place in order to improve retention rates and student outcomes. EDUCO is a form of community-managed schools, in which the community is in charge of school administration, including the hiring and firing of teachers and decisions such as how long the students go to school for and for how many days. A study conducted from 1996-1998 found that students in EDUCO schools were 5% more likely to continue their education than those in traditional schools and that weekly visits by the community and parent organizations that run the schools increased probability of school retention by 19%.<ref>Jimenez, Emmanuel, and Yasuyuki Sawada. \"Does Community Management Help Keep \nChildren in Schools?

School infrastructure and access to basic services such as water, electricity, telecommunications and sewage systems are very poor in many [[Latin American]] schools.  Approximately 40% of elementary schools lack libraries, 88% lack science labs, 63% lack a meeting space for teachers, 65% lack computer rooms, and 35% lack a gymnasium. On the other hand, 21% of schools have no access to potable water, 40% lack a drainage system, 53% lack phone lines, 32% have an inadequate number of bathrooms, and 11% have no access to electricity. The conditions of schools that hold students from the poorest quintile are highly unsuitable: approximately 50% have electricity and water, 19% have a drainage system and 4% have access to a telephone line; almost none have science labs, gymnasiums, computer rooms, and only 42% have libraries.<ref>''Inter \u2013 American Development Bank'', Situaci\u00f3n de la Infraestructura Escolar y Calidad de la Educaci\u00f3n B\u00e1sica en Am\u00e9rica Latina Un an\u00e1lisis a partir del SERCE Forthcoming, February 7, 2011</ref> Additionally, students who migrate to cities from rural areas generally live cheaply on the periphery of urban centers where they have little to no access to public services.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=B.

Second Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study (SERCE) data indicate that, on average, 3rd and 6th grade students have access to only three books per student in the school library. Students from lower socioeconomic status have access to an average of one book per student, while students from higher socioeconomic status have access to eight books per student. A school's location is a high determinant of the number of books that a student will have, benefitting urban schools over rural schools.<ref name=\"iadb.org\">[http://www.iadb.org/document.cfm?id=35361923 ''Inter \u2013 American Development Bank'', Los Docentes las Escuelas y los Aprendizajes Escolares en Am\u00e9rica Latina: Un Estudio Regional Usando la Base de Datos del SERCE, February 7, 2011]</ref> With regards to educational technologies, while there has been an increase in [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT) access for [[Latin American]] children and adolescents in the last decade, along with a widespeard interest in One-to-One (1-1) computing models in the past 4 years, its access and use is still too limited to produce sufficient changes in the educational practices of teachers and students. Students in the region are reaching a rate of 100 students per computer, indicating that each student has access to a few minutes of computer time a week.<ref>[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001867/186769S.pdf \"Factores Asociados al Logro Cognitivo de los Estudiantes de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe\"], Segundo Estudio Regional Comparativo y Explicativo, February 7, 2011</ref>\n\nThe majority of [[Latin American]] countries have a shorter school year than [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries: while the school year in [[Japan]] lasts 240 days, it lasts 180 days in [[Argentina]] and only 125 days in [[Honduras]].<ref>[http://www.iadb.org/document.cfm?id=35329103 \"An\u00e1lisis de la Fuerza Laboral en Educaci\u00f3n en Honduras\"], Inter \u2013 American Development Bank, February 7, 2011</ref> Furthermore, the average instruction time in the region is also short: two thirds of students in the region have less than 20 hours of instruction time per week (on average only 10% of [[Latin American]] students at the  primary level attend school full-time). Student and teacher absence rates in the region are also high.\n\n==Learning==\n\nThe results of the Second Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study (SERCE) indicate that almost two-thirds of [[Latin American]] students do not achieve satisfactory reading and math scores. There is a significant learning gap between students from different socio-economic backgrounds, those who live in rural areas and those who belong to indigenous and Afro-descendant groups. Research indicates that student in 3rd grade belonging to the poorest quintile has a 12% probability of obtaining a satisfactory reading score while a student in the wealthiest quintile has a 56% probability of doing so. In mathematics, the probability differs between 10% and 48%.<ref name=\"iadb.org\"/> Data from surveys conducted to employers in Argentina, Brazil and Chile developed by the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) show that a significant proportion of employers face difficulties in finding workers with relevant skills for good job performance, especially behavioral skills.\n\n==PISA==\n\nThe 2009 [[Program for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) results reveal that countries in the region have a low performance and high inequality level compared with other countries. 48% of Latin American students have difficulty performing rudimentary reading tasks and do not have the essential skills needed to participate effectively and productively in society (not achieving level 2), as measured by the 2009 PISA Assessment, compared with only 18% of students in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries. This percentage is even more pronounced for low-income students in the region, where 62% do not demonstrate these essential skills.<ref name=Pisa>[http://www.iadb.org/es/temas/educacion/resultados-pisa-2009,2103.html \"PISA 2009 Results\"], Education Initiative, February 7, 2011</ref>\n\nAccording to the Inter-American Development Bank's (IDB) analysis of the 2009 PISA Results, [[Chile]], [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]] are among the countries that displayed the largest advancements when compared to previous versions of the test. Despite this, countries in the region are ranked among the lowest performing countries. [[Chile]], which achieved the best reading scores at the regional level, is ranked number 44 out of 65 while [[Panama]] and [[Peru]] are located at numbers 62 and 63, respectively. The poor performance of Latin American students is also evident when compared to countries of similar income levels. The gap between the results obtained by the countries in the region and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) (excluding [[Mexico]] and [[Chile]]) is enhanced when taking into account the level of income per capita of the countries in the sample. [[Latin America]] received systematically worse results than what their level of per capita income or expenditure on education would predict.<ref name=Pisa/>\n\n== School bullying ==\n\n=== Central America ===\nAccording to consistent [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] data collected in 2015 in [[Costa Rica]] and Mexico, globally, the Central America sub-region has the lowest prevalence of [[bullying]], at 22.8% (range 19%-31.6%) and there is little difference in bullying prevalence between the sexes.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000366483|title=Behind the numbers: ending school violence and bullying|publisher=UNESCO|year=2019|isbn=978-92-3-100306-6|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[School bullying|Sexual bullying]] is the most frequent type of bullying for both boys (15.3%) and girls (10.8%).

This slow growth has been a puzzle, because education and [[human capital]] is frequently identified as an important element of growth.  Yet, the relatively good performance of Latin America in terms of access and school attainment has not translated into good economic outcomes.  For this reason, many economists have argued that other factors such as economic institutions or financial crises must be responsible for the poor growth, and they have generally ignored any role for education in Latin American countries.<ref>For example, see Sebastion Edwards, Gerardo Esquivel, and Graciela M\u00e1rquez (eds.), ''The decline of Latin American economies: Growth, institutions, and crises'' (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 2007) or Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez-Arias, Rodolfo Manuelli, and Juan S. Blyde (eds.). ''Sources of growth in Latin America: What is missing?'' (Washington, DC: Inter-American Development Bank, 2005).</ref>  On the other hand, [[Eric Hanushek]] and [[Ludger Woessmann]] argue that the slow growth is directly related to the low achievement and poor learning that comes with each year of school in Latin America.<ref>[[Eric A.

The first phase of secondary education \u2013 or lower secondary according to UNESCO's [[International Standard Classification of Education]] (ISCED) \u2013 is compulsory in all Latin Amerian countries except in [[Nicaragua]], while the final phase of secondary education (i.e. upper secondary) is compulsory in 12 of the 19 Latin American countries.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247577E.pdf|title=Youth and changing realities: Rethinking secondary education in Latin America|last=L\u00f3pez|first=N\u00e9stor|last2=Opertti|first2=Renato|last3=Vargas Tamez|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-31 00204-5|location=|pages=15, 18}}</ref>\n\nAt present, it is expethat all individuals gain access to and remain within the education system at least until completion of the secondary level. However, during the first years of the 2010s, there was a schooling deficit \u2013 understood as the gap observed between the theoretical and the actual school trajectory \u2013 corresponding to 2.5% among children aged 9 to 11 years; 21% among [[adolescents]] aged 15 to 17 years; 37% among youth aged 21 to 23 years; and around 46% among [[adults]] aged 31 to 33 years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIndeed, data show that 2.5% of boys and girls aged 9 to 11 years never entered the primary level or, in any case, do not attend school, with no considerable [[Gender Differences|gender differences]]. In rural areas, this proportion is even higher. Yet, the biggest divide is associated with [[socio-economic]] levels, where the lack of schooling impacts the most [[underprivileged]] sectors hardest. The situation is most critical in Nicaragua, where this proportion rises to 8% and in [[Guatemala]] and [[Honduras]], where more than 4% of the boys and girls are out of school.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Higher education==\n\n===Overview===\n\nHigher Education in Latin America has grown over the past forty years to comprise more than 3,000 higher education institutions.<ref name=\"Impact of the Bologna process\">Tiana Ferrer, A.

Rotterdam: Sense Publishers.</ref> The fact that these three countries make up over half of the higher education student population in Latin America brings to light issues and further serves to illuminate on the current system of higher education and its lack of [[Equity (economics)|equity]] in opportunity. Although higher education is not new to the region; indeed, many institutions date back hundreds of years, but the noticeable growth spurt in the area of higher education has been more recent.\n\nThe past four decades have been a time of tremendous change and growth for Higher Education in the region. For example, institutional growth has resulted in a diversification of degrees offered to include more graduate degrees (Master's degrees, professional degrees and doctorates) and less traditional areas of study.<ref name=\"Tiana Ferrer 2014 pp. 125-136\"/> This increase in graduate degrees has presented challenges related to funding, especially in the public sector of education. Budgetary limitations in the late 20th century saw a surge of private universities in many Latin American countries.<ref name=\"Tiana Ferrer 2014 pp. 125-136\"/> These universities sprung up all over the region during the time period and continue to serve a particular subset of the population.  In general, Latin America is still subject to a developmental lag when it comes to education, and higher education in particular. The country of [[Brazil]] is the main exception to this \"developmental lag\".<ref name=\"Tiana Ferrer 2014 pp. 125-136\"/> Brazil boasts many of the top universities in Latin America, in some of the country's richest areas. That being said, no region or university is perfect.  One continuing problem is the persisting issue of how low amounts of money are invested into research and development in the region.<ref name=\"Tiana Ferrer 2014 pp. 125-136\"/>  This creates a lack of competition with other areas of the world and results in less innovation coming from the region. By investing comparatively low amounts of money into research and development, one can surmise that scholars and other scientists will be pulled to other regions of the world.\n\nIn addition, there is a need for regional accreditation programs valid beyond national borders.<ref name=\"Tiana Ferrer 2014 pp. 125-136\"/> An increase in accreditation programs could result in greater transfer of knowledge across universities and borders, be an incentive for more students to study in Latin American universities, and create greater cohesiveness in the region.\n\n===History===\n\n[[European colonization of the Americas|Colonization]] was of great significance to the course of higher education in Latin America, and the spirit of the colonial period was interwoven in the Church. \"In the 1800's, numerous countries, including Chile, Ecuador, and Colombia, signed contracts with the Catholic Church, or modeled their constitution on Catholic values, declaring themselves Catholic states.\"<ref>Eulich, W.

[http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&artid=304 ''Spirit and letters of the Spanish colonial period''].</ref> Entitlement and access to education continued to be an issue throughout the history of higher education in Latin America. From a global perspective on the inception of the university, the oldest existing, and continually operating educational institution in the world is the [[University of Karueein]], founded in 859 AD in Morocco, the [[University of Bologna]], Italy, was founded in 1088, and England's [[University of Oxford]] was founded in 1167.<ref>http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-university</ref>\n\nInitially, the Church and State in Latin America granted authority to universities, and the position of ''maestrescuela'' was filled by one who served as a liaison among stakeholders. \"Most of the universities were organized by religious orders, especially [[Jesuits]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], and these orders provided not only most of the administrators but also most of the teachers\u2026Graduation was a religious as well as an academic event\"; many students were trained to enter the clergy or to take on bureaucratic positions for the state.<ref name=\"Levy, D.C. (1986).\"/>\n\nAt the time of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]], approximately twenty-five universities were operating in Spanish America. These universities, influenced by the  [[French Enlightenment]], came to be regulated by government rather than cooperative interests or the Church.  Growth and expansion of the university system was slowed due to political and financial instability; university life was regularly interrupted. In the 1840s Chile and Uruguay implemented an educational model that incorporated centralized Napoleonic lines which promoted the \"base education for the future leaders of the nation, as well as members of the bureaucracy and the military\".<ref>Markham, J.D.

Ultimately, control over university leadership, faculty, curriculum, and admissions led to the separation of state controlled and funded institutions from those which were privately run.<ref>http://www.iie.org/~/media/Files/Corporate/Publications/INTRO-Latin-Americas-New-Knowledge-Economy.ashx?la=en.</ref> \"Social demand, however, was not the only cause of the proliferation of universities.

The most visible confrontations took place in the late 1960's, a time of student mobilization worldwide. These protests were very frequent throughout the period in most countries in Latin America, reinforcing the image of a politically involved student movement, even if it was often fostered by the mobilization of a minority of student activists with representation in university governance and closely linked to national political movements and parties. In many cases, student confrontations with the authorities mixed radical demands for revolutionary change with more limited demands for organizational transformation and more generous funding\".<ref name=\"webcache.googleusercontent.com\"/> Argentina, for example, had an increasingly robust middle class population which demanded access to university education. Argentina's university system quickly expanded with the demand. \"Contemporary analysts have estimated that roughly 85 to 90 percent of Latin America's university students come from the middle class\".<ref name=\"Levy, D.C. (1986).\"/> That growth and prosperity of Argentina's middle class along with electoral rights, an increased migration to urban areas, and the universal suffrage law of 1912 empowered students to challenge conservative systems and voice their demands. In December 1917, the [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba|University of C\u00f3rdoba]] refused to concede to student demands for the university meet a perceived need. Students responded by organizing a mass protest; they refused to attend classes and hosted a demonstration on school grounds. They magnified the power of the student voice by including local politicians, labor groups, and student organizations. The primary goals of the student movement were to \"secularize and democratize C\u00f3rdoba University by expanding student and professor participation in its administration and modernizing the curricula\", and to make university education \"available and affordable by lifting entrance restrictions and establishing greater flexibility in attendance and examinations to accommodate low and middle-income students with work obligations\".

A slowly changing system, students were met with a number of setbacks. \"Some reforms... reduced student and professorial authority, giving it instead to administrators or even to the State\".<ref name=\"Levy, D.C.

Latin America is facing many issues in the ever-expanding era of globalization. Their enrollments and their students must be prepared to participate in a more globalized world than ever before and they must have the institutions to support a more international mission. Scholars believe that there is tension among countries that defined modernity differently. Modernity within education will allow for progress with educational policy and research and particularly in [[comparative education]]. Defining [[modernity]] differently in each country does not allow for consensus on what a modern educational system could and should look like.<ref>Acosta, F., & Perez Centeno, C.G.

More research must be done in this area to bolster the information on some of the smaller countries in parts of Latin America that do not have higher education options. Or who do have higher education options but are limited in number and scope. In a 2002 publication on higher education institutions in Latin American and Caribbean Universities, including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Uruguay, Venezuela, Mexico, Peru, Brazil and the Dominican Republic, 1,917 of them were considered private universities.<ref name=\"Wit, H. 2005\"/> In some countries, such as Brazil, there are state and federal higher education institutions in each state.  Federal universities in Brazil make up an enrollment of 600,000 student in 99 institutions throughout the country.<ref>Schwartzman, S. (2012).

There are about 5,816 institutes that are considered private or public and even some were not deemed identifiable. Of both regions, Latin America and the Caribbean, there are nearly 14 million students enrolled in some type of higher education institution. Roughly 13,896,522 students are enrolled at institutions in Latin American where not quite 95,000 are enrolled in the Caribbean.<ref>UNESCO. (2005).World Report.</ref> Participation in higher education has seen an increase in enrollment from 1998 to 2001. In developed countries, the gross enrollment rate jumped from 45.6% to 54.6% in 2001.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Iberoamerican Network of Science and Technology (RICYT), Buenos Aires, 2002</ref> Additionally, female participation in enrollment jumped from 59.2% in 1998 to 64.3% in 2001. (unEsCo, 2005). Transitional and developing countries also saw a jump in gross enrollment rates from 1998 to 2001. Of the Latin American countries analyzed, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina had the highest distribution of enrollments. These top three countries accounted for about 60% of total enrollment in higher education.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Brazil led the Latin American countries by holding 28% of higher education enrollment in all of Latin America. Shortly behind Brazil is Mexico with 17% of the total enrollment and Argentina at 14%.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nSets of countries also distribute their enrollment among private and public universities differently as well. For example, Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic students are mostly enrolled in private sector higher education universities and institutions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Between 50% and 75% of total enrollments in the previously mentioned countries are within the private sector. Conversely, Ecuador, Mexico, Venezuela, Paraguay, Peru and Guatemala see between 50% and 75% of their enrollments within the public sector. Cuba, Uruguay, Bolivia, Panama, Honduras and Argentina see the vast majority of their total enrollment within the public sector as well. These countries see about 75% to 100% of their total enrollment attend public institutions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> There has been a clear trend in higher education in Latin America towards the commercialization and privatization of higher education.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This is a trend that is evident throughout the world when it comes to higher education. An increase in private schools meaning more private money which introduces more flexibility when it comes to funding programs and beginning innovation initiatives. Since 1994, enrollment in private institutions has increased nearly 8% to 46% (from 38%) of total enrollment in 2002. Public institutions have seen a decline, however, losing that 8% in total enrollments. Public institutions are down to 54% in 2002.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the Inter-American Development bank altered its focus to the introduction of community colleges and other short-cycle colleges in the region. Then, its lending programs for more traditional higher education declined.<ref name=\"Wit, H. 2005\"/> During this time, the World Bank became a major player in making large investments in several countries. The countries where the largest investments were made were Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela.<ref name=\"Wit, H. 2005\"/> The World Bank has also increased its funding efforts in Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Venezuela in the areas of science and technology research. The efforts by the [[World Bank]] are intended to support the modernization of higher education in major countries throughout Latin America. The funding was used for student aid, university grants, research grants and much more. The granting amounted to more than $1.5 billion since its initiative started.<ref name=\"Wit, H. 2005\"/>\n\nAreas of study vary widely amongst institutions in Latin America. The majority of students\u2019 fields of study are in social sciences, business and law. 42% of enrolled students are studying in social sciences, business and law. Whereas 14% are focusing on engineering, industry and construction. Just 10% are pursuing degrees in Education followed by sciences and health and social welfare each of which are at 9%.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Since the 1980s and into the 1990s, there have been many attempts to reform education in Latin American in direct response to the increased interested in globalization. Although globalization has significantly affected Latin American countries, Latin America as a whole remains out the outskirts of the global research and knowledge centers.<ref name=\"Wit, H. 2005\"/>\n\nOne of the more recent efforts established by a Latin American country to increase globalization and an interest in the [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]] (Science Technology Engineering and Math) fields is the Brazil Scientific Mobility Program. The initiative focuses on sending Brazilian undergraduate and graduate students to study in the United States for a limited period of time.<ref name=\"iie.org\">http://www.iie.org/Programs/Brazil-Scientific-Mobility/About</ref> Students must be majoring in a Brazilian institution in a STEM field in order to participate in the program.

The initiative hopes to grant scholarships to Brazil's 100,000 best students in STEM fields.<ref name=\"iie.org\"/> The Brazilian Scientific Mobility Program also allows Brazilian students to master the English language by offering them time to take intensive English language courses before moving onto STEM content classes.

The primary area of study for Brazilian scholarship grantees is engineering where 65% of program grantees are engineering majors.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The program goals complement the goals and areas of improvement from all of Latin America. The goals are to: \"To promote scientific research; To invest in educational resources, allocated both within Brazil, and internationally; To increase international cooperation within science and technology and To initiate and engage students in global dialogue.<ref name=\"iie.org\"/>\n\nIn order for Latin American countries to bolster their higher education efforts, they must work to massify their higher education system and make their scientific and technological capability more robust.<ref name=\"United Nations Educational 2014\">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. (2014). Regional Report about Education for All in Latin American and the Caribbean: Global Education for All meeting, Muscat, Oman, May 12th and 14th of 2014.</ref> Additionally, more outreach must be obtained amongst nearby societies and countries in order to build rapport and relationships that extend to higher education.  This could improve teacher training, collaboration in curriculum development and support schools in difficult student and teacher interactions. Finally, Latin America must be able to compete with the increased demands that globalization places upon higher education. Latin America must adapt their higher education institutions to reflect the globalization trend affecting higher education throughout the entire world.<ref name=\"United Nations Educational 2014\"/> The trend is already affecting higher education in Latin American countries with initiatives such as the Brazilian Scientific Mobility Program but those programs are few. Providing more opportunities for Latin American students to study abroad even to other Latin American countries could really benefits students to change their worldviews. Eventually, such programs could affect education policy in many Latin American countries providing a strong partnership across the world.\n\nTo learn more about education systems specific to a particular Latin American country, find their webpages here: [[Education in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Education in Bolivia|Bolivia]], [[Education in Chile|Chile]], [[Education in Colombia|Colombia]], [[Education in Ecuador|Ecuador]], [[Education in Venezuela|Venezuela]], [[Education in Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Education in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Education in Panama|Panama]], [[Education in the Bahamas|Bahamas]], [[Education in the Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic]], [[Education in Haiti|Haiti]], etc.\n\n===Higher education funding===\nLatin American countries have developed a strong economic growth during the 2000s- the first time since the [[Latin American debt crisis|debt crisis]] of the 1980s. In addition, with a \"demographic bonus\", in which the proportion of children declines and thus the older generation has increased the size of the [[working-age]] population. Thus, for aging societies, it is essential to invest in advanced human capital for the quality and productivity of a smaller work force. So, the expanding regional growth increases the financial resources to train more and better-qualified higher education graduates.<ref>De Fanelli, A.G. (2014). Financing Higher Education in Latin America. International Higher Education. (Vol. 74, pp. 22-24).</ref>\nIn Latin American countries, nearly half of enrollment in [[tertiary education]] is concentrated in institutions whose main source of funding is tuition and fees. Therefore, students and their parents are already contributing heavily to finance higher education institutions. Moreover, some of these countries charge tuition and fees to students at public universities; a prime example is Chile's public university sector.  In other countries where undergraduate programs in public institutions are free of charge and the majority of the enrollment is concentrated in the public sector (as in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]), the government is the principal source of funding. However, this is not the case with [[graduate degrees]] as students usually pay the tuition and fees at [[graduate schools]].\n\nIn most Latin American countries, with the exception of [[Chile]], negotiating the funding model is still the most relevant mechanism to distribute core higher education funding to institutions.<ref name=\"Gazzola, A.L. 2008\">Gazzola, A.L., & Didriksson, A. (2008). Trends in Higher Education in Latin American and the Caribbean. Bogota, Colombia: Panamerican Formas e Impresos, S.A.</ref> Additionally, since the late 1980s and 1990s, many of these governments have been allocating a small proportion of the total budget via formulas and funds to achieve specific objectives. Several Latin American countries took advantage of the boom years and raised their public and private investment in higher education. This also contributed to improving low-income students\u2019 access to these institutions.\n\nThe complexity of Higher Education in the region can be viewed in a series of historical and emerging trends, in its [[heterogeneity]], its inequality, but above all in the role that public universities and some very outstanding institutions of higher education can assume in order to construct a new scenario that can aid in significant improvement in the living conditions of its populations, and provide the possibility of greater well-being, democracy, and equality coming from science, education, and culture. The rest of this section will take a look at how Higher Education institutions in Latin America are funded. Changes have been occurring and the funding models appear to be moving targets.\n\nLatin America is diverse with twenty sovereign states that stretch from the southern border of the [[United States]] to the southern tip of [[South America]]. With this much space and diversity, the funding for higher education can vary from state to state.\n\nThere seem to be four prevalent models for the financing of higher education in Latin America. These four models apply indiscriminately and in different combinations in the countries of the region, thus reflecting the diversity one observes in the region in terms of financing and policies and outcomes.<ref name=\"Gazzola, A.L. 2008\"/> The four prevalent models for financing Higher Education in Latin America are:\n\n# Direct public financing, provided to eligible institutions through the regular state budget, usually through legislative approval and through the respective ministry responsible for financial matters. The receiving institutions are state universities; this is, formal dependencies of state authority, which academics contracted through the public service, and with the application of management norms being those that are applicable to the public sector in general. Exceptions to this are the cases of [[Chile]] and [[Nicaragua]], where for historical reasons, private institutions also receive this kind of public financing. In many states various conditions have been established for the use of the funds, thus restricting the autonomy of their institutional management. Some countries have attempted to make this fixed-base form of providing resources to Higher Education more flexible through budgetary review based on academic results.<ref name=\"Gazzola, A.L. 2008\"/> \n# Policy objective-based public financing. This treats resources that are usually not recurrent, included in special funds of a transitory nature or for attaining specific objectives or achievements of universities or institutions of Higher Education that those funds help to finance. Many of the objectives or goals established have to do with teaching, especially taking into account the numbers and quality of students (the case of the Indirect Fiscal Contribution in [[Chile]]), or with achievements in the area of research (funds in the case of [[Venezuela]]), or for graduate training (The CAPES model of [[Brazil]]). Less progress has been made in terms of programs that include negotiations with the state and competition between institutions in order to obtain funds based on management commitments.  The Chilean experience regarding MECESUP (improvement of quality and equity in Higher Education) funds fostered this purpose, but the results in terms of sustainable achievements are still to be seen. In Argentina, the case of FOMEC (implemented competitive funds) is alike, with resources aimed at real investment programs. It is important to mention Brazil in this regard. The Ministry of Education established a program called PROUNI in 2005 with the purpose of optimizing the use of enrolment places offered by private universities.  In effect, the excess of unused enrolment places, which tends to diminish efficiency in the provision of private education leads to an offer by the public sector to acquire them at a tuition cost below that originally charged. In this regard, the incentive for universities to fill their places and foster a greater absorption of students in the Higher Education system, giving preference for grants to student with the greatest financial need. In the short term, the government seeks to have some 400,000 students participating in this system, a figure that in 2006 was 250,000 students.<ref name=\"Gazzola, A.L. 2008\"/> \n# Private financing occurs through the payment of tuition on the part of families, by companies that finance research and graduate programs, or thorough private individuals or companies that make donations to institutions of Higher Education. The charging of student tuition is not only a practice carried out by multiple new universities that have emerged throughout the region. Charging for the cost of education has also been transformed into a practice that increasingly occurs in state universities as well- a situation that [[Chile]] is notorious for. Tuition charges and the ways in which this takes place is a controversial political theme in most countries, since it tends to reserve Higher Education for an elite, and has a negative long-term impact on the distribution of income. However, it is clear without greater financial commitment from states, further expansion of Higher Education can only be attained, once existing residual resources of the institutions have been used, only through a reduction of quality.  This has placed in relief the emergence of [[accreditation]] institutions and procedures aimed being used as an instrument of control or at least of information, regarding private expansion and the progressive privatization of the state sector. In regard to the existence of private donations as a financing mechanism for Higher Education, the regulatory structure for doing so is extremely fragile in most Latin American countries.  There is also a culture of distrust toward the public sector and academia in general terms, which also affects the possibility of establishing private company-university strategic alliances for financing and execution of projects with productive applications.  From the university side, there is an [[anti-capitalist]] sentiment that sees the desire for profit as a negative influence on scientific and technological research.<ref name=\"Gazzola, A.L. 2008\"/>\n# A mixed model, that combines state financing, both fixed and by objectives and goals, with private financing based on the direct payment from students or through other mechanisms or private funding. The Chilean case is one of these (in which the state university sector collects monthly charges).  The Mexico system is trying to grow the public resources allocated by objectives and goals.  In [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Peru]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], countries for which information exists, between 10% ([[Costa Rica]]) and 38% ([[Peru]]) of the incomes of institutions of Higher Education come from their own resources generated by private activities.<ref name=\"Gazzola, A.L. 2008\"/>\nTuition charges have progressively become a reality in institutions of Higher Education in Latin America. Public and state universities face serious structural financial problems, especially because their resources embrace teaching, research, and extension, including the production of public goods that do not necessarily have an explicit financial counterpart. These universities also obey a number of public regulation which often raise their costs significantly. Financial restrictions oblige them to cover at least part of their costs based on student fees.  This has led to profound and sustained conflicts. The conversations around funding Higher Education in Latin America are ongoing.\n\nOverall, Latin American countries have made great progress in improving their education systems, particular in the last two decades. The governments have increased spending on education, expanded cooperation with the [[United States]], the [[World Bank]], and other donors, and pledged to achieve certain educational milestones established through the Organization of American States' Summit of the Americas process.  However, despite these recent improvements, Latin America's education indicators still lag behind the [[developed world]] and many [[developing countries]] of comparable income levels in [[East Asia]].<ref>Seelke, C.R. (2007). [http://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RS22778.pdf \"Overview of Education Issues and Programs in Latin America\"].</ref>\n\n=== Student opportunities and future challenges ===\n{{Essay-like|section|date=August 2015}}\n\nOne major problem facing students in higher education in Latin America is that of [[educational equity]]. This issue includes economic equality, disparity amongst [[socioeconomic]] classes and therefore access to higher education. As mentioned above, a majority of higher education students within Latin America come from the middle class. But one must look at what this actually means:  Latin America currently showcases the lowest rates of income distribution (across society), especially when compared to other parts of the [[industrialized world]]. In addition, levels of social injustice are extremely high if one takes into account distribution of income as a central element to the concept of social justice. A massive gap exists when it comes to income distribution in many Latin American countries.  Despite progress and development, the pervasive poverty is exacerbated by the \"concentration of wealth in some groups, together with low labor  participation (unemployment and underemployment) in many countries [which] represents one of the unmet challenges for the region\".<ref name=Trends>''Trends in Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean''. Ana L\u00facia Gazzola & Axel Didriksson, Editors</ref> This \"unmet challenge\" will, until addressed, result in increased inequality and access to higher education. And even though the region is growing economically and in population, this is not enough.  Further, \"In the face of the challenge of inequality, it is not enough to grow economically at a higher rate. It is necessary to grow toward greater social equity. This inequality, one of the most serious in the world, will tend to continue and to worsen if we do not change the current focuses of many government policies\".<ref name=Trends/>\n\nOrganizations which link higher education between Latin America and Europe include Al\u00dfAN (now ERASMUS Mundos), ALFA and AlInvest. The ALFA Program of co-operation between Higher Education Institutions (HEI's) of the European Union and Latin America \"began in 1994 and sought to reinforce co-operation in the field of Higher Education. The program co-finances projects aimed at improving the capacity of individuals and institutions (universities and other relevant organizations) in the two regions\".<ref>http://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/peru/eu_peru/tech_financial_cooperation/regional_cooperation_la/index_en.htm Accessed August 5, 2015</ref> Al\u00dfAN provided scholarships to Latin American students, but was replaced in 2010 by ERASMUS Mundos, which provides avenues for Latin American students to study in Europe. ERASMUS Mundos also fosters community and cooperation between Latin America and the European Union. The program provides joint masters and doctoral programs, including a scholarship scheme. It has the aim of \"mobility flows of students and academics between European and non-European higher education institutions [and the] promotion of excellence and attractiveness of European higher education worldwide...The European Commission informs potential applicants about funding opportunities through a program guide and regular calls for proposals published on the Erasmus Mundus website\".<ref>http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/peru/travel_eu/study_eu/index_en.htm Accessed August 5, 2015</ref>\n\nOrganizations exist to foster cooperation between Latin American and North American higher education, as well. The Ibero-American University Council (CUIB) and the Latin American Network for the Accreditation and Quality of Higher Education are two such organizations. \"Latin American and North American cooperation is often labeled inter-American and is exemplified by organizations such as the Inter-American Organization for Higher Education (IOHE) and the Organization of American States (OAS )\".<ref name=\"siteresources.worldbank.org\">http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTLACREGTOPEDUCATION/Resources/Higher_Ed_in_LAC_Intnal_Dimension.pdf Accessed August 5, 2015</ref> According to the World Bank, the Latin American region is \"defined in a cultural and geographical sense. It includes all the countries from Mexico to Argentina. Organizations such as the Latin American Universities Union and the Institute for Higher Education in Latin America and Caribbean are good examples of regional organizations. Sub-regional organizations include the Montevideo Group University Association (AUGM), the Association of Universities of the Amazon (UNAMAZ), and the Council of University Presidents for the Integration of the West-Central Sub-Region of South America (CRISCO)\".<ref name=\"siteresources.worldbank.org\"/>\n\nAccording to ''The Economist'', \"Latin America boasts some giant universities and a few venerable ones: the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) enroll several hundred thousand students apiece, while Lima's San Marcos was founded in 1551. Even so, the region is hardly synonymous with excellence in higher education. Research output is unimpressive, teaching techniques are old-fashioned and students drop out in droves. These failings matter. Faster economic growth is driving a big rise in demand for higher education in the region and a large crop of new universities\".<ref name=Economist>[http://www.economist.com/node/21531468#cwvrGyfPV42lT7YT.99 ''The Economist''], 8 October 2011.

The [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo]] (USP), the richest and biggest university in Brazil's richest state, came top\".<ref name=Economist/>\n\n== Gender Gap ==\nIn the midst of an educational crisis in Latin America, there is a gender gap present within the schooling system. Various regions in Latin American countries are affected differently by the gap due to inter-sectional factors, such as economic state and societal beliefs. Generally, higher dropout rates plague rural regions, where children are pressured to work, opposed to suburban regions.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001310/131040e.pdf|title=Gender Equality in Basic Education in Latin America and the Caribbean|date=March 2002}}</ref> Generally, rural areas lack the relative amount of resources that urban areas have, and families living in these areas experience poverty at greater frequencies.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iadb.org/res/publications/pubfiles/pubwp-600.pdf|title=The Educational Gender Gap in Latin America and the Caribbean|last=Duryea|first=Suzanne|last2=Galiani|first2=Sebastian|date=April 2007|publisher=Research Department of the Inter-American Development Bank|last3=Nopo|first3=Hugo|last4=Piras|first4=Claudia}}</ref> Their economic disadvantage leads these families to send their male children to school, rather than female children, when they are given the option. This decision has resulted in lower enrollment rates in school for female children.<ref name=\":03\" /> The gap in enrollment is present starting from basic education, which has been defined in literature as the stage of education that encompasses childhood education, primary school, and early stages of secondary school.<ref name=\":03\" /> Research suggests greater prevalence of gender differences in higher education. Generally, early education is free and higher education requires tuition costs. Consequently, enrollment rates are more dependent on income levels instead of gender. Even among the wealthiest group of individuals, females are less likely to participate in higher education than males.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nIn previous decades, females achieved lower levels and less years of education compared to males, even in more economically developed countries. However, as time progressed, the gender gap began to shrink at a rate of approximately 0.27 years of schooling per decade.<ref name=\":12\" /> From the 1960s, the gap began to shift towards the favor of females; females are attending more years of school and differences in enrollment rates between the sexes are diminishing.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nSocietal expectations of boys and girls in these countries have a major influence on these dropout rates. The gender roles created by society often vary across cultures, as do the expectations of the type of responsibilities that female and male children will take on in the household. Boys are expected to provide for the household under domestic economic strain. Despite having a higher enrollment rate, male children experience higher dropout rates and attain lower levels of education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.iadb.org/bitstream/handle/11319/4735/Social%20Exclusion%20in%20Education%20in%20Latin%20America%20and%20the%20Caribbean.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|title=Social Exclusion in Education in Latin America and the Caribbean|last=Marshall|first=Jeffery H.|last2=Calderon|first2=Valentina|date=February 2006}}</ref> Similarly, female children in rural regions experience higher dropout rates after domestic emergencies, in order to care for the family and household.<ref name=\":03\" /> However, when granted the opportunity, females contribute to higher promotion rates and are less likely to repeat years of schooling.<ref name=\":12\" /> Differences due to societal expectations still exist in more economically advantaged Latin American countries and regions, but at lower rates and with more equality between the sexes.\n\n=== Migration ===\nThe gender gap in education also contributes to the unique experience of migrants from Latin America. If young adults and children anticipate that they will be migrating, then they are less likely to attend to school in their native country, and less likely to value its importance. A common belief, cited as a reason for this phenomenon, is that they feel education will not make a difference when they are working overseas.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|last=Bejarano|first=Christina E.|last2=Manzano|first2=Sylvia|last3=Montoya|first3=Celeste|date=2011|title=Tracking the Latino Gender Gap: Gender Attitudes across Sex, Borders and Generations|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1426ebf4add7ca93294200b602aeee5133884ee8|journal=Politics and Gender|volume=7|issue=4|pages=521\u2013549|doi=10.1017/S1743923X11000341}}</ref> Contrarily, individuals who have access to education, and obtain an education in their native country, view the importance of education upon migration differently. These individuals believe that education will bring about more opportunities for them upon migration.<ref name=\":22\" /> Whether or not one views education as a beneficial factor to their migration is likely due to their cultural norms, which encourage different roles for boys and girls. Women are expected to take care of their parents, and for those who assume this cycle continues when they have children, their desire to attend school diminishes.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=Pessar|first=Patricia R.|last2=Mahler|first2=Sarah J.|date=Fall 2003|title=Transnational Migration: Bringing Gender In|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx7dFWXNGLJFaFlkM1NBaDNCTE0/view|journal=The International Migration Review|volume=37 |issue=3|pages=812\u2013846|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7379.2003.tb00159.x}}</ref> First generation immigrant women are most influenced by the more liberal social norms in the United States; they are presented with higher availability of education and employment.

Typically, women working these jobs did not receive an education in their native country.<ref name=\":22\" /> Men are also influenced by the opportunities that women have in the country, as they are used to being granted the educational and employment opportunities back home. Upon migration to the United States, men long to go back to their native country earlier than women. Gender roles create a sense of power among men, and being presented with liberal gender roles for women often takes away the sense of power they may have felt back home.<ref name=\":32\" /> Factors such as income, cultural beliefs, and region influence how one experiences the gender differences that accompany education and migration.<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\n\n== Educational Labor Unions in Latin America ==\n\n'''Effects of Labor Union on Latin American education'''\n\nGiven the increased trend of children enrolling into schools, the resources of Latin American educational systems have become increasingly strained with poor students who require additional public resources for success.,<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001310/131040e.pdf|title=Gender Equality in Basic Education in Latin America and the Caribbean|date=March 2002}}</ref><ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iadb.org/res/publications/pubfiles/pubwp-600.pdf|title=The Educational Gender Gap in Latin America and the Caribbean|last=Duryea|first=Suzanne|last2=Galiani|first2=Sebastian|date=April 2007|publisher=Research Department of the Inter-American Development Bank|last3=Nopo|first3=Hugo|last4=Piras|first4=Claudia}}</ref>  On recent tests of mathematics and science, around half of Latin American students scored below the lowest proficiency levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.focal.ca/es/publications/focalpoint/258-june-2010-tamara-ortega-goodspeed|title=Latin America's education challenges call for concrete action|last=Mestechkin|first=Ruth|website=focal.ca|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref> These problems are combatted through the formation of teachers labor unions.\n\n'''Effects of Labor Unions'''\n\nFrom 1989 to 1997, the number of countries with national testing systems has increased 2 to 21. These reforms have continued throughout the 2000s, several countries starting in 2006 have set national standards including Nicaragua, Colombia, and Argentina. The changing policies have brought teachers\u2019 union under the light as important policy actors. Studies conducted by Murillo on labor unions in Peru have shown that labor unions have improved student achievement overall by retaining experienced teachers and lowering class sizes; although strikes, a key means by which unions exert power over policy,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unionplus.org/page/how-do-unions-work|title=How do Unions Work?|website=Union|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref> negatively impacts students affected by them. It was found that school days that were lost to strikes consequently lowered the exam scores of the students. It was also found that tenure, a common demand of teachers' unions, has increased student achievement in classes, even despite increased days of teacher absence because of the job security which these teachers felt. There has also been evidence that formation of unions has allowed in a decrease of classroom sizes. On average there is one less student per every teacher which allows for teachers to spend more time with an individual student.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|title=Teacher Unionization and the Quality of Education in Peru: an Empirical Evaluation using Survey Data|last=Zegarra|first=Eduardo|date=2002|citeseerx = 10.1.1.581.2035}}</ref>\n\n'''Professionalization of Teachers in Unions'''\n\nSpecifically in Argentina the union has played an important role in the formation of accredited professional development courses. In 1994 CTERA signed an agreement with UNC and started a series of teacher training programs. In 2000, two graduate tracks were developed and more than 1600 teachers were trained. Teachers who are actively involved in the union develop a sense of professionalism through the experience of organizing. Because teachers\u2019 union activity centers on particular education  projects formed by the union itself, involvement in the formation of education goals and initiatives shapes teachers\u2019 sense of their worth as practitioners. Therefore, participation in the union allows teachers to deepen their knowledge, commitment and practice. In Brazil, from 1998-2002 the union published their enrolled members final assignments for the class. Peruvian education is characterized by high coverage and extremely low expenditures per student. Specific programs such as MECEP has increased inputs and training for teachers hoping to enhance education system.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gindin|first=Juli\u00e1n|date=2013|title=Promoting Education Quality: the Role of Teachers' Unions in Latin America|url=|journal=Education for All Global Monitoring Report 2013/4|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n'''Addition of Incentives'''\n\nIn countries like Brazil and Chile \u201cincentive schemes\u201d were initiated. An incentive scheme is a policy which financially awards the teachers. However resistance has been noticed depending on the type of the incentive. Teachers from many Latin American countries have opposed incentives based on the evaluations of teachers themselves (Ecuador, Peru, Chile and partially Mexico) or of student's test scores (Ecuador, Peru, Chile and partially Mexico). The addition of incentives can lead to both positive and negative impacts. Some of the positive factors will include a teacher's dedication towards their work to improve the overall level of education of all students. These methods also help filter out teachers who are not the best teachers. If a teacher's performance is not meeting the set standards then it is a sign that something is wrong and a change is required. If incentives involve rewards then high scores among a few students can boost  the overall average. In such cases  a teacher might focus the bulk of their attention towards the brighter students and neglecting the other kids.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''Bolivia'''\n\nEducation in rural areas  of Bolivia have been a problem because people in these areas belong to poor farming families. These areas consist people of indigenous people and who don't have a lot money therefore are unable to afford an education. An organization known as the CONMERB started a teaching proposal in 1983 known as the \u201cGlobal plan for the restructuring of rural education in Bolivia\u201d. This plan called for bilingual and bicultural education and was promoted at union events. This program took a progressive turn when President Morales decreased the National Literacy Program for the republic of Bolivia in April 2006. At that point 13.7% of Bolivian population was considered illiterate but by 2009, Bolivia had declared itself as an illiteracy free zone and was subsequently congratulated by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''Peru'''\n\nIn Peru, the government of Alan Garc\u00eda (2005-2011) promulgated a reform of the Teachers\u2019 Statute without negotiating with the Trade Union of Education Workers of Peru (SUTEP). The reform was proposed along with a series of other anti-union measures (for example, the government reduced the number of union leaders who could be exempted from their teaching duties to concentrate on union tasks). Public Educator Law No. 29,062 was enacted in 2007 amid an indefinite SUTEP strike explicitly against this bill. One of the biggest points of contention was the proposed evaluation of teacher performance. In the law's current form, the Committee for Evaluation of Education, in which two parents and three teachers participate, manages the teacher evaluation, which applies criteria set by the Ministry; after three unsatisfactory evaluations, teachers are dismissed. Hence, rules have been put into place which requires the teachers to meet certain standards by the government or the union themselves. This helps filter out those teachers that are not doing their job in a proper manner.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Teacher Unionization and the Quality of Education in Peru: an Empirical Evaluation using Survey Data|last=Zegarra|first=Eduardo|citeseerx = 10.1.1.581.2035}}</ref>\n\n'''Violence Against Labor Unions'''\n\nDue to their political activity, unions of Latin America have faced years of harassment. Often, police forces intervene in teachers' strikes in Latin America. For example, in Peru the teachers demanded the president to stick to his promises of higher wages for teachers and more money on education.  To justify the violence in response, the Peruvian government has called teachers terrorists and said they are trying to overthrow the government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2004/09/01/01militant.h24.html|title=Teachers' Unions in Latin America Take Militant Tack - Education Week|website=edweek.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref>  As another example, 2 picketting teachers in Chubut, Argentina were killed by a vehicle in an encounter with police, leading to a national solidarity strike.

There are many other factors that go into affecting the educational efficiency of a school. Violence of the area, parental influence or income of the school and the students families. It is possible that there are areas of affluent children in schools in which unions exist. Further studies are being conducted in order to precisely determine the direct effects of labor unions on the quality of education of students in Latin American schools. However the implementation of unions has been demonstrated to increase the professionalism among teachers, and unions can also lead to creation of competitive policies that can lead to a better education. Formation of unions also increase the number of teachers who are more dedicated towards their jobs.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Inclusive education in Latin America]]\n* [[Education in the Dominican Republic]]\n*[[Right to education|Right to Education]]\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Youth and changing realities: rethinking secondary education in Latin America\n| author = L\u00f3pez, N\u00e9stor; Opertti, Renato; Vargas Tamez, Carlos\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 15,18\n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247577E.pdf\n| license statement URL = http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=247577&set=0058CBE9E2_0_396&gp=1&lin=1&ll=1\n| license = CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Behind the numbers: ending school violence and bullying\n| author = UNESCO\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 70\n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000366483\n| license statement URL = \n| license = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Latin America|Latin America}}\n* [http://www.iadb.org/en/topics/education/education-initiative-in-latin-america,6887.html IDB Education Initiative]\n\n{{Latin America topics}}\n\n[[Category:Education in the Americas|Latin America]]\n[[Category:Latin America]]\n", "text_old": "Despite significant progress, education remains a challenge in [[Latin America]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Second Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study (SERCE) data indicate that, on average, 3rd and 6th grade students have access to only three books per student in the school library. Students from lower socioeconomic status have access to an average of one book per student, while students from higher socioeconomic status have access to eight books per student. A school's location is a high determinant of the number of books that a student will have, benefitting urban schools over rural schools.<ref name=\"iadb.org\">[http://www.iadb.org/document.cfm?id=35361923 ''Inter \u2013 American Development Bank'', Los Docentes las Escuelas y los Aprendizajes Escolares en Am\u00e9rica Latina: Un Estudio Regional Usando la Base de Datos del SERCE, February 7, 2011]</ref> With regards to educational technologies, while there has been an increase in [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT) access for [[Latin American]] children and adolescents in the last decade, along with a widespeard interest in One-to-One (1-1) computing models in the past 4 years, its access and use is still too limited to produce sufficient changes in the educational practices of teachers and students.

This slow growth has been a puzzle, because education and [[human capital]] is frequently identified as an important element of growth.  Yet, the relatively good performance of Latin America in terms of access and school attainment has not translated into good economic outcomes.  For this reason, many economists have argued that other factors such as economic institutions or financial crises must be responsible for the poor growth, and they have generally ignored any role for education in Latin American countries.<ref>For example, see Sebastion Edwards, Gerardo Esquivel, and Graciela M\u00e1rquez (eds.), ''The decline of Latin American economies: Growth, institutions, and crises'' (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 2007) or Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez-Arias, Rodolfo Manuelli, and Juan S. Blyde (eds.). ''Sources of growth in Latin America: What is missing?'' (Washington, DC: Inter-American Development Bank, 2005).</ref>  On the other hand, [[Eric Hanushek]] and [[Ludger Woessmann]] argue that the slow growth is directly related to the low achievement and poor learning that comes with each year of school in Latin America.<ref>[[Eric A.

Rotterdam: Sense Publishers.</ref> The fact that these three countries make up over half of the higher education student population in Latin America brings to light issues and further serves to illuminate on the current system of higher education and its lack of [[Equity (economics)|equity]] in opportunity. Although higher education is not new to the region; indeed, many institutions date back hundreds of years, but the noticeable growth spurt in the area of higher education has been more recent.\n\nThe past four decades have been a time of tremendous change and growth for Higher Education in the region. For example, institutional growth has resulted in a diversification of degrees offered to include more graduate degrees (Master's degrees, professional degrees and doctorates) and less traditional areas of study.<ref name=\"Tiana Ferrer 2014 pp. 125-136\"/> This increase in graduate degrees has presented challenges related to funding, especially in the public sector of education. Budgetary limitations in the late 20th century saw a surge of private universities in many Latin American countries.<ref name=\"Tiana Ferrer 2014 pp. 125-136\"/> These universities sprung up all over the region during the time period and continue to serve a particular subset of the population.  In general, Latin America is still subject to a developmental lag when it comes to education, and higher education in particular. The country of [[Brazil]] is the main exception to this \"developmental lag\".<ref name=\"Tiana Ferrer 2014 pp. 125-136\"/> Brazil boasts many of the top universities in Latin America, in some of the country's richest areas. That being said, no region or university is perfect.  One continuing problem is the persisting issue of how low amounts of money are invested into research and development in the region.<ref name=\"Tiana Ferrer 2014 pp. 125-136\"/>  This creates a lack of competition with other areas of the world and results in less innovation coming from the region. By investing comparatively low amounts of money into research and development, one can surmise that scholars and other scientists will be pulled to other regions of the world.\n\nIn addition, there is a need for regional accreditation programs valid beyond national borders.<ref name=\"Tiana Ferrer 2014 pp. 125-136\"/> An increase in accreditation programs could result in greater transfer of knowledge across universities and borders, be an incentive for more students to study in Latin American universities, and create greater cohesiveness in the region.\n\n===History===\n\n[[European colonization of the Americas|Colonization]] was of great significance to the course of higher education in Latin America, and the spirit of the colonial period was interwoven in the Church. \"In the 1800's, numerous countries, including Chile, Ecuador, and Colombia, signed contracts with the Catholic Church, or modeled their constitution on Catholic values, declaring themselves Catholic states.\"<ref>Eulich, W.

These universities, influenced by the  [[French Enlightenment]], came to be regulated by government rather than cooperative interests or the Church.  Growth and expansion of the university system was slowed due to political and financial instability; university life was regularly interrupted. In the 1840s Chile and Uruguay implemented an educational model that incorporated centralized Napoleonic lines which promoted the \"base education for the future leaders of the nation, as well as members of the bureaucracy and the military\".<ref>Markham, J.D.

The most visible confrontations took place in the late 1960's, a time of student mobilization worldwide. These protests were very frequent throughout the period in most countries in Latin America, reinforcing the image of a politically involved student movement, even if it was often fostered by the mobilization of a minority of student activists with representation in university governance and closely linked to national political movements and parties. In many cases, student confrontations with the authorities mixed radical demands for revolutionary change with more limited demands for organizational transformation and more generous funding\".<ref name=\"webcache.googleusercontent.com\"/> Argentina, for example, had an increasingly robust middle class population which demanded access to university education. Argentina's university system quickly expanded with the demand. \"Contemporary analysts have estimated that roughly 85 to 90 percent of Latin America's university students come from the middle class\".<ref name=\"Levy, D.C. (1986).\"/> That growth and prosperity of Argentina's middle class along with electoral rights, an increased migration to urban areas, and the universal suffrage law of 1912 empowered students to challenge conservative systems and voice their demands. In December 1917, the [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba|University of C\u00f3rdoba]] refused to concede to student demands for the university meet a perceived need. Students responded by organizing a mass protest; they refused to attend classes and hosted a demonstration on school grounds. They magnified the power of the student voice by including local politicians, labor groups, and student organizations. The primary goals of the student movement were to \"secularize and democratize C\u00f3rdoba University by expanding student and professor participation in its administration and modernizing the curricula\", and to make university education \"available and affordable by lifting entrance restrictions and establishing greater flexibility in attendance and examinations to accommodate low and middle-income students with work obligations\".

Examples of reforms in Colombia included following the North American Land Grant model, administrative reforms designed to target spending and asset waste, and employing more full-time professors.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> The university systems have been criticized for reflecting the culture in which they are set as opposed to strategically guiding culture through the pursuit of intellectual ideals and educational and vocational advancement. Having come through a period of reform trial and error, \"several Latin societies have already embarked on radical political paths and others exhibit willingness to explore novel alternatives.\" <ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> Moving into the future, Latin America will continue to develop their higher education programs to increase academic and social success through increased availability to all people.\n\n===Institutions in Latin American higher education===\n\nHigher education institutions in Latin America are private, public and federal colleges and universities. Most experts agree that there is no typical Latin American university as the universities must reflect the vast differences found within each country and region within Latin America.<ref name=\"Wit, H. 2005\">De Wit, H., Jaramillo, I.C., Gacel-Avila, J., & Knight, J. (Eds.). (2005). ''Higher Education in Latin America: The International Dimension''.

Latin America is facing many issues in the ever-expanding era of globalization. Their enrollments and their students must be prepared to participate in a more globalized world than ever before and they must have the institutions to support a more international mission. Scholars believe that there is tension among countries that defined modernity differently. Modernity within education will allow for progress with educational policy and research and particularly in [[comparative education]]. Defining [[modernity]] differently in each country does not allow for consensus on what a modern educational system could and should look like.<ref>Acosta, F., & Perez Centeno, C.G. (2011). \"Re-bordering comparative education in Latin America: Between global limits and local characteristics\".

More research must be done in this area to bolster the information on some of the smaller countries in parts of Latin America that do not have higher education options. Or who do have higher education options but are limited in number and scope. In a 2002 publication on higher education institutions in Latin American and Caribbean Universities, including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Uruguay, Venezuela, Mexico, Peru, Brazil and the Dominican Republic, 1,917 of them were considered private universities.<ref name=\"Wit, H. 2005\"/> In some countries, such as Brazil, there are state and federal higher education institutions in each state.  Federal universities in Brazil make up an enrollment of 600,000 student in 99 institutions throughout the country.<ref>Schwartzman, S. (2012). [https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/world-view/brazil-federal-higher-education-risk \"Brazil: Federal Higher Education at Risk. Inside Higher Ed.\"]</ref> More information on higher education specific to Brazil can be found here: [[Education in Brazil|Brazil]].\n\nAlternatively, 1,023 universities are considered public in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico and Peru. There are about 5,816 institutes that are considered private or public and even some were not deemed identifiable. Of both regions, Latin America and the Caribbean, there are nearly 14 million students enrolled in some type of higher education institution. Roughly 13,896,522 students are enrolled at institutions in Latin American where not quite 95,000 are enrolled in the Caribbean.<ref>UNESCO. (2005).World Report.</ref> Participation in higher education has seen an increase in enrollment from 1998 to 2001. In developed countries, the gross enrollment rate jumped from 45.6% to 54.6% in 2001.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Iberoamerican Network of Science and Technology (RICYT), Buenos Aires, 2002</ref> Additionally, female participation in enrollment jumped from 59.2% in 1998 to 64.3% in 2001. (unEsCo, 2005). Transitional and developing countries also saw a jump in gross enrollment rates from 1998 to 2001. Of the Latin American countries analyzed, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina had the highest distribution of enrollments. These top three countries accounted for about 60% of total enrollment in higher education.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Brazil led the Latin American countries by holding 28% of higher education enrollment in all of Latin America. Shortly behind Brazil is Mexico with 17% of the total enrollment and Argentina at 14%.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nSets of countries also distribute their enrollment among private and public universities differently as well. For example, Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic students are mostly enrolled in private sector higher education universities and institutions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Between 50% and 75% of total enrollments in the previously mentioned countries are within the private sector. Conversely, Ecuador, Mexico, Venezuela, Paraguay, Peru and Guatemala see between 50% and 75% of their enrollments within the public sector. Cuba, Uruguay, Bolivia, Panama, Honduras and Argentina see the vast majority of their total enrollment within the public sector as well. These countries see about 75% to 100% of their total enrollment attend public institutions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> There has been a clear trend in higher education in Latin America towards the commercialization and privatization of higher education.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This is a trend that is evident throughout the world when it comes to higher education. An increase in private schools meaning more private money which introduces more flexibility when it comes to funding programs and beginning innovation initiatives. Since 1994, enrollment in private institutions has increased nearly 8% to 46% (from 38%) of total enrollment in 2002. Public institutions have seen a decline, however, losing that 8% in total enrollments. Public institutions are down to 54% in 2002.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the Inter-American Development bank altered its focus to the introduction of community colleges and other short-cycle colleges in the region. Then, its lending programs for more traditional higher education declined.<ref name=\"Wit, H. 2005\"/> During this time, the World Bank became a major player in making large investments in several countries. The countries where the largest investments were made were Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela.<ref name=\"Wit, H. 2005\"/> The World Bank has also increased its funding efforts in Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Venezuela in the areas of science and technology research. The efforts by the [[World Bank]] are intended to support the modernization of higher education in major countries throughout Latin America. The funding was used for student aid, university grants, research grants and much more. The granting amounted to more than $1.5 billion since its initiative started.<ref name=\"Wit, H. 2005\"/>\n\nAreas of study vary widely amongst institutions in Latin America. The majority of students\u2019 fields of study are in social sciences, business and law. 42% of enrolled students are studying in social sciences, business and law. Whereas 14% are focusing on engineering, industry and construction. Just 10% are pursuing degrees in Education followed by sciences and health and social welfare each of which are at 9%.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Since the 1980s and into the 1990s, there have been many attempts to reform education in Latin American in direct response to the increased interested in globalization. Although globalization has significantly affected Latin American countries, Latin America as a whole remains out the outskirts of the global research and knowledge centers.<ref name=\"Wit, H. 2005\"/>\n\nOne of the more recent efforts established by a Latin American country to increase globalization and an interest in the [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]] (Science Technology Engineering and Math) fields is the Brazil Scientific Mobility Program. The initiative focuses on sending Brazilian undergraduate and graduate students to study in the United States for a limited period of time.<ref name=\"iie.org\">http://www.iie.org/Programs/Brazil-Scientific-Mobility/About</ref> Students must be majoring in a Brazilian institution in a STEM field in order to participate in the program. Participants are awarded a grant/scholarship that allows them to student in the United States for up to one year at a university with a focus in STEM-related areas. The initiative hopes to grant scholarships to Brazil's 100,000 best students in STEM fields.<ref name=\"iie.org\"/> The Brazilian Scientific Mobility Program also allows Brazilian students to master the English language by offering them time to take intensive English language courses before moving onto STEM content classes. Since its conception, more than 20,000 Brazilian students have been placed at universities through the United States.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.iie.org/Programs/Brazil-Scientific-Mobility/Host-Institution |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823031100/http://www.iie.org/Programs/Brazil-Scientific-Mobility/Host-Institution |archive-date=2015-08-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Additionally 475 U.S. host institutions have been involved in hosting either academic or intensive English students or in some instance providing both programs. The primary area of study for Brazilian scholarship grantees is engineering where 65% of program grantees are engineering majors.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The program goals complement the goals and areas of improvement from all of Latin America. The goals are to: \"To promote scientific research; To invest in educational resources, allocated both within Brazil, and internationally; To increase international cooperation within science and technology and To initiate and engage students in global dialogue.<ref name=\"iie.org\"/>\n\nIn order for Latin American countries to bolster their higher education efforts, they must work to massify their higher education system and make their scientific and technological capability more robust.<ref name=\"United Nations Educational 2014\">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. (2014). Regional Report about Education for All in Latin American and the Caribbean: Global Education for All meeting, Muscat, Oman, May 12th and 14th of 2014.</ref> Additionally, more outreach must be obtained amongst nearby societies and countries in order to build rapport and relationships that extend to higher education.  This could improve teacher training, collaboration in curriculum development and support schools in difficult student and teacher interactions. Finally, Latin America must be able to compete with the increased demands that globalization places upon higher education. Latin America must adapt their higher education institutions to reflect the globalization trend affecting higher education throughout the entire world.<ref name=\"United Nations Educational 2014\"/> The trend is already affecting higher education in Latin American countries with initiatives such as the Brazilian Scientific Mobility Program but those programs are few. Providing more opportunities for Latin American students to study abroad even to other Latin American countries could really benefits students to change their worldviews. Eventually, such programs could affect education policy in many Latin American countries providing a strong partnership across the world.\n\nTo learn more about education systems specific to a particular Latin American country, find their webpages here: [[Education in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Education in Bolivia|Bolivia]], [[Education in Chile|Chile]], [[Education in Colombia|Colombia]], [[Education in Ecuador|Ecuador]], [[Education in Venezuela|Venezuela]], [[Education in Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Education in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Education in Panama|Panama]], [[Education in the Bahamas|Bahamas]], [[Education in the Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic]], [[Education in Haiti|Haiti]], etc.\n\n===Higher education funding===\nLatin American countries have developed a strong economic growth during the 2000s- the first time since the [[Latin American debt crisis|debt crisis]] of the 1980s. In addition, with a \"demographic bonus\", in which the proportion of children declines and thus the older generation has increased the size of the [[working-age]] population. Thus, for aging societies, it is essential to invest in advanced human capital for the quality and productivity of a smaller work force. So, the expanding regional growth increases the financial resources to train more and better-qualified higher education graduates.<ref>De Fanelli, A.G. (2014). Financing Higher Education in Latin America. International Higher Education. (Vol. 74, pp. 22-24).</ref>\nIn Latin American countries, nearly half of enrollment in [[tertiary education]] is concentrated in institutions whose main source of funding is tuition and fees. Therefore, students and their parents are already contributing heavily to finance higher education institutions. Moreover, some of these countries charge tuition and fees to students at public universities; a prime example is Chile's public university sector.  In other countries where undergraduate programs in public institutions are free of charge and the majority of the enrollment is concentrated in the public sector (as in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]), the government is the principal source of funding. However, this is not the case with [[graduate degrees]] as students usually pay the tuition and fees at [[graduate schools]].\n\nIn most Latin American countries, with the exception of [[Chile]], negotiating the funding model is still the most relevant mechanism to distribute core higher education funding to institutions.<ref name=\"Gazzola, A.L. 2008\">Gazzola, A.L., & Didriksson, A. (2008). Trends in Higher Education in Latin American and the Caribbean. Bogota, Colombia: Panamerican Formas e Impresos, S.A.</ref> Additionally, since the late 1980s and 1990s, many of these governments have been allocating a small proportion of the total budget via formulas and funds to achieve specific objectives. Several Latin American countries took advantage of the boom years and raised their public and private investment in higher education. This also contributed to improving low-income students\u2019 access to these institutions.\n\nThe complexity of Higher Education in the region can be viewed in a series of historical and emerging trends, in its [[heterogeneity]], its inequality, but above all in the role that public universities and some very outstanding institutions of higher education can assume in order to construct a new scenario that can aid in significant improvement in the living conditions of its populations, and provide the possibility of greater well-being, democracy, and equality coming from science, education, and culture. The rest of this section will take a look at how Higher Education institutions in Latin America are funded. Changes have been occurring and the funding models appear to be moving targets.\n\nLatin America is diverse with twenty sovereign states that stretch from the southern border of the [[United States]] to the southern tip of [[South America]]. With this much space and diversity, the funding for higher education can vary from state to state.\n\nThere seem to be four prevalent models for the financing of higher education in Latin America. These four models apply indiscriminately and in different combinations in the countries of the region, thus reflecting the diversity one observes in the region in terms of financing and policies and outcomes.<ref name=\"Gazzola, A.L. 2008\"/> The four prevalent models for financing Higher Education in Latin America are:\n\n# Direct public financing, provided to eligible institutions through the regular state budget, usually through legislative approval and through the respective ministry responsible for financial matters. The receiving institutions are state universities; this is, formal dependencies of state authority, which academics contracted through the public service, and with the application of management norms being those that are applicable to the public sector in general. Exceptions to this are the cases of [[Chile]] and [[Nicaragua]], where for historical reasons, private institutions also receive this kind of public financing. In many states various conditions have been established for the use of the funds, thus restricting the autonomy of their institutional management. Some countries have attempted to make this fixed-base form of providing resources to Higher Education more flexible through budgetary review based on academic results.<ref name=\"Gazzola, A.L. 2008\"/> \n# Policy objective-based public financing. This treats resources that are usually not recurrent, included in special funds of a transitory nature or for attaining specific objectives or achievements of universities or institutions of Higher Education that those funds help to finance. Many of the objectives or goals established have to do with teaching, especially taking into account the numbers and quality of students (the case of the Indirect Fiscal Contribution in [[Chile]]), or with achievements in the area of research (funds in the case of [[Venezuela]]), or for graduate training (The CAPES model of [[Brazil]]). Less progress has been made in terms of programs that include negotiations with the state and competition between institutions in order to obtain funds based on management commitments.  The Chilean experience regarding MECESUP (improvement of quality and equity in Higher Education) funds fostered this purpose, but the results in terms of sustainable achievements are still to be seen. In Argentina, the case of FOMEC (implemented competitive funds) is alike, with resources aimed at real investment programs. It is important to mention Brazil in this regard. The Ministry of Education established a program called PROUNI in 2005 with the purpose of optimizing the use of enrolment places offered by private universities.  In effect, the excess of unused enrolment places, which tends to diminish efficiency in the provision of private education leads to an offer by the public sector to acquire them at a tuition cost below that originally charged. In this regard, the incentive for universities to fill their places and foster a greater absorption of students in the Higher Education system, giving preference for grants to student with the greatest financial need. In the short term, the government seeks to have some 400,000 students participating in this system, a figure that in 2006 was 250,000 students.<ref name=\"Gazzola, A.L. 2008\"/> \n# Private financing occurs through the payment of tuition on the part of families, by companies that finance research and graduate programs, or thorough private individuals or companies that make donations to institutions of Higher Education. The charging of student tuition is not only a practice carried out by multiple new universities that have emerged throughout the region. Charging for the cost of education has also been transformed into a practice that increasingly occurs in state universities as well- a situation that [[Chile]] is notorious for. Tuition charges and the ways in which this takes place is a controversial political theme in most countries, since it tends to reserve Higher Education for an elite, and has a negative long-term impact on the distribution of income. However, it is clear without greater financial commitment from states, further expansion of Higher Education can only be attained, once existing residual resources of the institutions have been used, only through a reduction of quality.  This has placed in relief the emergence of [[accreditation]] institutions and procedures aimed being used as an instrument of control or at least of information, regarding private expansion and the progressive privatization of the state sector. In regard to the existence of private donations as a financing mechanism for Higher Education, the regulatory structure for doing so is extremely fragile in most Latin American countries.  There is also a culture of distrust toward the public sector and academia in general terms, which also affects the possibility of establishing private company-university strategic alliances for financing and execution of projects with productive applications.  From the university side, there is an [[anti-capitalist]] sentiment that sees the desire for profit as a negative influence on scientific and technological research.<ref name=\"Gazzola, A.L. 2008\"/>\n# A mixed model, that combines state financing, both fixed and by objectives and goals, with private financing based on the direct payment from students or through other mechanisms or private funding. The Chilean case is one of these (in which the state university sector collects monthly charges).  The Mexico system is trying to grow the public resources allocated by objectives and goals.  In [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Peru]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], countries for which information exists, between 10% ([[Costa Rica]]) and 38% ([[Peru]]) of the incomes of institutions of Higher Education come from their own resources generated by private activities.<ref name=\"Gazzola, A.L. 2008\"/>\nTuition charges have progressively become a reality in institutions of Higher Education in Latin America. Public and state universities face serious structural financial problems, especially because their resources embrace teaching, research, and extension, including the production of public goods that do not necessarily have an explicit financial counterpart. These universities also obey a number of public regulation which often raise their costs significantly. Financial restrictions oblige them to cover at least part of their costs based on student fees.  This has led to profound and sustained conflicts. The conversations around funding Higher Education in Latin America are ongoing.\n\nOverall, Latin American countries have made great progress in improving their education systems, particular in the last two decades. The governments have increased spending on education, expanded cooperation with the [[United States]], the [[World Bank]], and other donors, and pledged to achieve certain educational milestones established through the Organization of American States' Summit of the Americas process.  However, despite these recent improvements, Latin America's education indicators still lag behind the [[developed world]] and many [[developing countries]] of comparable income levels in [[East Asia]].<ref>Seelke, C.R. (2007).

This issue includes economic equality, disparity amongst [[socioeconomic]] classes and therefore access to higher education. As mentioned above, a majority of higher education students within Latin America come from the middle class. But one must look at what this actually means:  Latin America currently showcases the lowest rates of income distribution (across society), especially when compared to other parts of the [[industrialized world]]. In addition, levels of social injustice are extremely high if one takes into account distribution of income as a central element to the concept of social justice. A massive gap exists when it comes to income distribution in many Latin American countries.  Despite progress and development, the pervasive poverty is exacerbated by the \"concentration of wealth in some groups, together with low labor  participation (unemployment and underemployment) in many countries [which] represents one of the unmet challenges for the region\".<ref name=Trends>''Trends in Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean''. Ana L\u00facia Gazzola & Axel Didriksson, Editors</ref> This \"unmet challenge\" will, until addressed, result in increased inequality and access to higher education. And even though the region is growing economically and in population, this is not enough.  Further, \"In the face of the challenge of inequality, it is not enough to grow economically at a higher rate. It is necessary to grow toward greater social equity. This inequality, one of the most serious in the world, will tend to continue and to worsen if we do not change the current focuses of many government policies\".<ref name=Trends/>\n\nOrganizations which link higher education between Latin America and Europe include Al\u00dfAN (now ERASMUS Mundos), ALFA and AlInvest. The ALFA Program of co-operation between Higher Education Institutions (HEI's) of the European Union and Latin America \"began in 1994 and sought to reinforce co-operation in the field of Higher Education. The program co-finances projects aimed at improving the capacity of individuals and institutions (universities and other relevant organizations) in the two regions\".<ref>http://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/peru/eu_peru/tech_financial_cooperation/regional_cooperation_la/index_en.htm Accessed August 5, 2015</ref> Al\u00dfAN provided scholarships to Latin American students, but was replaced in 2010 by ERASMUS Mundos, which provides avenues for Latin American students to study in Europe. ERASMUS Mundos also fosters community and cooperation between Latin America and the European Union. The program provides joint masters and doctoral programs, including a scholarship scheme. It has the aim of \"mobility flows of students and academics between European and non-European higher education institutions [and the] promotion of excellence and attractiveness of European higher education worldwide...The European Commission informs potential applicants about funding opportunities through a program guide and regular calls for proposals published on the Erasmus Mundus website\".<ref>http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/peru/travel_eu/study_eu/index_en.htm Accessed August 5, 2015</ref>\n\nOrganizations exist to foster cooperation between Latin American and North American higher education, as well. The Ibero-American University Council (CUIB) and the Latin American Network for the Accreditation and Quality of Higher Education are two such organizations. \"Latin American and North American cooperation is often labeled inter-American and is exemplified by organizations such as the Inter-American Organization for Higher Education (IOHE) and the Organization of American States (OAS )\".<ref name=\"siteresources.worldbank.org\">http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTLACREGTOPEDUCATION/Resources/Higher_Ed_in_LAC_Intnal_Dimension.pdf Accessed August 5, 2015</ref> According to the World Bank, the Latin American region is \"defined in a cultural and geographical sense. It includes all the countries from Mexico to Argentina. Organizations such as the Latin American Universities Union and the Institute for Higher Education in Latin America and Caribbean are good examples of regional organizations. Sub-regional organizations include the Montevideo Group University Association (AUGM), the Association of Universities of the Amazon (UNAMAZ), and the Council of University Presidents for the Integration of the West-Central Sub-Region of South America (CRISCO)\".<ref name=\"siteresources.worldbank.org\"/>\n\nAccording to ''The Economist'', \"Latin America boasts some giant universities and a few venerable ones: the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) enroll several hundred thousand students apiece, while Lima's San Marcos was founded in 1551. Even so, the region is hardly synonymous with excellence in higher education. Research output is unimpressive, teaching techniques are old-fashioned and students drop out in droves. These failings matter. Faster economic growth is driving a big rise in demand for higher education in the region and a large crop of new universities\".<ref name=Economist>[http://www.economist.com/node/21531468#cwvrGyfPV42lT7YT.99 ''The Economist''], 8 October 2011.

The [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo]] (USP), the richest and biggest university in Brazil's richest state, came top\".<ref name=Economist/>\n\n== Gender Gap ==\nIn the midst of an educational crisis in Latin America, there is a gender gap present within the schooling system. Various regions in Latin American countries are affected differently by the gap due to inter-sectional factors, such as economic state and societal beliefs. Generally, higher dropout rates plague rural regions, where children are pressured to work, opposed to suburban regions.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001310/131040e.pdf|title=Gender Equality in Basic Education in Latin America and the Caribbean|date=March 2002}}</ref> Generally, rural areas lack the relative amount of resources that urban areas have, and families living in these areas experience poverty at greater frequencies.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iadb.org/res/publications/pubfiles/pubwp-600.pdf|title=The Educational Gender Gap in Latin America and the Caribbean|last=Duryea|first=Suzanne|last2=Galiani|first2=Sebastian|date=April 2007|publisher=Research Department of the Inter-American Development Bank|last3=Nopo|first3=Hugo|last4=Piras|first4=Claudia}}</ref> Their economic disadvantage leads these families to send their male children to school, rather than female children, when they are given the option. This decision has resulted in lower enrollment rates in school for female children.<ref name=\":03\" /> The gap in enrollment is present starting from basic education, which has been defined in literature as the stage of education that encompasses childhood education, primary school, and early stages of secondary school.<ref name=\":03\" /> Research suggests greater prevalence of gender differences in higher education. Generally, early education is free and higher education requires tuition costs. Consequently, enrollment rates are more dependent on income levels instead of gender. Even among the wealthiest group of individuals, females are less likely to participate in higher education than males.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nIn previous decades, females achieved lower levels and less years of education compared to males, even in more economically developed countries. However, as time progressed, the gender gap began to shrink at a rate of approximately 0.27 years of schooling per decade.<ref name=\":12\" /> From the 1960s, the gap began to shift towards the favor of females; females are attending more years of school and differences in enrollment rates between the sexes are diminishing.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nSocietal expectations of boys and girls in these countries have a major influence on these dropout rates. The gender roles created by society often vary across cultures, as do the expectations of the type of responsibilities that female and male children will take on in the household. Boys are expected to provide for the household under domestic economic strain. Despite having a higher enrollment rate, male children experience higher dropout rates and attain lower levels of education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.iadb.org/bitstream/handle/11319/4735/Social%20Exclusion%20in%20Education%20in%20Latin%20America%20and%20the%20Caribbean.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|title=Social Exclusion in Education in Latin America and the Caribbean|last=Marshall|first=Jeffery H.|last2=Calderon|first2=Valentina|date=February 2006}}</ref> Similarly, female children in rural regions experience higher dropout rates after domestic emergencies, in order to care for the family and household.<ref name=\":03\" /> However, when granted the opportunity, females contribute to higher promotion rates and are less likely to repeat years of schooling.<ref name=\":12\" /> Differences due to societal expectations still exist in more economically advantaged Latin American countries and regions, but at lower rates and with more equality between the sexes.\n\n=== Migration ===\nThe gender gap in education also contributes to the unique experience of migrants from Latin America. If young adults and children anticipate that they will be migrating, then they are less likely to attend to school in their native country, and less likely to value its importance. A common belief, cited as a reason for this phenomenon, is that they feel education will not make a difference when they are working overseas.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|last=Bejarano|first=Christina E.|last2=Manzano|first2=Sylvia|last3=Montoya|first3=Celeste|date=2011|title=Tracking the Latino Gender Gap: Gender Attitudes across Sex, Borders and Generations|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1426ebf4add7ca93294200b602aeee5133884ee8|journal=Politics and Gender|volume=7|issue=4|pages=521\u2013549|doi=10.1017/S1743923X11000341}}</ref> Contrarily, individuals who have access to education, and obtain an education in their native country, view the importance of education upon migration differently. These individuals believe that education will bring about more opportunities for them upon migration.<ref name=\":22\" /> Whether or not one views education as a beneficial factor to their migration is likely due to their cultural norms, which encourage different roles for boys and girls. Women are expected to take care of their parents, and for those who assume this cycle continues when they have children, their desire to attend school diminishes.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=Pessar|first=Patricia R.|last2=Mahler|first2=Sarah J.|date=Fall 2003|title=Transnational Migration: Bringing Gender In|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx7dFWXNGLJFaFlkM1NBaDNCTE0/view|journal=The International Migration Review|volume=37 |issue=3|pages=812\u2013846|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7379.2003.tb00159.x}}</ref> First generation immigrant women are most influenced by the more liberal social norms in the United States; they are presented with higher availability of education and employment. Once in the United States, 54% are employed outside of their homes, and 87% of those who are employed outside the home work in jobs consistent with their gender roles. Typically, women working these jobs did not receive an education in their native country.<ref name=\":22\" /> Men are also influenced by the opportunities that women have in the country, as they are used to being granted the educational and employment opportunities back home. Upon migration to the United States, men long to go back to their native country earlier than women. Gender roles create a sense of power among men, and being presented with liberal gender roles for women often takes away the sense of power they may have felt back home.<ref name=\":32\" /> Factors such as income, cultural beliefs, and region influence how one experiences the gender differences that accompany education and migration.<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\n\n== Educational Labor Unions in Latin America ==\n\n'''Effects of Labor Union on Latin American education'''\n\nGiven the increased trend of children enrolling into schools, the resources of Latin American educational systems have become increasingly strained with poor students who require additional public resources for success.,<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001310/131040e.pdf|title=Gender Equality in Basic Education in Latin America and the Caribbean|date=March 2002}}</ref><ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iadb.org/res/publications/pubfiles/pubwp-600.pdf|title=The Educational Gender Gap in Latin America and the Caribbean|last=Duryea|first=Suzanne|last2=Galiani|first2=Sebastian|date=April 2007|publisher=Research Department of the Inter-American Development Bank|last3=Nopo|first3=Hugo|last4=Piras|first4=Claudia}}</ref>  On recent tests of mathematics and science, around half of Latin American students scored below the lowest proficiency levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.focal.ca/es/publications/focalpoint/258-june-2010-tamara-ortega-goodspeed|title=Latin America's education challenges call for concrete action|last=Mestechkin|first=Ruth|website=focal.ca|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref> These problems are combatted through the formation of teachers labor unions.\n\n'''Effects of Labor Unions'''\n\nFrom 1989 to 1997, the number of countries with national testing systems has increased 2 to 21. These reforms have continued throughout the 2000s, several countries starting in 2006 have set national standards including Nicaragua, Colombia, and Argentina. The changing policies have brought teachers\u2019 union under the light as important policy actors. Studies conducted by Murillo on labor unions in Peru have shown that labor unions have improved student achievement overall by retaining experienced teachers and lowering class sizes; although strikes, a key means by which unions exert power over policy,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unionplus.org/page/how-do-unions-work|title=How do Unions Work?|website=Union|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref> negatively impacts students affected by them. It was found that school days that were lost to strikes consequently lowered the exam scores of the students. It was also found that tenure, a common demand of teachers' unions, has increased student achievement in classes, even despite increased days of teacher absence because of the job security which these teachers felt. There has also been evidence that formation of unions has allowed in a decrease of classroom sizes. On average there is one less student per every teacher which allows for teachers to spend more time with an individual student.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|title=Teacher Unionization and the Quality of Education in Peru: an Empirical Evaluation using Survey Data|last=Zegarra|first=Eduardo|date=2002|citeseerx = 10.1.1.581.2035}}</ref>\n\n'''Professionalization of Teachers in Unions'''\n\nSpecifically in Argentina the union has played an important role in the formation of accredited professional development courses. In 1994 CTERA signed an agreement with UNC and started a series of teacher training programs. In 2000, two graduate tracks were developed and more than 1600 teachers were trained. Teachers who are actively involved in the union develop a sense of professionalism through the experience of organizing. Because teachers\u2019 union activity centers on particular education  projects formed by the union itself, involvement in the formation of education goals and initiatives shapes teachers\u2019 sense of their worth as practitioners. Therefore, participation in the union allows teachers to deepen their knowledge, commitment and practice. In Brazil, from 1998-2002 the union published their enrolled members final assignments for the class. Peruvian education is characterized by high coverage and extremely low expenditures per student. Specific programs such as MECEP has increased inputs and training for teachers hoping to enhance education system.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gindin|first=Juli\u00e1n|date=2013|title=Promoting Education Quality: the Role of Teachers' Unions in Latin America|url=|journal=Education for All Global Monitoring Report 2013/4|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n'''Addition of Incentives'''\n\nIn countries like Brazil and Chile \u201cincentive schemes\u201d were initiated. An incentive scheme is a policy which financially awards the teachers. However resistance has been noticed depending on the type of the incentive. Teachers from many Latin American countries have opposed incentives based on the evaluations of teachers themselves (Ecuador, Peru, Chile and partially Mexico) or of student's test scores (Ecuador, Peru, Chile and partially Mexico). The addition of incentives can lead to both positive and negative impacts. Some of the positive factors will include a teacher's dedication towards their work to improve the overall level of education of all students. These methods also help filter out teachers who are not the best teachers. If a teacher's performance is not meeting the set standards then it is a sign that something is wrong and a change is required. If incentives involve rewards then high scores among a few students can boost  the overall average. In such cases  a teacher might focus the bulk of their attention towards the brighter students and neglecting the other kids.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''Bolivia'''\n\nEducation in rural areas  of Bolivia have been a problem because people in these areas belong to poor farming families. These areas consist people of indigenous people and who don't have a lot money therefore are unable to afford an education. An organization known as the CONMERB started a teaching proposal in 1983 known as the \u201cGlobal plan for the restructuring of rural education in Bolivia\u201d. This plan called for bilingual and bicultural education and was promoted at union events. This program took a progressive turn when President Morales decreased the National Literacy Program for the republic of Bolivia in April 2006. At that point 13.7% of Bolivian population was considered illiterate but by 2009, Bolivia had declared itself as an illiteracy free zone and was subsequently congratulated by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''Peru'''\n\nIn Peru, the government of Alan Garc\u00eda (2005-2011) promulgated a reform of the Teachers\u2019 Statute without negotiating with the Trade Union of Education Workers of Peru (SUTEP). The reform was proposed along with a series of other anti-union measures (for example, the government reduced the number of union leaders who could be exempted from their teaching duties to concentrate on union tasks). Public Educator Law No. 29,062 was enacted in 2007 amid an indefinite SUTEP strike explicitly against this bill. One of the biggest points of contention was the proposed evaluation of teacher performance. In the law's current form, the Committee for Evaluation of Education, in which two parents and three teachers participate, manages the teacher evaluation, which applies criteria set by the Ministry; after three unsatisfactory evaluations, teachers are dismissed. Hence, rules have been put into place which requires the teachers to meet certain standards by the government or the union themselves. This helps filter out those teachers that are not doing their job in a proper manner.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Teacher Unionization and the Quality of Education in Peru: an Empirical Evaluation using Survey Data|last=Zegarra|first=Eduardo|citeseerx = 10.1.1.581.2035}}</ref>\n\n'''Violence Against Labor Unions'''\n\nDue to their political activity, unions of Latin America have faced years of harassment. Often, police forces intervene in teachers' strikes in Latin America. For example, in Peru the teachers demanded the president to stick to his promises of higher wages for teachers and more money on education.  To justify the violence in response, the Peruvian government has called teachers terrorists and said they are trying to overthrow the government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2004/09/01/01militant.h24.html|title=Teachers' Unions in Latin America Take Militant Tack - Education Week|website=edweek.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref>  As another example, 2 picketting teachers in Chubut, Argentina were killed by a vehicle in an encounter with police police, leading to a national solidarity strike.  After the national strike, the government met the teachers' demands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsclick.in/teachers-win-pay-rise-argentina-after-4-month-strike|title=Teachers Win Pay Rise in Argentina after 4 Month Strike |website=https://www.newsclick.in/teachers-win-pay-rise-argentina-after-4-month-strike|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>  These demands included repairs to school facilities, shown to improve student retention.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n'''Difficulty in Assessing Effect of Labor Union on Education'''\n\nThere is a lot of difficulty in analyzing the effect of Labor Unions on Education. There are many other factors that go into affecting the educational efficiency of a school. Violence of the area, parental influence or income of the school and the students families. It is possible that there are areas of affluent children in schools in which unions exist. Further studies are being conducted in order to precisely determine the direct effects of labor unions on the quality of education of students in Latin American schools. However the implementation of unions has been demonstrated to increase the professionalism among teachers, and unions can also lead to creation of competitive policies that can lead to a better education. Formation of unions also increase the number of teachers who are more dedicated towards their jobs.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Inclusive education in Latin America]]\n* [[Education in the Dominican Republic]]\n*[[Right to education|Right to Education]]\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Youth and changing realities: rethinking secondary education in Latin America\n| author = L\u00f3pez, N\u00e9stor; Opertti, Renato; Vargas Tamez, Carlos\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 15,18\n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247577E.pdf\n| license statement URL = http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=247577&set=0058CBE9E2_0_396&gp=1&lin=1&ll=1\n| license = CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Behind the numbers: ending school violence and bullying\n| author = UNESCO\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 70\n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000366483\n| license statement URL = \n| license = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Latin America|Latin America}}\n* [http://www.iadb.org/en/topics/education/education-initiative-in-latin-america,6887.html IDB Education Initiative]\n\n{{Latin America topics}}\n\n[[Category:Education in the Americas|Latin America]]\n[[Category:Latin America]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEducational Labor Unions in Latin America:Typo fixing, replaced: police police \u2192 police", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Latin_America"}

The [[Communal work|bee]], held every year since 1989, is open to students in the fourth through eighth grades in participating schools from the [[United States]].<ref>http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geobee/</ref>\n\nThe entities represented at the national level come from all fifty [[U.S. states]], all the [[U.S. territories|territories]], the [[Department of Defense Dependents Schools]] (DoDDS), and the [[District of Columbia]].\n\nThe National Geographic Bee Finals was moderated by ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' host [[Alex Trebek]] for its first 25 years (1989-2013). However, at the [[25th National Geographic Bee|2013 National Geographic Bee]], Trebek announced that 2013 would be his last year hosting the Finals. Newscaster [[Soledad O'Brien]] took his place the following year, moderating the bee in [[26th National Geographic Bee|2014]] and [[27th National Geographic Bee|2015]]. O'Brien was then replaced by [[Mo Rocca]] in [[28th National Geographic Bee|2016]] and Rocca has been moderating the Bee since then.\n\nThe current champion is Nihar Janga, from [[Canyon Ridge Middle School]] in [[Austin, Texas]]. He is the 31st Champion. In 2020, the Bee was cancelled due to the evolving health crisis, [[COVID-19]].<ref name=update>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/education/student-experiences/geobee/|title=UPDATE ON THE 2020 GEOBEE|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d.|website=National Geographic|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Procedure==\n\n===School competitions===\nThe competition begins at the [[Elementary school (United States)|elementary school]] and middle school levels (4th grade - 8th grade) and usually occurs in November, December, or January. This competition requires at least 6 people to enter. Private schools, public schools, and homeschooled students are allowed to enter. Typically, between five and six million students are entered each year (any number of competitors may enter this competition). The two major stages in this competition are called the preliminary and the final stages. Often, the preliminary competition is further split into preliminary rounds and a semi-final. In the event of a tie, a [[tiebreaker]] round is held at the end of the preliminary rounds.\n\nIn the preliminary rounds, competitors are divided into groups of twenty and each contestant is asked one question from each of the seven themed rounds.  Categories include:\n*[[Cultural geography|Cultural Geography]]\n*[[Economic geography|Economic Geography]]\n*[[Geography of the United States|Across-the-Country]], [[World (geography)|Around-the-World]]\n*[[Science]]\n* Geographic Comparisons\n*[[Physical geography|Physical Geography]]\n* Odd-Item-Out (a category where one contestant is given three choices, plus a description. The contestant must determine which of the three choices does not fit.)\nContestants are awarded 1 point per question. At the end of seven rounds, players with the top ten scores advance to the finals. In addition to the game, a player may ask for a repeat of a [[spelling]] during these rounds. However, they are restricted to only asking twice in duration of the entire geographic bee.\n\nQuite often there is a [[Tie (draw)|tie]], in which case a semi-final tiebreaker round is needed. For example, if six players finished the preliminary rounds with eight points and fifteen finished with seven points, the six who finished with eight points automatically advance to the final competition. The fifteen with seven points move into the semi-final round where the top four are determined to fill the remainder of the seats in the finals. This is done by asking every player the same question at the same time and giving each player twelve seconds to write down the answer. Each question is automatically repeated twice.  Everyone reveals their answer at the end of the twelve seconds and players are eliminated on a single-elimination basis.  If, using the above example of four open seats in the finals, there is a question where eight players are left in the semi-final round and three players get the question right, those three advance to the finals. The other five who got the question wrong will continue with the single-elimination procedure to determine which competitor will take the last open seat in the finals. A player cannot ask judges to spell or repeat words in the semi-final round.\n\nThe final competition consists of two parts: the final round and the championship round. Each of the ten finalists starts with a clean slate and is eliminated after two incorrect answers. This continues until the number of contestants drops from ten to two and a third-place finisher is determined. A player is not officially eliminated until the end of a series of questions, since if all but one competitor makes their second miss in that round, all the players stay in the competition. Again, a player may ask for a spelling or repeat on any question, but only once per question. Earlier in the round, questions may require oral answers or written answers from all the competitors at one time. Quite often, many of the earlier questions in this round contain visuals as part of the question, such as [[map]]s or pictures. Question examples in the past have included pictures of state quarters with the name rubbed off and maps of the US with national forests shown and numbered. Contestants, at the time, were given the name of the national forest and (he or she) must match states with trees. At the national level, competitions may include items such as [[flag]]s, [[musical instrument]]s, [[hat]]s, and even live animals. After a certain round, all questions must require oral answers only.\n\nIf there is a tie for the championship round or third place, there will be an elimination round. For example, if four players are left and three make their second mistake, the fourth advances to the championship round and the other three enter the tiebreaker. The moderator will then ask each of the three players, at the same time, to write their answers to the same question. In this special round, questions can be repeated by players but they cannot ask how to spell a given word. As a result, if one of three responses are correct, he or she will rise to the championship round and the other two will move to the tiebreaker round until a third-place winner determined.\n\nIn the championship round, both players start with a clean slate again. The moderator asks both contestants the same question at the same time, repeated twice, and both players have fifteen seconds to write their answer. Both players then show their answers and each player who wrote a correct answer receives one point. There are three questions in the championship round. The player with the most points at the end is the champion. If both players are tied at the end, the competition enters the championship tiebreaker round. The rules are the same as for the championship round, except that the last player to answer a question incorrectly is the runner-up.\n\nIn 2010, National Geographic partnered with mobile development company [[Concentric Sky]] to launch a series of official app-based study tools titled Geobee Challenge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/web/business/24893551-46/concentric-national-geographic-skipper-sky.csp<|title=Tech company aiming high|last=Buri McDonald|first= Sherri|date=June 15, 2010|website=The Register-Guard|access-date= May 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Qualifying Test '''\n\nThe Qualifying Test is the only part of the bee that is entirely written. Every school champion takes this test to see if he or she can qualify for the state bee. The test comprises 70 multiple choice questions, which must be completed in 60 minutes. The top 100 scorers in each state or territory advance to the state level competition. Beginning with the 2016 Bee, the Qualifying test is online, and no longer is administered on paper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patch.com/new-york/wantagh/wantagh-student-heading-states-national-geographic-bee|title= |last=Doyle|first=Heather|date=March 19, 2015|website=Patch|access-date=May 18, 2019}}\n</ref>\n\n===State and national competitions===\nThe winner of each school-level competition takes an online test, and the top 100 in each state or territory qualify for the State Bee. If there is a tie in the State Qualifying Test, all students in the tie get an invitation to the State Bee (i.e. there were 107 State Bee Qualifiers in the 2019 Michigan State Geographic Bee). The rules at the state level are same as that at the school level, except that there are eight preliminary rounds instead of seven and each player is limited to two repeats or spelling for all eight preliminary rounds. Players are also limited to two repeats or spellings in the final round if they qualify. All the state bees are held on the same date, at the same time (in early April or late March) at all locations. State bees originally occurred for the fifty states, five U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands), [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Department of Defense Dependent Schools]] (DoDDS), for a total of 57. In 1999, the state competitions for Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana Islands were merged into one state competition known as the Pacific Territories, bringing the number down to 55. In 2009, the Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands competitions were merged into a single competition known as the Atlantic Territories, and since then there have only been 54 state and territory competitions.  For completions that involve students spread out across wide areas, such as the competitions like the DoDDS and Pacific Territories competitions, there is no in person competition such as in other states.  Instead, after winning the school bee, school champions from around these territories take a series of online tests to determine the territory champion.  The third-place finisher from each state receives $100, the second-place finisher $300, and the winner $1000.  The 54 state champions receive an all-expense-paid trip to Washington, D.C., for the national competition.\n\nThe rules at the national level are the same as those at the state, except that there are ten preliminary rounds instead of eight. There was previously a video part of the preliminary competition where students submitted a video worth six points, but was replaced by a written \"GeoChallenge\" worth ten points. The championship round can also consist of five questions instead of three. The competition is held over four days, with the preliminary rounds on the first day and the final rounds on the third. The national finals are held in late May at [[National Geographic Society]] headquarters in Washington, D.C. and are hosted by [[Mo Rocca]]. The ten finalists are guaranteed $1000. The third-place finisher receives a $5,000 college scholarship, the second-place finisher receives a $10,000 college scholarship, and the National Champion receives a $25,000 college scholarship, as well as a lifetime membership in the [[National Geographic Society]]. From 2009 to 2015, the National Champion also won a trip to the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]]. In 2016, National Champion Rishi Nair won a trip to southeast [[Alaska]], including a stop at [[Glacier Bay National Park]]. This was because 2016 was the centenary of the [[National Park Service|U.S. National Park Service]]. 2017 National Champion, Pranay Varada, received a trip to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. The National Competition final round format is also different from state. Originally, it was the same format, but in 2012, National Geographic changed the format so that correct answers were worth points and competitors could earn extra points with bonus questions, with eliminations being every few rounds. In 2015, they changed the format once again. There are no longer bonus questions, and the first five rounds are USA based and worth one point for most questions. The fifth round is a \u201clightning round\u201d where you are asked three rapid fire questions. Then, four students with the lowest scores are eliminated, a tie being broken with a tiebreaker about estimation. The next four rounds are global and are all worth two points per question, and end again with another lightning round. After this, the top three are left. There are two \u201cGeoChallenges\u201d in the final competition, one worth three points in round 3, and for the top ten a 45-second oral response worth six points. The top two then compete in a normal championship round.  In 2019, however, due to the introduction of a new competition that is called the \u201cGeochallenge\u201d(which is about developing a collaborative team project to tackle a given issue) they once again changed the format of the Bee.  The Semi-Finals, which consists of the top 10 contestants, is held on one day.  There are eight rounds of oral and written questions, and the four lowest scores are eliminated after these eight rounds.  Afterwards, there is a \u201cGeochallenge\u201d worth ten points, and three contestants are eliminated to narrow the competition down to the final three.  The next day, the top three contestants compete in the finals.  They have a series of five oral rounds, and then they have a Geochallenge round and a mapmaker round.  Afterwards, the lowest scoring contestant is eliminated, and a normal championship round occurs to determine the champion.\n\n===List of Moderators===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The top finishers from each country's national competition formed a team representing their country and participated in an [[Olympics|Olympic]]-style event which included a team written competition and a team oral competition. The 2013 competition was held in [[Saint Petersburg, Russia]]. The 2015 [[National Geographic World Championship]], originally planned to take place in [[Stockholm, Sweden]], was canceled, and the competition was since put on hiatus.\n\n===Criticism===\nSome argue that the selection process of the National Geographic GeoBee competition is not well designed to reliably promote the most qualified contestants, as it leaves significant room for chance. This is due to the small number of questions and the fact that each contestant answers different questions.<ref>http://www.nationalgeographic.org/bee/faq</ref> Particularly, during the preliminary rounds contestants are eliminated with a single mistake if there are more than 9 perfect scores.\nThe fact that a single mistake is not a reliable indicator for a contestant's overall strength was demonstrated during the [[26th National Geographic Bee|2014 National competition]]. The preliminary rounds resulted in 9 contestants with perfect score who accordingly became finalists. The 10th spot was filled by tie breaker rounds between contestants who made a single mistake during the preliminaries and went to the Virginia champion [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/140521-geography-bee-national-geographic-world-scholarship-students/ Akhil Rekulapelli], who then went on to win the finals. Again in 2019, Nihar Janga was involved in a tiebreaker to advance to the top 10, and he went on to win the entire competition.  Some also argue that the Geobee is becoming too focused on Geochallenge rounds instead of standard geography questions.  This was demonstrated in 2019, where more than half the total points in the semifinal and final rounds were based on these open ended \u201cGeochallenge\u201d questions.  Some also criticize the gender imbalance of the Geobee; only two girls have ever won the contest.\n\n==Champions==\n\n===National Champions===\nOf the thirty-one National Geographic GeoBee champions, twenty-nine have been male and two were female.

The [[Communal work|bee]], held every year since 1989, is open to students in the fourth through eighth grades in participating schools from the [[United States]].<ref>http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geobee/</ref>\n\nThe entities represented at the national level come from all fifty [[U.S. states]], all the [[U.S. territories|territories]], the [[Department of Defense Dependents Schools]] (DoDDS), and the [[District of Columbia]].\n\nThe National Geographic Bee Finals was moderated by ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' host [[Alex Trebek]] for its first 25 years (1989-2013). However, at the [[25th National Geographic Bee|2013 National Geographic Bee]], Trebek announced that 2013 would be his last year hosting the Finals. Newscaster [[Soledad O'Brien]] took his place the following year, moderating the bee in [[26th National Geographic Bee|2014]] and [[27th National Geographic Bee|2015]]. O'Brien was then replaced by [[Mo Rocca]] in [[28th National Geographic Bee|2016]] and Rocca has been moderating the Bee since then.\n\nThe current champion is Nihar Janga, from [[Canyon Ridge Middle School]] in [[Austin, Texas]]. He is the 31st Champion. In 2020, the Bee was cancelled due to the evolving health crisis, [[COVID-19]].\n==Procedure==\n\n===School competitions===\nThe competition begins at the [[Elementary school (United States)|elementary school]] and middle school levels (4th grade - 8th grade) and usually occurs in November, December, or January. This competition requires at least 6 people to enter. Private schools, public schools, and homeschooled students are allowed to enter. Typically, between five and six million students are entered each year (any number of competitors may enter this competition). The two major stages in this competition are called the preliminary and the final stages. Often, the preliminary competition is further split into preliminary rounds and a semi-final. In the event of a tie, a [[tiebreaker]] round is held at the end of the preliminary rounds.\n\nIn the preliminary rounds, competitors are divided into groups of twenty and each contestant is asked one question from each of the seven themed rounds.  Categories include:\n*[[Cultural geography|Cultural Geography]]\n*[[Economic geography|Economic Geography]]\n*[[Geography of the United States|Across-the-Country]], [[World (geography)|Around-the-World]]\n*[[Science]]\n* Geographic Comparisons\n*[[Physical geography|Physical Geography]]\n* Odd-Item-Out (a category where one contestant is given three choices, plus a description. The contestant must determine which of the three choices does not fit.)\nContestants are awarded 1 point per question. At the end of seven rounds, players with the top ten scores advance to the finals. In addition to the game, a player may ask for a repeat of a [[spelling]] during these rounds. However, they are restricted to only asking twice in duration of the entire geographic bee.\n\nQuite often there is a [[Tie (draw)|tie]], in which case a semi-final tiebreaker round is needed. For example, if six players finished the preliminary rounds with eight points and fifteen finished with seven points, the six who finished with eight points automatically advance to the final competition. The fifteen with seven points move into the semi-final round where the top four are determined to fill the remainder of the seats in the finals. This is done by asking every player the same question at the same time and giving each player twelve seconds to write down the answer. Each question is automatically repeated twice.  Everyone reveals their answer at the end of the twelve seconds and players are eliminated on a single-elimination basis.  If, using the above example of four open seats in the finals, there is a question where eight players are left in the semi-final round and three players get the question right, those three advance to the finals. The other five who got the question wrong will continue with the single-elimination procedure to determine which competitor will take the last open seat in the finals. A player cannot ask judges to spell or repeat words in the semi-final round.\n\nThe final competition consists of two parts: the final round and the championship round. Each of the ten finalists starts with a clean slate and is eliminated after two incorrect answers. This continues until the number of contestants drops from ten to two and a third-place finisher is determined. A player is not officially eliminated until the end of a series of questions, since if all but one competitor makes their second miss in that round, all the players stay in the competition. Again, a player may ask for a spelling or repeat on any question, but only once per question. Earlier in the round, questions may require oral answers or written answers from all the competitors at one time. Quite often, many of the earlier questions in this round contain visuals as part of the question, such as [[map]]s or pictures. Question examples in the past have included pictures of state quarters with the name rubbed off and maps of the US with national forests shown and numbered. Contestants, at the time, were given the name of the national forest and (he or she) must match states with trees. At the national level, competitions may include items such as [[flag]]s, [[musical instrument]]s, [[hat]]s, and even live animals. After a certain round, all questions must require oral answers only.\n\nIf there is a tie for the championship round or third place, there will be an elimination round. For example, if four players are left and three make their second mistake, the fourth advances to the championship round and the other three enter the tiebreaker. The moderator will then ask each of the three players, at the same time, to write their answers to the same question. In this special round, questions can be repeated by players but they cannot ask how to spell a given word. As a result, if one of three responses are correct, he or she will rise to the championship round and the other two will move to the tiebreaker round until a third-place winner determined.\n\nIn the championship round, both players start with a clean slate again. The moderator asks both contestants the same question at the same time, repeated twice, and both players have fifteen seconds to write their answer. Both players then show their answers and each player who wrote a correct answer receives one point. There are three questions in the championship round. The player with the most points at the end is the champion. If both players are tied at the end, the competition enters the championship tiebreaker round. The rules are the same as for the championship round, except that the last player to answer a question incorrectly is the runner-up.\n\nIn 2010, National Geographic partnered with mobile development company [[Concentric Sky]] to launch a series of official app-based study tools titled Geobee Challenge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/web/business/24893551-46/concentric-national-geographic-skipper-sky.csp<|title=Tech company aiming high|last=Buri McDonald|first= Sherri|date=June 15, 2010|website=The Register-Guard|access-date= May 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Qualifying Test '''\n\nThe Qualifying Test is the only part of the bee that is entirely written. Every school champion takes this test to see if he or she can qualify for the state bee. The test comprises 70 multiple choice questions, which must be completed in 60 minutes. The top 100 scorers in each state or territory advance to the state level competition. Beginning with the 2016 Bee, the Qualifying test is online, and no longer is administered on paper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patch.com/new-york/wantagh/wantagh-student-heading-states-national-geographic-bee|title= |last=Doyle|first=Heather|date=March 19, 2015|website=Patch|access-date=May 18, 2019}}\n</ref>\n\n===State and national competitions===\nThe winner of each school-level competition takes an online test, and the top 100 in each state or territory qualify for the State Bee. If there is a tie in the State Qualifying Test, all students in the tie get an invitation to the State Bee (i.e. there were 107 State Bee Qualifiers in the 2019 Michigan State Geographic Bee). The rules at the state level are same as that at the school level, except that there are eight preliminary rounds instead of seven and each player is limited to two repeats or spelling for all eight preliminary rounds. Players are also limited to two repeats or spellings in the final round if they qualify. All the state bees are held on the same date, at the same time (in early April or late March) at all locations. State bees originally occurred for the fifty states, five U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands), [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Department of Defense Dependent Schools]] (DoDDS), for a total of 57. In 1999, the state competitions for Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana Islands were merged into one state competition known as the Pacific Territories, bringing the number down to 55. In 2009, the Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands competitions were merged into a single competition known as the Atlantic Territories, and since then there have only been 54 state and territory competitions.  For completions that involve students spread out across wide areas, such as the competitions like the DoDDS and Pacific Territories competitions, there is no in person competition such as in other states.  Instead, after winning the school bee, school champions from around these territories take a series of online tests to determine the territory champion.  The third-place finisher from each state receives $100, the second-place finisher $300, and the winner $1000.  The 54 state champions receive an all-expense-paid trip to Washington, D.C., for the national competition.\n\nThe rules at the national level are the same as those at the state, except that there are ten preliminary rounds instead of eight. There was previously a video part of the preliminary competition where students submitted a video worth six points, but was replaced by a written \"GeoChallenge\" worth ten points. The championship round can also consist of five questions instead of three. The competition is held over four days, with the preliminary rounds on the first day and the final rounds on the third. The national finals are held in late May at [[National Geographic Society]] headquarters in Washington, D.C. and are hosted by [[Mo Rocca]]. The ten finalists are guaranteed $1000. The third-place finisher receives a $5,000 college scholarship, the second-place finisher receives a $10,000 college scholarship, and the National Champion receives a $25,000 college scholarship, as well as a lifetime membership in the [[National Geographic Society]]. From 2009 to 2015, the National Champion also won a trip to the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]]. In 2016, National Champion Rishi Nair won a trip to southeast [[Alaska]], including a stop at [[Glacier Bay National Park]]. This was because 2016 was the centenary of the [[National Park Service|U.S. National Park Service]]. 2017 National Champion, Pranay Varada, received a trip to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. The National Competition final round format is also different from state. Originally, it was the same format, but in 2012, National Geographic changed the format so that correct answers were worth points and competitors could earn extra points with bonus questions, with eliminations being every few rounds. In 2015, they changed the format once again. There are no longer bonus questions, and the first five rounds are USA based and worth one point for most questions. The fifth round is a \u201clightning round\u201d where you are asked three rapid fire questions. Then, four students with the lowest scores are eliminated, a tie being broken with a tiebreaker about estimation. The next four rounds are global and are all worth two points per question, and end again with another lightning round. After this, the top three are left. There are two \u201cGeoChallenges\u201d in the final competition, one worth three points in round 3, and for the top ten a 45-second oral response worth six points. The top two then compete in a normal championship round.  In 2019, however, due to the introduction of a new competition that is called the \u201cGeochallenge\u201d(which is about developing a collaborative team project to tackle a given issue) they once again changed the format of the Bee.  The Semi-Finals, which consists of the top 10 contestants, is held on one day.  There are eight rounds of oral and written questions, and the four lowest scores are eliminated after these eight rounds.  Afterwards, there is a \u201cGeochallenge\u201d worth ten points, and three contestants are eliminated to narrow the competition down to the final three.  The next day, the top three contestants compete in the finals.  They have a series of five oral rounds, and then they have a Geochallenge round and a mapmaker round.  Afterwards, the lowest scoring contestant is eliminated, and a normal championship round occurs to determine the champion.\n\n===List of Moderators===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! '''Moderator's name'''\n! '''Year(s) moderated'''\n! '''First National Champion'''\n! '''Last National Champion'''\n|-\n|Alex Trebek\n| [[1st National Geographic Bee|1989]]\u2013[[25th National Geographic Bee|2013]]\n| Jack Staddon\n| Sathwik Karnik\n|-\n| Soledad O'Brien\n| [[26th National Geographic Bee|2014]]\u2013[[27th National Geographic Bee|2015]]\n| Akhil Rekulapelli\n| Karan Menon\n|-\n| Mo Rocca\n| [[28th National Geographic Bee|2016]]\u2013present\n|Rishi Nair\n|N/A\n|}\n\n===International competition===\n{{main|National Geographic World Championship}}\nThere was an [[National Geographic World Championship|international competition]], which was also moderated by [[Alex Trebek]], but it was run differently. The top finishers from each country's national competition formed a team representing their country and participated in an [[Olympics|Olympic]]-style event which included a team written competition and a team oral competition. The 2013 competition was held in [[Saint Petersburg, Russia]]. The 2015 [[National Geographic World Championship]], originally planned to take place in [[Stockholm, Sweden]], was canceled, and the competition was since put on hiatus.\n\n===Criticism===\nSome argue that the selection process of the National Geographic GeoBee competition is not well designed to reliably promote the most qualified contestants, as it leaves significant room for chance. This is due to the small number of questions and the fact that each contestant answers different questions.<ref>http://www.nationalgeographic.org/bee/faq</ref> Particularly, during the preliminary rounds contestants are eliminated with a single mistake if there are more than 9 perfect scores.\nThe fact that a single mistake is not a reliable indicator for a contestant's overall strength was demonstrated during the [[26th National Geographic Bee|2014 National competition]]. The preliminary rounds resulted in 9 contestants with perfect score who accordingly became finalists. The 10th spot was filled by tie breaker rounds between contestants who made a single mistake during the preliminaries and went to the Virginia champion [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/140521-geography-bee-national-geographic-world-scholarship-students/ Akhil Rekulapelli], who then went on to win the finals. Again in 2019, Nihar Janga was involved in a tiebreaker to advance to the top 10, and he went on to win the entire competition.  Some also argue that the Geobee is becoming too focused on Geochallenge rounds instead of standard geography questions.  This was demonstrated in 2019, where more than half the total points in the semifinal and final rounds were based on these open ended \u201cGeochallenge\u201d questions.  Some also criticize the gender imbalance of the Geobee; only two girls have ever won the contest.\n\n==Champions==\n\n===National Champions===\nOf the thirty-one National Geographic GeoBee champions, twenty-nine have been male and two were female. Five are from the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], five are from [[Texas]], four are from the state of [[Michigan]], two are from [[Kansas]], two are from [[New Jersey]], two are from [[Florida]], and various other states have been home to one champion each.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
