The series follows [[Adrian Monk]] ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), a private detective with [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]] and multiple phobias, and his assistant [[Sharona Fleming]] ([[Bitty Schram]]). In this episode, Monk is obligated to fly with Sharona and is faced with a murder case on the airplane.\n\nThe episode was written by [[David M. Stern]] and directed by [[Rob Thompson (director)|Rob Thompson]]. It guest starred several actors, including [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]], [[Tim Daly]], and [[Garry Marshall]]. When the episode first aired in the United States on [[USA Network]] on October 18, 2002, it was watched by 4.2 million viewers. \"Mr. Monk and the Airplane\" was well received by critics, and earned Shalhoub a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in 2003.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Practical nurse]] [[Sharona Fleming]] ([[Bitty Schram]]) leaves to fly to [[New Jersey]] to visit her aunt. Her client and detective [[Adrian Monk]] ([[Tony Shalhoub]]) is forced to go with her, as he fears not being able to live without Sharona. While at [[San Francisco International Airport]], a woman named Barbara Chabrol ([[Jennifer Dale]]) stands on her toes to kiss her husband Stefan ([[Carl Marotte]]).\n\nAboard the plane, an annoying extension cord salesman named Warren Beach ([[Garry Marshall]]) does little to assuage Monk's fears. Monk quickly becomes suspicious of Stefan Chabrol after he notices that Barbara no longer needs to stand on her toes to kiss him, has \"forgotten\" that she ordered the vegetarian meal, knows nothing about air travel despite a frequent-flyer lapel, and claims to have \"forgotten how to\" speak [[French language|French]] when an old family friend, Bernard, meets them on board. More digging convinces Monk he is on to something. Monk quickly annoys everyone and a fellow passenger informs Stefan of Monk's suspicions.\n\nMeanwhile, Bernard appears dead, probably because of a heart attack but Monk cannot guarantee it. He steals Bernard's cup and, with a lighter borrowed from Beach, proceeds to burn away the wine to reveal a mysterious liquid at the bottom. However, the flight attendant, Leigh Harrison ([[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]]), is alerted to Monk's use of a lighter on board, and confiscates both the lighter and the glass, dumping the liquid down the sink.\n\nMonk calls [[Randy Disher|Lieutenant Disher]] and explains what he thinks happened. Stefan and his mistress murdered Barbara and the mistress disguised herself as Barbara. Stefan, being a pilot, then used his valid identification card and its virtually unlimited access to hide the body at a [[construction site]] at the airport. The construction workers poured concrete over the corpse, unwittingly destroying the evidence.\n\nWhen Monk and Sharona's flight lands at [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], Monk stalls Stefan's connecting flight to Paris by wittingly saying that the captain of the Paris flight is drunk. This allows Disher and the construction crew to excavate and find the body. The [[Newark Police Department]] shows up, and Stefan and his mistress are led away in handcuffs.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:TimDaly95.jpg|thumb|200px|Shalhoub's former ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'' co-star Tim Daily guest starred as himself]]\n\n\"Mr. Monk and the Airplane\" was written by [[David M.

The series follows [[Adrian Monk]] ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), a private detective with [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]] and multiple phobias, and his assistant [[Sharona Fleming]] ([[Bitty Schram]]). In this episode, Monk is obligated to fly with Sharona and is faced with a murder case on the airplane.\n\nThe episode was written by [[David M. Stern]] and directed by [[Rob Thompson (director)|Rob Thompson]]. It guest starred several actors, including [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]], [[Tim Daly]], and [[Garry Marshall]]. When the episode first aired in the United States on [[USA Network]] on October 18, 2002, it was watched by 4.2 million viewers. \"Mr. Monk and the Airplane\" was well received by critics, and earned Shalhoub a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in 2003.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Practical nurse]] [[Sharona Fleming]] ([[Bitty Schram]]) leaves to fly to [[New Jersey]] to visit her aunt. Her client and detective [[Adrian Monk]] ([[Tony Shalhoub]]) is forced to go with her, as he fears not being able to live without Sharona. While at [[San Francisco International Airport]], a woman named Barbara Chabrol ([[Jennifer Dale]]) stands on her toes to kiss her husband Stefan ([[Carl Marotte]]).\n\nAboard the plane, an annoying extension cord salesman named Warren Beach ([[Garry Marshall]]) does little to assuage Monk's fears. Monk quickly becomes suspicious of Stefan Chabrol after he notices that Barbara no longer needs to stand on her toes to kiss him, has \"forgotten\" that she ordered the vegetarian meal, knows nothing about air travel despite a frequent-flyer lapel, and claims to have \"forgotten how to\" speak [[French language|French]] when an old family friend, Bernard, meets them on board. More digging convinces Monk he is on to something. Monk quickly annoys everyone and a fellow passenger informs Stefan of Monk's suspicions.\n\nMeanwhile, Bernard appears dead, probably because of a heart attack but Monk cannot guarantee it. He steals Bernard's cup and, with a lighter borrowed from Beach, proceeds to burn away the wine to reveal a mysterious liquid at the bottom. However, the flight attendant, Leigh Harrison ([[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]]), is alerted to Monk's use of a lighter on board, and confiscates both the lighter and the glass, dumping the liquid down the sink.\n\nMonk calls [[Randy Disher|Lieutenant Disher]] and explains what he thinks happened. Stefan and his mistress murdered Barbara and the mistress disguised herself as Barbara. Stefan, being a pilot, then used his valid identification card and its virtually unlimited access to hide the body at a [[construction site]] at the airport. The construction workers poured concrete over the corpse, unwittingly destroying the evidence.\n\nWhen Monk and Sharona's flight lands at [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], Monk stalls Stefan's connecting flight to Paris by wittingly saying that the captain of the Paris flight is drunk. This allows Disher and the construction crew to excavate and find the body. The [[Newark Police Department]] shows up, and Stefan and his mistress are led away in handcuffs.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:TimDaly95.jpg|thumb|200px|Shalhoub's former ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'' co-star Tim Daily guest starred as himself]]\n\n\"Mr. Monk and the Airplane\" was written by [[David M.

The 100th overall, it originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on September 30, 2007. It was written by [[John Viener]] and directed by [[Cyndi Tang]]. In the episode, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] convinces [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] to move in with his girlfriend Jillian and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] tags along to help pay the rent. Meanwhile, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] and [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] get jobs at the convenience store where Chris befriends the manager, prompting Meg to do all the hard work. The episode title is a reference to the [[Billy Joel]] song \"[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)]]\" and the film ''[[Brian's Song]]''. This episode marks the end of Brian and Jillian's relationship, which started in [[Family Guy (season 5)|season five]].\n\n\"Movin' Out (Brian's Song)\" was met with generally positive reviews from critics, who praised it for having a continuous storyline. Critics also praised [[Drew Barrymore]]'s performance as Jillian and considered it sorrowful that her character was written out of the series. The episode was viewed by 7.95 million viewers in its original airing, according to [[Nielsen ratings]]. \"Movin' Out (Brian's Song)\" was released onto [[DVD]] along with five other episodes from the season on October 21, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Brian Griffin|Brian]] turns down a chance to see ''[[Disney on Ice]]'' with [[List of Family Guy Characters#Jillian|Jillian]], so she decides to give his ticket to [[Peter Griffin|Peter]]. Brian claims to be relieved, telling [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] he has been feeling smothered lately and needs to focus on his writing. After Peter and Jillian spend the entire day together and greatly enjoy each other's company, Peter convinces Jillian to either force Brian to let her move in with him or leave him. Brian is angry at Peter for doing this, as he feels it is too soon for them to have a committed relationship, but after Lois warns him that he is not being fair on Jillian, he agrees to get an apartment with her. Much to his surprise, Brian has a good time living with Jillian, but he comes to the realization that there is no way he can pay the rent by himself and he decides to allow [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] to move in with them, who now makes money with his own [[paperboy (newspaper delivery)|paper route]].\n\nWhen Brian does not tell Jillian that Stewie is helping with the rent, Stewie quickly gets in the way of Brian and Jillian's happiness living together. After arguing with Brian one night while he is having [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with Jillian, Stewie reveals that he is paying half the rent, prompting Brian to admit he never wanted to move in with Jillian at all. Heartbroken, Jillian leaves Brian, who blames Stewie for ruining the relationship until Stewie tells him it's himself that ruined the relationship. After many failed attempts to lift a saddened Brian's spirits, Stewie convinces Brian to try to get Jillian back. Brian goes to her apartment and asks her to take him back, only to find that she is on a date with [[Mayor West]], who comforted her following their argument and is now living with her. As the two go their separate ways, Brian moves back in with the Griffins, where he manages to move on with his life.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] is given a job at a local [[Convenience store#United States|convenience store]]. Meg is extremely happy with her job and she decides to help [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] get a job there, too. Chris immediately becomes friends with the store owner, Carl, and he is given a large [[Promotion (rank)|promotion]] which Carl originally promised to Meg. When Meg takes issue with this, she is fired. [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], to whom Meg has told of her plight, explains the situation to Chris and tells him to stand up for Meg by getting her job back. Chris is able to do this after bribing Carl by withholding his opinions of movies he and Carl normally discuss until Carl re-hires her. Meg, in turn, rejects working at the store again, as she only had Chris get her job back to see if he would stand up for her.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Drew Barrymore Berlin 2014.jpg|180px|thumb|\"Movin' Out (Brian's Song)\" was, at the time, [[Drew Barrymore]]'s final episode, ending \"the Jillian arc\".]]\n\"Movin' Out (Brian's Song)\" was written by series regular [[John Viener]] and directed by series regular [[Cyndi Tang]].

The 100th overall, it originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on September 30, 2007. It was written by [[John Viener]] and directed by [[Cyndi Tang]]. In the episode, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] convinces [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] to move in with his girlfriend Jillian and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] tags along to help pay the rent. Meanwhile, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] and [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] get jobs at the convenience store where Chris befriends the manager, prompting Meg to do all the hard work. The episode title is a reference to the [[Billy Joel]] song \"[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)]]\" and the film ''[[Brian's Song]]''. This episode marks the end of Brian and Jillian's relationship, which started in [[Family Guy (season 5)|season five]].\n\n\"Movin' Out (Brian's Song)\" was met with generally positive reviews from critics, who praised it for having a continuous storyline. Critics also praised [[Drew Barrymore]]'s performance as Jillian and considered it sorrowful that her character was written out of the series. The episode was viewed by 7.95 million viewers in its original airing, according to [[Nielsen ratings]]. \"Movin' Out (Brian's Song)\" was released onto [[DVD]] along with five other episodes from the season on October 21, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Brian Griffin|Brian]] turns down a chance to see ''[[Disney on Ice]]'' with [[List of Family Guy Characters#Jillian|Jillian]], so she decides to give his ticket to [[Peter Griffin|Peter]]. Brian claims to be relieved, telling [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] he has been feeling smothered lately and needs to focus on his writing. After Peter and Jillian spend the entire day together and greatly enjoy each other's company, Peter convinces Jillian to either force Brian to let her move in with him or leave him. Brian is angry at Peter for doing this, as he feels it is too soon for them to have a committed relationship, but after Lois warns him that he is not being fair on Jillian, he agrees to get an apartment with her. Much to his surprise, Brian has a good time living with Jillian, but he comes to the realization that there is no way he can pay the rent by himself and he decides to allow [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] to move in with them, who now makes money with his own [[paperboy (newspaper delivery)|paper route]].\n\nWhen Brian does not tell Jillian that Stewie is helping with the rent, Stewie quickly gets in the way of Brian and Jillian's happiness living together. After arguing with Brian one night while he is having [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with Jillian, Stewie reveals that he is paying half the rent, prompting Brian to admit he never wanted to move in with Jillian at all. Heartbroken, Jillian leaves Brian, who blames Stewie for ruining the relationship until Stewie tells him it's himself that ruined the relationship. After many failed attempts to lift a saddened Brian's spirits, Stewie convinces Brian to try to get Jillian back. Brian goes to her apartment and asks her to take him back, only to find that she is on a date with [[Mayor West]], who comforted her following their argument and is now living with her. As the two go their separate ways, Brian moves back in with the Griffins, where he manages to move on with his life.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] is given a job at a local [[Convenience store#United States|convenience store]]. Meg is extremely happy with her job and she decides to help [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] get a job there, too. Chris immediately becomes friends with the store owner, Carl, and he is given a large [[Promotion (rank)|promotion]] which Carl originally promised to Meg. When Meg takes issue with this, she is fired. [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], to whom Meg has told of her plight, explains the situation to Chris and tells him to stand up for Meg by getting her job back. Chris is able to do this after bribing Carl by withholding his opinions of movies he and Carl normally discuss until Carl re-hires her. Meg, in turn, rejects working at the store again, as she only had Chris get her job back to see if he would stand up for her.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Drew Barrymore Berlin 2014.jpg|180px|thumb|\"Movin' Out (Brian's Song)\" was, at the time, [[Drew Barrymore]]'s final episode, ending \"the Jillian arc\".]]\n\"Movin' Out (Brian's Song)\" was written by series regular [[John Viener]] and directed by series regular [[Cyndi Tang]].

Written by Julian Jones and directed by [[James Hawes]], the episode was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 20 September 2008.\n\nThe episode tells the arrival of [[Merlin (Merlin character)|Merlin]] ([[Colin Morgan]]) as a young man in [[Camelot]], where magic is banned by King [[Uther Pendragon (Merlin character)|Uther Pendragon]] ([[Anthony Head]]). Taken under the wing of Camelot's physician, Gaius ([[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]]), he is warned that he must keep his innate magical ability a secret. In Camelot, he meets Uther's heir, the arrogant Prince [[List of Merlin characters#Arthur Pendragon|Arthur]] ([[Bradley James]]), as well as Lady [[Morgana (Merlin character)|Morgana]] ([[Katie McGrath]]) and her handmaid, [[List of Merlin characters#Queen Guinevere \"Gwen\" Pendragon|Guinevere]] ([[Angel Coulby]]). As a witch ([[Eve Myles]]) plans revenge on the King's heir for the execution of her son, Merlin is informed by a cryptic [[The Great Dragon (Merlin)|dragon]] ([[John Hurt]]) that his destiny is to protect Arthur.\n\n''Merlin'' was conceived by Julian Murphy and Johnny Capps to be an origin story for the characters of the Arthurian legends, with family-centered entertainment. Young actors with little experience were cast as the four lead characters, while better-known actors were cast in supporting roles. Many of the scenes in Camelot were filmed in France, at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]], while the rest was filmed in England and Wales. Special effects were done by [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]], who had the task of creating the talking dragon. \"The Dragon's Call\" was watched by 7.15 million viewers in the UK and 6.3 million in the US on [[NBC]]. Critical reception was mixed, with some feeling the show had promise but lacked imagination, and the actual plot of \"The Dragon's Call\" was deemed slight.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Merlin (Merlin character)|Merlin]] ([[Colin Morgan]]), a young sorcerer, arrives in [[Camelot]] just in time to witness the execution of Thomas Collins, a man accused of sorcery, by the order of King [[Uther Pendragon (Merlin character)|Uther Pendragon]] ([[Anthony Head]]), who has banned the practice of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] in his kingdom on pain of death. As soon as the man is beheaded, Uther declares to the watching crowd that he shall throw a festival to celebrate twenty years since he wiped out magic and magicians from the kingdom. When he finishes his announcements, a hideous old hag, Thomas' mother Mary ([[Eve Myles]]), swears revenge for the murder of her son, \"a son for a son!\", before vanishing to avoid arrest. The King's ward, [[Morgana (Merlin character)|Morgana]] ([[Katie McGrath]]), warns that Uther may be making enemies through his hatred and radical methods of wiping out magic.\n\nMerlin reports to Camelot's physician Gaius ([[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]]) and saves the old man's life when he falls from a balcony by magically moving a mattress to cushion his fall. Though initially denying his abilities, Merlin later admits that he has had magical powers since birth, which Gaius warns him to keep secret. Reading a letter from Merlin's mother, Gaius realises that the boy was sent to Camelot for protection. Meanwhile, in the forest outside Camelot, Mary kills Lady Helen (Myles), a singer who is to perform at Uther's court, with a [[poppet]]. Mary assumes Helen's appearance using an enchantment, though her true hideous appearance can still be seen in her reflection (like in mirrors or water).\n\nOutside, Merlin stands up for a servant who is being bullied by his master, but as the master turns out to be the King's spoiled son, [[List of Merlin characters#Arthur Pendragon|Arthur]] ([[Bradley James]]), Merlin is imprisoned. For the second night in a row, he hears a voice calling his name. Gaius frees him the next morning, though Merlin has to spend time in the [[stocks]]. There he meets Morgana's handmaiden [[List of Merlin characters#Queen Guinevere \"Gwen\" Pendragon|Guinevere]] or \"Gwen\" ([[Angel Coulby]]), who commends him for being brave. Merlin confronts Arthur after being released, who tricks him into a fight with [[mace (bludgeon)|maces]]. Merlin keeps Arthur away using magic, which is met with ridicule by Gaius. Hearing the same voice calling his name that night, Merlin follows it to a cave where a dragon ([[John Hurt]]) informs him that he is destined to protect Arthur with his powers.\n\nGaius instructs Merlin to deliver elixirs to Morgana and Lady Helen; in the latter's room he finds the poppet, but bluffs his way out of discovery. Later, Helen kills a handmaiden who glimpses her true form in a mirror. At the feast, Mary sings an enchantment as Lady Helen, causing all the guests to fall asleep. Merlin, realising what is going on, covers his ears. Mary attempts to kill Arthur, but Merlin drops a chandelier on her with magic before she releases the dagger. As she has stopped singing, the enchantment is lifted and her true appearance is revealed. In a last effort she throws the dagger at Arthur, but Merlin slows time to pull him out of the way. Mary dies from her injuries, having failed in her attempt to avenge her son. Uther rewards Merlin by making him Arthur's servant, though neither boy is thrilled with the idea. The next day, Gaius gives Merlin a book on magic, under condition that he keep it hidden.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Conception and development===\n''Merlin'' was conceived by [[Shine Limited|Shine Television]] producers Julian Murphy and Johnny Capps, who had worked together on ''[[Hex (TV series)|Hex]]'', a fantasy series produced by Shine for [[Sky One]].<ref name=\"cues up ads\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/29/bbc.television|title=Merlin: BBC cues up TV and cinema ads|first=Mark|last=Sweeney|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 August 2008|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> The two had enjoyed presenting a \"high-concept\" show, and wished to do more.<ref name=\"times article\">{{cite web|first=Garry|last=Jenkins|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4779531.ece|title=The BBC turns from Doctor Who to Merlin as knights draw in|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615123644/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4779531.ece|archivedate=15 June 2011|work=[[The Times]]|date=20 September 2008|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> The [[BBC]] had been interested in broadcasting a drama based on the character of Merlin for some time; a little over a year before the Shine series was initiated, writer and producer [[Chris Chibnall]] had been developing a project aimed at a BBC One Sunday night slot, which was ultimately not commissioned.<ref name=\"magic touch\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/dec/07/broadcasting.bbc|title=BBC1 seeks magic touch for Merlin drama|first=Jason|last=Deans|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 December 2006|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> The programme was intended for family entertainment and designed to appeal to a wide audience.<ref name=\"magic touch\"/><ref name=\"bbcjuly\"/>\n\nAs the Arthurian legends do not reflect genuine historical events, not being set in any one singular period in time, the show's creators were more interested in conveying a world that felt \"real\".<ref name=\"behind the magic\"/> Not constrained by  historical accuracy, they had many opportunities to build the world in which they set their series; for example, tomatoes were included despite being absent from Europe in the Medieval era, and there was never a dragon in the earliest texts involving Merlin.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The series was intended to have an \"epic scale\" that would have a wide \"cross-generational\" appeal; films such as ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' were cited as inspiration.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Despite this, the creators strived to have smaller moments that the audience could relate to and comedy to lighten the darker tone.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> A fairy-tale aspect was also incorporated - highlighted in \"The Dragon's Call\" with the singing and cobwebs - to set the programme apart from others. ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was an inspiration in this respect.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> ''Merlin'' was also influenced by the US show ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', about the early years of [[Superman]]; Murphy and Capps said that ''Smallville'' helped provide the idea of a \"Camelot that existed before its golden age\".<ref name=\"cues up ads\" /> The creators wanted to show Merlin, Arthur, Gwen and Morgana in their youth, \"before they were famous\".<ref name=\"behind the magic\">{{cite video|people=[[James Hawes|Hawes, James]]; [[Anthony Head]]; [[Colin Morgan]]; Julian Murphy|date=2009|title=Behind the Magic|medium=DVD|publisher=BBC|location=''Merlin: The Complete Series One'' Disc 1}}</ref> Murphy and Capps intended for the four young characters and situations to be relatable to young viewers.<ref name=\"behind the magic\"/> They also put the characters in unusual positions with respect to their later, well-known roles to make the audience wonder how they would reach those roles; for example, Guinevere, the future Queen of Camelot and wife of Arthur, is a servant with a romantic interest in Merlin.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Looking back at \"The Dragon's Call\", Murphy and Capps felt that it had so much to introduce in terms of world and characters that there was not enough of the main plot of the episode.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:EveMyles.JPG|thumb|left|\"The Dragon's Call\" guest-starred Eve Myles, who enjoyed playing the villain.]]\nThe producers were aware that they would be casting young actors with little experience in film and television.<ref name=\"behind the magic\"/> Hundreds were seen for the part of Merlin, with the part going to 22-year-old [[Colin Morgan]],<ref name=\"cues up ads\"/> whom Murphy and Capps felt possessed a broad acting range with good comedic timing and wonder, and who they felt would most importantly be likable to the audience.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> [[Bradley James]] was cast as Prince Arthur, whom the producers saw as a \"medieval [[Prince Harry]]\". They felt that James' sense of comedy balanced the fact that the character was intended to first appear acting like an \"idiot\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Murphy and Capps had previously worked with James on a pilot, and kept him in the \"back of [their] minds\" when casting Arthur.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> [[Katie McGrath]] and [[Angel Coulby]], who play Morgana and Gwen respectively, also had little previous professional acting experience.<ref name=\"behind the magic\"/> Despite this, it was noted that all four young actors took to their jobs maturely and with energy.<ref name=\"behind the magic\"/>\n\nThe series also incorporates more experienced and well-known actors. [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]] was cast as Gaius, who was conceived to have a dysfunctional father/son relationship with Merlin. Murphy and Capps had worked with Wilson before and considered him a broad actor with a \"warmth\" and \"humanity\" that would fit the character.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The voice of the Great Dragon was given to [[John Hurt]]; he was offered the part, though the producers did not expect him to accept.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The role of King Uther went to veteran actor [[Anthony Head]], who was best known for his role as [[Rupert Giles]] in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. Head had been one of the first choices for the part; Murphy and Capps felt that he was good with \"high-concept\" worlds.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Murphy and Capps had also previously worked with [[Caroline Faber]], who briefly appears as Merlin's mother. The two liked her sense of humanity, though her scene&nbsp;\u2014 where Gaius reads her letter&nbsp;\u2014 was almost cut from \"The Dragon's Call\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> [[Eve Myles]] guest stars in \"The Dragon's Call\" as the villain Mary Collins and her host body Lady Helen. Murphy and Capps remarked that Myles gave a \"big\" but \"truthful\" performance, and really \"embraced\" being a villain.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Myles sang during the filming of the climax, though her voice was replaced with a real operatic soprano in post-production.

Written by Julian Jones and directed by [[James Hawes]], the episode was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 20 September 2008.\n\nThe episode tells the arrival of [[Merlin (Merlin character)|Merlin]] ([[Colin Morgan]]) as a young man in [[Camelot]], where magic is banned by King [[Uther Pendragon (Merlin character)|Uther Pendragon]] ([[Anthony Head]]). Taken under the wing of Camelot's physician, Gaius ([[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]]), he is warned that he must keep his innate magical ability a secret. In Camelot, he meets Uther's heir, the arrogant Prince [[List of Merlin characters#Arthur Pendragon|Arthur]] ([[Bradley James]]), as well as Lady [[Morgana (Merlin character)|Morgana]] ([[Katie McGrath]]) and her handmaid, [[List of Merlin characters#Queen Guinevere \"Gwen\" Pendragon|Guinevere]] ([[Angel Coulby]]). As a witch ([[Eve Myles]]) plans revenge on the King's heir for the execution of her son, Merlin is informed by a cryptic [[The Great Dragon (Merlin)|dragon]] ([[John Hurt]]) that his destiny is to protect Arthur.\n\n''Merlin'' was conceived by Julian Murphy and Johnny Capps to be an origin story for the characters of the Arthurian legends, with family-centered entertainment. Young actors with little experience were cast as the four lead characters, while better-known actors were cast in supporting roles. Many of the scenes in Camelot were filmed in France, at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]], while the rest was filmed in England and Wales. Special effects were done by [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]], who had the task of creating the talking dragon. \"The Dragon's Call\" was watched by 7.15 million viewers in the UK and 6.3 million in the US on [[NBC]]. Critical reception was mixed, with some feeling the show had promise but lacked imagination, and the actual plot of \"The Dragon's Call\" was deemed slight.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Merlin (Merlin character)|Merlin]] ([[Colin Morgan]]), a young sorcerer, arrives in [[Camelot]] just in time to witness the execution of Thomas Collins, a man accused of sorcery, by the order of King [[Uther Pendragon (Merlin character)|Uther Pendragon]] ([[Anthony Head]]), who has banned the practice of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] in his kingdom on pain of death. As soon as the man is beheaded, Uther declares to the watching crowd that he shall throw a festival to celebrate twenty years since he wiped out magic and magicians from the kingdom. When he finishes his announcements, a hideous old hag, Thomas' mother Mary ([[Eve Myles]]), swears revenge for the murder of her son, \"a son for a son!\", before vanishing to avoid arrest. The King's ward, [[Morgana (Merlin character)|Morgana]] ([[Katie McGrath]]), warns that Uther may be making enemies through his hatred and radical methods of wiping out magic.\n\nMerlin reports to Camelot's physician Gaius ([[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]]) and saves the old man's life when he falls from a balcony by magically moving a mattress to cushion his fall. Though initially denying his abilities, Merlin later admits that he has had magical powers since birth, which Gaius warns him to keep secret. Reading a letter from Merlin's mother, Gaius realises that the boy was sent to Camelot for protection. Meanwhile, in the forest outside Camelot, Mary kills Lady Helen (Myles), a singer who is to perform at Uther's court, with a [[poppet]]. Mary assumes Helen's appearance using an enchantment, though her true hideous appearance can still be seen in her reflection (like in mirrors or water).\n\nOutside, Merlin stands up for a servant who is being bullied by his master, but as the master turns out to be the King's spoiled son, [[List of Merlin characters#Arthur Pendragon|Arthur]] ([[Bradley James]]), Merlin is imprisoned. For the second night in a row, he hears a voice calling his name. Gaius frees him the next morning, though Merlin has to spend time in the [[stocks]]. There he meets Morgana's handmaiden [[List of Merlin characters#Queen Guinevere \"Gwen\" Pendragon|Guinevere]] or \"Gwen\" ([[Angel Coulby]]), who commends him for being brave. Merlin confronts Arthur after being released, who tricks him into a fight with [[mace (bludgeon)|maces]]. Merlin keeps Arthur away using magic, which is met with ridicule by Gaius. Hearing the same voice calling his name that night, Merlin follows it to a cave where a dragon ([[John Hurt]]) informs him that he is destined to protect Arthur with his powers.\n\nGaius instructs Merlin to deliver elixirs to Morgana and Lady Helen; in the latter's room he finds the poppet, but bluffs his way out of discovery. Later, Helen kills a handmaiden who glimpses her true form in a mirror. At the feast, Mary sings an enchantment as Lady Helen, causing all the guests to fall asleep. Merlin, realising what is going on, covers his ears. Mary attempts to kill Arthur, but Merlin drops a chandelier on her with magic before she releases the dagger. As she has stopped singing, the enchantment is lifted and her true appearance is revealed. In a last effort she throws the dagger at Arthur, but Merlin slows time to pull him out of the way. Mary dies from her injuries, having failed in her attempt to avenge her son. Uther rewards Merlin by making him Arthur's servant, though neither boy is thrilled with the idea. The next day, Gaius gives Merlin a book on magic, under condition that he keep it hidden.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Conception and development===\n''Merlin'' was conceived by [[Shine Limited|Shine Television]] producers Julian Murphy and Johnny Capps, who had worked together on ''[[Hex (TV series)|Hex]]'', a fantasy series produced by Shine for [[Sky One]].<ref name=\"cues up ads\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/29/bbc.television|title=Merlin: BBC cues up TV and cinema ads|first=Mark|last=Sweeney|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 August 2008|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> The two had enjoyed presenting a \"high-concept\" show, and wished to do more.<ref name=\"times article\">{{cite web|first=Garry|last=Jenkins|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4779531.ece|title=The BBC turns from Doctor Who to Merlin as knights draw in|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615123644/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4779531.ece|archivedate=15 June 2011|work=[[The Times]]|date=20 September 2008|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> The [[BBC]] had been interested in broadcasting a drama based on the character of Merlin for some time; a little over a year before the Shine series was initiated, writer and producer [[Chris Chibnall]] had been developing a project aimed at a BBC One Sunday night slot, which was ultimately not commissioned.<ref name=\"magic touch\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/dec/07/broadcasting.bbc|title=BBC1 seeks magic touch for Merlin drama|first=Jason|last=Deans|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 December 2006|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> The programme was intended for family entertainment and designed to appeal to a wide audience.<ref name=\"magic touch\"/><ref name=\"bbcjuly\"/>\n\nAs the Arthurian legends do not reflect genuine historical events, not being set in any one singular period in time, the show's creators were more interested in conveying a world that felt \"real\".<ref name=\"behind the magic\"/> Not constrained by  historical accuracy, they had many opportunities to build the world in which they set their series; for example, tomatoes were included despite being absent from Europe in the Medieval era, and there was never a dragon in the earliest texts involving Merlin.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The series was intended to have an \"epic scale\" that would have a wide \"cross-generational\" appeal; films such as ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' were cited as inspiration.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Despite this, the creators strived to have smaller moments that the audience could relate to and comedy to lighten the darker tone.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> A fairy-tale aspect was also incorporated - highlighted in \"The Dragon's Call\" with the singing and cobwebs - to set the programme apart from others. ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was an inspiration in this respect.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> ''Merlin'' was also influenced by the US show ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', about the early years of [[Superman]]; Murphy and Capps said that ''Smallville'' helped provide the idea of a \"Camelot that existed before its golden age\".<ref name=\"cues up ads\" /> The creators wanted to show Merlin, Arthur, Gwen and Morgana in their youth, \"before they were famous\".<ref name=\"behind the magic\">{{cite video|people=[[James Hawes|Hawes, James]]; [[Anthony Head]]; [[Colin Morgan]]; Julian Murphy|date=2009|title=Behind the Magic|medium=DVD|publisher=BBC|location=''Merlin: The Complete Series One'' Disc 1}}</ref> Murphy and Capps intended for the four young characters and situations to be relatable to young viewers.<ref name=\"behind the magic\"/> They also put the characters in unusual positions with respect to their later, well-known roles to make the audience wonder how they would reach those roles; for example, Guinevere, the future Queen of Camelot and wife of Arthur, is a servant with a romantic interest in Merlin.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Looking back at \"The Dragon's Call\", Murphy and Capps felt that it had so much to introduce in terms of world and characters that there was not enough of the main plot of the episode.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:EveMyles.JPG|thumb|left|\"The Dragon's Call\" guest-starred Eve Myles, who enjoyed playing the villain.]]\nThe producers were aware that they would be casting young actors with little experience in film and television.<ref name=\"behind the magic\"/> Hundreds were seen for the part of Merlin, with the part going to 22-year-old [[Colin Morgan]],<ref name=\"cues up ads\"/> whom Murphy and Capps felt possessed a broad acting range with good comedic timing and wonder, and who they felt would most importantly be likable to the audience.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> [[Bradley James]] was cast as Prince Arthur, whom the producers saw as a \"medieval [[Prince Harry]]\". They felt that James' sense of comedy balanced the fact that the character was intended to first appear acting like an \"idiot\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Murphy and Capps had previously worked with James on a pilot, and kept him in the \"back of [their] minds\" when casting Arthur.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> [[Katie McGrath]] and [[Angel Coulby]], who play Morgana and Gwen respectively, also had little previous professional acting experience.<ref name=\"behind the magic\"/> Despite this, it was noted that all four young actors took to their jobs maturely and with energy.<ref name=\"behind the magic\"/>\n\nThe series also incorporates more experienced and well-known actors. [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]] was cast as Gaius, who was conceived to have a dysfunctional father/son relationship with Merlin. Murphy and Capps had worked with Wilson before and considered him a broad actor with a \"warmth\" and \"humanity\" that would fit the character.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The voice of the Great Dragon was given to [[John Hurt]]; he was offered the part, though the producers did not expect him to accept.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The role of King Uther went to veteran actor [[Anthony Head]], who was best known for his role as [[Rupert Giles]] in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. Head had been one of the first choices for the part; Murphy and Capps felt that he was good with \"high-concept\" worlds.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Murphy and Capps had also previously worked with [[Caroline Faber]], who briefly appears as Merlin's mother. The two liked her sense of humanity, though her scene&nbsp;\u2014 where Gaius reads her letter&nbsp;\u2014 was almost cut from \"The Dragon's Call\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> [[Eve Myles]] guest stars in \"The Dragon's Call\" as the villain Mary Collins and her host body Lady Helen. Murphy and Capps remarked that Myles gave a \"big\" but \"truthful\" performance, and really \"embraced\" being a villain.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Myles sang during the filming of the climax, though her voice was replaced with a real operatic soprano in post-production.

Meanwhile, [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) talks smack to [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) after [[Darryl Philbin]] ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) beats [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) in a game of ping pong, prompting Jim to spend the entire day practicing in the conference room.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter his girlfriend [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) sues her former employer [[Dunder Mifflin]] for [[wrongful dismissal|wrongful termination]], [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) finds himself forced by Jan to be a witness against his employer.

[[Toby Flenderson]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) comes along as the HR representative, against Michael's protests. The [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] goes well for Jan at first, as she claims that she was terminated due to discrimination over her [[breast augmentation]]. To counter evidence that she had a romantic relationship with Michael before they disclosed it to corporate, Jan submits Michael's personal [[diary]], which she brought to the deposition without his knowledge or permission. Michael is further incensed against Jan when he learns that she gave him a scathing performance review after they had begun dating, claiming that he is unfit for his current position and should be demoted to sales. Michael learns he was never a contender when interviewing for Jan's former position at the corporate office, with the CFO insisting repeatedly that he is a nice guy, but ultimately unsuited for the position. Michael defends the company anyway, and later states that \"you expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.\" Jan and Michael drive home, clearly angry at each other over the events of the day. \n[[Image:Thedeposition2.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]] and [[List of characters from The Office (US T.V. series)#Mose Schrute|Mose]] playing [[ping-pong]]]]\nBack at the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of Dunder Mifflin, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) repeatedly loses to warehouse foreman [[Darryl Philbin]] ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) at [[ping pong]], prompting Darryl's girlfriend [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) to gloat to Jim's girlfriend [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) over her boyfriend's superior skills.

Throughout the day, Jim practices against his coworkers, eventually discovering [[Dwight Schrute]]'s ([[Rainn Wilson]]) prowess at the game. When Jim and Darryl have a rematch, Jim again loses to Darryl. Fed up with Kelly's continued taunting, Pam challenges her to a game of ping pong, but the two play poorly. Jim and Darryl quickly bore of watching them and decide to play ping pong in the conference room.

Written by consulting producer [[Lester Lewis]] and directed by [[Julian Farino]], the episode originally aired in the United States on November 15, 2007 on [[NBC]]. \"The Deposition\" was the last original episode of the show to air before the show went on hiatus due to the [[2007 Writers Guild of America strike]].<ref name=\"strike\">{{cite news|url=http://tvdecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/early-victim-of-strike-office-originals-end-next-week\n|title=Early Victim of Strike: \u2018Office\u2019 Originals End Next Week\n|author=Brian Stelter\n|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]\n|date=November 7, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) and [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) travel to New York City for the deposition of Jan's lawsuit against the company.

Meanwhile, [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) talks smack to [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) after [[Darryl Philbin]] ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) beats [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) in a game of ping pong, prompting Jim to spend the entire day practicing in the conference room.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter his girlfriend [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) sues her former employer [[Dunder Mifflin]] for [[wrongful dismissal|wrongful termination]], [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) finds himself forced by Jan to be a witness against his employer.

[[Toby Flenderson]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) comes along as the HR representative, against Michael's protests. The [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] goes well for Jan at first, as she claims that she was terminated due to discrimination over her [[breast augmentation]]. To counter evidence that she had a romantic relationship with Michael before they disclosed it to corporate, Jan submits Michael's personal [[diary]], which she brought to the deposition without his knowledge or permission. Michael is further incensed against Jan when he learns that she gave him a scathing performance review after they had begun dating, claiming that he is unfit for his current position and should be demoted to sales. Michael learns he was never a contender when interviewing for Jan's former position at the corporate office, with the CFO insisting repeatedly that he is a nice guy, but ultimately unsuited for the position. Michael defends the company anyway, and later states that \"you expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.\" Jan and Michael drive home, clearly angry at each other over the events of the day. \n[[Image:Thedeposition2.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]] and [[List of characters from The Office (US T.V. series)#Mose Schrute|Mose]] playing [[ping-pong]]]]\nBack at the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of Dunder Mifflin, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) repeatedly loses to warehouse foreman [[Darryl Philbin]] ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) at [[ping pong]], prompting Darryl's girlfriend [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) to gloat to Jim's girlfriend [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) over her boyfriend's superior skills. Unable to tolerate Kelly\u2019s [[trash-talk]], Pam builds a makeshift ping pong table in the conference room for Jim to practice against other office employees.  Throughout the day, Jim practices against his coworkers, eventually discovering [[Dwight Schrute]]'s ([[Rainn Wilson]]) prowess at the game. When Jim and Darryl have a rematch, Jim again loses to Darryl. Fed up with Kelly's continued taunting, Pam challenges her to a game of ping pong, but the two play poorly. Jim and Darryl quickly bore of watching them and decide to play ping pong in the conference room. The episode concludes with Dwight playing a high-intensity game of ping pong against his cousin [[List of characters from The Office (US T.V. series)#Mose Schrute|Mose Schrute]] ([[Michael Schur]]), with the two at an apparent stalemate.\n\n==Production==\n\"The Deposition\" was the first episode of ''The Office'' to be written by [[Lester Lewis]].

As with many [[galliform]] species, the female (the hen) is smaller and much less colorful than the male (the tom). With wingspans of 1.5&ndash;1.8 meters (almost 6 feet), the turkeys are the largest birds in the open forests in which they live and are rarely mistaken for any other species. Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. They are [[game (food)|game]] and are sometimes hunted for food. In all Connecticut species, males are polygamous and have elaborate courtship displays. These heavily built birds have legs feathered to the toes.

It first aired on October 5, 2006 on [[NBC]] in the United States.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) becomes unimpressed with how [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) is controlling his branch, so [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) tries to take his job and an office power play ensues. Meanwhile, [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) conducts a lunchtime fashion show, and the [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branch plays ''[[Call of Duty]]'' as a team-building exercise, something [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) does not do well in.\n\nThe episode was written by co-executive producer [[Paul Lieberstein]] and directed by executive producer [[Greg Daniels]]. Several cast members noted that the episode contained [[Shakespeare]]an elements, such as [[Angela Martin]]'s similarities with the ''[[Macbeth]]'' character [[Lady Macbeth]]. According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was viewed by 4.1% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast.

[[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) prods [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) to ask Jan to give him Michael's job. After her awkward meeting with Dwight, where he declares he can be a better boss than Michael, Jan calls Michael and demands he get his branch under control.\n\nThe [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branch plays ''[[Call of Duty]]'' under the guise of a team-building exercise. New to the game, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) plays poorly and draws the ire of his teammates. As he leaves for home, Jim pretends to toss a grenade at [[Karen Filippelli]] ([[Rashida Jones]]), who responds by creating a pretend explosion with paper clips. Karen longingly watches Jim leave.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) decides to revamp her wardrobe after her separation from [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy Anderson]] and ordered some new clothes. When Pam's clothes are shipped to the office, [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) insists that Pam perform a lunchtime fashion show to show off a new blouse.

It first aired on October 5, 2006 on [[NBC]] in the United States.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) becomes unimpressed with how [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) is controlling his branch, so [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) tries to take his job and an office power play ensues. Meanwhile, [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) conducts a lunchtime fashion show, and the [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branch plays ''[[Call of Duty]]'' as a team-building exercise, something [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) does not do well in. \n\nThe episode was written by co-executive producer [[Paul Lieberstein]] and directed by executive producer [[Greg Daniels]]. Several cast members noted that the episode contained [[Shakespeare]]an elements, such as [[Angela Martin]]'s similarities with the ''[[Macbeth]]'' character [[Lady Macbeth]]. According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was viewed by 4.1% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. Critical reception was largely mixed, with several reviewers criticizing Jim's Stamford storyline.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) berates [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) when she discovers that he calls the entire office into the conference room every Monday to watch a movie. [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) prods [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) to ask Jan to give him Michael's job. After her awkward meeting with Dwight, where he declares he can be a better boss than Michael, Jan calls Michael and demands he get his branch under control.\n\nThe [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branch plays ''[[Call of Duty]]'' under the guise of a team-building exercise. New to the game, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) plays poorly and draws the ire of his teammates. As he leaves for home, Jim pretends to toss a grenade at [[Karen Filippelli]] ([[Rashida Jones]]), who responds by creating a pretend explosion with paper clips. Karen longingly watches Jim leave.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) decides to revamp her wardrobe after her separation from [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy Anderson]] and ordered some new clothes. When Pam's clothes are shipped to the office, [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) insists that Pam perform a lunchtime fashion show to show off a new blouse. When it draws unwanted attention, Pam concludes that it is too revealing.\n\nMichael leads Dwight to believe that he has been given control of the branch before revealing the ruse. Dwight begs for his job and for Michael's forgiveness while Angela and the rest of the office watch. Dwight offers to do Michael's laundry for a year. When it appears that Michael is on the verge of firing Dwight, Michael insists that they \"hug it out, bitch.\" Dwight quickly returns to being Michael's loyal right-hand man, but Michael is still resentful, and forces Dwight to stand atop a box in the middle of the office, wearing a sign that says \"LIAR\"\u2014and then promise to do Michael's laundry for a year.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Lady Macbeth Cattermole.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Angela Martin|Angela]]'s storyline in this episode has been compared to [[Lady Macbeth]]'s ''(pictured)'' in the play ''[[Macbeth]]''.]]\n\"The Coup\" was written by co-executive producer [[Paul Lieberstein]], who plays series regular [[Toby Flenderson]], and was directed by executive producer and series creator [[Greg Daniels]].<ref name=episode>{{cite episode |title=The Coup |series=The Office |serieslink=The Office (American TV series) |credits=[[Roger Nygard]] (director), [[Jennifer Celotta]] (writer) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=October 5, 2006 |season=3 |number=3}}</ref> Several cast members believed the episode contains [[Shakespeare]]an themes, in particular elements of the ''[[Macbeth]]'' character [[Lady Macbeth]] in Angela's storyline.<ref name=commentary>{{cite video |people=[[John Krasinski|Krasinski, John]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[Rashida Jones]], [[Angela Kinsey]] |date=2007 |title=Audio commentary for \"The Coup\" | medium=DVD |publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] |location=''The Office: Season Three'' Disc 1 }}</ref> Lady Macbeth was depicted as an ambitious woman who \"exerted an evil influence over her husband,\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KswuBEV2JV4C&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=%22lady+macbeth%22+ambitious&source=bl&ots=B9LXVCKXZ_&sig=dSO_Dx2AvjbqXpbZTdUuK80WLgQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EqoEULW3JImnrQHwytS5CA&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=%22lady%20macbeth%22%20ambitious&f=false |title=Dictionary of Shakespeare |first=Louise |last=McConnell |year=2000 |page=176 |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers |ISBN=157958215X}}</ref> characteristics that fit with Angela attempting to push her lover, Dwight, into power.<ref name=episode/><ref name=commentary/> In her weekly blog for ''[[TV Guide]]'', actress [[Kate Flannery]] previewed the episode, \"Behind every great man is a pushy woman.
