Thara Ak-Var's name is a reference to [[Flamebird#Ak-Var|Ak-Var]], who was the second [[pre-Crisis]] Flamebird, and his wife, Thara.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Silver Age===\nIn the [[silver age of comic books|Silver Age]], Thara was the wife of Ak-Var, lab assistant to the Kandorian scientist Van-Zee, who was also Thara's uncle. At one point, Van-Zee donned the Nightwing costume in order to rescue a captured Superman. After Superman and Jimmy's departure from Kandor, Van-Zee took up the role of Nightwing full-time. Ak-Var later assumed the mantle of Flamebird. The two shared several distinct adventures, once teaming up with Superman and Jimmy.\n\n===Modern Age===\nThara Ak-Var lived in [[Argo City]] and was a childhood friend of [[Kara Zor-El]]. While Kara's parents were members of the Science Guild, Thara's parents were both of the Military Guild and had served under [[General Zod]].\n\nThara was among the few survivors of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]\u2019s destruction. [[Zor-El]] created a force field around all of Argo City to protect it using technology found after [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]\u2019s capture of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]]. Sensing his own technology being used, Brainiac tracked down Argo City and began to integrate it with Kandor, and killing those who tried to stop him, including Thara's parents. While Zor-El and [[Alura (DC Comics)|Alura]] managed to assist their daughter in escaping, everyone else in Argo City was captured by Brainiac, including Thara.\n\nLife in the shrunken city continued, though at a slower rate than the rest of the universe. Despite her young age and inexperience in actual combat, Thara was made chief of security for Kandor. She was adamant that no one think she did not earn her position.<ref name=\"sm681\">''Superman'' (vol. 1) #681 (October 2008)</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Thara was approached by Kandor's religious guild, who conducted a ceremony that granted Thara a vision of the Flamebird, a mythical Kryptonian creature. The religious guild, believing Thara to be the living avatar of the Flamebird, took her into their ranks. One day Thara felt her mind connect with that of [[Chris Kent (comics)|Chris Kent's]], who himself seemed to have some kind of connection to the Nightwing, the Flamebird's partner deity. Reclaiming her position as chief of Security, Thara used a protective suit invented by Zor-El to enter the [[Phantom Zone]], free Chris, and bring him to Kandor in secret.<ref>''Action Comics Annual'' (vol. 1) #12 (August 2009)</ref>\n\nWhen Superman discovered Kandor in Brainiac's ship, the imprisoned Kryptonians were all freed. Thara was reunited with her friend, Kara.\n\n====New Krypton====\nWhen the Kryptonians agreed to meet with the President of the United States in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], it was Thara who trained Zor-El and Alura's escorts.<ref name=\"sm681\"/> She also organized the evacuation of the area when [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] attacked the Kryptonian delegation. After Kara's father, Zor-El, was murdered by Reactron in Kandor,<ref name=\"ac872\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #872 (February 2009)</ref> Alura came to blame Thara for her husband's death, as security within the city was her responsibility.\n\nThara Ak-Var began operating on Earth as the superhero [[Flamebird]], aided by Chris as [[Nightwing]]. Both heroes work from the [[Fortress of Solitude]] where they initially stood guard over the Phantom Zone projector to stop Kryptonian soldiers from releasing Zod.\n\n====A World Without Superman====\nAfter all Kryptonians except for Superman are restricted from coming to Earth, Thara and Chris Kent remained behind in their guises of Flamebird and Nightwing. To further hide their Kryptonian origins, the duo began wearing powersuit versions of their costumes. The young heroes are tracking down Kryptonian sleeper agents operating on Earth by order of General Zod. Chris discovered the identities of these agents while his parents kept him prisoner in the Phantom Zone.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #875 (May 2009)</ref>\n\nWhen Zod became aware of Flamebird and Nightwing's actions against his agents he sent [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] to Earth to stop them. After a brutal attack by Ursa, Thara left gravely wounded by a frangible [[Kryptonite]] knife, and Chris was forced to bring her to [[Lois Lane]] for medical assistance.<ref name=\"ac876\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #876 (June 2009)</ref> She was saved by the efforts of the [[JLA (comics)|JLA]] heroine, [[Doctor Light]] who used her powers to accelerate her sun absorption.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #877 (July 2009)</ref> Thara recovered, and joined Chris in an attempt to bring in a violent sleeper couple. Their battle was interrupted by a group of meta-human adversaries led by [[Codename: Assassin]].<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #878 (August 2009)</ref> During the fight, the sleepers escaped, pursued by Chris. Codename: Assassin's forces managed to pin Thara, and he used his psychic abilities to read her mind, learning about Chris and the sleepers. When Assassin threatened Chris's life, Thara's body erupted into flames, and she screamed \"Get out of our mind!\" in Kryptonian. Thara went on to defeat her attackers, but left them alive, stating \"We are not vengeful. But we will fight to protect what is ours, what we love. You are warned.\"<ref name=ac879>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #879 (September 2009)</ref> After battling the sleeper couple, Chris and Thara become celebrity superheroes with an adoring public. Thara was uncomfortable with the female attention Chris got, especially after discovering a fan's phone number stuffed into Chris's armor. Thara denied feelings of jealousy, but Chris responded by kissing her. The two were then attacked by the Kryptonian sleeper couple. They chased them into the subway, only to find that it was really [[Metallo]] and Reactron in disguise. Thara and Chris were then swiftly defeated and captured.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #880 (October 2009)</ref>\n\nHowever, Chris and Thara are teleported away, along with [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. Supergirl attacks Thara, for killing her father and trying to kill her. However, Chris stops her and tells her he is her cousin. The three are attacked by Guardian and the Science Police, for apparently killing Mon-El. Chris tries to tell Guardian that they did not murder Mon-El, but Guardian ignores him. The three manage to escape to Paris. Chris, Thara and Kara talk about what has happened. They then discover that the two sleepers they were fighting were Metallo and Reactron. However, they are attacked by Squad K.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #881 (November 2009)</ref>\n\nEscaping from Squad K, the three go to [[Lana Lang]]'s apartment. They decide to get Lois's help in clearing their names. Chris and Lana go to find Lois while Kara and Thara stay in Lana's apartment.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #45 (November 2009)</ref>\n\nOnce more while being left alone the two girls argue over their perceived betrayals of another, with Supergirl blaming Thara for her father's death and Thara being angry due to Kara not believing her about the Flamebird entity. After a brief argument the two along with Chris are once more forced to flee. During the attempt to flee they once more encounter Squad K however the three opt to surrender in order to clear their names. While they manage to persuade the Squad K commander, Reactron quickly murders his team-mates and attempts to kill the three.\n\nDuring their conflict Thara is injured while attempting to protect Supergirl. As Reactron is about to kill Chris and Kara, Thara manifests her Flamebird powers and personality in which she easily overpowers and defeats Reactron. The Flamebird decides to kill Reactron but is swayed to show mercy after Reactron reveals that Mon-El is alive and is talked down by Supergirl. The Flamebird is once more submerged after sharing a kiss with Chris. Following their battle Thara and Kara make up, deciding to renew their friendship.<ref name=sg46>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #46 (December 2009)</ref>\n\nDonning new costumes, Thara and Chris continue to protect the world, making sure to conceal their Kryptonian status. Thara shows slight jealousy over Chris getting fangirl attention, and in the ensuing argument, shares another kiss. On their return to their apartment, however, Chris undergoes another aging spurt becoming an old man. Under Kimiyo Hoshi's direction, Thara takes Chris to the renowned Dr. Pillings, who, unbeknownst to anyone, is actually the Kryptonian sleeper agent [[Jax-Ur]].<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #883 (January 2010)</ref> \"Pillings\" intentionally subjects Chris to a treatment that causes him extreme pain, causing enough emotional stress in Thara for the Flamebird to become dominant again. Realizing who the doctor really is, the Flamebird is forced into an unspecified agreement with Jax-Ur, after which he ensures Chris/the Nightwing's survival.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #884 (February 2010)</ref>\n\n====Superman: War of the Supermen====\nIn the 2010 mini-series ''[[Superman: War of the Supermen]]'', as Zod and the New Kryptonians prepare to attack earth, General Lane, working with Lex Luthor, finds a way to turn Reactron into a living bomb that destroys all of New Krypton. At the same time, Lane and Luthor use elements from the Rao construct to turn the sun red, which depowers the Kryptonians, many of whom die in space. Flamebird realizes that the only way to save the surviving Kryptonians is to unleash her power in the heart of the sun. It is implied by the dialogue that this act is Thara's final destiny, and the artwork shows her skeletal remains.<ref>''Superman: War of the Supermen'' #3 (July 2010)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThara has all the standard abilities of a Kryptonian exposed to the light of a yellow sun: super strength, super speed, invulnerability, flight, heat vision, super-breath, x-ray vision, and super hearing. She also possesses an undefined connection to the mythic \"Flamebird\" entity, which gives her the ability to create flame, and gives her a psychic link to Chris Kent. This connection to the Flamebird seems to be symbiotic in nature, as Thara recently referred to herself as \"we\" when attacking the warriors who threatened Chris.<ref name=ac879 />\n\nThe \"Flamebird\" entity further displays an immunity to gold kryptonite (if this immunity extends to other kryptonite forms remains to be seen) and is able to restore Thara to full health even after she was injured by Reactron. Furthermore, the \"Flamebird\" seems to be, like Thara, attracted to Chris Kent.<ref name=sg46 />\n\nLike all Kryptonians, Thara is weakened by Kryptonite radiation and fatally vulnerable to prolonged exposure.<ref name=\"ac876\"/>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\nThara Ak-Var appears in [[The CW]]\u2019s live-action [[Arrowverse]] series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', portrayed by [[Esm\u00e9 Bianco]].

The evangelization of the [[Vicariate Apostolic of Oriental Oceania]] (consisting of the prefectures apostolic of [[Tahiti]], the [[Marquesas]], and the Sandwich Islands) was entrusted to the [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary|Picpus Fathers]], then recently established by [[Pierre Coudrin]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13308a.htm | title=New Advent article on the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary| accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> The Vicariate Apostolic of Occidental Oceania was likewise entrusted to the Society of Mary, [[Marianists]] and [[Marists]], founded in 1836 at [[Lyon, France|Lyon]] by [[Jean-Claude-Marie Colin]].<ref>{{cite web| url=\nhttp://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11769a.htm | title=New Advent article on Jean-Claude-Marie Colin| accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the disappearance at sea of the Vicar Apostolic of Oriental Oceania, Msgr. Rouchouze, and a company of missionaries on the ''Marie Joseph'' in 1843, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] canonically erected from its territories the Vicariate Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands.<ref>{{cite web| url=\nhttp://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13438a.htm | title=New Advent article on the Vicariate Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands| accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> Similar vicariates apostolic were created for Tahiti and the Marquesas. [[Pope Pius IX|Blessed Pius IX]] changed its name in 1848 to the Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. [[Pope Pius XII|Venerable Pope Pius XII]] elevated the [[apostolic vicariate|vicariate apostolic]] to the dignity of a diocese on January 25, 1941, as it remains today.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dhono.html | title=Catholic Hierarchy Profile of the Diocese of Honolulu| accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===Missionaries===\n[[Image:Le bon pere Coudrin.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pierre Coudrin founded the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary which brought the Catholic Church to Hawai{{okina}}i.]]\nThe first Catholic mission to the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]] was established by the creation of the [[Prefecture Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands]] by [[Pope Leo XII]] and the appointment of [[Alexis Bachelot]] as its first and only prefect, a member of the [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary]], a [[religious institute]] called the Picpus Fathers, founded by [[Peter Coudrin|Pierre Coudrin]] during the [[French Revolution]]. The first Picpus Fathers departed from [[Bordeaux]] aboard the ''La Com\u00e8te'' on November 21, 1826, and stopped in [[Valpara\u00edso]] in [[Chile]] on February 8, 1827. The Picpus Fathers resumed their trip on February 25. They entered port at [[Honolulu Harbor]] on July 7. Having originally been refused entry by [[Protestant]] advisors to the king, the Picpus Fathers did not disembark from their ship until July 9, the Feast of [[Our Lady of Peace]]. Among the first Picpus Fathers were [[Abraham Armand]] and Alexis Bachelot of [[France]], as well as [[Patrick Short]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. They were joined by six lay brothers. It has been claimed that Fathers Armand, Bachelot and Short concelebrated the first [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] in the Hawaiian Islands on [[Bastille Day]], July 14, 1827, in honor of their religious institute's French heritage, but this is untrue, and an anachronism: concelebration of masses was not practiced at the time, and since France was being ruled by the restored Bourbon monarchy, \"Bastille Day\" would certainly not be marked as a national holiday. They performed the first baptism on November 30.\n\nThe Picpus Fathers were quick to plunge into the Hawaiian society. They learned the local language, went into the [[Native Hawaiians|Native Hawaiian]] community and began preaching to them. They distributed [[Hawaiian language]] [[Bible]]s and taught the lessons of [[Jesus]] from the [[gospel]]s. Hundreds of Native Hawaiians chose to receive the [[sacrament]]s of [[baptism]], [[confirmation]] and [[Eucharist]]. Among the first converts were William Pitt [[Kalanimoku]] who was baptized aboard the French vessel L'Uranie by Abbe de Quelen which arrived in 1819, four months after the death of [[Kamehameha the Great]]. Also the royal governors of [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], [[Boki (Hawaiian chief)|Boki]] and [[Liliha]]. They would both become pivotal members of the Catholic underground.\n\n===Persecution===\n{{multiple image\n| footer = Woodcuts showing the persecution of Catholics in Hawaii, c. 1839. Juliana Makuwahine was lashed onto a tree for her belief and Kimeone was bound in chains until [[Cyrille Pierre Th\u00e9odore Laplace|Captain Laplace]] released him.\n| align = right\n| image1 = Catholic Persecution in Hawaii, Juliana Makuwahine.jpg\n| width1 = 160\n| alt1 = \n| image2 = Catholic Persecution in Hawaii, Kimeone.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n}}\n[[Christians|Christian]] [[missionary|missionaries]] were influential in shaping the modern society of the kingdom after the deaths of [[Kamehameha I]] and [[Kamehameha II]]. The missionaries, largely [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]] from [[New England]], baptized the [[queen regent]] [[Kaahumanu|Ka{{okina}}ahumanu]] and persuaded her to create religious policy favoring the suppression of the Catholic Church in Hawai{{okina}}i. [[Kamehameha III]] agreed and enacted its expulsion from the kingdom. Fathers Bachelot and Short were forcibly boarded onto the brig ''Waverly'' by the chiefs loyal to Ka{{okina}}ahumanu and they left Honolulu Harbor on December 24, 1831. They landed off the coast of California and worked in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|California Missions]] near the present-day [[Los Angeles, California|City of Los Angeles]].\n\nNative Hawaiian converts of the Catholic Church claimed to have been imprisoned, beaten and tortured after the physical expulsion of their missionary priests. The persecution was prescribed, according to the [[Bishop Museum]], by the [[Protestant]] ministers claiming that such treatment was ordained by [[God]]. [[John Downes (naval officer)|Commodore John Downes]] of the [[United States Navy]] [[frigate]] {{USS|Potomac|1822|6}} expressed American disappointment of the king's decision resulting in the brief end of physical harm for the converts.\n\nIn 1835, both the vicar apostolic (Rouchouze) and prefect apostolic (Bachelot) working from Valpara\u00edso dispatched [[Columba Murphy]], a religious brother from [[Ireland]] affiliated with the Picpus Fathers, to evaluate the situation in the Hawaiian Islands. While other Picpus Fathers were denied entry into the kingdom, the king permitted Murphy to disembark from his ship due to his investigative role and the fact that Murphy, a mere brother, could not minister the sacraments. On September 30, 1836, [[Arsenius Walsh]], a Picpus Father, arrived in Honolulu to continue Murphy's work. Murphy had left earlier to report back to his superiors. The royal government refused Walsh's entry. However, the captain of the [[French Navy]] [[ship]] ''La Bonite'' persuaded the king to allow Walsh to stay. The royal government agreed to permit the Picpus Fathers to work freely in the Hawaiian Islands as long as they only attended to foreign Catholics, not Native Hawaiians.\n\nOn April 17, 1837, Fathers Bachelot and Short returned to Honolulu thinking the deal made with Father Walsh would apply to them. On April 30, the royal government forced them back onto their ship. The American and British [[Consul]]s compelled the king to allow Bachelot and Short to disembark. As a result, the captains of [[Royal Navy|British Navy]] and French Navy [[Ship|vessels]] escorted Bachelot and Short into Honolulu. Short would leave the Hawaiian Islands again in October.\n\n[[France]], which claimed to be a defender of the Catholic Church, dispatched the French Navy frigate ''Artemise'' which sailed into [[Honolulu Harbor]] on July 10, 1839. [[Cyrille Pierre Th\u00e9odore Laplace|Captain Cyrille Pierre Th\u00e9odore Laplace]] was ordered by his government to:\n\n{{cquote|''Destroy the malevolent impression which you find established to the detriment of the French name; to rectify the erroneous opinion which has been created as to the power of France; and to make it well understood that it would be to the advantage of the chiefs of those islands of the Ocean to conduct themselves in such a manner as not to incur the wrath of France. You will exact, if necessary with all the force that is yours to use, complete reparation for the wrongs which have been committed, and you will not quit those places until you have left in all minds a solid and lasting impression.''}}\n\nFearing an assault on his kingdom for the religious persecution, Kamehameha III issued the [[Edict of Toleration]] on June 17, 1839.<ref>{{cite web| url=\nhttp://www.britannica.com/eb/article-79296/Hawaii | title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica article on Hawaii| accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> A major disappointment for the Protestant ministers, Catholics became free to worship in the kingdom with the proclamation:\n\n{{cquote|''That the Catholic worship be declared free, throughout all the dominions subject to the king of the Sandwich Islands; the members of this religious faith shall enjoy in them the privileges granted to Protestants.''}}\n\nAs an act of reconciliation, Kamehameha III donated land to the Catholic Church in Hawai{{okina}}i for the construction of their first permanent church.\n\n===Foundation===\n[[Image:Rouchouze Episcopal Crest.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Bishop Etienne Jerome Rouchouze was the Vicar Apostolic of Oriental Oceania that included the Hawaiian Islands. His coat of arms adorns a stained glass window in the cathedral.]]\nShortly after the Laplace incident and the issuance of the Edict of Toleration, [[Etienne Jerome Rouchouze|Msgr. Etienne Rouchouze]], Vicar Apostolic of Oriental Oceania, moved to Honolulu from Valpara\u00edso, Chile. The bishop disembarked from his ship at Honolulu Harbor in the company of three Picpus Fathers. One of them was the earlier exiled Louis D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Maigret. Their arrival officially signified the Catholic victory over persecution in the Hawaiian Islands and the beginning of a permanent Catholic Church in Hawai{{okina}}i.\n\nThe first permanent church broke ground on the [[Calendar of saints|memorial feast]] of Our Lady of Peace on July 9, 1840. Our Lady of Peace had been the patroness of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary since the turmoil of the French Revolution. Fathers Armand, Bachelot and Short had consecrated the Hawaiian Islands under the protection of Our Lady of Peace when they first arrived. During the groundbreaking Mass, 280 Native Hawaiian catechumens received baptism and confirmation. For the rest of the year, devotees harvested large blocks of coral off the southern coastline of O{{okina}}ahu to build what would become the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace.\n\nOn the various neighbor islands, Bishop Rouchouze commissioned the construction of other permanent churches to serve as parish missions. They also started building makeshift [[school]]s to teach in the Catholic traditions of [[academia]]. A [[printing press]] was brought into Honolulu for the production of Catholic literature including missals and hymnals written in the Hawaiian language.\n\nIn January 1842, an excited Bishop Rouchouze, pleased with the success of his work, decided to sail back to the Paris home of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in order to recruit more Picpus Fathers and religious brothers to serve in the growing Catholic Church in Hawai{{okina}}i. Tragically, Bishop Rouchouze was lost at sea during his voyage back to the Hawaiian Islands. His vicar general took charge of the Vicariate Apostolic of Oriental Oceania while a search party was dispatched. Years later, the search was officially ended and Bishop Rouchouze was declared deceased.\n\n==Bishops==\n===Vicar Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands===\n# [[Louis Desire Maigret]], [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary|SS.CC.]] (1847\u20131848)\n\n===Vicars Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands===\n# Louis Desire Maigret, SS.CC.

Created in 1833 by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] and governed from [[South America]], its territories included the [[Marquesas]] and [[Tahiti]]. After the disappearance of Bishop Rouchouze, the three prefectures were elevated into independent vicariates apostolic. Each would be led by their own bishops.\n\n===Maigret===\n\nThe Vicariate Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands was established and on July 11, 1847, [[Pope Pius IX|Blessed Pius IX]] appointed [[Louis Desir\u00e9 Maigret]] as the succeeding prelate to the late Msgr. Rouchouze. The new vicar apostolic was consecrated in Chile as the titular bishop of Arathia and quickly attended to the needs of the fledgling Catholic Church in Hawai{{okina}}i. The name of the see was changed in 1848 to the Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. Msgr. Maigret completed the construction of the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace. He also invited the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary to open proper Catholic schools. The priests and religious brothers of the [[Society of Mary (Marianists)|Society of Mary]] (Marianists) were invited to do the same. Msgr. Maigret died on June 11, 1882, and was buried in a [[crypt]] below the sanctuary of the cathedral he built and loved.\n\n===Koeckemann===\n\n[[Image:Koeckemann Episcopal Crest.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Bishop Herman Koeckemann was the second Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. His coat of arms and an image of Blessed Damien of Moloka{{okina}}i adorn the cathedral.]]\n[[Pope Leo XIII]] immediately elevated [[Herman Koeckemann|Bernard Hermann Koeckemann]], a Picpus Father from [[Germany]], as the second Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. He was consecrated as the [[titular bishop]] of [[Olba (ancient city)|Olba]]. During his episcopate, Msgr. Koeckemann saw a wave of new Catholics from the [[exponential growth|exponentially growing]] [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]] laborer population in the Hawaiian Islands. The Catholic Church in Hawai{{okina}}i embraced new parishioners from the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] among others. There were so many devout Portuguese members that churches often had to include Masses in which the sermon (for the rest of the Mass would have been in Latin) was delivered in the [[Portuguese language]].\n\nMsgr. Koeckemann also saw the rise of [[leprosy]] cases throughout the kingdom. He oversaw the work of Saint Damien of Moloka{{okina}}i and [[Mother Marianne Cope|Saint Marianne Cope]] as they served the ailing lepers residing in an isolated colony on the Makanalua peninsula on the island of [[Molokai|Moloka{{okina}}i]]. Both would have causes for canonization opened for them by their respective religious institutes.\n\nOn February 22, 1892, Msgr. Koeckemann died and was buried at the [[Honolulu Catholic Cemetery]].\n\n===Ropert===\n[[File:Ropert Episcopal Crest.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Bishop Gulstan Francis Ropert was the third Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. His coat of arms adorns the cathedral.]]\nIt took several months before Pope Leo XIII appointed someone to succeed Bishop Koeckemann. On June 3, 1892, the pope chose a Picpus Father from France, [[Gulstan Ropert|Gulstan Francis Ropert]] to become the third Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. He was consecrated as titular bishop of Panopolis. It was during his reign that the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi was embroiled in revolution. American businessmen plotted to overthrow the peaceably reigning Queen of Hawai\u02bbi. [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marines]] marched towards [[Iolani Palace|\u02bbIolani Palace]], a neighbor of the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, and arrested [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani]]. A [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|provisional government]] was proclaimed before a [[republic]] was established. Msgr. Ropert received pleas by his Native Hawaiian followers to defend Lili\u02bbuokalani, being tried by a [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|military court]] for [[treason]] against the newly created government. Unfortunately, there wasn't much Msgr. Ropert could do. He would become the sole bishop of a new [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawai\u02bbi]].\n\nMsgr. Ropert also was responsible for the spiritual needs of local families whose children were sent overseas to fight in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. He also consoled Filipinos whose families were lost in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. Later in his reign, the Hawaiian Islands became a territory of the United States becoming the first bishop of the [[Territory of Hawaii|Territory of Hawai\u02bbi]]. Msgr. Ropert died on January 4, 1903, and was buried in Honolulu Catholic Cemetery.\n\n===Boeynaems===\n[[Image:Boeynaems Crest Honolulu.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Bishop Libert Hubert John Louis Boeynaems was the fourth Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands and led during World War I. His coat of arms adorns the cathedral.]]\nAgain it would take several months before [[Pope Leo XIII]] appointed someone to succeed the episcopacy in the Hawaiian Islands. On April 8, 1903, the pope appointed a Picpus Father from [[Antwerp]] in [[Belgium]], [[Libert H. Boeynaems|Libert Hubert John Louis Boeynaems]] to become the fourth Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. He was consecrated titular bishop of Zeugma. During his reign, Msgr. Boeynaems observed many of his faithful being sent to fight in [[Europe]] during [[World War I]]. He also oversaw the increasing militarization of the Hawaiian Islands. The entire coastline of the island of O{{okina}}ahu was fortified and several United States military bases were established, including: [[Fort Shafter]], [[Pearl Harbor]] and [[Schofield Barracks]]. With the absence of an established [[Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services|military ordinariate]] in the United States, Msgr. Boeynaems ministered to Catholic service members. After a period of illness, Msgr. Boeynaems died on May 13, 1926, and was buried in Honolulu Catholic Cemetery.\n\n===Alencastre===\n\n[[Image:Alencastre Window.jpg|thumb|250px|Pope Pius XI installed Stephen Alencastre of Portugal as fifth Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. Alencastre was the first person raised in Hawai{{okina}}i to become ordinary of the Hawaiian Church.]]\nWhen Msgr. Boeynaems became ill, [[Pope Pius XI]] elevated the first person to have grown up in the Hawaiian Islands to become a vicar apostolic. The pope appointed [[Stephen Alencastre|Stephen Peter Alencastre]], a Picpus Father born in [[Portugal]] who was brought as an infant to the Hawaiian Islands with his family to live. Msgr. Alencastre was raised and educated in Hawai{{okina}}i, living on the various islands. He subsequently graduated from Saint Louis College and was accepted into the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts. He was ordained to the priesthood and educated in Europe by the Picpus Fathers, earning a doctorate in sacred theology. He was later appointed and consecrated as coadjutor vicar apostolic and [[titular bishop of Arabissus]] to assist the ailing Msgr. Boeynaems, suffering in [[hospital]]. Upon Msgr. Boeynaems' death, Msgr. Alencastre succeeded as the fifth and final Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. Seeing a need for new locally trained priests, Msgr. Alencastre established Saint Stephen's Seminary in Kalihi Valley, named after his personal patron saint. He also oversaw the renovation of the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, modernizing it in time for the centennial celebration of the Catholic Church in Hawai{{okina}}i in 1927. He died aboard a ship en route from Los Angeles on November 9, 1940.\n\n==Diocese==\nMsgr. Alencastre's premonition that the vicariate would be elevated to diocesan status was fulfilled earlier than expected. Upon his death, [[Pope Pius XII|Venerable Pius XII]] decided that the Hawaiian Islands no longer needed a missionary church. Rather, its flourishing Catholic community was mature enough to be administered as a fully independent body of its own. The pope canonically erected the new Diocese of Honolulu on January 25, 1941.\n\n===Sweeney===\n\n[[Image:Honolulu Catholic Cemetery Iron Cross.jpg|200px|thumb|left|An iron cross at the [[Honolulu Catholic Cemetery]] marks the burial site of the bishops of the Hawaiian Islands.]]\nAfter several months of consideration, the Pope looked outside of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary for a successor to the last vicar apostolic. Pope Pius XII appointed a diocesan priest of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, [[James Joseph Sweeney]] as the first Bishop of Honolulu on May 20, 1941; Msgr. Sweeney was subsequently ordained to the episcopate on July 25, 1941, in the Cathedral of Saint Mary of Assumption in [[San Francisco, California]].\n\nBishop Sweeney's first few months in episcopacy happened in the advent of a most tragic event in Hawai{{okina}}i. On December 7, Japanese imperial forces bombed Pearl Harbor and scraped metropolitan Honolulu. Thousands of military and civilians died. Explosions were heard around downtown Honolulu and near the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace. Bishop Sweeney shepherded the diocese throughout [[World War II]].\n\n[[Pope John XXIII|Blessed John XXIII]] opened the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, and Bishop Sweeney was a council father, one of many prelates from the United States to attend the sessions. Inspired by the reforms agreed upon in [[Rome]], he enacted major changes to the liturgy in the Diocese of Honolulu. One of his actions was to renovate the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in keeping with the newly promulgated Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy. Soon all parishes offered Mass primarily in the [[English language|vernacular]] in place of [[Latin language|Latin]] and altars were built facing the congregation instead of the sanctuary wall. Slowly, other languages were incorporated into the Mass including the Hawaiian language. Bishop Sweeney also invited the [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marist Fathers and Brothers]] to staff several parishes on the islands of O{{okina}}ahu and Kaua{{okina}}i.\n\nBishop Sweeney fell ill and could not perform his duties with full vigor. His request for an auxiliary bishop was granted. Years later, Msgr. Sweeney died on his birthday on June 19, 1968. He was buried in [[Colma, California|Colma]] near San Francisco, where he spent his early years as a priest.\n\n===Scanlan===\n\n[[Pope Paul VI]] appointed [[John Joseph Scanlan]], the diocese's auxiliary bishop and apostolic administrator as its second ordinary on March 6, 1968. A San Francisco archdiocesan priest from [[County Cork]] in [[Ireland]], Msgr. Scanlan witnessed the growth of a young state of Hawai{{okina}}i. He was maintained cordial relations with the Catholic [[Governor of Hawaii|Governor of Hawai{{okina}}i]], [[John A. Burns]] even when the Hawai{{okina}}i legislature passed a bill permitting abortion on demand and Governor Burns allowed the bill to become law without his signature. Scanlan was also remembered for his invitation of several religious institutes to establish themselves in the Hawaiian Islands. Among such groups were the [[Society of Jesus]], the [[Christian Brothers of Ireland]], the [[Religious of the Virgin Mary]], and the [[Dominican Sisters]] of [[Iloilo]]. The Jesuits primarily minister to the students of the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawai{{okina}}i at M\u0101noa]].\n\nIn 1977, Msgr. Scanlan served as the principal consecrator of Father Joseph Ferrario as auxiliary bishop. His age was beginning to affect his work. Feeling the pressures of being 75 years old, Msgr. Scanlan chose to retire on June 30, 1981. He died on January 31, 1997, at Nazareth House in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]], a [[retirement home]] for priests and religious. His funeral was held at the metropolitan Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption and later at the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Honolulu. Bishop Scanlan, a father of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, had the honor of being buried beside Bishop Maigret, a father of the First Vatican Ecumenical Council, in a crypt under the sanctuary of the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace.\n\n===Ferrario===\n[[File:2018 Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus - Honolulu 02.jpg|thumb|250px|Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus]]\n[[Pope John Paul II]] appointed the diocese's auxiliary bishop [[Joseph Anthony Ferrario]], a former Sulpican educator and diocesan priest, as the third Bishop of Honolulu on May 13, 1982.\n\n===DiLorenzo===\n\nUpon Msgr. Ferrario's announcement of his retirement, the Vatican had appointed [[Francis X. DiLorenzo|Msgr. Francis DiLorenzo]], auxiliary bishop of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] as [[Apostolic Administrator|Apostolic Administrator of Honolulu]]. Later, on November 29, 1994, Pope John Paul II, appointed Msgr. DiLorenzo as the fourth Bishop of Honolulu. The Vatican later appointed Msgr. DiLorenzo as ordinary of the See of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] upon the announcement of the retirement of Richmond bishop [[Walter Francis Sullivan]]. Msgr. DiLorenzo assumed leadership of the Diocese of Richmond upon installation on May 24, 2004.\n\nWith the departure of Msgr. DiLorenzo, the diocesan college of consultors in accordance with the [[Code of Canon Law]], on May 28, 2004, elected from their peers [[Thomas L. Gross|Father Thomas L. Gross]] as temporary diocesan administrator. He also served on the committee that screened candidates for the post of Bishop of Honolulu. On February 1, 2006, [[Marc R. Alexander|Father Marc R. Alexander]] became diocesan administrator.\n\n===Silva===\n[[File:Diocese of Honolulu.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Diocesan Pastoral Center]]\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]] appointed [[Clarence Richard Silva]], the first native-born person in the episcopacy of the Hawaiian Islands to become a Bishop of Honolulu on May 17, 2005. He also became the second person of Portuguese ancestry in the episcopate since the Msgr. Stephen Peter Alencastre, SS.CC. Formerly the Vicar General of the Diocese of Oakland, Silva was ordained to the episcopate and installed as bishop at the [[Neal S. Blaisdell Center]] [[Arena]] on July 21. Over 3,500 were in attendance, making it one of the largest events held by the Diocese of Honolulu in its history.\n\nThe principal consecrator was [[William Joseph Levada]], Archbishop of San Francisco and newly appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The ordination and installation ceremony was the last official ceremonial function as metropolitan bishop over the Province of San Francisco for Levada; other non-ceremonial functions would continue until his official departure from office. Also in attendance were [[Gabriel Montalvo Higuera]], [[Archbishop Apostolic Nuncio to the United States]], and [[Anthony Apuron]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Agana|Archbishop of Agana]] as well as personal friend Deacon Larry Sousa of Norman, Oklahoma. Although scheduled to attend the episcopal ordination, [[Roger Mahony]], Cardinal [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archbishop of Los Angeles]], was unable to be present due to unforeseen airplane problems at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\n==Special Anniversaries of Significance to the Diocese==\n[[Image:Statue of Malia O Ka Malu.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Our Lady of Peace, the diocesan patroness, is honored on July 9 and August 15.]]\n*January 23 \u2013 Memorial, Saint [[Marianne Cope]], religious (2005)\n*January 25 \u2013 Anniversary of the Canonical Erection by Pope Pius XII of the Catholic Diocese of Honolulu (1941)\n*May 10 \u2013 Memorial, [[Saint Damien of Molokai]], religious (1995)\n*May 17 \u2013 Anniversary of the Appointment of Clarence Richard Silva, Vicar General of the Diocese of Oakland, as Fifth Bishop of Honolulu (2005)\n*July 9 \u2013 Memorial, Blessed Virgin Mary under the Title, Queen of Peace\n*July 21 \u2013 Anniversary of the Ordination to the Episcopate and Installation of Clarence Richard Silva as Fifth Bishop of Honolulu (2005)\n*July 28 \u2013 Anniversary of Dedication of the Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus, Honolulu (1985)\n*August 15 \u2013 Anniversary of Dedication of the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady, Queen of Peace, Honolulu (1843)\n\n==Parishes==\nSee, [[List of parishes of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu]].\n\n==Saints and Blesseds==\nThough the Diocese of Honolulu may be small, a number of Catholics have found their way to holiness and these include:\n* [[Father Damien|Jozef de Veuster]] (Damian of Molokai) (1840\u20131889), Professed Priest of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (Picpus)\n* [[Marianne Cope|Barbara Cope]] (Marianne) (1838\u20131918), Professed Religious of the Franciscan Sisters of Syracuse \n* [[Joseph Dutton|Ira Barnes Dutton]] (Joseph) (1843\u20131931), Layperson of the Diocese of Honolulu; Member of the Secular Franciscans\n* [[Helio Koa'eloa]] (ca. 1815\u20131846), Married Layperson of the Diocese of Honolulu \n* [[Gulstan Ropert|Gulstan-Francois Ropert]] (1839\u20131903), Professed Priest of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (Picpus); Apostolic Vicar of the Hawaiian Islands; Titular Bishop of Panopolis \n* [[Ambrose K.

The evangelization of the [[Vicariate Apostolic of Oriental Oceania]] (consisting of the prefectures apostolic of [[Tahiti]], the [[Marquesas]], and the Sandwich Islands) was entrusted to the [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary|Picpus Fathers]], then recently established by [[Pierre Coudrin]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13308a.htm | title=New Advent article on the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary| accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> The Vicariate Apostolic of Occidental Oceania was likewise entrusted to the Society of Mary, [[Marianists]] and [[Marists]], founded in 1836 at [[Lyon, France|Lyon]] by [[Jean-Claude-Marie Colin]].<ref>{{cite web| url=\nhttp://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11769a.htm | title=New Advent article on Jean-Claude-Marie Colin| accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the disappearance at sea of the Vicar Apostolic of Oriental Oceania, Msgr. Rouchouze and a company of missionaries on the ''Marie Joseph'' in 1843, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] canonically erected from its territories the Vicariate Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands.<ref>{{cite web| url=\nhttp://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13438a.htm | title=New Advent article on the Vicariate Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands| accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> Similar vicariates apostolic were created for Tahiti and the Marquesas. [[Pope Pius IX|Blessed Pius IX]] changed its name in 1848 to the Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. [[Pope Pius XII|Venerable Pope Pius XII]] elevated the [[apostolic vicariate|vicariate apostolic]] to the dignity of a diocese on January 25, 1941, as it remains today.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dhono.html | title=Catholic Hierarchy Profile of the Diocese of Honolulu| accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===Missionaries===\n[[Image:Le bon pere Coudrin.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pierre Coudrin founded the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary which brought the Catholic Church to Hawai{{okina}}i.]]\nThe first Catholic mission to the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]] was established by the creation of the [[Prefecture Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands]] by [[Pope Leo XII]] and the appointment of [[Alexis Bachelot]] as its first and only prefect, a member of the [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary]], a [[religious institute]] called the Picpus Fathers, founded by [[Peter Coudrin|Pierre Coudrin]] during the [[French Revolution]]. The first Picpus Fathers departed from [[Bordeaux]] aboard the ''La Com\u00e8te'' on November 21, 1826, and stopped in [[Valpara\u00edso]] in [[Chile]] on February 8, 1827. The Picpus Fathers resumed their trip on February 25. They entered port at [[Honolulu Harbor]] on July 7. Having originally been refused entry by [[Protestant]] advisors to the king, the Picpus Fathers did not disembark from their ship until July 9, the Feast of [[Our Lady of Peace]]. Among the first Picpus Fathers were [[Abraham Armand]] and Alexis Bachelot of [[France]], as well as [[Patrick Short]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. They were joined by six lay brothers. It has been claimed that Fathers Armand, Bachelot and Short concelebrated the first [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] in the Hawaiian Islands on [[Bastille Day]], July 14, 1827, in honor of their religious institute's French heritage, but this is untrue, and an anachronism: concelebration of masses was not practiced at the time, and since France was being ruled by the restored Bourbon monarchy, \"Bastille Day\" would certainly not be marked as a national holiday. They performed the first baptism on November 30.\n\nThe Picpus Fathers were quick to plunge into the Hawaiian society. They learned the local language, went into the [[Native Hawaiians|Native Hawaiian]] community and began preaching to them. They distributed [[Hawaiian language]] [[Bible]]s and taught the lessons of [[Jesus]] from the [[gospel]]s. Hundreds of Native Hawaiians chose to receive the [[sacrament]]s of [[baptism]], [[confirmation]] and [[Eucharist]]. Among the first converts were William Pitt [[Kalanimoku]] who was baptized aboard the French vessel L'Uranie by Abbe de Quelen which arrived in 1819, four months after the death of [[Kamehameha the Great]]. Also the royal governors of [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], [[Boki (Hawaiian chief)|Boki]] and [[Liliha]]. They would both become pivotal members of the Catholic underground.\n\n===Persecution===\n{{multiple image\n| footer = Woodcuts showing the persecution of Catholics in Hawaii, c. 1839. Juliana Makuwahine was lashed onto a tree for her belief and Kimeone was bound in chains until [[Cyrille Pierre Th\u00e9odore Laplace|Captain Laplace]] released him.\n| align = right\n| image1 = Catholic Persecution in Hawaii, Juliana Makuwahine.jpg\n| width1 = 160\n| alt1 = \n| image2 = Catholic Persecution in Hawaii, Kimeone.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n}}\n[[Christians|Christian]] [[missionary|missionaries]] were influential in shaping the modern society of the kingdom after the deaths of [[Kamehameha I]] and [[Kamehameha II]]. The missionaries, largely [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]] from [[New England]], baptized the [[queen regent]] [[Kaahumanu|Ka{{okina}}ahumanu]] and persuaded her to create religious policy favoring the suppression of the Catholic Church in Hawai{{okina}}i. [[Kamehameha III]] agreed and enacted its expulsion from the kingdom. Fathers Bachelot and Short were forcibly boarded onto the brig ''Waverly'' by the chiefs loyal to Ka{{okina}}ahumanu and they left Honolulu Harbor on December 24, 1831. They landed off the coast of California and worked in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|California Missions]] near the present-day [[Los Angeles, California|City of Los Angeles]].\n\nNative Hawaiian converts of the Catholic Church claimed to have been imprisoned, beaten and tortured after the physical expulsion of their missionary priests. The persecution was prescribed, according to the [[Bishop Museum]], by the [[Protestant]] ministers claiming that such treatment was ordained by [[God]]. [[John Downes (naval officer)|Commodore John Downes]] of the [[United States Navy]] [[frigate]] {{USS|Potomac|1822|6}} expressed American disappointment of the king's decision resulting in the brief end of physical harm for the converts.\n\nIn 1835, both the vicar apostolic (Rouchouze) and prefect apostolic (Bachelot) working from Valpara\u00edso dispatched [[Columba Murphy]], a religious brother from [[Ireland]] affiliated with the Picpus Fathers, to evaluate the situation in the Hawaiian Islands. While other Picpus Fathers were denied entry into the kingdom, the king permitted Murphy to disembark from his ship due to his investigative role and the fact that Murphy, a mere brother, could not minister the sacraments. On September 30, 1836, [[Arsenius Walsh]], a Picpus Father, arrived in Honolulu to continue Murphy's work. Murphy had left earlier to report back to his superiors. The royal government refused Walsh's entry. However, the captain of the [[French Navy]] [[ship]] ''La Bonite'' persuaded the king to allow Walsh to stay. The royal government agreed to permit the Picpus Fathers to work freely in the Hawaiian Islands as long as they only attended to foreign Catholics, not Native Hawaiians.\n\nOn April 17, 1837, Fathers Bachelot and Short returned to Honolulu thinking the deal made with Father Walsh would apply to them. On April 30, the royal government forced them back onto their ship. The American and British [[Consul]]s compelled the king to allow Bachelot and Short to disembark. As a result, the captains of [[Royal Navy|British Navy]] and French Navy [[Ship|vessels]] escorted Bachelot and Short into Honolulu. Short would leave the Hawaiian Islands again in October.\n\n[[France]], which claimed to be a defender of the Catholic Church, dispatched the French Navy frigate ''Artemise'' which sailed into [[Honolulu Harbor]] on July 10, 1839. [[Cyrille Pierre Th\u00e9odore Laplace|Captain Cyrille Pierre Th\u00e9odore Laplace]] was ordered by his government to:\n\n{{cquote|''Destroy the malevolent impression which you find established to the detriment of the French name; to rectify the erroneous opinion which has been created as to the power of France; and to make it well understood that it would be to the advantage of the chiefs of those islands of the Ocean to conduct themselves in such a manner as not to incur the wrath of France. You will exact, if necessary with all the force that is yours to use, complete reparation for the wrongs which have been committed, and you will not quit those places until you have left in all minds a solid and lasting impression.''}}\n\nFearing an assault on his kingdom for the religious persecution, Kamehameha III issued the [[Edict of Toleration]] on June 17, 1839.<ref>{{cite web| url=\nhttp://www.britannica.com/eb/article-79296/Hawaii | title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica article on Hawaii| accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> A major disappointment for the Protestant ministers, Catholics became free to worship in the kingdom with the proclamation:\n\n{{cquote|''That the Catholic worship be declared free, throughout all the dominions subject to the king of the Sandwich Islands; the members of this religious faith shall enjoy in them the privileges granted to Protestants.''}}\n\nAs an act of reconciliation, Kamehameha III donated land to the Catholic Church in Hawai{{okina}}i for the construction of their first permanent church.\n\n===Foundation===\n[[Image:Rouchouze Episcopal Crest.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Bishop Etienne Jerome Rouchouze was the Vicar Apostolic of Oriental Oceania that included the Hawaiian Islands. His coat of arms adorns a stained glass window in the cathedral.]]\nShortly after the Laplace incident and the issuance of the Edict of Toleration, [[Etienne Jerome Rouchouze|Msgr. Etienne Rouchouze]], Vicar Apostolic of Oriental Oceania, moved to Honolulu from Valpara\u00edso, Chile. The bishop disembarked from his ship at Honolulu Harbor in the company of three Picpus Fathers. One of them was the earlier exiled Louis D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Maigret. Their arrival officially signified the Catholic victory over persecution in the Hawaiian Islands and the beginning of a permanent Catholic Church in Hawai{{okina}}i.\n\nThe first permanent church broke ground on the [[Calendar of saints|memorial feast]] of Our Lady of Peace on July 9, 1840. Our Lady of Peace had been the patroness of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary since the turmoil of the French Revolution. Fathers Armand, Bachelot and Short had consecrated the Hawaiian Islands under the protection of Our Lady of Peace when they first arrived. During the groundbreaking Mass, 280 Native Hawaiian catechumens received baptism and confirmation. For the rest of the year, devotees harvested large blocks of coral off the southern coastline of O{{okina}}ahu to build what would become the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace.\n\nOn the various neighbor islands, Bishop Rouchouze commissioned the construction of other permanent churches to serve as parish missions. They also started building makeshift [[school]]s to teach in the Catholic traditions of [[academia]]. A [[printing press]] was brought into Honolulu for the production of Catholic literature including missals and hymnals written in the Hawaiian language.\n\nIn January 1842, an excited Bishop Rouchouze, pleased with the success of his work, decided to sail back to the Paris home of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in order to recruit more Picpus Fathers and religious brothers to serve in the growing Catholic Church in Hawai{{okina}}i. Tragically, Bishop Rouchouze was lost at sea during his voyage back to the Hawaiian Islands. His vicar general took charge of the Vicariate Apostolic of Oriental Oceania while a search party was dispatched. Years later, the search was officially ended and Bishop Rouchouze was declared deceased.\n\n==Bishops==\n===Vicar Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands===\n# [[Louis Desire Maigret]], [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary|SS.CC.]] (1847\u20131848)\n\n===Vicars Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands===\n# Louis Desire Maigret, SS.CC.

Created in 1833 by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] and governed from [[South America]], its territories included the [[Marquesas]] and [[Tahiti]]. After the disappearance of Bishop Rouchouze, the three prefectures were elevated into independent vicariates apostolic. Each would be led by their own bishops.\n\n===Maigret===\n\nThe Vicariate Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands was established and on July 11, 1847, [[Pope Pius IX|Blessed Pius IX]] appointed [[Louis Desir\u00e9 Maigret]] as the succeeding prelate to the late Msgr. Rouchouze. The new vicar apostolic was consecrated in Chile as the titular bishop of Arathia and quickly attended to the needs of the fledgling Catholic Church in Hawai{{okina}}i. The name of the see was changed in 1848 to the Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. Msgr. Maigret completed the construction of the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace. He also invited the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary to open proper Catholic schools. The priests and religious brothers of the [[Society of Mary (Marianists)|Society of Mary]] (Marianists) were invited to do the same. Msgr. Maigret died on June 11, 1882, and was buried in a [[crypt]] below the sanctuary of the cathedral he built and loved.\n\n===Koeckemann===\n\n[[Image:Koeckemann Episcopal Crest.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Bishop Herman Koeckemann was the second Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. His coat of arms and an image of Blessed Damien of Moloka{{okina}}i adorn the cathedral.]]\n[[Pope Leo XIII]] immediately elevated [[Herman Koeckemann|Bernard Hermann Koeckemann]], a Picpus Father from [[Germany]], as the second Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. He was consecrated as the [[titular bishop]] of [[Olba (ancient city)|Olba]]. During his episcopate, Msgr. Koeckemann saw a wave of new Catholics from the [[exponential growth|exponentially growing]] [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]] laborer population in the Hawaiian Islands. The Catholic Church in Hawai{{okina}}i embraced new parishioners from the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] among others. There were so many devout Portuguese members that churches often had to include Masses in which the sermon (for the rest of the Mass would have been in Latin) was delivered in the [[Portuguese language]].\n\nMsgr. Koeckemann also saw the rise of [[leprosy]] cases throughout the kingdom. He oversaw the work of Saint Damien of Moloka{{okina}}i and [[Mother Marianne Cope|Saint Marianne Cope]] as they served the ailing lepers residing in an isolated colony on the Makanalua peninsula on the island of [[Molokai|Moloka{{okina}}i]]. Both would have causes for canonization opened for them by their respective religious institutes.\n\nOn February 22, 1892, Msgr. Koeckemann died and was buried at the [[Honolulu Catholic Cemetery]].\n\n===Ropert===\n[[File:Ropert Episcopal Crest.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Bishop Gulstan Francis Ropert was the third Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. His coat of arms adorns the cathedral.]]\nIt took several months before Pope Leo XIII appointed someone to succeed Bishop Koeckemann. On June 3, 1892, the pope chose a Picpus Father from France, [[Gulstan Ropert|Gulstan Francis Ropert]] to become the third Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. He was consecrated as titular bishop of Panopolis. It was during his reign that the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi was embroiled in revolution. American businessmen plotted to overthrow the peaceably reigning Queen of Hawai\u02bbi. [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marines]] marched towards [[Iolani Palace|\u02bbIolani Palace]], a neighbor of the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, and arrested [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani]]. A [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|provisional government]] was proclaimed before a [[republic]] was established. Msgr. Ropert received pleas by his Native Hawaiian followers to defend Lili\u02bbuokalani, being tried by a [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|military court]] for [[treason]] against the newly created government. Unfortunately, there wasn't much Msgr. Ropert could do. He would become the sole bishop of a new [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawai\u02bbi]].\n\nMsgr. Ropert also was responsible for the spiritual needs of local families whose children were sent overseas to fight in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. He also consoled Filipinos whose families were lost in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. Later in his reign, the Hawaiian Islands became a territory of the United States becoming the first bishop of the [[Territory of Hawaii|Territory of Hawai\u02bbi]]. Msgr. Ropert died on January 4, 1903, and was buried in Honolulu Catholic Cemetery.\n\n===Boeynaems===\n[[Image:Boeynaems Crest Honolulu.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Bishop Libert Hubert John Louis Boeynaems was the fourth Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands and led during World War I. His coat of arms adorns the cathedral.]]\nAgain it would take several months before [[Pope Leo XIII]] appointed someone to succeed the episcopacy in the Hawaiian Islands. On April 8, 1903, the pope appointed a Picpus Father from [[Antwerp]] in [[Belgium]], [[Libert H. Boeynaems|Libert Hubert John Louis Boeynaems]] to become the fourth Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. He was consecrated titular bishop of Zeugma. During his reign, Msgr. Boeynaems observed many of his faithful being sent to fight in [[Europe]] during [[World War I]]. He also oversaw the increasing militarization of the Hawaiian Islands. The entire coastline of the island of O{{okina}}ahu was fortified and several United States military bases were established, including: [[Fort Shafter]], [[Pearl Harbor]] and [[Schofield Barracks]]. With the absence of an established [[Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services|military ordinariate]] in the United States, Msgr. Boeynaems ministered to Catholic service members. After a period of illness, Msgr. Boeynaems died on May 13, 1926, and was buried in Honolulu Catholic Cemetery.\n\n===Alencastre===\n\n[[Image:Alencastre Window.jpg|thumb|250px|Pope Pius XI installed Stephen Alencastre of Portugal as fifth Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. Alencastre was the first person raised in Hawai{{okina}}i to become ordinary of the Hawaiian Church.]]\nWhen Msgr. Boeynaems became ill, [[Pope Pius XI]] elevated the first person to have grown up in the Hawaiian Islands to become a vicar apostolic. The pope appointed [[Stephen Alencastre|Stephen Peter Alencastre]], a Picpus Father born in [[Portugal]] who was brought as an infant to the Hawaiian Islands with his family to live. Msgr. Alencastre was raised and educated in Hawai{{okina}}i, living on the various islands. He subsequently graduated from Saint Louis College and was accepted into the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts. He was ordained to the priesthood and educated in Europe by the Picpus Fathers, earning a doctorate in sacred theology. He was later appointed and consecrated as coadjutor vicar apostolic and [[titular bishop of Arabissus]] to assist the ailing Msgr. Boeynaems, suffering in [[hospital]]. Upon Msgr. Boeynaems' death, Msgr. Alencastre succeeded as the fifth and final Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. Seeing a need for new locally trained priests, Msgr. Alencastre established Saint Stephen's Seminary in Kalihi Valley, named after his personal patron saint. He also oversaw the renovation of the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, modernizing it in time for the centennial celebration of the Catholic Church in Hawai{{okina}}i in 1927. He died aboard a ship en route from Los Angeles on November 9, 1940.\n\n==Diocese==\nMsgr. Alencastre's premonition that the vicariate would be elevated to diocesan status was fulfilled earlier than expected. Upon his death, [[Pope Pius XII|Venerable Pius XII]] decided that the Hawaiian Islands no longer needed a missionary church. Rather, its flourishing Catholic community was mature enough to be administered as a fully independent body of its own. The pope canonically erected the new Diocese of Honolulu on January 25, 1941.\n\n===Sweeney===\n\n[[Image:Honolulu Catholic Cemetery Iron Cross.jpg|200px|thumb|left|An iron cross at the [[Honolulu Catholic Cemetery]] marks the burial site of the bishops of the Hawaiian Islands.]]\nAfter several months of consideration, the Pope looked outside of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary for a successor to the last vicar apostolic. Pope Pius XII appointed a diocesan priest of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, [[James Joseph Sweeney]] as the first Bishop of Honolulu on May 20, 1941; Msgr. Sweeney was subsequently ordained to the episcopate on July 25, 1941, in the Cathedral of Saint Mary of Assumption in [[San Francisco, California]].\n\nBishop Sweeney's first few months in episcopacy happened in the advent of a most tragic event in Hawai{{okina}}i. On December 7, Japanese imperial forces bombed Pearl Harbor and scraped metropolitan Honolulu. Thousands of military and civilians died. Explosions were heard around downtown Honolulu and near the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace. Bishop Sweeney shepherded the diocese throughout [[World War II]].\n\n[[Pope John XXIII|Blessed John XXIII]] opened the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, and Bishop Sweeney was a council father, one of many prelates from the United States to attend the sessions. Inspired by the reforms agreed upon in [[Rome]], he enacted major changes to the liturgy in the Diocese of Honolulu. One of his actions was to renovate the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in keeping with the newly promulgated Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy. Soon all parishes offered Mass primarily in the [[English language|vernacular]] in place of [[Latin language|Latin]] and altars were built facing the congregation instead of the sanctuary wall. Slowly, other languages were incorporated into the Mass including the Hawaiian language. Bishop Sweeney also invited the [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marist Fathers and Brothers]] to staff several parishes on the islands of O{{okina}}ahu and Kaua{{okina}}i.\n\nBishop Sweeney fell ill and could not perform his duties with full vigor. His request for an auxiliary bishop was granted. Years later, Msgr. Sweeney died on his birthday on June 19, 1968. He was buried in [[Colma, California|Colma]] near San Francisco, where he spent his early years as a priest.\n\n===Scanlan===\n\n[[Pope Paul VI]] appointed [[John Joseph Scanlan]], the diocese's auxiliary bishop and apostolic administrator as its second ordinary on March 6, 1968. A San Francisco archdiocesan priest from [[County Cork]] in [[Ireland]], Msgr. Scanlan witnessed the growth of a young state of Hawai{{okina}}i. He was maintained cordial relations with the Catholic [[Governor of Hawaii|Governor of Hawai{{okina}}i]], [[John A. Burns]] even when the Hawai{{okina}}i legislature passed a bill permitting abortion on demand and Governor Burns allowed the bill to become law without his signature. Scanlan was also remembered for his invitation of several religious institutes to establish themselves in the Hawaiian Islands. Among such groups were the [[Society of Jesus]], the [[Christian Brothers of Ireland]], the [[Religious of the Virgin Mary]], and the [[Dominican Sisters]] of [[Iloilo]]. The Jesuits primarily minister to the students of the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawai{{okina}}i at M\u0101noa]].\n\nIn 1977, Msgr. Scanlan served as the principal consecrator of Father Joseph Ferrario as auxiliary bishop. His age was beginning to affect his work. Feeling the pressures of being 75 years old, Msgr. Scanlan chose to retire on June 30, 1981. He died on January 31, 1997, at Nazareth House in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]], a [[retirement home]] for priests and religious. His funeral was held at the metropolitan Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption and later at the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Honolulu. Bishop Scanlan, a father of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, had the honor of being buried beside Bishop Maigret, a father of the First Vatican Ecumenical Council, in a crypt under the sanctuary of the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace.\n\n===Ferrario===\n[[File:2018 Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus - Honolulu 02.jpg|thumb|250px|Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus]]\n[[Pope John Paul II]] appointed the diocese's auxiliary bishop [[Joseph Anthony Ferrario]], a former Sulpican educator and diocesan priest, as the third Bishop of Honolulu on May 13, 1982.\n\n===DiLorenzo===\n\nUpon Msgr. Ferrario's announcement of his retirement, the Vatican had appointed [[Francis X. DiLorenzo|Msgr. Francis DiLorenzo]], auxiliary bishop of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] as [[Apostolic Administrator|Apostolic Administrator of Honolulu]]. Later, on November 29, 1994, Pope John Paul II, appointed Msgr. DiLorenzo as the fourth Bishop of Honolulu. The Vatican later appointed Msgr. DiLorenzo as ordinary of the See of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] upon the announcement of the retirement of Richmond bishop [[Walter Francis Sullivan]]. Msgr. DiLorenzo assumed leadership of the Diocese of Richmond upon installation on May 24, 2004.\n\nWith the departure of Msgr. DiLorenzo, the diocesan college of consultors in accordance with the [[Code of Canon Law]], on May 28, 2004, elected from their peers [[Thomas L. Gross|Father Thomas L. Gross]] as temporary diocesan administrator. He also served on the committee that screened candidates for the post of Bishop of Honolulu. On February 1, 2006, [[Marc R. Alexander|Father Marc R. Alexander]] became diocesan administrator.\n\n===Silva===\n[[File:Diocese of Honolulu.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Diocesan Pastoral Center]]\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]] appointed [[Clarence Richard Silva]], the first native-born person in the episcopacy of the Hawaiian Islands to become a Bishop of Honolulu on May 17, 2005. He also became the second person of Portuguese ancestry in the episcopate since the Msgr. Stephen Peter Alencastre, SS.CC. Formerly the Vicar General of the Diocese of Oakland, Silva was ordained to the episcopate and installed as bishop at the [[Neal S. Blaisdell Center]] [[Arena]] on July 21. Over 3,500 were in attendance, making it one of the largest events held by the Diocese of Honolulu in its history.\n\nThe principal consecrator was [[William Joseph Levada]], Archbishop of San Francisco and newly appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The ordination and installation ceremony was the last official ceremonial function as metropolitan bishop over the Province of San Francisco for Levada; other non-ceremonial functions would continue until his official departure from office. Also in attendance were [[Gabriel Montalvo Higuera]], [[Archbishop Apostolic Nuncio to the United States]], and [[Anthony Apuron]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Agana|Archbishop of Agana]] as well as personal friend Deacon Larry Sousa of Norman, Oklahoma. Although scheduled to attend the episcopal ordination, [[Roger Mahony]], Cardinal [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archbishop of Los Angeles]], was unable to be present due to unforeseen airplane problems at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\n==Special Anniversaries of Significance to the Diocese==\n[[Image:Statue of Malia O Ka Malu.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Our Lady of Peace, the diocesan patroness, is honored on July 9 and August 15.]]\n*January 23 \u2013 Memorial, Saint [[Marianne Cope]], religious (2005)\n*January 25 \u2013 Anniversary of the Canonical Erection by Pope Pius XII of the Catholic Diocese of Honolulu (1941)\n*May 10 \u2013 Memorial, [[Saint Damien of Molokai]], religious (1995)\n*May 17 \u2013 Anniversary of the Appointment of Clarence Richard Silva, Vicar General of the Diocese of Oakland, as Fifth Bishop of Honolulu (2005)\n*July 9 \u2013 Memorial, Blessed Virgin Mary under the Title, Queen of Peace\n*July 21 \u2013 Anniversary of the Ordination to the Episcopate and Installation of Clarence Richard Silva as Fifth Bishop of Honolulu (2005)\n*July 28 \u2013 Anniversary of Dedication of the Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus, Honolulu (1985)\n*August 15 \u2013 Anniversary of Dedication of the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady, Queen of Peace, Honolulu (1843)\n\n==Parishes==\nSee, [[List of parishes of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu]].\n\n==Saints and Blesseds==\nThough the Diocese of Honolulu may be small, a number of Catholics have found their way to holiness and these include:\n* [[Father Damien|Jozef de Veuster]] (Damian of Molokai) (1840\u20131889), Professed Priest of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (Picpus)\n* [[Marianne Cope|Barbara Cope]] (Marianne) (1838\u20131918), Professed Religious of the Franciscan Sisters of Syracuse \n* [[Joseph Dutton|Ira Barnes Dutton]] (Joseph) (1843\u20131931), Layperson of the Diocese of Honolulu; Member of the Secular Franciscans\n* [[Helio Koa'eloa]] (ca. 1815\u20131846), Married Layperson of the Diocese of Honolulu \n* [[Gulstan Ropert|Gulstan-Francois Ropert]] (1839\u20131903), Professed Priest of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (Picpus); Apostolic Vicar of the Hawaiian Islands; Titular Bishop of Panopolis \n* [[Ambrose K.
