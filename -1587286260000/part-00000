Along with [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]], [[Francisco T\u00e1rrega]], and [[Enrique Granados]], he was one of Spain's most important musicians of the first half of the 20th century. He has a claim to being Spain's greatest composer of the 20th century, although the number of pieces he composed was relatively modest.\nHis image appeared on Spain's 1970 [[Spanish peseta|100-pesetas]] banknote.\n\n==Biography==\nFalla was born Manuel Mar\u00eda de los Dolores Falla y Matheu in [[Cadiz|C\u00e1diz]]. He was the son of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Falla, a Valencian, and Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Matheu, from Catalonia {{harv|Hess|2001a}}.\n\nIn 1889 he continued his piano lessons with Alejandro Odero and learned the techniques of [[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]] from Enrique Broca. At age 15 he became interested in literature and journalism and founded the literary magazines ''El Burl\u00f3n'' and ''El Cascabel''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Madrid===\n[[File:Calle de Serrano n\u00ba 72 (Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Housing building where Falla lived in Madrid from 1901 to 1907]]\nBy 1900 he was living with his family in the capital, where he attended the Real Conservatorio de M\u00fasica y Declamaci\u00f3n. He studied piano with Jos\u00e9 Trag\u00f3, a colleague of [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]], and composition with [[Felipe Pedrell]]. In 1897 he composed ''Melod\u00eda'' for cello and piano and dedicated it to [[Salvador Viniegra]], who hosted evenings of [[chamber music]] that Falla attended. In 1899, by unanimous vote, he was awarded the first prize at the piano competition at his school of music. He premiered his first works: ''Romanza para violonchelo y piano'', ''Nocturno para piano'', ''Melod\u00eda para violonchelo y piano'', ''Serenata andaluza para viol\u00edn y piano'', and ''Cuarteto en Sol y Mireya''. That same year he started to use ''de'' with his first surname, making ''Manuel de Falla'' the name he became known as from that time on. When only the surname is used, however, the ''de'' is omitted.\n\nIn 1900 he composed his ''Canci\u00f3n para piano'' and various other vocal and piano pieces. He premiered his ''Serenata andaluza y Vals-Capricho para piano'' in the [[Ateneo de Madrid]]. Due to the precarious financial position of his family, he began to teach piano classes.\n\nIt was from Pedrell, during the Madrid period, that Falla became interested in the music of his native [[Andalusia]], particularly Andalusian [[flamenco]] (specifically ''[[cante jondo]]''), the influence of which can be strongly felt in many of his works {{harv|Mercurio|2014|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--It does not take an entire 15-page article to establish this simple statement.-->}}. Among his early pieces are a number of [[zarzuela]]s like ''La Juana y la Petra'' and ''La casa de t\u00f3came Roque''. On 12 April 1902 he premiered ''Los amores de la In\u00e9s'' in the Teatro C\u00f3mico de Madrid. The same year he met the composer [[Joaqu\u00edn Turina]] and saw his ''Vals-Capricho'' y ''Serenata andaluza'' published by the Society of Authors.\n\nThe following year he composed and performed ''Allegro de concierto'' for the [[Madrid Royal Conservatory]] competition. [[Enrique Granados]] took first prize with his composition of the same title, but the Society of Authors published Falla's works ''Tus ojillos negros'' and ''Nocturno''. Falla then began his collaboration with composer [[Amadeo Vives]] on the zarzuelas ''Prisionero de guerra'', ''El cornet\u00edn de \u00f3rdenes'' and ''La cruz de Malta'' (only fragments of these works survive).\n\nHis first important work was the one-act [[opera]] ''[[La vida breve]]'' (''Life is Short'', or ''The Brief Life'', written in 1905, though revised before its premiere in 1913). With a libretto by [[Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw]], ''La vida breve'' won Falla first prize in the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] musical competition, with a prize of 2500 pesetas and a promise of a production at the [[Teatro Real|Teatro Royal]] in Madrid\u2014a pledge which unfortunately was not fulfilled {{harv|Harper|1998|loc=17}}.  In April 1905 he won the first prize in a piano competition sponsored by the firm of Ortiz and Cuss\u00f3. On 15 May his work ''Allegro de concierto'' premiered at the Ateneo de Madrid and on 13 November the Real Academia presented him with his prize for ''La vida breve''.\n\n===Paris===\nFalla moved to Paris in 1907, where he remained for seven years. There he met a number of composers who had an influence on his style, including  [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Paul Dukas]], as well as [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Florent Schmitt]], [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]] and the impresario [[Sergei Diaghilev]] {{harv|Hess|2001a}}. In 1908 [[King Alfonso XIII]] awarded him a royal grant that enabled him to remain in Paris while he finished his ''Cuatro piezas espa\u00f1olas''. In 1910 Falla met Stravinsky and in 1911\u201312 traveled to London, Brussels and Milan to give concerts and investigate possible venues for ''La vida breve'', which he had composed shortly after his arrival in Paris in 1907 but which, despite the support of Dukas and Falla's own best efforts, was not finally performed until 1 April 1913 at the Municipal Casino in [[Nice]], with the libretto translated into French by the dramatist [[Paul Milliet]]. A second production was given the following year at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, to acclaim from critics such as [[Pierre Lalo]] and Andr\u00e9 Coeuroy {{harv|Hess|2001a}}. He wrote ''Siete canciones populares espa\u00f1olas'', which he finished in mid-1914. Shortly after, [[World War I]] began, forcing Falla to return to Madrid {{harv|Hess|2001a}}. While at no stage was he a prolific composer, it was then that he entered into his mature creative period.\n\n===Return to Madrid===\nIn Madrid he composed several of his best-known pieces, including:\n* The [[nocturne]] for piano and orchestra ''[[Noches en los jardines de Espa\u00f1a]]'' (1916)\n* The [[ballet (music)|ballet]] ''[[El amor brujo]]'' (1915) which includes the much excerpted and arranged ''[[Danza ritual del fuego]]''\n* The ballet ''The Magistrate and the Miller's Wife'' (''El corregidor y la molinera'') which, after revision, became ''[[El sombrero de tres picos]]'' (1917) and was produced by [[Sergei Diaghilev|Serge Diaghilev]] with set design and costumes by [[Pablo Picasso]]. It derives from ''[[The Three-Cornered Hat (novel)|The Three-Cornered Hat]]'' (1874), a novel written by [[Pedro Antonio de Alarc\u00f3n]] {{harv|Bedmar Estrada|n.d.}}.\n\n===Granada period===\n[[File:Manuel de Falla con bast\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|150px|Manuel de Falla with walking stick (date unknown)]]\nFrom 1921 to 1939 Manuel de Falla lived in [[Granada]], where he organized the [[Concurso de Cante Jondo]] in 1922. In Granada he wrote the puppet opera ''[[El retablo de maese Pedro]]'' (''Master Peter's Puppet Show'', 1923) and a [[concerto]] for [[harpsichord]] and [[chamber music|chamber]] ensemble (''[[Harpsichord Concerto (De Falla)|Harpsichord Concerto]]'', 1926). The puppet opera marked the first time Falla included the harpsichord in  his orchestra. Both of these works were written with [[Wanda Landowska]] in mind. In these works, the Spanish folk influence is somewhat less apparent than a kind of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinskian]] [[neoclassicism]] ({{harvnb|Hess|2001a}}; {{harvnb|Hess|2001b|loc=234, 239}}; {{harvnb|Hess|2004|loc=139, 146, 151}}).\n\nAlso in Granada, Falla began work on the large-scale orchestral cantata ''[[Atl\u00e1ntida (opera)|Atl\u00e1ntida]]'' (''Atlantis''), based on the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] text ''[[L'Atl\u00e0ntida]]'' by [[Jacint Verdaguer]].\n\n===Argentina===\nFalla continued work on ''Atl\u00e1ntida'' after moving to [[Argentina]] in 1939, following [[Francisco Franco]]'s victory in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. (The orchestration of the piece remained incomplete at his death and was completed posthumously by [[Ernesto Halffter]].) He also premiered his ''Suite Homenajes'' in [[Buenos Aires]] in November 1939. In 1940, he was named a Knight of the Order of King [[Alfonso X of Castile]]. Franco's government offered him a large pension if he would return to Spain, but he refused.\n\nFalla did spend some time teaching in exile. Among his notable pupils was composer [[Rosa Garc\u00eda Ascot]]. His health began to decline and he moved to a house in the mountains where he was tended by his sister Mar\u00eda del Carmen de Falla (1882\u20131971). He died of [[cardiac arrest]] on 14 November 1946 in [[Alta Gracia]], in the Argentine province of [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He had left in writing that he wanted to be buried in the Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba in Argentina. The Spanish Embassy of Francisco Franco decided to bring him back to Spain.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} In 1947 his remains were brought back to Spain and entombed in the cathedral at C\u00e1diz. One of the lasting honors to his memory is the Manuel de Falla Chair of Music in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. His image appeared on Spanish currency notes for some years. Manuel de Falla never married and had no children.{{Citation needed|ydate=May 2016|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Works===\n{{For|listings of Falla's compositions|List of compositions by Manuel de Falla|List of works for the stage by Manuel de Falla}}\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''1935''': Associate of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]] ({{harvnb|Anon.|n.d.}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|[2006]|loc=73}}).\n* '''1940''': Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of Alfonso X the Wise]].\n* Member of the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]\n* Member of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Angustias.\n\n== Legacy ==\nFalla's house in Granada is preserved as a biographical museum {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}.\n\n=== Recordings by Falla ===\n*Manuel de Falla 1876\u20131946 Grabaciones hist\u00f3ricas; [[Centro de Documentaci\u00f3n Musical de Andaluc\u00eda]].

In these works, the Spanish folk influence is somewhat less apparent than a kind of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinskian]] [[neoclassicism]] ({{harvnb|Hess|2001a}}; {{harvnb|Hess|2001b|loc=234, 239}}; {{harvnb|Hess|2004|loc=139, 146, 151}}).\n\nAlso in Granada, Falla began work on the large-scale orchestral cantata ''[[Atl\u00e1ntida (opera)|Atl\u00e1ntida]]'' (''Atlantis''), based on the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] text ''[[L'Atl\u00e0ntida]]'' by [[Jacint Verdaguer]].\n\n===Argentina===\nFalla continued work on ''Atl\u00e1ntida'' after moving to [[Argentina]] in 1939, following [[Francisco Franco]]'s victory in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. (The orchestration of the piece remained incomplete at his death and was completed posthumously by [[Ernesto Halffter]].) He also premiered his ''Suite Homenajes'' in [[Buenos Aires]] in November 1939. In 1940, he was named a Knight of the Order of King [[Alfonso X of Castile]]. Franco's government offered him a large pension if he would return to Spain, but he refused.\n\nFalla did spend some time teaching in exile. Among his notable pupils was composer [[Rosa Garc\u00eda Ascot]]. His health began to decline and he moved to a house in the mountains where he was tended by his sister Mar\u00eda del Carmen de Falla (1882\u20131971). He died of [[cardiac arrest]] on 14 November 1946 in [[Alta Gracia]], in the Argentine province of [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He had left in writing that he wanted to be buried in the Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba in Argentina. The Spanish Embassy of Francisco Franco decided to bring him back to Spain.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} In 1947 his remains were brought back to Spain and entombed in the cathedral at C\u00e1diz. One of the lasting honors to his memory is the Manuel de Falla Chair of Music in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. His image appeared on Spanish currency notes for some years. Manuel de Falla never married and had no children.{{Citation needed|ydate=May 2016|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Works===\n{{For|listings of Falla's compositions|List of compositions by Manuel de Falla|List of works for the stage by Manuel de Falla}}\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''1935''': Associate of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]] ({{harvnb|Anon.|n.d.}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|[2006]|loc=73}}).\n* '''1940''': Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of Alfonso X the Wise]].\n* Member of the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]\n* Member of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Angustias.\n\n== Legacy ==\nFalla's house in Granada is preserved as a biographical museum {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}.\n\n=== Recordings by Falla ===\n*Manuel de Falla 1876\u20131946 Grabaciones hist\u00f3ricas; [[Centro de Documentaci\u00f3n Musical de Andaluc\u00eda]].

{"title_page": "Doctor Who Appreciation Society", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Doctor Who'' Appreciation Society}}\n{{Infobox organization\n| image = \n| formation = 1976\n| name = Doctor Who Appreciation Society\n| native_name = \n| membership = \n| website = {{URL|www.dwasonline.co.uk}}\n| abbreviation = DWAS\n| President = Colin Baker\n| region = Worldwide (based in United Kingdom)\n}}\n\nThe '''''Doctor Who'' Appreciation Society''' (DWAS) is a society for fans of the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. It was founded in May 1976, emerging from the [[Westfield College]] ''Doctor Who'' Appreciation Society and the editors and readers of the [[Doctor who fandom#Fanzines|fanzine]] ''Tardis''.\n\nThe society produces a monthly print magazine, ''Celestial Toyroom'' (sent to the society's members), a quarterly digital magazine, ''Cosmic Masque'' (free to access via the DWAS website), hosts conventions, organises a network of local groups, and provides discounts to members for ''Doctor Who''-related merchandise for sale on the society's online shop. Since 2017 it has also published 'The Celestial Toyroom Annual' which is a compendium of items about a specific lead actor's contribution. The annuals are free to download with a limited run print copy produced for charity. The 2020 annual featured the Jon Pertwee era.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1970s \u2013 origins ===\nThe society gained recognition from the ''Doctor Who'' production office at the [[BBC]] in 1976, succeeding the ''Doctor Who'' Fan Club which had operated since the late 1960s. Whereas the earlier fan clubs had often had only a single organiser, the DWAS was headed by an executive committee.\n\nEarly activities included the establishment of a newsletter to promote fan communication through pen-pals and swaps, titled ''The Celestial Toyroom'' after the first episode of the story ''[[The Celestial Toymaker]]'', and the establishment of a reference department to collate and circulate accurate information about the production and storyline of each ''Doctor Who'' episode, headed by Jeremy Bentham. Early recognition came when the second edition of ''The Making of Doctor Who'' (1976) acknowledged society president Jan Vincent-Rudzki and co-ordinator Stephen Payne \"and members of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society\" for their help in writing the book.<ref>Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, ''The Making of Doctor Who'', London:Target, 1976, p. 6</ref> 1977 saw members of the society help with the BBC documentary ''Whose Doctor Who?'', and the society stage the first ''Doctor Who'' convention, held at Broomwood Church Hall, Broomwood Road, [[Battersea]], [[London]] on 6 August 1977.\n\nDuring 1976 and 1977 membership of the society had been free of charge. Membership seems to have been loosely defined, and members and non-members paid to receive ''Tardis'', ''The Celestial Toyroom'' (which was merged with ''Tardis'' for the duration of 1977) and other items such as the reference department's 'StInfos' without any of these charges being interpreted as society membership fees. However, anxieties expressed by the production office and the BBC's legal department about the reproduction of copyright material contributed towards the introduction of a membership fee with effect from January 1978. Restrictions on the exchange of copyrighted material such as off-air audio recordings through the society's publications were also introduced.<ref>Gordon Blows, 'Publications notice', ''Tardis77'', 6, 28 August 1977, p. 18</ref> A restyled ''Celestial Toyroom'' would be sent to all society members to carry news about the programme, associated merchandise, and the society, while members would continue to pay for ''Tardis'', which moved from monthly to bi-monthly publication, and reference department items.<ref>Gordon Blows, 'Society announcement to all members', ''Tardis77'', 7, 9 October 1977, p. 2</ref>\n\nThis set the pattern for the next few years. Late 1977 saw the emergence of the DWAS's fiction magazine, ''Cosmic Masque'', edited initially by [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]] and Steven Roy Evans (writer). In 1978 the convention was given the name Panopticon, named after both the ceremonial gathering-place on [[Gallifrey]] and the [[Panopticon|prison building]] designed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], namesake and ancestor of the head of the society's reference department. The advent of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Weekly]]'' in October 1979 led to changes as Bentham became its principal feature writer, and resigned as head of the reference department. He was replaced by [[David J. Howe]].\n\n=== 1980s to present ===\nDuring 1980 the remaining founders of the society resigned from the executive, president Jan Vincent-Rudzki departing in August.<ref>Jan Vincent-Rudzki, 'The President's Column', ''Celestial Toyroom'', August 1980, p. 2</ref> Vincent-Rudzki went on to join Stephen Payne in founding the magazine publishing company [[Visual Imagination]].\n\nChallenges faced by the society in the early 1980s included tighter control of news by the production office; Vincent-Rudzki complained in his last president's column that independent fanzines were printing news about the forthcoming season which the production office had asked DWAS not to publicise. This would be an issue throughout the 1980s. Another issue was the growth of the society's local group network, which by October 1980 included seventeen groups, two of which were in North America. The society executive felt that they were unable to effectively supervise overseas groups, for whose actions they had legal responsibility, and withdrew recognition from them as DWAS local groups.<ref>''Celestial Toyroom'', October 1980, p. 1</ref> The society continued to recognise an allied North American ''Doctor Who'' Appreciation Society until 1984, but the change encouraged the formation of the ''Doctor Who'' Information Network as a fully distinct society for ''Doctor Who'' fans in Canada.\n\nNew ideas introduced in the early 1980s included a fanzine poll and regular fanzine reviews in ''Celestial Toyroom''. Smaller events such as Interfaces and DWASocials began, complementing Panopticon. The local group network continued to expand. While the executive never became an elected committee, executive members made visits to local groups and the DWASocials included panels where society members could express their views on society governance.  Membership fell for a period in the early 1980s \u2013 recorded at 1820 in the August 1981 ''Celestial Toyroom'', it had fallen to 1000 by November 1982 \u2013 but then began an upturn, reaching 1175 by March 1983, and 1550 by December. The rise was probably helped by the DWAS's presence at the BBC-run Doctor Who convention held at [[Longleat]], [[Wiltshire]], in March 1983. Membership peaked at just over 3000 in the mid 1980s.\n\nDuring the early 1980s ''Celestial Toyroom'' remained a brief monthly newsletter, with ''Tardis'' (which moved to quarterly publication in 1983) being the main forum of articles and letters.\n\nDevelopments in the late 1980s included a decline in membership, perhaps due to the evolution of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' into a more fan-based publication. Rival services also appeared, such as [[Dreamwatch|DWB]] for monthly news, The Whonatics or the MLG for local gatherings, and Phoenix for conventions.\n\nFailure to register for [[VAT]] led to a crisis in the Society's finances in the late 1980s, but the DWAS recovered from this to survive as the core grouping of [[Doctor Who fandom]] in the UK. A separate company, Space Rocket Ltd, now administers commercial affairs such as conventions and sales, on behalf of the DWAS. This does not extend to running 'Panopticon' which was for some years regarded by many as the premier UK Doctor Who event. The rights rest with a company called 'Dominitemporal Services Ltd' into which many DWAS commercial services were initially hived, following the VAT problems. DWAS holds only a minority stake in the company and has yet to succeed in bringing the 'Panopticon' brand back to the Doctor Who events market \u2013 the Society had absolutely no involvement in the last Panopticon in 2003 \u2013 the first totally DWAS-free Panopticon.\n\nDespite this, DWAS remains a presence amongst UK events organisers and has had a long association with Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, presenting many events there since 2004. These have included some organised with the cooperation of [[BBC Worldwide]] (and before that [[2 Entertain|2Entertain]]), most notably a full advance screening of the 'Day of the Daleks' DVD Special Edition in 2011.\n\nThe Society has had a number of Honorary Presidents. The first was Jon Pertwee, who held the post until his death in 1996. From 1997 until his death in 2011, the Society's honorary president was [[Nicholas Courtney]], who played the hugely popular recurring character [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]] on the series from 1968 to 1989. Upon Courtney's death, [[Colin Baker]], who played the [[Sixth Doctor|sixth incarnation]] of the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]], was elected as his replacement.\n\n=== 40th Anniversary (2016) ===\nIn May 2016, the DWAS celebrated its 40th anniversary, having been in existence since 1976. Celebrations included a two-day convention, ''The Capitol'', held at the Arora Hotel, [[Gatwick, Surrey|Gatwick]] on Saturday 6th and Sunday 7 May 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/thecapitol/|title=The Capitol: Two day Doctor Who convention organised by the DWAS|website=www.dwasonline.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> the digital revival of the [[fan fiction]]-based magazine ''Cosmic Masque,'' and a members' poll on numerous aspects of the show with awards presented at ''The Capitol''. The Society also produced a small number of commemorative items such as 40th anniversary badges and mugs.\n\n'The Capitol' has subsequently become the Society's primary convention brand with further events held in 2017 and 2018, and  2019 with another planned for 2020\n\n== Blue Plaques ==\nIn 2014, DWAS raised funds for a blue heritage plaque erected at [[Riverside Studios]] in Hammersmith in memory of the show's first producer [[Verity Lambert]]. This was unveiled by her friend and well known director [[Waris Hussein]] at a special free-to-enter event which included a big screen presentation of the BBC docu-drama ''[[An Adventure in Space and Time]]''. Following the closure for redevelopment of Riverside later that year, the plaque was placed into storage pending completion of the new Riverside in 2019.\n\nFollowing this, in 2016, the Society raised funds for another plaque in memory of [[Jon Pertwee]] at [[New Wimbledon Theatre]] in London. This was unveiled at another free-to-enter event on 23 October 2016 by the Society's current president [[Colin Baker]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/polarityday/|title=Polarity Day|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=1 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2018, the Society announced that agreement had been reached with [[Ealing Studios]] for a plaque honouring [[William Hartnell]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Winter|first1=Paul|title=William Hartnell Heritage Plaque|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/node/1351|website=Doctor Who Appreciation Society|date=1 August 2018}}</ref> The plaque was unveiled on 14 October 2018 by Hartnell's granddaughter, Jessica Carney.<ref>{{cite web|title=DWAS Honours William Hartnell|url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2018/10/dwas-honours-william-hartnell.html|website=Doctor Who News|date=14 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Magazines ==\nThe Society currently produces a number of regular magazines.\n\n=== ''Celestial Toyroom'' ===\n''Celestial Toyroom'' is the monthly print magazine, twelve issues of which are sent to members of the DWAS each year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/membership|title=Membership {{!}} DWAS Online|website=www.dwasonline.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> Articles are often contributed by members of the Society as well as by more well-known writers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/celestial_toyroom|title=Celestial Toyroom {{!}} DWAS Online|website=www.dwasonline.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> The magazine contains a mix of critical essays on ''Doctor Who'', interviews with cast and crew and other features, including a short comic strip, ''Whom?'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/WeirdBean/status/713311350387245057|title=Weird Bean on Twitter|website=Twitter|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> and various features that could be said to think outside the box.\n\n=== ''Cosmic Masque'' ===\nAlongside ''Celestial Toyroom'' is ''Cosmic Masque'', a quarterly digital magazine, revived in Christmas 2015 for the 40th anniversary of the Society in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/node/1158|title=Cosmic Masque is coming... {{!}} DWAS Online|website=www.dwasonline.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> This is free to access by anyone of the DWAS website, and concentrates more on fan fiction, as well as featuring reviews and fans' letters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/node/1188|title=Cosmic Masque New Volume {{!}} DWAS Online|website=www.dwasonline.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> The magazine can be downloaded from www.dwasonline.co.uk\n\n=== ''The Celestial Toyroom Annual'' ===\nFirst published in 2016 the CT Annual is released over the Christmas and New year holiday period.

It was edited by Paul Winter\nThe annual can be downloaded from www.dwasonline.co.uk\n<br />\n=== ''TARDIS'' ===\n\nTARDIS was the Society's original fan magazine although in fact, it predated the formation of DWAS first being published in early 1976. For many years TARDIS was published as an optional addition to the main Society offering until it was merged into Celestial Toyroom in 1987. An attempt to revive the title in 1997 met with limited success and only ran for six issues. A special edition was produced in 2003 to celebrate the programme's 40th anniversary. In 2020 the Society announced a further plan to relaunch TARDIS as a distinct magazine, featuring wholly commissioned content.\n\n== Events (2015 onwards) ==\nThe ''Doctor Who Appreciation Society'' regularly organises ''Doctor Who'' events that take place at venues around the UK.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Title\n!Date\n!Location\n|-\n|''Back to the Eighties''\n|24/10/15\n|Pendulum Hotel, Manchester\n|-\n|''The Capitol''\n|07/05/16-08/05/16\n|Arora Hotel Gatwick, Crawley\n|-\n|''Polarity Day''\n|23/10/16\n|New Wimbledon Theatre\n|-\n|''The Capitol II''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/thecapitol/|title=DWAS \u2013 The Capitol|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n|06/05/17-07/05/17\n|Arora Hotel Gatwick, Crawley\n|-\n|''The Capitol III''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/thecapitol/|title=DWAS \u2013 The Capitol|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n|28/04/2018 \u2013 29/04/2018\n|Arora Hotel Gatwick, Crawley\n|-\n|''Series 11 Launch Party''\n|07/10/2018\n|Saks Bar, Southend\n|-\n|''The Capitol IV''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/thecapitol/|title=DWAS \u2013 The Capitol|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n|27/04/2019 \u2013 28/04/2019\n|Arora Hotel Gatwick, Crawley\n|}\n\n==Audio productions==\nIn 1995, the ''Doctor Who'' Appreciation Society produced and sold a collection of ''Doctor Who'' audio adventures entitled ''Cosmic Fugue'', a spin-off from DWAS's fiction magazine, ''Cosmic Masque'', edited and produced by Jonathan Way and Steven Wickham.

It was founded in May 1976, emerging from the [[Westfield College]] ''Doctor Who'' Appreciation Society and the editors and readers of the [[Doctor who fandom#Fanzines|fanzine]] ''Tardis''.\n\nThe society produces a monthly print magazine, ''Celestial Toyroom'' (sent to the society's members), a quarterly digital magazine, ''Cosmic Masque'' (free to access via the DWAS website), hosts conventions, organises a network of local groups, and provides discounts to members for ''Doctor Who''-related merchandise for sale on the society's online shop. Since 2017 it has also published 'The Celestial Toyroom Annual' which is a compendium of items about a specific lead actor's contribution. The annuals are free to download with a limited run print copy produced for charity. The 2020 annual featured the Jon Pertwee era.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1970s \u2013 origins ===\nThe society gained recognition from the ''Doctor Who'' production office at the [[BBC]] in 1976, succeeding the ''Doctor Who'' Fan Club which had operated since the late 1960s. Whereas the earlier fan clubs had often had only a single organiser, the DWAS was headed by an executive committee.\n\nEarly activities included the establishment of a newsletter to promote fan communication through pen-pals and swaps, titled ''The Celestial Toyroom'' after the first episode of the story ''[[The Celestial Toymaker]]'', and the establishment of a reference department to collate and circulate accurate information about the production and storyline of each ''Doctor Who'' episode, headed by Jeremy Bentham. Early recognition came when the second edition of ''The Making of Doctor Who'' (1976) acknowledged society president Jan Vincent-Rudzki and co-ordinator Stephen Payne \"and members of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society\" for their help in writing the book.<ref>Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, ''The Making of Doctor Who'', London:Target, 1976, p. 6</ref> 1977 saw members of the society help with the BBC documentary ''Whose Doctor Who?'', and the society stage the first ''Doctor Who'' convention, held at Broomwood Church Hall, Broomwood Road, [[Battersea]], [[London]] on 6 August 1977.\n\nDuring 1976 and 1977 membership of the society had been free of charge. Membership seems to have been loosely defined, and members and non-members paid to receive ''Tardis'', ''The Celestial Toyroom'' (which was merged with ''Tardis'' for the duration of 1977) and other items such as the reference department's 'StInfos' without any of these charges being interpreted as society membership fees. However, anxieties expressed by the production office and the BBC's legal department about the reproduction of copyright material contributed towards the introduction of a membership fee with effect from January 1978. Restrictions on the exchange of copyrighted material such as off-air audio recordings through the society's publications were also introduced.<ref>Gordon Blows, 'Publications notice', ''Tardis77'', 6, 28 August 1977, p. 18</ref> A restyled ''Celestial Toyroom'' would be sent to all society members to carry news about the programme, associated merchandise, and the society, while members would continue to pay for ''Tardis'', which moved from monthly to bi-monthly publication, and reference department items.<ref>Gordon Blows, 'Society announcement to all members', ''Tardis77'', 7, 9 October 1977, p. 2</ref>\n\nThis set the pattern for the next few years. Late 1977 saw the emergence of the DWAS's fiction magazine, ''Cosmic Masque'', edited initially by [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]] and Steven Roy Evans (writer). In 1978 the convention was given the name Panopticon, named after both the ceremonial gathering-place on [[Gallifrey]] and the [[Panopticon|prison building]] designed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], namesake and ancestor of the head of the society's reference department. The advent of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Weekly]]'' in October 1979 led to changes as Bentham became its principal feature writer, and resigned as head of the reference department. He was replaced by [[David J. Howe]].\n\n=== 1980s to present ===\nDuring 1980 the remaining founders of the society resigned from the executive, president Jan Vincent-Rudzki departing in August.<ref>Jan Vincent-Rudzki, 'The President's Column', ''Celestial Toyroom'', August 1980, p. 2</ref> Vincent-Rudzki went on to join Stephen Payne in founding the magazine publishing company [[Visual Imagination]].\n\nChallenges faced by the society in the early 1980s included tighter control of news by the production office; Vincent-Rudzki complained in his last president's column that independent fanzines were printing news about the forthcoming season which the production office had asked DWAS not to publicise. This would be an issue throughout the 1980s. Another issue was the growth of the society's local group network, which by October 1980 included seventeen groups, two of which were in North America. The society executive felt that they were unable to effectively supervise overseas groups, for whose actions they had legal responsibility, and withdrew recognition from them as DWAS local groups.<ref>''Celestial Toyroom'', October 1980, p. 1</ref> The society continued to recognise an allied North American ''Doctor Who'' Appreciation Society until 1984, but the change encouraged the formation of the ''Doctor Who'' Information Network as a fully distinct society for ''Doctor Who'' fans in Canada.\n\nNew ideas introduced in the early 1980s included a fanzine poll and regular fanzine reviews in ''Celestial Toyroom''. Smaller events such as Interfaces and DWASocials began, complementing Panopticon. The local group network continued to expand. While the executive never became an elected committee, executive members made visits to local groups and the DWASocials included panels where society members could express their views on society governance.  Membership fell for a period in the early 1980s \u2013 recorded at 1820 in the August 1981 ''Celestial Toyroom'', it had fallen to 1000 by November 1982 \u2013 but then began an upturn, reaching 1175 by March 1983, and 1550 by December. The rise was probably helped by the DWAS's presence at the BBC-run Doctor Who convention held at [[Longleat]], [[Wiltshire]], in March 1983. Membership peaked at just over 3000 in the mid 1980s.\n\nDuring the early 1980s ''Celestial Toyroom'' remained a brief monthly newsletter, with ''Tardis'' (which moved to quarterly publication in 1983) being the main forum of articles and letters.\n\nDevelopments in the late 1980s included a decline in membership, perhaps due to the evolution of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' into a more fan-based publication. Rival services also appeared, such as [[Dreamwatch|DWB]] for monthly news, The Whonatics or the MLG for local gatherings, and Phoenix for conventions.\n\nFailure to register for [[VAT]] led to a crisis in the Society's finances in the late 1980s, but the DWAS recovered from this to survive as the core grouping of [[Doctor Who fandom]] in the UK. A separate company, Space Rocket Ltd, now administers commercial affairs such as conventions and sales, on behalf of the DWAS. This does not extend to running 'Panopticon' which was for some years regarded by many as the premier UK Doctor Who event. The rights rest with a company called 'Dominitemporal Services Ltd' into which many DWAS commercial services were initially hived, following the VAT problems. DWAS holds only a minority stake in the company and has yet to succeed in bringing the 'Panopticon' brand back to the Doctor Who events market \u2013 the Society had absolutely no involvement in the last Panopticon in 2003 \u2013 the first totally DWAS-free Panopticon.\n\nDespite this, DWAS remains a presence amongst UK events organisers and has had a long association with Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, presenting many events there since 2004. These have included some organised with the cooperation of [[BBC Worldwide]] (and before that [[2 Entertain|2Entertain]]), most notably a full advance screening of the 'Day of the Daleks' DVD Special Edition in 2011.\n\nThe Society has had a number of Honorary Presidents. The first was Jon Pertwee, who held the post until his death in 1996. From 1997 until his death in 2011, the Society's honorary president was [[Nicholas Courtney]], who played the hugely popular recurring character [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]] on the series from 1968 to 1989. Upon Courtney's death, [[Colin Baker]], who played the [[Sixth Doctor|sixth incarnation]] of the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]], was elected as his replacement.\n\n=== 40th Anniversary (2016) ===\nIn May 2016, the DWAS celebrated its 40th anniversary, having been in existence since 1976. Celebrations included a two-day convention, ''The Capitol'', held at the Arora Hotel, [[Gatwick, Surrey|Gatwick]] on Saturday 6th and Sunday 7 May 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/thecapitol/|title=The Capitol: Two day Doctor Who convention organised by the DWAS|website=www.dwasonline.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> the digital revival of the [[fan fiction]]-based magazine ''Cosmic Masque,'' and a members' poll on numerous aspects of the show with awards presented at ''The Capitol''. The Society also produced a small number of commemorative items such as 40th anniversary badges and mugs.\n\n'The Capitol' has subsequently become the Society's primary convention brand with further events held in 2017 and 2018, and  2019 with another planned for 2020\n\n== Blue Plaques ==\nIn 2014, DWAS raised funds for a blue heritage plaque erected at [[Riverside Studios]] in Hammersmith in memory of the show's first producer [[Verity Lambert]]. This was unveiled by her friend and well known director [[Waris Hussein]] at a special free-to-enter event which included a big screen presentation of the BBC docu-drama ''[[An Adventure in Space and Time]]''. Following the closure for redevelopment of Riverside later that year, the plaque was placed into storage pending completion of the new Riverside in 2019.\n\nFollowing this, in 2016, the Society raised funds for another plaque in memory of [[Jon Pertwee]] at [[New Wimbledon Theatre]] in London. This was unveiled at another free-to-enter event on 23 October 2016 by the Society's current president [[Colin Baker]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/polarityday/|title=Polarity Day|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=1 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2018, the Society announced that agreement had been reached with [[Ealing Studios]] for a plaque honouring [[William Hartnell]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Winter|first1=Paul|title=William Hartnell Heritage Plaque|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/node/1351|website=Doctor Who Appreciation Society|date=1 August 2018}}</ref> The plaque was unveiled on 14 October 2018 by Hartnell's granddaughter, Jessica Carney.<ref>{{cite web|title=DWAS Honours William Hartnell|url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2018/10/dwas-honours-william-hartnell.html|website=Doctor Who News|date=14 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Magazines ==\nThe Society currently produces a number of regular magazines.\n\n=== ''Celestial Toyroom'' ===\n''Celestial Toyroom'' is the monthly print magazine, twelve issues of which are sent to members of the DWAS each year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/membership|title=Membership {{!}} DWAS Online|website=www.dwasonline.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> Articles are often contributed by members of the Society as well as by more well-known writers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/celestial_toyroom|title=Celestial Toyroom {{!}} DWAS Online|website=www.dwasonline.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> The magazine contains a mix of critical essays on ''Doctor Who'', interviews with cast and crew and other features, including a short comic strip, ''Whom?'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/WeirdBean/status/713311350387245057|title=Weird Bean on Twitter|website=Twitter|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> and various features that could be said to think outside the box.\n\n=== ''Cosmic Masque'' ===\nAlongside ''Celestial Toyroom'' is ''Cosmic Masque'', a quarterly digital magazine, revived in Christmas 2015 for the 40th anniversary of the Society in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/node/1158|title=Cosmic Masque is coming... {{!}} DWAS Online|website=www.dwasonline.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> This is free to access by anyone of the DWAS website, and concentrates more on fan fiction, as well as featuring reviews and fans' letters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/node/1188|title=Cosmic Masque New Volume {{!}} DWAS Online|website=www.dwasonline.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> The magazine can be downloaded from www.dwasonline.co.uk\n\n=== ''The Celestial Toyroom Annual'' ===\nFirst published in 2016 the CT Annual is released over the Christmas and New year holiday period.

It was edited by John Davies\n\nThe 2018 Annual covered the era of the 12th Doctor. It was edited by Paul Winter\n\nThe 2019 Annual covered the era of the 1st Doctor. It was edited by Paul Winter\n\nThe 2020 Annual covered the era of the 3rd Doctor. It was edited by Paul Winter\nThe annual can be downloaded from www.dwasonline.co.uk\n<br />\n=== ''TARDIS'' ===\n\nTARDIS was the Society's original fan magazine although in fact, it predated the formation of DWAS first being published in early 1976. For many years TARDIS was published as an optional addition to the main Society offering until it was merged into Celestial Toyroom in 1987. An attempt to revive the title in 1997 met with limited success and only ran for six issues. A special edition was produced in 2003 to celebrate the programme's 40th anniversary. In 2020 the Society announced a further plan to relaunch TARDIS as a distinct magazine, featuring wholly commissioned content.
