'''Little Turtle's War''', and by other names, was a war between the [[United States]] and a confederation of numerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, with support from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], for control of the [[Northwest Territory]]. It followed centuries of conflict over this territory, first among Native American tribes, and then with the added shifting alliances among the tribes and the European powers of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Great Britain]], and their colonials. The [[United States Army]] considers it their first of the [[American Indian Wars|United States Indian Wars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.army.mil/html/reference/army_flag/iw.html |title=Indian Wars Campaigns |website=U.S. Army Center of Military History |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nUnder the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], Great Britain ceded to the U.S. \"control\" of what were known as the Ohio Country and the Illinois Country, which were occupied by numerous Native American peoples. Despite the treaty, the British kept forts there and continued policies that supported the Native Americans. With the encroachment of European settlers west of the Appalachians after the War, a Huron-led confederacy formed in 1785 to resist usurpation of Indian lands, declaring that lands north and west of the Ohio River were Indian territory.  President [[George Washington]] directed the [[United States Army]] to enforce U.S. sovereignty over the territory. The U.S. Army, consisting mostly of untrained recruits and volunteer militiamen, suffered a series of major defeats, including the [[Harmar Campaign]] (1790) and [[St. Clair's Defeat]] (1791). About 1,000 soldiers and militiamen were killed and the United States forces suffered many more casualties than their opponents. These defeats are among the worst ever suffered in the [[History of the United States Army|history of the US Army]].\n\nAfter St. Clair's disaster, Washington ordered [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] hero General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] to organize and train a proper fighting force. Wayne took command of the new [[Legion of the United States]] late in 1792. After a methodical campaign up the Great Miami and Maumee river valleys in western Ohio Country, he led his men to a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] near the southwestern shore of [[Lake Erie]] (close to modern [[Toledo, Ohio]]) in 1794. Afterward he went on to establish [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] at the Miami capital of [[Kekionga]], the symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Indian Country. The defeated tribes were forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day [[Ohio]], in the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795. The [[Jay Treaty]] in the same year arranged for cessions of British Great Lakes outposts on the great U.S. territory.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Sixty Years' War}}\nControl of the area south of the [[Great Lakes]] and north of the [[Ohio River]] was contested for centuries.

In April 1786, a militia from [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] [[Battle of the Embarras River|attacked a village]] on the [[Embarras River (Illinois)|Embarras River]], forcing [[Piankeshaw]] to move farther away and consolidate near the [[Vermilion River (Wabash River)|Vermilion River]].  Over 400 Piankeshaw and [[Wea]] returned with a war party in July, but were persuaded not to attack Vincennes. That Autumn, Generals George Rogers Clark and [[Benjamin Logan]] led a two-pronged force of Kentucky militia in punitive raids against Native American villages to the north of the Ohio River.{{r|sword|pp=35\u201336}}  Clark's force, considered the primary expedition, set off in September and marched north along the Wabash River to Illinois country. He was hindered by logistical problems caused by low water on the river, and when he reached the mouth of the Vermilion River in October, he was beset by mutiny and mass desertion.  Clark returned with the remains of his force to Vincennes, his reputation in ruins.{{r|sword|p=37}}\n\nGeneral Logan, meanwhile, recruited and trained for his secondary force of Federal soldiers and mounted Kentucky [[Militia (United States)|militia]] against several Shawnee towns along the [[Mad River (Ohio)|Mad River]].  The Shawnee nation was divided in their response to the United States settlers, but the Kentucky settlers made no distinction between hostile and friendly villages.{{r|sword|p=36}}  The Shawnee villages along the Mad River were defended primarily by noncombatants while the warriors were hunting or raiding forts in Kentucky.  Logan burned the native towns and food supplies, and killed or captured numerous natives.  Against Logan's orders, Captain [[Hugh McGary]] murdered an elderly Shawnee chief named [[Moluntha]], who was considered friendly towards the United States and who had even hoisted a striped flag to welcome Logan's men.{{r|sword|pp=38\u201339}}  continued to 7 other villages, killing, torturing, or capturing dozens of villagers, including women and children, and plundering their goods, and burning their crops before returning to Kentucky.{{r|sword|p=40-41}}  Logan's raid devastated the Shawnee nation, who's survivors struggled that winter due to the destroyed harvests.  But it also united the Shawnee against the United States.  Reports of Logan's raid alarmed the confederate council in Detroit that November, and Shawnee raids into Kentucky were reported by December 1786.{{r|sword|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nNative American raids on both sides of the Ohio River resulted in increasing casualties.  During the mid- and late-1780s, American settlers south of the Ohio River in Kentucky and travelers on and north of the Ohio River suffered approximately 1,500 casualties.  Settlers retaliated with attacks on Indians.  In 1789, the new [[United States Secretary of War]] [[Henry Knox]] argued that Congress had provoked Native Americans by claiming possession of their territories.<ref>{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Harless |title=Native American Policy |url=https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/native-american-policy/ |website=George Washington's Mount Vernon |accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Harmar Campaign===\n{{Main|Harmar campaign}}\nIn 1790, the new [[President of the United States]] [[George Washington]] and Secretary of War Henry Knox ordered General [[Josiah Harmar]] to launch the [[Harmar campaign]], a major western offensive into the Shawnee and Miami country.

On 19 October, a scouting party of about 400 mixed forces under the command of Colonel [[John Hardin]] was lured into an ambush near the village of [[Le Gris]], losing 129 soldiers in one of two defeats that has been called [[Hardin's Defeat]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Harmar's Defeat |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=505 |accessdate=20 Jan 2009}}</ref>{{sfnp|Drake|1901|p=173-5}}  The following day, another scouting party under Ensign Phillip Hartshorn was ambushed, but Harmar did not move to assist them or recover their remains.  Finally, on 21 October 1790, a mixed party of militia and regulars under Colonel Hardin established attack positions on Kekionga and awaited reinforcements from General Harmar, which never came.

A Native American force of about 2,000 warriors, led by [[Little Turtle]] and [[Blue Jacket]], struck quickly. Surprising the Americans, they soon overran the poorly prepared perimeter. The barely trained recruits panicked and were slaughtered, along with many of their officers, who frantically tried to restore order and stop the rout.

Little Turtle, wary of Wayne and disappointed with the British, argued that they should negotiate peace with Wayne.  Blue Jacket mocked Little Turtle as a traitor and convinced the others that Wayne would be defeated, just as Harmar and St. Clair had been.  Little Turtle then relinquished leadership to Blue Jacket, stating that he would only be a follower.{{r|Hogeland|pp=337, 369}}  Three days later, on 16 August, a messenger returned with a response asking Wayne to pause at his currently location, stating \"You have only to write & your Business is done, but we Indians must do all our Business with every nation of the Confederacy which takes up a great deal of time.\"{{r|Gaff|pp=292\u2013293}}  Native American advisors told Wayne that many of the Confederation were ready to accept Wayne's offer of peace, but that Little Turtle had sent this response as a delay tactic needed to gather additional forces.{{r|Gaff|pp=292\u2013293}}  Wayne departed Fort Recovery the next day.

This late in the campaign, the Legion was reduced to about 3,000 soldiers and militia, with many soldiers defending the supply trains and forts.  [[Blue Jacket]], the Native alliance commander, had selected a battlefield where a tornado had felled hundreds of trees, creating a natural defensive barrier.<ref name=NMUSA>{{cite web |url=https://armyhistory.org/the-battle-of-fallen-timbers-20-august-1794/ |title=The Battle of Fallen Timbers, 20 August 1794 |last=Seelinger |first=Matthew |date=16 July 2014 |publisher=[[National Museum of the United States Army]] |accessdate=29 July 2019}}</ref>  Here, he placed confederation forces of about 1,500 warriors: Blue Jacket's Shawnees, Delawares led by [[Buckongahelas]], [[Miami tribe|Miamis]] led by [[Little Turtle]], [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]s led by [[Tarhe]]{{sfn|Stockwell|2018|p=264}} and [[Roundhead (Wyandot)|Roundhead]], [[Mingo]]s, a small detachment of [[Mohawks]], and a British company of Canadian militiamen dressed as Native Americans under LTC William Caldwell.{{r|sword|p=298}}  \n\n[[Odawa]] and [[Potawatomi]] under Little Otter and [[Egushawa]] occupied the center and initiated the attack against the Legion's scouts.  Front elements of the Legion's columns initially collapsed under pursuing Native Americans.  Wayne immediately committed his reserves to the center to halt their advance, and divided his infantry into two wings, the right commanded by James Wilkinson, the other by [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Hamtramck]]. The Legion's cavalry secured the right along the Maumee River.  General Scott provided a brigade of mounted militia to guard the open left flank, while the rest of the Kentucky militia formed a reserve.<ref name=NMUSA />  Once contact had been established, U.S. scouts identified the location of Confederacy warriors, and Wayne ordered an immediate bayonet charge.  Legion dragoons also charged and attacked with sabres.  Blue Jacket's warriors fled from the battlefield to regroup nearby [[Fort Miami (Ohio)|Fort Miami]], but found themselves locked out of the fort by the British occupants.  (Britain and the United States were by then reaching a close rapprochement to counter [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] [[Kingdom of France|France]] during the [[French Revolution]].)  The entire battle lasted little more than an hour.{{r|sword|p=306}}  The Legion had significant casualties, with 33 men killed and 100 wounded.  The Confederacy had between 19 and 40 warriors killed, and an unknown number wounded.{{r|Gaff|p=327}}  The battle fostered distrust between the native nations, and between the confederacy and the British; it was the last time the Western Confederacy gathered a large military force to oppose the United States.\n\nWayne's army encamped for three days in sight of Fort Miamis, under command of Major [[William Campbell (British Army officer and Governor)|William Campbell]].  When Major Campbell asked the meaning of the encampment, Wayne replied that the answer had already been given by the sound of their muskets and the retreat of the Indians.{{r|Hogeland|p=350}}  The next day, Wayne rode alone to Fort Miamis and slowly conducted an inspection of the fort's exterior walls.  The British garrison debated whether or not to engage the General, but in the absence of orders and being already at war with France, Major Campbell declined to fire the first shot at the United States.{{r|Hogeland|pp=350\u2013351}}  The Legion, meanwhile, destroyed Indian villages and crops in the region of Fort Deposit, and burned Alexander McKee's trading post within sight of Fort Miamis before withdrawing.{{r|Hogeland|p=351}}\n\nWayne's Legion finally arrived at [[Kekionga]] on 17 September 1794, and Wayne personally selected the site for a new U.S. fort.<ref name=Poinsatte>{{cite book |last=Poinsatte |first=Charles |title=Outpost in the Wilderness: Fort Wayne, 1706\u20131828 |publisher=Allen County, Fort Wayne Historical Society |year=1976 |pages=27\u201328}}</ref>  Wayne wanted a strong fort built, capable of withstanding not only an Indian uprising, but a possible attack by the British from Fort Detroit.

'''Northwest Indian War''' (1785\u20131795), also known as the '''Ohio War''', '''Little Turtle's War''', and by other names, was a war between the [[United States]] and a confederation of numerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, with support from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], for control of the [[Northwest Territory]]. It followed centuries of conflict over this territory, first among Native American tribes, and then with the added shifting alliances among the tribes and the European powers of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Great Britain]], and their colonials. The [[United States Army]] considers it their first of the [[American Indian Wars|United States Indian Wars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.army.mil/html/reference/army_flag/iw.html |title=Indian Wars Campaigns |website=U.S. Army Center of Military History |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nUnder the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], Great Britain ceded to the U.S. \"control\" of what were known as the Ohio Country and the Illinois Country, which were occupied by numerous Native American peoples. Despite the treaty, the British kept forts there and continued policies that supported the Native Americans. With the encroachment of European settlers west of the Appalachians after the War, a Huron-led confederacy formed in 1785 to resist usurpation of Indian lands, declaring that lands north and west of the Ohio River were Indian territory.  President [[George Washington]] directed the [[United States Army]] to enforce U.S. sovereignty over the territory. The U.S. Army, consisting mostly of untrained recruits and volunteer militiamen, suffered a series of major defeats, including the [[Harmar Campaign]] (1790) and [[St. Clair's Defeat]] (1791). About 1,000 soldiers and militiamen were killed and the United States forces suffered many more casualties than their opponents. These defeats are among the worst ever suffered in the [[History of the United States Army|history of the US Army]].\n\nAfter St. Clair's disaster, Washington ordered [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] hero General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] to organize and train a proper fighting force. Wayne took command of the new [[Legion of the United States]] late in 1792. After a methodical campaign up the Great Miami and Maumee river valleys in western Ohio Country, he led his men to a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] near the southwestern shore of [[Lake Erie]] (close to modern [[Toledo, Ohio]]) in 1794. Afterward he went on to establish [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] at the Miami capital of [[Kekionga]], the symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Indian Country. The defeated tribes were forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day [[Ohio]], in the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795. The [[Jay Treaty]] in the same year arranged for cessions of British Great Lakes outposts on the great U.S. territory.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Sixty Years' War}}\nControl of the area south of the [[Great Lakes]] and north of the [[Ohio River]] was contested for centuries.

In April 1786, a militia from [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] [[Battle of the Embarras River|attacked a village]] on the [[Embarras River (Illinois)|Embarras River]], forcing [[Piankeshaw]] to move farther away and consolidate near the [[Vermilion River (Wabash River)|Vermilion River]].  Over 400 Piankeshaw and [[Wea]] returned with a war party in July, but were persuaded not to attack Vincennes. That Autumn, Generals George Rogers Clark and [[Benjamin Logan]] led a two-pronged force of Kentucky militia in punitive raids against Native American villages to the north of the Ohio River.{{r|sword|pp=35\u201336}}  Clark's force, considered the primary expedition, set off in September and marched north along the Wabash River to Illinois country. He was hindered by logistical problems caused by low water on the river, and when he reached the mouth of the Vermilion River in October, he was beset by mutiny and mass desertion.  Clark returned with the remains of his force to Vincennes, his reputation in ruins.{{r|sword|p=37}}\n\nGeneral Logan, meanwhile, recruited and trained for his secondary force of Federal soldiers and mounted Kentucky [[Militia (United States)|militia]] against several Shawnee towns along the [[Mad River (Ohio)|Mad River]].  The Shawnee nation was divided in their response to the United States settlers, but the Kentucky settlers made no distinction between hostile and friendly villages.{{r|sword|p=36}}  The Shawnee villages along the Mad River were defended primarily by noncombatants while the warriors were hunting or raiding forts in Kentucky.  Logan burned the native towns and food supplies, and killed or captured numerous natives.  Against Logan's orders, Captain [[Hugh McGary]] murdered an elderly Shawnee chief named [[Moluntha]], who was considered friendly towards the United States and who had even hoisted a striped flag to welcome Logan's men.{{r|sword|pp=38\u201339}}  continued to 7 other villages, killing, torturing, or capturing dozens of villagers, including women and children, and plundering their goods, and burning their crops before returning to Kentucky.{{r|sword|p=40-41}}  Logan's raid devastated the Shawnee nation, who's survivors struggled that winter due to the destroyed harvests.  But it also united the Shawnee against the United States.  Reports of Logan's raid alarmed the confederate council in Detroit that November, and Shawnee raids into Kentucky were reported by December 1786.{{r|sword|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nNative American raids on both sides of the Ohio River resulted in increasing casualties.  During the mid- and late-1780s, American settlers south of the Ohio River in Kentucky and travelers on and north of the Ohio River suffered approximately 1,500 casualties.  Settlers retaliated with attacks on Indians.  In 1789, the new [[United States Secretary of War]] [[Henry Knox]] argued that Congress had provoked Native Americans by claiming possession of their territories.<ref>{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Harless |title=Native American Policy |url=https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/native-american-policy/ |website=George Washington's Mount Vernon |accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Harmar Campaign===\n{{Main|Harmar campaign}}\nIn 1790, the new [[President of the United States]] [[George Washington]] and Secretary of War Henry Knox ordered General [[Josiah Harmar]] to launch the [[Harmar campaign]], a major western offensive into the Shawnee and Miami country.

A Native American force of about 2,000 warriors, led by [[Little Turtle]] and [[Blue Jacket]], struck quickly. Surprising the Americans, they soon overran the poorly prepared perimeter. The barely trained recruits panicked and were slaughtered, along with many of their officers, who frantically tried to restore order and stop the rout.

The Legion's cavalry secured the right along the Maumee River.  General Scott provided a brigade of mounted militia to guard the open left flank, while the rest of the Kentucky militia formed a reserve.<ref name=NMUSA />  Once contact had been established, U.S. scouts identified the location of Confederacy warriors, and Wayne ordered an immediate bayonet charge.  Legion dragoons also charged and attacked with sabres.

The entire battle lasted little more than an hour.{{r|sword|p=306}}  The Legion had significant casualties, with 33 men killed and 100 wounded.  The Confederacy had between 19 and 40 warriors killed, and an unknown number wounded.{{r|Gaff|p=327}}  The battle fostered distrust between the native nations, and between the confederacy and the British; it was the last time the Western Confederacy gathered a large military force to oppose the United States.\n\nWayne's army encamped for three days in sight of Fort Miamis, under command of Major [[William Campbell (British Army officer and Governor)|William Campbell]].

Sewers, Sewres, Great Stink\n==Early life==\nBazalgette was born in Hill Lodge, Clay Hill, [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], London, the son of Joseph William Bazalgette (1783\u20131849), a retired [[Royal Navy]] captain, and Theresa Philo, born Pilton (1796\u20131850), and was the grandson of a French Protestant immigrant. \n\nHe began his career working on railway projects, articled to noted engineer [[John Benjamin Macneill|Sir John MacNeill]] and gaining sufficient experience (some in China) in land drainage and [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] works for him to set up his own London consulting practice in 1842. By the time he married his wife, Maria Kough, in 1845, Bazalgette was deeply involved in the expansion of the railway network, working so hard that he suffered a nervous breakdown two years later.\n\nWhile he was recovering, London's [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]] ordered that all [[cesspit]]s should be closed and that house drains should connect to sewers and empty into the Thames. As a result, a cholera epidemic (1848\u201349) killed 14,137&nbsp;Londoners.\n\nBazalgette was appointed assistant surveyor to the Commission in 1849, taking over as Engineer in 1852, after his predecessor died of \"harassing fatigues and anxieties.\" Soon after, another cholera epidemic struck, in 1853, killing 10,738. Medical opinion at the time held that cholera was caused by foul air: a so-called ''[[Miasma theory|miasma]]''. Physician [[John Snow (physician)|Dr John Snow]] had earlier advanced a different explanation, which is now known to be correct: cholera was spread by contaminated water. His view was not then generally accepted.\n\nChampioned by fellow engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], Bazalgette was appointed chief engineer of the Commission's successor, the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]], in 1856 (a post which he retained until the MBW was abolished and replaced by the [[London County Council]] in 1889). In 1858, the year of the [[Great Stink]], Parliament passed an enabling act, in spite of the colossal expense of the project, and Bazalgette's proposals to revolutionise London's sewerage system began to be implemented. The expectation was that enclosed sewers would eliminate the stink ('miasma'), and that this would then reduce the incidence of cholera.\n\n==Sewer works==\n\n[[File:Abbey Mills Pumping Station3.jpg|right|thumb|The old [[Abbey Mills Pumping Station]]]]\n[[File:The Octagon, Crossness Pumping Station.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the Octagon at [[Crossness Pumping Station]] showing its elaborate decorative ironwork]]\n[[File:ICE editathon - One Great George Street - 19 July 2013 61 Bazalgette reports.jpg|thumb|Drainage reports by Bazalgette in the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]]' archives]]\n\nAt that time, the River Thames was little more than an open sewer, empty of any fish or other wildlife, and an obvious health hazard to Londoners. \n\nBazalgette's solution (similar to a proposal made by painter [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] 25 years earlier) was to construct a network of {{convert|82|mi|km}} of enclosed underground brick main sewers to intercept sewage outflows, and {{convert|1100|mi|km}} of street [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, to intercept the raw sewage which up until then flowed freely through the streets and thoroughfares of London. \n\nThe plan included major [[pumping station]]s at [[Deptford pumping station|Deptford]] (1864) and at [[Crossness Pumping Station|Crossness]] (1865) on the [[Erith]] marshes, both on the south side of the Thames, and at [[Abbey Mills Pumping Station|Abbey Mills]] (in the [[River Lea]] valley, 1868) and on the [[Chelsea Embankment]] (close to [[Grosvenor Bridge]]; 1875), north of the river. The outflows were diverted downstream where they were collected in two large sewage outfall systems on the north and south sides of the Thames called the [[Northern Outfall Sewer|Northern]] and [[Southern Outfall Sewer|Southern Outfall sewers]]. The sewage from the [[Northern Outfall Sewer|Northern Outfall sewer]] and that from the [[Southern Outfall Sewer|Southern Outfall]] were originally collected in balancing tanks in [[Beckton]] and [[Crossness]], respectively, before being dumped, untreated, into the Thames at high tide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crossness.org.uk/history/londons-sanitation/how-the-system-worked.html|title=How the system worked|website=Crossness Engines|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002054419/http://www.crossness.org.uk/history/londons-sanitation/how-the-system-worked.html#|archive-date=2 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe system was opened by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] in 1865, although the whole project was not actually completed for another ten years.\n\nPartly as a result of the [[SS Princess Alice (1865)|Princess Alice disaster]], extensive [[sewage treatment]] facilities were built to replace the balancing tanks in [[Beckton]] and [[Crossness]] in 1900.\n\nBazalgette's foresight may be seen in the diameter of the sewers. When planning the network he took the densest population, gave every person the most generous allowance of sewage production and came up with a diameter of pipe needed. He then said 'Well, we're only going to do this once and there's always the unforeseen' and doubled the diameter to be used. His foresight allowed for the unforeseen increase in population density with the introduction of the [[tower block]]; with the original, smaller pipe diameter the sewer would have overflowed in the 1960s, rather than coping until the present day as it has.\n\nThe [[unintended consequence]] of the new sewer system was to eliminate cholera everywhere in the water system, whether or not it stank.  The basic premise of this expensive project, that [[Miasma theory|miasma]] spread cholera infection, was wrong.  However, instead of causing the project to fail, the new sewers succeeded in virtually eliminating the disease by removing the contamination. Bazalgette's sewers also decreased the incidence of [[typhus]] and [[typhoid]] epidemics.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/03/12/392332431/|title='Dirty Old London': A History of the Victorians' Infamous Filth|date=12 March 2015|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=13 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623171517/http://www.npr.org/2015/03/12/392332431/dirty-old-london-a-history-of-the-victorians-infamous-filth|archive-date=23 June 2017|url-status=live|quote=[the famous great sewer network of the mid-19th century] basically took away the possibility of wholesale cholera epidemics in the city, typhus and typhoid \u2013 they all were reduced.}}</ref>\n\nBazalgette's capacity for hard work was remarkable; every connection to the sewerage system by the various Vestry Councils had to be checked and Bazalgette did this himself and the records contain thousands of [[Drafting linen|linen plans]] with handwritten comments in Indian ink on them \"Approved JWB\", \"I do not like 6''\"'' used here and 9''\"'' should be used.
