It stars [[Matt Lanter]], [[Vanessa Minnillo]], Gary \"G Thang\" Johnson, [[Crista Flanagan]], [[Nicole Parker]], [[Ike Barinholtz]], [[Carmen Electra]], [[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]], and [[Kim Kardashian]] in her feature film debut. Released on August 29, 2008 by [[Lionsgate]], the film is a parody of the [[disaster film]] genre and [[pop culture]]. \n\nThe film was panned by critics and audiences for its forced humor, excessive references and poor directing, with many considering it to be worse than the previous movies created by Seltzer and Friedberg,<ref name=\"CinemaScore\" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/09/25/decades.worst.movies.tomatoes/ | title=Site picks worst movies of the decade | work=CNN | date=September 25, 2009 | accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> as well as [[List of films considered the worst|one of the worst films of all time]].

After defeating him, the caveman then encounters the predator, a [[Saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed]], [[gasoline]]-drinking [[Amy Winehouse]] ([[Nicole Parker]]), who informs him that the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|world will end]] on August 29, 2008 and that their fate lies in a [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|Crystal Skull]]. The sequence is then revealed to be a dream of [[everyman]] Will ([[Matt Lanter]]) in the present day. He then finds out that his girlfriend Amy ([[Vanessa Minnillo]]) is having an affair with [[Flavor Flav]] (Abe Spigner), and she breaks up with Will because he is not admitting his true feelings for her.\n\nLater that day, Will has a \"[[My Super Sweet 16|Super Duper Sweet Sixteen]]\" party at his house, despite being 25. The guests include [[Juno (film)|Juney]] ([[Crista Flanagan]]), [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]] (John Di Domenico), Will's best friend Calvin (Gary \"G Thang\" Johnson), and [[Anton Chigurh]] (Barinholtz), among others. During the party, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, a [[Calvin Klein]] underwear model. The party then comes to a halt when the room shakes and the lights go out. A bulletin on the radio claims there is a [[meteor shower]] and it is the end of the world. Soon after, the city starts to [[The Day After Tomorrow|freeze over]], and Will, Juney, Calvin, and Calvin's girlfriend Lisa ([[Kim Kardashian]]) retreat to a garage for shelter. When Juney mentions that the calamities are caused by [[global warming]], Will realizes his dream as a caveman could be related. Later, Will is chided by the others for not committing himself to his relationship with Amy.\n\nThe gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, where he admits his feelings for her before the call is dropped. He decides to go to rescue Amy. Lisa is later killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, [[Giselle (Disney)|Giselle]] (Parker), a prostitute, climbs out of a [[manhole]] and gets hit by a [[Taxicab|taxi]]. Calvin catches her, and they [[Love at first sight|immediately fall in love with each other]]. Giselle's [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], [[Enchanted (2007 film)|Prince Edwin]] ([[Tad Hilgenbrink]]), challenges Calvin to [[Step Up 2: The Streets|a dance fight]] for her love, but [[Twister (1996 film)|a tornado]] appears and Prince Edwin escapes. [[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]] (Gerrard Fachinni), [[Hellboy]] (Barinholtz), and [[The Incredible Hulk (film)|the Hulk]] ([[Roland Kickinger]]) attempt to fight it, but all are defeated by [[Cattle|cows]] thrown by the tornado. After taking shelter, Will, Juney, Calvin, and Giselle encounter [[Rabies|rabid]] knockoffs of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]], who attack the gang and kill Juney. The \"Chipmunks\" then go after Will and Calvin, but they trap them in a trash can, fatally suffocating them as they attempt to escape.\n\nOn their way to the museum where Amy is trapped, the group runs into [[Batman]], who informs them that they must go to evacuation buses and that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. With time against them, Princess Giselle kills [[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]] (Jared S. Eddo), and the group hijacks his [[Mach Five]] to drive to the museum. At the museum, they save Amy, who reveals that the Crystal Skull is the only thing that can stop the end of the world. Calvin and the Princess then find that the museum doors are closed and all of the artifacts have [[Night at the Museum|come alive]], including [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po from Kung Fu Panda]] (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin but is defeated. When Calvin makes out with the Princess, Calvin accidentally pulls her [[wig]] and discovers that she is actually a [[Transvestism|transvestite]]. While this happens, \"Po\" takes out a [[katana]] and simultaneously kills Calvin and the Princess.\n\nMeanwhile, Will and Amy run into a nude [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]] (Barinholtz), who fights with Will. After Amy stabs \"Beowulf\" in the back, Will and Amy encounter [[Indiana Jones]] ([[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]]), who is revealed to be Will's father. \"Indy\" tries to put the Crystal Skull on the altar, but he flys through a stained glass window in the room. Will does it instead, and he averts further destruction. Will and Amy have a [[wedding]] ceremony performed by [[The Love Guru|\"The Guru Shitka\"]] (Domenico), it then goes to an extensive musical number about all of the characters dating each other (fucking in the unrated version) parodying \"I'm Fucking Matt Damon\" by Sarah Silverman. The film ends with the \"Chipmunks\" getting crushed to death by a falling cow.\n\n== Parodies ==\n{{unrefsec|date=February 2020}}\n=== Films and TV shows ===\n<!-- DO NOT ADD AN ITEM WITHOUT A CITATION TO A RELIABLE SOURCE.

After defeating him, the caveman then encounters the predator, a [[Saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed]], [[gasoline]]-drinking [[Amy Winehouse]] ([[Nicole Parker]]), who informs him that the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|world will end]] on August 29, 2008 and that their fate lies in a [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|Crystal Skull]]. The sequence is then revealed to be a dream of [[everyman]] Will ([[Matt Lanter]]) in the present day. He then finds out that his girlfriend Amy ([[Vanessa Minnillo]]) is having an affair with [[Flavor Flav]] (Abe Spigner), and she breaks up with Will because he is not admitting his true feelings for her.\n\nLater that day, Will has a \"[[My Super Sweet 16|Super Duper Sweet Sixteen]]\" party at his house, despite being 25. The guests include [[Juno (film)|Juney]] ([[Crista Flanagan]]), [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]] (John Di Domenico), Will's best friend Calvin (Gary \"G Thang\" Johnson), and [[Anton Chigurh]] (Barinholtz), among others. During the party, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, a [[Calvin Klein]] underwear model. The party then comes to a halt when the room shakes and the lights go out. A bulletin on the radio claims there is a [[meteor shower]] and it is the end of the world. Soon after, the city starts to [[The Day After Tomorrow|freeze over]], and Will, Juney, Calvin, and Calvin's girlfriend Lisa ([[Kim Kardashian]]) retreat to a garage for shelter. When Juney mentions that the calamities are caused by [[global warming]], Will realizes his dream as a caveman could be related. Later, Will is chided by the others for not committing himself to his relationship with Amy.\n\nThe gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, where he admits his feelings for her before the call is dropped. He decides to go to rescue Amy. Lisa is later killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, [[Giselle (Disney)|Giselle]] (Parker), a prostitute, climbs out of a [[manhole]] and gets hit by a [[Taxicab|taxi]]. Calvin catches her, and they [[Love at first sight|immediately fall in love with each other]]. Giselle's [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], [[Enchanted (2007 film)|Prince Edwin]] ([[Tad Hilgenbrink]]), challenges Calvin to [[Step Up 2: The Streets|a dance fight]] for her love, but [[Twister (1996 film)|a tornado]] appears and Prince Edwin escapes. [[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]] (Gerrard Fachinni), [[Hellboy]] (Barinholtz), and [[The Incredible Hulk (film)|the Hulk]] ([[Roland Kickinger]]) attempt to fight it, but all are defeated by [[Cattle|cows]] thrown by the tornado. After taking shelter, Will, Juney, Calvin, and Giselle encounter [[Rabies|rabid]] knockoffs of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]], who attack the gang and kill Juney. The \"Chipmunks\" then go after Will and Calvin, but they trap them in a trash can, fatally suffocating them as they attempt to escape.\n\nOn their way to the museum where Amy is trapped, the group runs into [[Batman]], who informs them that they must go to evacuation buses and that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. With time against them, Princess Giselle kills [[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]] (Jared S. Eddo), and the group hijacks his [[Mach Five]] to drive to the museum. At the museum, they save Amy, who reveals that the Crystal Skull is the only thing that can stop the end of the world. Calvin and the Princess then find that the museum doors are closed and all of the artifacts have [[Night at the Museum|come alive]], including [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po from Kung Fu Panda]] (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin but is defeated. When Calvin makes out with the Princess, Calvin accidentally pulls her [[wig]] and discovers that she is actually a [[Transvestism|transvestite]]. While this happens, \"Po\" takes out a [[katana]] and simultaneously kills Calvin and the Princess.\n\nMeanwhile, Will and Amy run into a nude [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]] (Barinholtz), who fights with Will. After Amy stabs \"Beowulf\" in the back, Will and Amy encounter [[Indiana Jones]] ([[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]]), who is revealed to be Will's father. \"Indy\" tries to put the Crystal Skull on the altar, but he flys through a stained glass window in the room. Will does it instead, and he averts further destruction. Will and Amy have a [[wedding]] ceremony performed by [[The Love Guru|\"The Guru Shitka\"]] (Domenico), it then goes to a extensive musical number about all of the characters dating each other (fucking in the unrated version) parodying \"I'm Fucking Matt Damon\" by Sarah Silverman. The film ends with the \"Chipmunks\" getting crushed to death by a falling cow.\n\n== Parodies ==\n{{unrefsec|date=February 2020}}\n=== Films and TV shows ===\n<!-- DO NOT ADD AN ITEM WITHOUT A CITATION TO A RELIABLE SOURCE.

It is likely that [[Attila the Hun]] started his attacks here against the Roman fortress which may have been at [[Sz\u00e1zhalombatta]]. The occupying Hungarians from East Asia used Csepel Island as a summer retreat, and [[Sz\u0151l\u0151s]], [[H\u00e1ros]] and [[T\u00f6k\u00f6l]] grew into settlements over time.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the population of Hal\u00e1sztelek numbered no more than fifty.\n\nThe settlement was named after [[Ern\u0151 Warmann]]'s sister and was called Herminamajor (\"Hermina's field\") or Herminatelep (\"Hermina's land\"). The next owner was P\u00e1l S\u00e1ndor who grew melons. As agriculture became more developed, the population started to increase and in 1920 it reached 254 people. Not much later, the settlement had new owners in the Malonyay family, whose castle was famed for its balls. During the world economic crisis of the 1930s the family went bankrupt and workers and Bulgarian families started to buy parts of their estate (which is why signs at the city limits are in both [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Latin alphabet]]s). After these sales of the estate, the castle's value was greatly reduced, and [[Istv\u00e1n F\u00fczessy]] became its owner. It is said that he lost the castle in a card game to [[Emil Stein]]. Stein planted peach orchards, and the land around the castle is still known as such, even though the land is now used for housing.\n\nAfter [[World War II]] the population rapidly increased, especially with migration from [[{{Hungarian county name|Zala}}]], [[{{Hungarian county name|Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg}}]], [[{{Hungarian county name|J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok}}]] and [[{{Hungarian county name|Hajd\u00fa-Bihar}}]]. In 1949, the population was 1,401.\n\nFrom 1 May 1950 the settlement became an independent village ({{lang-hu|k\u00f6zs\u00e9g}}) called Herminatelep.  In 1951 it changed to its current name of Hal\u00e1sztelek. Around that time the population was around 1,500, but its proximity to Budapest had the population double by 1955.\n\nFrom the 1970s, with the population increase, the settlement became more modernized and 70% of all properties had mains water and electricity. During this time the telephone network was also introduced to the area.\n\nOn 1 July 2008 Hal\u00e1sztelek got status as a city.\n\n==Transport==\nThe [[M0 motorway (Hungary)|M0]] leads to Hal\u00e1sztelek from [[Lakihegy]].\n\nThe transport infrastructure started to develop from the 1950s, and the [[Budapesti K\u00f6zleked\u00e9si Zrt.|BKV]] {{lang|hu|Budapesti K\u00f6zleked\u00e9si V\u00e1llalat}}, \"Mass Transport Company of Budapest\" started to run one bus route, increasing to three in the 1960s.

The name of ''Arminius'' is in fact from a stem  ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/ermunaz|ermen-]]'' \"strong\". Conflation of this element with the name ''Herman'' may indeed date to the medieval period, via variant forms such as ''Ermin, Ermen, Erman, Ermanno'', feminine ''Ermina, Ermana, Hirmina, Hermena''.<ref>E.

[[Hermine (disambiguation)|Hermine]] is the feminine form of ''Herman''.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/hermine Behind the Name]</ref>\nIt is first recorded in the 8th century, in the forms ''Hariman, Heriman, Hairman, Herman''.<ref>E.

The name of ''Arminius'' is in fact from a stem  ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/ermunaz|ermen-]]'' \"strong\". Conflation of this element with the name ''Herman'' may indeed date to the medieval period, via variant forms such as ''Ermin, Ermen, Erman, Ermanno'', feminine ''Ermina, Ermana, Hirmina, Hermena''.<ref>E.

Lee]]. It was produced by [[40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks]], with Lee's cousin, [[Spike Lee]], serving as producer. The film stars [[Taye Diggs]] and [[Nia Long]]. The film also served as the debut of [[Regina Hall]]. A Christmas-themed sequel, ''[[The Best Man Holiday]]'', was released on November 15, 2013 with a reunited cast.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Chicago]], Harper ([[Taye Diggs]]) is an up-and-coming author whose debut novel, ''Unfinished Business'', has been selected by [[Oprah's Book Club]]. Harper's devoted girlfriend Robyn ([[Sanaa Lathan]]) is frustrated by his unwillingness to commit to her.\n\nHarper travels to [[New York City]] to spend the weekend with old friends from college, before they all attend the wedding of Lance ([[Morris Chestnut]]), a [[running back]] for the [[New York Giants]], and Mia ([[Monica Calhoun]]). Serving as [[best man]], Harper reunites with his friends Murch ([[Harold Perrineau]]) and Jordan ([[Nia Long]]), who has passed an advanced copy of ''Unfinished Business'' around their inner circle of friends \u2013 upon whom the book is based.\n\nNone of the friends approve of Murch's domineering girlfriend Shelby ([[Melissa De Sousa]]), and Harper chastises Quentin ([[Terrance Howard]]) for being unable to settle down in a job. The weekend reveals that Quentin has always been a free spirit, Lance has renounced his womanizing ways, Harper is unsure about remaining a bachelor, and Murch has never been able to keep a secret. Flashbacks to their college days reveal that Lance met Mia through Harper, who almost slept with Jordan. Quentin antagonizes Lance about Mia, whom Lance believes has never been with another man. Learning Lance has a copy of his book, Harper worries he will discover that Harper and Mia had a [[one-night stand]] in college.\n\nConfronting Harper about their mutual attraction, Jordan admits she wants to have sex with him that night, before Robyn arrives for the wedding the next day, and they share a kiss. Lance confronts Harper in the bathroom, but merely thanks him for his friendship; they are interrupted before Harper can come clean. As the [[groomsman|groomsmen]] depart for the [[bachelor party]], Jordan invites Harper to meet her later, and Murch finally stands up to Shelby.\n\nAt the party, Harper steals Lance's copy of \"Unfinished Business\", to the disgust of Quentin, who has deduced Harper's secret. As the party gets increasingly drunk, Murch falls for one of the strippers, Candy ([[Regina Hall]]), and Harper calls Jordan, accepting her invitation. Finding the book in Harper's coat, Lance reads it, realizing that Mia slept with Harper in college to get back at Lance for his numerous infidelities. Enraged, Lance attacks Harper and almost throws him off the balcony, but Quentin talks him down, and Lance calls off the wedding.\n\nA badly beaten Harper arrives at Jordan's apartment. He blames her for circulating the book, but Jordan berates him for airing his own \u201cdirty laundry\u201d and leading her on. The next day, Harper meets Robyn at the airport. She notices his injuries, and Harper confesses everything. Disappointed in him, Robyn prepares to leave, but Harper declares how much he needs her, and she reluctantly agrees to help him save the wedding.\n\nArriving at the church with Candy, Murch breaks up with Shelby. Lance arrives, and his friends try desperately to stop him before he can tell his parents the wedding is off. Harper \u2013 who has never agreed with Lance's religious devotion \u2013 halts him by asking him to pray. While Robyn and Jordan tend to Mia, who is oblivious to the previous night's events, Harper begs for Lance's forgiveness and assures him of his and Mia's love. After forcing Harper to pray with him, a tearful Lance proceeds with the wedding.\n\nHarper gives a heartfelt speech praising Mia and Lance's love, earning his friends\u2019 forgiveness. Shelby pushes a bridesmaid out of the way to seize the [[Wedding superstitions#Catching the bouquet or garter|bouquet]], while Quentin catches the garter. Jordan finds closure with Harper, telling him Robyn is the woman for him. On the dance floor, Harper thanks Robyn for her help and, in front of the entire wedding party asks her to marry him; she says yes. The film ends as everyone dances the [[electric slide]].\n\nIn a post-credit scene, Shelby and Quentin wake up in bed together, to their shock and disgust.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Taye Diggs]] as Harper Stewart\n* [[Nia Long]] as Jordan Armstrong\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as Lance Sullivan\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Julian \"Murch\" Murchison\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Quentin Spivey\n* [[Sanaa Lathan]] as Robyn\n* [[Melissa De Sousa]] as Shelby\n* [[Monica Calhoun]] as Mia Morgan\n* [[Jim Moody (actor)|Jim Moody]] as Uncle Skeeter\n* [[Regina Hall]] as Candace \"Candy\" Sparks \n* [[Jarrod Bunch]] as Wayne\n* [[Victoria Dillard]] as Anita\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics. The film review website [[Allmovie]] gave the film 3/5 stars, with reviewer Jason Clark stating that while the film has \"occasional moments of ripe humor, but it fails to say anything new about troubled weddings or the  experience of being an upwardly mobile African-American looking for love.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Spike Lee |url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/the-best-man-180990/review |title=Allmovie Review |publisher=Allmovie.com |date=1999-10-22 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], the film averaged a favorable 61% rating from critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/bestman?q=The%20Best%20Man |title=The Best Man  |publisher=Metacritic |date=1999-10-22 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref> [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 72% positive rating based on reviews by 71 critics, with the site's consensus stating \"With a strong cast and a host of well-defined characters, The Best Man is an intelligent, funny romantic comedy that marks an impressive debut for writer/director Malcolm D.

[[Terrence Howard]]'s performance in particular earned much praise from many film critics, and in hindsight ''The Best Man'' is considered to be his breakout film. Later, he made the jump to other films and to the TV series [[Empire (2015 TV series)]]. Jason Clark in his Allmovie review even stated that although [[Taye Diggs]] does well in his first true starring role, Howard \"commands the screen with such abandon that one secretly wishes the film could have been all about his oddly captivating character\". All eight of the principal cast members received nominations for the film at the 2000 [[NAACP Image Awards]], with Howard and [[Nia Long]] winning. The film itself also won Outstanding Motion Picture.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Best Man - Music From The Motion Picture\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = October 12, 1999\n| recorded   = 1998-1999\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]\n| length     = 62:45\n| label      = [[Sony Music Entertainment]]\n| producer   = Bonnie Greenberg <small>([[executive producer#Music|exec.]])</small><br>Lisa Brown <small>([[executive producer#Music|exec.]])</small>\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = The Best Man - Music From The Motion Picture\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[Let's Not Play the Game]]\n | single1date = October 12, 1999\n | single2     = [[The Best Man I Can Be]]\n | single2date = October 29, 1999\n}}\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}} <ref>{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann |first=William |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r432383 |pure_url=yes}} |title=The Best Man - Original Soundtrack : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=1999-10-12 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref>\n}}\nThe film's soundtrack, released on October 12, 1999 by [[Sony Music Entertainment]], peaked at number 2 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts and number 16 on The Billboard 200 in 1999.\n<!-- see [[Template:Track listing]] to improve this section -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!#\n!Title\n!Performers\n!Time\n|-\n|1\n|\"What You Want\"\n|[[The Roots]] and [[Jaguar Wright|Jaguar]]\n|4:16\n|-\n|2\n|\"[[Let's Not Play the Game\"]]\n|[[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]]\n|4:32\n|-\n|3\n|\"After All Is Said and Done\"\n|[[Beyonc\u00e9]] and [[Marc Nelson]]\n|4:15\n|-\n|4\n|\"Poetry Girl\"\n|[[Eric Ben\u00e9t]]\n|5:29\n|-\n|5\n|\"Liar, Liar\"\n|[[LaTocha Scott]]\n|4:41\n|-\n|6\n|\"Best Man\"\n|[[Faith Evans]]\n|3:26\n|-\n|7\n|\"Beautiful Girl\"\n|[[Kenny Lattimore]]\n|4:04\n|-\n|8\n|\"Hit It Up\"\n|[[Sporty Thievz]]\n|3:39\n|-\n|9\n|\"[[Turn Your Lights Down Low]]\"\n|[[Bob Marley]] and [[Lauryn Hill]]\n|4:02\n|-\n|10\n|\"Untitled\"\n|[[Meshell Ndegeocello|Me'shell Ndegeocello]]\n|4:08\n|-\n|11\n|\"As My Girl\"\n|[[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]]\n|3:11\n|-\n|12\n|\"Wherever You Go\"\n|Sygnature and [[Simbi Khali]]\n|5:31\n|-\n|13\n|\"When the Shades Go Down\"\n|[[Allure (group)|Allure]]\n|4:56\n|-\n|14\n|\"[[The Best Man I Can Be]]\"\n|[[Ginuwine]], [[RL (singer)|RL]], [[Tyrese Gibson|Tyrese]] and [[Case (singer)|Case]]\n|6:29\n|}\n\n(*): Indicates songs were released as singles\n\n* The song playing during the scene where Harper and Jordan almost make love in college is \"[[As (song)|As]]\" by [[Stevie Wonder]], from his classic 1976 album ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]''.

Lee]]. It was produced by [[40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks]], with Lee's cousin, [[Spike Lee]], serving as producer. The film stars [[Taye Diggs]] and [[Nia Long]]. The film also served as the debut of [[Regina Hall]]. A Christmas-themed sequel, ''[[The Best Man Holiday]]'', was released on November 15, 2013 with a reunited cast.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Chicago]], Harper ([[Taye Diggs]]) is an up-and-coming author whose debut novel, ''Unfinished Business'', has been selected by [[Oprah's Book Club]]. Harper\u2019s devoted girlfriend Robyn ([[Sanaa Lathan]]) is frustrated by his unwillingness to commit to her.\n\nHarper travels to [[New York City]] to spend the weekend with old friends from college, before they all attend the wedding of Lance ([[Morris Chestnut]]), a [[running back]] for the [[New York Giants]], and Mia ([[Monica Calhoun]]). Serving as [[best man]], Harper reunites with his friends Murch ([[Harold Perrineau]]) and Jordan ([[Nia Long]]), who has passed an advanced copy of ''Unfinished Business'' around their inner circle of friends \u2013 upon whom the book is based.\n\nNone of the friends approve of Murch\u2019s domineering girlfriend Shelby ([[Melissa De Sousa]]), and Harper chastises Quentin ([[Terrance Howard]]) for being unable to settle down in a job. The weekend reveals that Quentin has always been a free spirit, Lance has renounced his womanizing ways, Harper is unsure about remaining a bachelor, and Murch has never been able to keep a secret. Flashbacks to their college days reveal that Lance met Mia through Harper, who almost slept with Jordan. Quentin antagonizes Lance about Mia, whom Lance believes has never been with another man. Learning Lance has a copy of his book, Harper worries he will discover that Harper and Mia had a [[one-night stand]] in college.\n\nConfronting Harper about their mutual attraction, Jordan admits she wants to have sex with him that night, before Robyn arrives for the wedding the next day, and they share a kiss. Lance confronts Harper in the bathroom, but merely thanks him for his friendship; they are interrupted before Harper can come clean. As the [[groomsman|groomsmen]] depart for the [[bachelor party]], Jordan invites Harper to meet her later, and Murch finally stands up to Shelby.\n\nAt the party, Harper steals Lance's copy of \"Unfinished Business\", to the disgust of Quentin, who has deduced Harper's secret. As the party gets increasingly drunk, Murch falls for one of the strippers, Candy ([[Regina Hall]]), and Harper calls Jordan, accepting her invitation. Finding the book in Harper\u2019s coat, Lance reads it, realizing that Mia slept with Harper in college to get back at Lance for his numerous infidelities. Enraged, Lance attacks Harper and almost throws him off the balcony, but Quentin talks him down, and Lance calls off the wedding.\n\nA badly beaten Harper arrives at Jordan\u2019s apartment. He blames her for circulating the book, but Jordan berates him for airing his own \u201cdirty laundry\u201d and leading her on. The next day, Harper meets Robyn at the airport. She notices his injuries, and Harper confesses everything. Disappointed in him, Robyn prepares to leave, but Harper declares how much he needs her, and she reluctantly agrees to help him save the wedding.\n\nArriving at the church with Candy, Murch breaks up with Shelby. Lance arrives, and his friends try desperately to stop him before he can tell his parents the wedding is off. Harper \u2013 who has never agreed with Lance\u2019s religious devotion \u2013 halts him by asking him to pray. While Robyn and Jordan tend to Mia, who is oblivious to the previous night\u2019s events, Harper begs for Lance\u2019s forgiveness and assures him of his and Mia\u2019s love. After forcing Harper to pray with him, a tearful Lance proceeds with the wedding.\n\nHarper gives a heartfelt speech praising Mia and Lance\u2019s love, earning his friends\u2019 forgiveness. Shelby pushes a bridesmaid out of the way to seize the [[Wedding superstitions#Catching the bouquet or garter|bouquet]], while Quentin catches the garter. Jordan finds closure with Harper, telling him Robyn is the woman for him. On the dance floor, Harper thanks Robyn for her help and, in front of the entire wedding party asks her to marry him; she says yes. The film ends as everyone dances the [[electric slide]].\n\nIn a post-credit scene, Shelby and Quentin wake up in bed together, to their shock and disgust.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Taye Diggs]] as Harper Stewart\n* [[Nia Long]] as Jordan Armstrong\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as Lance Sullivan\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Julian \"Murch\" Murchison\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Quentin Spivey\n* [[Sanaa Lathan]] as Robyn\n* [[Melissa De Sousa]] as Shelby\n* [[Monica Calhoun]] as Mia Morgan\n* [[Jim Moody (actor)|Jim Moody]] as Uncle Skeeter\n* [[Regina Hall]] as Candace \"Candy\" Sparks \n* [[Jarrod Bunch]] as Wayne\n* [[Victoria Dillard]] as Anita\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics. The film review website [[Allmovie]] gave the film 3/5 stars, with reviewer Jason Clark stating that while the film has \"occasional moments of ripe humor, but it fails to say anything new about troubled weddings or the  experience of being an upwardly mobile African-American looking for love.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Spike Lee |url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/the-best-man-180990/review |title=Allmovie Review |publisher=Allmovie.com |date=1999-10-22 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], the film averaged a favorable 61% rating from critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/bestman?q=The%20Best%20Man |title=The Best Man  |publisher=Metacritic |date=1999-10-22 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref> [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 72% positive rating based on reviews by 71 critics, with the site's consensus stating \"With a strong cast and a host of well-defined characters, The Best Man is an intelligent, funny romantic comedy that marks an impressive debut for writer/director Malcolm D.

He also wrote [[Modern Greek theatre|plays]], [[Travel writing|travel books]], memoirs and philosophical essays such as ''[[The Saviors of God|The Saviors of God: Spiritual Exercises]]''. His fame spread in the English-speaking world due to cinematic adaptations of ''[[Zorba the Greek (film)|Zorba the Greek]]'' (1964) and [[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|''The Last Temptation of Christ'']] (1988).\n\nHe translated also a number of notable works into [[Modern Greek]], such as the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' and the ''[[Iliad]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Nikos Kazantzakis 1904.jpg|thumb|Kazantzakis in 1904]]\n\nWhen Kazantzakis was born in 1883 in [[Heraklion|Kandiye]], now Heraklion, Crete had not yet joined [[Greece|the modern Greek state]] (which had been established in 1832), and was still under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. From 1902 to 1906 Kazantzakis studied law at the [[University of Athens]]: his 1906 [[Juris Doctor]] thesis title was ''\u039f \u03a6\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03af\u03c4\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2''<ref name=\"Biblionet\"/> (\"[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] on the Philosophy of Law and the State\"). Then he went to the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1907 to study philosophy. There he fell under the influence of [[Henri Bergson]]. His 1909 doctoral dissertation at the Sorbonne was a reworked version of his 1906 dissertation under the title ''Friedrich Nietzsche dans la philosophie du droit et de la cit\u00e9'' (\"Friedrich Nietzsche on the Philosophy of Right and the State\").<ref name=\"Biblionet\"/>  Upon his return to Greece, he began translating works of philosophy. In 1914 he met [[Angelos Sikelianos]]. Together they travelled for two years in places where Greek Orthodox Christian culture flourished, largely influenced by the enthusiastic nationalism of Sikelianos.\n\nKazantzakis married Galatea Alexiou in 1911; they divorced in 1926. He married Eleni Samiou in 1945. Between 1922 and his death in 1957, he sojourned in Paris and [[Berlin]] (from 1922 to 1924), Italy, Russia (in 1925), Spain (in 1932), and then later in [[Cyprus]], [[Aegina]], Egypt, [[Mount Sinai]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Nice]] (he later bought a villa in nearby [[Antibes]], in the Old Town section near the famed seawall), China, and Japan.\n\nWhile in Berlin, where the political situation was explosive, Kazantzakis discovered communism and became an admirer of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. He never became a committed communist, but visited the Soviet Union and stayed with the [[Left Opposition]] politician and writer [[Victor Serge]]. He witnessed the rise of [[Joseph Stalin]], and became disillusioned with Soviet-style communism. Around this time, his earlier nationalist beliefs were gradually replaced by a more universalist ideology.\nAs a journalist in 1926 he got interviews from [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and the Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]].\n\nThe 50th anniversary of the death of Nikos Kazantzakis was selected as main motif for a high-value euro collectors' coin; the \u20ac10 Greek [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2007 coinage|Nikos Kazantzakis commemorative coin]], minted in 2007. His image is on the obverse of the coin, while the reverse carries the [[National Emblem of Greece]] with his signature.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Grabmal von Nikos Kazantzakis-1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Epitaph on the grave of Kazantzakis in [[Heraklion]]. It reads ''\"I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free.\"'']]\n\nDuring WWII he was in Athens and translated the [[Iliad]], together with the philologist [[Ioannis Kakridis]]. In 1945, he became the leader of a small party on the non-communist left, and entered the Greek government as Minister without Portfolio. He resigned this post the following year. In 1946, The Society of Greek Writers recommended that Kazantzakis and [[Angelos Sikelianos]] be awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. In 1957, he lost the Prize to [[Albert Camus]] by one vote. Camus later said that Kazantzakis deserved the honour \"a hundred times more\" than himself.<ref>''The Philosophers' Magazine'', Issues 13\u201320, 2001 p. 120</ref> In total Kazantzakis was nominated in nine different years.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=4747 Nomination Database]</ref> Late in 1957, even though suffering from leukemia, he set out on one last trip to China and Japan. Falling ill on his return flight, he was transferred to [[Freiburg]], Germany, where he died. He is buried on the wall surrounding the city of [[Heraklion]] near the Chania Gate, because the [[Orthodox Church]] ruled out his being buried in a cemetery. His epitaph reads \"I hope for nothing. I fear nothing.

In 1907 Kazantzakis went to Paris for his graduate studies and was deeply influenced by the philosophy of [[Henri Bergson|Henry Bergson]], primarily the idea that a true understanding of the world comes from the combination of intuition, personal experience, and rational thought.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Nikos Kazantzakis, novelist|last=Peter.|first=Bien|date=1989|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|isbn=1853990337|location=Bristol|oclc=19353754}}</ref> The theme of rationalism mixed with irrationality later became central to many of Kazantzakis' later stories, characters, and personal philosophies. Later, in 1909, he wrote a one-act play titled ''Comedy'', which was filled with [[Existentialism|existential]] themes, predating the post-World War II existentialist movement in Europe spearheaded by writers like [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and Camus. After completing his studies in Paris, he wrote the tragedy, \"The Master Builder\" (\u039f \u03a0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2), based on a popular Greek folkloric myth.\n\n[[File:Kazantzakisloggia.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Medallion honoring Kazantzakis in the Venetian loggia of Heraklion]]\n\nThrough the next several decades, from the 1910s through the 1930s, Kazantzakis traveled around Greece, much of Europe, northern Africa, and to several countries in [[Asia]]. Countries he visited include: Germany, Italy, France, The Netherlands, Romania, Egypt, Russia, Japan, and China, among others. These journeys put Kazantzakis in contact with different philosophies, ideologies, lifestyles, and people, all of which influenced him and his writings.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The spiritual odyssey of Nikos Kazantzakis : a talk|last=Kimon.|first=Friar|date=1979|publisher=North Central Pub.

While he continued to travel later in life, the bulk of his travel writing came from this time period.\n\nKazantzakis began writing ''[[The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel]]'' in 1924, and completed it in 1938 after fourteen years of writing and revision.<ref name=\":1\" /> The poem follows the hero of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', Odysseus, as he undertakes a final journey after the end of the original poem. Following the structure of Homer's ''Odyssey'', it is divided into 24 rhapsodies and consists of 33,333 lines.<ref name=\":0\" /> While Kazantzakis felt this poem held his cumulative wisdom and experience, and that it was his greatest literary experience, critics were split, \"some praised it as an unprecedented epic, [while] many simply viewed it as a hybristic act,\" with many scholars still being split to this day.<ref name=\":1\" /> A common criticism of ''The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel'' was aimed at Kazantzakis' over-reliance on flowery and metaphorical verse, a criticism that is also aimed at his works of fiction.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMany of Kazantzakis' most famous novels were published between 1940 and 1961, including ''[[Zorba the Greek]]'' (1946), ''[[Christ Recrucified]]'' (1948), ''[[Captain Michalis]]'' (1953), ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1955), and ''[[Report to Greco]]'' (1961).\n\nScholar Peter Bein argues that each story explores different aspects of post-World War II Greek culture such as religion, nationalism, political beliefs, the [[Greek Civil War]], gender roles, immigration, and general cultural practices and beliefs.<ref name=\":0\" /> These works also explore what Kazantzakis believed to be the unique physical and spiritual location of Greece, a nation that belongs to neither the East nor the West, an idea he put forth in many of his letters to friends.<ref name=\":1\" /> As the scholar Peter Bein argued, \"Kazantzakis viewed Greece's special mission as the reconciliation of Eastern instinct with Western reason,\" echoing the Bergsonian themes that balance logic against emotion found in many of Kazantzakis' novels.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTwo of these works of fiction, ''[[Zorba the Greek]]'' and ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' had major motion picture adaptations in [[Zorba the Greek (film)|1964]] and [[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|1988]] respectively.[[File:2007 Greece 10 Euro Nikos Kazantzakis front.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2007 coinage|Nikos Kazantzakis commemorative coin]]]]\n\n== Language and use of Demotic Greek ==\nDuring the time when Kazantzakis was writing his novels, poems, and plays, the majority of \"serious\" Greek artistic work was written in [[Katharevousa]], a \"pure\" form of the Greek language that was created to bridge [[Ancient Greek]] with Modern, [[Demotic Greek]], and to \"purify\" Demotic Greek. The use of Demotic, among writers, gradually started to gain the upper hand only in the turn of the 20th century, under the influence of the [[New Athenian School]] (or Palamian).\n\nIn his letters to friends and correspondents, Kazantzakis wrote that he chose to write in Demotic Greek to capture the spirit of the people, and to make his writing resonate with the common Greek citizen.<ref name=\":0\" /> Moreover, he wanted to prove that the common spoken language of Greek was able to produce artistic, literary works. Or, in his own words, \"Why not show off all the possibilities of demotic Greek?\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Furthermore, Kazantzakis felt that it was important to record the vernacular of the everyday person, including Greek peasants, and often tried to include expressions, metaphors, and idioms he would hear while traveling throughout Greece, and incorporate them into his writing for posterity.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> At the time of writing, some scholars and critics panned his work because it was not written in Katharevousa, while others praised it precisely because it was written in Demotic Greek.\n\nSeveral critics have argued that Kazantakis' writing was too flowery, filled with obscure metaphors, and difficult to read, despite the fact that his works were written in Demotic Greek. Kazantzakis scholar Peter Bein argues that the metaphors and language Kazantzakis used were taken directly from the peasants he encountered when traveling Greece.<ref name=\":0\" /> Bein asserts that, since Kazantzakis was trying to preserve the language of the people, he used their local metahpors and phrases to give his narrative an air of authenticity and preserve these phrases so that they were not lost.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Socialism ==\nThroughout his life, Kazantzakis reiterated his belief that \"only socialism as the goal and democracy as the means\" could provide an equitable solution to the \"frightfully urgent problems of the age in which we are living.\"<ref name=\"Bien\">{{cite book |last1=Bien |first1=Peter |title=Kazantzakis: Politics of the Spirit, Volume 2 |date=1989 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=265\u2013266}}</ref> He saw the need for socialist parties throughout the world to put aside their bickering and unite so that the program of \"socialist democracy\" could prevail not just in Greece, but throughout the civilized world.<ref name=\"Bien\" /> He described socialism as a social system which \"does not permit the exploitation of one person by another\" and that \"must guarantee every freedom.\"<ref name=\"Bien\" />\n\nKazantzakis was anathema to the right-wing in Greece both before and after World War II.

As a young man he took a month long trip to [[Mount Athos]], a major spiritual center for Greek Orthodoxy.

In his book, ''Broken Hallelujah: Nikos Kazantzakis and Christian Theology'', author Darren Middleton theorizes that, \"Where the majority of Christian writers focus on God's immutability, Jesus' deity, and our salvation through God's grace, Kazantzakis emphasized divine mutability, Jesus' humanity, and God's own redemption through our effort,\" highlighting Kazantzakis' uncommon interpretation of traditional Orthodox Christian beliefs.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Middleton|first=Darren J.

He also wrote [[Modern Greek theatre|plays]], [[Travel writing|travel books]], memoirs and philosophical essays such as ''[[The Saviors of God|The Saviors of God: Spiritual Exercises]]''. His fame spread in the English-speaking world due to cinematic adaptations of ''[[Zorba the Greek (film)|Zorba the Greek]]'' (1964) and [[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|''The Last Temptation of Christ'']] (1988).\n\nHe translated also a number of notable works into [[Modern Greek]], such as the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' and the ''[[Iliad]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Nikos Kazantzakis 1904.jpg|thumb|Kazantzakis in 1904]]\n\nWhen Kazantzakis was born in 1883 in [[Heraklion|Kandiye]], now Heraklion, Crete had not yet joined [[Greece|the modern Greek state]] (which had been established in 1832), and was still under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. From 1902 to 1906 Kazantzakis studied law at the [[University of Athens]]: his 1906 [[Juris Doctor]] thesis title was ''\u039f \u03a6\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03af\u03c4\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2''<ref name=\"Biblionet\"/> (\"[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] on the Philosophy of Law and the State\"). Then he went to the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1907 to study philosophy. There he fell under the influence of [[Henri Bergson]]. His 1909 doctoral dissertation at the Sorbonne was a reworked version of his 1906 dissertation under the title ''Friedrich Nietzsche dans la philosophie du droit et de la cit\u00e9'' (\"Friedrich Nietzsche on the Philosophy of Right and the State\").<ref name=\"Biblionet\"/>  Upon his return to Greece, he began translating works of philosophy. In 1914 he met [[Angelos Sikelianos]]. Together they travelled for two years in places where Greek Orthodox Christian culture flourished, largely influenced by the enthusiastic nationalism of Sikelianos.\n\nKazantzakis married Galatea Alexiou in 1911; they divorced in 1926. He married Eleni Samiou in 1945. Between 1922 and his death in 1957, he sojourned in Paris and [[Berlin]] (from 1922 to 1924), Italy, Russia (in 1925), Spain (in 1932), and then later in [[Cyprus]], [[Aegina]], Egypt, [[Mount Sinai]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Nice]] (he later bought a villa in nearby [[Antibes]], in the Old Town section near the famed seawall), China, and Japan.\n\nWhile in Berlin, where the political situation was explosive, Kazantzakis discovered communism and became an admirer of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. He never became a committed communist, but visited the Soviet Union and stayed with the [[Left Opposition]] politician and writer [[Victor Serge]]. He witnessed the rise of [[Joseph Stalin]], and became disillusioned with Soviet-style communism. Around this time, his earlier nationalist beliefs were gradually replaced by a more universalist ideology.\nAs a journalist in 1926 he got interviews from [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and the Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]].\n\nThe 50th anniversary of the death of Nikos Kazantzakis was selected as main motif for a high-value euro collectors' coin; the \u20ac10 Greek [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2007 coinage|Nikos Kazantzakis commemorative coin]], minted in 2007. His image is on the obverse of the coin, while the reverse carries the [[National Emblem of Greece]] with his signature.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Grabmal von Nikos Kazantzakis-1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Epitaph on the grave of Kazantzakis in [[Heraklion]]. It reads ''\"I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free.\"'']]\n\nDuring WWII he was in Athens and translated the [[Iliad]], together with the philologist [[Ioannis Kakridis]]. In 1945, he became the leader of a small party on the non-communist left, and entered the Greek government as Minister without Portfolio. He resigned this post the following year. In 1946, The Society of Greek Writers recommended that Kazantzakis and [[Angelos Sikelianos]] be awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. In 1957, he lost the Prize to [[Albert Camus]] by one vote. Camus later said that Kazantzakis deserved the honour \"a hundred times more\" than himself.<ref>''The Philosophers' Magazine'', Issues 13\u201320, 2001 p. 120</ref> In total Kazantzakis was nominated in nine different years.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=4747 Nomination Database]</ref> Late in 1957, even though suffering from leukemia, he set out on one last trip to China and Japan. Falling ill on his return flight, he was transferred to [[Freiburg]], Germany, where he died. He is buried on the wall surrounding the city of [[Heraklion]] near the Chania Gate, because the [[Orthodox Church]] ruled out his being buried in a cemetery. His epitaph reads \"I hope for nothing. I fear nothing.

In 1907 Kazantzakis went to Paris for his graduate studies and was deeply influenced by the philosophy of [[Henri Bergson|Henry Bergson]], primarily the idea that a true understanding of the world comes from the combination of intuition, personal experience, and rational thought.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Nikos Kazantzakis, novelist|last=Peter.|first=Bien|date=1989|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|isbn=1853990337|location=Bristol|oclc=19353754}}</ref> The theme of rationalism mixed with irrationality later became central to many of Kazantzakis' later stories, characters, and personal philosophies. Later, in 1909, he wrote a one-act play titled ''Comedy'', which was filled with [[Existentialism|existential]] themes, predating the post-World War II existentialist movement in Europe spearheaded by writers like [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and Camus.

Countries he visited include: Germany, Italy, France, The Netherlands, Romania, Egypt, Russia, Japan, and China, among others.

While he continued to travel later in life, the bulk of his travel writing came from this time period.\n\nKazantzakis began writing ''[[The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel]]'' in 1924, and completed it in 1938 after fourteen years of writing and revision.<ref name=\":1\" /> The poem follows the hero of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', Odysseus, as he undertakes a final journey after the end of the original poem. Following the structure of Homer's ''Odyssey'', it is divided into 24 rhapsodies and consists of 33,333 lines.<ref name=\":0\" /> While Kazantzakis felt this poem held his cumulative wisdom and experience, and that it was his greatest literary experience, critics were split, \"some praised it as an unprecedented epic, [while] many simply viewed it as a hybristic act,\" with many scholars still being split to this day.<ref name=\":1\" /> A common criticism of ''The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel'' was aimed at Kazantzakis' over-reliance on flowery and metaphorical verse, a criticism that is also aimed at his works of fiction.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMany of Kazantzakis' most famous novels were published between 1940 and 1961, including ''[[Zorba the Greek]]'' (1946), ''[[Christ Recrucified]]'' (1948), ''[[Captain Michalis]]'' (1953), ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1955), and ''[[Report to Greco]]'' (1961).\n\nScholar Peter Bein argues that each story explores different aspects of post-World War II Greek culture such as religion, nationalism, political beliefs, the [[Greek Civil War]], gender roles, immigration, and general cultural practices and beliefs.<ref name=\":0\" /> These works also explore what Kazantzakis believed to be the unique physical and spiritual location of Greece, a nation that belongs to neither the East nor the West, an idea he put forth in many of his letters to friends.<ref name=\":1\" /> As the scholar Peter Bein argued, \"Kazantzakis viewed Greece's special mission as the reconciliation of Eastern instinct with Western reason,\" echoing the Bergsonian themes that balance logic against emotion found in many of Kazantzakis' novels.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTwo of these works of fiction, ''[[Zorba the Greek]]'' and ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' had major motion picture adaptations in [[Zorba the Greek (film)|1964]] and [[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|1988]] respectively.[[File:2007 Greece 10 Euro Nikos Kazantzakis front.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2007 coinage|Nikos Kazantzakis commemorative coin]]]]\n\n== Language and use of Demotic Greek ==\nDuring the time when Kazantzakis was writing his novels, poems, and plays, the majority of \"serious\" Greek artistic work was written in [[Katharevousa]], a \"pure\" form of the Greek language that was created to bridge [[Ancient Greek]] with Modern, [[Demotic Greek]], and to \"purify\" Demotic Greek. The use of Demotic, among writers, gradually started to gain the upper hand only in the turn of the 20th century, under the influence of the [[New Athenian School]] (or Palamian).\n\nIn his letters to friends and correspondents, Kazantzakis wrote that he chose to write in Demotic Greek to capture the spirit of the people, and to make his writing resonate with the common Greek citizen.<ref name=\":0\" /> Moreover, he wanted to prove that the common spoken language of Greek was able to produce artistic, literary works. Or, in his own words, \"Why not show off all the possibilities of demotic Greek?\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Furthermore, Kazantzakis felt that it was important to record the vernacular of the everyday person, including Greek peasants, and often tried to include expressions, metaphors, and idioms he would hear while traveling throughout Greece, and incorporate them into his writing for posterity.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> At the time of writing, some scholars and critics panned his work because it was not written in Katharevousa, while others praised it precisely because it was written in Demotic Greek.\n\nSeveral critics have argued that Kazantakis' writing was too flowery, filled with obscure metaphors, and difficult to read, despite the fact that his works were written in Demotic Greek. Kazantzakis scholar Peter Bein argues that the metaphors and language Kazantzakis used were taken directly from the peasants he encountered when traveling Greece.<ref name=\":0\" /> Bein asserts that, since Kazantzakis was trying to preserve the language of the people, he used their local metahpors and phrases to give his narrative an air of authenticity and preserve these phrases so that they were not lost.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Socialism ==\nThroughout his life, Kazantzakis reiterated his belief that \"only socialism as the goal and democracy as the means\" could provide an equitable solution to the \"frightfully urgent problems of the age in which we are living.\"<ref name=\"Bien\">{{cite book |last1=Bien |first1=Peter |title=Kazantzakis: Politics of the Spirit, Volume 2 |date=1989 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=265\u2013266}}</ref> He saw the need for socialist parties throughout the world to put aside their bickering and unite so that the program of \"socialist democracy\" could prevail not just in Greece, but throughout the civilized world.<ref name=\"Bien\" /> He described socialism as a social system which \"does not permit the exploitation of one person by another\" and that \"must guarantee every freedom.\"<ref name=\"Bien\" /> \n\nKazantzakis was anathema to the right-wing in Greece both before and after World War II.

As a young man he took a month long trip to [[Mount Athos]], a major spiritual center for Greek Orthodoxy. Most critics and scholars of Kazantzakis agree that the struggle to find truth in religion and spirituality was central to a great deal of his works, and that some novels, like ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' and ''[[Christ Recrucified]]'' focus completely on questioning Christian morals and values.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Broken hallelujah : Nikos Kazantzakis and Christian theology|last=1966-|first=Middleton, Darren J.

In his book, ''Broken Hallelujah: Nikos Kazantzakis and Christian Theology'', author Darren Middleton theorizes that, \"Where the majority of Christian writers focus on God's immutability, Jesus' deity, and our salvation through God's grace, Kazantzakis emphasized divine mutability, Jesus' humanity, and God's own redemption through our effort,\" highlighting Kazantzakis' uncommon interpretation of traditional Orthodox Christian beliefs.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Middleton|first=Darren J.
