Its formal name, painted on its outer wall, was '''National League Park'''. It was also initially known as '''Philadelphia Park''' or '''Philadelphia Base Ball Grounds / Park'''.\n\nBaker Bowl was located on a small city block bounded by [[Broad Street, Philadelphia|N. Broad St.]], W. Huntingdon St., N. 15th St. and W. Lehigh Avenue.\n\nThe ballpark was initially built in 1887. It was constructed by Phillies owners AJ Reach and John Rogers.<ref name=\"Jordan\">{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=David|title=Closing 'Em Down: Final Games at Thirteen Classic Ballparks|year=2010|publisher=McFarland Publishing Company|location=USA|isbn=9780786449682|page=216}}</ref> The ballpark cost $80,000 and had a capacity of 12,500.<ref name=\"Jordan\" /> At that time the media praised it as state-of-the-art. In the [[dead-ball era]], the outfield was enclosed by a relatively low wall all around. Center field was fairly close, with the railroad tracks running behind it. Later, the tracks were lowered and the field was extended over top of them. Bleachers were built in left field, and over time various extensions were added to the originally low right field wall, resulting in the famous {{convert|60|ft|m|sing=on}} fence.\n\nThe ballpark's second incarnation opened in 1895. It was notable for having the first cantilevered upper deck in a sports stadium, and was the first ballpark to use steel and brick for the majority of its construction. It also took the rule book literally, as the sweeping curve behind the plate was about {{convert|60|ft|m}}, and instead of angling back toward the foul lines, the {{convert|60|ft|m|sing=on}} wide foul ground extended all the way to the wall in right, and well down the left field line also. The spacious foul ground, while not fan-friendly, would have resulted in more foul-fly outs than in most parks, and thus was probably the park's one saving grace in the minds of otherwise-frustrated pitchers.\n\n==The Baker Wall==\n[[File:Baker bowl right field.png|thumb|left|260px|Baker Bowl's right field wall in 1937 after the metal screen was added to extend the total height to {{convert|60|ft|m}}. Notice the Phillies advertisement for [[Lifebuoy (soap)|Lifebuoy Soap]] along the length of the wall. An often-told joke was that even if the team used the product, they still \"stunk\".]]\nThe most notable and talked-about feature of Baker Bowl was the right field wall; its closest distance was only 280 feet (85 m) from home plate, with right-center only 300 feet (91.5 m) away, and with a screen-and-wall barrier that in its final form was 60 feet (18 m) high. By comparison, the [[Green Monster]] at [[Fenway Park]] is 37 feet (11 m) high, and 310 feet (94 m) away. The Baker wall was a rather difficult task to surmount. The wall was an amalgam of different materials. It was originally a relatively normal-height masonry structure. When it became clear that it was too soft a home run touch, the barrier was extended upward using more masonry, wood, and a metal pipe-and-wire screen. The masonry in the lower part of the wall was extremely rough (writer [[Michael Benson (author)|Michael Benson]] termed it \"the sort of surface that efficiently removes an outfielder's skin upon contact\"<ref>Benson, Michael. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YHITAQAAIAAJ&dq=Michael+Benson+baseball&q=%22sort+of+surface%22#search_anchor Ballparks of North America]''. McFarland, 1989, p298.</ref>) and eventually a layer of tin was laid over the entire structure except for the upper part of the screen. The wall dominated the stadium in much the same way as the Green Monster does, only some {{convert|30|ft|m}} closer to the diamond; and because of its material, it made a distinctive sound when balls ricocheted off it, as happened frequently. The clubhouse was located above and behind the center field wall.<ref name=\"Jordan\" /> No batter ever hit a ball over the clubhouse, but [[Rogers Hornsby]] once hit a ball through a window.<ref name=\"Jordan\" />\n\n==Name==\nThe ballpark, shoehorned as it was into the Philadelphia city grid, acquired a number of nicknames over the years. Baker Bowl is the best-known name, and is nearly always referred to by that name in histories of the Phillies.\n\nThe prosaic \"Philadelphia Baseball Grounds\" or \"Philadelphia Baseball Park\" was the name often used by sportswriters prior to the Baker era. The opening day game program in 1887 called it \"Philadelphia Ball Park\". Photographs during its later years show the sign on the ballpark's exterior with the equally prosaic label \"National League Park\". \"Huntingdon Street Grounds\" was a nickname for a while, after the street running behind the first base line and intersecting Broad Street.\n\nBaker Bowl, also called \"Baker Field\" in the baseball guides, referred to one-time Phillies owner [[William Baker (baseball)|William F. Baker]]. The use of \"Baker Field\" was perhaps confusing, since [[Columbia University]]'s athletic facility in New York City was also called [[Baker Field]]. How it acquired the unique suffix \"Bowl\" is subject to conjecture. It may have referred to the banked bicycle track that was there for a time, or it may have been used derisively, suggesting non-existent luxuriousness. \"The Hump\" referred to a hill in center field covering a partially submerged railroad tunnel in the street beyond right field that extended through into center field. Outfielders would occasionally feel the rumblings of the trains passing underneath them.<ref name=\"Jordan\" />\n\n\"The Cigar Box\" and \"The Band Box\" referred to the tiny size of the playing field. After the demise of the Baker Bowl, the terms \"cigar box\" and \"bandbox\" were subsequently applied to any \"intimate\" ballpark (like Boston's [[Fenway Park]] or Brooklyn's [[Ebbets Field]]) whose configurations were conducive to players hitting [[home run]]s.\n\nThe first time the term \"Baker Bowl\" appeared in the Philadelphia ''Inquirer'' was in July 1923, and the paper continued to be use that name frequently until the ballpark's demise. The Phillies, for their part, continued to use the formal name \"National League Park\" in newspaper advertisements of ticket sales, a practice they continued all the way to the final game day, June 30, 1938.\n\n==Philadelphia Phillies==\nDuring the 51\u00bd seasons the Phillies played there, they managed only one pennant ([[1915 Philadelphia Phillies season|1915]]). The [[1915 World Series]] was significant in that it was the first time a sitting president attended a World Series game when [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] attended and threw out the first pitch prior to Game 2.<ref>{{cite book |title=Legends of the Philadelphia Phillies|last=Gordon|first=Robert|year=2005|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=1-56639-454-6|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VeyuZSvEcFgC&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=%22National+League+Park%22+Phillies|accessdate=June 3, 2009}}</ref> The Series was also the first post-season appearance by [[Babe Ruth]], and the last to be played in a venue whose structure predated the modern World Series.\n\n[[File:Baker Bowl 1915.jpg|thumb|270px|Crowd entering the Baker Bowl, 1915]]\nWhile they were occasionally at least respectable in the dead-ball era, once the lively ball was introduced the Phillies nearly always finished in last place, substantially helping them towards the 10,000-loss \"milestone\" they reached on July 15, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mel|last=Antonen|title=Phillies Are No. 1 in Loss Column|date=July 16, 2007|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/phillies/2007-07-02-Loser-Phillies_N.htm|accessdate=April 1, 2009}}</ref> During its last two decades, the ballpark became heaven for batters (both home and visiting), whereas having to play half their games there every year became hell for the Phillies' pitching staff. For a number of years, a huge advertising sign on the right field wall read \"The Phillies Use [[Lifebuoy (soap)|Lifebuoy]]\", a popular brand of soap. This led to the oft-reported quip that appended \"... and they still stink!\" In 1936, a vandal sneaked into Baker Bowl one night and actually wrote that phrase on the Lifebuoy ad.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/phillies/20100228_Hope_is_eternal__even_for_Phillies_fans.html|title=Hope is eternal, even for Phillies fans|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=February 28, 2010|first=Gerard|last=Shields|accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref> Conventional wisdom ties their failures to Baker Bowl, but they remained cellar-dwellers in [[Shibe Park]] as well.\n\n[[File:Umpires at 1915 World Series.jpg|thumb|270px|left|The umpires lined up before a game of the [[1915 World Series]] at the Baker Bowl.]]\nOn June 9, 1914, [[Honus Wagner]] hit his 3,000th career hit in the stadium. Babe Ruth played his last major league baseball game in Baker Bowl on May 30, 1935.\n\nThe ballpark was abandoned during the middle of the [[1938 Philadelphia Phillies season|1938 season]], as the Phillies chose to move 5 blocks west on Lehigh Avenue to rent the newer and more spacious [[Shibe Park]] from the [[Philadelphia A's|A's]] rather than remain at the Baker Bowl.

In their three seasons there, they had a 9\u201321\u20131 record.\n\nEagles' owner [[Bert Bell]] hoped to play home games at larger [[Shibe Park]], but negotiations with the Athletics were not fruitful, and Bell agreed to a deal with Phillies' owner Gerry Nugent. For Eagles games, 5,000 temporary seats were erected along the right-field wall. The Eagles played their first game at the ballpark on October 3, 1933, a 40\u20130 pre-season victory over a U.S. Marines team; the game was played at night under rented floodlights. In the first regular-season game on October 18, 1933, 1,750 fans saw the [[Portsmouth Spartans]] beat the Eagles, 25\u20130. Later that season, 17,850 fans watched the Eagles tie the [[Chicago Bears]] on Sunday, November 18, 1933. Under [[Pennsylvania blue laws]], Sunday games had been prohibited.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Eagles Encyclopedia|last1=Didinger|first1=Ray|first2=Robert S.|last2=Lyons|year=2005|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=1-59213-449-1|page=199|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yV7lvstPuqgC&pg=PA199&dq=phillies+a%27s+preseason|accessdate=May 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\nWith the ballpark in poor condition, the Eagles left Baker Bowl after the 1935 season for the city-owned [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|Municipal Stadium]], which was then only 10 years old and could seat up to 100,000 spectators.\n\n==Other tenants==\nDuring its tenure, the park also hosted [[Negro League]] games, including those of the [[Hilldale Daisies]] and [[Negro League World Series]] games from 1924\u201326. The first two games of the [[1924 Colored World Series]] between the [[Kansas City Monarchs]] and the local [[Hilldale Club]] were hosted at Baker Bowl on October 3 and 4, owing to its larger capacity.\n\nIt was during a 1929 exhibition with a Negro League team that [[Babe Ruth]] hit two home runs that landed about halfway into the rail yards across the street in right.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Year Babe Ruth Hit 104 Home Runs: Recrowning Baseball's Greatest Slugger|last=Jenkinson|first=Bill|year=2007|publisher=Carroll & Graf|isbn=978-0-7867-1906-8}}</ref>\n\n[[Rodeo]]s were occasionally held at Baker Bowl in order to raise additional revenue. That activity and mindset fit with the reported use of sheep to graze on the field during Phillies road trips, in lieu of buying lawn mowers, until sometime in the 1920s.\n\nIn 1923, Phillies Park hosted multiple [[college football]] games of [[Saint Joseph's Hawks football]].<ref>{{cite web|title=SATURDAYS COLLEGE|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/135874577/|website=newspapers.com|publisher=Wilkes-Barre Times Leader|accessdate=13 February 2018|location=Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|page=10|language=English|date=13 October 1923}}</ref>\n\n==Disasters==\n[[File:Shibe Park and Baker Bowl aerial, September 1929.jpg|thumb|left|Shibe Park (foreground), and Baker Bowl (background upper right corner)]]\n\nFire destroyed the grandstand and bleachers of the original stadium on August 6, 1894. The $80,000 in damage (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|80000|1894}}}} today) was covered fully by insurance. The fire also spread to the adjoining properties, causing an additional $20,000 in damage, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20000|1894}}}} today.<ref>{{cite news |title=Another Baseball Park Fire|work=The Christian Recorder|date=August 9, 1894}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Phillies were playing a short road trip and then staging six home games at the University of Pennsylvania Grounds at 39th and Spruce, a building crew worked around the clock to erect temporary bleachers. The makeshift stands were finished in time for a game on August 18.\n\nDuring the 1894\u201395 off-season, the park was fully rebuilt of mostly fireproof materials and an innovative cantilevered upper deck. It also contained a banked bicycle track for a while, exploiting the cycling craze of the late 19th century. In terms of pure design, the ballpark was well ahead of its time, but subsequent problems and the parsimony of the team's owners undermined any apparent positives, as the ballpark soon became rundown and unsafe.\n\nDuring a [[Black Saturday (1903)|game on August 8, 1903]], an altercation between two drunken men and two teenage girls in 15th Street caught the attention of bleacher fans down the left field line.<ref name=\"Jordan\"/> Many of them ran to the top of the wooden seating area, and the added stress on that section of the bleachers caused it to collapse into the street, killing 12 and injuring 232. This led to more renovation of the stadium and forced the ownership to sell the team. The Phillies temporarily moved to the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]' home field, [[Columbia Park]], while Baker Bowl was repaired.<ref>{{cite book|title=Connie Mack and the Early Years of Baseball|last1=Macht|first1=Norman L.|first2=Connie|last2=Mack, III|year=2007|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-3263-1|page=316|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZvAWd-Aq5UMC&pg=PA315&dq=Phillies+Athletics+city+series|accessdate=May 22, 2009}}</ref> The Phillies played sixteen games at Columbia Park in August and September 1903.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternate Site Games Since 1901|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/neutral.htm|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=May 22, 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring a game on May 14, 1927, parts of two sections of the lower deck extension along the right-field line collapsed due to rotted shoring timbers, again triggered by an oversize gathering of people, who were seeking shelter from the rain. While no one died during the collapse, one individual died of heart failure in the subsequent stampede that injured 50.\n\nAfter both of those catastrophes, the Phils rented from the A's while repairs were being made to the old structure.\n\n==Legacy==\n\n[[File:SEPTA Main-Line-Signal-29x.jpg|thumb|250px|Looking north from current train depot.<br>Note former Ford Building in background.]]\nOf all the MLB parks built in the 19th century, the Baker Bowl hung on the longest along with League Park in Cleveland, finally hosting its last game on June 30, 1938 or 51 years.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI193806300.shtml Boxscore]</ref> ([[Robison Field]] in St. Louis, the next-longest-lasting 19th-century big-league ballpark, closed in 1920.) \n\nWhen Baker Bowl was first opened, it was praised as the finest baseball palace in America. By the time it was abandoned, it had been a joke for years. ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' ran a series of articles on baseball parks during the summer of 1937, and the article about Baker Bowl was merciless in its ridicule of this park.<ref>[http://www.baseball-fever.com/showthread.php?78222-Baker-Bowl-photos Baker Bowl / Philadelphia Park (aka Philadelphia Grounds)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \n\nAfter the Phillies moved to Shibe Park, the upper deck was peeled off and the stadium was used for sports ranging from midget auto racing to ice skating. Its old centerfield clubhouse served as a piano bar for a while. In February 1946, owners of the NHL's dormant [[Montreal Maroons]] franchise announced plans to build a 20,000-seat arena at the site, at a cost of $2.5 million. However, the group was unable to get funding for the project, so it came to naught (Philadelphia would not get [[Philadelphia Flyers|another NHL team]] until 1967). By the late 1940s, all that stood of the original structure were the four outer walls and a field choked with weeds. What remained of the ballpark was finally demolished in 1950 \u2013 coincidentally, the year of the Phils' first pennant since 1915. The site now features a gas station/convenience store where the center-field clubhouse once stood, garages, and a car wash.\n\nThe many futile attempts to keep it going, for a dozen years after its abandonment, only added to the ridicule due to the park's \"lingering death\". The next two Phillies' ballparks, [[Shibe Park]] and [[Veterans Stadium]], would similarly undergo the cycle of praise upon opening and disdain upon closure.\n\nA Pennsylvania Historical marker stands on [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]] just north of West Huntingdon Street, Philadelphia. The marker is titled, \"Baker Bowl National League Park\" and the text reads,\n\n<blockquote>The Phillies' baseball park from its opening in 1887 until 1938.

One is the roughly 10-story-tall, triangular building across Lehigh to the north-northeast, behind what was centerfield. It was originally a [[Ford Motor Company]] building, and was completed at some point prior to the 1915 World Series. Another is the neoclassical North Broad Street Station train depot building across Broad Street from what was the end of the first base grandstand.

Its formal name, painted on its outer wall, was '''National League Park'''. It was also initially known as '''Philadelphia Park''' or '''Philadelphia Base Ball Grounds / Park'''.\n\nBaker Bowl was located on a small city block bounded by [[Broad Street, Philadelphia|N. Broad St.]], W. Huntingdon St., N. 15th St. and W. Lehigh Avenue.\n\nThe ballpark was initially built in 1887. It was constructed by Phillies owners AJ Reach and John Rogers.<ref name=\"Jordan\">{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=David|title=Closing 'Em Down: Final Games at Thirteen Classic Ballparks|year=2010|publisher=McFarland Publishing Company|location=USA|isbn=9780786449682|page=216}}</ref> The ballpark cost $80,000 and had a capacity of 12,500.<ref name=\"Jordan\" /> At that time the media praised it as state-of-the-art. In the [[dead-ball era]], the outfield was enclosed by a relatively low wall all around. Center field was fairly close, with the railroad tracks running behind it. Later, the tracks were lowered and the field was extended over top of them. Bleachers were built in left field, and over time various extensions were added to the originally low right field wall, resulting in the famous {{convert|60|ft|m|sing=on}} fence.\n\nThe ballpark's second incarnation opened in 1895. It was notable for having the first cantilevered upper deck in a sports stadium, and was the first ballpark to use steel and brick for the majority of its construction. It also took the rule book literally, as the sweeping curve behind the plate was about {{convert|60|ft|m}}, and instead of angling back toward the foul lines, the {{convert|60|ft|m|sing=on}} wide foul ground extended all the way to the wall in right, and well down the left field line also. The spacious foul ground, while not fan-friendly, would have resulted in more foul-fly outs than in most parks, and thus was probably the park's one saving grace in the minds of otherwise-frustrated pitchers.\n\n==The Baker Wall==\n[[File:Baker bowl right field.png|thumb|left|260px|Baker Bowl's right field wall in 1937 after the metal screen was added to extend the total height to {{convert|60|ft|m}}. Notice the Phillies advertisement for [[Lifebuoy (soap)|Lifebuoy Soap]] along the length of the wall. An often-told joke was that even if the team used the product, they still \"stunk\".]]\nThe most notable and talked-about feature of Baker Bowl was the right field wall; its closest distance was only 280 feet (85 m) from home plate, with right-center only 300 feet (91.5 m) away, and with a screen-and-wall barrier that in its final form was 60 feet (18 m) high. By comparison, the [[Green Monster]] at [[Fenway Park]] is 37 feet (11 m) high, and 310 feet (94 m) away. The Baker wall was a rather difficult task to surmount. The wall was an amalgam of different materials. It was originally a relatively normal-height masonry structure. When it became clear that it was too soft a home run touch, the barrier was extended upward using more masonry, wood, and a metal pipe-and-wire screen. The masonry in the lower part of the wall was extremely rough (writer [[Michael Benson (author)|Michael Benson]] termed it \"the sort of surface that efficiently removes an outfielder's skin upon contact\"<ref>Benson, Michael. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YHITAQAAIAAJ&dq=Michael+Benson+baseball&q=%22sort+of+surface%22#search_anchor Ballparks of North America]''. McFarland, 1989, p298.</ref>) and eventually a layer of tin was laid over the entire structure except for the upper part of the screen. The wall dominated the stadium in much the same way as the Green Monster does, only some {{convert|30|ft|m}} closer to the diamond; and because of its material, it made a distinctive sound when balls ricocheted off it, as happened frequently. The clubhouse was located above and behind the center field wall.<ref name=\"Jordan\" /> No batter ever hit a ball over the clubhouse, but [[Rogers Hornsby]] once hit a ball through a window.<ref name=\"Jordan\" />\n\n==Name==\nThe ballpark, shoehorned as it was into the Philadelphia city grid, acquired a number of nicknames over the years. Baker Bowl is the best-known name, and is nearly always referred to by that name in histories of the Phillies.\n\nThe prosaic \"Philadelphia Baseball Grounds\" or \"Philadelphia Baseball Park\" was the name often used by sportswriters prior to the Baker era. The opening day game program in 1887 called it \"Philadelphia Ball Park\". Photographs during its later years show the sign on the ballpark's exterior with the equally prosaic label \"National League Park\". \"Huntingdon Street Grounds\" was a nickname for a while, after the street running behind the first base line and intersecting Broad Street.\n\nBaker Bowl, also called \"Baker Field\" in the baseball guides, referred to one-time Phillies owner [[William Baker (baseball)|William F. Baker]]. The use of \"Baker Field\" was perhaps confusing, since [[Columbia University]]'s athletic facility in New York City was also called [[Baker Field]]. How it acquired the unique suffix \"Bowl\" is subject to conjecture. It may have referred to the banked bicycle track that was there for a time, or it may have been used derisively, suggesting non-existent luxuriousness. \"The Hump\" referred to a hill in center field covering a partially submerged railroad tunnel in the street beyond right field that extended through into center field. Outfielders would occasionally feel the rumblings of the trains passing underneath them.<ref name=\"Jordan\" />\n\n\"The Cigar Box\" and \"The Band Box\" referred to the tiny size of the playing field. After the demise of the Baker Bowl, the terms \"cigar box\" and \"bandbox\" were subsequently applied to any \"intimate\" ballpark (like Boston's [[Fenway Park]] or Brooklyn's [[Ebbets Field]]) whose configurations were conducive to players hitting [[home run]]s.\n\nThe first time the term \"Baker Bowl\" appeared in the Philadelphia ''Inquirer'' was in July 1923, and the paper continued to be use that name frequently until the ballpark's demise. The Phillies, for their part, continued to use the formal name \"National League Park\" in newspaper advertisements of ticket sales, a practice they continued all the way to the final game day, June 30, 1938.\n\n==Philadelphia Phillies==\nDuring the 51\u00bd seasons the Phillies played there, they managed only one pennant ([[1915 Philadelphia Phillies season|1915]]). The [[1915 World Series]] was significant in that it was the first time a sitting president attended a World Series game when [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] attended and threw out the first pitch prior to Game 2.<ref>{{cite book |title=Legends of the Philadelphia Phillies|last=Gordon|first=Robert|year=2005|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=1-56639-454-6|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VeyuZSvEcFgC&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=%22National+League+Park%22+Phillies|accessdate=June 3, 2009}}</ref> The Series was also the first post-season appearance by [[Babe Ruth]], and the last to be played in a venue whose structure predated the modern World Series.\n\n[[File:Baker Bowl 1915.jpg|thumb|270px|Crowd entering the Baker Bowl, 1915]]\nWhile they were occasionally at least respectable in the dead-ball era, once the lively ball was introduced the Phillies nearly always finished in last place, substantially helping them towards the 10,000-loss \"milestone\" they reached on July 15, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mel|last=Antonen|title=Phillies Are No. 1 in Loss Column|date=July 16, 2007|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/phillies/2007-07-02-Loser-Phillies_N.htm|accessdate=April 1, 2009}}</ref> During its last two decades, the ballpark became heaven for batters (both home and visiting), whereas having to play half their games there every year became hell for the Phillies' pitching staff. For a number of years, a huge advertising sign on the right field wall read \"The Phillies Use [[Lifebuoy (soap)|Lifebuoy]]\", a popular brand of soap. This led to the oft-reported quip that appended \"... and they still stink!\" In 1936, a vandal sneaked into Baker Bowl one night and actually wrote that phrase on the Lifebuoy ad.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/phillies/20100228_Hope_is_eternal__even_for_Phillies_fans.html|title=Hope is eternal, even for Phillies fans|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=February 28, 2010|first=Gerard|last=Shields|accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref> Conventional wisdom ties their failures to Baker Bowl, but they remained cellar-dwellers in [[Shibe Park]] as well.\n\n[[File:Umpires at 1915 World Series.jpg|thumb|270px|left|The umpires lined up before a game of the [[1915 World Series]] at the Baker Bowl.]]\nOn June 9, 1914, [[Honus Wagner]] hit his 3,000th career hit in the stadium. Babe Ruth played his last major league baseball game in Baker Bowl on May 30, 1935.\n\nThe ballpark was abandoned during the middle of the [[1938 Philadelphia Phillies season|1938 season]], as the Phillies chose to move 5 blocks west on Lehigh Avenue to rent the newer and more spacious [[Shibe Park]] from the [[Philadelphia A's|A's]] rather than remain at the Baker Bowl.

In their three seasons there, they had a 9\u201321\u20131 record.\n\nEagles' owner [[Bert Bell]] hoped to play home games at larger [[Shibe Park]], but negotiations with the Athletics were not fruitful, and Bell agreed to a deal with Phillies' owner Gerry Nugent. For Eagles games, 5,000 temporary seats were erected along the right-field wall. The Eagles played their first game at the ballpark on October 3, 1933, a 40\u20130 pre-season victory over a U.S. Marines team; the game was played at night under rented floodlights. In the first regular-season game on October 18, 1933, 1,750 fans saw the [[Portsmouth Spartans]] beat the Eagles, 25\u20130. Later that season, 17,850 fans watched the Eagles tie the [[Chicago Bears]] on Sunday, November 18, 1933. Under [[Pennsylvania blue laws]], Sunday games had been prohibited.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Eagles Encyclopedia|last1=Didinger|first1=Ray|first2=Robert S.|last2=Lyons|year=2005|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=1-59213-449-1|page=199|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yV7lvstPuqgC&pg=PA199&dq=phillies+a%27s+preseason|accessdate=May 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\nWith the ballpark in poor condition, the Eagles left Baker Bowl after the 1935 season for the city-owned [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|Municipal Stadium]], which was then only 10 years old and could seat up to 100,000 spectators.\n\n==Other tenants==\nDuring its tenure, the park also hosted [[Negro League]] games, including those of the [[Hilldale Daisies]] and [[Negro League World Series]] games from 1924\u201326. The first two games of the [[1924 Colored World Series]] between the [[Kansas City Monarchs]] and the local [[Hilldale Club]] were hosted at Baker Bowl on October 3 and 4, owing to its larger capacity.\n\nIt was during a 1929 exhibition with a Negro League team that [[Babe Ruth]] hit two home runs that landed about halfway into the rail yards across the street in right.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Year Babe Ruth Hit 104 Home Runs: Recrowning Baseball's Greatest Slugger|last=Jenkinson|first=Bill|year=2007|publisher=Carroll & Graf|isbn=978-0-7867-1906-8}}</ref>\n\n[[Rodeo]]s were occasionally held at Baker Bowl in order to raise additional revenue. That activity and mindset fit with the reported use of sheep to graze on the field during Phillies road trips, in lieu of buying lawn mowers, until sometime in the 1920s.\n\nIn 1923, Phillies Park hosted multiple [[college football]] games of [[Saint Joseph's Hawks football]].<ref>{{cite web|title=SATURDAYS COLLEGE|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/135874577/|website=newspapers.com|publisher=Wilkes-Barre Times Leader|accessdate=13 February 2018|location=Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|page=10|language=English|date=13 October 1923}}</ref>\n\n==Disasters==\n[[File:Shibe Park and Baker Bowl aerial, September 1929.jpg|thumb|left|Shibe Park (foreground), and Baker Bowl (background upper right corner)]]\n\nFire destroyed the grandstand and bleachers of the original stadium on August 6, 1894. The $80,000 in damage (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|80000|1894}}}} today) was covered fully by insurance. The fire also spread to the adjoining properties, causing an additional $20,000 in damage, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20000|1894}}}} today.<ref>{{cite news |title=Another Baseball Park Fire|work=The Christian Recorder|date=August 9, 1894}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Phillies were playing a short road trip and then staging six home games at the University of Pennsylvania Grounds at 39th and Spruce, a building crew worked around the clock to erect temporary bleachers. The makeshift stands were finished in time for a game on August 18.\n\nDuring the 1894\u201395 off-season, the park was fully rebuilt of mostly fireproof materials and an innovative cantilevered upper deck. It also contained a banked bicycle track for a while, exploiting the cycling craze of the late 19th century. In terms of pure design, the ballpark was well ahead of its time, but subsequent problems and the parsimony of the team's owners undermined any apparent positives, as the ballpark soon became rundown and unsafe.\n\nDuring a [[Black Saturday (1903)|game on August 8, 1903]], an altercation between two drunken men and two teenage girls in 15th Street caught the attention of bleacher fans down the left field line.<ref name=\"Jordan\"/> Many of them ran to the top of the wooden seating area, and the added stress on that section of the bleachers caused it to collapse into the street, killing 12 and injuring 232. This led to more renovation of the stadium and forced the ownership to sell the team. The Phillies temporarily moved to the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]' home field, [[Columbia Park]], while Baker Bowl was repaired.<ref>{{cite book|title=Connie Mack and the Early Years of Baseball|last1=Macht|first1=Norman L.|first2=Connie|last2=Mack, III|year=2007|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-3263-1|page=316|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZvAWd-Aq5UMC&pg=PA315&dq=Phillies+Athletics+city+series|accessdate=May 22, 2009}}</ref> The Phillies played sixteen games at Columbia Park in August and September 1903.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternate Site Games Since 1901|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/neutral.htm|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=May 22, 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring a game on May 14, 1927, parts of two sections of the lower deck extension along the right-field line collapsed due to rotted shoring timbers, again triggered by an oversize gathering of people, who were seeking shelter from the rain. While no one died during the collapse, one individual died of heart failure in the subsequent stampede that injured 50.\n\nAfter both of those catastrophes, the Phils rented from the A's while repairs were being made to the old structure.\n\n==Legacy==\n\n[[File:SEPTA Main-Line-Signal-29x.jpg|thumb|250px|Looking north from current train depot.<br>Note former Ford Building in background.]]\nOf all the MLB parks built in the 19th century, the Baker Bowl hung on the longest along with League Park in Cleveland, finally hosting its last game on June 30, 1938 or 51 years.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI193806300.shtml Boxscore]</ref> ([[Robison Field]] in St. Louis, the next-longest-lasting 19th-century big-league ballpark, closed in 1920.) \n\nWhen Baker Bowl was first opened, it was praised as the finest baseball palace in America. By the time it was abandoned, it had been a joke for years. ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' ran a series of articles on baseball parks during the summer of 1937, and the article about Baker Bowl was merciless in its ridicule of this park.<ref>[http://www.baseball-fever.com/showthread.php?78222-Baker-Bowl-photos Baker Bowl / Philadelphia Park (aka Philadelphia Grounds)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \n\nAfter the Phillies moved to Shibe Park, the upper deck was peeled off and the stadium was used for sports ranging from midget auto racing to ice skating. Its old centerfield clubhouse served as a piano bar for a while. In February 1946, owners of the NHL's dormant [[Montreal Maroons]] franchise announced plans to build a 20,000-seat arena at the site, at a cost of $2.5 million. However, the group was unable to get funding for the project, so it came to naught (Philadelphia would not get [[Philadelphia Flyers|another NHL team]] until 1967). By the late 1940s, all that stood of the original structure were the four outer walls and a field choked with weeds. What remained of the ballpark was finally demolished in 1950 \u2013 coincidentally, the year of the Phils' first pennant since 1915. The site now features a gas station/convenience store where the center-field clubhouse once stood, garages, and a car wash.\n\nThe many futile attempts to keep it going, for a dozen years after its abandonment, only added to the ridicule due to the park's \"lingering death\". The next two Phillies' ballparks, [[Shibe Park]] and [[Veterans Stadium]], would similarly undergo the cycle of praise upon opening and disdain upon closure.\n\nA Pennsylvania Historical marker stands on [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]] just north of West Huntingdon Street, Philadelphia. The marker is titled, \"Baker Bowl National League Park\" and the text reads,\n\n<blockquote>The Phillies' baseball park from its opening in 1887 until 1938.

One is the roughly 10-story-tall, triangular building across Lehigh to the north-northeast, behind what was centerfield. It was originally a [[Ford Motor Company]] building, and was completed at some point prior to the 1915 World Series. Another is the neoclassical North Broad Street Station train depot building across Broad Street from what was the end of the first base grandstand.

The film stars [[Peter Weller]], [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]], [[Dan O'Herlihy]], [[Kurtwood Smith]], [[Miguel Ferrer]], and [[Ronny Cox]]. Set in a crime-ridden [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in the near future, ''RoboCop'' centers on police officer Alex Murphy (Weller) who is murdered by a gang of criminals and subsequently revived by the megacorporation [[RoboCop (franchise)#Omni Consumer Products|Omni Consumer Products]] as the superhuman [[cyborg]] law enforcer [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]].\n\nThemes that make up the basis of ''RoboCop'' include [[Influence of mass media|media influence]], [[gentrification]], [[corruption]], [[authoritarianism]], [[greed]], [[privatization]], [[capitalism]], [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[dystopia]] and [[human nature]]. It received positive reviews and was cited as one of the best films of 1987, spawning a [[RoboCop (franchise)|franchise]] that included merchandise, two sequels, [[RoboCop: The Series|a television series]], a [[RoboCop (2014 film)|remake]], two animated TV series, a television [[RoboCop: Prime Directives|mini-series]], [[List of RoboCop video games|video games]], and a number of [[RoboCop (comics)|comic book adaptations/crossovers]]. In 2018 it was announced that a direct sequel to the original film titled ''[[RoboCop Returns]]'' was in the works and it would ignore the other sequels and remake, including the 1994 TV series and the TV mini-series. ''RoboCop'' was produced for a relatively modest $13 million.<ref name=\"box office\" /> Honors for the film include five [[Saturn Award]]s, two [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] nominations and the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing]], along with nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn a [[dystopian]] future, [[Detroit]] is on the verge of collapse due to financial mismanagement and a high [[crime rate]], but where this city remains livable and has not gone bankrupt. The city signs a deal with the mega-corporation [[RoboCop (franchise)#Omni Consumer Products|Omni Consumer Products]] (OCP) to run Detroit's police department in exchange for letting OCP rebuild run-down sections of the city into a high-end [[utopia]]. Senior Vice President Dick Jones demonstrates a new law enforcement robot, [[RoboCop (franchise)#ED-209|ED-209]]. However, the robot malfunctions, killing an executive. Bob Morton, an ambitious executive, uses the opportunity to introduce his own experimental [[cyborg]] design, [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]]. The chairman is dismayed at the ED-209 failure and approves Morton's plan, to Jones's [[wrath]].\n\nOn patrol in the major Metro West precinct, officers Alex Murphy and Anne Lewis pursue a notorious gang after an armed robbery. Investigating their hideout, an abandoned [[steel mill]], Murphy defeats one of the gang\u2018s [[hitmen]], but is ambushed by their [[gang boss]], Clarence Boddicker. Boddicker and his accomplices shoot Murphy repeatedly with shotguns, until Boddicker shoots him through the head. Lewis arrives too late to help. Murphy is evacuated by helicopter but dies in the trauma unit.\n\nOCP claims Murphy's body and converts it into RoboCop. The cyborg is programmed with three Prime Directives: serve the [[public trust]]; protect the innocent; and uphold the law. RoboCop is assigned to Metro West, where he begins a brutally efficient campaign against crime. However, though Murphy's memory was wiped, RoboCop begins to remember scenes from Murphy's life, including his death. Lewis confirms to RoboCop that he is Murphy, to his shock. On patrol, RoboCop foils Emil's armed robbery; Emil recognizes Murphy's mannerisms, furthering RoboCop's memory recall. RoboCop uses the police database to identify the gang members and locate his home, now abandoned. Meanwhile, at the behest of Jones, Boddicker murders Morton.\n\nRoboCop locates Boddicker at a cocaine factory, where he kills almost everyone present and captures Boddicker. RoboCop brutalizes Boddicker, but before RoboCop can kill him, Boddicker reveals that he is in Jones's employ. Depositing Boddicker at Metro West, RoboCop heads to OCP Tower to arrest Jones for aiding Boddicker. However, when RoboCop attempts to arrest Jones, RoboCop unwittingly activates Directive 4, implanted by Jones himself: \"Any attempt to arrest a senior officer of OCP results in shutdown\". Jones admits his culpability in Morton's death, and tries to kill RoboCop with an ED-209 unit. However, RoboCop escapes to the garage, where police ambush him. Lewis finds RoboCop and helps him escape to the abandoned steel mill to repair himself.\n\nThe police, angered by OCP's underfunding and short-staffing, call a strike, and Detroit descends into chaos. Jones, having freed Boddicker and his gang, provides them with heavy weapons and a tracking system for RoboCop, then sends them out to destroy RoboCop. The gang arrives at the steel mill, but they are dispatched by RoboCop and Lewis. The final confrontation with Boddicker ends with RoboCop violently stabbing him in the throat with the computer data spike installed in his fist.\n\nRoboCop returns to OCP Tower, destroying the ED-209 at the door with Boddicker's weapon. He confronts Jones at a board meeting, revealing Directive 4 and his recording of Jones' confession. Jones grabs a gun and takes the OCP chairman, planning to escape via helicopter with him as hostage. The chairman clues in and fires Jones, making Directive 4 irrelevant; allowing RoboCop to shoot him and he falls to his death. Impressed and thankful for saving his life, the chairman asks RoboCop's name; he replies \"Murphy\", indicating he has regained a sense of his humanity.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Weller]] as [[RoboCop (character)|Alex Murphy / RoboCop]]:\n:A police officer in old Detroit who is murdered by the Boddicker gang, and revived by OCP as an experimental cyborg police officer\n* [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] as Anne Lewis:\n:A veteran police officer and Murphy's former partner\n* [[Dan O'Herlihy]] as The Old Man:\n:The chief executive of OCP\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Dick Jones:\n:The Senior President of OCP\n* [[Kurtwood Smith]] as Clarence Boddicker:\n:A career criminal in the employ of Dick Jones, and leader of the Boddicker gang\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as Bob Morton:\n:A young and ambitious OCP executive responsible for the \"Robocop\" project\n\nIn addition to the main cast, ''Robocop'' features [[Paul McCrane]] as Emil Antonowsky, [[Ray Wise]] as Leon Nash, [[Jesse D.

Neumeier was inspired by a poster for the 1982 science fiction film ''[[Blade Runner]];'' he asked his friend what the film was about and his friend replied, \"It's about a cop hunting robots\". While the two were attempting to pitch the [[screenplay]], they were stranded at an airplane terminal with a high-ranking film executive for several hours.

The plot takes place in a fairly distant future, the world is ruled by corporations and it was assumed that this world would be visually similar to the world shown in ''Blade Runner''.

Neumeier and Miner felt that they could successfully combine their ideas.<ref>[https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a27322/robocop-oral-history/ RoboCop: The Oral History by Simon Abrams]</ref> Miner also shot a music video with this character for [[Y&T]] band.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10105950/mediaindex?ref_=tt_pv_mi_sm Y & T: Don't Stop Runnin (1984 Video)]</ref>\n\n''RoboCop'' was the first major Hollywood production for Dutch director [[Paul Verhoeven]]. Although he had been working in the [[Netherlands]] for more than a decade and directed several films to acclaim, such as ''[[Soldier of Orange]]'' in 1977, he moved to Hollywood in 1984 to seek broader opportunities. While ''RoboCop'' is often credited as his English language debut, he had in fact previously made ''[[Flesh & Blood (film)|Flesh & Blood]]'' in 1985. Verhoeven recalled that, when he first glanced through the script, he discarded it in disgust. Afterwards, his wife, after picking the script from the bin and reading it more thoroughly, convinced him that the plot had more substance than he had originally assumed.<ref name=\"Commentary\">{{cite video|people=Verhoeven, Paul; Neumeier, Edward; Davison, Jon|date=2004|title=RoboCop, Special Collector's Edition: Audio commentary |publisher=[[MGM]]|medium=DVD}}</ref> ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'' director [[Alex Cox]] was offered the opportunity to direct before Verhoeven came aboard.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |url=https://www.avclub.com/alex-cox-1798208136 |title=Alex Cox Interview with The Onion |newspaper=[[The A.V.

However, each man's large frame would have made it difficult for either of them to move in the cumbersome RoboCop suit, which had been modeled on [[ice hockey|hockey]] gear and designed to be large and bulky. Weller won the role both because Verhoeven felt that he could adequately convey [[pathos]] with his lower face, and because Weller was especially lithe and could more easily move inside the suit than a bigger actor.<ref>DVD Director's Commentary</ref>\n\n[[Stephanie Zimbalist]], who at the time was one of the stars of the television series ''[[Remington Steele]]'', was originally cast as Anne Lewis. [[NBC]] had canceled ''Remington Steele'' in 1986, leaving the stars free to accept other roles, subject to options for further episodes on their contracts.

Cox was an actor who, until then, was primarily known for \"nice-guy\" roles, such as fatherly figures.  Similarly, Smith had been cast as more intellectual characters.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Verhoeven chose to outfit Smith's character Clarence Boddicker in [[rimless glasses]] because of their intellectual association, creating a disparity in the character that Verhoeven found akin to the similarly bespectacled [[Heinrich Himmler]].<ref>''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1478283/ Villains of Old Detroit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210225822/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1478283/# |date=2017-02-10 }}''.

The score alternates brass-heavy material, including the RoboCop theme and ED-209's theme, with more introverted pieces for strings, such as during RoboCop's homecoming scene. The music was performed by the [[Sinfonia of London]], conducted by [[Howard Blake]] and [[Tony Britten]]. The soundtrack initially was released by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] containing highlights from the score in an order different from that heard in the movie. The final four tracks were included on later CD re-issues.\n\nOn the theatrical trailer, the theme of ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) was used instead of the RoboCop theme. Similarly, the track Van Chase was used for the trailer of \"[[Dollman]]\". The theme song also made its way into the arcade and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] ''RoboCop'' video games.\n\nThe song \"Show Me Your Spine\" by [[PTP (band)|P.T.P.]] was played during the nightclub scene. P.T.P was a short-lived side project consisting of members of the band [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Skinny Puppy]]. However, this song was not available in any official form and could only be heard in the film. It was eventually released in 2004 on a compilation album called ''[[Side Trax]]'' by Ministry.\n\n==Design==\n===RoboCop===\nThe task of creating the RoboCop suit was given to [[Rob Bottin]].<ref name=\"The Atlantic Cities\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/04/robocop-statue-definitely-coming-detroit/1702/|title=RoboCop Statue 'Definitely' Coming to Detroit|last=Metcalfe|first=John|date=April 6, 2012|work=Comic Book Movie|accessdate=April 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408151228/http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/04/robocop-statue-definitely-coming-detroit/1702/#|archive-date=2012-04-08|url-status=live}}</ref> The studio decided that Bottin would be the ideal person to create the RoboCop suit, as he had just finished doing the special effects for John Carpenter's ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]''. A budget of up to one million dollars was allotted to the completion of the suit, making it the most expensive item on the set. A total of six suits were made: three intact and three showing damage.\n\nBottin himself had produced early design sketches for the suit's prototype that the studio accepted enthusiastically, albeit with the request of some minor adjustments. Rob, Paul Verhoeven, and Edward Neumeier came up with the concept of the suit being more of an outer shell, with very little of the actor's actual face being visible. Bottin explained the basis of the design:\n<blockquote>It's meant to look very speedy and aerodynamic. All the lines are measured to go on a slant{{spaced ndash}}forward, forward, forward! All the lines were geometric, and complement every shape on the body from all angles. When Verhoeven came on the project, he requested numerous design changes, additions to the suit which looked more like machine than man-like.

Although we went through fifty different variations, developing his character, everything came back to man-like. It's definitely a guy in the suit, which doesn't belittle it any.<ref name =Cinefantastique/></blockquote>\n\nThe suit itself was attached to the actor in sections. To wear the helmet, Peter Weller wore a [[bald cap]] that allowed the helmet to be removed easily. After almost 10 months of preparation, the RoboCop suit was completed based on life casts from Peter Weller and Bottin's six-foot clay models. The suit's color was supposed to be bright blue; however, it was given a more grayish tint to make it look more metallic and produce less glare on the camera when it was being filmed.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nPeter Weller had in the meantime hired Moni Yakim, the head of the Movement Department at [[Juilliard]], to help create an appropriate way for him to move his body while wearing the RoboCop suit.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} He and Moni had envisioned RoboCop moving like a snake, dancing around its targets very elusively. The suit, however, proved to be too heavy and cumbersome. Instead, at the suggestion of Moni, it was decided that they would slow down RoboCop's movements in order to make them more appealing and plausible. Filming stopped for three days, allowing Peter and Paul Verhoeven to discuss new movements for the suit.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe original gun for RoboCop was a [[Desert Eagle]], but this was deemed too small. A [[Beretta 93R]] was heavily modified by Ray Williams of Freshour Machine, Texas City, Texas, who extended the gun barrel to make it look bigger and more proportional to RoboCop's hand. The gun holster itself was a standalone piece that was not integrated into the suit. Off-screen technicians would operate the device on cue by pulling cables that would force the holster to open up and allow the gun to be placed inside.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe ED-209 [[stop motion]] model was designed by [[Craig Hayes]],<ref name=\"Duncan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cinefex.com/backissues/issue45.html|title=Clash of the Robotitans|last=Duncan|first=Jody|date=February 1991|work=[[Cinefex]]|accessdate=21 December 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000829034036/http://www.cinefex.com/backissues/issue45.html| archivedate=29 August 2000}}</ref> who also built the full size models, and animated by [[Phil Tippett]], a veteran stop-motion animator.<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> As one of the [[setpiece]]s of the movie, the ED-209's look and animated sequences were under the close supervision of director Paul Verhoeven, who sometimes acted out the robot's movements himself.

Verhoeven also added humorous commercials throughout the news broadcasts to lighten the mood and distract from the violent aspects of the movie (most of the commercials satirize various aspects of the American consumer culture, such as the commercial for the 6000 SUX sedan).

Criterion released the uncut \"director's edit\" on LaserDisc in 1996. In 1998, Criterion released it on [[DVD]], while [[Image Entertainment]] released the R-rated cinema version. The R-rated cinema version was slated to be released on [[Blu-ray]] by Sony in 2006. However, Sony pulled the Blu-ray just days before it was to be released. Only a handful of copies were released to the general public, mainly reviewers, making it very rare. It was re-released on Region 1 DVD in 2007 and on Blu-ray in 2010 as part of the Blu-ray ''Robocop'' Trilogy. A remastered Blu-ray edition was released in January 2014 to tie into the [[RoboCop (2014 film)|2014 remake]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RoboCop Blu-ray|date=January 5, 2014|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/RoboCop-Blu-ray/89781/|publisher=Blu-ray.com|access-date=2014-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122081746/http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/RoboCop-Blu-ray/89781/#|archive-date=2014-01-22|url-status=live}}</ref>\nThe original uncut version was included on the [[Criterion Collection]] LaserDisc and DVD of the film, the 2005 trilogy box set, and the 2007 anniversary edition\u2014the latter two were released by MGM and were unrated. The 2014 [[Blu-ray]] 4K master edition also features this unrated cut.\n\nRegarding the omitted scenes, Verhoeven stated on the 2007 anniversary edition DVD that he had wanted the violence to be \"over the top\", in an almost comical fashion (such as the scene involving the executive that is killed by ED-209, and Bob Morton immediately asking \"Somebody wanna call a goddamn paramedic?!\"). Verhoeven felt that the tone of the violence was more upsetting due to the deletions requested by the MPAA. An alternate network TV Version was also released. The stronger language was either deleted or dubbed over. Blood was kept to a minimum. And, instead of Boddicker running over Emil with his sedan, decapitating him in the process, he swerves around, and misses him.\n\nThe following scenes are presented in the uncut version of the movie which originally received an X Rating: \n*During the boardroom meeting, ED-209 continuously shoots Kinney, who falls back on a table. This scene is now extended slightly to show additional shots being fired and Kenny's body reacting to them. There is also a quick shot of ED-209's programmer unsuccessfully trying to shut it down by ripping out its power cord.\n*A brief alternate shot of Bobby being shot in the leg and the impact that follows before he's tossed out of the getaway van.\n*Murphy's death scene is the most altered scene in the movie. When his hand is shot off, Murphy gets up and a stump is seen where his hand used to be. His right arm is shown being shot off completely (in the theatrical version, Murphy is shown with one arm without any explanation). In the final seconds of his murder, the camera spins around Murphy as he writhes in pain, Clarence shoots him in the head, and a hole appears. This shot was achieved using a sophisticated [[animatronic]] puppet of Peter Weller controlled off-screen. An overhead shot also shows the bloody aftermath of what has happened to Murphy as Lewis looks on shocked at his dead body.\n*When Clarence Boddicker is stabbed in the neck, there is an alternate shot of him holding his neck as he turns around and blood spurts from the wound.\n\nOn November 26, 2019, Arrow video put out a special Blu-ray edition with new extras, both cuts of the film, a television version cut, and interviews with Nancy Allen and Julie Selzer. It uses the same 4K remaster MGM put out on their release back in 2014.<ref>{{Citation|title=RoboCop Blu-ray Release Date November 26, 2019|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/RoboCop-Blu-ray/251851/|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref>\n\n===Cinematic analysis===\nIn a 2013 interview, Edward Neumeier reflected on how the film's script is starting to play into reality: \"We are now living in the world that I was proposing in ''RoboCop'' ... how [[Evil corporation|big corporations]] will 'take care of us' and ... how they won't.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/robocop-dystopia-detroit.html#.VBHewmRdX2I |title=Hamptoninstitution.org |access-date=2014-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911215854/http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/robocop-dystopia-detroit.html#.VBHewmRdX2I#.VBHewmRdX2I |archive-date=2014-09-11 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/25/business/robocop-neumeier-detroit-bankruptcy/index.html# |title=CNN |access-date=2014-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912002743/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/25/business/robocop-neumeier-detroit-bankruptcy/index.html# |archive-date=2014-09-12 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.guernicamag.com/features/austerity-economics-is-like-a-kick-in-the-groin/# |title=Guernicamag.com |access-date=2014-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912000443/http://www.guernicamag.com/features/austerity-economics-is-like-a-kick-in-the-groin/# |archive-date=2014-09-12 |url-status=live |date=2014-06-02 }}</ref>\n\nTwo of the primary themes explored by ''RoboCop'' are the media and human nature. On the Criterion Edition DVD commentary track, executive producer Jon Davison and writer Edward Neumeier both relate the film to the decay of American industry from the 1970s through the early 1980s, with the abandoned \"[[Rust Belt]] style\" factories that RoboCop and Clarence Boddicker's gang use as hideouts reflecting this concern. Massive unemployment is prevalent, being reported frequently on the news, as are poverty and the crime that results from economic hardship.\n\nDirector Paul Verhoeven, known for his heavy use of [[Christian symbolism]], states in the documentary ''Flesh and Steel: The Making of RoboCop'' (featured on the ''RoboCop'' DVD) that his intention was to portray RoboCop as a [[Christ]] figure. This is represented in Murphy's horrific death alluding to the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], his return alluding to the [[resurrection of Jesus]], and the showdown with Clarence Boddicker at the steel mill, which finds RoboCop trudging through ankle-deep water, which alludes to [[Jesus walking on water]].\n\n[[Darian Leader]] considers ''RoboCop'' one example of how the cinema has dealt with the concept of masculinity, showing that to be a man requires more than having the body of a man: something symbolic that is not ultimately human must be added. He sees ''RoboCop'' as similar to ''[[The Terminator]]'' and ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' in this respect. Leader wrote of ''RoboCop'': <blockquote>The RoboCop is a family man who is destroyed by thugs, then rebuilt as a robot by science. His son always insists, before the transformation, that his human father perform the gun spinning trick he sees on TV. When the robot can finally do this properly, he is no longer just a male biological body: he is a body plus machinery, a body which includes within it the symbolic circuitry of science. Old heroes had bits of metal ''outside'' them (knights), but modern heroes have bits of metal ''inside'' them. To be a man today thus involves this kind of real incorporation of symbolic properties.<ref name=\"Leader\">{{cite book |last= Leader |first= Darian |title=Why do women write more letters than they post? |publisher=Faber & Faber |location=London |year=1996 |pages=28 |isbn=978-0-571-17619-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPhilosopher and cultural critic [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] wrote that:\n<blockquote>''RoboCop'', a futuristic story about a policeman shot to death and then revived after all parts of his body have been replaced by artificial substitutes, introduces a more tragic note: the hero who finds himself literally \"between two deaths\"{{spaced ndash}}clinically dead and at the same time provided with a new, mechanical body\u2014starts to remember fragments of his previous, \"human\" life and thus undergoes a process of resubjectivication, changing gradually back from pure incarnated drive to a being of desire. ... [I]f there is a phenomenon that fully deserves to be called the \"fundamental fantasy of contemporary mass culture,\" it is this fantasy of the return of the living dead: the fantasy of a person who does not want to stay dead but returns again and again to pose a threat to the living.<ref name =\"Slavoj \u017di\u017eek\">{{cite book|author=\u017di\u017eek, Slavoj |title=Looking Awry: an Introduction to Jacques Lacan through Popular Culture|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|year=1992|pages=22|isbn=978-0-262-74015-9}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe depiction of Murphy's struggles in reasserting his humanity also deals with themes of identity. This is even touched upon in the cyborg's construction. On the ''Robocop: 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD'', Paul Sammon states:\n<blockquote>Rob Bottin and  Paul Verhoeven, and Ed Neumeier had all come up with a concept that there would be such a potential for psychological disruption. Even if you had supposedly wiped someone's memories and emotions they'd still might have some kind of residual humanity where, if they'd looked at themselves as a complete robot with no relation to their past organic form, they'd completely freak out and have a psychotic breakdown. So the idea was that surgeons had literally skinned off Alex Murphy's face and then placed it on the cyborg. So it's not like they transplanted his head, they just took his face off and laid it on the cyborg, and that was to give him his own little sense of identity.<ref name=\"FandS\">''RoboCop 20th Anniversary Edition DVD''</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Lasting reception===\nIn 2007, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named the film the 14th greatest action film of all time,<ref>{{cite web|title=The 25 Greatest Action Movies Ever!|url=https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,20041669_20041686_20042607_12,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=April 17, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221132614/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20041669_20041686_20042607_12,00.html#|archive-date=2009-02-21|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] rated it as the 19th best action film of all time in 2016.<ref name=complex/>  In 2008, it was selected by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine as one of ''The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time'', placing at #404.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time |url=https://empireonline.com/500/18.asp |magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016234611/http://www.empireonline.com/500/18.asp# |archive-date=2012-10-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''The New York Times'' also included the film in their list of ''The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made''.<ref>{{cite news | title = The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made | url = https://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/1000best.html | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = April 29, 2003 | accessdate = May 22, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131211043539/http://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/1000best.html# | archive-date = 2013-12-11 | url-status = live }}</ref>  [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC Filmsite.org]] and [[Film.com]] rated it as one of the best films of 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/1987.html |title=Greatest Films of 1987 |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC Filmsite.org]] |accessdate=April 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111024733/http://www.filmsite.org/1987.html# |archive-date=2010-01-11 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2756553/the-10-best-movies-of-1987-rave-rentals-from-the-year-of-the-robocop/ |title=The 10 Best Movies of 1987 |publisher=[[RealNetworks|Film.com]] |date=August 2, 2007 |accessdate=April 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016164903/http://www.mtv.com/news/2756553/the-10-best-movies-of-1987-rave-rentals-from-the-year-of-the-robocop/# |archive-date=2018-10-16 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe film was on the ballot for two of the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI 100 Years ... series|100 Series]]'' lists.

The film stars [[Peter Weller]], [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]], [[Dan O'Herlihy]], [[Kurtwood Smith]], [[Miguel Ferrer]], and [[Ronny Cox]]. Set in a crime-ridden [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in the near future, ''RoboCop'' centers on police officer Alex Murphy (Weller) who is murdered by a gang of criminals and subsequently revived by the megacorporation [[RoboCop (franchise)#Omni Consumer Products|Omni Consumer Products]] as the superhuman [[cyborg]] law enforcer [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]].\n\nThemes that make up the basis of ''RoboCop'' include [[Influence of mass media|media influence]], [[gentrification]], [[corruption]], [[authoritarianism]], [[greed]], [[privatization]], [[capitalism]], [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[dystopia]] and [[human nature]].

In 2018 it was announced that a direct sequel to the original film titled ''[[RoboCop Returns]]'' was in the works and it would ignore the other sequels and remake, including the 1994 TV series and the TV mini-series. ''RoboCop'' was produced for a relatively modest $13 million.<ref name=\"box office\" /> Honors for the film include five [[Saturn Award]]s, two [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] nominations and the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing]], along with nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn a [[dystopian]] future, [[Detroit]] is on the verge of collapse due to financial mismanagement and a high [[crime rate]], but where this city remains livable and has not gone bankrupt. The city signs a deal with the mega-corporation [[RoboCop (franchise)#Omni Consumer Products|Omni Consumer Products]] (OCP) to run Detroit's police department in exchange for letting OCP rebuild run-down sections of the city into a high-end [[utopia]]. Senior Vice President Dick Jones demonstrates a new law enforcement robot, [[RoboCop (franchise)#ED-209|ED-209]]. However, the robot malfunctions, killing an executive. Bob Morton, an ambitious executive, uses the opportunity to introduce his own experimental [[cyborg]] design, [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]]. The chairman is dismayed at the ED-209 failure and approves Morton's plan, to Jones's [[wrath]].\n\nOn patrol in the major Metro West precinct, officers Alex Murphy and Anne Lewis pursue a notorious gang after an armed robbery. Investigating their hideout, an abandoned [[steel mill]], Murphy defeats one of the gang\u2018s [[hitmen]], but is ambushed by their [[gang boss]], Clarence Boddicker. Boddicker and his accomplices shoot Murphy repeatedly with shotguns, until Boddicker shoots him through the head. Lewis arrives too late to help. Murphy is evacuated by helicopter but dies in the trauma unit.\n\nOCP claims Murphy's body and converts it into RoboCop. The cyborg is programmed with three Prime Directives: serve the [[public trust]]; protect the innocent; and uphold the law. RoboCop is assigned to Metro West, where he begins a brutally efficient campaign against crime. However, though Murphy's memory was wiped, RoboCop begins to remember scenes from Murphy's life, including his death. Lewis confirms to RoboCop that he is Murphy, to his shock. On patrol, RoboCop foils Emil's armed robbery; Emil recognizes Murphy's mannerisms, furthering RoboCop's memory recall. RoboCop uses the police database to identify the gang members and locate his home, now abandoned. Meanwhile, at the behest of Jones, Boddicker murders Morton.\n\nRoboCop locates Boddicker at a cocaine factory, where he kills almost everyone present and captures Boddicker. RoboCop brutalizes Boddicker, but before RoboCop can kill him, Boddicker reveals that he is in Jones's employ. Depositing Boddicker at Metro West, RoboCop heads to OCP Tower to arrest Jones for aiding Boddicker. However, when RoboCop attempts to arrest Jones, RoboCop unwittingly activates Directive 4, implanted by Jones himself: \"Any attempt to arrest a senior officer of OCP results in shutdown\". Jones admits his culpability in Morton's death, and tries to kill RoboCop with an ED-209 unit. However, RoboCop escapes to the garage, where police ambush him. Lewis finds RoboCop and helps him escape to the abandoned steel mill to repair himself.\n\nThe police, angered by OCP's underfunding and short-staffing, call a strike, and Detroit descends into chaos. Jones, having freed Boddicker and his gang, provides them with heavy weapons and a tracking system for RoboCop, then sends them out to destroy RoboCop. The gang arrives at the steel mill, but they are dispatched by RoboCop and Lewis. The final confrontation with Boddicker ends with RoboCop violently stabbing him in the throat with the computer data spike installed in his fist.\n\nRoboCop returns to OCP Tower, destroying the ED-209 at the door with Boddicker's weapon. He confronts Jones at a board meeting, revealing Directive 4 and his recording of Jones' confession. Jones grabs a gun and takes the OCP chairman, planning to escape via helicopter with him as hostage. The chairman clues in and fires Jones, making Directive 4 irrelevant; allowing RoboCop to shoot him and he falls to his death. Impressed and thankful for saving his life, the chairman asks RoboCop's name; he replies \"Murphy\", indicating he has regained a sense of his humanity.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Weller]] as [[RoboCop (character)|Alex Murphy / RoboCop]]:\n:A police officer in old Detroit who is murdered by the Boddicker gang, and revived by OCP as an experimental cyborg police officer\n* [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] as Anne Lewis:\n:A veteran police officer and Murphy's former partner\n* [[Dan O'Herlihy]] as The Old Man:\n:The chief executive of OCP\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Dick Jones:\n:The Senior President of OCP\n* [[Kurtwood Smith]] as Clarence Boddicker:\n:A career criminal in the employ of Dick Jones, and leader of the Boddicker gang\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as Bob Morton:\n:A young and ambitious OCP executive responsible for the \"Robocop\" project\n\nIn addition to the main cast, ''Robocop'' features [[Paul McCrane]] as Emil Antonowsky, [[Ray Wise]] as Leon Nash, [[Jesse D.

Neumeier was inspired by a poster for the 1982 science fiction film ''[[Blade Runner]];'' he asked his friend what the film was about and his friend replied, \"It's about a cop hunting robots\". While the two were attempting to pitch the [[screenplay]], they were stranded at an airplane terminal with a high-ranking film executive for several hours. Here, they were able to speak to him about the project, and thus began the series of events which eventually gave rise to ''RoboCop''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 1981,{{Contradict-inline|reason=but the previous para says he got the idea from Blade Runner, a 1982 film|date=October 2019}}  Neumeier wrote the first treatment, about a robot police officer who was not a cyborg but in the development of the story his computer mind became more similar to human. The plot takes place in a fairly distant future, the world is ruled by corporations and it was assumed that this world would be visually similar to the world shown in ''Blade Runner''. The treatment was rejected by many studios because of the incompleteness of the storyline and settings.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-127/page/n21 RoboWriters by Lee Goldberg]</ref> In 1984 Neumeier met music video director Michael Miner, who worked on a similar idea; his rough draft of the script was called ''SuperCop'', which was about a police officer who has been seriously injured and becomes a donor for an experiment to create a cybernetic police officer. Neumeier and Miner felt that they could successfully combine their ideas.<ref>[https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a27322/robocop-oral-history/ RoboCop: The Oral History by Simon Abrams]</ref> Miner also shot a music video with this character for [[Y&T]] band.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10105950/mediaindex?ref_=tt_pv_mi_sm Y & T: Don't Stop Runnin (1984 Video)]</ref>\n\n''RoboCop'' was the first major Hollywood production for Dutch director [[Paul Verhoeven]]. Although he had been working in the [[Netherlands]] for more than a decade and directed several films to acclaim, such as ''[[Soldier of Orange]]'' in 1977, he moved to Hollywood in 1984 to seek broader opportunities. While ''RoboCop'' is often credited as his English language debut, he had in fact previously made ''[[Flesh & Blood (film)|Flesh & Blood]]'' in 1985. Verhoeven recalled that, when he first glanced through the script, he discarded it in disgust. Afterwards, his wife, after picking the script from the bin and reading it more thoroughly, convinced him that the plot had more substance than he had originally assumed.<ref name=\"Commentary\">{{cite video|people=Verhoeven, Paul; Neumeier, Edward; Davison, Jon|date=2004|title=RoboCop, Special Collector's Edition: Audio commentary |publisher=[[MGM]]|medium=DVD}}</ref> ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'' director [[Alex Cox]] was offered the opportunity to direct before Verhoeven came aboard.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |url=https://www.avclub.com/alex-cox-1798208136 |title=Alex Cox Interview with The Onion |newspaper=[[The A.V.

On the 20th Anniversary DVD, producer [[Jon Davison (film producer)|Jon Davison]] referred to the film's message as \"fascism for liberals\"{{spaced ndash}}a politically liberal film done in the most violent way possible.\n\n===Casting===\nBefore Peter Weller was cast, [[Rutger Hauer]] and [[Michael Ironside]] were favored to play RoboCop by Verhoeven and the producers, respectively. However, each man's large frame would have made it difficult for either of them to move in the cumbersome RoboCop suit, which had been modeled on [[ice hockey|hockey]] gear and designed to be large and bulky. Weller won the role both because Verhoeven felt that he could adequately convey [[pathos]] with his lower face, and because Weller was especially lithe and could more easily move inside the suit than a bigger actor.<ref>DVD Director's Commentary</ref>\n\n[[Stephanie Zimbalist]], who at the time was one of the stars of the television series ''[[Remington Steele]]'', was originally cast as Anne Lewis. [[NBC]] had canceled ''Remington Steele'' in 1986, leaving the stars free to accept other roles, subject to options for further episodes on their contracts.

Cox was an actor who, until then, was primarily known for \"nice-guy\" roles, such as fatherly figures.  Similarly, Smith had been cast as more intellectual characters.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Verhoeven chose to outfit Smith's character Clarence Boddicker in [[rimless glasses]] because of their intellectual association, creating a disparity in the character that Verhoeven found akin to the similarly bespectacled [[Heinrich Himmler]].<ref>''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1478283/ Villains of Old Detroit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210225822/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1478283/# |date=2017-02-10 }}''.

The score alternates brass-heavy material, including the RoboCop theme and ED-209's theme, with more introverted pieces for strings, such as during RoboCop's homecoming scene. The music was performed by the [[Sinfonia of London]], conducted by [[Howard Blake]] and [[Tony Britten]]. The soundtrack initially was released by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] containing highlights from the score in an order different from that heard in the movie. The final four tracks were included on later CD re-issues.\n\nOn the theatrical trailer, the theme of ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) was used instead of the RoboCop theme. Similarly, the track Van Chase was used for the trailer of \"[[Dollman]]\". The theme song also made its way into the arcade and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] ''RoboCop'' video games.\n\nThe song \"Show Me Your Spine\" by [[PTP (band)|P.T.P.]] was played during the nightclub scene. P.T.P was a short-lived side project consisting of members of the band [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Skinny Puppy]]. However, this song was not available in any official form and could only be heard in the film. It was eventually released in 2004 on a compilation album called ''[[Side Trax]]'' by Ministry.\n\n==Design==\n===RoboCop===\nThe task of creating the RoboCop suit was given to [[Rob Bottin]].<ref name=\"The Atlantic Cities\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/04/robocop-statue-definitely-coming-detroit/1702/|title=RoboCop Statue 'Definitely' Coming to Detroit|last=Metcalfe|first=John|date=April 6, 2012|work=Comic Book Movie|accessdate=April 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408151228/http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/04/robocop-statue-definitely-coming-detroit/1702/#|archive-date=2012-04-08|url-status=live}}</ref> The studio decided that Bottin would be the ideal person to create the RoboCop suit, as he had just finished doing the special effects for John Carpenter's ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]''. A budget of up to one million dollars was allotted to the completion of the suit, making it the most expensive item on the set. A total of six suits were made: three intact and three showing damage.\n\nBottin himself had produced early design sketches for the suit's prototype that the studio accepted enthusiastically, albeit with the request of some minor adjustments. Rob, Paul Verhoeven, and Edward Neumeier came up with the concept of the suit being more of an outer shell, with very little of the actor's actual face being visible. Bottin explained the basis of the design:\n<blockquote>It's meant to look very speedy and aerodynamic. All the lines are measured to go on a slant{{spaced ndash}}forward, forward, forward! All the lines were geometric, and complement every shape on the body from all angles. When Verhoeven came on the project, he requested numerous design changes, additions to the suit which looked more like machine than man-like. I've never done so many conceptional drawings for a director in my entire life{{spaced ndash}}changing it, and changing it, and changing it!<ref name =Cinefantastique>{{cite journal |last= Bates|first= Dan|title=On Location with 'RoboCop' |journal=Cinefantastique |volume=18 |issue=1|editor1-first= Frederick S.|editor1-last= Clarke|date=December 1987 |pages=16\u201325}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, the design ended up bearing a closer resemblance to Bottin's original design:\n<blockquote>RoboCop looks the way he does because that's the way a man's body works! Although we went through fifty different variations, developing his character, everything came back to man-like. It's definitely a guy in the suit, which doesn't belittle it any.<ref name =Cinefantastique/></blockquote>\n\nThe suit itself was attached to the actor in sections. To wear the helmet, Peter Weller wore a [[bald cap]] that allowed the helmet to be removed easily. After almost 10 months of preparation, the RoboCop suit was completed based on life casts from Peter Weller and Bottin's six-foot clay models. The suit's color was supposed to be bright blue; however, it was given a more grayish tint to make it look more metallic and produce less glare on the camera when it was being filmed.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nPeter Weller had in the meantime hired Moni Yakim, the head of the Movement Department at [[Juilliard]], to help create an appropriate way for him to move his body while wearing the RoboCop suit.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} He and Moni had envisioned RoboCop moving like a snake, dancing around its targets very elusively. The suit, however, proved to be too heavy and cumbersome. Instead, at the suggestion of Moni, it was decided that they would slow down RoboCop's movements in order to make them more appealing and plausible. Filming stopped for three days, allowing Peter and Paul Verhoeven to discuss new movements for the suit.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe original gun for RoboCop was a [[Desert Eagle]], but this was deemed too small. A [[Beretta 93R]] was heavily modified by Ray Williams of Freshour Machine, Texas City, Texas, who extended the gun barrel to make it look bigger and more proportional to RoboCop's hand. The gun holster itself was a standalone piece that was not integrated into the suit. Off-screen technicians would operate the device on cue by pulling cables that would force the holster to open up and allow the gun to be placed inside.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe ED-209 [[stop motion]] model was designed by [[Craig Hayes]],<ref name=\"Duncan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cinefex.com/backissues/issue45.html|title=Clash of the Robotitans|last=Duncan|first=Jody|date=February 1991|work=[[Cinefex]]|accessdate=21 December 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000829034036/http://www.cinefex.com/backissues/issue45.html| archivedate=29 August 2000}}</ref> who also built the full size models, and animated by [[Phil Tippett]], a veteran stop-motion animator.<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> As one of the [[setpiece]]s of the movie, the ED-209's look and animated sequences were under the close supervision of director Paul Verhoeven, who sometimes acted out the robot's movements himself. ED-209 was voiced by producer Jon Davison. Davies and Tippett would go on to collaborate on many more projects.\n\nIn one scene, Emil attempts to run down RoboCop, but instead accidentally drives into a vat of [[toxic waste]], causing the flesh to melt off his face and hands.

To appease the requirements of the ratings board, Verhoeven reduced the blood and gore in the most violent scenes in the movie, including ED-209's shooting of Kinney in the boardroom, Bobby being shot in the leg, the Boddicker gang's execution of Murphy with shotguns, and the final battle with Boddicker. Verhoeven also added humorous commercials throughout the news broadcasts to lighten the mood and distract from the violent aspects of the movie (most of the commercials satirize various aspects of the American consumer culture, such as the commercial for the 6000 SUX sedan). After 11 original X ratings, the film was eventually given an R rating for graphic violence, strong language, and brief nudity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzBkjTxD1a0 |title=Backstory RoboCop AMC |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718170224/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzBkjTxD1a0 |archivedate=July 18, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\n''RoboCop'' was released in American theaters on July 17, 1987.

Criterion released the uncut \"director's edit\" on LaserDisc in 1996. In 1998, Criterion released it on [[DVD]], while [[Image Entertainment]] released the R-rated cinema version. The R-rated cinema version was slated to be released on [[Blu-ray]] by Sony in 2006. However, Sony pulled the Blu-ray just days before it was to be released. Only a handful of copies were released to the general public, mainly reviewers, making it very rare. It was re-released on Region 1 DVD in 2007 and on Blu-ray in 2010 as part of the Blu-ray ''Robocop'' Trilogy. A remastered Blu-ray edition was released in January 2014 to tie into the [[RoboCop (2014 film)|2014 remake]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RoboCop Blu-ray|date=January 5, 2014|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/RoboCop-Blu-ray/89781/|publisher=Blu-ray.com|access-date=2014-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122081746/http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/RoboCop-Blu-ray/89781/#|archive-date=2014-01-22|url-status=live}}</ref>\nThe original uncut version was included on the [[Criterion Collection]] LaserDisc and DVD of the film, the 2005 trilogy box set, and the 2007 anniversary edition\u2014the latter two were released by MGM and were unrated. The 2014 [[Blu-ray]] 4K master edition also features this unrated cut.\n\nRegarding the omitted scenes, Verhoeven stated on the 2007 anniversary edition DVD that he had wanted the violence to be \"over the top\", in an almost comical fashion (such as the scene involving the executive that is killed by ED-209, and Bob Morton immediately asking \"Somebody wanna call a goddamn paramedic?!\"). Verhoeven felt that the tone of the violence was more upsetting due to the deletions requested by the MPAA. An alternate network TV Version was also released. The stronger language was either deleted or dubbed over. Blood was kept to a minimum. And, instead of Boddicker running over Emil with his sedan, decapitating him in the process, he swerves around, and misses him.\n\nThe following scenes are presented in the uncut version of the movie which originally received an X Rating: \n*During the boardroom meeting, ED-209 continuously shoots Kinney, who falls back on a table. This scene is now extended slightly to show additional shots being fired and Kenny's body reacting to them. There is also a quick shot of ED-209's programmer unsuccessfully trying to shut it down by ripping out its power cord.\n*A brief alternate shot of Bobby being shot in the leg and the impact that follows before he's tossed out of the getaway van.\n*Murphy's death scene is the most altered scene in the movie. When his hand is shot off, Murphy gets up and a stump is seen where his hand used to be. His right arm is shown being shot off completely (in the theatrical version, Murphy is shown with one arm without any explanation). In the final seconds of his murder, the camera spins around Murphy as he writhes in pain, Clarence shoots him in the head, and a hole appears. This shot was achieved using a sophisticated [[animatronic]] puppet of Peter Weller controlled off-screen. An overhead shot also shows the bloody aftermath of what has happened to Murphy as Lewis looks on shocked at his dead body.\n*When Clarence Boddicker is stabbed in the neck, there is an alternate shot of him holding his neck as he turns around and blood spurts from the wound.\n\nOn November 26, 2019, Arrow video put out a special Blu-ray edition with new extras, both cuts of the film, a television version cut, and interviews with Nancy Allen and Julie Selzer. It uses the same 4K remaster MGM put out on their release back in 2014.<ref>{{Citation|title=RoboCop Blu-ray Release Date November 26, 2019|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/RoboCop-Blu-ray/251851/|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref>\n\n===Cinematic analysis===\nIn a 2013 interview, Edward Neumeier reflected on how the film's script is starting to play into reality: \"We are now living in the world that I was proposing in ''RoboCop'' ... how [[Evil corporation|big corporations]] will 'take care of us' and ... how they won't.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/robocop-dystopia-detroit.html#.VBHewmRdX2I |title=Hamptoninstitution.org |access-date=2014-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911215854/http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/robocop-dystopia-detroit.html#.VBHewmRdX2I#.VBHewmRdX2I |archive-date=2014-09-11 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/25/business/robocop-neumeier-detroit-bankruptcy/index.html# |title=CNN |access-date=2014-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912002743/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/25/business/robocop-neumeier-detroit-bankruptcy/index.html# |archive-date=2014-09-12 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.guernicamag.com/features/austerity-economics-is-like-a-kick-in-the-groin/# |title=Guernicamag.com |access-date=2014-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912000443/http://www.guernicamag.com/features/austerity-economics-is-like-a-kick-in-the-groin/# |archive-date=2014-09-12 |url-status=live |date=2014-06-02 }}</ref>\n\nTwo of the primary themes explored by ''RoboCop'' are the media and human nature. On the Criterion Edition DVD commentary track, executive producer Jon Davison and writer Edward Neumeier both relate the film to the decay of American industry from the 1970s through the early 1980s, with the abandoned \"[[Rust Belt]] style\" factories that RoboCop and Clarence Boddicker's gang use as hideouts reflecting this concern. Massive unemployment is prevalent, being reported frequently on the news, as are poverty and the crime that results from economic hardship.\n\nDirector Paul Verhoeven, known for his heavy use of [[Christian symbolism]], states in the documentary ''Flesh and Steel: The Making of RoboCop'' (featured on the ''RoboCop'' DVD) that his intention was to portray RoboCop as a [[Christ]] figure. This is represented in Murphy's horrific death alluding to the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], his return alluding to the [[resurrection of Jesus]], and the showdown with Clarence Boddicker at the steel mill, which finds RoboCop trudging through ankle-deep water, which alludes to [[Jesus walking on water]].\n\n[[Darian Leader]] considers ''RoboCop'' one example of how the cinema has dealt with the concept of masculinity, showing that to be a man requires more than having the body of a man: something symbolic that is not ultimately human must be added. He sees ''RoboCop'' as similar to ''[[The Terminator]]'' and ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' in this respect. Leader wrote of ''RoboCop'': <blockquote>The RoboCop is a family man who is destroyed by thugs, then rebuilt as a robot by science. His son always insists, before the transformation, that his human father perform the gun spinning trick he sees on TV. When the robot can finally do this properly, he is no longer just a male biological body: he is a body plus machinery, a body which includes within it the symbolic circuitry of science. Old heroes had bits of metal ''outside'' them (knights), but modern heroes have bits of metal ''inside'' them. To be a man today thus involves this kind of real incorporation of symbolic properties.<ref name=\"Leader\">{{cite book |last= Leader |first= Darian |title=Why do women write more letters than they post? |publisher=Faber & Faber |location=London |year=1996 |pages=28 |isbn=978-0-571-17619-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPhilosopher and cultural critic [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] wrote that:\n<blockquote>''RoboCop'', a futuristic story about a policeman shot to death and then revived after all parts of his body have been replaced by artificial substitutes, introduces a more tragic note: the hero who finds himself literally \"between two deaths\"{{spaced ndash}}clinically dead and at the same time provided with a new, mechanical body\u2014starts to remember fragments of his previous, \"human\" life and thus undergoes a process of resubjectivication, changing gradually back from pure incarnated drive to a being of desire. ... [I]f there is a phenomenon that fully deserves to be called the \"fundamental fantasy of contemporary mass culture,\" it is this fantasy of the return of the living dead: the fantasy of a person who does not want to stay dead but returns again and again to pose a threat to the living.<ref name =\"Slavoj \u017di\u017eek\">{{cite book|author=\u017di\u017eek, Slavoj |title=Looking Awry: an Introduction to Jacques Lacan through Popular Culture|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|year=1992|pages=22|isbn=978-0-262-74015-9}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe depiction of Murphy's struggles in reasserting his humanity also deals with themes of identity. This is even touched upon in the cyborg's construction. On the ''Robocop: 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD'', Paul Sammon states:\n<blockquote>Rob Bottin and  Paul Verhoeven, and Ed Neumeier had all come up with a concept that there would be such a potential for psychological disruption. Even if you had supposedly wiped someone's memories and emotions they'd still might have some kind of residual humanity where, if they'd looked at themselves as a complete robot with no relation to their past organic form, they'd completely freak out and have a psychotic breakdown. So the idea was that surgeons had literally skinned off Alex Murphy's face and then placed it on the cyborg. So it's not like they transplanted his head, they just took his face off and laid it on the cyborg, and that was to give him his own little sense of identity.<ref name=\"FandS\">''RoboCop 20th Anniversary Edition DVD''</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Lasting reception===\nIn 2007, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named the film the 14th greatest action film of all time,<ref>{{cite web|title=The 25 Greatest Action Movies Ever!|url=https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,20041669_20041686_20042607_12,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=April 17, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221132614/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20041669_20041686_20042607_12,00.html#|archive-date=2009-02-21|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] rated it as the 19th best action film of all time in 2016.<ref name=complex/>  In 2008, it was selected by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine as one of ''The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time'', placing at #404.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time |url=https://empireonline.com/500/18.asp |magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016234611/http://www.empireonline.com/500/18.asp# |archive-date=2012-10-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''The New York Times'' also included the film in their list of ''The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made''.<ref>{{cite news | title = The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made | url = https://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/1000best.html | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = April 29, 2003 | accessdate = May 22, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131211043539/http://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/1000best.html# | archive-date = 2013-12-11 | url-status = live }}</ref>  [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC Filmsite.org]] and [[Film.com]] rated it as one of the best films of 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/1987.html |title=Greatest Films of 1987 |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC Filmsite.org]] |accessdate=April 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111024733/http://www.filmsite.org/1987.html# |archive-date=2010-01-11 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2756553/the-10-best-movies-of-1987-rave-rentals-from-the-year-of-the-robocop/ |title=The 10 Best Movies of 1987 |publisher=[[RealNetworks|Film.com]] |date=August 2, 2007 |accessdate=April 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016164903/http://www.mtv.com/news/2756553/the-10-best-movies-of-1987-rave-rentals-from-the-year-of-the-robocop/# |archive-date=2018-10-16 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe film was on the ballot for two of the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI 100 Years ... series|100 Series]]'' lists.
