(2008) excluded linkage to both the FRAS1 and FREM2 genes, indicating genetic heterogeneity.\n\n==Molecular genetics==\nIn 5 families with Fraser syndrome, McGregor et al. (2003) identified 5 homozygous mutations in the FRAS1 gene (e.g., 607830.0001), which encodes a putative extracellular matrix (ECM) protein.\n\nIn 2 families with Fraser syndrome unlinked to the FRAS1 gene, Jadeja et al. (2005) found a homozygous missense mutation in the FREM2 gene (608945.0001).\n\nIn an infant girl with Fraser syndrome, Slavotinek et al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for a deletion (607830.0006) and an insertion (607830.0007) in the FRAS1 gene, inherited from her mother and her father, respectively.\n\nCavalcanti et al. (2007) described 2 stillborn Brazilian male sibs, born at 25 and 29 weeks' gestation, respectively. One sib appeared to have a lethal form of ablepharon-macrostomia syndrome (AMS; 200110) or an intermediate phenotype between AMS and Fraser syndrome, and the other had classic Fraser syndrome. Analysis of the FRAS1 gene revealed homozygosity for a splice site mutation (607830.0008), resulting in a severely truncated protein in both sibs and heterozygosity for the mutation in both parents. Cavalcanti et al. (2007) concluded that a phenotype resembling AMS is a rare clinical expression of Fraser syndrome, with no obvious genotype/phenotype correlation.\n\nIn a female fetus with a normal karyotype and cryptophthalmos, ambiguous external genitalia, syndactyly, bilobed lungs, bilateral renal agenesis, hypoplastic bladder, and agenesis of internal genitalia with streak ovaries, Shafeghati et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a splice site mutation in the FREM2 gene (608945.0002). The consanguineous Iranian parents were heterozygous for the mutation. An earlier pregnancy had resulted in the intrauterine death at 30 weeks of gestation of a male fetus with a normal karyotype in whom the diagnosis of Fraser syndrome was suggested by the presence of cryptophthalmos, syndactyly, ambiguous genitalia, imperforate anus, bilateral renal agenesis, pulmonary hypoplasia, and hydrocephalus. The authors noted that the findings in the sibs were consistent with classic Fraser syndrome.\n\nAmong 18 consanguineous families with Fraser syndrome, van Haelst et al. (2008) found 9 families with linkage to FRAS1, 3 families to FREM2, and 3 families to both genes. Six families did not link to either locus, indicating genetic heterogeneity. Among a larger group of 33 families, including the 18 consanguineous families, molecular analysis identified 11 novel mutations in the FRAS1 gene in 10 families and 1 mutation in the FREM2 gene (608945.0003) in 1 family. A literature review of genotype/phenotype correlations suggested that patients with FRAS1 mutations have more frequent skull ossification defects and a low insertion of the umbilical cord compared to patients without a FRAS1 mutation, but the findings were not statistically significant.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:FraserCT.gif|thumb|[[Magnet Resonance Tomography|MRI]] revealed microphthalmos in the left ocular globe and a [[coloboma]]-like structure in the right in a female infant with Fraser syndrome.]]\nThe diagnosis of this syndrome can be made on [[clinical examination]] and [[perinatal]] [[autopsy]].<ref name=\"kalpana kumari\"/>\n\nKoenig and Spranger (1986) noted that eye lesions are apparently nonobligatory components of the syndrome. The diagnosis of Fraser syndrome should be entertained in patients with a combination of acrofacial and urogenital malformations with or without cryptophthalmos. Thomas et al. (1986) also emphasized the occurrence of the cryptophthalmos syndrome without cryptophthalmos and proposed diagnostic criteria for Fraser syndrome. Major criteria consisted of cryptophthalmos, syndactyly, abnormal genitalia, and positive family history. Minor criteria were congenital malformation of the nose, ears, or larynx, cleft lip and/or palate, skeletal defects, umbilical hernia, renal agenesis, and mental retardation. Diagnosis was based on the presence of at least 2 major and 1 minor criteria, or 1 major and 4 minor criteria.\n\nBoyd et al. (1988) suggested that prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound examination of eyes, digits, and kidneys should detect the severe form of the syndrome. Serville et al. (1989) demonstrated the feasibility of ultrasonographic diagnosis of the Fraser syndrome at 18 weeks' gestation. They suggested that the diagnosis could be made if 2 of the following signs are present: obstructive uropathy, microphthalmia, syndactyly, and oligohydramnios. Schauer et al. (1990) made the diagnosis at 18.5 weeks' gestation on the basis of sonography. Both the female fetus and the phenotypically normal father had a chromosome anomaly: inv(9)(p11q21). An earlier born infant had Fraser syndrome and the same chromosome 9 inversion.\n\nVan Haelst et al. (2007) provided a revision of the diagnostic criteria for Fraser syndrome according to Thomas et al. (1986) through the addition of airway tract and urinary tract anomalies to the major criteria and removal of mental retardation and clefting as criteria. Major criteria included syndactyly, cryptophthalmos spectrum, urinary tract abnormalities, ambiguous genitalia, laryngeal and tracheal anomalies, and positive family history. Minor criteria included anorectal defects, dysplastic ears, skull ossification defects, umbilical abnormalities, and nasal anomalies. Cleft lip and/or palate, cardiac malformations, musculoskeletal anomalies, and mental retardation were considered uncommon. Van Haelst et al. (2007) suggested that the diagnosis of Fraser syndrome can be made if either 3 major criteria, or 2 major and 2 minor criteria, or 1 major and 3 minor criteria are present in a patient.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe incidence of Fraser syndrome is 0.043 per 10,000 live born infants and 1.1 in 10,000 stillbirths, making it a rare syndrome.<ref name=\"pmid18334805\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Narang M, Kumar M, Shah D | title = Fraser-cryptophthalmos syndrome with colonic atresia | journal = Indian J Pediatr | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 189\u201391 |date=February 2008 | pmid = 18334805 | doi = 10.1007/s12098-008-0030-9| url = }}<!--| accessdate = 2009-04-06--></ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = 32241\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|Q|87|0|q|87}}\n| ICD9            = \n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = 219000\n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = \n| eMedicineTopic  = \n| MeshID          = \n| SNOMED CT       = 204102004\n| Orphanet        = 2052\n}}\n[[Category:Autosomal recessive disorders]]\n[[Category:Syndromes affecting the eyes]]\n[[Category:Syndromes with mental retardation]]\n[[Category:Rare syndromes]]\n[[Category:Syndromes affecting female reproductive system]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the anatomical abnormality observed in 1964|Frasier syndrome}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Fraser syndrome\n| synonyms        = \n| image           = Fraser syndrome.gif\n| caption         = Bilateral [[cryptophthalmos]] with [[microphthalmos]] in the left ocular globe and abnormal right ocular globe in a female infant with Fraser syndrome.\n| pronounce       = \n| field           = \n| width           = 200\n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Fraser syndrome''' (also known as '''Meyer-Schwickerath's syndrome''', '''Fraser-Fran\u00e7ois syndrome''', or '''Ullrich-Feichtiger syndrome''') is an [[autosomal]] [[recessive]] [[congenital disorder]].<ref>Jules Fran\u00e7ois.

(2007) concluded that a phenotype resembling AMS is a rare clinical expression of Fraser syndrome, with no obvious genotype/phenotype correlation.\n\nIn a female fetus with a normal karyotype and cryptophthalmos, ambiguous external genitalia, syndactyly, bilobed lungs, bilateral renal agenesis, hypoplastic bladder, and agenesis of internal genitalia with streak ovaries, Shafeghati et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a splice site mutation in the FREM2 gene (608945.0002). The consanguineous Iranian parents were heterozygous for the mutation. An earlier pregnancy had resulted in the intrauterine death at 30 weeks of gestation of a male fetus with a normal karyotype in whom the diagnosis of Fraser syndrome was suggested by the presence of cryptophthalmos, syndactyly, ambiguous genitalia, imperforate anus, bilateral renal agenesis, pulmonary hypoplasia, and hydrocephalus. The authors noted that the findings in the sibs were consistent with classic Fraser syndrome.\n\nAmong 18 consanguineous families with Fraser syndrome, van Haelst et al. (2008) found 9 families with linkage to FRAS1, 3 families to FREM2, and 3 families to both genes. Six families did not link to either locus, indicating genetic heterogeneity. Among a larger group of 33 families, including the 18 consanguineous families, molecular analysis identified 11 novel mutations in the FRAS1 gene in 10 families and 1 mutation in the FREM2 gene (608945.0003) in 1 family. A literature review of genotype/phenotype correlations suggested that patients with FRAS1 mutations have more frequent skull ossification defects and a low insertion of the umbilical cord compared to patients without a FRAS1 mutation, but the findings were not statistically significant.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:FraserCT.gif|thumb|[[Magnet Resonance Tomography|MRI]] revealed microphthalmos in the left ocular globe and a [[coloboma]]-like structure in the right in a female infant with Fraser syndrome.]]\nThe diagnosis of this syndrome can be made on [[clinical examination]] and [[perinatal]] [[autopsy]].<ref name=\"kalpana kumari\"/>\n\nKoenig and Spranger (1986) noted that eye lesions are apparently nonobligatory components of the syndrome. The diagnosis of Fraser syndrome should be entertained in patients with a combination of acrofacial and urogenital malformations with or without cryptophthalmos. Thomas et al. (1986) also emphasized the occurrence of the cryptophthalmos syndrome without cryptophthalmos and proposed diagnostic criteria for Fraser syndrome. Major criteria consisted of cryptophthalmos, syndactyly, abnormal genitalia, and positive family history. Minor criteria were congenital malformation of the nose, ears, or larynx, cleft lip and/or palate, skeletal defects, umbilical hernia, renal agenesis, and mental retardation. Diagnosis was based on the presence of at least 2 major and 1 minor criteria, or 1 major and 4 minor criteria.\n\nBoyd et al. (1988) suggested that prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound examination of eyes, digits, and kidneys should detect the severe form of the syndrome. Serville et al. (1989) demonstrated the feasibility of ultrasonographic diagnosis of the Fraser syndrome at 18 weeks' gestation. They suggested that the diagnosis could be made if 2 of the following signs are present: obstructive uropathy, microphthalmia, syndactyly, and oligohydramnios. Schauer et al. (1990) made the diagnosis at 18.5 weeks' gestation on the basis of sonography. Both the female fetus and the phenotypically normal father had a chromosome anomaly: inv(9)(p11q21). An earlier born infant had Fraser syndrome and the same chromosome 9 inversion.\n\nVan Haelst et al. (2007) provided a revision of the diagnostic criteria for Fraser syndrome according to Thomas et al. (1986) through the addition of airway tract and urinary tract anomalies to the major criteria and removal of mental retardation and clefting as criteria. Major criteria included syndactyly, cryptophthalmos spectrum, urinary tract abnormalities, ambiguous genitalia, laryngeal and tracheal anomalies, and positive family history. Minor criteria included anorectal defects, dysplastic ears, skull ossification defects, umbilical abnormalities, and nasal anomalies. Cleft lip and/or palate, cardiac malformations, musculoskeletal anomalies, and mental retardation were considered uncommon. Van Haelst et al. (2007) suggested that the diagnosis of Fraser syndrome can be made if either 3 major criteria, or 2 major and 2 minor criteria, or 1 major and 3 minor criteria are present in a patient.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe incidence of Fraser syndrome is 0.043 per 10,000 live born infants and 1.1 in 10,000 stillbirths, making it a rare syndrome.<ref name=\"pmid18334805\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Narang M, Kumar M, Shah D | title = Fraser-cryptophthalmos syndrome with colonic atresia | journal = Indian J Pediatr | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 189\u201391 |date=February 2008 | pmid = 18334805 | doi = 10.1007/s12098-008-0030-9| url = }}<!--| accessdate = 2009-04-06--></ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB      = 32241  \n|  ICD10           = {{ICD10|Q|87|0|q|87}} \n|  ICD9            =  \n|  ICDO            =  \n|  OMIM            = 219000  \n|  MedlinePlus     =  \n|  eMedicineSubj   =  \n|  eMedicineTopic  =  \n|  MeshID          = \n}}\n[[Category:Autosomal recessive disorders]]\n[[Category:Syndromes affecting the eyes]]\n[[Category:Syndromes with mental retardation]]\n[[Category:Rare syndromes]]\n[[Category:Syndromes affecting female reproductive system]]\n", "name_user": "Dismanet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding new medical resources.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_syndrome"}

When Primrose Everdeen is 'reaped', her older sister Katniss Everdeen volunteers in her place to enter the games and is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts when she's pitted against highly-trained tributes from all of the other districts and has to think quick on her feet to survive and not die.\n\n===''The Hunger Games: Catching Fire'' (2013)===\n{{Main|The Hunger Games: Catching Fire}}\nAlong with fellow District 12 victor Peeta Mellark, Katniss Everdeen returns home safely after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

Along the way Katniss senses a rebellion simmering upon the capitol - one that she and Peeta may have sparked  - but the Capitol is still in control as President Snow prepares the 75th Hunger Games - the Third Quarter Quell - that could change Panem forever.

The franchise has grossed overall over $446 million against a combined production budget of $35.5 million.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe films and the television series, which were created and developed by [[James DeMonaco]], are presenting a near-future [[Dystopia|dystopian]] [[America]] which celebrates an annual national holiday known as the Purge, in which all crimes, including murder, are legal for a 12-hour period, while others are fighting for their lives. The Purge was enacted by a new political party, the New Founding Fathers of America, or NFFA for short, as an act desperation after an economic collapse and recession, however, in the installment [[The First Purge]], it\u2019s revealed that the NFFA\u2019s intent with the holiday, is to kill off the poor in an attempt to minimize the amount of people on government assistance. The First Purge, depicts a trial run of the Purge in [[New York City]] and is first in the timeline of events in the series, despite being the most recent film released. The first Purge film, [[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]] takes places after The Purge has gone nation-wide. The next Purge film in the timeline, and the second to be released, was [[The Purge: Anarchy]] which depicts the purge being turned into an opportunity for para-military groups to go into poor parts of cities to kill the residents who cannot afford to protect themselves. The third installment, and final installment in regards the Purge timeline, is [[The Purge: Election Year]]. In Election Year, a presidential candidate, who is a senator during the beginning of the film, is running on the platform of ending the annual purge with an executive order after losing her entire family as a teenager on purge night.

The family of four lives in an affluent [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood and, along with their neighbors, show their patriotism and support for the national holiday by displaying blue flowers on their front stoops. The Sandins bunker down into their home to wait out the ensuing violence of the next twelve hours caused by revelers \"purging\" their unproductive emotions of hate, jealousy, and rage in a flurry of state-sanctioned mayhem, destruction, and murder. Citizens rationalize the suffering, which critics call socio-economically unbalanced, by citing the country's unprecedented peace, prosperity, and wealth. \n\nThe Sandin home, protected by an ostensibly high-quality security system sold far and wide by the family's father and head of household, becomes the target of a masked group of young holiday \"Purgers\" whose economically disadvantaged and severely wounded victim, referred to as homeless by the leader, escapes and is given refuge by the youngest child of the Sandin family. Frustrated by the interruption of their ritual sacrifice, the sadistic gang leader unmasks himself and threatens the entire family with murder if they don't surrender the man within the hour, or whenever reinforcements arrive with the equipment they need to bust through the barricades. After initially trying to capture the man and leave him to suffer his fate with the purgers, the family decides to help the man whose pain is no longer remote and can't be ignored, thus opening themselves up to accusations of unpatriotism. The purgers manage to break in and brutal fighting ensues with casualties on both sides. Losing their advantage, the family is about to be killed until they are \"saved\" by their neighbors, who blast away the remaining purgers to then announce that the Sandins' lives are their neighbors' to take. Facing execution by former friends, the stranger, who managed to escape most of the fighting, helps the Sandins by disarming the jealous neighbors. Faced with the choice of killing their neighbors, which in this world would be well within their rights, the family decides to hold them hostage until Purge night is over, further highlighting their unwilllingnessless to participate in the killing holiday.\n\nDespite mixed reviews, the film grossed $89.3 million during its run, far surpassing its $3 million budget.

After a betrayal within the government targets her for death minutes after the Purge's commencement, Barnes must protect Roan while on the run for safety until they meet and form an alliance with some of her supporters; two shopkeepers, an EMT, and an anti-Purge rebel team headed by the wounded Stranger from the first two films, whose real name is Dante Bishop. Meanwhile, NFFA candidate and Roan's rival, Minister Edwidge Owens, leads the NFFA in committing more acts of violence during Purge night as rebels try to protect more citizens.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and went on to gross over $118 million worldwide against a budget of $10 million, becoming the second highest-grossing film of the series.\n\n===''The First Purge'' (2018)===\n{{main|The First Purge}}\nIn September 2016, James DeMonaco, who wrote and directed every film in the series thus far, stated that the fourth film would be a prequel to the trilogy.

The organization establishes a new [[totalitarian government]] and a [[police state]]. In 2016, the NFFA devises a plan to help stabilize American society and later in 2017, the 28th Amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S Constitution]] is ratified. This amendment establishes a 12-hour event known as \"The Purge\" which would take place from 7:00 in the evening of March 21, 2017 to 7:00 in the morning of March 22, 2017 wherein all crime including murder becomes legal. Before the Purge begins, the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] is activated with rules and a prayer saying \"Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn\" before ending with \"May God be with you all\".\n\nThe rules for the annual Purge are as follows:\n* Sirens blare throughout the land to signal the start and end of The Purge.\n* All police, fire, and medical emergency services remain unavailable or suspended for the twelve-hour Purge.\n* Government officials of ranking 10 or higher are granted immunity (revoked in ''Election Year'' to legalize the murder of a political opponent).\n* \"Class 1-4\" weaponry are permitted for use while \"Class 5\" weaponry (explosive devices such as grenades, rocket launchers, bazookas, etc., weapons of mass destruction, and viral/biological and chemical agents) is prohibited.\n* Public hanging is the penalty for violators of any rules.\n\nBelow is how the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] announces the Purge' commencement in the first two films:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Government officials of ranking 10 have been granted immunity from the Purge and shall not be harmed.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Police, fire, and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m., when The Purge concludes.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]'' (taking place 20 years after the establishment of The Purge), the rule granting immunity to ranking 10 officials is revoked by the NFFA in order to assassinate Roan, an anti-Purge Presidential candidate who runs on a platform of overturning the 28th Amendment which, to the NFFA's distress, has achieved parity in the polls with their candidate. This change is reflected in the announcement of the final Purge's commencement as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge, sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Police, fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 am.''\n'''''And, for the first time since its inception, no one has been granted special immunity from the Purge. No citizen or group will be exempt.'''''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''[[The First Purge]]'', taking place in 2017 on [[Staten Island]], [[New York City|New York]], which was blocked off from all contact due to the First Purge really being a social experiment conducted by the New Founding Fathers, providing monetary compensation of at least $5,000 to anyone who decides to stay on the island for the night, one year prior to the first nationwide Purge. Below shows the commencement speech as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n'''''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the NFFA Social Experiment on Staten Island, New York.'''''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the experiment.''\n''Any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Staten Island Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nWithin the film series, the Purge has resulted in crime and unemployment rates plummeting to 1% and a strong economy. Although it is thought to be used as an act of catharsis for the U.S. populace, it is actually used as a method of artificial [[Human population planning|population control]], as the unemployed poor in slum neighborhoods as well as some working-class people are usually the main targets; in ''Election Year'', a character notes that sneaking up on a black man on Purge night is a particularly foolish action, suggesting that black people are used to being targets on this night. By this time it has also increased tourism as foreigners enter the US solely to participate in the Purge.\n\nThe event was ended 3 months later from the main events of the third film.\n\n==Characters==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; float:center; padding:5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''Key'''</center>\n* A {{note label|Young|Y}} indicates the actor portrayed the role of a younger version of the character.\n* A {{note label|Voice|V}} indicates the actor or actress lent only their voice for their character.\n* A dark gray cell indicates the character was not in the film.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:19.286%;\"| Character\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Film\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Television series\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:16.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| ''[[The First Purge]]''\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Purge (TV series)|The Purge]]''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 1 (2018)|Season 1]]\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 2 (2019)|Season 2]]\n|-\n!

The films present a near-future [[Dystopia|dystopian]] [[America]] which celebrates an annual national holiday known as the Purge, in which all crimes, including murder, are legal for a 12-hour period.  \n\nThe franchise began in 2013 with ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]'', directed by the franchise creator DeMonaco, who also directed two of the sequels and wrote the screenplays for all, including the yet-unnamed Purge 5 which, he has hinted in interviews, could be the end of the franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/05/13/purge-5-release-date/|title='The Purge 5' to be released next year|website=EW.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref> In addition to films, the franchise has spawned [[The Purge (TV series)|a television series]] which premiered on September 4, 2018; DeMonaco wrote its pilot episode.   \n\nThe franchise has received a generally mixed critical reception, mainly for the screenwriting and clich\u00e9d stories, but was praised for the concept, acting, style and action sequences. The franchise has grossed overall over $446 million against a combined production budget of $35.5 million.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe films and the television series, which were created and developed by [[James DeMonaco]], are presenting a near-future [[Dystopia|dystopian]] [[America]] which celebrates an annual national holiday known as the Purge, in which all crimes, including murder, are legal for a 12-hour period, while others are fighting for their lives. The Purge was enacted by a new political party, the New Founding Fathers of America, or NFFA for short, as an act desperation after an economic collapse and recession, however, in the installment [[The First Purge]], it\u2019s revealed that the NFFA\u2019s intent with the holiday, is to kill off the poor in an attempt to minimize the amount of people on government assistance. The First Purge, depicts a trial run of the Purge in [[New York City]] and is first in the timeline of events in the series, despite being the most recent film released. The first Purge film, [[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]] takes places after The Purge has gone nation-wide. The next Purge film in the timeline, and the second to be released, was [[The Purge: Anarchy]] which depicts the purge being turned into an opportunity for para-military groups to go into poor parts of cities to kill the residents who cannot afford to protect themselves. The third installment, and final installment in regards the Purge timeline, is [[The Purge: Election Year]]. In Election Year, a presidential candidate, who is a senator during the beginning of the film, is running on the platform of ending the annual purge with an executive order after losing her entire family as a teenager on purge night. The Purge featured in Election Year, was the first one were politicians were not immune, which was an attempt by the NFFA to have her killed in the hopes it would keep the annual purge going. The [[The Purge (TV series)|TV series]], never reveals where it fits in the timeline of the films and was a complete [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] not in line with any of the films.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Producer(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2013|6|7}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[James DeMonaco]]\n| rowspan=\"5\" | James DeMonaco\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[Jason Blum]], [[Michael Bay]], [[Andrew Form]], [[Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller]] and Sebastien Lemercier\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2014|7|18}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2016|7|1}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The First Purge]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2018|7|4}}\n| Gerard McMurray\n| Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Brad Fuller, Sebastien Lemercier and James DeMonaco\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''Untitled Purge Sequel''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2020|7|10}}*\n|Everardo Gout<ref name=\"Everardo Gout\" />\n| Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller and Sebastien Lemercier\n|}\n\n{{small|*Expected release date.

The family of four lives in an affluent [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood and, along with their neighbors, show their patriotism and support for the national holiday by displaying blue flowers on their front stoops. The Sandins bunker down into their home to wait out the ensuing violence of the next twelve hours caused by revelers \"purging\" their unproductive emotions of hate, jealousy, and rage in a flurry of state-sanctioned mayhem, destruction, and murder. Citizens rationalize the suffering, which critics call socio-economically unbalanced, by citing the country's unprecedented peace, prosperity, and wealth. \n\nThe Sandin home, protected by an ostensibly high-quality security system sold far and wide by the family's father and head of household, becomes the target of a masked group of young holiday \"Purgers\" whose economically disadvantaged and severely wounded victim, referred to as homeless by the leader, escapes and is given refuge by the youngest child of the Sandin family. Frustrated by the interruption of their ritual sacrifice, the sadistic gang leader unmasks himself and threatens the entire family with murder if they don't surrender the man within the hour, or whenever reinforcements arrive with the equipment they need to bust through the barricades. After initially trying to capture the man and leave him to suffer his fate with the purgers, the family decides to help the man whose pain is no longer remote and can't be ignored, thus opening themselves up to accusations of unpatriotism. The purgers manage to break in and brutal fighting ensues with casualties on both sides. Losing their advantage, the family is about to be killed until they are \"saved\" by their neighbors, who blast away the remaining purgers to then announce that the Sandins' lives are their neighbors' to take. Facing execution by former friends, the stranger, who managed to escape most of the fighting, helps the Sandins by disarming the jealous neighbors. Faced with the choice of killing their neighbors, which in this world would be well within their rights, the family decides to hold them hostage until Purge night is over, further highlighting their unwilllingnessless to participate in the killing holiday.\n\nDespite mixed reviews, the film grossed $89.3 million during its run, far surpassing its $3 million budget. The film was turned into a [[Halloween Horror Nights#Scare zones|scare zone]] in 2014 for [[Universal Parks & Resorts]] annual [[Halloween Horror Nights]] due to its success.\n\n===''The Purge: Anarchy'' (2014)===\n{{main|The Purge: Anarchy}}\n'''''The Purge: Anarchy''''', released worldwide on July 18, 2014,<ref name=\"Release\">{{cite news |title=Universal Re-Slots ''The Purge: Anarchy'' |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/02/universal-re-slots-the-purge-anarchy |accessdate=1 March 2014 |newspaper=Deadline.com |date=28 February 2014}}</ref> stars [[Frank Grillo]], [[Carmen Ejogo]], [[Zach Gilford]], [[Kiele Sanchez]], [[Zo\u00eb Soul]] and [[Michael K.

After a betrayal within the government targets her for death minutes after the Purge's commencement, Barnes must protect Roan while on the run for safety until they meet and form an alliance with some of her supporters; two shopkeepers, an EMT, and an anti-Purge rebel team headed by the wounded Stranger from the first two films, whose real name is Dante Bishop.

The organization establishes a new [[totalitarian government]] and a [[police state]]. In 2016, the NFFA devises a plan to help stabilize American society and later in 2017, the 28th Amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S Constitution]] is ratified. This amendment establishes a 12-hour event known as \"The Purge\" which would take place from 7:00 in the evening of March 21, 2017 to 7:00 in the morning of March 22, 2017 wherein all crime including murder becomes legal. Before the Purge begins, the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] is activated with rules and a prayer saying \"Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn\" before ending with \"May God be with you all\".\n\nThe rules for the annual Purge are as follows:\n* Sirens blare throughout the land to signal the start and end of The Purge.\n* All police, fire, and medical emergency services remain unavailable or suspended for the twelve-hour Purge.\n* Government officials of ranking 10 or higher are granted immunity (revoked in ''Election Year'' to legalize the murder of a political opponent).\n* \"Class 1-4\" weaponry are permitted for use while \"Class 5\" weaponry (explosive devices such as grenades, rocket launchers, bazookas, etc., weapons of mass destruction, and viral/biological and chemical agents) is prohibited.\n* Public hanging is the penalty for violators of any rules.\n\nBelow is how the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] announces the Purge' commencement in the first two films:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Government officials of ranking 10 have been granted immunity from the Purge and shall not be harmed.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Police, fire, and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m., when The Purge concludes.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]'' (taking place 20 years after the establishment of The Purge), the rule granting immunity to ranking 10 officials is revoked by the NFFA in order to assassinate Roan, an anti-Purge Presidential candidate who runs on a platform of overturning the 28th Amendment which, to the NFFA's distress, has achieved parity in the polls with their candidate. This change is reflected in the announcement of the final Purge's commencement as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge, sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Police, fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 am.''\n'''''And, for the first time since its inception, no one has been granted special immunity from the Purge. No citizen or group will be exempt.'''''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''[[The First Purge]]'', taking place in 2017 on [[Staten Island]], [[New York City|New York]], which was blocked off from all contact due to the First Purge really being a social experiment conducted by the New Founding Fathers, providing monetary compensation of at least $5,000 to anyone who decides to stay on the island for the night, one year prior to the first nationwide Purge. Below shows the commencement speech as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n'''''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the NFFA Social Experiment on Staten Island, New York.'''''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the experiment.''\n''Any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Staten Island Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nWithin the film series, the Purge has resulted in crime and unemployment rates plummeting to 1% and a strong economy. Although it is thought to be used as an act of catharsis for the U.S. populace, it is actually used as a method of artificial [[Human population planning|population control]], as the unemployed poor in slum neighborhoods as well as some working-class people are usually the main targets; in ''Election Year'', a character notes that sneaking up on a black man on Purge night is a particularly foolish action, suggesting that black people are used to being targets on this night. By this time it has also increased tourism as foreigners enter the US solely to participate in the Purge.\n\nThe event was ended 3 months later from the main events of the third film.\n\n==Characters==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; float:center; padding:5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''Key'''</center>\n* A {{note label|Young|Y}} indicates the actor portrayed the role of a younger version of the character.\n* A {{note label|Voice|V}} indicates the actor or actress lent only their voice for their character.\n* A dark gray cell indicates the character was not in the film.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:19.286%;\"| Character\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Film\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Television series\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:16.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| ''[[The First Purge]]''\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Purge (TV series)|The Purge]]''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 1 (2018)|Season 1]]\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 2 (2019)|Season 2]]\n|-\n!

Diagnosis is usually by clinical observation, often with the assistance of family medical histories so that it can be determined whether transmission is [[autosomal dominant]] or [[recessive]].\n\nWorldwide, around 7,000 people have been diagnosed with an ectodermal dysplasia condition. Some ED conditions are only present in single family units and derive from very recent mutations. Ectodermal dysplasias can occur in any race but are much more prevalent in [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] than any other group and especially in fair Caucasians.\n\nEctodermal dysplasias are described as \"heritable conditions in which there are abnormalities of two or more ectodermal structures such as the [[hair]], [[teeth]], [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], [[sweat glands]], [[salivary glands]], cranial-facial structure, digits and other parts of the body.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ectodermaldysplasia.org | title=Ectodermal Dysplasia Society}}</ref>\n\n== Presentation ==\n\n=== Hair ===\nIndividuals affected by an ED syndrome frequently have abnormalities of the hair follicles. Scalp and body hair may be thin, sparse, and very light in color, even though beard growth in affected males may be normal. The hair may grow very slowly or sporadically and it may be excessively fragile, curly, or even twisted. Kinky hair is also a possibility.\n\n=== Nails ===\nFingernails and toenails may be thick, abnormally shaped, discolored, ridged, slow-growing, or brittle. The cuticles may be prone to infections.\n\n=== Skin ===\nThe skin may be lightly pigmented. Skin sustaining injury may grow back permanently hypo-pigmented. In some cases, red or brown pigmentation may be present. Skin can be prone to rashes or infections and can be thick over the palms and soles. Care must be taken to prevent cracking, bleeding, and infection.\n\n=== Sweat glands ===\nIndividuals affected by certain ED syndromes cannot [[Perspiration|perspire]]. Their sweat glands may function abnormally or may not have developed at all because of inactive proteins in the sweat glands. Without normal sweat production, the body cannot regulate temperature properly. Therefore, overheating is a common problem, especially during hot weather. Access to cool environments is important.<ref>{{cite web| last = U.S. National Library of Medicine| title = Ectodermal dysplasia| encyclopedia = MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia| accessdate = 2 January 2013| url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001469.htm}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dental abnormalities in a 5-year-old girl from north Sweden family who suffered from various symptoms of autosomal dominant hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED).jpg|thumb|right|350px|Dental abnormalities in a 5-year-old girl from north Sweden family who suffered from various symptoms of autosomal dominant hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED):<br>\na) Intraoral view.

This is consistent with the salivary glands being of ectodermal origin, although some findings have suggested that there is also mesodermal input.<ref>Singh, P.; Warnakulasuriya, S.

The enamel may also be defective. Cosmetic dental treatment is almost always necessary and children may need dentures as early as two years of age. Multiple denture replacements are often needed as the child grows, and dental implants may be an option in adolescence, once the jaw is fully grown. Nowadays the option of extracting the teeth and substituting them with dental implants is quite common.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Borzabadi-Farahani |last2=A |title=Orthodontic considerations in restorative management of hypodontia patients with endosseous implants. |journal=Journal of Oral Implantology |volume=38|pages=779\u2013791 |date=December 2012 |issue=6 |pmid=21728818 |doi=10.1563/AAID-JOI-D-11-00022}}</ref> In other cases, teeth can be crowned.

In some types of ED, abnormal development of parts of the eye can result in dryness of the eye, cataracts, and vision defects. Professional eye care can help minimize the effects of ED on vision. Similarly, abnormalities in the development of the ear may cause hearing problems. Respiratory infections can be more common because the normal protective secretions of the mouth and nose are not present.
