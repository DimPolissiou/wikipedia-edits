He took diligent care to write case studies of his interactions with his patients and their ailments as well as his prescribed medicines.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite book|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History|last1=Furth|first1=Charlotte|date=March 1999|isbn=9780520208292}}</ref> Doctors such as Maoxian treated men as well as women, however Cheng described each case study with reference to contemporary social structures.\n\nIn encounters between sick women and their male doctors, women were often shy about their issues and frequently made the doctor's work more difficult by concealing the extent all symptoms. Even if they did confess all their symptoms, doctors, such as Cheng, would consider the majority of the illness to be linked to some problem concerning the woman's reproductive system or cycle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Congzhou|first1=Cheng}}</ref> One of the stories Cheng discussed in his case studies was that of Fan Jisuo's teenage daughter, who could not be diagnosed because she was unwilling to speak on her symptoms. In this particular case, the illness involved discharge from her intimate areas. Cheng insisted on asking more about her illness and the patient's modesty became a frustrating obstacle.\n\nWhen a woman fell ill, an appropriate adult man was to call the doctor and remain present during the examination, for the woman could not be left alone with the doctor. However, this was not always the case. In particular cases, when a woman dealt with complications of pregnancy or birth, older women became involved and assumed the role of the formal authority. Men in these situations would not have much power to interfere.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nHowever, when a doctor's visit was absolutely necessary, a breaking of norms was sometimes necessary. To properly examine the patient, doctors were faced with the task of going beyond the norm of female modesty. As Cheng describes, there were four standard methods of diagnosis\u2014looking, asking, listening and smelling and touching (for pulse-taking). To maintain some form of modesty, women would often stay hidden behind curtains and screens. The doctor was allowed to touch enough of her body to complete his examination, often just the pulse taking. This would lead to situations where the symptoms and the doctor's diagnosis did not agree and the doctor would have to ask to see more of the patient.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite book|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History: 960\u20131665|last1=Furth|first1=Charlotte|date=March 1999|isbn=9780520208292|page=248}}</ref>\n\n=== Yin Yang and Gender ===\nGender was presumed to influence the movement of energy and a well-trained physician would be expected to read the pulse and should have been able to identify two dozen or more energy flows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Canon of the Pulse (Maijing)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Yin and yang concepts were applied to the feminine and masculine aspects of all bodies at large, implying that in nature the differences between men and women begin at the level of this energy flow.

Second, women were often silent about their issues with doctors and male figures due to the societal expectation of female modesty and the presence of a male figure in the room.<ref name=\":03\" /> Third, the presence of male authority in the sick room and the patriarchal dominated society also caused doctors to reference their women and children patients \"the anonymous category of family members (''Jia Ren'') or household (''Ju Jia'')\"<ref name=\":03\" /> in their journals.

The term [[Caesarean section]] derives from an ancient Roman, or Caesarean (from Caesar) law that demanded that when a pregnant woman died, her body could not be buried until the unborn child had been removed. Ancient Roman doctors were forbidden from performing this procedure on living women, however.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/antiqua/gynecology/ |title = Ancient Gynecology}}</ref>\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine's attempts to grapple with pregnancy are documented from at least the seventeenth century. According to Charlotte Furth, \"a pregnancy (in the seventeenth century) as a known bodily experience emerged [...] out of the liminality of menstrual irregularity, as uneasy digestion, and a sense of fullness\".<ref name=\":03\" /> These symptoms were common among other illness as well, so the diagnosis of pregnancy often came later in the term. The ''Canon of the Pulse'' or the use of pulse in diagnosis stated that pregnancy was \"a condition marked by symptoms of disorder in one whose pulse is normal\" or \"where the pulse and symptoms do not agree\".<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Diagnosis for Pulse-Taking and Pulse Subtlety|date=March 2019|pages=69\u201377|publisher=WORLD SCIENTIFIC|isbn=9789813273573|doi=10.1142/9789813273580_0017|title=The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Medicine \u2013 Essential Questions}}</ref> Just as in the normal diagnosis process, women were often silent about suspected pregnancy, this led to many men in the households not knowing their wife or daughter was pregnant until complications arrived.\n\nComplications through the misdiagnosis and silence of pregnancies often involved medically induced abortions, according to Furth's book, Dr.Cheng (her case study) \"was unapologetic about endangering a fetus when pregnancy risked a mother's well being\".<ref name=\":03\" /> The method of abortion was used through the ingestion of certain herbs and medicinal foods.

According to Charlotte Furth and her book, ''A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China\u2019s Medical History'', yin and yang showed the embodiment of nature within human bodies, and with it the natural phenomena that we understand as gendered differences.<ref name=\":13\" /> Yin and yang ruled the body, the body being a microcosm of the universe and the earth. In addition, gender in the body was understood as homologous, the two genders operating in synchronization.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nOperating within yin and yang, bodily functions could be categorized through systems. In many drawings and diagrams, the twelve channels and their visceral systems were organized by yin and yang, and that organization was identical in female and male bodies. This points to the understanding in traditional Chinese medicine that female and male bodies were no different on the plane of yin and yang. Their gendered differences were not acknowledged in diagrams of the human body. Medical journals were filled with illustrations of male bodies or androgynous bodies, those that did not display gendered characteristics.<ref>Wu, Yi-Li, and {{lang|zh|\u5433\u4e00\u7acb}}. \"The Gendered Medical Iconography of the Golden Mirror, Yuzuan Yizong Jinjian {{lang|zh|\u5fa1\u7e82\u91ab\u5b97\u91d1\u9451}}, 1742.\" In ''Imagining Chinese Medicine'', edited by Lo Vivienne, {{lang|zh|\u7f85\u7dad\u524d}}, Barrett Penelope, Dear David, Di Lu, {{lang|zh|\u8606\u7b1b}}, Reynolds Lois, Yang Dolly, and {{lang|zh|\u694a\u5fb7\u79c0}}, 111\u201332.

As in other cultures, fertility and menstruation dominate female health in Chinese medicine. However, it was not physical, anatomical structures that differentiated women from men, but physiological and pathological processes of the body.<ref name=\":13\" /> This is an important distinction, because it refers back to the traditional Chinese understanding of Yin and Yang and gender differences. Bodies looked the same, and were governed by the same forces, but their processes looked different in men and women.\n\nFor example, understanding the womb and its fundamental difference from male bodies was irrelevant. Traditional Chinese medicine did not recognize the womb as the place of reproduction. For the Chinese, the abdominal cavity presented pathologies that were similar in both men and women, which included tumors, growths, hernias, and swellings of the genitals. The \"master system\" as Charlotte Furth identifies, is the Kidney visceral system, which governed reproductive functions in Traditional Chinese medicine.<ref name=\":13\" /> Therefore, it was not the anatomical structures in women that allowed for pregnancy, but the difference in female processes that allowed for the affliction of pregnancy to occur.\n\nSocial and cultural beliefs were often barriers to learning more about female health, with women themselves often being the most formidable barrier. Women were often uncomfortable talking about their illnesses, especially in front of the male chaperones that attended medical examinations.<ref name=\":13\" /> Women would choose to omit certain symptoms as a means of upholding their chastity and honor. One such examples is the case in which a teenage girl was unable to be diagnosed because she failed to mention her symptom of vaginal discharge.<ref name=\":13\" /> Silence was their way of maintaining control in these situations, but it often came at the expense of their health and the advancement of female health and medicine. This silence and control was most obviously seen when the health problem was related to the core of Ming ''fuke'', or the sexual body.<ref name=\":13\" /> It was often in these diagnostic settings that women would choose silence. In addition, there would be conflict between patient and doctor on the probability of her diagnosis. For example, a woman who thought herself to be past the point of child-bearing age, might not believe a doctor who diagnoses her as pregnant.<ref name=\":13\" /> This only resulted in more conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, female health and medicine was a topic that was not well understood by traditional Chinese medicine. Although ''yin'' and ''yang'' were central to understanding female bodies, it was often only through the lens of male bodies. Women were seen as variations of male bodies, with similar structures but different processes. This was also compounded by the autonomy of women who chose to stay silent during diagnostics, and thus complicate the issue of female health and medicine.\n\n==== Infertility ====\nInfertility was also not very well understood in traditional Chinese medicine, however it posed serious social and cultural repercussions.\n\nOne of the most cited scholar that mentions female health is 7th-century scholar Sun Simiao. He is often quoted to the likes of \"those who have prescriptions for women's distinctiveness take their differences of pregnancy, childbirth and [internal] bursting injuries as their basis.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Even in contemporary ''fu ke'' does Sun's observations about female reproductive functions, it stills remains an important function of women's health. The propensity to place more emphasis on reproductive functions, rather than the entire health of the woman, seems to suggest that the main function of ''fu ke'' is to produce children.\n\nOnce again, the Kidney visceral system governs the \"source ''Qi,''\" which governs the reproductive systems in both sexes. This source ''Qi'' was thought to \"be slowly depleted through sexual activity, menstruation and childbirth.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> It was also understood that the depletion of source Qi could result from the movement of an external pathology that moved through the outer visceral systems before causing more permanent damage to the home of source Qi, the Kidney system. In addition, the view that only very serious ailments ended in the damage of this system means that those who had trouble with their reproductive systems or fertility were seriously ill.\n\nAccording to traditional Chinese medical texts, infertility can be summarized into different syndrome types. These were spleen and kidney depletion (yang depletion), liver and kidney depletion (yin depletion), blood depletion, phlegm damp, liver oppression, and damp heat. This is important because, while most other issues were complex in Chinese medical physiology, women's fertility issues were simple. Most syndrome types revolved around menstruation, or lack thereof. The patient was entrusted with recording not only the frequency, but also the \"volume, color, consistency, and odor of menstrual flow.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> This placed responsibility of symptom recording on the patient, and was compounded by the earlier discussed issue of female chastity and honor. This meant that diagnosing female infertility was difficult, because the only symptoms that were recorded and monitored by the physician was the pulse and color of the tongue.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of infertility shows how social and cultural barriers affected the practice of traditional Chinese medicine.\n\n== Concept of disease ==\nIn general, disease is perceived as a disharmony (or imbalance) in the functions or interactions of yin, yang, qi, xu\u0115, z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4, meridians etc. and/or of the interaction between the human body and the environment.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Therapy is based on which \"pattern of disharmony\" can be identified.<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> Thus, \"pattern discrimination\" is the most important step in TCM diagnosis.<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> It is also known to be the most difficult aspect of practicing TCM.<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>\n\nTo determine which pattern is at hand, practitioners will examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing or the sound of the voice.<ref>\"Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine\", Giovanni Maciocia, Eastland Press; Revised edition (June 1995)</ref><ref name=Maciocia>{{Cite book|first=Giovanni|last=Maciocia|title=The Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=1989}}</ref> For example, depending on tongue and pulse conditions, a TCM practitioner might diagnose bleeding from the mouth and nose as: \"Liver fire rushes upwards and scorches the Lung, injuring the blood vessels and giving rise to reckless pouring of blood from the mouth and nose.\"<ref name=Deadman>Peter Deadman and Mazin Al-Khafaji.

for example: qi vacuity and qi stagnation in the case of qi;<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> blood vacuity, blood stasis, and blood heat in the case of xu\u0115;<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Spleen qi vacuity, Spleen yang vacuity, Spleen qi vacuity with down-bearing qi, Spleen qi vacuity with lack of blood containment, cold-damp invasion of the Spleen, damp-heat invasion of Spleen and Stomach in case of the Spleen z\u00e0ng;<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/> wind/cold/damp invasion in the case of the meridians.<ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/>\n\nTCM gives detailed prescriptions of these patterns regarding their typical symptoms, mostly including characteristic tongue and/or pulse findings.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> For example:\n* \"Upflaming Liver fire\" ({{zh|c=\u809d\u706b\u4e0a\u708e|labels=no|p=g\u0101nhu\u01d2 sh\u00e0ng y\u00e1n}}): Headache, red face, reddened eyes, dry mouth, nosebleeds, constipation, dry or hard stools, profuse menstruation, sudden [[tinnitus]] or deafness, vomiting of sour or bitter fluids, expectoration of blood, [[irascibility]], impatience; red tongue with dry yellow fur; slippery and string-like pulse.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n\n====Eight principles of diagnosis====\nThe process of determining which actual pattern is on hand is called {{lang|zh|\u8fa9\u8bc1}} ({{zh|labels=no|p=bi\u00e0n zh\u00e8ng}}, usually translated as \"pattern diagnosis\",<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/> \"pattern identification\"<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> or \"pattern discrimination\"<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>). Generally, the first and most important step in pattern diagnosis is an evaluation of the present signs and symptoms on the basis of the \"Eight Principles\" ({{zh|c=\u516b\u7eb2 |labels=no|p=b\u0101 g\u0101ng}}).<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\nThese eight principles refer to four pairs of fundamental qualities of a disease: exterior/interior, heat/cold, vacuity/repletion, and yin/yang.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Out of these, heat/cold and vacuity/repletion have the biggest clinical importance.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> The yin/yang quality, on the other side, has the smallest importance and is somewhat seen aside from the other three pairs, since it merely presents a general and vague conclusion regarding what other qualities are found.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> In detail, the Eight Principles refer to the following:\n* ''Yin and yang'' are universal aspects all things can be classified under, this includes diseases in general as well as the Eight Principles' first three couples.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> For example, cold is identified to be a yin aspect, while heat is attributed to yang.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Since descriptions of patterns in terms of yin and yang lack complexity and clinical practicality, though, patterns are usually not labelled this way anymore.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Exceptions are vacuity-cold and repletion-heat patterns, who are sometimes referred to as \"yin patterns\" and \"yang patterns\" respectively.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Exterior'' ({{zh|c=\u8868|labels=no|p=bi\u01ceo}}) refers to a disease manifesting in the superficial layers of the body \u2013 skin, hair, flesh, and meridians.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> It is characterized by aversion to cold and/or wind, headache, muscle ache, mild fever, a \"floating\" pulse, and a normal tongue appearance.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Interior'' ({{zh|c=\u91cc|labels=no|p=l\u01d0}}) refers to disease manifestation in the z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4, or (in a wider sense) to any disease that can not be counted as exterior.<ref name=\"Deng 1999\"/> There are no generalized characteristic symptoms of interior patterns, since they'll be determined by the affected z\u00e0ng or f\u01d4 entity.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Cold'' ({{zh|c=\u5bd2|labels=no|p=h\u00e1n}}) is generally characterized by aversion to cold, absence of thirst, and a white tongue fur.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> More detailed characterization depends on whether cold is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Heat'' ({{zh|c=\u70ed|labels=no|p=r\u00e8}}) is characterized by absence of aversion to cold, a red and painful throat, a dry tongue fur and a rapid and floating pulse, if it falls together with an exterior pattern.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> In all other cases, symptoms depend on whether heat is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Deficiency'' ({{zh|c=\u865a|labels=no|p=x\u016b}}), can be further differentiated into deficiency of [[#Qi|qi]], xu\u011b, [[#Yin and yang|yin and yang]], with all their respective characteristic symptoms.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Yin deficiency can also cause \"empty-heat\".<ref name=\"Kaptchuck 2000\"/>\n* ''Excess'' ({{zh|c=\u5b9e|labels=no|p=sh\u00ed}}) generally refers to any disease that can't be identified as a deficient pattern, and usually indicates the presence of one of the Six Excesses,<ref name=\"Deng 1999\"/> or a pattern of stagnation (of qi, xu\u011b, etc.).<ref>Tierra & Tierra 1998, p. 108</ref> In a concurrent exterior pattern, excess is characterized by the absence of sweating.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n\nAfter the fundamental nature of a disease in terms of the Eight Principles is determined, the investigation focuses on more specific aspects.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> By evaluating the present signs and symptoms against the background of typical disharmony patterns of the various entities, evidence is collected whether or how specific entities are affected.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> This evaluation can be done\n# in respect of the meridians ({{zh|c=\u7ecf\u7edc\u8fa9\u8bc1|labels=no|p=j\u012bnglu\u00f2 bi\u00e0n zh\u00e8ng}})<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>\n# in respect of qi ({{zh|c=\u6c14\u8840\u8fa9\u8bc1, |labels=no|p=q\u00ec xu\u00e8

Details of the tongue, including shape, size, color, texture, cracks, teethmarks, as well as tongue coating are all considered as part of [[tongue diagnosis]]. Various regions of the tongue's surface are believed to correspond to the z\u00e0ng-f\u016d organs. For example, redness on the tip of the tongue might indicate heat in the Heart, while redness on the sides of the tongue might indicate a heat in the Liver.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maciocia |first1=Giovanni |title=Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine |date=2001}}</ref>\n\nPulse palpation involves measuring the pulse both at a superficial and at a deep level at three different locations on the [[radial artery]] (''Cun, Guan, Chi'', located two fingerbreadths from the wrist crease, one fingerbreadth from the wrist crease, and right at the wrist crease, respectively, usually palpated with the index, middle and ring finger) of each arm, for a total of twelve pulses, all of which are thought to correspond with certain z\u00e0ng-f\u016d. The pulse is examined for several characteristics including rhythm, strength and volume, and described with qualities like \"floating, slippery, bolstering-like, feeble, thready and quick\"; each of these qualities indicate certain [[#Patterns|disease patterns]].

During the Cultural Revolution, the Ministry of Health directed health care throughout China and established primary care units. Chinese physicians who are trained in Western medicine also learn traditional medicine, while traditional healers receive training in modern methods, dynamically integrate modern medical concepts and methods, and revitalize some of the appropriate aspects of traditional medicine.

The medical staff combined the values of traditional China with modern methods to provide health and medical care to poor farmers in remote rural areas.

Chinese doctor Cheng Maoxian, born in 1581, lived and practiced medicine in Yangzhou in the 1610s and 1620s. He took diligent care to write case studies of his interactions with his patients and their ailments as well as his prescribed medicines.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite book|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History|last1=Furth|first1=Charlotte|date=March 1999|isbn=9780520208292}}</ref> Doctors such as Maoxian treated men as well as women, however Cheng described each case study with reference to contemporary social structures.\n\nIn encounters between sick women and their male doctors, women were often shy about their issues and frequently made the doctor's work more difficult by concealing the extent all symptoms. Even if they did confess all their symptoms, doctors, such as Cheng, would consider the majority of the illness to be linked to some problem concerning the woman's reproductive system or cycle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Congzhou|first1=Cheng}}</ref> One of the stories Cheng discussed in his case studies was that of Fan Jisuo's teenage daughter, who could not be diagnosed because she was unwilling to speak on her symptoms. In this particular case, the illness involved discharge from her intimate areas. Cheng insisted on asking more about her illness and the patient's modesty became a frustrating obstacle.\n\nWhen a woman fell ill, an appropriate adult man was to call the doctor and remain present during the examination, for the woman could not be left alone with the doctor. However, this was not always the case. In particular cases, when a woman dealt with complications of pregnancy or birth, older women became involved and assumed the role of the formal authority. Men in these situations would not have much power to interfere.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nHowever, when a doctor's visit was absolutely necessary, a breaking of norms was sometimes necessary. To properly examine the patient, doctors were faced with the task of going beyond the norm of female modesty. As Cheng describes, there were four standard methods of diagnosis\u2014looking, asking, listening and smelling and touching (for pulse-taking). To maintain some form of modesty, women would often stay hidden behind curtains and screens. The doctor was allowed to touch enough of her body to complete his examination, often just the pulse taking. This would lead to situations where the symptoms and the doctor's diagnosis did not agree and the doctor would have to ask to see more of the patient.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite book|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History: 960\u20131665|last1=Furth|first1=Charlotte|date=March 1999|isbn=9780520208292|page=248}}</ref>\n\n=== Yin Yang and Gender ===\nGender was presumed to influence the movement of energy and a well-trained physician would be expected to read the pulse and should have been able to identify two dozen or more energy flows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Canon of the Pulse (Maijing)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Yin and yang concepts were applied to the feminine and masculine aspects of all bodies at large, implying that in nature the differences between men and women begin at the level of this energy flow.

Second, women were often silent about their issues with doctors and male figures due to the societal expectation of female modesty and the presence of a male figure in the room.<ref name=\":03\" /> Third, the presence of male authority in the sick room and the patriarchal dominated society also caused doctors to reference their women and children patients \"the anonymous category of family members (''Jia Ren'') or household (''Ju Jia'')\"<ref name=\":03\" /> in their journals.

The term [[Caesarean section]] derives from an ancient Roman, or Caesarean (from Caesar) law that demanded that when a pregnant woman died, her body could not be buried until the unborn child had been removed. Ancient Roman doctors were forbidden from performing this procedure on living women, however.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/antiqua/gynecology/ |title = Ancient Gynecology}}</ref>\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine's attempts to grapple with pregnancy are documented from at least the seventeenth century. According to Charlotte Furth, \"a pregnancy (in the seventeenth century) as a known bodily experience emerged [...] out of the liminality of menstrual irregularity, as uneasy digestion, and a sense of fullness\".<ref name=\":03\" /> These symptoms were common among other illness as well, so the diagnosis of pregnancy often came later in the term.

According to Charlotte Furth and her book, ''A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China\u2019s Medical History'', yin and yang showed the embodiment of nature within human bodies, and with it the natural phenomena that we understand as gendered differences.<ref name=\":13\" /> Yin and yang ruled the body, the body being a microcosm of the universe and the earth. In addition, gender in the body was understood as homologous, the two genders operating in synchronization.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nOperating within yin and yang, bodily functions could be categorized through systems. In many drawings and diagrams, the twelve channels and their visceral systems were organized by yin and yang, and that organization was identical in female and male bodies. This points to the understanding in traditional Chinese medicine that female and male bodies were no different on the plane of yin and yang. Their gendered differences were not acknowledged in diagrams of the human body. Medical journals were filled with illustrations of male bodies or androgynous bodies, those that did not display gendered characteristics.<ref>Wu, Yi-Li, and {{lang|zh|\u5433\u4e00\u7acb}}. \"The Gendered Medical Iconography of the Golden Mirror, Yuzuan Yizong Jinjian {{lang|zh|\u5fa1\u7e82\u91ab\u5b97\u91d1\u9451}}, 1742.\" In ''Imagining Chinese Medicine'', edited by Lo Vivienne, {{lang|zh|\u7f85\u7dad\u524d}}, Barrett Penelope, Dear David, Di Lu, {{lang|zh|\u8606\u7b1b}}, Reynolds Lois, Yang Dolly, and {{lang|zh|\u694a\u5fb7\u79c0}}, 111\u201332.

As in other cultures, fertility and menstruation dominate female health in Chinese medicine. However, it was not physical, anatomical structures that differentiated women from men, but physiological and pathological processes of the body.<ref name=\":13\" /> This is an important distinction, because it refers back to the traditional Chinese understanding of Yin and Yang and gender differences. Bodies looked the same, and were governed by the same forces, but their processes looked different in men and women.\n\nFor example, understanding the womb and its fundamental difference from male bodies was irrelevant. Traditional Chinese medicine did not recognize the womb as the place of reproduction. For the Chinese, the abdominal cavity presented pathologies that were similar in both men and women, which included tumors, growths, hernias, and swellings of the genitals. The \"master system\" as Charlotte Furth identifies, is the Kidney visceral system, which governed reproductive functions in Traditional Chinese medicine.<ref name=\":13\" /> Therefore, it was not the anatomical structures in women that allowed for pregnancy, but the difference in female processes that allowed for the affliction of pregnancy to occur.\n\nSocial and cultural beliefs were often barriers to learning more about female health, with women themselves often being the most formidable barrier. Women were often uncomfortable talking about their illnesses, especially in front of the male chaperones that attended medical examinations.<ref name=\":13\" /> Women would choose to omit certain symptoms as a means of upholding their chastity and honor. One such examples is the case in which a teenage girl was unable to be diagnosed because she failed to mention her symptom of vaginal discharge.<ref name=\":13\" /> Silence was their way of maintaining control in these situations, but it often came at the expense of their health and the advancement of female health and medicine. This silence and control was most obviously seen when the health problem was related to the core of Ming ''fuke'', or the sexual body.<ref name=\":13\" /> It was often in these diagnostic settings that women would choose silence. In addition, there would be conflict between patient and doctor on the probability of her diagnosis. For example, a woman who thought herself to be past the point of child-bearing age, might not believe a doctor who diagnoses her as pregnant.<ref name=\":13\" /> This only resulted in more conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, female health and medicine was a topic that was not well understood by traditional Chinese medicine. Although ''yin'' and ''yang'' were central to understanding female bodies, it was often only through the lens of male bodies. Women were seen as variations of male bodies, with similar structures but different processes. This was also compounded by the autonomy of women who chose to stay silent during diagnostics, and thus complicate the issue of female health and medicine.\n\n==== Infertility ====\nInfertility was also not very well understood in traditional Chinese medicine, however it posed serious social and cultural repercussions.\n\nOne of the most cited scholar that mentions female health is 7th-century scholar Sun Simiao. He is often quoted to the likes of \"those who have prescriptions for women's distinctiveness take their differences of pregnancy, childbirth and [internal] bursting injuries as their basis.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Even in contemporary ''fu ke'' does Sun's observations about female reproductive functions, it stills remains an important function of women's health. The propensity to place more emphasis on reproductive functions, rather than the entire health of the woman, seems to suggest that the main function of ''fu ke'' is to produce children.\n\nOnce again, the Kidney visceral system governs the \"source ''Qi,''\" which governs the reproductive systems in both sexes. This source ''Qi'' was thought to \"be slowly depleted through sexual activity, menstruation and childbirth.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> It was also understood that the depletion of source Qi could result from the movement of an external pathology that moved through the outer visceral systems before causing more permanent damage to the home of source Qi, the Kidney system. In addition, the view that only very serious ailments ended in the damage of this system means that those who had trouble with their reproductive systems or fertility were seriously ill.\n\nAccording to traditional Chinese medical texts, infertility can be summarized into different syndrome types. These were spleen and kidney depletion (yang depletion), liver and kidney depletion (yin depletion), blood depletion, phlegm damp, liver oppression, and damp heat. This is important because, while most other issues were complex in Chinese medical physiology, women's fertility issues were simple. Most syndrome types revolved around menstruation, or lack thereof. The patient was entrusted with recording not only the frequency, but also the \"volume, color, consistency, and odor of menstrual flow.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> This placed responsibility of symptom recording on the patient, and was compounded by the earlier discussed issue of female chastity and honor. This meant that diagnosing female infertility was difficult, because the only symptoms that were recorded and monitored by the physician was the pulse and color of the tongue.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of infertility shows how social and cultural barriers affected the practice of traditional Chinese medicine.\n\n== Concept of disease ==\nIn general, disease is perceived as a disharmony (or imbalance) in the functions or interactions of yin, yang, qi, xu\u0115, z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4, meridians etc. and/or of the interaction between the human body and the environment.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Therapy is based on which \"pattern of disharmony\" can be identified.<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> Thus, \"pattern discrimination\" is the most important step in TCM diagnosis.<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> It is also known to be the most difficult aspect of practicing TCM.<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>\n\nTo determine which pattern is at hand, practitioners will examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing or the sound of the voice.<ref>\"Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine\", Giovanni Maciocia, Eastland Press; Revised edition (June 1995)</ref><ref name=Maciocia>{{Cite book|first=Giovanni|last=Maciocia|title=The Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=1989}}</ref> For example, depending on tongue and pulse conditions, a TCM practitioner might diagnose bleeding from the mouth and nose as: \"Liver fire rushes upwards and scorches the Lung, injuring the blood vessels and giving rise to reckless pouring of blood from the mouth and nose.\"<ref name=Deadman>Peter Deadman and Mazin Al-Khafaji.

for example: qi vacuity and qi stagnation in the case of qi;<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> blood vacuity, blood stasis, and blood heat in the case of xu\u0115;<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Spleen qi vacuity, Spleen yang vacuity, Spleen qi vacuity with down-bearing qi, Spleen qi vacuity with lack of blood containment, cold-damp invasion of the Spleen, damp-heat invasion of Spleen and Stomach in case of the Spleen z\u00e0ng;<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/> wind/cold/damp invasion in the case of the meridians.<ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/>\n\nTCM gives detailed prescriptions of these patterns regarding their typical symptoms, mostly including characteristic tongue and/or pulse findings.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> For example:\n* \"Upflaming Liver fire\" ({{zh|c=\u809d\u706b\u4e0a\u708e|labels=no|p=g\u0101nhu\u01d2 sh\u00e0ng y\u00e1n}}): Headache, red face, reddened eyes, dry mouth, nosebleeds, constipation, dry or hard stools, profuse menstruation, sudden [[tinnitus]] or deafness, vomiting of sour or bitter fluids, expectoration of blood, [[irascibility]], impatience; red tongue with dry yellow fur; slippery and string-like pulse.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n\n====Eight principles of diagnosis====\nThe process of determining which actual pattern is on hand is called {{lang|zh|\u8fa9\u8bc1}} ({{zh|labels=no|p=bi\u00e0n zh\u00e8ng}}, usually translated as \"pattern diagnosis\",<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/> \"pattern identification\"<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> or \"pattern discrimination\"<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>). Generally, the first and most important step in pattern diagnosis is an evaluation of the present signs and symptoms on the basis of the \"Eight Principles\" ({{zh|c=\u516b\u7eb2 |labels=no|p=b\u0101 g\u0101ng}}).<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\nThese eight principles refer to four pairs of fundamental qualities of a disease: exterior/interior, heat/cold, vacuity/repletion, and yin/yang.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Out of these, heat/cold and vacuity/repletion have the biggest clinical importance.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> The yin/yang quality, on the other side, has the smallest importance and is somewhat seen aside from the other three pairs, since it merely presents a general and vague conclusion regarding what other qualities are found.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> In detail, the Eight Principles refer to the following:\n* ''Yin and yang'' are universal aspects all things can be classified under, this includes diseases in general as well as the Eight Principles' first three couples.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> For example, cold is identified to be a yin aspect, while heat is attributed to yang.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Since descriptions of patterns in terms of yin and yang lack complexity and clinical practicality, though, patterns are usually not labelled this way anymore.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Exceptions are vacuity-cold and repletion-heat patterns, who are sometimes referred to as \"yin patterns\" and \"yang patterns\" respectively.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Exterior'' ({{zh|c=\u8868|labels=no|p=bi\u01ceo}}) refers to a disease manifesting in the superficial layers of the body \u2013 skin, hair, flesh, and meridians.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> It is characterized by aversion to cold and/or wind, headache, muscle ache, mild fever, a \"floating\" pulse, and a normal tongue appearance.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Interior'' ({{zh|c=\u91cc|labels=no|p=l\u01d0}}) refers to disease manifestation in the z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4, or (in a wider sense) to any disease that can not be counted as exterior.<ref name=\"Deng 1999\"/> There are no generalized characteristic symptoms of interior patterns, since they'll be determined by the affected z\u00e0ng or f\u01d4 entity.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Cold'' ({{zh|c=\u5bd2|labels=no|p=h\u00e1n}}) is generally characterized by aversion to cold, absence of thirst, and a white tongue fur.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> More detailed characterization depends on whether cold is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Heat'' ({{zh|c=\u70ed|labels=no|p=r\u00e8}}) is characterized by absence of aversion to cold, a red and painful throat, a dry tongue fur and a rapid and floating pulse, if it falls together with an exterior pattern.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> In all other cases, symptoms depend on whether heat is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Deficiency'' ({{zh|c=\u865a|labels=no|p=x\u016b}}), can be further differentiated into deficiency of [[#Qi|qi]], xu\u011b, [[#Yin and yang|yin and yang]], with all their respective characteristic symptoms.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Yin deficiency can also cause \"empty-heat\".<ref name=\"Kaptchuck 2000\"/>\n* ''Excess'' ({{zh|c=\u5b9e|labels=no|p=sh\u00ed}}) generally refers to any disease that can't be identified as a deficient pattern, and usually indicates the presence of one of the Six Excesses,<ref name=\"Deng 1999\"/> or a pattern of stagnation (of qi, xu\u011b, etc.).<ref>Tierra & Tierra 1998, p. 108</ref> In a concurrent exterior pattern, excess is characterized by the absence of sweating.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n\nAfter the fundamental nature of a disease in terms of the Eight Principles is determined, the investigation focuses on more specific aspects.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> By evaluating the present signs and symptoms against the background of typical disharmony patterns of the various entities, evidence is collected whether or how specific entities are affected.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> This evaluation can be done\n# in respect of the meridians ({{zh|c=\u7ecf\u7edc\u8fa9\u8bc1|labels=no|p=j\u012bnglu\u00f2 bi\u00e0n zh\u00e8ng}})<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>\n# in respect of qi ({{zh|c=\u6c14\u8840\u8fa9\u8bc1, |labels=no|p=q\u00ec xu\u00e8

Details of the tongue, including shape, size, color, texture, cracks, teethmarks, as well as tongue coating are all considered as part of [[tongue diagnosis]]. Various regions of the tongue's surface are believed to correspond to the z\u00e0ng-f\u016d organs. For example, redness on the tip of the tongue might indicate heat in the Heart, while redness on the sides of the tongue might indicate a heat in the Liver.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maciocia |first1=Giovanni |title=Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine |date=2001}}</ref>\n\nPulse palpation involves measuring the pulse both at a superficial and at a deep level at three different locations on the [[radial artery]] (''Cun, Guan, Chi'', located two fingerbreadths from the wrist crease, one fingerbreadth from the wrist crease, and right at the wrist crease, respectively, usually palpated with the index, middle and ring finger) of each arm, for a total of twelve pulses, all of which are thought to correspond with certain z\u00e0ng-f\u016d.

Models are featured in a variety of media formats including: books, magazines, films, newspapers, [[Internet modelling|internet]] and television.

Eventually, this became common practice for [[French fashion#Final 19th, the Belle \u00e9poque and early 20th century|Parisian fashion houses]]. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their [[Fashion design|designs]].\n\nWith the development of [[fashion photography]], the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world's first three supermodels, [[Barbara Goalen]], [[Bettina Graziani]] and [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' covers; her name recognition led to the importance of ''Vogue'' in shaping the careers of fashion models.

Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so referred to themselves as secretaries. With the exception of a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labor laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and [[fashion magazines]] but was in dire need of models. Italian agencies would often coerce models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708041838/http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|url=http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|archive-date=8 July 2008|date=January 2007|title=A Brief History Of Modelling|author=Peter Marlowe|website=The Peter Marlowe Model Composite Archives}}</ref> They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from [[customs]] agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in [[Paris]] or the Arena in [[Milan]] to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the [[Marilyn Agency]] has branches in Paris and New York.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy the late 1960s, [[London]] was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names. Models such as [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Tania Mallet]], [[Celia Hammond]], [[Twiggy]], [[Penelope Tree]], and dominated the London fashion scene and were well paid, unlike their predecessors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |title=David Bailey's favourite model Jean Shrimpton was the Shrimp who sparked the Sixties \u2013 Telegraph |publisher=Fashion.telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-19 |location=London |first=Lisa |last=Armstrong |date=2012-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827035540/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |archive-date=2012-08-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> Twiggy became The Face of '66 at the age of 16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030211153058/http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-02-11 |title=Twiggy \u2013 The Official Site |publisher=Twiggylawson.co.uk |date=1966-02-23 |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> At this time, model agencies were not as restrictive about the models they represented, although it was uncommon for them to sign shorter models.

The formation of this association helped legitimize modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot. Meanwhile, agencies took responsibility for a model's promotional materials and branding. That same year, former top fashion model [[Wilhelmina Cooper]] opened up her own fashion agency with her husband called [[Wilhelmina Models]].

The mid\u20111990s also saw many Asian countries establishing modelling agencies.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the heroin chic era had run its course. Teen-inspired clothing infiltrated mainstream fashion, teen [[pop music]] was on the rise, and artists such as [[Britney Spears]], [[Aaliyah]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] popularized [[Artificial leather|pleather]] and bare midriffs. As fashion changed to a more youthful [[Demography|demographic]], the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following [[Gisele Bundchen]]'s breakthrough, a wave of [[Brazil]]ian models including [[Adriana Lima]] and [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s. Some have tied this increase in Brazilian models to the trend of magazines featuring celebrities instead of models on their covers.<ref name=\"um\">''Death of the Supermodels'' by C. L.

Plus-size models are also engaged in work that is not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, e.g., [[stock photography]] and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products and sunglasses, footwear and watches. Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines.

[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]] in October 1969, covered their issue with [[Naomi Sims|Noami Sims]], one of the most influential black models in the industry. Her rise to fame lead her to international magazine jobs and individual projects with designers across the globe.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/news/naomi-campbell-famous-black-models|title=Naomi Campbell and 10 Black Models Who Owned the Runway|last=Haynes|first=Clarence|date=June 24, 2019|website=Biography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 11, 2019}}</ref> In the Life Magazine issue, Black Beauty, a new agency that represented black models, had a spread in the magazine that showcased 39 black models. Each one of the models had their own unique features, allowing black expression to progress through this historic magazine spread.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the movement's presence both in magazines and the runway, designers began to realize the need to include black models on their runways and advertisements. The battle of Versallies was one of the most notable moments in fashion history that put black models on the map. [[Eleanor Lambert]], creator of Fashion Week and a major \u201c[controller] of the narrative of American fashion\u201d, set up a dinner and a fundraiser to both increase American fashion visibility and restore the palace of Versailles.<ref name=\":1\" /> Five French designers and five American designers battled it out on the runway, showing off the fashion, and for the Americans, black models as well. [[Oscar de la Renta]] stated \u201cit was the black models that had made the difference.\u201d [[Pat Cleveland]], [[Bethann Hardison|Bethann Hardiason]], [[Billie Blair]], Jennifer Brice, Alva Chinn, and [[The Battle of Versailles Fashion Show|Ramona Saunders,]] were among the many black models that helped Team America win and stun the French competition. This competition made the black model a worldwide phenomenon. The French were beginning to welcome diversity on the runway and in their advertising. With the recognition Versaillies had given, black presence in the modeling world carried out into the 1980s and the 1990s. The models were now known by name and the publicity that came with the designers they were modeling for. With the rise of the \u201csupermodel\u201d, models like [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]] and [[Tyra Banks]] paved the way for black success.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]], born in London, was the first black model to cover [[Vogue (magazine)|American Vogue]], [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]], Russian Vogue, and the first British black model to cover British vogue. She, till this day, is one of the most iconic and distinguished models to work in the industry. Brands like [[Chanel]], [[Louis Vuitton|Louis Vitton]], [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Prada]], and more have all featured Campbell in their campaigns. She used her remarkable success to achieve more than fashion excelience.\n[[File:Tyra Banks 1995.jpg|thumb|Tyra Banks (1995)]]\nBy the mid-1990s, black presence in the modeling world had dramatically decreased. Designers began to favor a consistent aesthetic and elected for skinner white models. This reality was paved by models like [[Kate Moss]] and [[Stella Tennant]] who provided a more consistent look for the runway. At this time, \u201cthe number of working black models in high-profile runway presentation...became so dire that stories began appearing in the mainstream media about the whitewashing of the runway\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/09/givhan-confronting-the-lack-of-black-models.html|title=Robin Givhan: Confronting the Lack of Black Models on the Runway|last=Givhan|first=Robin|date=September 6, 2013|website=The Cut|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> In response, models like Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison, joined forces throughout the \u201cDiversity Coalition\u201d in an attempt to \u201ccall out and accuse prominent fashion houses for snubbing Black and Asian models on the catwalk, editorial spreads, and campaigns\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> The lack of representation was, in part, due to the belief that \u201cblack girls don\u2019t push products,\u201d which \u201cencouraged people who work directly and indirectly in the industry to speak out on the injustices that go on within it\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the 1990s, it was quite clear that the top designers simply preferred a new aesthetic that excluded models of color, which resulted in only 6% of runway models to be women of color.<ref name=\":1\" /> Campbell's Diversity Coalition's main mission was to \u201cexpedite inclusion on the runway by deliberately calling out designers who have executed acts of racism on the runway\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Campbell, it was their choice to not include black models on the runway and desire a uniformed runway that resulted in a racist act. Although such a dramatic effort to exclude black presence from the fashion world, models like [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Veronica Webb]] persisted. Banks not only dominated the runway as a teen, she took over countless pop culture platforms. Being the first black model to cover [[Sports Illustrated]], Banks was one of the most prominent models in the early 2000s. Covering [[Sports Illustrated]], Elle, [[Essence (magazine)|Essence]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], and walking for [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior (fashion house)|Chrisitan Dior]], and Claude Motnanta, Banks was truly dominating the fashion world. In addition, she acted in ''French Prince of Bel Air'' and created her own reality competition show called [[America's Next Top Model]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In conversation with Trebay of Los the New York Times, Banks stated that her first cover on Sport Illustrated \u201cchanged [her] life overnight.. You have to think back to remember what that did for an appreciation of black beauty to have a black girl, a girl next door type, on the cover of one of the most mass mainstream magazines of our lives.

Glamour models can be any size or shape. There is no industry standard for glamour modelling and it varies greatly by country. For the most part, glamour models are limited to modelling in [[calendar]]s, [[men's magazine]]s, such as ''[[Playboy]]'', [[bikini]] modelling, [[lingerie]] modelling, fetish modelling, music videos, and extra work in films. However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in [[swimwear]], [[bikini]] and [[lingerie]] campaigns.\n\nIt is widely considered{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that England created the market for glamour modelling when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' established [[Page Three|Page 3]] in 1969,<ref name=\"bbc3651850\">{{cite news |last=Braid |first=Mary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Page Three girls \u2013 the naked truth |work=BBC News |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904054436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of ''Penthouse'' and ''Playboy'' models. From 1970 models appeared topless. In the 1980s, ''The Sun''{{'s}} competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections.<ref name=\"bbc3651850\"/> It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of [[Samantha Fox]]. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and has numerous glamour modelling agencies to this day.\n\nIt was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as [[Victoria Silvstedt]] left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |title=Biography |publisher=Victoriasilvstedt.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918175550/http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |archive-date=2012-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the previous decades, posing nude for ''Playboy''  resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey |title=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey: Bebe Buell, Victor Bockris: 9780312266943: Amazon.com: Books |df= |isbn=0312266944 |date=2001-08-13 |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelheart00bebe }}</ref> ''Playboy'' was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, [[Pamela Anderson]], and [[Anna Nicole Smith]]. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her ''Playboy'' spreads that she was able to land roles on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'', and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's ''[[Slitz]]'' re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gente |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |title='Intervi\u00fa' desnuda a Nereida Gallardo, la novia de Cristiano Ronaldo |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221153140/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |archive-date=2011-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as [[Katie Price]], became household names.

Petite models typically work more often in commercial, and print modeling (rather than runway modeling)\n\nThe height of models is typically above {{convert|5|ft|9|in}} for women, and above {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} for men. Models who are of heights such as {{convert|5|ft|5|in}} fall under the category of petite models.\n\nPetite models typically model shoes because their feet are of more common sizes compared to the average fashion model.\n\n===Fitness models===\n{{See also|Fitness and figure competition}}\n[[File:Fitness Model Britt 2007.JPG|thumb|upright|Fitness model posing with [[dumbbell]]]]\nFitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in [[fitness and figure competition]]s. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that gear towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.\n\n===Gravure idols===\n\n{{see also|List of Japanese gravure idols}}\n\nIn Japan, a {{nihongo4|gravure idol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb|gurabia aidoru}}, often abbreviated to {{nihongo4|gradol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30c9\u30eb|guradoru}}, is a female model who primarily models for magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. {{nihongo4|\"Gurabia\"|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2}} is a [[Wasei-eigo]] term derived from \"[[rotogravure]]\", which is a type of [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printing]] process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features.

The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she is representing.  This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional [[advertising media]] (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.\n\n[[Marketing campaign]]s that make use of promotional models may take place in [[Retailing|stores]] or [[shopping mall]]s, at [[tradeshow]]s, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.\n\n====Spokesmodels====\n{{main|Spokesmodel}}\n\"Spokesmodel\" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific [[brand]] in [[advertisement]]s. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel are the models hired to be the [[Marlboro Man]] between 1954 and 1999.\n\n====Trade show models====\n[[Trade show]] models work a trade show floorspace or booth, and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are [[freelancer]]s hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from the hundreds of other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.\n\n====Atmosphere models====\n[[File:Atmosphere Models 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Atmosphere models at a sexy costume party]]\n'''Atmosphere models''' are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the theme of the event and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a \"Brazilian Day\" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.\n\n====Podium models====\n[[File:Podium Model 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Podium model modeling a dress by [[Sue Wong]]]]\n'''Podium models''' differ from runway models in that they don't walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They are kind of like live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing.  Podium Modeling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.\n\n===Art models===\n{{Main|Model (art)}}\n[[File:2009-08-31-akt-muehle-099.jpg|thumb|left|Art school model]]\n'''Art models''' pose for any [[visual artist]] as part of the [[creative process]]. Art models are often paid [[professionals]] who provide a reference or inspiration for a [[work of art]] that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are [[figure drawing]], [[figure painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]], but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the expense of a model.\n\n===Instagram models===\n'''Instagram models''' have become popular due to the widespread use of [[social media]]. They are models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on [[Instagram]] and other social media. They should not be confused with established models such as [[Cara Delevingne]] and [[Gigi Hadid]], who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers,<ref name=ABC/> although some models, such as [[Playboy]] model [[Lindsey Pelas]], begin their modelling careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as [[Rosie Roff]] who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a [[ring girl]] in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram provides unsigned models with a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts.<ref name=Saul>{{cite newspaper|title=Instafamous: Meet the social media influencers redefining celebrity|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|date=27 March 2016|author=Heather Saul|newspaper=Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901063025/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|archive-date=2017-09-01|url-status=live}}</ref> American model [[Matthew Noszka]] entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by [[Wilhelmina Models]].<ref name=ABC>{{cite news|title=From Construction to High Fashion: How Instagram Helped This Male Model Get Discovered|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|date=26 February 2015|author1=Mara Schiavocampo|author2=Claire Pedersen|author3=Timor Balaish|author4=Lauren Effron|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052246/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as [[Rumi Neely]] and [[Chiara Ferragni]] began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits.<ref name=Spinks>{{cite web|title=What It's Actually Like to Be an Instagram Model|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/what-instagram-models-actually-do|work=Vice|author=Rosie Spinks|date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in [[influencer marketing]],<ref name=Saul/> promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas.<ref name=Spinks/> High-profile influencers are able to earn thousands of US dollars for promoting commercial brands.

Models are featured in a variety of media formats including: books, magazines, films, newspapers, [[Internet modelling|internet]] and television.

Eventually, this became common practice for [[French fashion#Final 19th, the Belle \u00e9poque and early 20th century|Parisian fashion houses]]. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their [[Fashion design|designs]].\n\nWith the development of [[fashion photography]], the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world's first three supermodels, [[Barbara Goalen]], [[Bettina Graziani]] and [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' covers; her name recognition led to the importance of ''Vogue'' in shaping the careers of fashion models.

Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so referred to themselves as secretaries. With the exception of a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labor laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and [[fashion magazines]] but was in dire need of models. Italian agencies would often coerce models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708041838/http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|url=http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|archive-date=8 July 2008|date=January 2007|title=A Brief History Of Modelling|author=Peter Marlowe|website=The Peter Marlowe Model Composite Archives}}</ref> They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from [[customs]] agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in [[Paris]] or the Arena in [[Milan]] to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the [[Marilyn Agency]] has branches in Paris and New York.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy the late 1960s, [[London]] was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names.

The formation of this association helped legitimize modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot. Meanwhile, agencies took responsibility for a model's promotional materials and branding. That same year, former top fashion model [[Wilhelmina Cooper]] opened up her own fashion agency with her husband called [[Wilhelmina Models]].

[[Kate Moss]] became its poster child through her ads for [[Calvin Klein]]. In spite of the heroin chic movement, model [[Claudia Schiffer]] earned $12&nbsp;million. With the popularity of lingerie retailer [[Victoria's Secret]], and the ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'', there was a need for healthier-looking{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} supermodels such as [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Heidi Klum]] to meet commercial modelling demand. The mid\u20111990s also saw many Asian countries establishing modelling agencies.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the heroin chic era had run its course. Teen-inspired clothing infiltrated mainstream fashion, teen [[pop music]] was on the rise, and artists such as [[Britney Spears]], [[Aaliyah]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] popularized [[Artificial leather|pleather]] and bare midriffs. As fashion changed to a more youthful [[Demography|demographic]], the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following [[Gisele Bundchen]]'s breakthrough, a wave of [[Brazil]]ian models including [[Adriana Lima]] and [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s.

Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines.

It began most notably from the need of advertisers and a rise of African American photography magazines. The women who advanced in such careers were those in a middle-class system that emphasized the conservative value of marriage, motherhood, and domesticity. Originally titled the \u201cBrownskin\u201d model, African American women refined the social, sexual, and racial realities confined in the gender expectations of the modeling world.

Known as the \u201cBlack is Beautiful\u201d movement, the 1970s became the era of the black model.

The battle of Versallies was one of the most notable moments in fashion history that put black models on the map. [[Eleanor Lambert]], creator of Fashion Week and a major \u201c[controller] of the narrative of American fashion\u201d, set up a dinner and a fundraiser to both increase American fashion visibility and restore the palace of Versailles.<ref name=\":1\" /> Five French designers and five American designers battled it out on the runway, showing off the fashion, and for the Americans, black models as well. [[Oscar de la Renta]] stated \u201cit was the black models that had made the difference.\u201d [[Pat Cleveland]], [[Bethann Hardison|Bethann Hardiason]], [[Billie Blair]], Jennifer Brice, Alva Chinn, and [[The Battle of Versailles Fashion Show|Ramona Saunders,]] were among the many black models that helped Team America win and stun the French competition. This competition made the black model a worldwide phenomenon. The French were beginning to welcome diversity on the runway and in their advertising. With the recognition Versaillies had given, black presence in the modeling world carried out into the 1980s and the 1990s. The models were now known by name and the publicity that came with the designers they were modeling for. With the rise of the \u201csupermodel\u201d, models like [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]] and [[Tyra Banks]] paved the way for black success.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]], born in London, was the first black model to cover [[Vogue (magazine)|American Vogue]], [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]], Russian Vogue, and the first British black model to cover British vogue.

Brands like [[Chanel]], [[Louis Vuitton|Louis Vitton]], [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Prada]], and more have all featured Campbell in their campaigns. She used her remarkable success to achieve more than fashion excelience.\n[[File:Tyra Banks 1995.jpg|thumb|Tyra Banks (1995)]]\nBy the mid-1990s, black presence in the modeling world had dramatically decreased. Designers began to favor a consistent aesthetic and elected for skinner white models. This reality was paved by models like [[Kate Moss]] and [[Stella Tennant]] who provided a more consistent look for the runway.

Although such a dramatic effort to exclude black presence from the fashion world, models like [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Veronica Webb]] persisted. Banks not only dominated the runway as a teen, she took over countless pop culture platforms. Being the first black model to cover [[Sports Illustrated]], Banks was one of the most prominent models in the early 2000s. Covering [[Sports Illustrated]], Elle, [[Essence (magazine)|Essence]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], and walking for [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior (fashion house)|Chrisitan Dior]], and Claude Motnanta, Banks was truly dominating the fashion world.

However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in [[swimwear]], [[bikini]] and [[lingerie]] campaigns.\n\nIt is widely considered{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that England created the market for glamour modelling when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' established [[Page Three|Page 3]] in 1969,<ref name=\"bbc3651850\">{{cite news |last=Braid |first=Mary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Page Three girls \u2013 the naked truth |work=BBC News |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904054436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of ''Penthouse'' and ''Playboy'' models. From 1970 models appeared topless. In the 1980s, ''The Sun''{{'s}} competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections.<ref name=\"bbc3651850\"/> It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of [[Samantha Fox]]. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and has numerous glamour modelling agencies to this day.\n\nIt was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as [[Victoria Silvstedt]] left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |title=Biography |publisher=Victoriasilvstedt.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918175550/http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |archive-date=2012-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the previous decades, posing nude for ''Playboy''  resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey |title=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey: Bebe Buell, Victor Bockris: 9780312266943: Amazon.com: Books |df= |isbn=0312266944 |date=2001-08-13 |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelheart00bebe }}</ref> ''Playboy'' was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, [[Pamela Anderson]], and [[Anna Nicole Smith]]. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her ''Playboy'' spreads that she was able to land roles on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'', and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's ''[[Slitz]]'' re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gente |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |title='Intervi\u00fa' desnuda a Nereida Gallardo, la novia de Cristiano Ronaldo |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221153140/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |archive-date=2011-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as [[Katie Price]], became household names.

Petite models typically work more often in commercial, and print modeling (rather than runway modeling)\n\nThe height of models is typically above {{convert|5|ft|9|in}} for women, and above {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} for men. Models who are of heights such as {{convert|5|ft|5|in}} fall under the category of petite models.\n\nPetite models typically model shoes because their feet are of more common sizes compared to the average fashion model.\n\n===Fitness models===\n{{See also|Fitness and figure competition}}\n[[File:Fitness Model Britt 2007.JPG|thumb|upright|Fitness model posing with [[dumbbell]]]]\nFitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in [[fitness and figure competition]]s. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that gear towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.\n\n===Gravure idols===\n\n{{see also|List of Japanese gravure idols}}\n\nIn Japan, a {{nihongo4|gravure idol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb|gurabia aidoru}}, often abbreviated to {{nihongo4|gradol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30c9\u30eb|guradoru}}, is a female model who primarily models for magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. {{nihongo4|\"Gurabia\"|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2}} is a [[Wasei-eigo]] term derived from \"[[rotogravure]]\", which is a type of [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printing]] process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features. The rotogravure process is still used for commercial printing of magazines, [[postcard]]s, and [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] product packaging.<ref name=\"kelana\">{{cite news|last1=Jimi Okelana|title=Japan 101: Guide to Gravure Idols|url=http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=Axiom Magazine|date=March 10, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728194637/http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|archivedate=28 July 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\t \nGravure idols appear in a wide range of photographic styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure idols may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude. Gravure idols may be as young as pre-teen age up to their early thirties. In addition to appearing in mainstream magazines, gravure idols often release their own professional photobooks and DVDs for their fans. Many popular [[Japanese idol|female idols in Japan]] launched their careers by starting out as gravure idols.<ref name=\"kelana\"/><ref name=\"Springer\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Galbraith |editor1-first=P.

Commercial print models can earn up to $250 an hour. Commercial print models are usually non-exclusive, and primarily work in one location.\n\nThere are several large fashion agencies that have commercial print divisions, including Ford Models in the United States.\n\n===Promotional models===\n{{Main|Promotional model}}\n[[File:IZIBA2004 056 (1924606).jpg|thumb|Two models with the logo of [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]], a cigarette brand they are promoting, printed on the backside of their shorts in [[Ibiza]], 2004]]\nA promotional model is a model hired to drive [[consumer demand]] for a product, service, brand, or concept by directly interacting with potential consumers. The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she is representing.  This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional [[advertising media]] (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.\n\n[[Marketing campaign]]s that make use of promotional models may take place in [[Retailing|stores]] or [[shopping mall]]s, at [[tradeshow]]s, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.\n\n====Spokesmodels====\n{{main|Spokesmodel}}\n\"Spokesmodel\" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific [[brand]] in [[advertisement]]s. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel are the models hired to be the [[Marlboro Man]] between 1954 and 1999.\n\n====Trade show models====\n[[Trade show]] models work a trade show floorspace or booth, and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are [[freelancer]]s hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from the hundreds of other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.\n\n====Atmosphere models====\n[[File:Atmosphere Models 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Atmosphere models at a sexy costume party]]\n'''Atmosphere models''' are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the theme of the event and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a \"Brazilian Day\" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.\n\n====Podium models====\n[[File:Podium Model 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Podium model modeling a dress by [[Sue Wong]]]]\n'''Podium models''' differ from runway models in that they don't walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They are kind of like live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing.  Podium Modeling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.\n\n===Art models===\n{{Main|Model (art)}}\n[[File:2009-08-31-akt-muehle-099.jpg|thumb|left|Art school model]]\n'''Art models''' pose for any [[visual artist]] as part of the [[creative process]]. Art models are often paid [[professionals]] who provide a reference or inspiration for a [[work of art]] that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are [[figure drawing]], [[figure painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]], but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the expense of a model.\n\n===Instagram models===\n'''Instagram models''' have become popular due to the widespread use of [[social media]]. They are models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on [[Instagram]] and other social media. They should not be confused with established models such as [[Cara Delevingne]] and [[Gigi Hadid]], who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers,<ref name=ABC/> although some models, such as [[Playboy]] model [[Lindsey Pelas]], begin their modelling careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as [[Rosie Roff]] who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a [[ring girl]] in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram provides unsigned models with a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts.<ref name=Saul>{{cite newspaper|title=Instafamous: Meet the social media influencers redefining celebrity|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|date=27 March 2016|author=Heather Saul|newspaper=Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901063025/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|archive-date=2017-09-01|url-status=live}}</ref> American model [[Matthew Noszka]] entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by [[Wilhelmina Models]].<ref name=ABC>{{cite news|title=From Construction to High Fashion: How Instagram Helped This Male Model Get Discovered|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|date=26 February 2015|author1=Mara Schiavocampo|author2=Claire Pedersen|author3=Timor Balaish|author4=Lauren Effron|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052246/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as [[Rumi Neely]] and [[Chiara Ferragni]] began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits.<ref name=Spinks>{{cite web|title=What It's Actually Like to Be an Instagram Model|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/what-instagram-models-actually-do|work=Vice|author=Rosie Spinks|date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in [[influencer marketing]],<ref name=Saul/> promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas.<ref name=Spinks/> High-profile influencers are able to earn thousands of US dollars for promoting commercial brands.
