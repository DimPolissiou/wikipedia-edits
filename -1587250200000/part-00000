Canisters are sometimes picked up and lobbed back at police or extinguished straight away with water, or neutralised using objects such as traffic cones.

Production began in 2010, with the casting of the four members of The Sapphires and filming taking place in and around [[Albury]] in [[Australia]] and [[Vietnam]] during August and September 2011.\n\n''The Sapphires'' made its [[Film premiere|world premiere]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]] on 19 May 2012 during its out-of-competition screenings, was theatrically released in Australia on 9 August and received a limited release in the United States on 22 March 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1968 Australia, Gail and Cynthia head into town to sing country & western songs for a talent contest but their young sister, Julie, is forbidden from going because she has a child and is too young until she bribes a fellow neighbour to take her into town. An alcoholic, Irish compere, Dave Lovelace, is scolded by his boss for being late despite him sleeping in his car that is near work. Despite being the best act in the contest, the girls not only do not win, but are told to leave. Dave recognizes their talent and learns from Julie that the troops need singers for Vietnam. Soon, Dave goes to make a call and he says they have been granted a spot to audition in Melbourne. Back at their place, Gail, Cynthia and Julie's mother tells him he can take them but without Julie, until Julie's father tells him not to worry about her. Advised by their grandmother, they meet up with their cousin Kay, who had been living in Melbourne for 10 years after the government took her from her family during the stolen generations, because she was half white. She rejects the offer of joining them, but later changes her mind and meets up at their uncle's place. After days of practising their moves, they are almost ready until Julie gives Cynthia a letter from her fianc\u00e9 that he is going to call it off. Despite that, they manage to audition very well and Kay comes up with the group's name, The Sapphires, after looking at Cynthia's engagement ring.\n\nThe Sapphires are a success with the crowds, but infighting among the women threatens to tear the group apart: Gail acts as the group's aggressive matriarch. Kay struggles with her multi-ethnic identity because 10 years earlier she was taken away from the family by the Government, along with thousands of other fairer-skinned Aboriginal children and sent to live in institutions where they were to be raised 'white'. Julie proves to be the group's best voice with a shot at a singing career. Dave and Gail begin a romance, but his reckless behaviour and a personal secret push Gail's patience to the limit.\n\nWhen The Sapphires do another gig, Cynthia drinks with some of the men and is not allowed to go on again. Later, Dave and Gail talk a little before Dave hands her a letter, telling her to open it later and are about to kiss when they are caught in the crossfire of war; Dave disappears in the chaos and gets shot. The girls manage to escape in a helicopter. At home, Gail reads Dave's letter and realizes he wanted to propose to her, but it was her choice. The women band together and finish their tour. Dave survives and Gail is reunited with him in a Vietnam hospital. The Sapphires return to Australia and Gail and Dave announce to the family that they plan to marry. The Sapphires give a joyous performance for their friends and family in the yard of their home.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris O'Dowd]] as Dave Lovelace\n* [[Deborah Mailman]] as Gail\n** Tanika Lonesborough as Young Gail\n* [[Jessica Mauboy]] as Julie\n** Miah Madden as Young Julie\n* [[Shari Sebbens]] as Kay\n** Nioka Brennan as Young Kay\n* [[Miranda Tapsell]] as Cynthia\n** Ava Jean Miller-Porter as Young Cynthia\n* Don Battee as Myron\n* [[Tory Kittles]] as Robby\n* [[Eka Darville]] as Hendo\n* [[Kylie Belling]] as Geraldine\n* [[Judith Lucy]] as Merle\n* [[Georgina Haig]] as Glynis\n* [[Rhys Muldoon]] as Uncle Ed\n* [[Barry Southgate]] and A.

Archived from [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/11/12/1100227566726.html the original] on 22 March 2013.</ref> The film is directed by [[Wayne Blair]] and written by Keith Thompson and [[Tony Briggs]], the latter of whom wrote the play.\n\n''The Sapphires'' is about four [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] women, Gail ([[Deborah Mailman]]), Julie ([[Jessica Mauboy]]), Kay ([[Shari Sebbens]]) and Cynthia ([[Miranda Tapsell]]), who are discovered by a talent scout ([[Chris O'Dowd]]), and form a music group named The Sapphires, travelling to [[Vietnam]] in 1968 to sing for troops during the [[1968 in the Vietnam War|war]]. Production began in 2010, with the casting of the four members of The Sapphires and filming taking place in and around [[Albury]] in [[Australia]] and [[Vietnam]] during August and September 2011.\n\n''The Sapphires'' made its [[Film premiere|world premiere]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]] on 19 May 2012 during its out-of-competition screenings, was theatrically released in Australia on 9 August and received a limited release in the United States on 22 March 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1968 Australia, Gail and Cynthia head into town to sing country & western songs for a talent contest but their young sister, Julie, is forbidden from going because she has a child and is too young until she bribes a fellow neighbour to take her into town. An alcoholic, Irish talent scout, Dave Lovelace, is scolded by his boss for being late despite him sleeping in his car that is near work. Despite being the best act in the contest, the girls not only do not win, but are told to leave. Dave recognizes their talent and discovers that the troops need singers for Vietnam. Soon, Dave goes to make a call and he says they have been granted a spot to audition in Melbourne. Back at their place, Gail, Cynthia and Julie's mother tells him he can take them but without Julie, until Julie's father tells him not to worry about her. Advised by their grandmother, they meet up with their cousin Kay, who had been living in Melbourne for 10 years after the government took her from her family during the stolen generations, because she was half white. She rejects the offer of joining them, but later changes her mind and meets up at their uncle's place. After days of practising their moves, they are almost ready until Julie gives Cynthia a letter from her fianc\u00e9 that he is going to call it off. Despite that, they manage to audition very well and Kay comes up with the group's name, The Sapphires, after looking at Cynthia's engagement ring.\n\nThe Sapphires are a success with the crowds, but infighting among the women threatens to tear the group apart: Gail acts as the group's aggressive matriarch. Kay struggles with her multi-ethnic identity because 10 years earlier she was taken away from the family by the Government, along with thousands of other fairer-skinned Aboriginal children and sent to live in institutions where they were to be raised 'white'. Julie proves to be the group's best voice with a shot at a singing career. Dave and Gail begin a romance, but his reckless behaviour and a personal secret push Gail's patience to the limit.\n\nWhen The Sapphires do another gig, Cynthia drinks with some of the men and is not allowed to go on again. Later, Dave and Gail talk a little before Dave hands her a letter, telling her to open it later and are about to kiss when they are caught in the crossfire of war; Dave disappears in the chaos and gets shot. The girls manage to escape in a helicopter. At home, Gail reads Dave's letter and realizes he wanted to propose to her, but it was her choice. The women band together and finish their tour. Dave survives and Gail is reunited with him in a Vietnam hospital. The Sapphires return to Australia and Gail and Dave announce to the family that they plan to marry. The Sapphires give a joyous performance for their friends and family in the yard of their home.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris O'Dowd]] as Dave Lovelace\n* [[Deborah Mailman]] as Gail\n** Tanika Lonesborough as Young Gail\n* [[Jessica Mauboy]] as Julie\n** Miah Madden as Young Julie\n* [[Shari Sebbens]] as Kay\n** Nioka Brennan as Young Kay\n* [[Miranda Tapsell]] as Cynthia\n** Ava Jean Miller-Porter as Young Cynthia\n* Don Battee as Myron\n* [[Tory Kittles]] as Robby\n* [[Eka Darville]] as Hendo\n* [[Kylie Belling]] as Geraldine\n* [[Judith Lucy]] as Merle\n* [[Georgina Haig]] as Glynis\n* [[Rhys Muldoon]] as Uncle Ed\n* [[Barry Southgate]] and A.
