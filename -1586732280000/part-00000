For since he was an incorporeal power, and the Nous (mind) of the unborn father, he transfigured himself as he pleased, and thus ascended to him who had sent him, deriding them, inasmuch as he could not be laid hold of, and was invisible to all\" ([http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103124.htm Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', book I, ch. 24, 4]).</ref>\n\n=== Gnosticism ===\nSome scriptures identified as Gnostic reject the atonement of Jesus' death by distinguishing the earthly body of Jesus and his divine and immaterial essence.

His new parents, ([[Geena Davis]], [[Hugh Laurie]]) are thrilled with him, but everyone else is not. Through a series of adventures he eventually gains the love of his big brother George, ([[Jonathan Lipnicki]]), acceptance by the extended Little family, and even the grudging tolerance of the family cat Snowbell (voiced by [[Nathan Lane]]), who is a member of an alley cat [[Mafia]]-like gang that wants to kill Stuart.\n\n===''Stuart Little 2'' (2002)===\n{{Main|Stuart Little 2}}\nIn the sequel, Stuart and his brother George ([[Jonathan Lipnicki]]) are attending school together, but his mother ([[Geena Davis]]) doesn't seem to think Stuart is capable of taking care of himself. Later, Stuart meets a bird named Margalo ([[Melanie Griffith]]) who he unintentionally saves from an evil Falcon ([[James Woods]]) and eventually becomes smitten with. But one day when Margalo is nowhere to be found, Stuart and Snowbell ([[Nathan Lane]]) team up to go and find her.\n\n===''Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild'' (2005)===\n{{Main|Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild}}\nIn the third film, Stuart ([[Michael J. Fox]]) and his family are spending their summer vacation at a lakeside cabin near Lake Garland. Stuart signs up to be a lake-scout in an attempt to prove to his mother ([[Geena Davis]]) that he doesn't need to be watched over all the time. Soon, Stuart meets a new friend: a skunk named Reeko ([[Wayne Brady]]) whom he quickly befriends. But when a ferocious mountain lion named the Beast ([[Virginia Madsen]]) hatches a plot to eat Snowbell ([[Kevin Schon]]), Stuart must gather up all his courage to save him.\n\n===Possible reboot===\nIt was reported by the Tracking Board and [[Zimbio, Inc|Zimbio]] that a new ''Stuart Little'' film was in development by [[Sony Pictures Animation]] and [[Red Wagon Productions]] with [[Douglas Wick]] and [[Lucy Fisher]] returning as the producers.

The Arrest.'' By [[Arthur Wallis Mills]], originally published in 1910 in ''[[Punch Magazine|Punch]]'' and ''The [[Wanganui Chronicle]]''.]]\n'''Edith Margaret Garrud''' (1872\u20131971) was among the first female professional [[martial arts]] instructors in the [[Western world]]. She trained the [[Bodyguard]] unit of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) in [[jujutsu]] [[self-defence]] techniques.\n\n== Early life ==\nShe was born '''Edith Margaret Williams''' in 1872 in [[Bath, Somerset]]. Five years later, her family moved to [[Wales]], where she remained until circa 1893. She married William Garrud, a [[physical culture]] instructor specializing in gymnastics, [[boxing]] and [[wrestling]]. They moved to London, where William found work as a physical culture trainer for several [[universities]].\n\nIn 1899, the Garruds were introduced to the art of jiu jitsu by [[Edward William Barton-Wright]], the first jiu jitsu teacher in Europe and the founder of the eclectic martial art of [[Bartitsu]]. Five years later, they became students at the jiu jitsu school of the former Bartitsu Club instructor [[Sadakazu Uyenishi]] in [[Golden Square]], [[Soho]]. In 1907, Edith was featured as the protagonist in a short film entitled ''Jiu-jitsu Downs the Footpads'', which was produced by the [[Path\u00e9]] Film Company.\n\nWhen Uyenishi left England in 1908, William took over as the owner and manager of the Golden Square school and Edith became the instructor of the women's and children's classes.\n\nThe Garruds popularised jujutsu by performing numerous exhibitions throughout London and by writing articles for [[magazines]]. Beginning in 1908, Edith also taught classes for the \"Suffragettes Self-Defence Club\", which was only open to members of the Suffrage movement. From 1911, these classes were based at the Palladium Academy, a dance school in Argyll Street.\n\nIn January 1911, Edith Garrud choreographed the fight scenes for a polemic play entitled ''What Every Woman Ought to Know''. In August that year, one of her articles on women's self-defence was published in ''Health and Strength'' magazine.\n\n== Trainer of bodyguards ==\nIn 1913, the Asquith government instituted the so-called [[Cat and Mouse Act]] whereby [[Suffragette]] leaders on [[hunger strikes]] could legally be released from jail in order to recover their health and then re-arrested on the original charge.  The WSPU responded by establishing a thirty-member, all-woman protection unit referred to as \"the Bodyguard\", the \"Jiujitsuffragettes\" and the \"Amazons\", to protect fugitive suffragettes from re-arrest. Edith Garrud became the very first trainer of the Bodyguard and taught them jujutsu and the use of [[Indian club]]s as defensive weapons. Their lessons took place in a succession of secret locations to avoid the attention of the police.\n\nThe Bodyguard fought a number of well-publicised [[hand-to-hand combat]]s with police officers who were attempting to arrest their leaders, most famously during the so-called \"Battle of Glasgow\" on 9 March 1914 and during the WSPU \"Raid on Buckingham Palace\" on 24 May 1914.\n\nOn several occasions they were also able to stage successful escapes and rescues, making use of [[Military tactics|tactics]] such as [[disguise]] and the use of [[decoy]]s to confuse the police.  A number of these incidents are described in the unpublished memoir of Bodyguard member [[Katherine \"Kitty\" Marshall]], titled \"Suffragette Escapes and Adventures\".  Journalists coined the term \"suffrajitsu\" - a portmanteau of \"suffragette\" and \"jiujitsu\" - to describe their techniques of self-defence, sabotage and subterfuge.\n\nThe Bodyguard was disbanded shortly after the onset of the First World War. WSPU leader [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] had decided to suspend militant suffrage actions and to support the British Government during the crisis, and therefore no longer required protection.\n\n== Later life ==\nEdith and William Garrud continued to work as self-defence and jujutsu instructors until 1925, when they sold their school and appear to have retired from public life. There is some evidence to suggest that they may have been successful as investors in the property market. Edith is recorded as having made several contributions to various charitable causes during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn 1966, on her 94th birthday, Edith Garrud was the subject of an extensive feature article published in ''[[Woman (UK magazine)|Woman]]'' magazine.\n\nIn 1971 she died at the age of 99.\n\n== Portrayals in popular culture ==\nEdith Garrud was portrayed by the actresses Judith Lowe and Jeanne Dorree for the [[Channel 4]] [[docudrama]] ''The Year of the Bodyguard'' (1982), with Lowe playing Garrud circa 1913 and Dorree playing the elderly Garrud circa 1967.\n\nHer involvement with the Suffragettes is portrayed in Ann Bertram's play ''The Good Fight'' (2012), the story of the suffragette [[Grace Roe]] as performed by Theatre Unbound<ref name=\"theatre\">{{cite web | url=http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/arts/theater/the-good-fight-theatre-unbound-review | title=Theatre Unbound's jujitsu suffragettes fight \"The Good Fight\" | publisher=Daily Planet | date=1 October 2012 | accessdate=21 November 2012 | author=Everett, Matthew}}</ref> and in Peter Hilton's play ''Mrs Garrud's Dojo'' (2003).<ref>Hilton, Peter, ''Mrs Garrud's Dojo; A play in two scenes and three songs'', 2003, New York, NY.</ref>\n\nEdith Garrud also makes a cameo appearance in Issue #1 of the graphic novel trilogy ''[[Suffrajitsu: Mrs. Pankhurst's Amazons]]'' (January 2015) and appears as a supporting character in the spin-off novella ''The Second-Story Girl''.\n\nThe character of Edith Ellyn in ''[[Suffragette (film)|Suffragette]]'' was somewhat inspired by Edith Garrud. [[Helena Bonham Carter]] modeled her performance after Garrud and requested the character's name be changed from Caroline to Edith in her honour. The film includes a brief scene in which Mrs. Ellyn teaches self-defence to a group of radical suffragettes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/117127-is-edith-in-suffragette-based-on-a-real-person-the-movie-took-inspiration-from-actual-fighters |author=Olivia Truffaut-Wong |title=Is Edith In 'Suffragette' Based On A Real Person?

Their lessons took place in a succession of secret locations to avoid the attention of the police.\n\nThe Bodyguard fought a number of well-publicised [[hand-to-hand combat]]s with police officers who were attempting to arrest their leaders, most famously during the so-called \"Battle of Glasgow\" on 9 March 1914 and during the WSPU \"Raid on Buckingham Palace\" on 24 May 1914.\n\nOn several occasions they were also able to stage successful escapes and rescues, making use of [[Military tactics|tactics]] such as [[disguise]] and the use of [[decoy]]s to confuse the police.  A number of these incidents are described in the unpublished memoir of Bodyguard member [[Katherine \"Kitty\" Marshall]], titled \"Suffragette Escapes and Adventures\".  Journalists coined the term \"suffrajitsu\" - a portmanteau of \"suffragette\" and \"jiujitsu\" - to describe their techniques of self-defence, sabotage and subterfuge.\n\nThe Bodyguard was disbanded shortly after the onset of the First World War. WSPU leader [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] had decided to suspend militant suffrage actions and to support the British Government during the crisis, and therefore no longer required protection.\n\n== Later life ==\nEdith and William Garrud continued to work as self-defence and jujutsu instructors until 1925, when they sold their school and appear to have retired from public life. There is some evidence to suggest that they may have been successful as investors in the property market. Edith is recorded as having made several contributions to various charitable causes during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn 1966, on her 94th birthday, Edith Garrud was the subject of an extensive feature article published in ''[[Woman (UK magazine)|Woman]]'' magazine.\n\nIn 1971 she died at the age of 99.\n\n== Portrayals in popular culture ==\nEdith Garrud was portrayed by the actresses Judith Lowe and Jeanne Dorree for the [[Channel 4]] [[docudrama]] ''The Year of the Bodyguard'' (1982), with Lowe playing Garrud circa 1913 and Dorree playing the elderly Garrud circa 1967.\n\nHer involvement with the Suffragettes is portrayed in Ann Bertram's play ''The Good Fight'' (2012), the story of the suffragette [[Grace Roe]] as performed by Theatre Unbound<ref name=\"theatre\">{{cite web | url=http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/arts/theater/the-good-fight-theatre-unbound-review | title=Theatre Unbound's jujitsu suffragettes fight \"The Good Fight\" | publisher=Daily Planet | date=1 October 2012 | accessdate=21 November 2012 | author=Everett, Matthew}}</ref> and in Peter Hilton's play ''Mrs Garrud's Dojo'' (2003).<ref>Hilton, Peter, ''Mrs Garrud's Dojo; A play in two scenes and three songs'', 2003, New York, NY.</ref>\n\nEdith Garrud also makes a cameo appearance in Issue #1 of the graphic novel trilogy ''[[Suffrajitsu: Mrs. Pankhurst's Amazons]]'' (January 2015) and appears as a supporting character in the spin-off novella ''The Second-Story Girl''.\n\nThe character of Edith Ellyn in ''[[Suffragette (film)|Suffragette]]'' was somewhat inspired by Edith Garrud. [[Helena Bonham Carter]] modeled her performance after Garrud and requested the character's name be changed from Caroline to Edith in her honour. The film includes a brief scene in which Mrs. Ellyn teaches self-defence to a group of radical suffragettes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/117127-is-edith-in-suffragette-based-on-a-real-person-the-movie-took-inspiration-from-actual-fighters |author=Olivia Truffaut-Wong |title=Is Edith In 'Suffragette' Based On A Real Person?

The tale was first published in [[Copenhagen, Denmark|Copenhagen]] by C.A. Reitzel on 2&nbsp;October 1838 in the first booklet of ''Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection.'' The booklet consists of Andersen's \"The Daisy\" and \"[[The Wild Swans]]\". The tale was Andersen's first not based upon a folk tale or a literary model.  \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\" has been adapted to various media including ballet and animated film.\n\n==Plot==\nOn his birthday, a boy receives a set of 25 [[toy soldiers]] all [[Hand mould|cast]] from one old tin spoon and arrays them on a table top. One soldier stands on a single leg, as having been the last one cast there was not enough metal to make him whole. Nearby, the soldier spies a pretty paper ballerina with a [[Sequin|spangle]] on her sash. She, too, is standing on one leg, and the soldier falls in love. That night, a [[goblin]] among the toys in the form of a [[jack-in-the-box]], who also loves the ballerina, angrily warns the soldier to take his eyes off her, but the soldier ignores him.\n\nThe next day, the soldier falls from a [[windowsill]] (presumably the work of the goblin) and lands in the street. Two boys find the soldier, place him in a paper boat, and set him sailing in the gutter. The boat and its passenger wash into a storm drain, where a [[rat]] demands the soldier pay a toll.\n\nSailing on, the boat is washed into a [[canal]], where the tin soldier is swallowed by a [[fish]]. When this fish is caught and cut open, the tin soldier finds himself once again on the table top before the ballerina. Inexplicably, the boy throws the tin soldier into the [[fire]], which is most likely the work of the jack-in-the-box goblin. A wind blows the ballerina into the fire with him; she is consumed by it. The maid cleans the fireplace in the morning and finds that the soldier has melted into a little tin heart, along with the ballerina's spangle, which is now burned black as coal.\n\n==Publication==\nThe tale was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark by C. A. Reitzel on 2&nbsp;October 1838 in ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children (1838)|Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. First booklet.]]''  Other tales in the booklet include \"The Daisy\" and \"The Wild Swans\". The tale was republished in collected editions of Andersen's work, first, on 18&nbsp;December 1849 in ''Fairy Tales'' and again on 15&nbsp;December 1862 in the first volume of ''Fairy Tales and Stories''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/info_e.html?vid=20 |title=Hans Christian Andersen: The Steadfast Tin Soldier |publisher=The Hans Christian Andersen Center |accessdate=2009-09-22}}</ref>\n\n==Commentaries==\n[[File:C.A. Jensen 1836 - HC Andersen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Andersen in 1836]]\n\n\"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\" is the first tale Andersen wrote that has neither a literary model nor a folk tale source. It marks a new independence in his writing, and is the zenith of his evocation of the nineteenth-century nursery world with its toy dancers, castles, and swans.\n\nJoan G. Haahr writes in ''The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales'': \"The story is unusual among Andersen's early tales, both in its emphasis on sensual desire and in its ambiguities. Blind fate, not intention, determines all events. Moreover, the narrative questions the very decorum it praises. The tin soldier's passive acceptance of whatever happens to him, while exemplifying [[pietist]]ic ideals of self-denial, also contributes to his doom. Were he to speak and act, the soldier might gain both life and love. Restrained, however, by inhibition and convention, he finds only tragedy and death. The tale is often read autobiographically, with the soldier viewed as symbolizing Andersen's feelings of inadequacy with women, his passive acceptance of bourgeois class attitudes, or his sense of alienation as an artist and an outsider, from full participation in everyday life.\"<ref name=\"ZipesP497\">Zipes 497</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Adaptations==\n[[File:Vilhelm Pedersen, DK2-0006, ubt.jpeg|thumb|Illustration by [[Vilhelm Pedersen]], Andersen's first illustrator (1850)]]\n\n[[Ub Iwerks]] did a 1934 [[Cinecolor]] cartoon based on the story entitled ''The Brave Tin Soldier''. The cartoon's plot is slightly different from the original story. The antagonist is not a Jack-in-the-Box, but rather a toy king who wants the ballerina for himself. The tin soldier attacks the king, and as a result is put on trial and sentenced to death via firing squad. The ballerina pleads for his life to be spared, but her pleas go ignored. She then stands alongside the tin soldier and both are shot into a burning fireplace, where he melts into the shape of a heart with her. The cartoon has a happy ending, as both the tin soldier and ballerina are sent to \"Toy Heaven\", where the tin soldier now has both legs.\n\n[[George Pal]]'s war-themed 1941 [[Puppetoon]], \"Rhythm in the Ranks\", is likely a loose adaptation of Andersen's story, with a toy soldier getting discharged after falling in love with an ice-skating ballerina.\n\n[[Paul Grimault]] (with [[Jacques Pr\u00e9vert]]) did a 1947 colour French cartoon ''Le Petit Soldat'' that portrayed the title character as a toy acrobat who is called to war and returns crippled but determined to rescue his ballerina.\n\n[[Marcia Brown]]'s 1953 picture book illustrating the story in [[M.

The segment differs slightly from Andersen's tale: there are only five soldiers, but still only one with one leg; the ballerina appears to be made of [[porcelain]]; the soldier is disappointed to discover the ballerina has two legs, but the ballerina still accepts him; at the end, the jack-in-the-box villain is the one that perishes in the fire instead of the soldier and ballerina who both remain in one piece.<ref name=\"Andersen2008P224\">Andersen 2008 224</ref>  Other animated films for children have been produced on the tale, and, in 1975, a science fiction fantasy feature film, ''The Tin Soldier''.<ref name=\"ZipesP497\" />\n \nIn [[Stieg Larsson]]'s 2006 thriller ''[[The Girl Who Played with Fire]]'', the fiercely independent protagonist [[Lisbeth Salander]] compares the journalist [[Mikael Blomkvist]], who had stayed loyal to her despite her repeated blatant rejection of him, with Andersen's steadfast tin soldier (implicitly comparing herself with Andersen's ballerina).<ref>''The Girl Who Played with Fire'', Chapter 29.</ref>\n\n[[Mike Mignola]]'s graphic novel ''[[Baltimore, or The Steadfast Tin Soldier and the Vampire]]'' fuses the poignancy of \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\" with supernatural [[Dracula]] myths, set in a post-[[World War I]] environment.<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/395603-Fiction_Reviews_Week_of_7_30_2007.php?q=Baltimore%2C+or+the+Steadfast+Tin+Soldier+and+the+Vampire Fiction Reviews: Week of 7/30/2007] at [[Publishers Weekly]].</ref>  [[Kate DiCamillo]]'s ''[[The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane]]'' (2006) makes use of the tale's themes.<ref name=\"Andersen2008P224\" />\n\nThe [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] song Soldier is also based on this fairy tale.

The cartoon has a happy ending, as both the tin soldier and ballerina are sent to \"Toy Heaven\", where the tin soldier now has both legs.\n\n[[George Pal]]'s war-themed 1941 [[Puppetoon]], \"Rhythm in the Ranks\", is likely a loose adaptation of Andersen's story, with a toy soldier getting discharged after falling in love with an ice-skating ballerina.\n\n[[Paul Grimault]] (with [[Jacques Pr\u00e9vert]]) did a 1947 colour French cartoon ''Le Petit Soldat'' that portrayed the title character as a toy acrobat who is called to war and returns crippled but determined to rescue his ballerina.\n\n[[Marcia Brown]]'s 1953 picture book illustrating the story in [[M. R. James]]'s translation was awarded a [[Caldecott Honor]].\n\n[[Ivo Caprino]]'s 1955 puppet movie \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\".\n\n[[Shawn Phillips]]'s 1964 song 'Little Tin Soldier' is also based on the Hans Christian Andersen tale and was covered by [[Donovan]] in 1965.\n\nThe music video of [[Anastacia]]'s 2005 song [[Heavy On My Heart]] was inspired by The Steadfast Tin Soldier, in which it features mannequins in a shop window.\n\nThe [[Small Faces]] 1967 song [[Tin Soldier (song)|Tin Soldier]] opens with the lyric \"I am a little tin soldier that wants to jump into your fire\", and appears to have been influenced by the Andersen story.\n\nAndersen's contemporary [[August Bournonville]] choreographed the tale for his ballet ''A Fairy Tale in Pictures'', and [[George Balanchine]] choreographed the tale in 1975, allowing the soldier and the ballerina to express their love before the ballerina is blown into the fire.<ref name=\"Andersen2008P224\" />  [[George Bizet]] set the tale to music in ''Jeux d'Enfants''.<ref name=\"Andersen2008P224\" />\n\nIn 1976, [[Soyuzmultfilm]] made an [[The Steadfast Tin Soldier (1976 film)|animated adaptation]].\n\nA live action musical adaptation was the second of four episodes of The Enchanted Musical Playhouse that originally aired from 1984 to 1985 on the (then) brand new Disney Channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Steadfast Tin Soldier - The Enchanted Musical Playhouse|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS2Lv2S35jc|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1985/0830/lvideo.html|title=`Enchanted Musical Playhouse' series fills gap in home video for children| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128031930/https://www.csmonitor.com/1985/0830/lvideo.html|archivedate=January 28, 2019|last=Bunce|first=Alan|date=August 30, 1985|work=The Christian Science Monitor|access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Harmony Gold made an English dub of The Little Train adaptation of the story, the film was originally made in Italy in the late 70s.\n\nIn 1986, [[Atkinson Film-Arts]] made an animated adaptation featuring the voices of [[Rick Jones (voice actor)|Rick Jones]], [[Terrence Scammell (Canadian actor)|Terrence Scammell]], and Robert Bockstael, with narration by [[Christopher Plummer]].\n\nIn 1989, [[Studio Miniatur Filmowych]] made an animated adaptation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://filmpolski.pl/fp/index.php?film=4220274 | title=FilmPolski.pl}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, it was adapted into an animated television movie as part of [[Timeless Tales from Hallmark]] which was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]] and [[Hallmark]]. It featured the voices of [[George Newbern]] as the Tin Soldier, [[Megan Mullally]] as the Ballerina, [[Tim Curry]] as the Jack-in-the-box and [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] as a frog named Frogbauten. It was Curry's second clown role after he played [[It (character)|Pennywise]] in ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'' (1990).\n\nChildren's author [[Tor Seidler]] adapted the book in 1992, with illustrations by [[Fred Marcellino]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1038348.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120200927/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1038348.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2018-11-20 | title=Yule Bookshelf| newspaper=The Washington Post| date=1992-12-06| last1=Dirda| first1=Michael}}</ref>\n\n1995 saw [[Jon Voight]] make his directorial debut with ''The Tin Soldier'', a [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] family film loosely based on Andersen's story.\n\nIn 1996, Vivian Little and Kathleen Mills adapted Anderson's story into a full-length ballet for the Dance Fremont studio in [[Seattle]]. The ballet is still produced every winter, as an alternative to the popular Christmas ballet ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', which many American studios produce in December. Dance Fremont centers the story around a young deaf boy who receives the toys for Christmas, and uses [[Signing Exact English|Signed Exact English]] for all dialogue.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://dancefremont.com/about-steadfast-tin-soldier/| title=About the Steadfast Tin Soldier}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s film ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', an adaptation of the tale is set to the first movement of the [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Shostakovich)|Piano Concerto No. 2 in F Major]] by [[Dmitri Shostakovich]].  The segment differs slightly from Andersen's tale: there are only five soldiers, but still only one with one leg; the ballerina appears to be made of [[porcelain]]; the soldier is disappointed to discover the ballerina has two legs, but the ballerina still accepts him; at the end, the jack-in-the-box villain is the one that perishes in the fire instead of the soldier and ballerina who both remain in one piece.<ref name=\"Andersen2008P224\">Andersen 2008 224</ref>  Other animated films for children have been produced on the tale, and, in 1975, a science fiction fantasy feature film, ''The Tin Soldier''.<ref name=\"ZipesP497\" />\n \nIn [[Stieg Larsson]]'s 2006 thriller ''[[The Girl Who Played with Fire]]'', the fiercely independent protagonist [[Lisbeth Salander]] compares the journalist [[Mikael Blomkvist]], who had stayed loyal to her despite her repeated blatant rejection of him, with Andersen's steadfast tin soldier (implicitly comparing herself with Andersen's ballerina).<ref>''The Girl Who Played with Fire'', Chapter 29.</ref>\n\n[[Mike Mignola]]'s graphic novel ''[[Baltimore, or The Steadfast Tin Soldier and the Vampire]]'' fuses the poignancy of \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\" with supernatural [[Dracula]] myths, set in a post-[[World War I]] environment.<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/395603-Fiction_Reviews_Week_of_7_30_2007.php?q=Baltimore%2C+or+the+Steadfast+Tin+Soldier+and+the+Vampire Fiction Reviews: Week of 7/30/2007] at [[Publishers Weekly]].</ref>  [[Kate DiCamillo]]'s ''[[The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane]]'' (2006) makes use of the tale's themes.<ref name=\"Andersen2008P224\" />\n\nThe [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] song Soldier is also based on this fairy tale. The song doesn't mention the goblin at all. The tin soldier fell out the window when the wind blew and the tin soldier and ballerina melted together while dancing and the ballerina fell near the fireplace.\n\nIn Anirudh Arun's 2013 [[bildungsroman]] ''The Steadfast Tin Soldier?'', the protagonist Ashwin is compared to the tin soldier by his successful brother Abhinav (the society thus plays the part of the dangerous jack-in-the-box).<ref>''The Steadfast Tin Soldier?'', Chapter \"There and Back Again\"</ref>\n\n[[Daft Punk]]'s music video for the song \"[[Instant Crush]]\" is said to have been inspired by \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\".\n\n{{portal|Novels}}\n\n==References==\n;Footnotes\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Works cited\n* {{citation |author=Andersen, Hans Christian |author2=Tatar, Maria (Ed. and transl.) |year=2008 |title=The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen |location=New Yorkand London |publisher=W.
