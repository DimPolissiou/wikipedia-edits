The funds were more likely to be spent on children's clothes, education and general well being for both girls and boys.<ref name=\"wkfs\" />\n\n====Climate change====\nOne of the areas of research for the IFPRI is the effects of [[climate change]] on developing countries. Climate change describes a global change in the climate, but this does not mean that all areas of the globe will be affected equally or that they will all experience the same type of climate change. Some areas may become warmer while others may become colder. The IFPRI has conducted studies to model the effects of climate change on developing populations.\n\nIn 2011, IFPRI published the results of a study in The Republic of [[Yemen]] predicting the economic outcome of climate change in [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] Yemeni communities. The study predicted that the country's [[GDP]] would drop, but that agricultural GDP would increase. It predicted that flooding would cause farmers to lose some crops, but agriculture in general would benefit. The group expected to suffer the most would be rural non-farmers. In the long term, climate change was predicted to damage [[food security]] and cause a decrease in household GDP.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wiebelt |first=Manfred |author2=Clemens Breisinger |author3=Olivier Ecker |author4=Perrihan Al-Riffai |author5=Richard D.

They have conducted research all over the world on various issues that arise from or cause malnutrition. They have looked at [[HIV]] and [[Malaria]] and how malnutrition affects the [[epidemiology]] of these diseases. They have looked at the effects of childhood malnutrition on adult health. They have looked at the potential benefits of [[biotech]] crops on childhood nutrition, and the effects of vitamin supplements in general.\n\nA study in [[Ethiopia]] to test cost effectiveness of two different methods of treating malnutrition in children was done by Tekeste Asayehegn. In the study the compared two different methods of long term care for the malnourished children. In the first method children were brought to Therapeutic Feeding Centers where they remained as in-patients. The alternative method involved the supplies to treat malnourished children being sent to local clinics and healthcare facilities where the children were brought on a weekly or fortnight basis for treatment. The nutritional supplements were then sent home with the children. Volunteers checked on the patients at home and brought them to the facilities for treatment. This localized treatment program was found to cut the cost of treating a malnourished child in half.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tekeste |first=Asayehegn |author2=Mekitie Wondafrash |author3=Girma Azene |author4=Kebede Deribe |title=Cost effectiveness of community-based and in-patient therapeutic feeding programs to treat severe acute malnutrition in Ethiopia |journal=Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation |date=March 19, 2012 |doi=10.1186/1478-7547-10-4 |pmc=3323427 |pmid=22429892 |volume=10 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nIn Uganda the IFPRI conducted a study on the relationship between malnutrition and the incidences of malaria. There were two variables in the study the first was evidence of [[malnutrition]] in the child and the second was whether or not the child was infected with [[HIV]]. The study indicated that there may be a correlation between malnutrition and increased risk of malaria. Both the HIV-negative and positive patients that were malnourished showed higher rates of [[malaria]] than the groups with better nutrition.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Arinaitwe |first=Emmanuel |display-authors=etal |title=The association between malnutrition and the incidence of malaria among young HIV-infected and -uninfected Ugandan children: a prospective study |journal=[[Malaria Journal]] |date=March 27, 2012 |doi=10.1186/1475-2875-11-90 |pmc=3337276 |pmid=22453048 |volume=11 |page=90}}</ref>\n\n====Transgenic crops====\nIFPRI neither supports nor opposes [[genetically modified foods]]; however, they have released many publications on the potential impact of using [[transgenic crops]]. There are many types of transgenic crops. Some modify the plant's ability to produce natural pesticides while others affect the nutritional value of the crops themselves. In 2009 IFPRI released a publication that was an overview of the use of [[biotech]] crops between 1997 and 2007. Since the institute maintains a neutral standpoint on the subject, they chose the term \"biotech\" as being less inflammatory than \"genetically modified\" or \"transgenic\".<ref name=\"meitc\">{{cite book |last=Smale |first=Melinda |display-authors=etal |title=Measuring the economic impacts of transgenic crops in developing agriculture during the first decade |publisher=IFPRI |year=2009 |url=https://www.ifpri.org/cdmref/p15738coll2/id/26575/filename/26576.pdf |pages=xiii\u2013xiv}}</ref> The publication was a review of many studies conducted during the ten-year time period in several countries around the world.\n\nThey observed that many of the studies were inconclusive in terms of the economic value of a crop. For instance, the studies showed conclusively that the use of [[Bt cotton]] reduced the need for pesticide treatment and increased crop yield, but they did not show whether it increased profits for the small farms involved.<ref name=\"meitc\" /> They determined that the information provided to the consumer was important in these studies. Negative messages were very effective at dissuading use.\n\nOverall, the researchers determined that some strains of biotech crops were economically promising especially in countries like [[India]] and [[China]]. They were unwilling to make too strong a judgment on the data provided recommending better studies be conducted over the following ten years to obtain a more complete understanding of the economic effects of biotech crops in developing countries.<ref name=\"meitc\" /> This publication made no observations about potential environmental or health related issues involved with the crops. It simply dealt with potential profits and economic impact.\n\nIFPRI also analyzes agricultural market reforms, trade policy, [[World Trade Organization]] negotiations in the context of agriculture, institutional effectiveness, crop and income diversification, postharvest activity, and [[Intensive farming|agroindustry]].<ref name=\"mti\">[http://www.ifpri.org/division/markets-trade-and-institutions-mtid \"Markets, Trade, and Institutions (MTID)\"], IFPRI.</ref>\n\nThe institute is involved in measuring the [[Millennium Development Goals]] project and supports governments in the formulation and implementation of development strategies.<ref name=\"dsg\">[http://www.ifpri.org/division/development-strategy-and-governance-dsgd \"Development Strategy and Governance (DSGD)\"], IFPRI.</ref>\n\nFurther work includes research on agricultural [[innovation system]]s and the role of capacity strengthening in agricultural development.<ref name=\"kci\">[http://www.ifpri.org/book-36/ourwork/division/knowledge-capacity-and-innovation Knowledge, Capacity, and Innovation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626075634/http://www.ifpri.org/book-36/ourwork/division/knowledge-capacity-and-innovation |date=June 26, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Products and publications===\nIFPRI targets its policy and research products to many audiences, including developing-country policymakers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and civil-society organizations, \"opinion leaders\", donors, advisers, and media.\n\nPublications by IFPRI include books, research reports, but also newsletters, briefs, and fact sheets,<ref>IFPRI's [http://www.ifpri.org/publications Publications & Tools]</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2017}} which are also available from IFPRI's Knowledge Repository.<ref>http://ebrary.ifpri.org/</ref> It is also involved in the collection of primary data and the compilation and processing of secondary data.<ref>http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/IFPRI</ref>\n\nThe [http://www.ifpri.org/topic/global-food-policy-report Global Food Policy Report] is one of IFPRI's flagship publications.

They found that the majority of resources are devoted to plots controlled by men, but if resources were diverted to plots controlled by women productivity could increase by as much as 20%. In another study in [[Kenya]], where women get almost no education, they determined that if women farmers were provided one year of primary education, maize production could increase by as much as 24%.<ref name=\"wkfs\">{{cite web |author=|title=Women, the Key to Food Security |publisher=IFPRI |date=June 2000 |url=http://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/125453/filename/125454.pdf}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2017}}\n\nStudies conducted in [[Egypt]] and [[Mozambique]] found that the education level of adult females in a household is more important than the education level of adult males to bring a household out of poverty.

The funds were more likely to be spent on children's clothes, education and general well being for both girls and boys.<ref name=\"wkfs\" />\n\n====Climate change====\nOne of the areas of research for the IFPRI is the effects of [[climate change]] on developing countries. Climate change describes a global change in the climate, but this does not mean that all areas of the globe will be affected equally or that they will all experience the same type of climate change. Some areas may become warmer while others may become colder. The IFPRI has conducted studies to model the effects of climate change on developing populations.\n\nIn 2011, IFPRI published the results of a study in The Republic of [[Yemen]] predicting the economic outcome of climate change in [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] Yemeni communities. The study predicted that the country's [[GDP]] would drop, but that agricultural GDP would increase. It predicted that flooding would cause farmers to lose some crops, but agriculture in general would benefit. The group expected to suffer the most would be rural non-farmers. In the long term, climate change was predicted to damage [[food security]] and cause a decrease in household GDP.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wiebelt |first=Manfred |author2=Clemens Breisinger |author3=Olivier Ecker |author4=Perrihan Al-Riffai |author5=Richard D.

They have conducted research all over the world on various issues that arise from or cause malnutrition. They have looked at [[HIV]] and [[Malaria]] and how malnutrition affects the [[epidemiology]] of these diseases. They have looked at the effects of childhood malnutrition on adult health. They have looked at the potential benefits of [[biotech]] crops on childhood nutrition, and the effects of vitamin supplements in general.\n\nA study in [[Ethiopia]] to test cost effectiveness of two different methods of treating malnutrition in children was done by Tekeste Asayehegn. In the study the compared two different methods of long term care for the malnourished children. In the first method children were brought to Therapeutic Feeding Centers where they remained as in-patients. The alternative method involved the supplies to treat malnourished children being sent to local clinics and healthcare facilities where the children were brought on a weekly or fortnight basis for treatment. The nutritional supplements were then sent home with the children. Volunteers checked on the patients at home and brought them to the facilities for treatment. This localized treatment program was found to cut the cost of treating a malnourished child in half.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tekeste |first=Asayehegn |author2=Mekitie Wondafrash |author3=Girma Azene |author4=Kebede Deribe |title=Cost effectiveness of community-based and in-patient therapeutic feeding programs to treat severe acute malnutrition in Ethiopia |journal=Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation |date=March 19, 2012 |doi=10.1186/1478-7547-10-4 |pmc=3323427 |pmid=22429892 |volume=10 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nIn Uganda the IFPRI conducted a study on the relationship between malnutrition and the incidences of malaria. There were two variables in the study the first was evidence of [[malnutrition]] in the child and the second was whether or not the child was infected with [[HIV]]. The study indicated that there may be a correlation between malnutrition and increased risk of malaria. Both the HIV-negative and positive patients that were malnourished showed higher rates of [[malaria]] than the groups with better nutrition.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Arinaitwe |first=Emmanuel |display-authors=etal |title=The association between malnutrition and the incidence of malaria among young HIV-infected and -uninfected Ugandan children: a prospective study |journal=[[Malaria Journal]] |date=March 27, 2012 |doi=10.1186/1475-2875-11-90 |pmc=3337276 |pmid=22453048 |volume=11 |page=90}}</ref>\n\n====Transgenic crops====\nIFPRI neither supports nor opposes [[genetically modified foods]]; however, they have released many publications on the potential impact of using [[transgenic crops]]. There are many types of transgenic crops. Some modify the plant's ability to produce natural pesticides while others affect the nutritional value of the crops themselves. In 2009 IFPRI released a publication that was an overview of the use of [[biotech]] crops between 1997 and 2007. Since the institute maintains a neutral standpoint on the subject, they chose the term \"biotech\" as being less inflammatory than \"genetically modified\" or \"transgenic\".<ref name=\"meitc\">{{cite book |last=Smale |first=Melinda |display-authors=etal |title=Measuring the economic impacts of transgenic crops in developing agriculture during the first decade |publisher=IFPRI |year=2009 |url=https://www.ifpri.org/cdmref/p15738coll2/id/26575/filename/26576.pdf |pages=xiii\u2013xiv}}</ref> The publication was a review of many studies conducted during the ten-year time period in several countries around the world.\n\nThey observed that many of the studies were inconclusive in terms of the economic value of a crop. For instance, the studies showed conclusively that the use of [[Bt cotton]] reduced the need for pesticide treatment and increased crop yield, but they did not show whether it increased profits for the small farms involved.<ref name=\"meitc\" /> They determined that the information provided to the consumer was important in these studies. Negative messages were very effective at dissuading use.\n\nOverall, the researchers determined that some strains of biotech crops were economically promising especially in countries like [[India]] and [[China]]. They were unwilling to make too strong a judgment on the data provided recommending better studies be conducted over the following ten years to obtain a more complete understanding of the economic effects of biotech crops in developing countries.<ref name=\"meitc\" /> This publication made no observations about potential environmental or health related issues involved with the crops. It simply dealt with potential profits and economic impact.\n\nIFPRI also analyzes agricultural market reforms, trade policy, [[World Trade Organization]] negotiations in the context of agriculture, institutional effectiveness, crop and income diversification, postharvest activity, and [[Intensive farming|agroindustry]].<ref name=\"mti\">[http://www.ifpri.org/division/markets-trade-and-institutions-mtid \"Markets, Trade, and Institutions (MTID)\"], IFPRI.</ref>\n\nThe institute is involved in measuring the [[Millennium Development Goals]] project and supports governments in the formulation and implementation of development strategies.<ref name=\"dsg\">[http://www.ifpri.org/division/development-strategy-and-governance-dsgd \"Development Strategy and Governance (DSGD)\"], IFPRI.</ref>\n\nFurther work includes research on agricultural [[innovation system]]s and the role of capacity strengthening in agricultural development.<ref name=\"kci\">[http://www.ifpri.org/book-36/ourwork/division/knowledge-capacity-and-innovation Knowledge, Capacity, and Innovation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626075634/http://www.ifpri.org/book-36/ourwork/division/knowledge-capacity-and-innovation |date=June 26, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Products and publications===\nIFPRI targets its policy and research products to many audiences, including developing-country policymakers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and civil-society organizations, \"opinion leaders\", donors, advisers, and media.\n\nPublications by IFPRI include books, research reports, but also newsletters, briefs, and fact sheets,<ref>IFPRI's [http://www.ifpri.org/publications Publications & Tools]</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2017}} which are also available from IFPRI's Knowledge Repository.<ref>http://ebrary.ifpri.org/</ref> It is also involved in the collection of primary data and the compilation and processing of secondary data.<ref>http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/IFPRI</ref>\n\nThe [http://www.ifpri.org/topic/global-food-policy-report Global Food Policy Report] is one of IFPRI's flagship publications.

Trained as a dancer, Loy devoted herself fully to an acting career following a few minor roles in [[silent film]]s. She was originally typecast in exotic roles, often as a [[femme fatale|vamp]] or a woman of Asian descent, but her career prospects improved greatly following her portrayal of [[Nick and Nora Charles|Nora Charles]] in ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'' (1934).{{Sfn|Curtis|2011|page=333}}\n\nBorn in [[Helena, Montana]], Loy was raised in rural [[Radersburg, Montana|Radersburg]] during her early childhood, before relocating to [[Los Angeles]] with her mother in her early adolescence. There, she began studying dance, and trained extensively throughout her high school education. She was discovered by production designer [[Natacha Rambova]], who helped facilitate film auditions for her, and she began obtaining small roles in the late 1920s, mainly portraying vamps. Her role in ''The Thin Man'' helped elevate her reputation as a versatile actress, and she reprised the role of [[Nora Charles]] five more times.\n\nLoy's career began to slow in the 1940s, and she appeared in only a few films in the 1950s, including a lead role in the comedy ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (1950 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' (1950), as well as supporting parts in ''[[The Ambassador's Daughter (1956 film)|The Ambassador's Daughter]]'' (1956) and the drama ''[[Lonelyhearts]]'' (1958). She appeared in only eight films between 1960 and 1981, after which she retired from acting.\n\nAlthough Loy was never nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], in March 1991 she received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Academy Award]] in recognition of her life's work both onscreen and off, including serving as assistant to the director of military and naval welfare for the [[Red Cross]] during [[World War II]], and a member-at-large of the U.S. Commission to [[UNESCO]].

She obtained work at [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]], where she performed in what were called prologues, elaborate musical sequences that were related to and served as preliminary entertainment before the feature film. During this period, Loy saw [[Eleonora Duse]] in the play ''Thy Will Be Done'', and the simple acting techniques she employed made such an impact on Loy that she tried to emulate them throughout her career.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=33\u201334}}\n\n===1925\u20131932: Career beginnings===\n[[File:Myrna-Loy-1925.jpg|thumb|In its September 1925 issue, ''[[Motion Picture Magazine|Motion Picture]]'' magazine featured two Henry Waxman photographs of Loy, costumed by [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], as she appeared in ''[[What Price Beauty?]]'' ]]\n\nWhile Loy was dancing in prologues at the [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]], portrait photographer Henry Waxman took several pictures of her that were noticed by [[Rudolph Valentino]] when the actor went to Waxman's studio for a sitting.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=34\u201338}} Valentino was looking for a leading lady for ''[[Cobra (1925 film)|Cobra]]'', the first independent project he and his wife [[Natacha Rambova]] were producing.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=47\u201348}} Loy tested for the role, which went to [[Gertrude Olmstead]] instead, but soon after she was hired as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]] for ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' (1925), in which she and fellow newcomer [[Joan Crawford]] were among a bevy of chorus girls dangling from an elaborate chandelier.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=37\u201341}}\n\nRambova hired Loy for a small but showy role opposite [[Nita Naldi]] in ''[[What Price Beauty?]]'', a film she was producing.

It took years for her to overcome this stereotype, and as late as 1932, she was cast as a villainous Eurasian in ''[[Thirteen Women]]'' (1932). She also played, opposite [[Boris Karloff]], the depraved sadistic daughter of the title character in ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]'' (1932).\n\nIn 1932, Loy began dating producer [[Arthur Hornblow Jr.]], when he was still married to his wife, Juliette Crosby.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=92}} \nPrior to that, Loy appeared in small roles in ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' and a number of early lavish [[Technicolor]] musicals, including ''[[The Show of Shows]]'', ''[[The Bride of the Regiment]]'', and ''[[Under a Texas Moon (film)|Under a Texas Moon]]''. As a result, she became associated with musical roles, and when they began to lose favor with the public, her career went into a slump. In 1934, Loy appeared in ''[[Manhattan Melodrama]]'' with [[Clark Gable]] and [[William Powell]]. When gangster [[John Dillinger]] was shot to death after leaving a screening of the film at the [[Biograph Theater]] in Chicago, the film received widespread publicity, with some newspapers reporting that Loy had been Dillinger's favorite actress.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|p=97}}\n\n===1933\u20131938: Rise to stardom===\n[[File:Thin-Man-Loy-Powell-Skippy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Loy, [[William Powell]] and [[Skippy (dog)|Asta]] in ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'' (1934)]]\nAfter appearing with [[Ram\u00f3n Novarro]] in ''[[The Barbarian (1933 film)|The Barbarian]]'' (1933), Loy was cast as [[Nick and Nora Charles|Nora Charles]] in the 1934 film ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]''. Director [[W. S. Van Dyke]] chose Loy after he detected a wit and sense of humor that her previous films had not revealed.

Loy received excellent reviews and was acclaimed for her comedic skills. Her costar [[William Powell]] and she proved to be a popular screen couple and appeared in 14 films together, [[William Powell and Myrna Loy|one of the most prolific pairings]] in [[Hollywood]] history.

Such films as ''[[Wife vs. Secretary]]'' (1936) with Clark Gable and [[Jean Harlow]], and ''[[Petticoat Fever]]'' (1936) with [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] gave her opportunity to develop comedic skills. She made four films in close succession with William Powell: ''[[Libeled Lady]]'' (1936), which also starred Jean Harlow and [[Spencer Tracy]]; ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' (1936), in which she played [[Billie Burke]] opposite Powell's [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]; the second Thin Man film, ''[[After the Thin Man]]'' (1936), with Powell and [[James Stewart]]; and the romantic comedy ''[[Double Wedding]]'' (1937).

While working for MGM, Loy was outspoken about the studio's casting hierarchy, especially based on [[race (human categorization)|race]], and was quoted as saying: \"Why does every black person in the movies have to play a servant?

Trained as a dancer, Loy devoted herself fully to an acting career following a few minor roles in [[silent film]]s. She was originally typecast in exotic roles, often as a [[femme fatale|vamp]] or a woman of Asian descent, but her career prospects improved greatly following her portrayal of [[Nick and Nora Charles|Nora Charles]] in ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'' (1934).{{Sfn|Curtis|2011|page=333}}\n\nBorn in [[Helena, Montana]], Loy was raised in rural [[Radersburg, Montana|Radersburg]] during her early childhood, before relocating to [[Los Angeles]] with her mother in her early adolescence. There, she began studying dance, and trained extensively throughout her high school education. She was discovered by production designer [[Natacha Rambova]], who helped facilitate film auditions for her, and she began obtaining small roles in the late 1920s, mainly portraying vamps. Her role in ''The Thin Man'' helped elevate her reputation as a versatile actress, and she reprised the role of [[Nora Charles]] five more times.\n\nLoy's career began to slow in the 1940s, and she appeared in only a few films in the 1950s, including a lead role in the comedy ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (1950 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' (1950), as well as supporting parts in ''[[The Ambassador's Daughter (1956 film)|The Ambassador's Daughter]]'' (1956) and the drama ''[[Lonelyhearts]]'' (1958). She appeared in only eight films between 1960 and 1981, after which she retired from acting.\n\nAlthough Loy was never nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], in March 1991 she received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Academy Award]] in recognition of her life's work both onscreen and off, including serving as assistant to the director of military and naval welfare for the [[Red Cross]] during [[World War II]], and a member-at-large of the U.S. Commission to [[UNESCO]]. Loy died in December 1993 in New York City, aged 88.\n\n==Life and career==\n===1905\u20131924: Early life===\n[[File:Myrna-Loy-1911.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Loy (left) at age six, standing on her grandmother's porch in Helena, Montana, with her cousin Laura Belle Wilder (1911)]]\nLoy was born Myrna Adele Williams on August 2, 1905, in [[Helena, Montana]],{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=1}}{{sfn|Parish|Bowers|1974|p=443}} the daughter of Adelle Mae (n\u00e9e Johnson) and rancher David Franklin Williams.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=1\u20134}} Her parents had married in Helena in 1904, one year before Loy was born.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=13}} She had one younger brother, David Frederick Williams ({{abbr|d.|died}} 1982).{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=385}} Loy's paternal grandfather, David Thomas Williams, was [[Welsh people|Welsh]], and immigrated from [[Liverpool]], England to the United States in 1856, arriving in [[Philadelphia]].{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=9}} Unable to read or write in [[English language|English]], he later settled in the [[Montana Territory]] where he began a career as a rancher.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=9\u201310}} Loy's maternal grandparents were [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Swedes|Swedish]] immigrants.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=10\u201312}}<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Rex Reed|Reed, Rex]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E5DF1F39E63ABC4B52DFB2668382679EDE|title=Myrna's Back \u2013 And Boyer's Got Her|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 13, 1969|accessdate=August 31, 2018}} {{closed access}}</ref> During her childhood, her father worked as a banker, real estate developer, and farmland appraiser in Helena, and was the youngest man ever elected to serve in the [[Montana state legislature]].{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=11\u201312}} Her mother had studied music at the [[American Conservatory of Music]] in Chicago, and at one time considered a career as a concert performer, but instead devoted her time to raising Loy and her brother.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=12}} Loy's mother was a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], while her father was a staunch [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=12}} She was raised in the [[Methodism|Methodist]] faith.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=14}}\n\n[[File:Venice High School Fountain of Education.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Loy modeled for the central figure in Harry Fielding Winebrenner's ''Fountain of Education'', a sculpture at Venice High School in Los Angeles (1922)]]\n\nLoy spent her early life in [[Radersburg, Montana]], a rural mining community approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}}{{sfn|Swartout|2015|p=34}} southeast of Helena.<!--\n--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myrnaloy.org/bio.html|title=About Myrna Loy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705012959/http://www.myrnaloy.org/bio.html |archivedate=July 5, 2008|accessdate=July 20, 2018}}</ref><!--\n--><ref name=loy2>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/multimedia/125newsmakers1/loy.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102212127/http://www.greatfallstribune.com/multimedia/125newsmakers1/loy.html|archivedate=November 2, 2011|title=125 Montana Newsmakers: Myrna Loy Reynolds|work=Great Falls Tribune|location=Great Falls, Montana|date=August 23, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2018}}</ref><!--ENDRef\n--> During the winter of 1912, Loy's mother nearly died from [[pneumonia]], and her father sent his wife and daughter to [[La Jolla, San Diego, California|La Jolla, California]].{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=22}} Loy's mother saw great potential in [[Southern California]], and during one of her husband's visits, she encouraged him to purchase real estate there.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=22\u201323}} Among the properties he bought was land that he would later sell, at a considerable profit, to filmmaker [[Charlie Chaplin]] for his film studio there. Although her mother tried to persuade her husband to move to California permanently, he preferred ranch life and the three eventually returned to Montana. Soon afterward, Loy's mother needed a [[hysterectomy]] and insisted Los Angeles was a safer place to have it done, so she, Loy, and Loy's brother David moved to [[Santa Monica neighborhoods#Ocean Park Neighborhood|Ocean Park]], where Loy began to take dancing lessons.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=22}} After the family returned to Montana, Loy continued her dancing lessons, and at the age of 12, Myrna Williams made her stage debut performing a dance she had choreographed based on \"The Blue Bird\" from the ''Rose Dream'' operetta<ref>Willis, Gertruce Knox and Mrs. R.R.

She obtained work at [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]], where she performed in what were called prologues, elaborate musical sequences that were related to and served as preliminary entertainment before the feature film. During this period, Loy saw [[Eleonora Duse]] in the play ''Thy Will Be Done'', and the simple acting techniques she employed made such an impact on Loy that she tried to emulate them throughout her career.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=33\u201334}}\n\n===1925\u20131932: Career beginnings===\n[[File:Myrna-Loy-1925.jpg|thumb|In its September 1925 issue, ''[[Motion Picture Magazine|Motion Picture]]'' magazine featured two Henry Waxman photographs of Loy, costumed by [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], as she appeared in ''[[What Price Beauty?]]'' ]]\n\nWhile Loy was dancing in prologues at the [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]], portrait photographer Henry Waxman took several pictures of her that were noticed by [[Rudolph Valentino]] when the actor went to Waxman's studio for a sitting.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=34\u201338}} Valentino was looking for a leading lady for ''[[Cobra (1925 film)|Cobra]]'', the first independent project he and his wife [[Natacha Rambova]] were producing.{{sfn|Leider|2011|pages=47\u201348}} Loy tested for the role, which went to [[Gertrude Olmstead]] instead, but soon after she was hired as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]] for ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' (1925), in which she and fellow newcomer [[Joan Crawford]] were among a bevy of chorus girls dangling from an elaborate chandelier.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=37\u201341}}\n\nRambova hired Loy for a small but showy role opposite [[Nita Naldi]] in ''[[What Price Beauty?]]'', a film she was producing. Shot in May 1925, the film remained unreleased for three years; but [[Film still|stills]] of Loy in her exotic makeup and costume appeared in ''[[Motion Picture Magazine|Motion Picture]]'' magazine and led to a contract with [[Warner Bros.]] There, her surname was changed from Williams to Loy.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=42\u201343}}\n\nLoy's [[silent film]] roles were mainly as a vamp or ''[[femme fatale]]'', and she frequently portrayed characters of Asian or Eurasian background in films such as ''[[Across the Pacific (1926 film)|Across the Pacific]]'' (1926), ''[[A Girl in Every Port (1928 film)|A Girl in Every Port]]'' (1928), ''[[The Crimson City]]'' (1928), ''[[The Black Watch]]'' (1929), and ''[[The Desert Song (1929 film)|The Desert Song]]'' (1929), which she later recalled \"kind of solidified my exotic non-American image.\"{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|p=66}} In 1930 she appeared in ''[[The Great Divide (1929 film)|The Great Divide]]''. It took years for her to overcome this stereotype, and as late as 1932, she was cast as a villainous Eurasian in ''[[Thirteen Women]]'' (1932). She also played, opposite [[Boris Karloff]], the depraved sadistic daughter of the title character in ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]'' (1932).\n\nIn 1932, Loy began dating producer [[Arthur Hornblow Jr.]], when he was still married to his wife, Juliette Crosby.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=92}} \nPrior to that, Loy appeared in small roles in ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' and a number of early lavish [[Technicolor]] musicals, including ''[[The Show of Shows]]'', ''[[The Bride of the Regiment]]'', and ''[[Under a Texas Moon (film)|Under a Texas Moon]]''. As a result, she became associated with musical roles, and when they began to lose favor with the public, her career went into a slump. In 1934, Loy appeared in ''[[Manhattan Melodrama]]'' with [[Clark Gable]] and [[William Powell]]. When gangster [[John Dillinger]] was shot to death after leaving a screening of the film at the [[Biograph Theater]] in Chicago, the film received widespread publicity, with some newspapers reporting that Loy had been Dillinger's favorite actress.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|p=97}}\n\n===1933\u20131938: Rise to stardom===\n[[File:Thin-Man-Loy-Powell-Skippy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Loy, [[William Powell]] and [[Skippy (dog)|Asta]] in ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'' (1934)]]\nAfter appearing with [[Ram\u00f3n Novarro]] in ''[[The Barbarian (1933 film)|The Barbarian]]'' (1933), Loy was cast as [[Nick and Nora Charles|Nora Charles]] in the 1934 film ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]''. Director [[W. S. Van Dyke]] chose Loy after he detected a wit and sense of humor that her previous films had not revealed. At a Hollywood party, he pushed her into a swimming pool to test her reaction, and felt that her aplomb in handling the situation was exactly what he envisioned for Nora.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|p=88}} [[Louis B. Mayer]] at first refused to allow Loy to play the part because he felt she was a dramatic actress, but Van Dyke insisted. Mayer finally relented on the condition that filming be completed within three weeks, as Loy was committed to start filming ''[[Stamboul Quest]]''.{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=88\u201389}} ''The Thin Man'' became one of the year's biggest hits, and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Loy received excellent reviews and was acclaimed for her comedic skills. Her costar [[William Powell]] and she proved to be a popular screen couple and appeared in 14 films together, [[William Powell and Myrna Loy|one of the most prolific pairings]] in [[Hollywood]] history. Loy later referred to ''The Thin Man'' as the film \"that finally made me ... after more than 80 films.\"{{sfn|Kotsilibas-Davis|Loy|1987|pages=88\u201391}}\n[[File:Hornblow-Loy-1936.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Hornblow Jr.]] and Loy soon after their marriage in 1936]]\n\nHer successes in ''Manhattan Melodrama'' and ''The Thin Man'' marked a turning point in her career, and she was cast in more important pictures. Such films as ''[[Wife vs. Secretary]]'' (1936) with Clark Gable and [[Jean Harlow]], and ''[[Petticoat Fever]]'' (1936) with [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] gave her opportunity to develop comedic skills. She made four films in close succession with William Powell: ''[[Libeled Lady]]'' (1936), which also starred Jean Harlow and [[Spencer Tracy]]; ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' (1936), in which she played [[Billie Burke]] opposite Powell's [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]; the second Thin Man film, ''[[After the Thin Man]]'' (1936), with Powell and [[James Stewart]]; and the romantic comedy ''[[Double Wedding]]'' (1937). Loy married Arthur Hornblow in 1936 in-between filming the successive productions.{{sfn|Leider|2011|p=149}} She was later rumored to have had affairs with co-star Tracy between 1935 and 1936 while filming ''[[Whipsaw (film)|Whipsaw]]'' and ''[[Libeled Lady]]''.{{sfn|Wayne|2005|pages=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Andersen|1997|p=86}}\n[[File:Clark Gable and Myrna Loy on set of Too Hot to Handle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Loy with [[Clark Gable]] on the set of ''[[Too Hot to Handle (1938 film)|Too Hot to Handle]]'', 1938]]\nShe also made three more films with Gable at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM): ''[[Parnell (film)|Parnell]]'' (1937) was a historical drama and one of the most poorly received films of either Loy's or Gable's career, but their other pairings in ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]'' and ''[[Too Hot to Handle (1938 film)|Too Hot to Handle]]'' (both 1938) were successes. While working for MGM, Loy was outspoken about the studio's casting hierarchy, especially based on [[race (human categorization)|race]], and was quoted as saying: \"Why does every black person in the movies have to play a servant? How about a black person walking up the steps of a court house carrying a briefcase?\"{{sfn|Maier|2011|p=17}}\n\nDuring this period, Loy was one of Hollywood's busiest and highest-paid actresses, and in 1937 and 1938, she was listed in the annual \"Quigley Poll of the Top Ten Money Making Stars,\" which was compiled from the votes of movie exhibitors throughout the United States for the stars who had generated the most revenue in their theaters over the previous year.<ref>[http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html \"The 2007 Motion Picture Almanac, Top Ten Money Making Stars\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221063625/http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |date=December 21, 2014 }},  quigleypublishing.com; retrieved July 11, 2007.</ref>\n\n===1939\u20131949: Mainstream work and war activism===\n[[File:Rains-Came-Loy-Power.jpg|left|thumb|Loy and [[Tyrone Power]] in ''[[The Rains Came]]'' (1939)]]\nBy the late 1930s, Loy was highly regarded for her performances in romantic comedies, and she was anxious to demonstrate her dramatic ability.
