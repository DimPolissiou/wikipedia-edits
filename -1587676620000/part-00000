Even if the same breeds are used for pollinators and fruit bearing plants, there is no guarantee that the fruit will have the same quality as the parent. Additionally, [[seedling]]s take seven years before they flower, so determining whether the kiwi is fruit bearing or a pollinator is time-consuming.<ref name=\"ucd\">{{cite web |url=http://fruitandnuteducation.ucdavis.edu/education/fruitnutproduction/Kiwi/Kiwi_Propagation/ |title=Kiwifruit Propagation |publisher=University of California-Davis, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources|date=2015|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref> Therefore, most kiwifruits, with the exception of rootstock and new [[cultivar]]s, are propagated [[asexual reproduction|asexually]].<ref name=\"ucd\" /> This is done by grafting the fruit producing plant onto rootstock grown from seedlings or, if the plant is desired to be a true cultivar, rootstock grown from cuttings of a mature plant.<ref name=\"ucd\" />\n\n===Pollination===\n[[File:Kiwifruit Female Flowers.JPG|thumb|Kiwifruit flowering]]\nKiwifruit plants generally are [[dioecious]], meaning a plant is either male or female. The male plants have flowers that produce pollen, the females receive the pollen to fertilise their ovules and grow fruit; most kiwifruit requires a male plant to [[pollinate]] the female plant. For a good yield of fruit, one male vine for every three to eight female vines is considered adequate.<ref name=Morton /> Some varieties can self pollinate, but even they produce a greater and more reliable yield when pollinated by male kiwifruit.<ref name=Morton /> Cross-species pollination is often (but not always) successful as long as bloom times are synchronised.\n\nIn nature, the species are pollinated by birds and native bumblebees, which visit the flowers for pollen, not nectar. The female flowers produce fake anthers with what appears to be pollen on the tips in order to attract the pollinators, although these fake anthers lack the DNA and food value of the male anthers.<ref name=\"Kiwifruit pollination problems\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/72-kiwifruit-pollination-problems|title=Kiwifruit pollination problems|website=Science Learning Hub}}</ref>\n\nKiwifruit growers rely on [[honey bees]], the principal \u2018for-hire\u2019 pollinator. But commercially grown kiwifruit is notoriously difficult to pollinate. The flowers are not very attractive to honey bees, in part because the flowers do not produce nectar and bees quickly learn to prefer flowers with nectar.\n\nAnd for kiwifruit, honey bees are inefficient cross-pollinators because they practice \u201cfloral fidelity\u201d. Each honey bee visits only a single type of flower in any foray and maybe only a few branches of a single plant. The pollen needed from a different plant (such as a male for a female kiwifruit) might never reach it were it not for the cross-pollination that principally occurs in the crowded colony. It is in the colonies where bees laden with different pollen literally cross paths.<ref>https://honeybeesuite.com/how-bees-transfer-pollen-between-flowers/ Honey Bee Suite</ref>\n\nTo deal with these pollination challenges, some producers blow collected pollen over the female flowers.<ref name=\"Kiwifruit pollination problems\"/> Most common, though, is [[saturation pollination]], where the honey bee populations are made so large (by placing hives in the orchards at a concentration of about 8 hives per hectare) that bees are forced to use this flower because of intense competition for all flowers within flight distance.<ref name=Morton />\n\n===Maturation and harvest===\nKiwifruit is picked by hand and commercially grown on sturdy support structures, as it can produce several tonnes per hectare, more than the rather weak vines can support. These are generally equipped with a watering system for irrigation and frost protection in the spring.\n\nKiwifruit vines require vigorous pruning, similar to that of grapevines. Fruit is borne on one-year-old and older canes, but production declines as each cane ages. Canes should be pruned off and replaced after their third year. In the northern hemisphere the fruit ripens in November, while in the southern it ripens in May. Four year-old plants can produce up to 14,000 lbs per acre while eight year-old plants can produce 18,000 lbs per acre. The plants produce their maximum at 8 to 10 years old. The seasonal yields are variable, a heavy crop on a vine one season generally comes with a light crop the following season.<ref name=Morton />\n\n===Storage===\nFruits harvested when firm will ripen when stored properly for long periods. This allows fruit to be sent to market up to 8 weeks after harvest.<ref name=Morton />\n\nFirm kiwifruit ripen after a few days to a week when stored at room temperature, but should not be kept in direct sunlight. Faster ripening occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, pear, or banana.<ref name=ukfoodguide>{{cite web|title=Kiwi fruit|url=http://www.ukfoodguide.net/kiwifruit.htm|publisher=The UK Food Guide|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref> Once a kiwifruit is ripe, however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is very sensitive to the [[ethylene]] gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even in the refrigerator.<ref name=ukfoodguide /> If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit normally keep for about one to two weeks.<ref name=ukfoodguide />\n\n===Pests and diseases===\n''[[Pseudomonas syringae]] actinidiae'' (PSA) was first identified in Japan in the 1980s.

Even if the same breeds are used for pollinators and fruit bearing plants, there is no guarantee that the fruit will have the same quality as the parent. Additionally, [[seedling]]s take seven years before they flower, so determining whether the kiwi is fruit bearing or a pollinator is time-consuming.<ref name=\"ucd\">{{cite web |url=http://fruitandnuteducation.ucdavis.edu/education/fruitnutproduction/Kiwi/Kiwi_Propagation/ |title=Kiwifruit Propagation |publisher=University of California-Davis, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources|date=2015|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref> Therefore, most kiwifruits, with the exception of rootstock and new [[cultivar]]s, are propagated [[asexual reproduction|asexually]].<ref name=\"ucd\" /> This is done by grafting the fruit producing plant onto rootstock grown from seedlings or, if the plant is desired to be a true cultivar, rootstock grown from cuttings of a mature plant.<ref name=\"ucd\" />\n\n===Pollination===\n[[File:Kiwifruit Female Flowers.JPG|thumb|Kiwifruit flowering]]\nKiwifruit plants generally are [[dioecious]], meaning a plant is either male or female. The male plants have flowers that produce pollen, the females receive the pollen to fertilise their ovules and grow fruit; most kiwifruit requires a male plant to [[pollinate]] the female plant. For a good yield of fruit, one male vine for every three to eight female vines is considered adequate.<ref name=Morton /> Some varieties can self pollinate, but even they produce a greater and more reliable yield when pollinated by male kiwifruit.<ref name=Morton /> Cross-species pollination is often (but not always) successful as long as bloom times are synchronised.\n\nIn nature, the species are pollinated by birds and native bumblebees, which visit the flowers for pollen, not nectar. The female flowers produce fake anthers with what appears to be pollen on the tips in order to attract the pollinators, although these fake anthers lack the DNA and food value of the male anthers.<ref name=\"Kiwifruit pollination problems\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/72-kiwifruit-pollination-problems|title=Kiwifruit pollination problems|website=Science Learning Hub}}</ref>\n\nKiwifruit growers rely on [[honey bees]], the principal \u2018for-hire\u2019 pollinator. But commercially grown kiwifruit is notoriously difficult to pollinate. The flowers are not very attractive to honey bees, in part because the flowers do not produce nectar and bees quickly learn to prefer flowers with nectar.\n\nAnd for kiwifruit, honey bees are inefficient cross-pollinators because they practice \u201cfloral fidelity\u201d. Each honey bee visits only a single type of flower in any foray and maybe only a few branches of a single plant. The pollen needed from a different plant (such as a male for a female kiwifruit) might never reach it were it not for the cross-pollination that principally occurs in the crowded colony. It is in the colonies where bees laden with different pollen literally cross paths.<ref>https://honeybeesuite.com/how-bees-transfer-pollen-between-flowers/ Honey Bee Suite</ref>\n\nTo deal with these pollination challenges, some producers blow collected pollen over the female flowers.<ref name=\"Kiwifruit pollination problems\"/> Most common, though, is [[saturation pollination]], where the honey bee populations are made so large (by placing hives in the orchards at a concentration of about 8 hives per hectare) that bees are forced to use this flower because of intense competition for all flowers within flight distance.<ref name=Morton />\n\n===Maturation and harvest===\nKiwifruit is picked by hand and commercially grown on sturdy support structures, as it can produce several tonnes per hectare, more than the rather weak vines can support. These are generally equipped with a watering system for irrigation and frost protection in the spring.\n\nKiwifruit vines require vigorous pruning, similar to that of grapevines. Fruit is borne on one-year-old and older canes, but production declines as each cane ages. Canes should be pruned off and replaced after their third year. In the northern hemisphere the fruit ripens in November, while in the southern it ripens in May. Four year-old plants can produce up to 14,000 lbs per acre while eight year-old plants can produce 18,000 lbs per acre. The plants produce their maximum at 8 to 10 years old. The seasonal yields are variable, a heavy crop on a vine one season generally comes with a light crop the following season.<ref name=Morton />\n\n===Storage===\nFruits harvested when firm will ripen when stored properly for long periods. This allows fruit to be sent to market up to 8 weeks after harvest.<ref name=Morton />\n\nFirm kiwifruit ripen after a few days to a week when stored at room temperature, but should not be kept in direct sunlight. Faster ripening occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, pear, or banana.<ref name=ukfoodguide>{{cite web|title=Kiwi fruit|url=http://www.ukfoodguide.net/kiwifruit.htm|publisher=The UK Food Guide|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref> Once a kiwifruit is ripe, however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is very sensitive to the [[ethylene]] gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even in the refrigerator.<ref name=ukfoodguide /> If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit normally keep for about one to two weeks.<ref name=ukfoodguide />\n\n===Pests and diseases===\n''[[Pseudomonas syringae]] actinidiae'' (PSA) was first identified in Japan in the 1980s.

The novel was published on October 7, 2009 by [[Delacorte Press]], an imprint of [[Random House]], and was made into a [[The Maze Runner (film)|2014 major motion picture]] by [[20th Century Fox]].\n\n==Butt==\nThomas wakes up in a metal elevator that brings him to a place called ''the Glade''. He has no memory of who he is or how he got there. He gradually discovers that the Glade is run by two boys: Alby, the leader, and Newt, the second-in-charge, who both maintain order by enforcing simple but effective rules. The elevator box surfaces from under the ground once every week supplying new food, tools, medicine, and sometimes weapons. Every month a new boy with no memory of anything but his first name finds himself in that elevator box. The Glade is surrounded by a square of 4&nbsp;mile-high walls made of concrete. These walls have openings in them, which slide shut like doors every night. Outside the walls is the Maze, a labyrinth of high concrete walls covered in ivy that changes every day. The Maze houses strange, lethal creatures known as Grievers. Grievers are described as amorphous monsters of metal and flesh. The Gladers are trying to stay alive as well as \"solve\" the Maze by appointing 'runners' to run through it as fast as they can while tracking movements of the walls and trying to find an exit to escape.\n\nOne day after Thomas' arrival, a girl named Teresa is delivered through the elevator into the Glade with a note saying \"She's the last one. Ever.\" It implies that there will be no more children sent into the Glade. The girl subsequently lapses into a long \ncoma. When Thomas comes to visit her, he recognizes her, but cannot remember her name until he hears her voice telepathically in his mind telling him her name. Teresa wakes up and tells Thomas that they knew each other before they were sent into the Glade, and reveals that they could communicate telepathically.\n\nMinho, the keeper of the runners, and Alby go into the Maze to see what they think is their first dead Griever. Alby is stung by the creature and, while Minho is trying to help him out of the Maze, Thomas runs in to help. All three are then stranded in the Maze overnight. Minho, believing Alby is dead without the Serum, tells Thomas to leave him and just run, looking for shelter so the Grievers don't find them. Thomas, unable to leave Alby to die, uses the vines on the walls to pull him up and out of the view of the Grievers, then attracts their attention and evades them. Minho sees Thomas's evasion tactic and uses it to send the four Grievers chasing them over the Cliff. Thomas, Alby, and Minho are the first people in the Glade to survive a night in the maze. After getting back to The Glade the next morning, Newt calls a Gathering of The Keepers to discuss what to do with Thomas. Some of the Keepers vote to relieve him of punishment while others (especially Gally) vote to lock him up in the Slammer (the jail block) as a punishment. Minho, however, nominates Thomas to replace him as the Keeper of The Runners. Gally decides to kick Minho off The Council, causing Minho to attack him. Thomas is locked up in jail and the next day he starts his training with Minho. \n\nAfter their miraculous return, Teresa's arrival triggers a series of changes to life in the Glade: people start acting strangely, the sun disappears, the weekly deliveries of supplies stop coming, and the doors of the Maze stay open at night, which allows the Grievers to enter the Glade and hunt the children. \n\nThomas proposes that the walls of the Maze are not random, but that their movements are actually a code, leading to the discovery that the Maze is spelling out words. Thomas also discovers that what they previously thought was the Cliff is actually where the Grievers leave the Maze (\"The Griever Hole\"). This drives Thomas to think they need memories to get out, so he intentionally gets stung by a Griever so he can receive the antidote (\"Grief Serum\") and thereby go through ''the Changing''. It is known that the Changing can trigger memories and sometimes violence.\n\nThomas and the Gladers find out what the pattern is. The Gladers to decide to make a run for the exit, knowing that taking on the Grievers is a suicide mission, but deciding that nothing is worse than their current fate. They succeed, only to find out that they were test subjects in an experiment conducted by an organization called ''World In Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department'' (WICKED). The teenagers escape to a laboratory but encounter Gally, who had not escaped with them. Acting under mind control, he moves to throw a knife at Thomas, but a young Glader, Chuck, jumps to save him.\n\nAfter briefly mourning the death of Chuck, all 20 Gladers are rescued. They are brought to a safe haven and told about catastrophic [[solar flare]]s that caused an apocalyptic event, followed by a virus called ''the Flare'' that killed millions. The rescuers reveal that orphaned children are being tested to find a cure for the virus.\n\n;Epilogue\nThe epilogue is [[Omniscient narrator|written in the voice of]] Chancellor Ava Paige\u2014a feature of all the novels in the trilogy. She reveals that the group who rescued the Gladers may just be another variable in the experiment and that the Gladers weren't the only group being evaluated.\n\n==Characters==\n; '''Thomas''': The [[protagonist]]. Thomas is the last boy, but not the last person to enter the Glade. The only thing he remembered when he came into the glade was his name. Chuck described him as about 16 years old, of average height, and brown-haired. He was called \"Greenie\", a nickname given to new arrivals. He becomes a Runner with Minho after being the first person to spend a whole night in the Maze and saves Alby when he is about to die. He has a telepathic connection with Teresa and was able to talk to her while she was in a coma.\n; '''Teresa''': One of the main protagonists. The first girl and last person to enter the Glade. When she entered the Glade she was in a [[coma]] and Newt thought she was dead. She also calls Thomas \"Tom\". She has a telepathic connection with Thomas. She is also known to help Thomas out of the maze and fight the Grievers in the Griever Hole. She is thin, has black hair and blue eyes, and relatively pale skin.\n; '''Alby''': The eldest and the leader of the Gladers. He is described as 'The dark-skinned boy with short-cropped hair, his face clean-shaven'. He tries to keep order within the group by having all the boys follow the rules they've set down to survive. He has a very close relationship with Newt, his second-in-command. He was in the group of 30 people who first arrived in the Glade. Alby commits suicide by walking into a group of Grievers, thinking that it was better that he die there than outside the Maze.\n; '''Newt''': One of the main protagonists and is good friends with Thomas and Minho. He used to be a Runner but is no longer able-footed. He is very kind, friendly, and welcoming to Thomas. He is Alby's closest friend and second-in-command and takes over as leader when Alby no longer feels capable.\n;'''Minho''': One of the main protagonists and is the Keeper of the Runners. He is in charge of navigating and mapping out the Maze. As a Runner, he's in very good shape and is described as \"an Asian kid with strong, heavily-muscled arms and short black hair.\" He is sarcastic and a jokester. He tends to react without thinking, which leads himself into trouble. He and Thomas quickly become good friends. \n; '''Chuck''': A young and chubby boy with curly hair who was the newest Glader until Thomas arrived. He immediately becomes friends with Thomas and acts like a little brother towards him. Chuck was a \"Slopper\". He is around 12 or 13&nbsp; years old. He is killed by Gally after a knife is thrown at him while he is saving Thomas (shot in the movie).\n; '''Gally''': The main antagonist. A Glader who lives by the rules Alby put in place. He does not trust Thomas and shows an immense dislike for him. He is also the Keeper of the Builders. He runs away from the Glade in a fit of rage after exclaiming that he thought \"Thomas was not to be trusted\" in the Gathering. At the end of the book, he kills Chuck by throwing a knife into his chest. (shot with a gun in the movie)\n; '''Ben''': A Runner. After undergoing the Changing and attempting to kill Thomas. Ben is banished to the Maze while still induced with the serum and still psycho and dies overnight.\n; '''Ava Paige''': The Chancellor of WICKED and the person responsible for sending teenagers into the Maze. She appears in the Epilogue as an e-mail.\n; '''Grievers''': Mechanical creatures that haunt and kill the Gladers in the maze.

The novel was published on October 7, 2009 by [[Delacorte Press]], an imprint of [[Random House]], and was made into a [[The Maze Runner (film)|2014 major motion picture]] by [[20th Century Fox]].\n\n==Plot==\nThomas wakes up in a metal elevator that brings him to a place called ''the Glade''. He has no memory of who he is or how he got there. He gradually discovers that the Glade is run by two boys: Alby, the leader, and Newt, the second-in-charge, who both maintain order by enforcing simple but effective rules. The elevator box surfaces from under the ground once every week supplying new food, tools, medicine, and sometimes weapons. Every month a new boy with no memory of anything but his first name finds himself in that elevator box. The Glade is surrounded by a square of 4&nbsp;mile-high walls made of concrete. These walls have openings in them, which slide shut like doors every night. Outside the walls is the Maze, a labyrinth of high concrete walls covered in ivy that changes every day. The Maze houses strange, lethal creatures known as Grievers. Grievers are described as amorphous monsters of metal and flesh. The Gladers are trying to stay alive as well as \"solve\" the Maze by appointing 'runners' to run through it as fast as they can while tracking movements of the walls and trying to find an exit to escape.\n\nOne day after Thomas' arrival, a girl named Teresa is delivered through the elevator into the Glade with a note saying \"She's the last one. Ever.\" It implies that there will be no more children sent into the Glade. The girl subsequently lapses into a long \ncoma. When Thomas comes to visit her, he recognizes her, but cannot remember her name until he hears her voice telepathically in his mind telling him her name. Teresa wakes up and tells Thomas that they knew each other before they were sent into the Glade, and reveals that they could communicate telepathically.\n\nMinho, the keeper of the runners, and Alby go into the Maze to see what they think is their first dead Griever. Alby is stung by the creature and, while Minho is trying to help him out of the Maze, Thomas runs in to help. All three are then stranded in the Maze overnight. Minho, believing Alby is dead without the Serum, tells Thomas to leave him and just run, looking for shelter so the Grievers don't find them. Thomas, unable to leave Alby to die, uses the vines on the walls to pull him up and out of the view of the Grievers, then attracts their attention and evades them. Minho sees Thomas's evasion tactic and uses it to send the four Grievers chasing them over the Cliff. Thomas, Alby, and Minho are the first people in the Glade to survive a night in the maze. After getting back to The Glade the next morning, Newt calls a Gathering of The Keepers to discuss what to do with Thomas. Some of the Keepers vote to relieve him of punishment while others (especially Gally) vote to lock him up in the Slammer (the jail block) as a punishment. Minho, however, nominates Thomas to replace him as the Keeper of The Runners. Gally decides to kick Minho off The Council, causing Minho to attack him. Thomas is locked up in jail and the next day he starts his training with Minho. \n\nAfter their miraculous return, Teresa's arrival triggers a series of changes to life in the Glade: people start acting strangely, the sun disappears, the weekly deliveries of supplies stop coming, and the doors of the Maze stay open at night, which allows the Grievers to enter the Glade and hunt the children. \n\nThomas proposes that the walls of the Maze are not random, but that their movements are actually a code, leading to the discovery that the Maze is spelling out words. Thomas also discovers that what they previously thought was the Cliff is actually where the Grievers leave the Maze (\"The Griever Hole\"). This drives Thomas to think they need memories to get out, so he intentionally gets stung by a Griever so he can receive the antidote (\"Grief Serum\") and thereby go through ''the Changing''. It is known that the Changing can trigger memories and sometimes violence.\n\nThomas and the Gladers find out what the pattern is. The Gladers to decide to make a run for the exit, knowing that taking on the Grievers is a suicide mission, but deciding that nothing is worse than their current fate. They succeed, only to find out that they were test subjects in an experiment conducted by an organization called ''World In Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department'' (WICKED). The teenagers escape to a laboratory but encounter Gally, who had not escaped with them. Acting under mind control, he moves to throw a knife at Thomas, but a young Glader, Chuck, jumps to save him.\n\nAfter briefly mourning the death of Chuck, all 20 Gladers are rescued. They are brought to a safe haven and told about catastrophic [[solar flare]]s that caused an apocalyptic event, followed by a virus called ''the Flare'' that killed millions. The rescuers reveal that orphaned children are being tested to find a cure for the virus.\n\n;Epilogue\nThe epilogue is [[Omniscient narrator|written in the voice of]] Chancellor Ava Paige\u2014a feature of all the novels in the trilogy. She reveals that the group who rescued the Gladers may just be another variable in the experiment and that the Gladers weren't the only group being evaluated.\n\n==Characters==\n; '''Thomas''': The [[protagonist]]. Thomas is the last boy, but not the last person to enter the Glade. The only thing he remembered when he came into the glade was his name. Chuck described him as about 16 years old, of average height, and brown-haired. He was called \"Greenie\", a nickname given to new arrivals. He becomes a Runner with Minho after being the first person to spend a whole night in the Maze and saves Alby when he is about to die. He has a telepathic connection with Teresa and was able to talk to her while she was in a coma.\n; '''Teresa''': One of the main protagonists. The first girl and last person to enter the Glade. When she entered the Glade she was in a [[coma]] and Newt thought she was dead. She also calls Thomas \"Tom\". She has a telepathic connection with Thomas. She is also known to help Thomas out of the maze and fight the Grievers in the Griever Hole. She is thin, has black hair and blue eyes, and relatively pale skin.\n; '''Alby''': The eldest and the leader of the Gladers. He is described as 'The dark-skinned boy with short-cropped hair, his face clean-shaven'. He tries to keep order within the group by having all the boys follow the rules they've set down to survive. He has a very close relationship with Newt, his second-in-command. He was in the group of 30 people who first arrived in the Glade. Alby commits suicide by walking into a group of Grievers, thinking that it was better that he die there than outside the Maze.\n; '''Newt''': One of the main protagonists and is good friends with Thomas and Minho. He used to be a Runner but is no longer able-footed. He is very kind, friendly, and welcoming to Thomas. He is Alby's closest friend and second-in-command and takes over as leader when Alby no longer feels capable.\n;'''Minho''': One of the main protagonists and is the Keeper of the Runners. He is in charge of navigating and mapping out the Maze. As a Runner, he's in very good shape and is described as \"an Asian kid with strong, heavily-muscled arms and short black hair.\" He is sarcastic and a jokester. He tends to react without thinking, which leads himself into trouble. He and Thomas quickly become good friends. \n; '''Chuck''': A young and chubby boy with curly hair who was the newest Glader until Thomas arrived. He immediately becomes friends with Thomas and acts like a little brother towards him. Chuck was a \"Slopper\". He is around 12 or 13&nbsp; years old. He is killed by Gally after a knife is thrown at him while he is saving Thomas (shot in the movie).\n; '''Gally''': The main antagonist. A Glader who lives by the rules Alby put in place. He does not trust Thomas and shows an immense dislike for him. He is also the Keeper of the Builders. He runs away from the Glade in a fit of rage after exclaiming that he thought \"Thomas was not to be trusted\" in the Gathering. At the end of the book, he kills Chuck by throwing a knife into his chest. (shot with a gun in the movie)\n; '''Ben''': A Runner. After undergoing the Changing and attempting to kill Thomas. Ben is banished to the Maze while still induced with the serum and still psycho and dies overnight.\n; '''Ava Paige''': The Chancellor of WICKED and the person responsible for sending teenagers into the Maze. She appears in the Epilogue as an e-mail.\n; '''Grievers''': Mechanical creatures that haunt and kill the Gladers in the maze. In \"The Ending\" they are let free onto the Glade to kill one person every day.\n\n==Development==\nIn late 2005, Dashner had published four books to complete ''The Jimmy Fincher Saga'', which had been with a small regional publisher.

In 2007, the summer school began being hosted by the [[University of Vermont]] at Burlington, with the exception of the year 2009 which was held at the Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione of the CNR in [[Pisa, Italy]]. In 2012, the program was held at [[Curry College]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. Since 2013, the Wolfram Summer School has been held annually at [[Bentley University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]].\n\nIn [[A New Kind of Science]] is the idea of exploring a new abstract universe: a computational universe of simple programs. In A New Kind of Science, Wolfram shows how simple programs in his computational universe capture the essence of the complexity \u2013 and beauty \u2013 of many systems in nature. This led to the creation of [http://tones.wolfram.com/generate/GItzk3t42uLRvdFUbg2T2fHV6QR1yuZZXpcGb6FrHqdTcm/ Wolfram Tones] which works by taking simple programs from Wolfram's computational universe, applying music theory, and [[Wolfram Language]] algorithms to render them as music. Each program in effect defines a virtual world, with its own special story&nbsp;\u2014 and Wolfram Tones captures it as a musical composition.\n\nIn [[A New Kind of Science]], Wolfram found what was then the simplest known universal Turing machine&nbsp;\u2014 with 2 states and 5 colors. However, he also did an extensive search of simpler Turing machines and in doing that, found a much simpler candidate for universality, a [[Wolfram's 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine|2,3 Turing machine]]. On 14 May 2007, (the fifth anniversary of the publication of ''A New Kind of Science''), Wolfram announced a $25,000 prize for the first person to determine whether or not the 2,3 Turing machine was actually universal or not, and could provide proof. Five months after the contest's announcement, an undergraduate student from Birmingham, UK, successfully found the 2,3 Turing machine to be universal and provided a 40-page paper<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/TM23Proof.pdf |title=TM23Proof |access-date=23 April 2020 }}</ref> to prove his findings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2007/10/college-kid-pro|title=College Kid Proves That Wolfram's Turing Machine is the Simplest Universal Computer |accessdate=23 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\n=== Wolfram Alpha computational knowledge engine ===\n{{Main|Wolfram Alpha}}\n\nIn March 2009, Wolfram announced Wolfram|Alpha, an [[answer engine]].

Additionally, it argues that for fundamental reasons these types of systems, rather than traditional mathematics, are needed to model and understand complexity in nature.

He predicts that a realization of this within the scientific communities will have a major and revolutionary influence on physics, chemistry and biology and the majority of the scientific areas in general, which is the reason for the book's title.\n\nSince the release of the book in 2002,<ref name=\"scopus\">{{Scopus|id=16493873100}}</ref> Wolfram has split his time between developing ''Mathematica'' and encouraging people to get involved with the subject matter of ''A New Kind of Science'' by giving talks, holding conferences, and starting a summer school devoted to the topic.<ref name=\"ted\">TED (2010): ''Stephen Wolfram: Scientist, Inventor.''

In 2007, the summer school began being hosted by the [[University of Vermont]] at Burlington, with the exception of the year 2009 which was held at the Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione of the CNR in [[Pisa, Italy]]. In 2012, the program was held at [[Curry College]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. Since 2013, the Wolfram Summer School has been held annually at [[Bentley University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]].\n\nIn [[A New Kind of Science]] is the idea of exploring a new abstract universe: a computational universe of simple programs. In A New Kind of Science, Wolfram shows how simple programs in his computational universe capture the essence of the complexity \u2013 and beauty \u2013 of many systems in nature. This led to the creation of [http://tones.wolfram.com/generate/GItzk3t42uLRvdFUbg2T2fHV6QR1yuZZXpcGb6FrHqdTcm/ Wolfram Tones] which works by taking simple programs from Wolfram's computational universe, applying music theory, and [[Wolfram Language]] algorithms to render them as music. Each program in effect defines a virtual world, with its own special story&nbsp;\u2014 and Wolfram Tones captures it as a musical composition.\n\nIn [[A New Kind of Science]], Wolfram found what was then the simplest known universal Turing machine&nbsp;\u2014 with 2 states and 5 colors. However, he also did an extensive search of simpler Turing machines and in doing that, found a much simpler candidate for universality, a [[Wolfram's 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine|2,3 Turing machine]]. On 14 May 2007, (the fifth anniversary of the publication of ''A New Kind of Science''), Wolfram announced a $25,000 prize for the first person to determine whether or not the 2,3 Turing machine was actually universal or not, and could provide proof. Five months after the contest's announcement, an undergraduate student from Birmingham, UK, successfully found the 2,3 Turing machine to be universal and provided a 40-page paper<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/TM23Proof.pdf |title=TM23Proof |access-date=23 April 2020 }}</ref> to prove his findings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2007/10/college-kid-pro|title=College Kid Proves That Wolfram's Turing Machine is the Simplest Universal Computer |accessdate=23 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\n=== Wolfram Alpha computational knowledge engine ===\n{{Main|Wolfram Alpha}}\n\nIn March 2009, Wolfram announced Wolfram|Alpha, an [[answer engine]].

Kilmarnock initially defeated [[Hurlford F.C.|Hurlford]] 6\u20131 at Drumbiehill Park but a protest over a breach of registration rules was upheld and the result was declared void. The match was replayed and this time Hurlford won 3\u20131, however a similar protest by Kilmarnock was also upheld and Hurlford were disqualified from the competition. In the second round, ''Killie'' lost 4\u20131 to [[Annbank F.C.|Annbank]] at Pebble Park.\n\nA successful Ayrshire Cup campaign started with wins over [[Monkcastle F.C.|Monkcastle]] and [[Lugar Boswell Thistle F.C.|Lugar Boswell]] before Kilmarnock received a bye to the semi-finals. On 31 January 1885, Kilmarnock thumped [[Ayr F.C.|Ayr]] 5\u20132 at [[Rugby Park]] to reach the final for the second consecutive season. They retained the cup after defeating Hurlford 2\u20130 in the final at Holm Quarry.\n\nThe two charity cups saw similar fates for Kilmarnock.

Hurlford won through with a 5\u20131 victory in the fifth match on 14 November 1885.\n\nA third successive Ayrshire Cup triumph began with an 8\u20131 win over [[Maybole F.C.

In the second round, ''Killie'' lost 4\u20131 to [[Annbank F.C.|Annbank]] at Pebble Park.\n\nA successful Ayrshire Cup campaign started with wins over [[Monkcastle F.C.|Monkcastle]] and [[Lugar Boswell Thistle F.C.|Lugar Boswell]] before Kilmarnock received a bye to the semi-finals.

A club record 10\u20132 win was recorded against [[Lanemark F.C.|Lanemark]] in the second round and this was followed by a 7\u20132 win against [[Lugar Boswell Thistle F.C.|Lugar Boswell]] in the third round. A bye in the fourth round then saw Kilmarnock defeat [[Dunblane F.C.|Dunblane]] 6\u20130 in the fifth round before the journey came to an end in the quarter-finals with a 5\u20130 loss to [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]].\n\nThere was a similar start in the Ayrshire Cup when [[Girvan F.C.

They did reach the final of the Kilmarnock Merchants' Charity Cup but it was [[Ayr F.C.|Ayr]] who had their name on the trophy after the competition committee decided to play the final second replay at Beresford Park in [[Ayr]], the home of [[Ayr Parkhouse F.C.|Ayr Parkhouse]].
