Begun in 1997 as a small market of only 10 shops, the current market now has well over 3000. While most vendors provide the expected computer sales and repair services, it is also possible to find sales and repair services for various types of [[office equipment]] and electronic devices.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/metro/computer-village-what-you-probably-didnt-know-about-africas-biggest-gadget-market/2wytc4w|title=Computer Village: what you probably didn't know about Africa's biggest gadget market|last=|first=|date=|work=Pulse Nigeria|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAs the market is unplanned, it has experienced growing pains. Some local residents are upset at the expanding market. Traffic around the area has become very congested, and it can be almost impossible to find a place to park.\n\nAs at 2019, the little shops at Computer Village have grown to multiple storey shopping malls. Many of the single floor buildings have been developed into massive buildings, housing several shops that distribute and repair mobile phones, Laptops, Printers and other electronic devices. Nearly all the Major Banks in Nigeria have branches around the market.\n\nThe electrical [[infrastructure]], already overloaded and unreliable, has become highly stressed with the new market. Computer and electronics stores require power to work on computers and demonstrate their products to potential customers, and this added load has made the supply erratic.<ref>[http://www.nigeriabusinessinfo.com/computer-village2002.htm Focus on the Ikeja Computer Village, Lagos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920172802/http://www.nigeriabusinessinfo.com/computer-village2002.htm |date=20 September 2007 }}, NigeriaBusinessInfo.com, 2 September 2002.

Begun in 1997 as a small market of only 10 shops, the current market now has well over 3000.

Some local residents are upset at the expanding market. Traffic around the area has become very congested, and it can be almost impossible to find a place to park.\n\nAs at 2019, the little shops at Computer Village have grown to multiple storey shopping malls. Many of the single floor buildings have been developed into massive buildings, housing several shops that distribute and repair mobile phones, Laptops, Printers and other electronic devices. Nearly all the Major Banks in Nigeria have branches around the market.\n\nThe electrical [[infrastructure]], already overloaded and unreliable, has become highly stressed with the new market. Computer and electronics stores require power to work on computers and demonstrate their products to potential customers, and this added load has made the supply erratic.<ref>[http://www.nigeriabusinessinfo.com/computer-village2002.htm Focus on the Ikeja Computer Village, Lagos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920172802/http://www.nigeriabusinessinfo.com/computer-village2002.htm |date=20 September 2007 }}, NigeriaBusinessInfo.com, 2 September 2002.

Wycherley fronted his own group in 1955, but simultaneously worked full-time on a [[tugboat]] and later as a [[stevedore|docker]]. He entered and won a talent competition, and by 1958 had started composing his own songs.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nWycherley went to meet pop manager and [[impresario]] [[Larry Parnes]] at the Essoldo Theatre in [[Birkenhead]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2005/12/12/billyfury_book_feature.shtml |title=Liverpool \u2013 Entertainment \u2013 Billy Fury |publisher=BBC |date=1 October 1958 |accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref> hoping to interest one of Parnes' prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, well-known singer [[Marty Wilde]], in some of the songs he had written.

Fury confessed to the ''[[NME]]'' that \"I wanted people to think of me simply as a singer \u2013 and not, more specifically, as a rock singer. I'm growing up, and I want to broaden my scope.

The years 1961 through 1963 were Fury's best years chartwise. In 1962, he appeared in his first film, ''[[Play It Cool (film)|Play It Cool]]'', modelled on the [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] films.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> It featured [[Helen Shapiro]], [[Danny Williams (singer)|Danny Williams]], [[Alvin Stardust|Shane Fenton]] and [[Bobby Vee]], who appeared with [[the Vernons Girls]]. The hit single from the film was \"Once Upon a Dream\". There were other notable performances by several British actors and performers such as [[Richard Wattis]], [[Lionel Blair]] and [[Dennis Price]].\n\nFury's ''[[We Want Billy!]]'' (1963) was one of the first live albums in UK rock history, and featured renditions of his hits and [[cover version]]s of several [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] songs such as \"[[Unchain My Heart (song)|Unchain My Heart]]\".\n\nIn 1965 he appeared in the film ''[[I've Gotta Horse]]'',<ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\"/> which also featured his backing group the Gamblers, [[the Bachelors]], [[Amanda Barrie]], [[Michael Medwin]] and [[Jon Pertwee]]. The album from the film was made available in stereo. Fury left [[Decca Records]] in 1966, after signing to a five-year [[recording contract]] with [[Parlophone]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nHaving had more UK hits, such as \"[[It's Only Make Believe]]\" and \"[[I Will (Dick Glasser song)|I Will]]\" (written by [[Dick Glasser]], not to be confused with the [[Paul McCartney]] song), both in 1964, and \"In Thoughts of You\" (1965), Fury began a lengthy absence from the charts in 1967, and underwent surgery for heart problems in 1972 and 1976 which led to his abandoning touring.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\"/> Despite spending many weeks in the charts, Fury never achieved a number one single, but he remained popular even after his hits stopped. \"I Will\" became a US hit for [[Dean Martin]] (1965) and for [[Ruby Winters]] (1977).\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1973, Fury emerged from a period of semi-retirement to star as 'Stormy Tempest' in the film ''[[That'll Be the Day (film)|That'll Be the Day]]''.<ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\"/> Also starring [[David Essex]] and [[Ringo Starr]], it was roughly based on the early days of [[the Beatles]]. Starr was from the [[Dingle, Liverpool|Dingle]] area of Liverpool, as was Fury, and had originally played drums for [[Rory Storm|Rory Storm & the Hurricanes]], whom the Stormy Tempest group were said to be modelled on.\n\nIn the mid-1970s Fury went out on the road with Marty Wilde. Away from the spotlight, he focused on wildlife preservation.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Fury's health deteriorated and he underwent two open heart surgeries - the first was in 1972, and the second in 1976.<ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\"/> In 1978 he was declared bankrupt for unpaid taxes to the [[Inland Revenue]]. The taxes dated back to 1962, and amounted to \u00a316,780. Fury was also forced to sign over his royalties and publishing income. A new release, \"Be Mine Tonight\" (1981), failed to make an appearance in the UK Singles Chart. Worse was to follow in March 1981 when Fury, working on his own farm, collapsed and almost died. He returned to touring later that year, and his next two singles, \"Love or Money\" and \"Devil or Angel\", just dented the UK chart.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1981 and 1982, Fury was signed to [[Polydor Records]] by [[A&R]] man Frank Neilson, and recorded a comeback album, ''The One and Only'' (released posthumously) with [[Shakin' Stevens]]' producer [[Stuart Colman]]. Owing to his health, Fury did little touring to promote the new album. His last public appearance was at the Sunnyside pub, [[Northampton]], on 4 December 1982. A few days before he died, Fury recorded a live performance for the [[Channel 4]] television show, ''Unforgettable'', featuring six of his old hits,<ref>{{cite web|title=Final Days|url=http://www.billyfury.com/finaldays.htm|website=billyfury.com|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref> although, at the request of his mother, only four of them were broadcast.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Personal life==\nFury lived with [[Lee Everett Alkin|\"Lady Lee\" Middleton]] from 1959 to 1967.  During this time, he had a short relationship with actress [[Amanda Barrie]], his co-star in ''[[I've Gotta Horse]]''.\n\nHe married Judith Hall in May 1969, but later left her for [[Beneficiary|heiress]] Lisa Voice (n\u00e9e Rosen).

It was narrated by [[Ian Dury]]. Between 1999 and 2000 the song \"[[Wondrous Place]]\", a favourite of Fury's (he re-recorded it at least three times during his career), later received wide airplay on British television when it was used as the theme for a [[Toyota Yaris]] car advertisement. In 2005 [[Spencer Leigh (radio presenter)|Spencer Leigh]] from [[BBC Radio Merseyside]] published a biography book about Billy Fury called ''Wondrous Face \u2013 The Billy Fury Story.''

The singer's estate licensed the tracks to benefit his memorial fund, which finances equipment purchases for hospital heart units. In November 2011, further co-operation between the estate and Peaksoft resulted in the issuing of a second CD, ''The Lost Album'' (PEA014), which attempted to construct the format of an album recorded by Fury in 1967\u201371, but which was never released.\n\nFury's backing band from 1970 until 1976, when he stopped touring due to ill health, were Fury's Tornados, named by Fury and his then manager Hal Carter. They continue to tour in the theatre show \"Halfway to Paradise: The Billy Fury Story\". Fury is also remembered in the work of tribute bands such as another theatre show called \"The Billy Fury Years\".<ref>[https://www.dailypost.co.uk/whats-on/find-things-to-do/billy-fury-tribute-show-rhyl-2640624 \"North Wales Daily Post\".

[[The Puppets]] were another band that backed Fury at a couple of gigs for 12 months.\n\n==UK chart and film success==\nFury concentrated less on rock and roll and more on mainstream [[ballad]]s, such as \"[[Halfway to Paradise]]\" and \"[[Jalousie 'Tango Tzigane'|Jealousy]]\"<ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\"/> (which reached No. 3 and No. 2 respectively in the UK Singles Chart in 1961). Fury confessed to the ''[[NME]]'' that \"I wanted people to think of me simply as a singer \u2013 and not, more specifically, as a rock singer. I'm growing up, and I want to broaden my scope.

The years 1961 through 1963 were Fury's best years chartwise. In 1962, he appeared in his first film, ''[[Play It Cool (film)|Play It Cool]]'', modelled on the [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] films.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> It featured [[Helen Shapiro]], [[Danny Williams (singer)|Danny Williams]], [[Alvin Stardust|Shane Fenton]] and [[Bobby Vee]], who appeared with [[the Vernons Girls]]. The hit single from the film was \"Once Upon a Dream\". There were other notable performances by several British actors and performers such as [[Richard Wattis]], [[Lionel Blair]] and [[Dennis Price]].\n\nFury's ''[[We Want Billy!]]'' (1963) was one of the first live albums in UK rock history, and featured renditions of his hits and [[cover version]]s of several [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] songs such as \"[[Unchain My Heart (song)|Unchain My Heart]]\".\n\nIn 1965 he appeared in the film ''[[I've Gotta Horse]]'',<ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\"/> which also featured his backing group the Gamblers, [[the Bachelors]], [[Amanda Barrie]], [[Michael Medwin]] and [[Jon Pertwee]]. The album from the film was made available in stereo. Fury left [[Decca Records]] in 1966, after signing to a five-year [[recording contract]] with [[Parlophone]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nHaving had more UK hits, such as \"[[It's Only Make Believe]]\" and \"[[I Will (Dick Glasser song)|I Will]]\" (written by [[Dick Glasser]], not to be confused with the [[Paul McCartney]] song), both in 1964, and \"In Thoughts of You\" (1965), Fury began a lengthy absence from the charts in 1967, and underwent surgery for heart problems in 1972 and 1976 which led to his abandoning touring.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\"/> Despite spending many weeks in the charts, Fury never achieved a number one single, but he remained popular even after his hits stopped. \"I Will\" became a US hit for [[Dean Martin]] (1965) and for [[Ruby Winters]] (1977).\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1973, Fury emerged from a period of semi-retirement to star as 'Stormy Tempest' in the film ''[[That'll Be the Day (film)|That'll Be the Day]]''.<ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\"/> Also starring [[David Essex]] and [[Ringo Starr]], it was roughly based on the early days of [[the Beatles]]. Starr was from the [[Dingle, Liverpool|Dingle]] area of Liverpool, as was Fury, and had originally played drums for [[Rory Storm|Rory Storm & the Hurricanes]], whom the Stormy Tempest group were said to be modelled on.\n\nIn the mid-1970s Fury went out on the road with Marty Wilde. Away from the spotlight, he focused on wildlife preservation.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Fury's health deteriorated and he underwent two open heart surgeries - the first was in 1972, and the second in 1976.<ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\"/> In 1978 he was declared bankrupt for unpaid taxes to the [[Inland Revenue]]. The taxes dated back to 1962, and amounted to \u00a316,780. Fury was also forced to sign over his royalties and publishing income. A new release, \"Be Mine Tonight\" (1981), failed to make an appearance in the UK Singles Chart. Worse was to follow in March 1981 when Fury, working on his own farm, collapsed and almost died. He returned to touring later that year, and his next two singles, \"Love or Money\" and \"Devil or Angel\", just dented the UK chart.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn 1981 and 1982, Fury was signed to [[Polydor Records]] by [[A&R]] man Frank Neilson, and recorded a comeback album, ''The One and Only'' (released posthumously) with [[Shakin' Stevens]]' producer [[Stuart Colman]]. Owing to his health, Fury did little touring to promote the new album. His last public appearance was at the Sunnyside pub, [[Northampton]], on 4 December 1982. A few days before he died, Fury recorded a live performance for the [[Channel 4]] television show, ''Unforgettable'', featuring six of his old hits,<ref>{{cite web|title=Final Days|url=http://www.billyfury.com/finaldays.htm|website=billyfury.com|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref> although, at the request of his mother, only four of them were broadcast.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Personal life==\nFury lived with [[Lee Everett Alkin|\"Lady Lee\" Middleton]] from 1959 to 1967.  During this time, he had a short relationship with actress [[Amanda Barrie]], his co-star in ''[[I've Gotta Horse]]''.\n\nHe married Judith Hall in May 1969, but later left her for [[Beneficiary|heiress]] Lisa Voice (n\u00e9e Rosen). They lived together in London, and sometimes on Fury's farm in [[Wales]], from 1971 until his death, although they were leading separate lives for the last two years.<ref name=\"Billy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.billyfury.com/ |title=the story.

A song issued posthumously entitled \"Forget Him\" became his final chart hit.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Billy Fury statue Albert Dock Liverpool.jpg|right|thumb|Statue by Tom Murphy, [[Albert Dock, Liverpool]]]]\nOn 10 April 1983, a tribute concert for Billy was held at the [[Beck Theatre]] in [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]], [[Middlesex]].

It was narrated by [[Ian Dury]]. Between 1999 and 2000 the song \"[[Wondrous Place]]\", a favourite of Fury's (he re-recorded it at least three times during his career), later received wide airplay on British television when it was used as the theme for a [[Toyota Yaris]] car advertisement. In 2005 [[Spencer Leigh (radio presenter)|Spencer Leigh]] from [[BBC Radio Merseyside]] published a biography book about Billy Fury called ''Wondrous Face \u2013 The Billy Fury Story.'' In 2008 a biographical documentary film ''Billy Fury: His Wondrous Story'' was released on DVD.<ref name=\"HWS\" />\n\nOn 19 April 2003 a bronze statue of Fury was unveiled by [[Jack Good (producer)|Jack Good]] at the [[National Museums Liverpool|National Museum of Liverpool Life]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> The sculpture, by Tom Murphy, a Liverpool sculptor, was donated by 'The Sound of Fury' fan club after the money was raised by fans.\n\nIn 2010, Camden Council named a previously unnamed alleyway \"Billy Fury Way\" in his honour.

The singer's estate licensed the tracks to benefit his memorial fund, which finances equipment purchases for hospital heart units. In November 2011, further co-operation between the estate and Peaksoft resulted in the issuing of a second CD, ''The Lost Album'' (PEA014), which attempted to construct the format of an album recorded by Fury in 1967\u201371, but which was never released.\n\nFury's backing band from 1970 until 1976, when he stopped touring due to ill health, were Fury's Tornados, named by Fury and his then manager Hal Carter.

This nation was broken up into a number of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] clans who tended to live in a certain geographic area. Each clan contained about 50 to 100 people and, to avoid genetic problems, the men would marry women from other clans. So the clans were interrelated and members from one clan would frequently travel in the territory of others, including to hunt, trade and perform ceremonies. They didn't consider themselves owners of the land, rather custodians.<ref>''Speed the Plough \u2014 Ashfield 1788-1988'', by Sheena & Robert Coupe, published by Ashfield Municipal Council, 1988 {{ISBN|0-9595234-1-3}}</ref>\n\nWhat is now the Inner West was formerly home to two clans, the [[Cadigal]], whose land stretched along Port Jackson from South Head to [[Lewisham, New South Wales|Lewisham]], and the Wangal, whose land was immediately to the west of the Cadigals and stretched to about [[Homebush Bay, New South Wales|Homebush Bay]]. Other clans that would have been regular visitors to the area would have included the Birrabirragal and Muru-ora-dial in what is now the [[Eastern Suburbs (Sydney)|Eastern Suburbs]], the Bediagal and Kameygal from the [[Cooks River]] area to the south, the Burramattagal from the [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]] area to the west, and the Wallumattagal, Cammeraigal and Gorualgal from the northern shores of the Parramatta River.<ref>[http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/barani/themes/popups/group_locations.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004061748/http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/barani/themes/popups/group_locations.html |date=October 4, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Marrickville3.JPG|thumb|170px|House in [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]] a suburb of Sydney's Inner West]]\n\n==Geography==\nThe topography of the Inner West reflects rolling hills intersected by shallow valleys through which waterways including [[Iron Cove Creek]], [[Hawthorne Canal]] (formerly Long Cove Creek), [[Whites Creek (Annandale)|Whites Creek]] and [[Johnstons Creek (New South Wales)|Johnstons Creek]] flow. These waterways have been drastically altered since the late 19th century by the means of concrete lining. In the 1860s iron Cove Creek was a freely flowing waterway which in places broadened into ponds that made excellent and picturesque swimming holes. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} It is now barely a trickle lined by residential areas, parkland and fast-food restaurants.\n\n==Housing==\nThe suburbs within the region are characterised by a wide range of housing, ranging from timber cottages in Leichhardt and Lilyfield to substantial mansions in Stanmore and Strathfield and increasing amounts of medium to high-density housing, particularly along the railway lines. The Inner West includes some of the older constructions in Sydney such as the terraced houses of [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]], [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] and [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale]]. [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] has many old stone houses, dating from the mid to late 1800\u2019s. Parts of the inner west have been subject to [[gentrification]], particularly in [[Marrickville]], [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] and its surrounding areas.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tovey|first=Josephine|title=Bars open, property up: arise the 'new Paddington'|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/bars-open-property-up-arise-the-new-paddington-20100312-q45v.html|accessdate=15 November 2013|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Horin|first=Adele|title=Grunge gives way to gentrification in streets of Newtown|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/grunge-gives-way-to-gentrification-in-streets-of-newtown-20110114-19r9g.html|accessdate=15 November 2013|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>\n\n==Schools==\nIt is also the location of several tertiary institutions such as [[Australian Catholic University]], Catholic Institute of Sydney, the [[University of Sydney]], which is reflected in the high student populations amongst the more downtown areas.\n\nThe Inner West also features schools such as [[Sydney Secondary College]], [[Fort Street High School]], [[Burwood Girls High School]], [[Homebush Boys High School]], [[Strathfield Girls High School]], [[Ashfield Boys High School]], [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney]], [[Meriden School]], [[MLC School]], [[St. Patrick's College, Strathfield]], [[Trinity Grammar School, New South Wales|Trinity Grammar School]], [[Newington College]] and its preparatory school [[Wyvern House]], [[Santa Sabina College]] and [[Rosebank College]]. The Inner West's two oldest schools are [[Newington College]] (established in 1863) and [[Rosebank College]] (established in 1867).\n[[File:BurwoodNSWStPauls.jpg|thumb|St Paul's Anglican Church, [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]]]]\n[[File:Balmain Bank.JPG|thumb| Historic bank, [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]]]]\n[[File:Newtown School of the Arts.JPG|thumb|School of the Arts, [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]]]]\n[[File:Fortstreethighschool.jpg|thumb| Fort Street High School, [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]]]]\n[[File:Petersham1.JPG|thumb|[[Petersham railway station]]]]\n\n==Transport==\nPublic transport in the region includes trains, buses, ferries and light rail.<ref name=\"Destination New South Wales\">{{cite web|title=Inner West - Sydney City|url=http://www.sydney.com/destinations/sydney/inner-sydney|accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref> [[Sydney Trains]] [[Airport, Inner West & South Line]] runs from Central station, largely running south of Parramatta Road to Strathfield and then to Macarthur via Granville. The [[Northern Line (Sydney)|Northern Line]] follows the same route to Strathfield and then branches off to the north to Epping, with stops at North Strathfield, Concord West and Rhodes. The [[Bankstown Line]] provides train services to suburbs such as Erskineville, St Peters, Sydenham, Marrickville and Dulwich Hill. There are various bus routes provided largely by [[State Transit Authority|State Transit]] and [[Transit Systems Sydney|Transit Systems]]. [[Sydney Ferries]] operates services in the inner harbour and Parramatta river. The [[Dulwich Hill Line]] of [[Light rail in Sydney|Sydney's light rail network]] connects Pyrmont, Glebe, Lilyfield, Leichhardt and Lewisham to Central railway station.\n\n[[Parramatta Road]] runs through the middle of this area. Although still playing only a small part in the overall transport task, use of bicycles for transport has increased significantly in the Inner West since the 1990s. Denser populations and shorter distances mean cycling is often quicker and more convenient than driving or taking public transport.

So the clans were interrelated and members from one clan would frequently travel in the territory of others, including to hunt, trade and perform ceremonies. They didn't consider themselves owners of the land, rather custodians.<ref>''Speed the Plough \u2014 Ashfield 1788-1988'', by Sheena & Robert Coupe, published by Ashfield Municipal Council, 1988 {{ISBN|0-9595234-1-3}}</ref>\n\nWhat is now the Inner West was formerly home to two clans, the [[Cadigal]], whose land stretched along Port Jackson from South Head to [[Lewisham, New South Wales|Lewisham]], and the Wangal, whose land was immediately to the west of the Cadigals and stretched to about [[Homebush Bay, New South Wales|Homebush Bay]]. Other clans that would have been regular visitors to the area would have included the Birrabirragal and Muru-ora-dial in what is now the [[Eastern Suburbs (Sydney)|Eastern Suburbs]], the Bediagal and Kameygal from the [[Cooks River]] area to the south, the Burramattagal from the [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]] area to the west, and the Wallumattagal, Cammeraigal and Gorualgal from the northern shores of the Parramatta River.<ref>[http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/barani/themes/popups/group_locations.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004061748/http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/barani/themes/popups/group_locations.html |date=October 4, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Marrickville3.JPG|thumb|170px|House in [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]] a suburb of Sydney's Inner West]]\n\n==Geography==\nThe topography of the Inner West reflects rolling hills intersected by shallow valleys through which waterways including [[Iron Cove Creek]], [[Hawthorne Canal]] (formerly Long Cove Creek), [[Whites Creek (Annandale)|Whites Creek]] and [[Johnstons Creek (New South Wales)|Johnstons Creek]] flow. These waterways have been drastically altered since the late 19th century by the means of concrete lining.
