The detaining authority passes the order of detention on subjective satisfaction\u2026 To prevent misuse of this potentially dangerous power the law of preventive detention has to be strictly construed and meticulous compliance with the procedural safeguards, however technical, is, in our opinion, mandatory and vital.\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rekha vs State Of T.Nadu |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/192877/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Lack of SOPs ====\n\nAn RTI application to the J&K Home Department filed by members of the J&K RTI Movement revealed that the State Government of J&K has not made any Rules or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) under PSA, during the four decades of its existence.<ref name=\"SOP\">{{cite web |title=NO RULES, SOPS FOR ORDERING PREVENTIVE DETENTIONS UNDER J&K PSA |url=https://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/blog/no-rules-sops-for-ordering-preventive-detentions-under-jk-psa |website=HRI |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nEvery year the detaining authorities have been issuing hundreds and at times thousands of detention orders without any SOPs to guide them except the reports and dossiers prepared by the J&K Police.<ref name=\"SOP\"/>\n\n\n==== Failure to Scrutinize Evidence ====\n\nIn an interview with Amnesty International, a former District Magistrate said that the Magistrates do not have dedicated assistance available, which could verify and seriously examine the police version, thus the District Magistrate as to necessarily rely on the reports filed by the police.

The detaining authority passes the order of detention on subjective satisfaction\u2026 To prevent misuse of this potentially dangerous power the law of preventive detention has to be strictly construed and meticulous compliance with the procedural safeguards, however technical, is, in our opinion, mandatory and vital.\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rekha vs State Of T.Nadu |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/192877/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Lack of SOPs ====\n\nAn RTI application to the J&K Home Department filed by members of the J&K RTI Movement revealed that the State Government of J&K has not made any Rules or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) under PSA, during the four decades of its existence.<ref name=\"SOP\">{{cite web |title=NO RULES, SOPS FOR ORDERING PREVENTIVE DETENTIONS UNDER J&K PSA |url=https://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/blog/no-rules-sops-for-ordering-preventive-detentions-under-jk-psa |website=HRI |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nEvery year the detaining authorities have been issuing hundreds and at times thousands of detention orders without any SOPs to guide them except the reports and dossiers prepared by the J&K Police.<ref name=\"SOP\"/>\n\n\n==== Failure to Scrutinize Evidence ====\n\nIn an interview with Amnesty International, a former District Magistrate said that the Magistrates do not have dedicated assistance available, which could verify and seriously examine the police version, thus the District Magistrate as to necessarily rely on the reports filed by the police. Thus reducing their role to mere rubber stamps.<ref name=\"AI India\"/>\n\nAmnesty India observed a common flaw in the detention orders where the detaining authorities reproduced word-for-word the dossier given by the police which contained the allegations against the person detained.<ref name=\"AI India\"/> <br>\nMany such detention orders have been quashed by the High Court, for example in May 2017, a detention was quashed by the High Court, stating among other reasons: \u201cPerusal of grounds of detention would show that it is a verbatim copy of Dossier of Senior Superintendent of Police submitted by him to the Concerned Magistrate.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |title=Bashir Ahmad Mir vs State Of J&K |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/15456862/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Role of Advisory Boards  ===\n\nSince the PSA does not make any provision for judicial review or any appeal process to detainees, under Section 14 of the PSA<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>, a non- judicial body, Advisory Board is set up to review detention orders and determine whether there is sufficient cause for detention. The Advisory Board examines the case only in the initial stages of the detention. There is no provision in the PSA to appeal against the decision of the Advisory Board.<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/> \n\n==== Appointment  ====\n\nAdvisory Board consists of two members and a chairperson, which are appointed by the government. Prior to the Jammu & Kashmir (Preventive Detention Laws) Ordinance 2018,<ref name=\"Ord\"/> the members of the Advisory Board were appointed by the Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court.<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>\n\nThe ordinance removes the mandatory requirement of consultation with the Chief Justice of the J&K High Court.,<ref name=\"Ord\">{{cite web |title=Jammu & Kashmir (Preventive Detention Laws) Ordinance 2018 |url=http://jklaw.nic.in/pdf/preanative%20decation%20.pdf |website=JK Law Department |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Now the members \u2013 provided they were not sitting judges \u2013 would be appointed by the government on the recommendations of a 3-person committee made up of senior state bureaucrats.<ref name=\"Ord\"/> Thus enhancing the role that the executive play and reducing the independence of the Advisory Board. <ref name=\"AI India\"/>\n\n==== Functioning ====\n\nThe Advisory Board is required to review the grounds of detention and the representation, if any, by the person detained. Anyone detained under PSA is not entitled to legal counsel. <ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>\nThe board is known for almost always upholding the detention orders passed by executive officials.

Rather than going left-to-right as in modern European languages, or right-to-left as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \nalternate lines in boustrophedon must be read in opposite directions. Also, the individual characters are reversed, or mirrored. It was a common way of writing in stone in [[Ancient Greece]].\n\nMirror writing in [[Islamic calligraphy]] flourished during the early modern period, but its origins may stretch as far back as pre-Islamic mirror-image rock inscriptions in the [[Hejaz]]. \n\nThe earliest known non-natural [[Point reflection|rotational]] ambigram dates to [[1893]] by artist [[Peter Newell]]. Although better known for his children's books and illustrations for Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll, he published two books of reversible illustrations, in which the picture turns into a different image entirely when flipped upside down. The last page in his book ''Topsys & Turvys'' contains the phrase THE END, which, when inverted, reads PUZZLE. In ''Topsys & Turvys Number 2'' (1902), Newell ended with a variation on the ambigram in which THE END changes into PUZZLE 2.\n\nIn March 1904 [[Gustave Verbeek]] used ambigrams{{which|date=April 2020}} in three consecutive strips of \"The UpsideDowns of old man Muffaroo and little lady Lovekins\".{{dubious|date=April 2020}} {{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The format of that strip otherwise prevented the use of word balloons.{{explain|date=April 2020}} His comics were [[ambiguous image|ambiguous images]], made in such a way that one could read the 6 panel comic, flip the book and keep reading.   \n\nFrom June to September 1908, the British monthly ''The Strand'' published a series of ambigrams by different people in its \"Curiosities\" column.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite magazine|last=Newnes|first=George|date=1908|title=Curiosities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=45MkAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA359&lpg=PA359&dq=Possibly+B+is+the+only+letter+of+the+alphabet+that+will+produce+such+an+interesting+anomaly&source=bl&ots=ScGLkirrWp&sig=DY-p5rSxj-fKc1MoJv7_sruTSws&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXm8vdxJXQAhVGyyYKHbjiCKMQ6AEIIzAB|magazine=The Strand Magazine|issue=36|page=359|doi=|pmid=|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> Of particular interest is the fact that all four of the people submitting ambigrams believed them to be a rare property of particular words.

Some ambigrams feature a relationship between their [[Visual appearance|form]] and their content. Ambigrams usually fall into one of several categories:\n\n; 3-Dimensional : A design where an object is presented that will appear to read several letters or words when viewed from different angles. Such designs can be generated using [[constructive solid geometry]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Chain :A design where a word (or sometimes words) are interlinked, forming a repeating chain. Letters are usually overlapped meaning that a word will start partway through another word. Sometimes chain ambigrams are presented in the form of a circle.<ref name=\"John Langdon\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.johnlangdon.net/thoughts/types-of-ambigrams/|title=Types of Ambigrams {{!}} John Langdon|work=John Langdon|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}</ref> <!-- Please check the website as a reliable source.\nUsed for 13, 14, 16, and 17 -->\n\n; [[Dihedral prime|Dihedral]]: A natural mirror-image ambigram consisting of numerical digits.\n\n; Figure-ground :A design in which the spaces between the letters of one word form another word.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Fractal : A version of space-filling ambigrams where the tiled word branches from itself and then shrinks in a [[self-similar]] manner, forming a [[fractal]]. See [[Scott Kim]]'s fractal of the word \"TREE\" for an animated example.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottkim.com.previewc40.carrierzone.com/inversions/gallery/tree.html|title=Tree|last=Kim|first=Scott|date=1981|website=scottkim.com|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n; Mirror-image :A design that can be read when reflected in a mirror, usually as the same word or phrase both ways. Ambigrams that form different words when viewed in the mirror are also known as glass door ambigrams, because they can be printed on a glass door to be read differently when entering or exiting.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Multi-Lingual : An ambigram that can be read one way in one language and another way in a different language. Multi-lingual ambigrams can exist in all of the various styles of ambigrams, with multi-lingual perceptual shift ambigrams being particularly striking. The name '''sinosign''' has been proposed for the case of the shift being between [[Latin script]] and [[Hanzi|Chinese script]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Natural :A natural ambigram is a word that possesses one or more of the above symmetries when written in its natural state, requiring no typographic styling.  For example, the words \"dollop\", \"suns\" and \"pod\" form natural rotational ambigrams. In Korean,  \uacf0 (bear) and \ubb38 (door) form a natural rotational ambigram. In some fonts, the word \"swims\" forms a natural rotational ambigram. The word \"bud\" forms a natural mirror ambigram when reflected over a vertical axis, as does \"\u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0627{{lrm}}\", the name of the country [[Libya]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The words \"CHOICE\" and \"OXIDE\", in all capitals, form natural mirror ambigrams when reflected over a horizontal axis.  The longest such word is CHECKBOOK. The word \"TOOTH\", in all capitals, forms a natural mirror ambigram when its letters are stacked vertically and reflected over a vertical axis.  See the article ''[[transformation of text]]'' for a discussion of letter symmetry.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n;Perceptual Shift (Oscillation) :A design with no symmetry but can be read as two different words depending on how the curves of the letters are interpreted.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Rotational : A design that presents several instances of words when rotated through a fixed angle.  This is usually 180 degrees, but rotational ambigrams of other angles exist, for example 90 or 45 degrees.  The word spelled out from the alternative direction(s) is often the same, but may be a different word to the initially presented form.  A simple example is the lower-case abbreviation for \"Down\", ''dn'', which looks like the lower-case word ''up'' when rotated 180 degrees.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; [[Strobogrammatic number|Strobogrammatic]]: A natural rotational ambigram consisting of numerical digits.\n\n; Space-Filling : Similar to chain ambigrams, but tile to fill the 2-dimensional plane.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Spinonym : An ambigram in which all the letters are made of the same glyph, possibly rotated and/or inverted.

Rather than going left-to-right as in modern European languages, or right-to-left as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \nalternate lines in boustrophedon must be read in opposite directions. Also, the individual characters are reversed, or mirrored. It was a common way of writing in stone in [[Ancient Greece]].\n\nMirror writing in [[Islamic calligraphy]] flourished during the early modern period, but its origins may stretch as far back as pre-Islamic mirror-image rock inscriptions in the [[Hejaz]]. \n\nThe earliest known non-natural [[Point reflection|rotational]] ambigram dates to [[1893]] by artist [[Peter Newell]]. Although better known for his children's books and illustrations for Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll, he published two books of reversible illustrations, in which the picture turns into a different image entirely when flipped upside down. The last page in his book ''Topsys & Turvys'' contains the phrase THE END, which, when inverted, reads PUZZLE. In ''Topsys & Turvys Number 2'' (1902), Newell ended with a variation on the ambigram in which THE END changes into PUZZLE 2.\n\nIn March 1904 [[Gustave Verbeek]] used ambigrams{{which|date=April 2020}} in three consecutive strips of \"The UpsideDowns of old man Muffaroo and little lady Lovekins\".{{dubious|date=April 2020}} {{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The format of that strip otherwise prevented the use of word balloons.{{explain|date=April 2020}} His comics were [[ambiguous image|ambiguous images]], made in such a way that one could read the 6 panel comic, flip the book and keep reading.   \n\nFrom June to September 1908, the British monthly ''The Strand'' published a series of ambigrams by different people in its \"Curiosities\" column.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite magazine|last=Newnes|first=George|date=1908|title=Curiosities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=45MkAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA359&lpg=PA359&dq=Possibly+B+is+the+only+letter+of+the+alphabet+that+will+produce+such+an+interesting+anomaly&source=bl&ots=ScGLkirrWp&sig=DY-p5rSxj-fKc1MoJv7_sruTSws&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXm8vdxJXQAhVGyyYKHbjiCKMQ6AEIIzAB|magazine=The Strand Magazine|issue=36|page=359|doi=|pmid=|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> Of particular interest is the fact that all four of the people submitting ambigrams believed them to be a rare property of particular words. Mitchell T. Lavin, whose \"chump\" was published in June, wrote, \"I think it is in the only word in the English language which has this peculiarity,\" while Clarence Williams wrote, about his \"Bet\" ambigram, \"Possibly B is the only letter of the alphabet that will produce such an interesting anomaly.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRotational faces as [[optical illusion]] are very old, since [[:c:File:Norimberga,_medaglia_satirica_di_papa-diavolo,_1550_ca.JPG|metal coins with reversible figures]] were produced in 1550, and maybe earlier.

Some ambigrams feature a relationship between their [[Visual appearance|form]] and their content. Ambigrams usually fall into one of several categories:\n\n; 3-Dimensional : A design where an object is presented that will appear to read several letters or words when viewed from different angles. Such designs can be generated using [[constructive solid geometry]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Chain :A design where a word (or sometimes words) are interlinked, forming a repeating chain. Letters are usually overlapped meaning that a word will start partway through another word. Sometimes chain ambigrams are presented in the form of a circle.<ref name=\"John Langdon\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.johnlangdon.net/thoughts/types-of-ambigrams/|title=Types of Ambigrams {{!}} John Langdon|work=John Langdon|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}</ref> <!-- Please check the website as a reliable source.\nUsed for 13, 14, 16, and 17 -->\n\n; [[Dihedral prime|Dihedral]]: A natural mirror-image ambigram consisting of numerical digits.\n\n; Figure-ground :A design in which the spaces between the letters of one word form another word.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Fractal : A version of space-filling ambigrams where the tiled word branches from itself and then shrinks in a [[self-similar]] manner, forming a [[fractal]]. See [[Scott Kim]]'s fractal of the word \"TREE\" for an animated example.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottkim.com.previewc40.carrierzone.com/inversions/gallery/tree.html|title=Tree|last=Kim|first=Scott|date=1981|website=scottkim.com|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n; Mirror-image :A design that can be read when reflected in a mirror, usually as the same word or phrase both ways. Ambigrams that form different words when viewed in the mirror are also known as glass door ambigrams, because they can be printed on a glass door to be read differently when entering or exiting.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Multi-Lingual : An ambigram that can be read one way in one language and another way in a different language. Multi-lingual ambigrams can exist in all of the various styles of ambigrams, with multi-lingual perceptual shift ambigrams being particularly striking. The name '''sinosign''' has been proposed for the case of the shift being between [[Latin script]] and [[Hanzi|Chinese script]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Natural :A natural ambigram is a word that possesses one or more of the above symmetries when written in its natural state, requiring no typographic styling.  For example, the words \"dollop\", \"suns\" and \"pod\" form natural rotational ambigrams. In Korean,  \uacf0 (bear) and \ubb38 (door) form a natural rotational ambigram. In some fonts, the word \"swims\" forms a natural rotational ambigram. The word \"bud\" forms a natural mirror ambigram when reflected over a vertical axis, as does \"\u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0627{{lrm}}\", the name of the country [[Libya]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The words \"CHOICE\" and \"OXIDE\", in all capitals, form natural mirror ambigrams when reflected over a horizontal axis.  The longest such word is CHECKBOOK. The word \"TOOTH\", in all capitals, forms a natural mirror ambigram when its letters are stacked vertically and reflected over a vertical axis.  See the article ''[[transformation of text]]'' for a discussion of letter symmetry.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n;Perceptual Shift (Oscillation) :A design with no symmetry but can be read as two different words depending on how the curves of the letters are interpreted.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Rotational : A design that presents several instances of words when rotated through a fixed angle.  This is usually 180 degrees, but rotational ambigrams of other angles exist, for example 90 or 45 degrees.  The word spelled out from the alternative direction(s) is often the same, but may be a different word to the initially presented form.  A simple example is the lower-case abbreviation for \"Down\", ''dn'', which looks like the lower-case word ''up'' when rotated 180 degrees.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; [[Strobogrammatic number|Strobogrammatic]]: A natural rotational ambigram consisting of numerical digits.\n\n; Space-Filling : Similar to chain ambigrams, but tile to fill the 2-dimensional plane.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Spinonym : An ambigram in which all the letters are made of the same glyph, possibly rotated and/or inverted. WEB is an example of a word that can easily be made into a spinonym.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

It runs mostly along the [[Freiberger Mulde]] from [[Borsdorf]] via [[D\u00f6beln]] and [[Meissen]] to [[Coswig, Saxony|Coswig]] near [[Dresden]]. It is part of a long-distance connection from [[Leipzig]] to Dresden, but is now used for local traffic only.\n\n==History ==\nMeissen had been linked since 1 December 1860 to the [[Leipzig\u2013Dresden railway]] by a branch line from Coswig. On 7 July 1864 the [[Leipzig\u2013Dresden Railway Company]] ({{lang-de|Leipzig-Dresdner Eisenbahn-Compagnie}} submitted an application to build a second rail link between Leipzig and Dresden. It provided for a route along the Freiberger Mulde from D\u00f6beln to Meissen to connect with the existing branch line from Coswig. On 16 January 1866 the company was granted a concession for the construction of the line. Work began on 4 August 1865 near Borsdorf. The line was opened as follows:\n*14 May 1866: Borsdorf\u2013[[Grimma]]\n*27 October 1867: Grimma\u2013[[Leisnig]]\n*2 June 1868: Leisnig\u2013D\u00f6beln\n*25 October 1868: D\u00f6beln\u2013[[Nossen]]\n*22 December 1868: Nossen\u2013Meissen\n\nOn 1 July 1876, the Leipzig-Dresden Railway Company was nationalized and the line was then controlled by the [[Royal Saxon State Railways]]. Between 1898 and 1909, the Borsdorf\u2013Gro\u00dfbothen and D\u00f6beln\u2013Coswig sections were duplicated. Duplication was also later started between Gro\u00dfbothen and D\u00f6beln, but only the Gro\u00dfbothen\u2013Tanndorf section was completed because of the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939.\n\n[[File:Meissen - Overview.jpg|thumb|left|Meissen Elbe bridge (in background)]]\n[[File:S-Bahn Dresden Mei\u00dfen 4420.JPG|thumb|left|S-Bahn in Meissen]]\n\nOne of the largest construction projects of the interwar period was the rebuilding of the bridge over the [[Elbe]] in Meissen. Between 1925 and 1926, the Lauchhammer-Rheinmetall company rebuilt it with a new steel truss superstructure. The bridge escaped demolition in 1945, so the original bridge is now preserved, but it has only had a single track since 1946.\n\nAfter the Second World War one track of the line was dismantled to provide [[war reparations|reparations]] to the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nIn 1970, the Coswig\u2013Meissen-Triebischtal section was electrified for Dresden suburban services. On 18 December 1970, electric train operations started. A little later\u2014in September 1973\u2014the section was included in the network of the newly established [[Dresden S-Bahn]]. After that all rail services were broken in Meissen, with services operating between the Leipzig and Meissen and between Meissen\u2013Triebischtal and Dresden, requiring a change of trains. Even express trains on the line only ran between Leipzig and Meissen.\n\t\nIn December 1981, the second track was returned to service between Meissen and Coswig. In 1989, the short Borsdorf\u2013Beucha section was electrified. On 30 September 1989, the electrical equipment on this section was removed.\n\nA completely new situation emerged after the political changes in [[East Germany]] in 1989\u201390. For the first time in decades express trains ran between Leipzig and Dresden via D\u00f6beln. Together with the two S-Bahn services every hour between Leipzig and Meissen there were hourly express services. The Dresden S-Bahn service \u2014 now running as line S1 (Meissen-Triebischtal\u2013Sch\u00f6na) \u2014 operated after that at continuous 30-minute intervals from Meissen through Coswig to Dresden and Sch\u00f6na. Only in 2000, with the formation of the transport authorities of the [[Verkehrsverbund Oberelbe]] (Upper Elbe Transport Authority) and the ''Mitteldeutscher Verkehrsverbund'' (Central Germany Transport Authority), was this timetable abandoned. The express trains, which last ran between Leipzig and Zittau, were cancelled on 9 June 2001.\n\nThe line was broken at several points between Gro\u00dfbothen and Coswig during the [[2002 European floods#Germany|flood in August 2002]]. The most serious cases were with damage between Tanndorf and Leisnig. In addition to several smaller damaged areas, a total of 500 metres of track including the railway embankment were completely destroyed at Tanndorf. The line was restored to use on 21 August 2004. According to a town council, the federal government had invested \u20ac45 million in the line after the 2002 floods.<ref name=\"fp-2014-03-07\" />\n\n[[File:Bahnhof Nossen1.jpg|thumb|left|Trains crossing in Nossen]]\nBy December 2015, the service consisted of [[Regionalbahn]] trains running at two-hour intervals between Leipzig and Mei\u00dfen, with additional trains providing an hourly services in the morning and afternoon peaks. Outside of the peaks and on the weekend, the hourly service from Leipzig ends in Grimma. [[Siemens Desiro]] Classic diesel multiple units are used; at peak times running in double sets. The [[Symmetry minute]] of the timetable is between Leipzig and Nossen about three minutes earlier than usual, so that the transfer times of trains running in one direction and trains running in the other direction at crossing points, e.g. in Leipzig, may differ by up to eight minutes. Other trains run on weekdays in the morning and late afternoon in an alternating cycle between Leipzig and Grimma. In freight transport the line does not have much significance any more. This is essentially limited to the operation of the Rh\u00e4sa tank farm on the [[Riesa\u2013Nossen railway|former line to Riesa]].\n\n[[File:Bahnstrecke Borsdorf-Coswig in Meissen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The newly built two-track section between Mei\u00dfen Altstadt and Mei\u00dfen (November 2013)]]\n\nOn 2 May 2010, the first construction phase of the [[electronic interlocking]] (''Elektronischen Stellwerk'', ESTW) [[Mulde|Mulde Valley]] (''ESTW Muldental'') was put into operation with the ESTW-A Gro\u00dfbothen and the ESTW-A Leisnig. They are controlled from the sub-center in Geithain, which has been converted into an ESTW-Z control centre. At the end of July 2012 the connection of the Gro\u00dfsteinberg and Grimma ob Bf stations to the ESTW Muldental was completed. Naunhof station was integrated into the ESTW Muldental at the end of November 2013 after the construction of a second outside platform in the autumn of 2013. On 9 August 2015, Borsdorf-Naunhof was included as the last section of the ESTW with the converted Beucha station.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher= DB AG |title=unknown|date=9 August 2015|language=de}}</ref>\n\nThe Upper Elbe Transport Association (''Verkehrsverbund Oberelbe'', VVO) has been considering the permanent closure of local rail services between Nossen and Mei\u00dfen-Triebischtal since autumn 2010. A citizens' initiative collected 14,000 signatures to maintain services on the route in 2010. According to the citizens' initiative, more than 1,000 passengers per day were counted on the section of the line in 2001; the count was 400 at the beginning of 2014. Meanwhile, the direct connections to Dresden had been lost and the hourly service had been reduced to a two-hourly service.<ref name=\"da-2014-02-27\">{{cite news | author= Sebastian Fink | title=Mit Eilz\u00fcgen schnell wieder 1000 Fahrg\u00e4st | newspaper= D\u00f6belner Allgemeine Zeitung | date= 27 February 2014 | page= 11 | language=de }}</ref>\n\nOn 3 June 2013, the service between Gro\u00dfbothen and Mei\u00dfen had to be stopped due to a [[2013 European floods#Elbe river|flood]].

The line then passes through Beucha and the branch to the Beucha-Trebsen railway, which is only used for freight, and under the A14 and goes through the landscape protection area of the ''Naunhofer Forst'' (Naunhof forest), while on the eastern side is a recreational area with lakes in old quarries. The line crossed the newly built bypass road B 107n before Grimma, where it reaches the course of the Mulde for the first time. Before Gro\u00dfbothen the northern part of the landscape protection area of the ''Colditzer Forst'' (Colditz forest) is crossed, before the 1.5 kilometre-long station operating facilities are reached and [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 107|federal highway 107]] is crossed. The [[Glauchau\u2013Wurzen railway]], which crosses the Borsdorf-Coswig line at the exit from the station and runs parallel for about one kilometre, begins on the north side of the ''Inselbahnhof'' (\"island\" station building, that is, surrounded by rail tracks) before heading south to [[Colditz]]. Near K\u00f6ssern, the line changes for the first time to the north bank of the Mulde, until it changes back to the south near R\u00f6da. At the exit from Leisnig station, the line returns to the northern bank and then runs through the landscape protection area of Freiberger Mulde-Zschopau. After about 400 metres, the ruins of the [[Buch Abbey]] (''Kloster Buch'') are passed before the line switches again to the south side of the Freiberger Mulde at the mouth of the [[Zschopau (river)|Zschopau]]. Before D\u00f6beln, the line crosses the [[Chemnitz\u2013Riesa railway|line from Chemnitz]] together with [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 169|federal highway 169]].\n\nThe line leaves the [[Keilbahnhof]] (\"wedge station\") of [[D\u00f6beln Hauptbahnhof|D\u00f6beln]] in a southeastern direction and crosses the southern urban area, while the Riesa line branches off to the northeast. [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 175|Federal highway 175]] is crossed at the station exit. The line crosses the narrowing valley of the Freiberger Mulde several times after D\u00f6beln Zentrum station. After [[Niederstriegis]], the dismantled line of the former [[Ro\u00dfwein\u2013Niederwiesa railway]] approaches and follows the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig railway for about two kilometres to Ro\u00dfwein station. After crossing and recrossing the Freiberger Mulde, the [[Riesa\u2013Nossen railway|connecting line from the Rh\u00e4sa tank farm]] approaches from the north and the two lines runs parallel past the [[Altzella Abbey]] (''Kloster Altzella'') and meet the [[Nossen\u2013Moldava v Kru\u0161n\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch railway|Zellwald railway]], which comes from the south, pass under the B&nbsp;175 and enter Nossen station. The line crosses [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 101|federal highway 101]] at a level crossing and passes along a sloping section and reaches the Meissen highland in the [[Waldhufendorf]] (\"forest village\") of Eula. From Deutschebora, the highest point, the line turns north-east, crosses the A 14 and turns into the landscape protection area of the valley of the [[Triebisch]]. From here, it follows the river through the ''Garsebacher Schweiz'' (\"Garsebach Switzerland\") over a length of about 10 kilometres, past the ''G\u00f6tterfelsen'' (\"God's rocks\"), which rise 60 metres above the valley, to Mei\u00dfen-Triebischtal station, where the wiring for the Dresden S-Bahn begins. After crossing the Elbe together with [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 6|federal highway 6]] and passing through [[Meissen station]], the now two-track line turns south-east, rules through a sparsely-built flatland and rejoins the Leipzig\u2013Dresden railway between [[Weinb\u00f6hla]] and [[Coswig (b Dresden) station|Coswig]].\n\n=== Operating points===\n'''Grimma ob Bf''' ({{coord|51.230088|N|12.714177|E|region:DE-SN_type:railwaystation|format=dms|display=inline}}) \n[[File:Grimma Oberer Bahnhof.jpg|thumb|Grimma ob station]]\n''Grimma ob Bf'' was opened on 1 June 1866 with the name ''Grimma''. After the opening of the Gro\u00dfbothen\u2013Wurzen section of the [[Glauchau\u2013Wurzen railway]] ([[Mulde|Mulde Valley]] Railway) in 1877, the Grimma station was renamed ''Grimma ob Bf'' (short for ''oberer Bahnhof''\u2014\"upper station\") since the Mulde Valley Railway had a station in the town on the right bank of the Mulde called ''Grimma unt Bf'' (short for ''unterer Bahnhof''\u2014\"lower station\"). With the discontinuation of rail traffic on the Mulde Valley Railway (Grimma unt Bf\u2013Nerchau section) in 1967, ''Grimma ob Bf'' is the only railway station in the town.\n\n'''Gro\u00dfbothen''' ({{coord|51.1841|N|12.7607|E|region:DE-SN_type:railwaystation|format=dms|display=inline}}) }\n''Gro\u00dfbothen'' station was opened in 1867 with the Grimma\u2013Leisnig section of the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig railway of the [[Leipzig\u2013Dresden Railway Company]]. Although the station is in the Kleinbothen area, it was initially planned as the \u201cstation for [[Colditz]] in Gro\u00dfbothen\u201d. The connection to Colditz was made by stagecoach. With the opening of the Glauchau\u2013Wurzen railway (9 December 1875: Rochlitz\u2013Gro\u00dfbothen section; 30 June 1877: Gro\u00dfbothen\u2013Wurzen section), Gro\u00dfbothen became a railway junction and the entrance building was built as an Inselbahnhof (\"island\" station building) at that time. On the north side are the tracks of the Glauchau\u2013Wurzen railway and on the south side are the tracks of the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig railway. Already at that time, the [[Borna\u2013Gro\u00dfbothen railway]] was planned, although it was only opened in 1937 after a long construction period. After the commissioning of the Borna\u2013Gro\u00dfbothen line, there were four [[Lever frame|mechanical signal boxes]]s in the station. For the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig line, signal box 1 was located on the western end (towards Borsdorf) and signal box 3, which was also controlled the whole station, was located at the eastern end.\n[[File:Gro\u00dfbothenBf1.JPG|thumb|Gro\u00dfbothen station now]]\nAfter the Second World War, Gro\u00dfbothen lost importance because of a break in the line to Wurzen and the dismantling of the Borna\u2013Gro\u00dfbothen line.<ref>{{cite book |author= Manfred Berger |title= Historische Bahnhofsbauten&nbsp;I&nbsp;\u2013 Sachsen, Preu\u00dfen, Mecklenburg und Th\u00fcringen |edition=2 |publisher= Transpress Verlag |location= Berlin |year=1987 |ISBN= 3-344-00066-7 |page= 99&nbsp;ff. |language=de}}</ref> Signal box 2 was closed by 1980; the western end on the Mulde Valley Railway side received electrically-actuated, remotely-controlled points and colour light signals; these were connected to signal box 1. Shortly after 1990, the middle of the three railway platforms of the Mulden Valley Railway was closed. Traffic on the Colditz\u2013Gro\u00dfbothen section of the Mulden Valley Railway was discontinued on 27 May 2000. In the rationalisation of the facilities, in preparation for the construction of the electronic interlocking system, the connections between the Mulde Valley Railway and the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig railway at the eastern end were omitted. Since 2010, an Alcatel electronic signal box has been put into operation; it is controlled from Geithain station. The central platform of the three platforms on the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig side was retained, but the points were locked, which made it no longer usable. Since 2014, there are again three platform faces on the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig line side of the station and one of the tracks leased to the DRE on the Mulde Valley Railway is accessible by train to and from Grimma ob station. Signal box 4 was not included in the electronic signalling and was retained.\n\n'''D\u00f6beln Hauptbahnhof''' ({{coord|51.126574|N|13.094988|E|region:DE-SN_type:railwaystation|format=dms|display=inline}}) \n[[File:D\u00f6beln Hbf 001.jpg|thumb|D\u00f6beln Hbf entrance building of 1868]]\n{{main|D\u00f6beln Hauptbahnhof}}\nThe diesel-worked Borsdorf\u2013Coswig and the electrified [[Riesa\u2013Chemnitz railway|Riesa\u2013Chemnitz]] lines cross in ''D\u00f6beln Hauptbahnhof''.

In the meantime, the halt had been upgraded to a station  with local goods facilities for the supply of the local industry. After the dismantling of the second track between D\u00f6beln and Mei\u00dfen, only the northern platform was used; after the reconstruction of the station buildings in the middle of the 1970s, only the southern platform was used. In the 1990s, the station became a halt again (now meaning that is it has no [[Railroad switch|sets of points]]). Since 21 August 2004, the station has been called ''D\u00f6beln Zentrum''. The tracks originally ran at street level until 1904, when the line was tunnelled under Ro\u00dfweiner Stra\u00dfe and the tracks were lowered around six metres. Since the (now unused) station building remained at street level, the platform is only accessible by stairs from the Ro\u00dfweiner Stra\u00dfe bridge. The abandoned pedestrian bridge from the entrance building to the southern platform was removed as part of the rebuilding of the station superstructure in the 1970s.\n\n'''Ro\u00dfwein''' ({{coord|51.060594|N|13.185154|E|region:DE-SN_type:railwaystation|format=dms|display=inline}}) \n[[File:Ro\u00dfweinBf2.JPG|thumb|Ro\u00dfwein station]]\n''Ro\u00dfwein'' station was opened on 25 October 1868 with the completion of the D\u00f6beln\u2013Nossen section of the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig railway.

It runs mostly along the [[Freiberger Mulde]] from [[Borsdorf]] via [[D\u00f6beln]] and [[Meissen]] to [[Coswig, Saxony|Coswig]] near [[Dresden]]. It is part of a long distance connection from [[Leipzig]] to Dresden, but is now used for local traffic only.\n\n==History ==\nMeissen had been linked since 1 December 1860 to the [[Leipzig\u2013Dresden railway]] by a branch line from Coswig. On 7 July 1864 the [[Leipzig\u2013Dresden Railway Company]] ({{lang-de|Leipzig-Dresdner Eisenbahn-Compagnie}} submitted an application to build a second rail link between Leipzig and Dresden. It provided for a route along the Freiberger Mulde from D\u00f6beln to Meissen to connect with the existing branch line from Coswig. On 16 January 1866 the company was granted a concession for the construction of the line. Work began on 4 August 1865 near Borsdorf. The line was opened as follows:\n*14 May 1866: Borsdorf\u2013[[Grimma]]\n*27 October 1867: Grimma\u2013[[Leisnig]]\n*2 June 1868: Leisnig\u2013D\u00f6beln\n*25 October 1868: D\u00f6beln\u2013[[Nossen]]\n*22 December 1868: Nossen\u2013Meissen\n\nOn 1 July 1876, the Leipzig-Dresden Railway Company was nationalized and the line was then controlled by the [[Royal Saxon State Railways]]. Between 1898 and 1909, the Borsdorf\u2013Gro\u00dfbothen and D\u00f6beln\u2013Coswig sections were duplicated. Duplication was also later started between Gro\u00dfbothen and D\u00f6beln, but only the Gro\u00dfbothen\u2013Tanndorf section was completed because of the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939.\n\n[[File:Meissen - Overview.jpg|thumb|left|Meissen Elbe bridge (in background)]]\n[[File:S-Bahn Dresden Mei\u00dfen 4420.JPG|thumb|left|S-Bahn in Meissen]]\n\nOne of the largest construction projects of the interwar period was the rebuilding of the bridge over the [[Elbe]] in Meissen. Between 1925 and 1926, the Lauchhammer-Rheinmetall company rebuilt it with a new steel truss superstructure. The bridge escaped demolition in 1945, so the original bridge is now preserved, but it has only had a single track since 1946.\n\nAfter the Second World War one track of the line was dismantled to provide [[war reparations|reparations]] to the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nIn 1970, the Coswig\u2013Meissen-Triebischtal section was electrified for Dresden suburban services. On 18 December 1970, electric train operations started. A little later\u2014in September 1973\u2014the section was included in the network of the newly established [[Dresden S-Bahn]]. After that all rail services were broken in Meissen, with services operating between the Leipzig and Meissen and between Meissen\u2013Triebischtal and Dresden, requiring a change of trains. Even express trains on the line only ran between Leipzig and Meissen.\n\t\nIn December 1981, the second track was returned to service between Meissen and Coswig. In 1989, the short Borsdorf\u2013Beucha section was electrified. On 30 September 1989, the electrical equipment on this section was removed.\n\nA completely new situation emerged after the political changes in [[East Germany]] in 1989\u201390. For the first time in decades express trains ran between Leipzig and Dresden via D\u00f6beln. Together with the two S-Bahn services every hour between Leipzig and Meissen there were hourly express services. The [[Dresden S-Bahn]] service \u2014 now running as line S1 (Meissen-Triebischtal\u2013Sch\u00f6na) \u2014 operated after that at continuous 30-minute intervals from Meissen through Coswig to Dresden and Sch\u00f6na. Only in 2000, with the formation of the transport authorities of the [[Verkehrsverbund Oberelbe]] (Upper Elbe Transport Authority) and the ''Mitteldeutscher Verkehrsverbund'' (Central Germany Transport Authority), was this timetable abandoned. The express trains, which last ran between Leipzig and Zittau, were cancelled on 9 June 2001.\n\nThe line was broken at several points between Gro\u00dfbothen and Coswig during the [[2002 European floods#Germany|flood in August 2002]]. The most serious cases were with damage between Tanndorf and Leisnig. In addition to several smaller damaged areas, a total of 500 metres of track including the railway embankment were completely destroyed at Tanndorf. The line was restored to use on 21 August 2004. According to a town council, the federal government had invested \u20ac45 million in the line after the 2002 floods.<ref name=\"fp-2014-03-07\" />\n\n[[File:Bahnhof Nossen1.jpg|thumb|left|Trains crossing in Nossen]]\nBy December 2015, the service consisted of [[Regionalbahn]] trains running at two-hour intervals between Leipzig and Mei\u00dfen, with additional trains providing an hourly services in the morning and afternoon peaks. Outside of the peaks and on the weekend, the hourly service from Leipzig ends in Grimma. [[Siemens Desiro]] Classic diesel multiple units are used; at peak times running in double sets. The [[Symmetry minute]] of the timetable is between Leipzig and Nossen about three minutes earlier than usual, so that the transfer times of trains running in one direction and trains running in the other direction at crossing points, e.g. in Leipzig, may differ by up to eight minutes. Other trains run on weekdays in the morning and late afternoon in an alternating cycle between Leipzig and Grimma. In freight transport the line does not have much significance any more. This is essentially limited to the operation of the Rh\u00e4sa tank farm on the [[Riesa\u2013Nossen railway|former line to Riesa]].\n\n[[File:Bahnstrecke Borsdorf-Coswig in Meissen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The newly built two-track section between Mei\u00dfen Altstadt and Mei\u00dfen (November 2013)]]\n\nOn 2 May 2010, the first construction phase of the [[electronic interlocking]] (''Elektronischen Stellwerk'', ESTW) [[Mulde|Mulde Valley]] (''ESTW Muldental'') was put into operation with the ESTW-A Gro\u00dfbothen and the ESTW-A Leisnig. They are controlled from the sub-center in Geithain, which has been converted into an ESTW-Z control centre. At the end of July 2012 the connection of the Gro\u00dfsteinberg and Grimma ob Bf stations to the ESTW Muldental was completed. Naunhof station was integrated into the ESTW Muldental at the end of November 2013 after the construction of a second outside platform in the autumn of 2013. On 9 August 2015, Borsdorf-Naunhof was included as the last section of the ESTW with the converted Beucha station.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher= DB AG |title=unknown|date=9 August 2015|language=de}}</ref>\n\nThe Upper Elbe Transport Association (''Verkehrsverbund Oberelbe'', VVO) has been considering the permanent closure of local rail services between Nossen and Mei\u00dfen-Triebischtal since autumn 2010. A citizens' initiative collected 14,000 signatures to maintain services on the route in 2010. According to the citizens' initiative, more than 1,000 passengers per day were counted on the section of the line in 2001; the count was 400 at the beginning of 2014. Meanwhile, the direct connections to Dresden had been lost and the hourly service had been reduced to a two-hourly service.<ref name=\"da-2014-02-27\">{{cite news | author= Sebastian Fink | title=Mit Eilz\u00fcgen schnell wieder 1000 Fahrg\u00e4st | newspaper= D\u00f6belner Allgemeine Zeitung | date= 27 February 2014 | page= 11 | language=de }}</ref>\n\nOn 3 June 2013, the service between Gro\u00dfbothen and Mei\u00dfen had to be stopped due to a [[2013 European floods#Elbe river|flood]].

According to these figures, it incurred annual infrastructure revenues of around \u20ac1.3 million while its costs amounted to \u20ac2.3 million (approximately \u20ac1.4 million for staff and \u20ac0.8 million for maintenance). Between 2014 and 2018, investment of around \u20ac24.8 million would also be expected. The sale price was \u20ac627,990 (net) and the annual rent was \u20ac50,239.<ref name=\"DB_Abgabe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnetz.de/file/2734940/data/ausschreibung_6386.pdf|format=PDF|title=Abgabe von Eisenbahninfrastruktur, Strecke D\u00f6beln (ausschlie\u00dflich) \u2013 Mei\u00dfen Triebischtal (ausschlie\u00dflich), Ausschreibung vom 28.06.2013 bis 28.09.2013|publisher=DB Netz AG|date=28 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210225923/http://www.dbnetz.de/file/2734940/data/ausschreibung_6386.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-10|accessdate=20 December 2016|language=de}}</ref> DB Netz decided in the middle of 2015 to transfer this section to the ''Nossen-Riesaer Eisenbahn-Compagnie GmbH'' (\"Nossen-Riesa Railway Company\", NRE) as railway infrastructure owner.<ref name=\"DB_NRE_Uebergabe\">{{cite press release|url=http://fahrweg.dbnetze.com/fahrweg-de/medien/Kundeninformationen/9837432/2015_33_Uebergabe_Doebeln.html|title=Strecke 6386 D\u00f6beln Hbf \u2013 Mei\u00dfen Triebischtal: \u00c4nderung des Betreibers|publisher=DB Netz AG|date=12 August 2015|accessdate=20 December 2016|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229071514/http://fahrweg.dbnetze.com/fahrweg-de/medien/Kundeninformationen/9837432/2015_33_Uebergabe_Doebeln.html#|archive-date=2015-12-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> The company is already a tenant of the Nossen\u2013Riesa and Nossen\u2013Ausschlichstelle Rh\u00e4sa (to the Neubodenbach tank farm) sections.<ref name=\"eri-2016-5\">{{cite journal | title= Strecke D\u00f6beln \u2013 Meissen Triebischtal wird verpachtet | journal =[[Eisenbahn-Revue International]] | issue= 1 | year=2016 | page= 5 | ISSN= 1421-2811|language=de}}</ref>\n\nThe transfer, which was originally scheduled for 13 December 2015, was delayed until 16 April 2016,<ref name=\"SZO_StillRuhtHaltestelle\">{{cite news|url= http://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/still-ruht-die-haltestelle-3312972.html |title=Still ruht die Haltestelle|newspaper=S\u00e4chsische Zeitung|date=2 February 2016| accessdate=20 December 2016|language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title= Infrastruktur\u00fcbernahme in Sachsen | journal = eisenbahn-magazin | issue= 6 | year=2016 | page=19  | ISSN= 0342-1902|language=de}}</ref> after an earlier delay to February 2016, announced in 2015.<ref name=\"DB_NRE_Uebergabeverzoegerung\">{{cite press release|url=http://fahrweg.dbnetze.com/fahrweg-de/medien/Kundeninformationen/10439224/2015_48_Uebergabe_Doebeln.html|title=Strecke 6386 D\u00f6beln Hbf \u2013 Mei\u00dfen Triebischtal: \u00c4nderung des Betreibers (Verschiebung)|publisher=DB Netz AG|date=26 November 2015|accessdate=20 December 2016|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211074136/http://fahrweg.dbnetze.com/fahrweg-de/medien/Kundeninformationen/10439224/2015_48_Uebergabe_Doebeln.html#|archive-date=2015-12-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> The NRE intends to operate the D\u00f6beln\u2013Mei\u00dfen\u2013Triebischtal section using the [[Direct traffic control]] operating procedure.<ref name=\"DB_NRE_Uebergabe\" />\n\n== Route description==\n=== Course===\n\nThe line branches off at Borsdorf towards the southeast from the Leipzig\u2013Dresden Railway and runs without sharp curves through agricultural areas. The line then passes through Beucha and the branch to the Beucha-Trebsen railway, which is only used for freight, and under the [[Bundesautobahn 14|A14]] and goes through the landscape protection area of the ''Naunhofer Forst'' (Naunhof forest), while on the eastern side is a recreational area with lakes in old quarries. The line crossed the newly built bypass road B 107n before Grimma, where it reaches the course of the Mulde for the first time. Before Gro\u00dfbothen the northern part of the landscape protection area of the ''Colditzer Forst'' (Colditz forest) is crossed, before the 1.5 kilometre-long station operating facilities are reached and [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 107|federal highway 107]] is crossed. The [[Glauchau\u2013Wurzen railway]], which crosses the Borsdorf-Coswig line at the exit from the station and runs parallel for about one kilometre, begins on the north side of the ''Inselbahnhof'' (\"island\" station building, that is, surrounded by rail tracks) before heading south to [[Colditz]]. Near K\u00f6ssern, the line changes for the first time to the north bank of the Mulde, until it changes back to the south near R\u00f6da. At the exit from Leisnig station, the line returns to the northern bank and then runs through the landscape protection area of Freiberger Mulde-Zschopau. After about 400 metres, the ruins of the [[Buch Abbey]] (''Kloster Buch'') are passed before the line switches again to the south side of the Freiberger Mulde at the mouth of the [[Zschopau (river)|Zschopau]]. Before D\u00f6beln, the line crosses the [[Chemnitz\u2013Riesa railway|line from Chemnitz]] together with [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 169|federal highway 169]].\n\nThe line leaves the [[Keilbahnhof]] (\"wedge station\") of [[D\u00f6beln Hauptbahnhof|D\u00f6beln]] in a southeastern direction and crosses the southern urban area, while the Riesa line branches off to the northeast. [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 175|Federal highway 175]] is crossed at the station exit. The line crosses the narrowing valley of the Freiberger Mulde several times after D\u00f6beln Zentrum station. After [[Niederstriegis]], the dismantled line of the former [[Ro\u00dfwein\u2013Niederwiesa railway]] approaches and follows the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig railway for about two kilometres to Ro\u00dfwein station. After crossing and recrossing the Freiberger Mulde, the [[Riesa\u2013Nossen railway|connecting line from the Rh\u00e4sa tank farm]] approaches from the north and the two lines runs parallel past the [[Altzella Abbey]] (''Kloster Altzella'') and meet the [[Nossen\u2013Moldava v Kru\u0161n\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch railway|Zellwald railway]], which comes from the south, pass under the B&nbsp;175 and enter Nossen station. The line crosses [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 101|federal highway 101]] at a level crossing and passes along a sloping section and reaches the Meissen highland in the [[Waldhufendorf]] (\"forest village\") of Eula. From Deutschebora, the highest point, the line turns north-east, crosses the [[Bundesautobahn 14|A 14]] and turns into the landscape protection area of the valley of the [[Triebisch]]. From here, it follows the river through the ''Garsebacher Schweiz'' (\"Garsebach Switzerland\") over a length of about 10 kilometres, past the ''G\u00f6tterfelsen'' (\"God's rocks\"), which rise 60 metres above the valley, to Mei\u00dfen-Triebischtal station, where the wiring for the [[Dresden S-Bahn]] begins. After crossing the Elbe together with [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 6|federal highway 6]] and passing through [[Meissen station]], the now two-track line turns south-east, rules through a sparsely-built flatland and rejoins the Leipzig\u2013Dresden railway between [[Weinb\u00f6hla]] and [[Coswig (b Dresden) station|Coswig]].\n\n=== Operating points===\n'''Grimma ob Bf''' ({{coord|51.230088|N|12.714177|E|region:DE-SN_type:railwaystation|format=dms|display=inline}}) \n[[File:Grimma Oberer Bahnhof.jpg|thumb|Grimma ob station]]\n''Grimma ob Bf'' was opened on 1 June 1866 with the name ''Grimma''. After the opening of the Gro\u00dfbothen\u2013Wurzen section of the [[Glauchau\u2013Wurzen railway]] ([[Mulde|Mulde Valley]] Railway) in 1877, the Grimma station was renamed ''Grimma ob Bf'' (short for ''oberer Bahnhof''\u2014\"upper station\") since the Mulde Valley Railway had a station in the town on the right bank of the Mulde called ''Grimma unt Bf'' (short for ''unterer Bahnhof''\u2014\"lower station\"). With the discontinuation of rail traffic on the Mulde Valley Railway (Grimma unt Bf\u2013Nerchau section) in 1967, ''Grimma ob Bf'' is the only railway station in the town.\n\n'''Gro\u00dfbothen''' ({{coord|51.1841|N|12.7607|E|region:DE-SN_type:railwaystation|format=dms|display=inline}}) }\n''Gro\u00dfbothen'' station was opened in 1867 with the Grimma\u2013Leisnig section of the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig railway of the [[Leipzig\u2013Dresden Railway Company]]. Although the station is in the Kleinbothen area, it was initially planned as the \u201cstation for [[Colditz]] in Gro\u00dfbothen\u201d. The connection to Colditz was made by stagecoach. With the opening of the Glauchau\u2013Wurzen railway (9 December 1875: Rochlitz\u2013Gro\u00dfbothen section; 30 June 1877: Gro\u00dfbothen\u2013Wurzen section), Gro\u00dfbothen became a railway junction and the entrance building was built as an Inselbahnhof (\"island\" station building) at that time. On the north side are the tracks of the Glauchau\u2013Wurzen railway and on the south side are the tracks of the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig railway. Already at that time, the [[Borna\u2013Gro\u00dfbothen railway]] was planned, although it was only opened in 1937 after a long construction period. After the commissioning of the Borna\u2013Gro\u00dfbothen line, there were four [[Lever frame|mechanical signal boxes]]s in the station. For the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig line, signal box 1 was located on the western end (towards Borsdorf) and signal box 3, which was also controlled the whole station, was located at the eastern end.\n[[File:Gro\u00dfbothenBf1.JPG|thumb|Gro\u00dfbothen station now]]\nAfter the Second World War, Gro\u00dfbothen lost importance because of a break in the line to Wurzen and the dismantling of the Borna\u2013Gro\u00dfbothen line.<ref>{{cite book |author= Manfred Berger |title= Historische Bahnhofsbauten&nbsp;I&nbsp;\u2013 Sachsen, Preu\u00dfen, Mecklenburg und Th\u00fcringen |edition=2 |publisher= Transpress Verlag |location= Berlin |year=1987 |ISBN= 3-344-00066-7 |page= 99&nbsp;ff. |language=de}}</ref> Signal box 2 was closed by 1980; the western end on the Mulde Valley Railway side received electrically-actuated, remotely-controlled points and colour light signals; these were connected to signal box 1. Shortly after 1990, the middle of the three railway platforms of the Mulden Valley Railway was closed. Traffic on the Colditz\u2013Gro\u00dfbothen section of the Mulden Valley Railway was discontinued on 27 May 2000. In the rationalisation of the facilities, in preparation for the construction of the electronic interlocking system, the connections between the Mulde Valley Railway and the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig railway at the eastern end were omitted. Since 2010, an Alcatel electronic signal box has been put into operation; it is controlled from Geithain station. The central platform of the three platforms on the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig side was retained, but the points were locked, which made it no longer usable. Since 2014, there are again three platform faces on the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig line side of the station and one of the tracks leased to the DRE on the Mulde Valley Railway is accessible by train to and from Grimma ob station. Signal box 4 was not included in the electronic signalling and was retained.\n\n'''D\u00f6beln Hauptbahnhof''' ({{coord|51.126574|N|13.094988|E|region:DE-SN_type:railwaystation|format=dms|display=inline}}) \n[[File:D\u00f6beln Hbf 001.jpg|thumb|D\u00f6beln Hbf entrance building of 1868]]\n{{main|D\u00f6beln Hauptbahnhof}}\nThe diesel-worked Borsdorf\u2013Coswig and the electrified [[Riesa\u2013Chemnitz railway|Riesa\u2013Chemnitz]] lines cross in ''D\u00f6beln Hauptbahnhof''. It was opened on 2 June 1868. Sidings on the Coswig line north-east of the Hbf are electrified. The station building of 1868, unchanged to this day, is a heritage listed building. Between 1892 and 1926 the [[D\u00f6beln Tramway|D\u00f6belner Stra\u00dfenbahn]], a [[Horse car|horse tramway]], ran for {{convert|2|km|spell=in}} from the station to central D\u00f6beln.\n\n'''D\u00f6beln Zentrum''' ({{coord|51.116331|N|13.124715|E|region:DE-SN_type:railwaystation|format=dms|display=inline}}) \n[[File:Bahnhof D\u00f6beln Zentrum 001.jpg|thumb|Entrance building of D\u00f6beln Zentrum station]]\nIn 1868 the station was opened as D\u00f6beln halt (''Haltepunkt'') and renamed ''D\u00f6beln Ost'' (D\u00f6beln east) in 1905. In the meantime, the halt had been upgraded to a station  with local goods facilities for the supply of the local industry. After the dismantling of the second track between D\u00f6beln and Mei\u00dfen, only the northern platform was used; after the reconstruction of the station buildings in the middle of the 1970s, only the southern platform was used. In the 1990s, the station became a halt again (now meaning that is it has no [[Railroad switch|sets of points]]). Since 21 August 2004, the station has been called ''D\u00f6beln Zentrum''. The tracks originally ran at street level until 1904, when the line was tunnelled under Ro\u00dfweiner Stra\u00dfe and the tracks were lowered around six metres. Since the (now unused) station building remained at street level, the platform is only accessible by stairs from the Ro\u00dfweiner Stra\u00dfe bridge. The abandoned pedestrian bridge from the entrance building to the southern platform was removed as part of the rebuilding of the station superstructure in the 1970s.\n\n'''Ro\u00dfwein''' ({{coord|51.060594|N|13.185154|E|region:DE-SN_type:railwaystation|format=dms|display=inline}}) \n[[File:Ro\u00dfweinBf2.JPG|thumb|Ro\u00dfwein station]]\n''Ro\u00dfwein'' station was opened on 25 October 1868 with the completion of the D\u00f6beln\u2013Nossen section of the Borsdorf\u2013Coswig railway.

Over the coming decades, Khalili created eight distinct art collections under the auspices of the Khalili Family Trust. Khalili is said to have initially generated capital in the 1980s through the sale of a company and also [[venture capital]]. Since then his wealth has grown substantially, which he stated in an interview was due to \"dealing in art, commodities and real estate\". Khalili is known for the purchase of a number of large properties in London. One of his properties in [[Kensington Palace Gardens]], was sold to [[Bernie Ecclestone]] for \u00a357 million.

In 1978, the price of Islamic art fell substantially according to an article in ''[[Saudi Aramco World]]''.<ref name=aramco>{{cite web|last1=Shah|first1=Tahir|title=The Khalili Collection of Islamic Art|url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/199406/the.khalili.collection.of.islamic.art.htm|publisher=[[Saudi Aramco World]]|date=December 1994}}</ref> Aramco World stated in the article that Khalili continued to invest in Islamic art during this period and this was one of the reasons he was able to acquire so many high quality works for low prices.<ref name=aramco />\n\nPeople close to Khalili stated that he invested wisely and often discreetly. In a ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' article, Michael Spink stated the following about Khalili's collection and growth of wealth; \"he would buy items for \u00a32,000 which, over a long period, appreciated to \u00a3200,000. People did not always realise that it was him doing the buying.\" Khalili's dealership was based in Mayfair's [[Clifford Street]] in the 1980s. When asked directly how he had gathered his wealth during the 1970s and 1980s, Khalili stated it was from sugar and coffee trading, the options market, property investments and works of art.<ref name=ESMar09 />\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the scale of Khalili's collection greatly expanded. In the early 1990s, he began to publish a 27-volume catalogue of his Islamic art collection, for which he commissioned a number of leading [[Islamic]] scholars. In 1992, he was interviewed by ''[[The Independent]]'' following the launch of the first volume of this catalogue of Islamic art. According to the article, suspicions in the art industry were that Khalili was assembling the collection on behalf of a rich investor. The release of the collection under his own name stopped those suspicions and showed Khalili's collection as belonging to himself and his family.<ref name=independent>{{cite web|last1=Norman|first1=Geraldine|title=Art Market: Mysterious gifts from the East: Who is the man who has collected Islam's finest treasures and offered them to Britain as a pounds 1bn bequest?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-market-mysterious-gifts-from-the-east-who-is-the-man-who-has-collected-islams-finest-treasures-1563284.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=12 December 1992}}</ref>\n\nDuring the same period, Khalili was an art advisor to [[Hassanal Bolkiah]], The Sultan of [[Brunei]].

It was suggested that the museum would be known as the Khalili Museum, with the running costs of the museum and insurance to be publicly funded. The offer was made with the potential for turning the donation into a gift at the expiration of the 15-year period. The Conservative politician [[Lord Young of Graffham]] and the public relations executive [[Tim Bell|Lord Bell]] lobbied the government to accept Khalili's offer.<ref name=IndDec92/> Many expressed an interest in the proposal by Khalili for a London-based Islamic museum, including [[Prince Charles]].\n\n==Khallili Collections==\n[[File:Khalili Collection Islamic Art 03.jpg|thumb|Folio from the Copy of [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsi]]\u2018s [[Shahnameh|Shahnamah]] Made for [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]], [[Tabriz]], Iran, 1520s \u2013 1540s.

The significance of the documents is that they are the oldest correspondence of the administration of [[Bactria]] and [[Sogdiana]]. The documents are written in [[Old Aramaic language|Official Aramaic]] and were likely from the historical city of [[Balkh]].

The garments have been worn to demonstrate gender, age, status and wealth throughout Japan's history. The collection reveals a variety in [[kimono]] designs, illustrating how the design and use of kimono have changed over the centuries. The collection mainly represents four periods, the [[Edo period]] (1603-1868), the [[Meiji period]] (1868-1912), [[Taisho]] (1912-1926) and early [[Sh\u014dwa period|Showa]] (1926-1989), with a few selected pieces produced later on.<ref name=khalilicollections />\n\nThe Khalili Collection of Swedish Textiles comprises nearly a hundred textile panels, dating between 1700-1900.

He graduated from [[Queens College, City University of New York]] in 1974 with a computer science degree. He later received a PhD degree in Islamic art in 1988, from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], London, writing his thesis on Islamic [[lacquerware]].\n\nHe first started to collect art in New York during the 1970s, while also spending a lot of time in London investing in property during the 1980s. Over the coming decades, Khalili created eight distinct art collections under the auspices of the Khalili Family Trust. Khalili is said to have initially generated capital in the 1980s through the sale of a company and also [[venture capital]]. Since then his wealth has grown substantially, which he stated in an interview was due to \"dealing in art, commodities and real estate\". Khalili is known for the purchase of a number of large properties in London. One of his properties in [[Kensington Palace Gardens]], was sold to [[Bernie Ecclestone]] for \u00a357 million. He was also the co-owner of Sixty London on [[Holborn Viaduct]], London. It is currently leased by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] as their London office.\n\nIn 1995, he founded the [[Maimonides Foundation|Maimonides Interfaith Foundation]] where he serves as Chairman.

In a ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' article, Michael Spink stated the following about Khalili's collection and growth of wealth; \"he would buy items for \u00a32,000 which, over a long period, appreciated to \u00a3200,000.

In the early 1990s, he began to publish a 27-volume catalogue of his Islamic art collection, for which he commissioned a number of leading [[Islamic]] scholars. In 1992, he was interviewed by ''[[The Independent]]'' following the launch of the first volume of this catalogue of Islamic art. According to the article, suspicions in the art industry were that Khalili was assembling the collection on behalf of a rich investor. The release of the collection under his own name stopped those suspicions and showed Khalili's collection as belonging to himself and his family.<ref name=independent>{{cite web|last1=Norman|first1=Geraldine|title=Art Market: Mysterious gifts from the East: Who is the man who has collected Islam's finest treasures and offered them to Britain as a pounds 1bn bequest?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-market-mysterious-gifts-from-the-east-who-is-the-man-who-has-collected-islams-finest-treasures-1563284.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=12 December 1992}}</ref>\n\nDuring the same period, Khalili was an art advisor to [[Hassanal Bolkiah]], The Sultan of [[Brunei]].
