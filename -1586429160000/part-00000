The characters are engaged in the recovery of a cargo of [[pearl]]s from a shipwreck perilously close to the volcano.<ref>KRAKATOA - EAST OF JAVA\nMonthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 36, Iss. 420,  (Jan 1, 1969): 174. </ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1883, the [[volcano]] on the island of [[Krakatoa]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] begins to erupt, terrorizing the children at a mission school in [[Palembang]] on nearby [[Sumatra]].  \n\nMeanwhile, across the [[Sunda Strait]] at her [[home port]] of [[Anjer]] on the west coast of [[Java]], the [[Steamship|steamer]] ''Batavia Queen'', under the command of Captain Chris Hanson ([[Maximilian Schell]]), takes aboard passengers and cargo, including a [[diving bell]] and a [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]. Among the passengers coming aboard are Douglas Rigby ([[John Leyton]]), the designer, owner, and operator of the diving bell; Giovanni Borghese ([[Rossano Brazzi]]) and his son Leoncavallo ([[Sal Mineo]]), who own and operate the balloon as \"The Flying Borgheses;\" Harry Connerly ([[Brian Keith]]), a [[Underwater diving|diver]]; Connerly{{'}}s mistress Charley Adams ([[Barbara Werle]]), who is a professional [[soprano]] and former [[Bar (establishment)|saloon]] hostess; four female Japanese [[Pearl diving|pearl divers]] led by Toshi ([[Jacqui Chan]]); and Laura Travis ([[Diane Baker]]), a married woman who had an extramarital affair with Hanson in [[Jakarta|Batavia]].\n\nLaura was married to an abusive man with whom she had a son named Peter. Her husband did not want the marriage but also threatened to take Peter away from her if she asked for a divorce. Wanting to be with Hanson, she had asked for a divorce anyway, and her husband had left her, taking both Peter and a fortune in [[pearl]]s with him aboard the steamer ''Arianna''. The ''Arianna'' had sunk off Krakatoa during a storm, and a guilt-ridden Laura, fearing that Peter had died aboard the ''Arianna'' and blaming herself for his death, had spent a year in a [[mental institution]] before coming aboard the ''Batavia Queen''.\n\nHanson has organized the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s voyage to find the wreck of the ''Arianna'', [[Marine salvage|salvage]] the pearls, and determine Peter{{'}}s fate &ndash; and to find Peter if he is still alive. Hanson plans to use a variety of techniques to search for the wreck and salvage the pearls, with the Borgheses{{'}} balloon conducting an aerial search of shallow waters around Krakatoa, the pearl divers providing a mobile underwater search-and-salvage capability in shallow waters, Rigby in his diving bell searching in deeper water, and Connerly responsible both for recovering the pearls if they are in waters too deep for the pearl divers and for assisting in the heavy work of bringing the ''Arianna''{{'}}s [[safe]] to the surface. Colonial authorities arrive just before the ''Batavia Queen'' departs and force Hanson to take 30 convicts and their jailer aboard for transportation to [[Madura Island]], countering his argument that the ship is not equipped to accommodate them and has no room for them by telling him to transport the prisoners in the ship{{'}}s [[Hold (ship)|hold]] in appalling conditions. Hanson plans to deliver the convicts to Madura after recovering the pearls off Krakatoa.  One of the prisoners, Lester Danzig ([[J. D. Cannon]]), is an acquaintance of Hanson{{'}}s, and Hanson allows him to make the voyage on deck instead of in the hold. Aware that Krakatoa has begun to erupt and warned by a colonial official that the island is a \"raging volcano,\" Hanson replies that the volcano had been quiet for the previous 200 years and posed no threat now.\n\nDuring the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s voyage to Krakatoa, her crew and passengers observe strange phenomena: They see [[seabird]]s swarming in huge flocks by day, witness a series of fiery explosions erupting from the sea one evening, and hear a high-pitched, ear-splitting hissing and whistling sound like that of escaping [[steam]] on another night. During a conversation on deck one night, Danzig discovers that Connerly is using [[laudanum]] to kill the pain of a lung disease which he is keeping secret from Hanson because it might interfere with his diving abilities. Danzig informs Connerly of Laura's time in the mental institution, calling into question the veracity of her story about the pearls. The Borgheses, Connerly, Charley, Rigby, and Toshi confront Hanson about Laura's mental state, but Hanson assures them that Laura{{'}}s story about the ''Arianna'' is true. Connerly takes so much [[laudanum]] that he hallucinates one night, attacks one of the pearl divers, and assaults several crewmen coming to her aid before they can subdue him. On Hanson's orders, the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s crew suspends Connerly in a slatted box above the [[main deck]] so that he will pose no danger to others aboard the ship; Charley tearfully pleads with Hanson for Connerly's release, and Hanson relents and frees him. Meanwhile, Leoncavallo and Toshi take a romantic interest in one another.\n\nThe ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Krakatoa to find the island shrouded in thick smoke. It clears when she anchors off the island, and the Borgheses ascend in their balloon while Rigby descends in his diving bell. The Borgheses quickly discover the wreck of the ''Arianna'' and guide the ''Batavia Queen'' and the submerged Rigby to it. Immediately afterwards, the motor driving the [[propeller]] that allows them to steer their balloon fails and they careen helplessly over Krakatoa and into its active [[Volcanic crater|crater]]. They jettison the useless engine and propeller into the crater{{'}}s [[lava lake]] to reduce weight and finally are blown clear of the crater by a volcanic explosion which sets their balloon afire. They drift away from the island, leap into the sea, and are rescued, but the fire destroys the balloon.\n\nDanzig tells Hanson of Connerly{{'}}s lung problems, and Hanson decides that he will dive on the ''Arianna'' instead of Connerly. While Connerly and Hanson argue over this, Rigby{{'}}s diving bell becomes snagged on [[coral]]. The pearl divers, Hanson, and Connerly all dive into the water to free Rigby, and while they and the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s other passengers and crew are thus occupied, Danzig steals a pistol he finds in the ship{{'}}s chart room, knocks the jailer unconscious, and frees the prisoners. They take over the ship, throw the unconscious jailer overboard to drown, and imprison the passengers and crew in the hold, where they also place Rigby and the pearl divers when they return to the ''Batavia Queen''. Before returning, and unaware of the turn of events aboard the ''Batavia Queen'', Hanson and Connerly swim to the wreck of the ''Arianna'', find the ship{{'}}s safe, and attach a cable to it to have it hoisted aboard the ''Batavia Queen''. Upon their return, Danzig has Connerly lowered into the hold but forces Hanson to look on at gunpoint as he opens the ''Arianna''{{'}}s safe on the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s deck. They find nothing in the safe but a cheap [[pocket watch]]. When an explosion on Krakatoa distracts Danzig, Hanson overpowers him, takes the pistol from him, pushes the heavy safe over onto one convict, shoots two others, and uses steam from a hose to force the rest of the prisoners to jump overboard. They swim to nearby Krakatoa, never to be seen again.\n\nAfter Hanson frees the passengers and crew from the hold, Rigby finds another compartment in the safe which contains the ''Arianna''{{'}}s [[logbook]]. Laura and Hanson examine the logbook for clues about Peter{{'}}s fate. The logbook reveals that the ''Arianna'' made a last port call at Palembang before sinking, and a letter tucked into the logbook says that Peter disembarked there to attend the mission school. Hanson decides to steam to Palembang to find Peter. By now, Krakatoa is erupting continually, and the volcano{{'}}s explosions begin to hurl [[lava bomb]]s into the surrounding sea. A number of them strike the ''Batavia Queen'' as she gets underway for Palembang, starting fires which the crew puts out. As Toshi runs across the deck toward Leoncavallo, one of the lava bombs strikes and kills her.\n\nThe ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Palembang to find the mission school heavily damaged, burning, and abandoned. Hanson hails a passing [[Junk (ship)|junk]], and someone aboard the junk tells him that the staff and students of the school all are alive and had fled Palembang that morning aboard another boat, intending to sail to Java. The ''Batavia Queen'' soon comes to the assistance of an overcrowded and sinking [[sampan]], which proves to be the school{{'}}s boat. The ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s passengers and crew rescue everyone aboard the sampan, including Peter, who has a joyful reunion with Laura. A chest belonging to Peter comes aboard the ''Batavia Queen'' during the rescue; it contains the pearls, and Connerly, Rigby, the Borgheses, and the three surviving pearl divers receive their shares of the fortune.\n\nKrakatoa{{'}}s violent explosions become larger and continuous; Hanson assumes that they will generate a [[tsunami]] and begins to prepare the ''Batavia Queen'' to ride it out. Although Hanson assures him that a tsunami will destroy nearby Anjer and that he is safer at sea aboard the ''Batavia Queen'' if she can get to deep water in time, Connerly disputes the ship{{'}}s ability to survive and demands that Hanson allow those who wish to go ashore to row to Anjer with him in one of the ship{{'}}s [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. Giovanni Borghese, Charley, and the three surviving pearl divers all join Connerly in the lifeboat and row to Anjer.\n\nKrakatoa disintegrates in one final, cataclysmic explosion, which generates an enormous tsunami. It strikes Anjer shortly after the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s lifeboat arrives there; unable to outrun the wave, Connerly and Charley embrace for the last time before the wave engulfs and kills them. At sea, Hanson, Laura, Peter, Rigby, Leoncavallo Borghese, the refugees from the mission school, and the ship's crew ride out the tsunami successfully aboard the ''Batavia Queen''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Maximilian Schell]] as Captain Chris Hanson\n* [[Diane Baker]] as Laura Travis\n* [[Brian Keith]] as Harry Connerly\n* [[Sal Mineo]] as Leoncavallo Borghese\n* [[Rossano Brazzi]] as Giovanni Borghese\n* [[John Leyton]] as Douglas Rigby\n* [[J.D.

Cineaste; New York Vol. 22, Iss. 4,  (1997): 68.</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\nIn an unusual approach to making the film, the producers of ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' had the [[special effects]] scenes shot before the script had been completed. The script then was written so as to incorporate the special effects sequences.<ref name=\"model ships\">[http://modelshipsinthecinema.com/wp/archives/548 Model Ships in the Cinema: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', 1969, including quotes from Louri\u00e9, Eugene, ''My Work in Films'', Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985] {{ISBN|0-15-662342-0}}.</ref>\n\nThe French [[film director]], [[art director]], [[production designer]], [[set designer]], and [[screenwriter]] [[Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9]] had worked for the film's producers as art and special-effects director for the 1965 movie ''[[Crack in the World]]'', and they hired him to create the special effects for ''Krakatoa, East of Java''. \n\nIn 1965, Louri\u00e9 scouted the coast of [[Spain]] for a suitable steamer for use in the film as the fictional ''Batavia Queen''; ultimately he chose a [[cargo ship]] &ndash; a former [[passenger-cargo ship]] employed as a [[tramp steamer]] between Spain and [[Morocco]] &ndash; he found unloading [[coal]] at a pier in [[Bilbao]] whose captain said she had been built in [[England]] sometime around 1880. \n\nLouri\u00e9 had the steamer remodeled in [[M\u00e1laga]], Spain, at a [[shipyard]] which transformed her into the ''Batavia Queen'' by increasing the height of her [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]] and [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and installing new [[Yard (sailing)|yards]] on her masts and a new [[bowsprit]] and carved wooden [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]] on her [[Bow (ship)|bow]]. The steamer also was provided with functioning [[sail]]s for her masts and yards.<ref name=\"model ships\"/>\n\nFor special effects, Louri\u00e9's team constructed two models of the modified steamer, a one-to-ten-scale model that was 18 feet (5.5 meters) long, and, for long shots of the ''Batavia Queen'' as she approaches Krakatoa, a one-to-twenty-scale model. The latter proved too small to provide realistic effects, so Louri\u00e9 chose not to use it in the film, instead using only the larger model.<ref name=\"model ships\"/>\n\nAfter considering a [[water tank]] in [[Malta]], Louri\u00e9 chose the water tank he had used for the 1964 film ''[[Flight from Ashiya]]'' at [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] in [[Rome]] to film special effects sequences depicting the ''Batavia Queen'' at sea. The tank was approximately 300 by 400 feet (91 by 122 meters) in area and had a sky backing of 70 feet (21 meters). The sequences were filmed using three [[Super Panavision 70]] cameras running at three times normal speed to make the movements of the miniatures more realistic, although the cameras were not designed for such work and often overheated and required repairs. Louri\u00e9 tried to disguise the miniature ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s lack of a crew or passengers as she gets underway for Palembang, slowly picking her way through a narrow passage under a rain of lava bombs while Krakatoa erupts nearby, by enveloping her in smoke. For the final sequence in which the ''Batavia Queen'' rides out a very large tsunami at sea, Louri\u00e9's team spent three days filming the model in the water tank in extreme conditions, creating large waves through the use of 35-foot (10.6-meter) dump tanks with a capacity of 2,600 gallons (9,842 liters),<ref name=\"metric\" group=\"note\">The source does not specify the type of [[gallon]] it uses. This [[Metric system|metric]] conversion from [[English units]] assumes that the English unit used is the [[Gallon#The US liquid gallon|United States liquid gallon]].

Scenes of the volcano erupting in the distance were created using a [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]], with real footage of the ocean in the lower part of the frame and a flopped volcano miniature reflection added above it in an optical printer.<ref name=\"pyrotechnics\">[http://modelshipsinthecinema.com/wp/archives/548 Model Ships in the Cinema: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' (caption for still from movie showing miniature volcano erupting across the ocean)]</ref>\n\nThe visual effects, relying entirely on in-camera model work, are still impressive today and considered an immense achievement by 1969 standards, enough so for it to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]]. It lost to ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]''.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nLouri\u00e9 himself makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', portraying a [[lighthouse]] keeper on the coast of Java who observes Krakatoa's final, cataclysmic explosion and enters the lighthouse to send news of it by [[telegraph]].<ref name=\"cameo\">[http://modelshipsinthecinema.com/wp/archives/548 Model Ships in the Cinema: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' (caption for photograph of lighthouse keeper operating telegraph)]</ref>\n\n===Yordan's Departure===\nIn addition to its challenging special effects, the makers of ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' encountered various difficulties during the film's production. Producer [[Philip Yordan]] dropped out of the production after its special effects had already been shot, and a new associate producer came on board who commissioned a new script.<ref name=\"tcm\">[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/152598%7C0/Krakatoa-East-of-Java.html TCM Film Article: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'']</ref> \n\nThese changes in leadership led to conceptual changes that created some inconsistency in tone and odd moments in the finished film.<ref name=\"tcm\"/> While apparently conceiving ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' overall as a family-friendly adventure story, the producers also opted to attract a more adult audience by including some sordid and racy elements: the tortured relationship between Connerly and Charley and Laura's extramarital affair with Hanson, as well as a [[striptease]] Charley performs for Connerly in their [[state room]].<ref name=\"tcm\"/> \n\nAt other times, the movie{{'}}s soundtrack is clumsily incorporated into the narrative: while performing her striptease, Charley sings a rendition of \"A Nice Old-Fashioned Girl\" that would be appropriate in a [[Musical film|musical]] but seems strangely out of place in an adventure or disaster film, and the vocal version of the movie{{'}}s romantic theme song \"East of Java\" incongruously plays during scenes of filthy prisoners shuffling into the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s hold and sweating sailors performing the labor necessary to get the ship out to sea as she begins her voyage from Anjer.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nKowalski said \"We had more than our share of problems because you can't control such varying conditions as weather, sea, children and animals.  But nearly everyone bore up under very trying circumstances. My life was only threatened four times.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nKowalski added that \"the tendency  in Cinerama has been to employ wide-angle shots that show everybody in the scene. I'm not doing that. I'm cutting quickly from one shot to another so things happen. I'm also devoting much care to the characters. I think if you have a bunch of people that the audience cares about, then you can build up the big scenic effects with no difficulty.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\n===Title===\nDuring production of ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', its producers became aware that Krakatoa is, in fact, west of Java &ndash; and east of Sumatra. ([[Mount Tambora]], on [[Sumbawa]], much less well known than Krakatoa despite its own &ndash; and even larger &ndash; cataclysmic explosion in 1815, is the violent volcano east of Java.) Despite the geographic error in the film's title, its makers chose to leave it unchanged, apparently believing that it was a more exotic title than \"''Krakatoa, West of Java''.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Furthermore, the film aided in popularizing [[Krakatoa#Etymology|the spelling \"Krakatoa\"]], as opposed to the Indonesian spelling \"Krakatau.\"\n\n===Film format===\n''Krakatoa, East of Java'' was filmed in Super Panavision 70 (with some scenes filmed in [[Todd-AO]]), and presented in [[70 mm film|70&nbsp;mm]] [[Cinerama]] in some cinemas. Appearing in cinemas as interest in Cinerama's widescreen format waned, it is the only disaster movie ever to appear in the format.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\n===Novelization===\n[[Michael Avallone]] wrote a novelization of the movie with the same title.\n\n==Historical inaccuracy==\n\nThe catastrophic [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]]  destroyed most of the uninhabited island and generated tsunamis exceeding 30 meters (100 feet) in height that struck the western coast of Java and southern coast of Sumatra, killing about 35,000 people, while a [[pyroclastic flow]] from the volcano that traveled across the Sunda Strait killed about another 1,000 people on Sumatra.<ref>[http://www.vansandick.com/familie/links/vulcaan2.php#h2 vansandick.com TsuInfo Alert: The eruption of Krakatoa]</ref> ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' is only very loosely based on the actual events surrounding the eruption, which it uses merely as a backdrop for its storyline.\n\nHanson{{'}}s statement early in the film that Krakatoa had been quiet for 200 years is accurate &ndash; the last eruption prior to 1883 appears to have been in 1680<ref>[[Simon Winchester|Winchester, Simon]], ''[[Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded, August 27, 1883]]'', New York: HarperCollins, 2003, {{ISBN|0-06-621285-5}}, pp. 132-136.</ref> &ndash; and his view that the ongoing volcanic activity on the island, which had begun in May 1883, did not pose a threat to anyone not actually on Krakatoa itself reflected the attitude of many people in the area during the summer of 1883, some of whom treated the erupting volcano as a tourist attraction.<ref>Winchester, Simon, ''Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded, August 27, 1883'', New York: HarperCollins, 2003, {{ISBN|0-06-621285-5}}, pp. 167-176.</ref>\n\nKrakatoa is actually located west, not east, of Java.\n\nThe ''Batavia Queen'' appears to require at least three days to make the voyage from Anjer to Krakatoa.

Late in the film, when the ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Palembang in search of Peter Travis, Palembang appears to be along the coast of Sumatra; however, Palembang, while accessible to ships via the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]], lies well inland. The ''Batavia Queen'' finds the mission school in ruins and ablaze because of Krakatoa's eruption; although Krakatoa's eruption was audible in Palembang and the air pressure wave from its final explosion was strong enough to shake the walls of houses and cause cracks to appear in some, the town did not suffer the serious damage implied by the condition of the mission school in the film.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OXcCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&q=Palembang%20Krakatoa Anonymous, ''Nature: A Weekly Illustrated Journal of Science, Volume XXX, May 1884 to October 1884'', New York: McMillan and Company, 1884, p. 12.]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vk8PAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA483&lpg=PA483&q=Palembang%20Krakatoa Symons, G.

The characters are engaged in the recovery of a cargo of [[pearl]]s from a shipwreck perilously close to the volcano.<ref>KRAKATOA - EAST OF JAVA\nMonthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 36, Iss. 420,  (Jan 1, 1969): 174. </ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn 1883, the [[volcano]] on the island of [[Krakatoa]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] begins to erupt, terrorizing the children at a mission school in [[Palembang]] on nearby [[Sumatra]].  \n\nMeanwhile, across the [[Sunda Strait]] at her [[home port]] of [[Anjer]] on the west coast of [[Java]], the [[Steamship|steamer]] ''Batavia Queen'', under the command of Captain Chris Hanson ([[Maximilian Schell]]), takes aboard passengers and cargo, including a [[diving bell]] and a [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]. Among the passengers coming aboard are Douglas Rigby ([[John Leyton]]), the designer, owner, and operator of the diving bell; Giovanni Borghese ([[Rossano Brazzi]]) and his son Leoncavallo ([[Sal Mineo]]), who own and operate the balloon as \"The Flying Borgheses;\" Harry Connerly ([[Brian Keith]]), a [[Underwater diving|diver]]; Connerly{{'}}s mistress Charley Adams ([[Barbara Werle]]), who is a professional [[soprano]] and former [[Bar (establishment)|saloon]] hostess; four female Japanese [[Pearl diving|pearl divers]] led by Toshi ([[Jacqui Chan]]); and Laura Travis ([[Diane Baker]]), a married woman who had an extramarital affair with Hanson in [[Jakarta|Batavia]].\n\nLaura was married to an abusive man with whom she had a son named Peter. Her husband did not want the marriage but also threatened to take Peter away from her if she asked for a divorce. Wanting to be with Hanson, she had asked for a divorce anyway, and her husband had left her, taking both Peter and a fortune in [[pearl]]s with him aboard the steamer ''Arianna''. The ''Arianna'' had sunk off Krakatoa during a storm, and a guilt-ridden Laura, fearing that Peter had died aboard the ''Arianna'' and blaming herself for his death, had spent a year in a [[mental institution]] before coming aboard the ''Batavia Queen''.\n\nHanson has organized the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s voyage to find the wreck of the ''Arianna'', [[Marine salvage|salvage]] the pearls, and determine Peter{{'}}s fate &ndash; and to find Peter if he is still alive. Hanson plans to use a variety of techniques to search for the wreck and salvage the pearls, with the Borgheses{{'}} balloon conducting an aerial search of shallow waters around Krakatoa, the pearl divers providing a mobile underwater search-and-salvage capability in shallow waters, Rigby in his diving bell searching in deeper water, and Connerly responsible both for recovering the pearls if they are in waters too deep for the pearl divers and for assisting in the heavy work of bringing the ''Arianna''{{'}}s [[safe]] to the surface. Colonial authorities arrive just before the ''Batavia Queen'' departs and force Hanson to take 30 convicts and their jailer aboard for transportation to [[Madura Island]], countering his argument that the ship is not equipped to accommodate them and has no room for them by telling him to transport the prisoners in the ship{{'}}s [[Hold (ship)|hold]] in appalling conditions. Hanson plans to deliver the convicts to Madura after recovering the pearls off Krakatoa.  One of the prisoners, Lester Danzig ([[J. D. Cannon]]), is an acquaintance of Hanson{{'}}s, and Hanson allows him to make the voyage on deck instead of in the hold. Aware that Krakatoa has begun to erupt and warned by a colonial official that the island is a \"raging volcano,\" Hanson replies that the volcano had been quiet for the previous 200 years and posed no threat now.\n\nDuring the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s voyage to Krakatoa, her crew and passengers observe strange phenomena: They see [[seabird]]s swarming in huge flocks by day, witness a series of fiery explosions erupting from the sea one evening, and hear a high-pitched, ear-splitting hissing and whistling sound like that of escaping [[steam]] on another night. During a conversation on deck one night, Danzig discovers that Connerly is using [[laudanum]] to kill the pain of a lung disease which he is keeping secret from Hanson because it might interfere with his diving abilities. Danzig informs Connerly of Laura's time in the mental institution, calling into question the veracity of her story about the pearls. The Borgheses, Connerly, Charley, Rigby, and Toshi confront Hanson about Laura's mental state, but Hanson assures them that Laura{{'}}s story about the ''Arianna'' is true. Connerly takes so much [[laudanum]] that he hallucinates one night, attacks one of the pearl divers, and assaults several crewmen coming to her aid before they can subdue him. On Hanson's orders, the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s crew suspends Connerly in a slatted box above the [[main deck]] so that he will pose no danger to others aboard the ship; Charley tearfully pleads with Hanson for Connerly's release, and Hanson relents and frees him. Meanwhile, Leoncavallo and Toshi take a romantic interest in one another.\n\nThe ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Krakatoa to find the island shrouded in thick smoke. It clears when she anchors off the island, and the Borgheses ascend in their balloon while Rigby descends in his diving bell. The Borgheses quickly discover the wreck of the ''Arianna'' and guide the ''Batavia Queen'' and the submerged Rigby to it. Immediately afterwards, the motor driving the [[propeller]] that allows them to steer their balloon fails and they careen helplessly over Krakatoa and into its active [[Volcanic crater|crater]]. They jettison the useless engine and propeller into the crater{{'}}s [[lava lake]] to reduce weight and finally are blown clear of the crater by a volcanic explosion which sets their balloon afire. They drift away from the island, leap into the sea, and are rescued, but the fire destroys the balloon.\n\nDanzig tells Hanson of Connerly{{'}}s lung problems, and Hanson decides that he will dive on the ''Arianna'' instead of Connerly. While Connerly and Hanson argue over this, Rigby{{'}}s diving bell becomes snagged on [[coral]]. The pearl divers, Hanson, and Connerly all dive into the water to free Rigby, and while they and the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s other passengers and crew are thus occupied, Danzig steals a pistol he finds in the ship{{'}}s chart room, knocks the jailer unconscious, and frees the prisoners. They take over the ship, throw the unconscious jailer overboard to drown, and imprison the passengers and crew in the hold, where they also place Rigby and the pearl divers when they return to the ''Batavia Queen''. Before returning, and unaware of the turn of events aboard the ''Batavia Queen'', Hanson and Connerly swim to the wreck of the ''Arianna'', find the ship{{'}}s safe, and attach a cable to it to have it hoisted aboard the ''Batavia Queen''. Upon their return, Danzig has Connerly lowered into the hold but forces Hanson to look on at gunpoint as he opens the ''Arianna''{{'}}s safe on the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s deck. They find nothing in the safe but a cheap [[pocket watch]]. When an explosion on Krakatoa distracts Danzig, Hanson overpowers him, takes the pistol from him, pushes the heavy safe over onto one convict, shoots two others, and uses steam from a hose to force the rest of the prisoners to jump overboard. They swim to nearby Krakatoa, never to be seen again.\n\nAfter Hanson frees the passengers and crew from the hold, Rigby finds another compartment in the safe which contains the ''Arianna''{{'}}s [[logbook]]. Laura and Hanson examine the logbook for clues about Peter{{'}}s fate. The logbook reveals that the ''Arianna'' made a last port call at Palembang before sinking, and a letter tucked into the logbook says that Peter disembarked there to attend the mission school. Hanson decides to steam to Palembang to find Peter. By now, Krakatoa is erupting continually, and the volcano{{'}}s explosions begin to hurl [[lava bomb]]s into the surrounding sea. A number of them strike the ''Batavia Queen'' as she gets underway for Palembang, starting fires which the crew puts out. As Toshi runs across the deck toward Leoncavallo, one of the lava bombs strikes and kills her.\n\nThe ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Palembang to find the mission school heavily damaged, burning, and abandoned. Hanson hails a passing [[Junk (ship)|junk]], and someone aboard the junk tells him that the staff and students of the school all are alive and had fled Palembang that morning aboard another boat, intending to sail to Java. The ''Batavia Queen'' soon comes to the assistance of an overcrowded and sinking [[sampan]], which proves to be the school{{'}}s boat. The ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s passengers and crew rescue everyone aboard the sampan, including Peter, who has a joyful reunion with Laura. A chest belonging to Peter comes aboard the ''Batavia Queen'' during the rescue; it contains the pearls, and Connerly, Rigby, the Borgheses, and the three surviving pearl divers receive their shares of the fortune.\n\nKrakatoa{{'}}s violent explosions become larger and continuous; Hanson assumes that they will generate a [[tsunami]] and begins to prepare the ''Batavia Queen'' to ride it out. Although Hanson assures him that a tsunami will destroy nearby Anjer and that he is safer at sea aboard the ''Batavia Queen'' if she can get to deep water in time, Connerly disputes the ship{{'}}s ability to survive and demands that Hanson allow those who wish to go ashore to row to Anjer with him in one of the ship{{'}}s [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. Giovanni Borghese, Charley, and the three surviving pearl divers all join Connerly in the lifeboat and row to Anjer.\n\nKrakatoa disintegrates in one final, cataclysmic explosion, which generates an enormous tsunami. It strikes Anjer shortly after the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s lifeboat arrives there; unable to outrun the wave, Connerly and Charley embrace for the last time before the wave engulfs and kills them. At sea, Hanson, Laura, Peter, Rigby, Leoncavallo Borghese, the refugees from the mission school, and the ship's crew ride out the tsunami successfully aboard the ''Batavia Queen''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Maximilian Schell]] as Captain Chris Hanson\n* [[Diane Baker]] as Laura Travis\n* [[Brian Keith]] as Harry Connerly\n* [[Sal Mineo]] as Leoncavallo Borghese\n* [[Rossano Brazzi]] as Giovanni Borghese\n* [[John Leyton]] as Douglas Rigby\n* [[J.D.

The script then was written so as to incorporate the special effects sequences.<ref name=\"model ships\">[http://modelshipsinthecinema.com/wp/archives/548 Model Ships in the Cinema: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', 1969, including quotes from Louri\u00e9, Eugene, ''My Work in Films'', Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985] {{ISBN|0-15-662342-0}}.</ref>\n\nThe French [[film director]], [[art director]], [[production designer]], [[set designer]], and [[screenwriter]] [[Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9]] had worked for the film's producers as art and special-effects director for the 1965 movie ''[[Crack in the World]]'', and they hired him to create the special effects for ''Krakatoa, East of Java''. \n\nIn 1965, Louri\u00e9 scouted the coast of [[Spain]] for a suitable steamer for use in the film as the fictional ''Batavia Queen''; ultimately he chose a [[cargo ship]] &ndash; a former [[passenger-cargo ship]] employed as a [[tramp steamer]] between Spain and [[Morocco]] &ndash; he found unloading [[coal]] at a pier in [[Bilbao]] whose captain said she had been built in [[England]] sometime around 1880. \n\nLouri\u00e9 had the steamer remodeled in [[M\u00e1laga]], Spain, at a [[shipyard]] which transformed her into the ''Batavia Queen'' by increasing the height of her [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]] and [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and installing new [[Yard (sailing)|yards]] on her masts and a new [[bowsprit]] and carved wooden [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]] on her [[Bow (ship)|bow]]. The steamer also was provided with functioning [[sail]]s for her masts and yards.<ref name=\"model ships\"/>\n\nFor special effects, Louri\u00e9's team constructed two models of the modified steamer, a one-to-ten-scale model that was 18 feet (5.5 meters) long, and, for long shots of the ''Batavia Queen'' as she approaches Krakatoa, a one-to-twenty-scale model. The latter proved too small to provide realistic effects, so Louri\u00e9 chose not to use it in the film, instead using only the larger model.<ref name=\"model ships\"/>\n\nAfter considering a [[water tank]] in [[Malta]], Louri\u00e9 chose the water tank he had used for the 1964 film ''[[Flight from Ashiya]]'' at [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] in [[Rome]] to film special effects sequences depicting the ''Batavia Queen'' at sea. The tank was approximately 300 by 400 feet (91 by 122 meters) in area and had a sky backing of 70 feet (21 meters). The sequences were filmed using three [[Super Panavision 70]] cameras running at three times normal speed to make the movements of the miniatures more realistic, although the cameras were not designed for such work and often overheated and required repairs. Louri\u00e9 tried to disguise the miniature ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s lack of a crew or passengers as she gets underway for Palembang, slowly picking her way through a narrow passage under a rain of lava bombs while Krakatoa erupts nearby, by enveloping her in smoke. For the final sequence in which the ''Batavia Queen'' rides out a very large tsunami at sea, Louri\u00e9's team spent three days filming the model in the water tank in extreme conditions, creating large waves through the use of 35-foot (10.6-meter) dump tanks with a capacity of 2,600 gallons (9,842 liters),<ref name=\"metric\" group=\"note\">The source does not specify the type of [[gallon]] it uses. This [[Metric system|metric]] conversion from [[English units]] assumes that the English unit used is the [[Gallon#The US liquid gallon|United States liquid gallon]].

It lost to ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]''.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nLouri\u00e9 himself makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', portraying a [[lighthouse]] keeper on the coast of Java who observes Krakatoa's final, cataclysmic explosion and enters the lighthouse to send news of it by [[telegraph]].<ref name=\"cameo\">[http://modelshipsinthecinema.com/wp/archives/548 Model Ships in the Cinema: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' (caption for photograph of lighthouse keeper operating telegraph)]</ref>\n\n===Yordan's Departure===\nIn addition to its challenging special effects, the makers of ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' encountered various difficulties during the film's production. Producer [[Philip Yordan]] dropped out of the production after its special effects had already been shot, and a new associate producer came on board who commissioned a new script.<ref name=\"tcm\">[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/152598%7C0/Krakatoa-East-of-Java.html TCM Film Article: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'']</ref> \n\nThese changes in leadership led to conceptual changes that created some inconsistency in tone and odd moments in the finished film.<ref name=\"tcm\"/> While apparently conceiving ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' overall as a family-friendly adventure story, the producers also opted to attract a more adult audience by including some sordid and racy elements: the tortured relationship between Connerly and Charley and Laura's extramarital affair with Hanson, as well as a [[striptease]] Charley performs for Connerly in their [[state room]].<ref name=\"tcm\"/> \n\nAt other times, the movie{{'}}s soundtrack is clumsily incorporated into the narrative: while performing her striptease, Charley sings a rendition of \"A Nice Old-Fashioned Girl\" that would be appropriate in a [[Musical film|musical]] but seems strangely out of place in an adventure or disaster film, and the vocal version of the movie{{'}}s romantic theme song \"East of Java\" incongruously plays during scenes of filthy prisoners shuffling into the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s hold and sweating sailors performing the labor necessary to get the ship out to sea as she begins her voyage from Anjer.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nKowalski said \"We had more than our share of problems because you can't control such varying conditions as weather, sea, children and animals.  But nearly everyone bore up under very trying circumstances. My life was only threatened four times.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nKowalski added that \"the tendency  in Cinerama has been to employ wide-angle shots that show everybody in the scene. I'm not doing that. I'm cutting quickly from one shot to another so things happen. I'm also devoting much care to the characters. I think if you have a bunch of people that the audience cares about, then you can build up the big scenic effects with no difficulty.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\n===Title===\nDuring production of ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', its producers became aware that Krakatoa is, in fact, west of Java &ndash; and east of Sumatra.

This kind of respirator is reusable, with the filters being replaced periodically.]]\n\nA '''respirator''' is a device designed to protect the wearer from inhaling hazardous atmospheres, including [[wikt:fumes|fumes]], [[vapor|vapours]], [[gases]] and [[particulate matter]] such as dusts and airborne [[microorganisms]]. There are two main categories: the ''air-purifying respirator'', in which respirable air is obtained by filtering a contaminated atmosphere, and the ''air-supplied respirator'', in which an alternate supply of breathable air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contaminants.\n\nAir-purifying respirators range from relatively inexpensive single-use, disposable face masks sometimes referred to as a [[dust mask]] to more robust reusable models with replaceable cartridges often called a [[gas mask]].\n\n==Physical form==\nAll respirators have some type of facepiece held to the wearer's head with straps, a cloth harness, or some other method.  Facepieces come in many different styles and sizes, to accommodate all types of face shapes. The differences in respirator design impact the [[respirator assigned protection factors]], i.e. the resulting degree of protection from which kind of hazard.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThere are three categories of particulate respirators: particulate-filtering facepiece respirators are discarded when they become unsuitable for further use due to considerations of hygiene, excessive resistance, or physical damage; elastomeric respirators are reusable because the facepiece is cleaned and reused, but the filter cartridges are discarded and replaced when they become unsuitable for further use; and [[Powered air-purifying respirator|powered air-purifying respirators]] have a battery-powered blower that moves the airflow through the filters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource1quest1.html|title=Respirator Trusted-Source Information: What are they?|last=|first=|date=2018-01-29|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nRespirators can have half-face forms that cover the bottom half of the face including the nose and mouth, and full-face forms that cover the entire face. Half-face respirators should only be worn in environments where the contaminants are not toxic to the eyes or facial area. For example, someone who is spray painting could wear a half-face respirator, but someone who works with [[chlorine]] gas would have to wear a full-face respirator.\n\n== Types of filtration ==\n\n=== Air-purifying ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Personal protective equipment]] -->\n[[File:Police officer wearing half-mask respirator.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Protective P100 filter mask worn by NYPD officer]]\nAir-purifying respirators are used against particulates, gases, and vapors that are at atmospheric concentrations less than immediately dangerous to life and health. This includes:\n\n*[[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative-pressure]] respirators using mechanical filters and chemical media\n*[[positive pressure|positive-pressure]] units such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)\n*Escape Only respirators or hoods such as Air-Purifying Escape Respirators for use by the general public for [[chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear]]  (CBRN) terrorism incidents.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFull hood, half- or full-facepiece designs are marketed in many varieties depending on the hazard of concern using an [[air filter]] which acts passively on air inhaled by the wearer. Two common examples of this type of respirator are single-use escape hoods and filter masks. The latter are typically simple, light, single-piece, half-face masks and employ the first three mechanical filter mechanisms in the list below to remove particulates from the air stream.  The most common of these is the disposable white N95 variety. It is discarded after single use or some extended period depending on the contaminant. Filter masks also come in replaceable-cartridge, multiple-use models. Typically one or two cartridges attach securely to a mask which has built into it a corresponding number of valves for inhalation and one for exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) and the [[International Safety Equipment Association]] (ISEA) established the American National Standard for Air-Purifying Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices to define both test criteria and approval methods for fire/smoke escape hoods. ANSI/ISEA Standard 110 provides design guidance to manufacturers of Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices (RPED) in the form of performance requirements and testing procedures. The standard covers certification, ISO registration for the manufacturer, associated test methods, labeling, conditioning requirements, independent process and quality control audits, and follow-up inspection programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://safetyequipment.org/c/std110-2009.cfm |title=International Safety Equipment Association |publisher=Safetyequipment.org |accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> ANSI/ISEA 110 was prepared by members of the ISEA RPED group, in consultation with testing laboratories and was reviewed by a consensus panel representing users, health and safety professionals and government representatives.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission uses ANSI/ISEA 110 as the benchmark in their testing of fire escape masks.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n====Mechanical filter====\n{{Main|Mechanical filter respirator}}\n[[File:Atemluftfilter Einwegmaske.jpg|thumb|Filtering half mask with exhalation valve (class: FFP3)]]\n\n[[File:What it Means to be NIOSH-Approved - A look into N95 Certification Testing.webm|thumb|right|300px|A video describing N95 certification testing]]Mechanical filter respirators retain particulate matter such as dust created during [[woodwork]]ing or metal processing, when contaminated air is passed through the filter material. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nMechanical filters remove contaminants from air in several ways: ''interception'' when particles following a line of flow in the airstream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it; ''impaction'', when larger particles unable to follow the curving contours of the airstream are forced to embed in one of the fibers directly; this increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity; by ''diffusion'', where gas molecules collide with the smallest particles, especially those below 100&nbsp;nm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter, increasing the probability that particles will be stopped by either of the previous two mechanisms; and by using certain resins, waxes, and plastics as coatings on the filter material to attract particles with an [[electrostatic charge]] that holds them on the filter surface.\n\nThere are many different filtration standards that vary by jurisdiction.  In the [[United States]], the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] defines the categories of particulate filters according to their [[NIOSH air filtration rating]].  The most common of these are the [[N95 mask]], which filters at least 95% of [[airborne particles]] but is not resistant to [[oil]].  Other categories filter 99% or 99.97% of particles, or have varying degrees of resistance to oil.<ref name=\"fact sheet\">{{cite journal| last1 = Metzler | first1 = R| last2 = Szalajda | first2 = J | title = NIOSH Fact Sheet: NIOSH Approval Labels - Key Information to Protect Yourself | journal = DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2011-179 | year = 2011 | url =https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-179/pdfs/2011-179.pdf | issn =0343-6993}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[European Union]], [[European standard]] EN 143 defines the 'P' classes of particle filters that can be attached to a face mask, while European standard EN 149 defines classes of \"filtering half masks\" or \"filtering face pieces\" ([[FFP mask|FFP masks]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAccording to [[3M]], respirators made according to the following standards from other countries are equivalent to U.S. N95 or European FFP2 respirators include the Chinese KN95, Australian / New Zealand P2, Korean 1st Class also referred to as KF94, and Japanese DS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1791500O/comparison-ffp2-kn95-n95-filtering-facepiece-respirator-classes-tb.pdf|title=Technical Bulletin: Comparison of FFP2, KN95, and N95 and Other Filtering Facepiece Respirator Classes|last=|first=|date=January 2020|website=|publisher=3M Personal Safety Division|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n====Chemical cartridge====\n[[File:Respirator canister with ESLI for asid gases -1.JPG|thumb|Combined gas and particulate respirator filter for protection against acid gases, the type of BKF (\u0411\u041a\u0424).

A typical [[organic compound|organic]] vapor respirator cartridge is a metal or plastic case containing from 25 to 40&nbsp;grams of sorption media such as [[activated charcoal]] or certain [[resin]]s.  The service life of the cartridge varies based, among other variables, on the carbon weight and molecular weight of the vapor and the cartridge media, the concentration of vapor in the atmosphere, the relative humidity of the atmosphere, and the breathing rate of the respirator wearer.  When filter cartridges become [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]]{{dn|date=February 2020}} or particulate accumulation within them begins to restrict air flow, they must be changed.<ref name=\"CartridgesReplacement\">[[:File:Methods for the timely replacement of cartridges in respirators.pdf|The document describes the methods used previously and currently used to perform the timely replacement of cartridges in air purifying respirators.]]</ref>\n\nIf the concentration of harmful gases is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life or health]], in workplaces covered by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] the US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] specifies the use of air-supplied respirators except when intended solely for escape during emergencies.<ref name=\"Standard\">OSHA standard [http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=12716 29 CFR 1910.134] \"Respiratory Protection\"</ref> [[NIOSH]] also discourages their use under such conditions.<ref name=\"\u0423\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a-\u043f\u043e-\u0432\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0443-2004\">{{cite book|last=Bollinger|first=Nancy|title=NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2005-100/|series=DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2005-100|year=2004|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|pages=32|display-authors=etal|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2005100}}</ref>\n\n====Powered air-purifying respirators====\n{{Main|Powered air-purifying respirator}}\n\nPowered air-purifying respirator (PAPRs) take [[contaminate]]d air, remove a certain quantity of pollutants and return the air to the user. There are different units for different environments. The units consist of a powered [[fan (mechanical)|fan]] which forces incoming air through one or more [[filter (air)|filter]]s to the user for breathing. The fan and filters may be carried by the user or they may be remotely mounted and the user breathes the air through tubing.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe filter type must be matched to the contaminants that need to be removed. Some PAPR's are designed to remove fine particulate matter, while others are suitable for working with [[volatile organic compound]]s as those in [[spray paint]]s. These must have their filter elements replaced more often than a particulate filter.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)===\n{{Main|Self-contained breathing apparatus}}\n\nA self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) typically has three main components: a high-pressure air cylinder (e.g., 2200 psi to 4500 psi), a pressure gauge and regulator, and an inhalation connection (mouthpiece, mouth mask or full face mask), connected together and mounted to a carrying frame or a harness with adjustable shoulder straps and belt so it can be worn on the back. There are two kinds of SCBA: open circuit and closed circuit. Most modern SCBAs are open-circuit. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOpen-circuit industrial breathing sets are filled with filtered, compressed air. The compressed air passes through a regulator, is inhaled and exhaled out of the circuit, quickly depleting the supply of air. Air cylinders are made of aluminum, steel, or of a composite construction like fiberglass-wrapped aluminum. The \"positive pressure\" type is common, which supplies a steady stream of air to stop fumes or smoke from leaking into the mask. Other SCBA's are of the \"demand\" type, which only supply air when the regulator senses the user inhaling. All fire departments and those working in toxic environments use the positive pressure SCBA for safety reasons.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe closed-circuit type SCBA filters, supplements, and recirculates exhaled gas like a [[rebreather]]. It is used when a longer-duration supply of breathing gas is needed, such as in mine rescue and in long tunnels, and going through passages too narrow for a large open-circuit air cylinder.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== Industries using respirators==\nA wide range of industries use respirators including healthcare & pharmaceuticals, defense & public safety services (defense, firefighting & law enforcement), oil and gas industries, manufacturing (automotive, chemical, metal fabrication, food and beverage, wood working, paper and pulp), mining, construction, agriculture and forestry, cement production, power generation, shipbuilding and the textile industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/osh/os/osnr0014.txt|title=Respirator use and practices|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Correct usage ==\n[[File:Protection Factors of filtering facepiece, measured in real time during work.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Workplace protection factor (PF)]] of filtering facepiece, measured in real time with two optical dust meters.

Quantitative fit testing typically uses a specially prepared respirator with an inserted probe. The respirator is donned, and aerosol concentrations inside and outside of the mask are compared and used to determine a numerical fit factor. Typical room atmosphere contains sufficient particulates to perform the test, but aerosol generators can be used to improve the test accuracy.\n\n=== Contrast with surgical mask ===\n[[File:Understanding_the_difference_between_surgical_masks_and_N95_respirators.pdf|alt=A table listing the attributes of surgical masks and N95 respirators in eight categories|thumb|An infographic on the difference between [[Surgical mask|surgical masks]] and [[NIOSH air filtration rating|N95]] respirators]]\n\nA [[surgical mask]] is a loose-fitting, disposable device that creates a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environment. If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle [[respiratory droplets|droplets]], splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain viruses and bacteria. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of the wearer's saliva and respiratory secretions to others.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks|title=N95 Respirators and Surgical Masks (Face Masks)|last=|first=|date=2020-03-11|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|language=en|accessdate=2020-03-28}} {{PD-inline}}</ref>\n\nA surgical mask, by design, does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures.

Subsequent respirators were reusable but bulky and uncomfortable. In the 1970s, the Bureau of Mines and NIOSH developed standards for single-use respirators, and the first N95 respirator was developed by 3M and approved in 1972.[24]\n\n===World War I===\nThe first recorded response and defense against chemical attacks using respirators occurred during the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] on the Western Front in [[World War I]]. It was the first time Germany used [[chemical weapon]]s on a large scale releasing 168 tons of [[chlorine gas]] over a four-mile (6&nbsp;km) front killing around 6,000 troops within ten minutes through [[asphyxiation]]. The gas being denser than air flowed downwards forcing troops to climb out of their [[trenches]]. Reserve Canadian troops, who were away from the attack, used [[urine]]-soaked cloths as primitive respirators. A Canadian soldier realized that the [[ammonia]] in urine would react with the chlorine, neutralizing it, and that the water would dissolve the chlorine, allowing soldiers to breathe through the gas.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\nChina normally makes 10 million masks<!-- or [[dust mask]] or [[surgical mask]]--> per day, about half of the world production.

This kind of respirator is reusable, with the filters being replaced periodically.]]\n\nA '''respirator''' is a device designed to protect the wearer from inhaling hazardous atmospheres, including [[wikt:fumes|fumes]], [[vapor|vapours]], [[gases]] and [[particulate matter]] such as dusts and airborne [[microorganisms]]. There are two main categories: the ''air-purifying respirator'', in which respirable air is obtained by filtering a contaminated atmosphere, and the ''air-supplied respirator'', in which an alternate supply of breathable air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contaminants.\n\nAir-purifying respirators range from relatively inexpensive single-use, disposable face masks sometimes referred to as a [[dust mask]] to more robust reusable models with replaceable cartridges often called a [[gas mask]].\n\n==Physical form==\nAll respirators have some type of facepiece held to the wearer's head with straps, a cloth harness, or some other method.  Facepieces come in many different styles and sizes, to accommodate all types of face shapes. The differences in respirator design impact the [[respirator assigned protection factors]], i.e. the resulting degree of protection from which kind of hazard.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThere are three categories of particulate respirators: particulate-filtering facepiece respirators are discarded when they become unsuitable for further use due to considerations of hygiene, excessive resistance, or physical damage; elastomeric respirators are reusable because the facepiece is cleaned and reused, but the filter cartridges are discarded and replaced when they become unsuitable for further use; and [[Powered air-purifying respirator|powered air-purifying respirators]] have a battery-powered blower that moves the airflow through the filters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource1quest1.html|title=Respirator Trusted-Source Information: What are they?|last=|first=|date=2018-01-29|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nRespirators can have half-face forms that cover the bottom half of the face including the nose and mouth, and full-face forms that cover the entire face. Half-face respirators should only be worn in environments where the contaminants are not toxic to the eyes or facial area. For example, someone who is spray painting could wear a half-face respirator, but someone who works with [[chlorine]] gas would have to wear a full-face respirator.\n\n== Types of filtration ==\n\n=== Air-purifying ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Personal protective equipment]] -->\n[[File:Police officer wearing half-mask respirator.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Protective P100 filter mask worn by NYPD officer]]\nAir-purifying respirators are used against particulates, gases, and vapors that are at atmospheric concentrations less than immediately dangerous to life and health. This includes:\n\n*[[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative-pressure]] respirators using mechanical filters and chemical media\n*[[positive pressure|positive-pressure]] units such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)\n*Escape Only respirators or hoods such as Air-Purifying Escape Respirators for use by the general public for [[chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear]]  (CBRN) terrorism incidents.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFull hood, half- or full-facepiece designs are marketed in many varieties depending on the hazard of concern using an [[air filter]] which acts passively on air inhaled by the wearer. Two common examples of this type of respirator are single-use escape hoods and filter masks. The latter are typically simple, light, single-piece, half-face masks and employ the first three mechanical filter mechanisms in the list below to remove particulates from the air stream.  The most common of these is the disposable white N95 variety. It is discarded after single use or some extended period depending on the contaminant. Filter masks also come in replaceable-cartridge, multiple-use models. Typically one or two cartridges attach securely to a mask which has built into it a corresponding number of valves for inhalation and one for exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) and the [[International Safety Equipment Association]] (ISEA) established the American National Standard for Air-Purifying Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices to define both test criteria and approval methods for fire/smoke escape hoods. ANSI/ISEA Standard 110 provides design guidance to manufacturers of Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices (RPED) in the form of performance requirements and testing procedures. The standard covers certification, ISO registration for the manufacturer, associated test methods, labeling, conditioning requirements, independent process and quality control audits, and follow-up inspection programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://safetyequipment.org/c/std110-2009.cfm |title=International Safety Equipment Association |publisher=Safetyequipment.org |accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> ANSI/ISEA 110 was prepared by members of the ISEA RPED group, in consultation with testing laboratories and was reviewed by a consensus panel representing users, health and safety professionals and government representatives.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission uses ANSI/ISEA 110 as the benchmark in their testing of fire escape masks.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n====Mechanical filter====\n{{Main|Mechanical filter respirator}}\n[[File:Atemluftfilter Einwegmaske.jpg|thumb|Filtering half mask with exhalation valve (class: FFP3)]]\n\n[[File:What it Means to be NIOSH-Approved - A look into N95 Certification Testing.webm|thumb|right|300px|A video describing N95 certification testing]]Mechanical filter respirators retain particulate matter such as dust created during [[woodwork]]ing or metal processing, when contaminated air is passed through the filter material. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nMechanical filters remove contaminants from air in several ways: ''interception'' when particles following a line of flow in the airstream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it; ''impaction'', when larger particles unable to follow the curving contours of the airstream are forced to embed in one of the fibers directly; this increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity; by ''diffusion'', where gas molecules collide with the smallest particles, especially those below 100&nbsp;nm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter, increasing the probability that particles will be stopped by either of the previous two mechanisms; and by using certain resins, waxes, and plastics as coatings on the filter material to attract particles with an [[electrostatic charge]] that holds them on the filter surface.\n\nThere are many different filtration standards that vary by jurisdiction.  In the [[United States]], the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] defines the categories of particulate filters according to their [[NIOSH air filtration rating]].  The most common of these are the [[N95 mask]], which filters at least 95% of [[airborne particles]] but is not resistant to [[oil]].  Other categories filter 99% or 99.97% of particles, or have varying degrees of resistance to oil.<ref name=\"fact sheet\">{{cite journal| last1 = Metzler | first1 = R| last2 = Szalajda | first2 = J | title = NIOSH Fact Sheet: NIOSH Approval Labels - Key Information to Protect Yourself | journal = DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2011-179 | year = 2011 | url =https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-179/pdfs/2011-179.pdf | issn =0343-6993}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[European Union]], [[European standard]] EN 143 defines the 'P' classes of particle filters that can be attached to a face mask, while European standard EN 149 defines classes of \"filtering half masks\" or \"filtering face pieces\" ([[FFP mask|FFP masks]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAccording to [[3M]], respirators made according to the following standards from other countries are equivalent to U.S. N95 or European FFP2 respirators include the Chinese KN95, Australian / New Zealand P2, Korean 1st Class also referred to as KF94, and Japanese DS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1791500O/comparison-ffp2-kn95-n95-filtering-facepiece-respirator-classes-tb.pdf|title=Technical Bulletin: Comparison of FFP2, KN95, and N95 and Other Filtering Facepiece Respirator Classes|last=|first=|date=January 2020|website=|publisher=3M Personal Safety Division|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n====Chemical cartridge====\n[[File:Respirator canister with ESLI for asid gases -1.JPG|thumb|Combined gas and particulate respirator filter for protection against acid gases, the type of BKF (\u0411\u041a\u0424).

A typical [[organic compound|organic]] vapor respirator cartridge is a metal or plastic case containing from 25 to 40&nbsp;grams of sorption media such as [[activated charcoal]] or certain [[resin]]s.  The service life of the cartridge varies based, among other variables, on the carbon weight and molecular weight of the vapor and the cartridge media, the concentration of vapor in the atmosphere, the relative humidity of the atmosphere, and the breathing rate of the respirator wearer.  When filter cartridges become [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]]{{dn|date=February 2020}} or particulate accumulation within them begins to restrict air flow, they must be changed.<ref name=\"CartridgesReplacement\">[[:File:Methods for the timely replacement of cartridges in respirators.pdf|The document describes the methods used previously and currently used to perform the timely replacement of cartridges in air purifying respirators.]]</ref>\n\nIf the concentration of harmful gases is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life or health]], in workplaces covered by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] the US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] specifies the use of air-supplied respirators except when intended solely for escape during emergencies.<ref name=\"Standard\">OSHA standard [http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=12716 29 CFR 1910.134] \"Respiratory Protection\"</ref> [[NIOSH]] also discourages their use under such conditions.<ref name=\"\u0423\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a-\u043f\u043e-\u0432\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0443-2004\">{{cite book|last=Bollinger|first=Nancy|title=NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2005-100/|series=DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2005-100|year=2004|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|pages=32|display-authors=etal|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2005100}}</ref>\n\n====Powered air-purifying respirators====\n{{Main|Powered air-purifying respirator}}\n\nPowered air-purifying respirator (PAPRs) take [[contaminate]]d air, remove a certain quantity of pollutants and return the air to the user. There are different units for different environments. The units consist of a powered [[fan (mechanical)|fan]] which forces incoming air through one or more [[filter (air)|filter]]s to the user for breathing. The fan and filters may be carried by the user or they may be remotely mounted and the user breathes the air through tubing.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe filter type must be matched to the contaminants that need to be removed. Some PAPR's are designed to remove fine particulate matter, while others are suitable for working with [[volatile organic compound]]s as those in [[spray paint]]s. These must have their filter elements replaced more often than a particulate filter.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)===\n{{Main|Self-contained breathing apparatus}}\n\nA self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) typically has three main components: a high-pressure air cylinder (e.g., 2200 psi to 4500 psi), a pressure gauge and regulator, and an inhalation connection (mouthpiece, mouth mask or full face mask), connected together and mounted to a carrying frame or a harness with adjustable shoulder straps and belt so it can be worn on the back. There are two kinds of SCBA: open circuit and closed circuit. Most modern SCBAs are open-circuit. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOpen-circuit industrial breathing sets are filled with filtered, compressed air. The compressed air passes through a regulator, is inhaled and exhaled out of the circuit, quickly depleting the supply of air. Air cylinders are made of aluminum, steel, or of a composite construction like fiberglass-wrapped aluminum. The \"positive pressure\" type is common, which supplies a steady stream of air to stop fumes or smoke from leaking into the mask. Other SCBA's are of the \"demand\" type, which only supply air when the regulator senses the user inhaling. All fire departments and those working in toxic environments use the positive pressure SCBA for safety reasons.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe closed-circuit type SCBA filters, supplements, and recirculates exhaled gas like a [[rebreather]]. It is used when a longer-duration supply of breathing gas is needed, such as in mine rescue and in long tunnels, and going through passages too narrow for a large open-circuit air cylinder.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== Industries using respirators==\nA wide range of industries use respirators including healthcare & pharmaceuticals, defense & public safety services (defense, firefighting & law enforcement), oil and gas industries, manufacturing (automotive, chemical, metal fabrication, food and beverage, wood working, paper and pulp), mining, construction, agriculture and forestry, cement production, power generation, shipbuilding and the textile industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/osh/os/osnr0014.txt|title=Respirator use and practices|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Correct usage ==\n[[File:Protection Factors of filtering facepiece, measured in real time during work.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Workplace protection factor (PF)]] of filtering facepiece, measured in real time with two optical dust meters.

Subsequent respirators were reusable but bulky and uncomfortable. In the 1970s, the Bureau of Mines and NIOSH developed standards for single-use respirators, and the first N95 respirator was developed by 3M and approved in 1972.[24]\n\n===World War I===\nThe first recorded response and defense against chemical attacks using respirators occurred during the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] on the Western Front in [[World War I]]. It was the first time Germany used [[chemical weapon]]s on a large scale releasing 168 tons of [[chlorine gas]] over a four-mile (6&nbsp;km) front killing around 6,000 troops within ten minutes through [[asphyxiation]]. The gas being denser than air flowed downwards forcing troops to climb out of their [[trenches]]. Reserve Canadian troops, who were away from the attack, used [[urine]]-soaked cloths as primitive respirators.
