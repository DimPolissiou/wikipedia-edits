Their cross-city rivals [[Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C.|Bradford (Park Avenue)]] joined the league five years later, for the same season as City's first in [[Football League First Division|Division One]].\n\nThe first game between the two teams at any level had been in the North-Eastern League. Other meetings had taken place in the West Riding Cup before the first competitive game was in the [[FA Cup]] on 24 February 1912 at Park Avenue, a year after Bradford City's [[FA Cup Final 1911|FA Cup triumph]]. A goal from Frank O'Rourke for City gave them the first derby success.\n\nThe first all-Bradford league match took place at [[Valley Parade]] on 23 October 1914 in Division One in front of a crowd of 29,802, when City won 3\u20132. Park Avenue won the reverse fixture 3\u20130. The clubs met in the top flight just four more times before Park Avenue were relegated in [[1920-21 in English football|1920\u201321]]. City were themselves relegated to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] but a second successive relegation for Park Avenue meant the clubs did not meet again until 1927 in [[Football League Third Division North|Division Three (North)]]. That season's derby saw Park Avenue record a record 5\u20130 for a Bradford derby on their way to the title and promotion. City kept the title in Bradford the following season.\n\nBetween the [[1929-30 in English football|1929\u201330]] and [[1936-37 in English football|1936\u201337]] seasons the clubs continued their rivalries until City were relegated, one place below Park Avenue. The derby was resumed from [[1950-51 in English football|1950\u201351]] to [[1957-58 in English football|1957\u201358]] in Division Three (North), a period which included an FA Cup tie in December 1951 and a record 5\u20130 win for City at home on 16 April 1956. A league restructure meant the clubs did not meet again in the league again until the [[1963-64 in English football|1963\u201364]] season in [[Football League Fourth Division|Division Four]], although the teams did meet again in the FA Cup in December 1958 and the [[League Cup]] in September 1963, when Park Avenue were 7\u20133 winners.\n\nThe teams met on six successive seasons until [[1968-69 in English football|1968\u201369]] when City were promoted to Division Three in fourth spot and Park Avenue had to seek re-election when they came bottom of the league. The [[1969-70 in English football|following]] season Park Avenue failed a fourth successive re-election and were replaced by [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]], before they went into [[liquidation]] in 1974 and the teams have never met in competitive football since.\n\nIn modern times, the teams traditionally participate in a pre season friendly, usually the week before the start of the new season.\n\n==Results==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Competition\n!Played\n!City\n!Draw\n!Avenue\n!City goals\n!Avenue

The [[1969-70 in English football|following]] season Park Avenue failed a fourth successive re-election and were replaced by [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]], before they went into [[liquidation]] in 1974 and the teams have never met in competitive football since.\n\nIn modern times, the teams traditionally participate in a pre season friendly, usually the week before the start of the new season.\n\n==Results==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Competition\n!Played\n!City\n!Draw\n!Avenue\n!City goals\n!Avenue goals\n|-\n|'''League'''\n|52\n|20\n|11\n|21\n|72\n|78\n|-\n|'''FA Cup'''\n|3\n|2\n|0\n|1\n|5\n|3\n|-\n|'''League Cup'''\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|3\n|7\n|-\n|-class=\"sortbottom\"\n!Totals\n!56\n!22\n!11\n!23\n!80\n!88\n|}\n\n==Crossing the divide==\n{{see also|Category:Bradford City A.F.C. players|Category:Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C. players}}\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\nThe following is a list of players who have represented both clubs in at least one senior fixture.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n!rowspan=2|Name\n!rowspan=2|Position\n!colspan=3|Bradford City\n!colspan=3|Bradford (Park Avenue)\n|-\n!Career!!Apps!!Goals\n!Career!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|[[Simon Ainge]]\n|DF\n|2006\u20132009||14||0\n|2009\u20132010|| ||\n|-\n|[[Wayne Benn]]\n|MF\n|1994\u20131996||10||0\n|1996\u20132004|| ||\n|-\n|[[Joe Brown (footballer born 1988)|Joe Brown]]\n|FW\n|2005\u20132007||19||1\n| || ||\n|-\n|[[Chris Brandon]]\n|MF\n|2008\u20132010||27||2\n|1995\u20131997<br>1999|| ||\n|-\n|[[David Brown (footballer born 1989)|David Brown]]\n|FW\n|2008||5||1\n|2010\u2013|| ||\n|-\n|[[Wayne Bullimore]]\n|MF\n|1995\u20131997||2||0\n| ||4||0\n|-\n|[[Norman Corner]]\n|FW\n|1969\u20131972||110||16\n|1972\u20131973|| ||\n|-\n|[[Joe Colbeck]]\n|MF\n|2004\u20132009||109||8\n| || ||\n|-\n|[[Terry Dolan (footballer)|Terry Dolan]]\n|MF\n|1976\u20131981||195||43\n|1969\u20131970||48||0\n|-\n|[[Mitchell Downie]]\n|GK\n|1959\u20131963||134||0\n|1950\u20131954||154||0\n|-\n|[[Donald Duckett]]\n|\n|1914\u20131924||155||6\n|1927\u20131929|| ||\n|-\n|[[Karl Goddard]]\n|DF\n|1986\u20131990||73||0\n| || ||\n|-\n|[[Neil Grayston (footballer)|Neil Grayston]]\n|DF\n|1995\u20131996||7||0\n|1996\u20131999<br>2004|| ||\n|-\n|[[Rodney Green (footballer)|Rodney Green]]\n|FW\n|1962\u20131964||66||39\n|1962||19||6\n|-\n|[[Bobby Ham]]\n|FW\n|1968\u20131970<br>1973\u20131975||115<br>73||40<br>24\n|1961\u20131963<br> || ||\n|-\n|[[Geoff Hudson]]\n|\n| || ||\n| || ||\n|-\n|[[Andy Lee (footballer, born 1982)|Andy Lee]]\n|MF\n|2002\u20132003||2||0\n| || ||\n|-\n|[[Gerry Lightowler]]\n|DF\n|1968\u20131969||11||0\n|1958\u20131968||208||1\n|-\n|[[Harry Peel (footballer)|Harry Peel]]\n|FW\n|1929\u20131936||186||26\n|1920\u20131926||207||37\n|-\n|[[Charlie Rackstraw]]\n|FW\n|1967\u20131969||104||27\n|1970\u20131971|| ||\n|-\n|[[Neil Redfearn]]\n|MF\n|1999\u20132000||17||1\n|2006\u20132007||27||5\n|-\n|[[Kevin Sanasy]]\n|FW\n|2002\u20132005||9||1\n| || ||\n|-\n|[[Carl Shutt]]\n|FW\n|1994\u20131995||89||16\n|2004\u20132005||13||1\n|-\n|[[Whelan Ward]]\n|FW\n|1948\u20131954||149||37\n|1955\u20131959||108||31\n|}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n| last = Frost\n| first = Terry\n| title = Bradford City A Complete Record 1903\u20131988\n| publisher = Breedon Books Sport\n| year = 1988\n| pages = 159\u2013167\n| isbn = 0-907969-38-0}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Bradford City A.F.C.}}\n{{Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.}}\n{{United Kingdom Football Derbies}}\n{{Men's Football in West Yorkshire}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2011}}\n\n[[Category:England football derbies]]\n[[Category:Bradford City A.F.C.]]\n[[Category:Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C.]]\n[[Category:Sport in Bradford]]\n[[Category:Football in West Yorkshire]]\n", "name_user": "GiantSnowman", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_derby"}

Previous warnings had also been given about a major build-up of litter in the cavity below the seats in the stand. The stand had been officially condemned and was due to be replaced with a steel structure after the football season ended.\n\nThe match against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], the final game of that season, had started in a celebratory atmosphere with the home-team receiving the [[Football League Third Division]] trophy. At 3.40&nbsp;p.m., a small fire in the main stand was remarked upon by the TV commentator [[John Helm (commentator)|John Helm]], but in less than four minutes, with the windy conditions, it had entirely engulfed the whole stand, trapping some people in their seats. In the mass panic that ensued, fleeing crowds escaped on to the pitch but others at the back of the stand tried to break down locked exit doors to escape, and many were burnt to death at the turnstiles gates, which had also been locked after the match had begun. There were many cases of heroism, with more than 50 people later receiving police awards or commendations for bravery.\n\nThe disaster led to rigid new safety standards in UK stadiums, including the banning of new wooden grandstands. It was also a catalyst for the substantial redevelopment and modernisation of many British football grounds within the following thirty years. Bradford City continues to support the burns unit at the [[University of Bradford]] as its official charity.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of Bradford City A.F.C.}}\n[[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City Association Football Club]] had played their home games at [[Valley Parade]], in [[Bradford]], since the club was formed in 1903. It had been the former home of [[Manningham F.C.|Manningham Rugby Football Club]], which had moved into the ground in 1886. The playing area and stands were very basic but the ground had enough room for 18,000&nbsp;spectators.<ref>{{harvnb|Frost|1988|p=53}}</ref> When the [[association football]] club was formed, the ground was changed very little and had no covered accommodation. However, when Bradford City won promotion to the [[English football league system|highest level of English football]], [[Football League First Division|Division One]], in 1908, club officials sanctioned an upgrade programme. Football architect [[Archibald Leitch]] was commissioned to carry out the work.<ref name=\"f54\">{{harvnb|Frost|1988|p=54}}</ref> By 1911, his work was completed.<ref>{{harvnb|Frost|1988|p=55}}</ref> It included a main stand which seated 5,300&nbsp;fans, and had room for a further 7,000 standing spectators in the paddock in front.<ref name=\"f54\"/> The main stand was described as a \"mammoth structure\", but was unusual for its time because of its place on the side of a hill. The entrances to the stand were all at the rear and were higher than the rest of the ground.<ref name=\"i117\">{{harvnb|Inglis|1987|p=117}}</ref>\n\nAlthough there had been some changes to other parts of the ground, the main stand remained unaltered by 1985.<ref name=\"i117\"/> Football ground writer [[Simon Inglis]] had described the view from the stand as \"like watching football from the [[cockpit]] of a [[Sopwith Camel]]\" because of its antiquated supports and struts.<ref>{{harvnb|Inglis|1987|p=118}}</ref> However, he also warned the club of a build-up of litter beneath the stand because of a gap between the seats. Some repair work was carried out, but in July 1984, the club was warned again, this time by a county council engineer, because of the club's plans to claim for ground improvements from the Football Trust. One letter from the council said the problems \"should be rectified as soon as possible\"; a second said: \"A carelessly discarded cigarette could give rise to a fire risk.\" In March 1985, the club's plans became more apparent when it took delivery of steel for a new roof.<ref>{{harvnb|Inglis|1987|p=119}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PeterJackson.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Peter Jackson (footballer born 1961)|Peter Jackson]] was presented with the league trophy before the final game.]]\nThe [[1984\u201385 in English football|1984\u201385]] season had been one of Bradford City's most successful seasons. Following a 1\u20130 defeat to [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] at the end of September, the side went 13&nbsp;games undefeated, during which they went top of the [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] table by defeating [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] 3\u20131. City maintained their superiority and opened up an 11-point gap over the rest of the league by February, and were assured of the championship title courtesy of a 2\u20130 victory against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the penultimate game of the season, guaranteeing [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] football for the first time since 1937. As a result, Bradford-born [[captain (association football)|captain]] [[Peter Jackson (footballer born 1961)|Peter Jackson]] was presented with the league trophy before the final game of the season with mid-table [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] at Valley Parade on 11 May 1985.<ref>{{harvnb|Frost|1988|pp=36\u201337}}</ref><!--this seems too detailed and long for an article about a fire-->\n\nAs it was the first piece of league [[Silverware (sport)|silverware]] that the club had captured since they won the [[Football League Third Division North|Division Three (North)]] title 56&nbsp;years earlier, 11,076&nbsp;supporters were in the ground.

He lit a cigarette and when it was coming to an end he put it down on to the floorboard and tried to put his foot on it to put it out. It slipped through a hole in the floorboard. A minute later he saw a small plume of smoke so he poured his coffee on it and so did his son. It seemed to put it out. But a minute or so later there was suddenly a bigger whoosh of smoke so they went to get a steward. By the time they got back, the whole thing had taken off.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/572145/Bradford-City-Valley-Parade-Fire-Minute-Silence|title=EXCLUSIVE: Bradford's Valley Parade fire must be remembered like Hillsborough|first=Neil|last=Squires|date=23 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nOne witness saw paper or debris on fire, about {{convert|9|in|spell=in}} below the floor boards.<ref name=\"i361\"/> The stand seats did not have [[Stair riser|risers]]; this had allowed a large accumulation of rubbish and paper waste in the cavity space under the stand, which had not been cleared for many months.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nSpectators later spoke of initially feeling their feet becoming warmer; one of them ran to the back of the stand for a [[fire extinguisher]] but found none. A police officer shouted to a colleague for an [[extinguisher]]. His call was misheard, and instead the [[fire brigade]] were radioed.<ref name=\"i361\"/> The call was timed at 3:43&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"hideous images\"/> The fire escalated very rapidly, and flames became visible; police started to evacuate the stand. The blaze began to spread, and the roof and wooden stands were soon on fire. One eyewitness, Geoffrey Mitchell, told the [[BBC]]: \"It spread like a flash. I've never seen anything like it. The smoke was choking. You could hardly breathe.\"<ref name=\"on this day\"/> As spectators began to cascade over the wall separating the stand from the pitch, the linesman on that side of the pitch informed match [[referee (association football)|referee]] Norman Glover, who stopped the game with three minutes remaining before half-time. The original match referee (as named in the match programme) was Don Shaw, but he could not officiate due to an injury; Glover had been appointed to the match as replacement official. Shaw is still sometimes wrongly named as the match referee.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe stand's wooden roof, covered with layers of highly flammable [[Bituminous waterproofing|bituminous roofing felt]], offered no resistance to the flames. Burning timbers and molten materials fell from the roof onto the crowd and seating below, and dense black [[smoke]] enveloped a passageway behind the stand, where many spectators were trying to escape.<ref name=\"i361\"/> It took less than four minutes for the entire stand to be engulfed in flames.<ref name=\"hideous images\"/>\n\nThere were no extinguishers in the stand's passageway for fear of vandalism, and one spectator ran to the clubhouse to find one, but was overcome by smoke and impeded by others trying to escape. Supporters either ran upwards to the back of the stand or downwards to the pitch to escape. The stand had no perimeter fencing to keep fans from accessing the pitch, thus averting an instance of [[crush asphyxia]], as in the 1989 [[Hillsborough disaster]]. Footage of the accident at this point shows levels of confusion among the spectators \u2013 while many were trying to escape or to cross the pitch to the relative safety of the neighbouring stands, other spectators were observed cheering or waving to the still-rolling pitchside cameras. The lack of perimeter fencing kept the death toll down, and prevented it from reaching the hundreds or potentially the thousands. The Bradford City stadium fire was still the worst sporting tragedy of its kind in England at the time. Elsewhere in Britain, only the 66 deaths at [[1971 Ibrox disaster|Ibrox Stadium]] in Scotland 14 years earlier had seen a higher death toll.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nMost of the exits at the back were locked or shut, and there were no stewards present to open them, but seven were forced open or found open.<ref name=\"i120\"/><ref name=\"i361\"/> Three men smashed down one door and at least one exit was opened by people outside, which again helped prevent further deaths.<ref name=\"i361\"/><ref name=\"on this day\"/> Geoffrey Mitchell said: \"There was panic as fans stampeded to an exit which was padlocked. Two or three burly men put their weight against it and smashed the gate open. Otherwise, I would not have been able to get out.\"<ref name=\"on this day\"/> At the front of the stand, men threw children over the wall to help them escape. Most of those who escaped onto the pitch were saved.<ref name=\"i361\"/>\n\nPeople who had escaped the fire then tried to assist their fellow supporters.

However, the fire had consumed the stand entirely by that point and they were faced with huge flames and very dense smoke. As many supporters still required rescue from the stand, they were unable to immediately start fighting the source of the fire.<!--<ref name=\"hideous images\"/>-->\n\nThe fire destroyed the main stand completely and left only burned seats, lamps and metal fences remaining. Some of those who died were still sitting upright in their seats, covered by remnants of tarpaulin that had fallen from the roof. Police worked until 4&nbsp;am the next morning, under lighting, to remove all the bodies.

One, now re-situated to that end of the stand where the fire began, is a sculpture donated on the initial re-opening of Valley Parade in December 1986 by Sylvia Graucob, a then [[Jersey]]-based former [[West Yorkshire]] woman. The other, situated by the main entrance, was donated by the club after its \u00a37.5 million (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|7.5|2002|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) rebuilding of the original main stand in 2002. It has a black [[marble]] fascia on which the names and ages of those that died are inscribed in gold, and a black marble platform on which people can leave flowers and mementos. There is a twin memorial sculpture, unveiled on 11 May 1986, which has the names of the dead inscribed on it. They were donated by Bradford's [[Town twinning|twin city]] of [[Hamm]], Germany, and are situated in front of [[Bradford City Hall]] in both locations.\n\nAfter the fire, Bradford City also announced they would thereafter play with a black trim on their shirt sleeves as a permanent memorial to those who had died.\n\n===Commendations===\n\nFour police officers, [[Police Constable]]s David Britton and John Richard Ingham and [[Chief Inspector]]s Charles Frederick Mawson and Terence Michael Slocombe, and two spectators, Richard Gough and David Hustler, were awarded the [[Queen's Gallantry Medal]] for their actions.<ref name=\"London Gazette\">{{London Gazette|issue=50531 |supp=y|pages=7213\u20137214|date=28 May 1986}}</ref> PCs Peter Donald Barrett and David Charles Midgley, along with spectators Michael William Bland and Timothy Peter Leigh received the [[Queen's Commendation for Brave Conduct]].<ref name=\"London Gazette\"/> In total, 28 police officers and 22 supporters, who were publicly documented as having saved at least one life, later received police commendations or bravery awards.

Valley Parade re-opened on 14 December 1986, when Bradford City beat an England XI 2\u20131 in a friendly. Since then, it has been further re-developed and, today, Valley Parade is a modern 25,136 [[all-seater stadium]], which is virtually unrecognisable from how it was at the time of the disaster, save for the original [[wikt:clubhouse|clubhouse]] that still stands beside the main stand, and the flank support wall that runs down the Hollywell Ash Lane at the \"Bradford End\".\n\n===Effect on Lincoln City===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[File:Valley Parade 1990s.jpg|thumb|right|[[Valley Parade]] after Bradford City's return in late 1986, but before further developments during the 1990s]]\n\n[[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] suffered two successive relegations, first to the Fourth Division in 1986, and again in 1987, becoming the first team to be automatically relegated from the Football League itself. They were immediately promoted back to the Football League in 1988, and survived for 23 years before being relegated again in 2011. Although some attributed Lincoln City's sudden demise to the psychological effects of the fire on its players (together with the resignation of successful manager [[Colin Murphy (footballer born 1950)|Colin Murphy]] shortly before the fire), it symbolised the wider crisis that the introduction of new safety legislation brought to Lincoln's [[Sincil Bank]] home.\n\nThe timber construction of St. Andrew's Stand, Main Stand and the roof of its popular Railway End terrace were immediately condemned as fire hazards, which saw [[seating capacity]] briefly cut to nil. Lincoln City's board responded by committing \u00a31,100,000 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|1.1|1985|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) to their ground's renovation in the year that immediately followed the fire at Valley Parade, and over the following decade made improvements that eventually totalled \u00a33,000,000. After its renovation in 1990 they named the home end of their ground the 'Stacey-West Stand', in honour of Bill Stacey and Jim West, the two Lincoln City supporters who were amongst the 56 to die at Bradford. Each year Lincoln send representatives to the annual memorial service in Bradford city centre and between 2007 and 2009, were managed by Bradford's captain that day, Peter Jackson.\n\nThe two sides met for the first time after the fire in April 1989, when they arranged a benefit match in aid of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], at Valley Parade.<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://www.redimps.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10440~1498199,00.html \n |title=We've Met (Bradford) Before \n |date=23 December 2008 \n |accessdate=23 December 2008 \n |publisher=Lincoln City F.C. \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226000421/http://www.redimps.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10440~1498199%2C00.html \n |archivedate=26 February 2009 \n}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment of casualties and Burns Research Unit==\n\nThe [[Bradford Burns Unit]] was set up by Professor David Sharpe after he received many of the victims following the fire.

Among the main outcomes of the inquiry were the banning of new [[wooden]] [[grandstand]]s at all UK sports grounds, the immediate closure of other wooden stands deemed unsafe and the banning of smoking in other wooden stands.\n\nAt the time of the disaster, many stadiums had perimeter fencing between the stands and the pitch to prevent [[Football hooliganism|incidents of football hooliganism]] \u2013 particularly [[pitch invasion]]s \u2013 which were rife during the 1980s. The main stand at Bradford was not surrounded by fencing, and therefore most of the spectators in it could escape onto the pitch \u2013 if they had been penned in then the death toll would inevitably have been in the hundreds if not the thousands. However, the turnstiles were locked and none of the stadium staff were present to unlock them, leaving no escape through the normal entrances and exits. Most of the fans who took this escape route were killed or seriously injured. Fans in the next stand (the \"Bradford End\") pulled down the fence separating them from the pitch.\n\nThe Popplewell Inquiry found that the club had been warned about the fire risk that the rubbish accumulating under the stand had posed. The stand had already been condemned, and the demolition teams were due to start work two days later. However, as there was no real precedent, most Bradfordians accepted that the fire was a terrible piece of misfortune. A discarded cigarette and a dilapidated wooden stand, which had survived because the club did not have the money to replace it, were considered to have conspired to cause the worst disaster in the history of the [[Football League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bradfordcityfire.co.uk/popplewell-inquiry/ |title=Popplewell Inquiry \u2013 Bradford City Fire |accessdate=31 March 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408222346/http://bradfordcityfire.co.uk/popplewell-inquiry/ |archivedate= 8 April 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Inquest and legal test case===\n\nIn July 1985 an inquest was held into the deaths; at the hearings the [[coroner]] James Turnbull recommended a death by misadventure outcome, which the jury agreed upon.

Nigel Adams \u2013 who worked for 12 years as a fire investigator with a British fire service \u2013 was spurred on by the book to join the call for a fresh inquiry, stating that Fletcher's book was \"one of the best accounts of a fire, as seen from a victim's point of view, and as a piece of investigative writing, I have ever read\". He agreed that the inquiry into Bradford, led by the judge [[Oliver Popplewell]], was inadequate and that there are many unanswered questions. He went on to state:\n\n\"In 1985 fire investigation in Britain was in its infancy and some would say at that time most fire investigators were not much more than dust-kickers. Like all areas of forensic investigations, it has come on leaps and bounds. However, there is a lot in this book that troubles me about the science, or lack of it, used in the testing of the investigators' hypothesis as to the source of the ignition. The book also raises concerns about the speed of the inquiry and the fact that it commenced a few weeks after the fire and lasted for only a few days, whereas other inquiries into similar incidents, pre and post the Bradford fire, have taken years to come to fruition and months to be heard. The fact the inquiry also embraced the investigation into another incident which happened on the same day, a riot in which a young boy died at Birmingham City, makes it seem more frivolous.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/22/bradford-city-fire-expert-new-investigation |title=Bradford fire: expert demands new investigation into blaze |first=Daniel |last=Taylor |date=22 April 2015 |accessdate=31 March 2017 |work=The Guardian |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401061319/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/22/bradford-city-fire-expert-new-investigation |archivedate= 1 April 2017 }}</ref>\n\nAdams also went on to state that \"I have read in some newspapers that he is being berated for his campaign to have a new inquiry. I don't see that. There is no malicious vendetta, there is no over-exaggeration, there are no trumped-up facts. It is a simple account laid out for all to see.

Previous warnings had also been given about a major build-up of litter in the cavity below the seats in the stand. The stand had been officially condemned and was due to be replaced with a steel structure after the football season ended.\n\nThe match against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], the final game of that season, had started in a celebratory atmosphere with the home-team receiving the [[Football League Third Division]] trophy. At 3.40&nbsp;p.m., a small fire in the main stand was remarked upon by the TV commentator [[John Helm (commentator)|John Helm]], but in less than four minutes, with the windy conditions, it had entirely engulfed the whole stand, trapping some people in their seats. In the mass panic that ensued, fleeing crowds escaped on to the pitch but others at the back of the stand tried to break down locked exit doors to escape, and many were burnt to death at the turnstiles gates, which had also been locked after the match had begun. There were many cases of heroism, with more than 50 people later receiving police awards or commendations for bravery.\n\nThe disaster led to rigid new safety standards in UK stadiums, including the banning of new wooden grandstands. It was also a catalyst for the substantial redevelopment and modernisation of many British football grounds within the following thirty years. Bradford City continues to support the burns unit at the [[University of Bradford]] as its official charity.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of Bradford City A.F.C.}}\n[[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City Association Football Club]] had played their home games at [[Valley Parade]], in [[Bradford]], since the club was formed in 1903. It had been the former home of [[Manningham F.C.|Manningham Rugby Football Club]], which had moved into the ground in 1886. The playing area and stands were very basic but the ground had enough room for 18,000&nbsp;spectators.<ref>{{harvnb|Frost|1988|p=53}}</ref> When the [[association football]] club was formed, the ground was changed very little and had no covered accommodation. However, when Bradford City won promotion to the [[English football league system|highest level of English football]], [[Football League First Division|Division One]], in 1908, club officials sanctioned an upgrade programme. Football architect [[Archibald Leitch]] was commissioned to carry out the work.<ref name=\"f54\">{{harvnb|Frost|1988|p=54}}</ref> By 1911, his work was completed.<ref>{{harvnb|Frost|1988|p=55}}</ref> It included a main stand which seated 5,300&nbsp;fans, and had room for a further 7,000 standing spectators in the paddock in front.<ref name=\"f54\"/> The main stand was described as a \"mammoth structure\", but was unusual for its time because of its place on the side of a hill. The entrances to the stand were all at the rear and were higher than the rest of the ground.<ref name=\"i117\">{{harvnb|Inglis|1987|p=117}}</ref>\n\nAlthough there had been some changes to other parts of the ground, the main stand remained unaltered by 1985.<ref name=\"i117\"/> Football ground writer [[Simon Inglis]] had described the view from the stand as \"like watching football from the [[cockpit]] of a [[Sopwith Camel]]\" because of its antiquated supports and struts.<ref>{{harvnb|Inglis|1987|p=118}}</ref> However, he also warned the club of a build-up of litter beneath the stand because of a gap between the seats. Some repair work was carried out, but in July 1984, the club was warned again, this time by a county council engineer, because of the club's plans to claim for ground improvements from the Football Trust. One letter from the council said the problems \"should be rectified as soon as possible\"; a second said: \"A carelessly discarded cigarette could give rise to a fire risk.\" In March 1985, the club's plans became more apparent when it took delivery of steel for a new roof.<ref>{{harvnb|Inglis|1987|p=119}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PeterJackson.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Peter Jackson (footballer born 1961)|Peter Jackson]] was presented with the league trophy before the final game.]]\nThe [[1984\u201385 in English football|1984\u201385]] season had been one of Bradford City's most successful seasons.

But a minute or so later there was suddenly a bigger whoosh of smoke so they went to get a steward. By the time they got back, the whole thing had taken off.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/572145/Bradford-City-Valley-Parade-Fire-Minute-Silence|title=EXCLUSIVE: Bradford's Valley Parade fire must be remembered like Hillsborough|first=Neil|last=Squires|date=23 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nOne witness saw paper or debris on fire, about {{convert|9|in|spell=in}} below the floor boards.<ref name=\"i361\"/> The stand seats did not have [[Stair riser|risers]]; this had allowed a large accumulation of rubbish and paper waste in the cavity space under the stand, which had not been cleared for many months.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nSpectators later spoke of initially feeling their feet becoming warmer; one of them ran to the back of the stand for a [[fire extinguisher]] but found none. A police officer shouted to a colleague for an [[extinguisher]]. His call was misheard, and instead the [[fire brigade]] were radioed.<ref name=\"i361\"/> The call was timed at 3:43&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"hideous images\"/> The fire escalated very rapidly, and flames became visible; police started to evacuate the stand. The blaze began to spread, and the roof and wooden stands were soon on fire. One eyewitness, Geoffrey Mitchell, told the [[BBC]]: \"It spread like a flash. I've never seen anything like it. The smoke was choking. You could hardly breathe.\"<ref name=\"on this day\"/> As spectators began to cascade over the wall separating the stand from the pitch, the linesman on that side of the pitch informed match [[referee (association football)|referee]] Norman Glover, who stopped the game with three minutes remaining before half-time. The original match referee (as named in the match programme) was Don Shaw, but he could not officiate due to an injury; Glover had been appointed to the match as replacement official. Shaw is still sometimes wrongly named as the match referee.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe stand's wooden roof, covered with layers of highly flammable [[Bituminous waterproofing|bituminous roofing felt]], offered no resistance to the flames. Burning timbers and molten materials fell from the roof onto the crowd and seating below, and dense black [[smoke]] enveloped a passageway behind the stand, where many spectators were trying to escape.<ref name=\"i361\"/> It took less than four minutes for the entire stand to be engulfed in flames.<ref name=\"hideous images\"/>\n\nThere were no extinguishers in the stand's passageway for fear of vandalism, and one spectator ran to the clubhouse to find one, but was overcome by smoke and impeded by others trying to escape. Supporters either ran upwards to the back of the stand or downwards to the pitch to escape. The stand had no perimeter fencing to keep fans from accessing the pitch, thus averting an instance of [[crush asphyxia]], as in the 1989 [[Hillsborough disaster]]. Footage of the accident at this point shows levels of confusion among the spectators \u2013 while many were trying to escape or to cross the pitch to the relative safety of the neighbouring stands, other spectators were observed cheering or waving to the still-rolling pitchside cameras. The lack of perimeter fencing kept the death toll down, and prevented it from reaching the hundreds or potentially the thousands. The Bradford City stadium fire was still the worst sporting tragedy of its kind in England at the time. Elsewhere in Britain, only the 66 deaths at [[1971 Ibrox disaster|Ibrox Stadium]] in [[Scotland]] 14 years earlier had seen a higher death toll.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nMost of the exits at the back were locked or shut, and there were no stewards present to open them, but seven were forced open or found open.<ref name=\"i120\"/><ref name=\"i361\"/> Three men smashed down one door and at least one exit was opened by people outside, which again helped prevent further deaths.<ref name=\"i361\"/><ref name=\"on this day\"/> Geoffrey Mitchell said: \"There was panic as fans stampeded to an exit which was padlocked.

One, now re-situated to that end of the stand where the fire began, is a sculpture donated on the initial re-opening of Valley Parade in December 1986 by Sylvia Graucob, a then [[Jersey]]-based former [[West Yorkshire]] woman. The other, situated by the main entrance, was donated by the club after its \u00a37.5 million (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|7.5|2002|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) rebuilding of the original main stand in 2002. It has a black [[marble]] fascia on which the names and ages of those that died are inscribed in gold, and a black marble platform on which people can leave flowers and mementos.

They were immediately promoted back to the Football League in 1988, and survived for 23 years before being relegated again in 2011. Although some attributed Lincoln City's sudden demise to the psychological effects of the fire on its players (together with the resignation of successful manager [[Colin Murphy (footballer born 1950)|Colin Murphy]] shortly before the fire), it symbolised the wider crisis that the introduction of new safety legislation brought to Lincoln's [[Sincil Bank]] home. \n\nThe timber construction of St. Andrew's Stand, Main Stand and the roof of its popular Railway End terrace were immediately condemned as fire hazards, which saw [[seating capacity]] briefly cut to nil. Lincoln City's board responded by committing \u00a31,100,000 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|1.1|1985|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) to their ground's renovation in the year that immediately followed the fire at Valley Parade, and over the following decade made improvements that eventually totalled \u00a33,000,000. After its renovation in 1990 they named the home end of their ground the 'Stacey-West Stand', in honour of Bill Stacey and Jim West, the two Lincoln City supporters who were amongst the 56 to die at Bradford.

Among the main outcomes of the inquiry were the banning of new [[wooden]] [[grandstand]]s at all UK sports grounds, the immediate closure of other wooden stands deemed unsafe and the banning of smoking in other wooden stands.\n\nAt the time of the disaster, many stadiums had perimeter fencing between the stands and the pitch to prevent [[Football hooliganism|incidents of football hooliganism]] \u2013 particularly [[pitch invasion]]s \u2013 which were rife during the 1980s. The main stand at Bradford was not surrounded by fencing, and therefore most of the spectators in it could escape onto the pitch \u2013 if they had been penned in then the death toll would inevitably have been in the hundreds if not the thousands. However, the turnstiles were locked and none of the stadium staff were present to unlock them, leaving no escape through the normal entrances and exits. Most of the fans who took this escape route were killed or seriously injured. Fans in the next stand (the \"Bradford End\") pulled down the fence separating them from the pitch.\n\nThe Popplewell Inquiry found that the club had been warned about the fire risk that the rubbish accumulating under the stand had posed. The stand had already been condemned, and the demolition teams were due to start work two days later. However, as there was no real precedent, most Bradfordians accepted that the fire was a terrible piece of misfortune. A discarded cigarette and a dilapidated wooden stand, which had survived because the club did not have the money to replace it, were considered to have conspired to cause the worst disaster in the history of the [[Football League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bradfordcityfire.co.uk/popplewell-inquiry/ |title=Popplewell Inquiry \u2013 Bradford City Fire |accessdate=31 March 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408222346/http://bradfordcityfire.co.uk/popplewell-inquiry/ |archivedate= 8 April 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Inquest and legal test case===\n\nIn July 1985 an inquest was held into the deaths; at the hearings the [[coroner]] James Turnbull recommended a death by misadventure outcome, which the jury agreed upon.

The book also raises concerns about the speed of the inquiry and the fact that it commenced a few weeks after the fire and lasted for only a few days, whereas other inquiries into similar incidents, pre and post the Bradford fire, have taken years to come to fruition and months to be heard. The fact the inquiry also embraced the investigation into another incident which happened on the same day, a riot in which a young boy died at Birmingham City, makes it seem more frivolous.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/22/bradford-city-fire-expert-new-investigation |title=Bradford fire: expert demands new investigation into blaze |first=Daniel |last=Taylor |date=22 April 2015 |accessdate=31 March 2017 |work=The Guardian |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401061319/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/22/bradford-city-fire-expert-new-investigation |archivedate= 1 April 2017 }}</ref>\n\nAdams also went on to state that \u201cI have read in some newspapers that he is being berated for his campaign to have a new inquiry.

It is found in the Piedmont Plateau and Blue Ridge mountain regions. Approximately 1 billion years ago a metamorphic change occurred during an event called the [[Grenville Orogeny]] and caused the rocks, which were originally [[sediment]], to compress into a form of rock called [[gneiss]] due to heat and pressure. Around 630 million years ago the Grenville mountains began to erode carrying sediments from streams to the sea. The gneiss formed from these sediments created the [[marble]], [[metaconglomerate]], [[phyllite]], [[quartzite]], [[schist]], and [[slate]] found in the Blue Ridge and Piedmont areas.\n\nThree separate orogeny events impacted the eastern portion of North America during the Paleozoic. From these orogeny came [[fold (geology)|folding]], [[Geologic fault|faulting]], and [[intrusion|igneous intrusions]] in the Piedmont, the Blue Ridge, the Valley and Ridge and the Appalachian Plateau.<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-3510 New Georgia Encyclopedia: Geologic History of Georgia: Overview] Accessed, May 22, 2007</ref>\n\n===Rocks and soils===\nGeorgia's Ridge and Valley lies in the northwestern portion of the state.<ref name=NETSTATE>[http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/ga_geography.htm State Flags Flowers Birds Symbols and Emblems State Quarters Geography and Maps Newspapers History and Economy for the 50 States], Accessed June 20, 2008</ref> The area was formed due to extreme folding and faulting events.

Hot and humid summers are typical, except at the highest elevations. The entire state, including the [[north Georgia mountains]], receives moderate to heavy precipitation, which varies from 45&nbsp;inches (1143&nbsp;mm) in central Georgia<ref>[http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0346?from=search Monthly Averages for Macon, GA] ''The Weather Channel''.</ref> to approximately 75&nbsp;inches (1905&nbsp;mm) around the Northeast part of the state.<ref>[http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0118?from=search Monthly Averages for Clayton, GA] ''The Weather Channel''.</ref> The degree to which the weather of a certain area of Georgia is subtropical depends not just on the [[latitude]], but also on how close it is to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] or [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the altitude. This is especially true in the mountainous areas in the northern part of the state, which are further away from ocean waters and can be up to 4500 feet (1350 m)  or higher above sea level.\n\nIn spite of having moderate weather compared to many other states, Georgia has occasional extreme weather. The highest temperature ever recorded is 112&nbsp;\u00b0F (44.4&nbsp;\u00b0C),<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/weather/wheat7.htm Each state's high temperature record] ''USA Today, last updated August 2006''.</ref> while the lowest ever recorded is -17&nbsp;\u00b0F (-27.2&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=\"Each state's low temperature record\"/> Georgia is one of the leading states in incidents of tornadoes. The areas closest to the Florida border get the same small [[Fujita scale|F0 and F1]] tornadoes associated with summer afternoon thunderstorms. However, it is very uncommon for tornadoes to become severe (over F3). As it is on the Atlantic coast, Georgia is also vulnerable to [[hurricane]]s, although the Georgia coastline only rarely experiences a direct hurricane strike. More common are hurricanes which strike the Florida panhandle, weaken over land, and bring strong [[tropical storm]] winds and heavy rain to the Georgia interior, as well as hurricanes that come close to the Georgia coastline, brushing the coast on their [[recurvature]] on the way up to hit [[the Carolinas]].\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, however, Georgia has had severe droughts, especially in 2007. Temperatures over 100 degrees have been recorded.\n\n==Political and human geography==\n[[Image:Georgia (U.S. state) counties map.png|thumb|Map of Georgia with named counties]]\n[[Image:GA-districts-110.png|thumb|upright|Map of Georgia congressional districts as of the [[110th Congress]]]]\n\nGeorgia is made up of more than 500 [[city|cities]]<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1340 Government and Laws of Georgia: Overview] Accessed November 25, 2007</ref> in 159 [[List of counties in Georgia (U.S. state)|counties]] within 13 [[Georgia Congressional Districts|congressional districts]].

All commissioners are elected by the voters of their county for terms that range between two and six years with most counties having terms lasting four years. Serving members wield both executive and legislative power in their county.\n\nMost of the 536 cities in Georgia are governed by a mayor-council system.

It is found in the Piedmont Plateau and Blue Ridge mountain regions. Approximately 1 billion years ago a metamorphic change occurred during an event called the [[Grenville Orogeny]] and caused the rocks, which were originally [[sediment]], to compress into a form of rock called [[gneiss]] due to heat and pressure. Around 630 million years ago the Grenville mountains began to erode carrying sediments from streams to the sea. The gneiss formed from these sediments created the [[marble]], [[metaconglomerate]], [[phyllite]], [[quartzite]], [[schist]], and [[slate]] found in the Blue Ridge and Piedmont areas.\n\nThree separate orogeny events impacted the eastern portion of North America during the Paleozoic. From these orogeny came [[fold (geology)|folding]], [[Geologic fault|faulting]], and [[intrusion|igneous intrusions]] in the Piedmont, the Blue Ridge, the Valley and Ridge and the Appalachian Plateau.<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-3510 New Georgia Encyclopedia: Geologic History of Georgia: Overview] Accessed, May 22, 2007</ref>\n\n===Rocks and soils===\nGeorgia's Ridge and Valley lies in the northwestern portion of the state.<ref name=NETSTATE>[http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/ga_geography.htm State Flags Flowers Birds Symbols and Emblems State Quarters Geography and Maps Newspapers History and Economy for the 50 States], Accessed June 20, 2008</ref> The area was formed due to extreme folding and faulting events.

Hot and humid summers are typical, except at the highest elevations. The entire state, including the [[north Georgia mountains]], receives moderate to heavy precipitation, which varies from 45&nbsp;inches (1143&nbsp;mm) in central Georgia<ref>[http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0346?from=search Monthly Averages for Macon, GA] ''The Weather Channel''.</ref> to approximately 75&nbsp;inches (1905&nbsp;mm) around the Northeast part of the state.<ref>[http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0118?from=search Monthly Averages for Clayton, GA] ''The Weather Channel''.</ref> The degree to which the weather of a certain area of Georgia is subtropical depends not just on the [[latitude]], but also on how close it is to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] or [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the altitude. This is especially true in the mountainous areas in the northern part of the state, which are further away from ocean waters and can be up to 4500 feet (1350 m)  or higher above sea level.\n\nIn spite of having moderate weather compared to many other states, Georgia has occasional extreme weather.

The areas closest to the Florida border get the same small [[Fujita scale|F0 and F1]] tornadoes associated with summer afternoon thunderstorms. However, it is very uncommon for tornadoes to become severe (over F3). As it is on the Atlantic coast, Georgia is also vulnerable to [[hurricane]]s, although the Georgia coastline only rarely experiences a direct hurricane strike. More common are hurricanes which strike the Florida panhandle, weaken over land, and bring strong [[tropical storm]] winds and heavy rain to the Georgia interior, as well as hurricanes that come close to the Georgia coastline, brushing the coast on their [[recurvature]] on the way up to hit [[the Carolinas]].\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, however, Georgia has had severe droughts, especially in 2007. Temperatures over 100 degrees have been recorded.\n\n==Political and human geography==\n[[Image:Georgia (U.S. state) counties map.png|thumb|Map of Georgia with named counties]]\n[[Image:GA-districts-110.png|thumb|upright|Map of Georgia congressional districts as of the [[110th Congress]]]]\n\nGeorgia is made up of more than 500 [[city|cities]]<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1340 Government and Laws of Georgia: Overview] Accessed November 25, 2007</ref> in 159 [[List of counties in Georgia (U.S. state)|counties]] within 13 [[Georgia Congressional Districts|congressional districts]].

The team compete in [[League Two]], the fourth tier of the [[English football league system]]. They are the only professional football club in England to wear [[Wine (color)|claret]] and [[amber (color)|amber]], and have worn these colours throughout their history. They have though been known by various nicknames, with the \"[[Bantam (poultry)|Bantams]]\" being the most commonly used nickname as it appears on the current club crest. Supporters hold [[West Yorkshire derby]] rivalries with [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], as well as an historic [[Bradford derby]] rivalry with the now non-league side [[Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C.|Bradford (Park Avenue)]]. The club's home ground is the 25,136-capacity [[Valley Parade]], which was the site of the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] on 11 May 1985, which took the lives of 56 supporters.\n\nThe club was founded in 1903 and immediately elected into the [[Football League Second Division]]. Promotion to the top tier followed as they won the 1907\u201308 Second Division title and then they went on to win the [[1911 FA Cup Final]], which remains the club's only major honour. They were relegated in 1922 and again in 1927, before winning the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] title in 1928\u201329. Another relegation in 1937 did allow the club to go on to win the [[Football League Third Division North Cup|Third Division North Cup]] in 1939, however a further relegation followed in 1962 to leave the club in the newly created [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. They secured promotions back into the third tier in 1969 and 1977, but were relegated in 1972 and 1978. They found success in the 1980s under the stewardship of first [[Roy McFarland]] and then [[Trevor Cherry]], winning promotion in 1981\u201382 and following this up with the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] title in 1984\u201385, though they were relegated out of the Second Division in 1990.\n\nBradford were promoted back into the second tier via the [[1996 Football League Second Division play-off Final|play-offs in 1996]], before securing another promotion in 1998\u201399 to reach the [[Premier League]], marking a return to the top-flight after a 77-year absence. They entered Europe and reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in 2000\u201301, but ended the campaign with relegation out of the Premier League. A succession of financial crises followed as the club entered [[Administration (British football)|administration]] twice in two years and further relegations followed in 2004 and 2007 to leave the club back in the fourth tier. They found success under the management of [[Phil Parkinson]] by reaching the [[2013 Football League Cup Final|2013 League Cup final]] and then going on to win that year's [[2013 Football League Two play-off Final|League Two play-off final]], but were relegated out of [[EFL League One|League One]] in 2019.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Bradford City A.F.C.}}\n{{see also|List of Bradford City A.F.C. seasons}}\n[[File:Bradford1911.jpg|thumb|right|The Bradford City team which won the [[1911 FA Cup Final|1911 FA Cup]]]]\nBradford City were formed in 1903 as a result of a series of meetings called by James Whyte, a sub-editor of the ''Bradford Observer'', with [[The Football Association|Football Association]] representatives and officials at [[Manningham F.C.]], a [[rugby league]] side.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Frost\n|first=Terry\n|title=Bradford City A Complete Record 1903\u20131988\n|publisher=Breedon Books Sport\n|year=1988\n|page=11\n|isbn=0-907969-38-0}}</ref> [[The Football League]] saw the invitation as a chance to promote association football in the rugby league-dominated county of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].

The team compete in [[League Two]], the fourth tier of the [[English football league system]]. They are the only professional football club in England to wear [[Wine (color)|claret]] and [[amber (color)|amber]], and have worn these colours throughout their history. They have though been known by various nicknames, with the \"[[Bantam (poultry)|Bantams]]\" being the most commonly used nickname as it appears on the current club crest. Supporters hold [[West Yorkshire derby]] rivalries with [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], as well as an historic [[Bradford derby]] rivalry with the now non-league side [[Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C.|Bradford (Park Avenue)]]. The club's home ground is the 25,136-capacity [[Valley Parade]], which was the site of the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] on 11 May 1985, which took the lives of 56 supporters.\n\nThe club was founded in 1903 and immediately elected into the [[Football League Second Division]]. Promotion to the top tier followed as they won the 1907\u201308 Second Division title and then they went on to win the [[1911 FA Cup Final]], which remains the club's only major honour. They were relegated in 1922 and again in 1927, before winning the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] title in 1928\u201329. Another relegation in 1937 did allow the club to go on to win the [[Football League Third Division North Cup|Third Division North Cup]] in 1939, however a further relegation followed in 1962 to leave the club in the newly created [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. They secured promotions back into the third tier in 1969 and 1977, but were relegated in 1972 and 1978. They found success in the 1980s under the stewardship of first [[Roy McFarland]] and then [[Trevor Cherry]], winning promotion in 1981\u201382 and following this up with the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] title in 1984\u201385, though they were relegated out of the Second Division in 1990.\n\nBradford were promoted back into the second tier via the [[1996 Football League Second Division play-off Final|play-offs in 1996]], before securing another promotion in 1998\u201399 to reach the [[Premier League]], marking a return to the top-flight after a 77-year absence. They entered Europe and reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in 2000\u201301, but ended the campaign with relegation out of the Premier League. A succession of financial crises followed as the club entered [[Administration (British football)|administration]] twice in two years and further relegations followed in 2004 and 2007 to leave the club back in the fourth tier. They found success under the management of [[Phil Parkinson]] by reaching the [[2013 Football League Cup Final|2013 League Cup final]] and then going on to win that year's [[2013 Football League Two play-off Final|League Two play-off final]], but were relegated out of [[EFL League One|League One]] in 2019.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Bradford City A.F.C.}}\n{{see also|List of Bradford City A.F.C. seasons}}\n[[File:Bradford1911.jpg|thumb|right|The Bradford City team which won the [[1911 FA Cup Final|1911 FA Cup]]]]\nBradford City were formed in 1903 as a result of a series of meetings called by James Whyte, a sub-editor of the ''Bradford Observer'', with [[The Football Association|Football Association]] representatives and officials at [[Manningham F.C.]], a [[rugby league]] side.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Frost\n|first=Terry\n|title=Bradford City A Complete Record 1903\u20131988\n|publisher=Breedon Books Sport\n|year=1988\n|page=11\n|isbn=0-907969-38-0}}</ref> [[The Football League]] saw the invitation as a chance to promote association football in the rugby league-dominated county of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].

Both Manningham, from 1886, and Bradford City, from 1903 to 1908, used the barracks as changing and club rooms.\n\nBradford City has worn claret and amber, with either white or black, since it was founded.
