Khitruk had not seen the [[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Disney adaptations]] while working on his own. He created the prototype drawings of the characters together with Vladimir Zuikov, a fellow animator from ''[[Film, Film, Film]]''.<ref name=int/>\n\nKhitruk followed the original book by [[A. A. Milne]] and based his first two parts of the trilogy on the Pooh's love for honey. However, while Milne accentuated the relationships between a boy ([[Christopher Robin]]) and his favorite toy Pooh, Khitruk removed Robin and made Pooh the leading character; his narrator is a \"true\" narrator who has no relation to the story whatsoever. Pooh is balanced by the Piglet; they are best friends and are present in all parts of the story. While Pooh always takes the initiative, he often seeks advice and help from the Piglet.<ref name=comp/> The main reason to remove Robin was to exclude a vastly superior character (a human), and put all others at an equal level.<ref name=int/>\n\nKhitruk followed his style and drew all scenes in two dimensions. His animation was relatively simple and slowly paced compared to other Milne adaptations. Instead, Khitruk put much emphasis on the dialogues and timing \u2013 every move of his characters and every character line are intended to bring hidden details and irony to viewers of all ages.<ref name=comp/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vladimir Osenev]] as the narrator. Osenev was a serious stage actor, who first despised the \"childish\" text and softened only after seeing the final result. Khitruk cast him because of his [[timbre]] and sarcasm.<ref name=int2/>  \n* [[Yevgeny Leonov]] as [[Winnie-the-Pooh]]. Khitruk tried several prominent actors without success \u2013 he favored Leonov, yet thought that his voice was too low. The sound engineer Georgy Martynyuk found a solution in speeding up his voice records. The same technique was used for Savvina who played the Piglet.<ref name=int2/><ref name=savvina/> \n* [[Iya Savvina]] as [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]]. Knowing that Savvina is a big fan of the Winnie-the-Pooh story, Khitruk invited her to review his first draft, and in the process cast her as the Piglet. Savvina based her intonation on [[Bella Akhmadulina]].<ref name=int2/><ref name=savvina/>\n\n==Legacy and awards==\nIn 1976 Khitruk was awarded the [[USSR State Prize]] for the ''Winnie-the-Pooh'' trilogy.<ref name=award/> The animation characters, as designed by Khitruk's team, are featured on the [[:File:1988 CPA 5916.jpg|1988 Soviet]] and [[:File:Stamp of Russia 2012 No 1652 Winnie-the-Pooh.jpg|2012 Russian]] postal stamps; they are permanently painted on a [[:File:RIAN archive 417728 The first of the \"Fairy Streetcar\" project launched in Sokolniki.jpg|public streetcar]] running through the [[Sokolniki Park]], and their sculptures are installed in [[Ramenki District]] in Moscow.<ref name=sculpt/>\n\nWhen Khitruk visited the Disney Studios, [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], the author of ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]'' that won the 1968 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]], told him that he liked the Soviet version better than his own.<ref name=award/><ref name=disney/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Soyuzmultfilm]]\n* [[Winnie-the-Pooh]]\n* [[A.

In the US, public and private institutions have different authorities governing collective bargaining rights. In [[Public university|public universities]], state labor laws determine collective bargaining and employee recognition. In [[Private university|private universities]], the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) has power to determine whether graduate students are considered employees, which would give them collective bargaining rights. The NLRB ruled that graduate students at private universities are employees in a 3\u20131 decision on August 23, 2016,<ref>https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-student-assistants-covered-nlra-0</ref> setting the stage for widespread unionization efforts at universities such as Columbia, University of Chicago, Duke, Yale, Cornell, and Harvard.\n\nIn the U.S., many university administrators and university associations like the [[Association of American Universities]] have vigorously opposed the unionization of graduate student employees on their campuses through legal challenges on the grounds that unionization threatens academic freedom of institutions and harms the relationship between faculty and students, although recent research suggests that unionization neither negatively affects academic freedom nor harms faculty-student relationships.<ref name=Rogers2013 >Rogers, S. E., Eaton, A.E., and Voos, P.B. (2013). \"Effects of Unionization on Graduate Student Employees: Faculty-Student Relations, Academic Freedom, and Pay.\" ''ILR Review'', 66(2), 487\u2013510</ref> Many faculty associations like the [[American Association of University Professors]] support the right of graduate students to form unions.\n\nIn Finland and Sweden, for instance, graduate students are often regular employees and are represented by their respective professional unions, such as member unions of [[Confederation of Unions for Academic Professionals in Finland|Akava]] in Finland.<ref>http://www.uva.fi/fi/for/student/guidance/general/career/unions/</ref>\n\n==United States==\nThe main issue over graduate student employee unionization in the United States is whether academic student employees should be classified as employees or students, because the recognition of employee status would give graduate students the right to form a union and to bargain collectively. The position of many universities is that the work graduate student employees do is so intertwined with their professional education that collective bargaining will harm the educational process.{{Cn|date=March 2017}} Supporters of unionization argue that graduate employees' work is primarily an economic relationship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/37393-graduate-students-are-workers-the-decades-long-fight-for-graduate-unions-and-the-path-forward|title=Graduate Students Are Workers: The Decades-Long Fight for Graduate Unions, and the Path Forward|last=Schwartz-Weinstein|first=Zack|website=Truthout |language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-10}}</ref> They point especially to universities' use of Teaching Assistants as part of a wider trend away from full-time, tenured faculty.\n\nFor tax purposes, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] considers the compensation of graduate student employees to be wages. When graduate students receive payment for teaching, it is not taxed on a 1042-S form (for scholarships), but on a W-2 (which is the form for employment income). The income from teaching is taxed differently from scholarships, and treated like employment income.\n\n===Public universities===\nAcademic student employees who may be either graduate or undergraduate students at public colleges and universities in the United States are covered by state collective bargaining laws, where these laws exist. Graduate students employees are excluded from Federal bargaining rights under the [[Taft-Hartley Act|Taft-Hartley Act's]] exclusion of state and local government employees.\n\nThe various state laws differ on which subgroups of academic student employees may bargain collectively, and a few state laws explicitly exclude them from bargaining. Some states have extended collective bargaining rights to graduate employees in response to unionization campaigns. As of 2004, 14 states including California and New York explicitly give collective bargaining rights to academic student employees; 11 states like Connecticut and New Mexico give public university employees the right to collectively bargain, but leaves eligibility for graduate employees unstated; Ohio is the only state to exclude collective bargaining rights for graduate student employees while still providing the same rights to other university employees; and 23 states deny collective bargaining rights for all university employees.<ref name=Hutchens2003-4 >Hutchens, N.H. and Hutchens, M.B.

''Gonzaga Law Review'', 39(1), 105\u2013130</ref>\n\n===Private universities===\nGraduate student employees at private colleges and universities in the United States are covered by the [[National Labor Relations Act]]. Initially, the [[National Labor Relations Board|NLRB]] rejected all private university employees including academic employees from being protected by the NLRA. In the ''Trustees of Columbia'' (1951) decision, the NLRB held that the act did not have jurisdiction in private universities because universities focus primarily on education and are not associated with significant commercial activity.<ref name=Singh2006>Singh, P., Zinni, D.M., and MacLennan, A.F. (2006). Graduate Student Unions in the United States. ''Journal of Labor Research'', 27(1), 55\u201373</ref> However, two decades later in ''Cornell v NLRB'' (1970), the NLRB reversed ''Columbia'', holding that due to changing economic realities and difficulties in distinguishing between commercial and noncommercial activities in private universities, the NLRA covers employees in private education institutions.<ref name=Singh2006 />\n\nFor the employee status of academic student employees, the NLRB's rulings have shifted in recent decades. In these decisions, the NLRB has grappled with two main conflicting legal arguments. The \"primary purpose\" approach holds that graduate students are not employees because the primary purpose of graduate students is to fulfill the role of a student rather than that of an employee. In contrast, the \"compensated services\" approach holds that graduate students are employees because they perform services for others and have distinct manager-worker relations with university administrators.\n\nThe \"primary purpose\" doctrine was first applied to graduate students in ''Adelphi University and Adelphi University Chapter, American Association of University Professors'' (1972) (''Adelphi University'') decision, in which the NLRB rejected graduate teaching and research assistants from collectively bargaining with faculty.<ref name=Epstein2005>Epstein, R.A.

Legal Comment'', 20(1), 157\u2013198</ref>\n\nAfter years of rejecting employee status to graduate students, the NLRB overturned the ''Adelphi University'' (1972) decision. Under ''New York University and International Union, United Automobile Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, AFL-CIO'' (2000) (''NYU''), the NLRB applied the \"compensated services\" legal approach, ruling for the first time that graduate students at private universities were considered employees, and hence protected by the NLRA.<ref name=Epstein2005 /> However, the NLRB later returned to its \"primary purpose\" approach in 2004 after a new Republican-appointed majority reversed ''NYU''. In ''Brown University and International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW AFL-CIO'' (2004) (''Brown University''), the NLRB's 3\u20132 majority ruled that graduate students in private universities are not considered employees.<ref name=Epstein2005 />\n\nIn recent years, NYU's graduate student union filed a case seeking to overturn ''Brown University'', which in 2012 the NLRB announced that it would reconsider.<ref name=Jaschik2012>Jaschik, S.

Although graduate students in private colleges were active in union organizing campaigns, they were greatly restricted by the ''Columbia'' (1951) and later ''Adelphi University'' (1972) decisions, which both barred the NLRA from protecting graduate students in private universities.

The position of many universities is that the work graduate student employees do is so intertwined with their professional education that collective bargaining will harm the educational process.{{Cn|date=March 2017}} Supporters of unionization argue that graduate employees' work is primarily an economic relationship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/37393-graduate-students-are-workers-the-decades-long-fight-for-graduate-unions-and-the-path-forward|title=Graduate Students Are Workers: The Decades-Long Fight for Graduate Unions, and the Path Forward|last=Schwartz-Weinstein|first=Zack|website=Truthout |language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-10}}</ref> They point especially to universities' use of Teaching Assistants as part of a wider trend away from full-time, tenured faculty.\n\nFor tax purposes, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] considers the compensation of graduate student employees to be wages. When graduate students receive payment for teaching, it is not taxed on a 1042-S form (for scholarships), but on a W-2 (which is the form for employment income). The income from teaching is taxed differently from scholarships, and treated like employment income.\n\n===Public universities===\nAcademic student employees who may be either graduate or undergraduate students at public colleges and universities in the United States are covered by state collective bargaining laws, where these laws exist. Graduate students employees are excluded from Federal bargaining rights under the [[Taft-Hartley Act|Taft-Hartley Act's]] exclusion of state and local government employees.\n\nThe various state laws differ on which subgroups of academic student employees may bargain collectively, and a few state laws explicitly exclude them from bargaining. Some states have extended collective bargaining rights to graduate employees in response to unionization campaigns. As of 2004, 14 states including California and New York explicitly give collective bargaining rights to academic student employees; 11 states like Connecticut and New Mexico give public university employees the right to collectively bargain, but leaves eligibility for graduate employees unstated; Ohio is the only state to exclude collective bargaining rights for graduate student employees while still providing the same rights to other university employees; and 23 states deny collective bargaining rights for all university employees.<ref name=Hutchens2003-4 >Hutchens, N.H. and Hutchens, M.B.

''Gonzaga Law Review'', 39(1), 105\u2013130</ref>\n\n===Private universities===\nGraduate student employees at private colleges and universities in the United States are covered by the [[National Labor Relations Act]]. Initially, the [[National Labor Relations Board|NLRB]] rejected all private university employees including academic employees from being protected by the NLRA. In the ''Trustees of Columbia'' (1951) decision, the NLRB held that the act did not have jurisdiction in private universities because universities focus primarily on education and are not associated with significant commercial activity.<ref name=Singh2006>Singh, P., Zinni, D.M., and MacLennan, A.F. (2006). Graduate Student Unions in the United States. ''Journal of Labor Research'', 27(1), 55\u201373</ref> However, two decades later in ''Cornell v NLRB'' (1970), the NLRB reversed ''Columbia'', holding that due to changing economic realities and difficulties in distinguishing between commercial and noncommercial activities in private universities, the NLRA covers employees in private education institutions.<ref name=Singh2006 />\n\nFor the employee status of academic student employees, the NLRB's rulings have shifted in recent decades. In these decisions, the NLRB has grappled with two main conflicting legal arguments. The \"primary purpose\" approach holds that graduate students are not employees because the primary purpose of graduate students is to fulfill the role of a student rather than that of an employee. In contrast, the \"compensated services\" approach holds that graduate students are employees because they perform services for others and have distinct manager-worker relations with university administrators.\n\nThe \"primary purpose\" doctrine was first applied to graduate students in ''Adelphi University and Adelphi University Chapter, American Association of University Professors'' (1972) (''Adelphi University'') decision, in which the NLRB rejected graduate teaching and research assistants from collectively bargaining with faculty.<ref name=Epstein2005>Epstein, R.A.

Legal Comment'', 20(1), 157\u2013198</ref>\n\nAfter years of rejecting employee status to graduate students, the NLRB overturned the ''Adelphi University'' (1972) decision. Under ''New York University and International Union, United Automobile Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, AFL-CIO'' (2000) (''NYU''), the NLRB applied the \"compensated services\" legal approach, ruling for the first time that graduate students at private universities were considered employees, and hence protected by the NLRA.<ref name=Epstein2005 /> However, the NLRB later returned to its \"primary purpose\" approach in 2004 after a new Republican-appointed majority reversed ''NYU''. In ''Brown University and International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW AFL-CIO'' (2004) (''Brown University''), the NLRB's 3\u20132 majority ruled that graduate students in private universities are not considered employees.<ref name=Epstein2005 />\n\nIn recent years, NYU's graduate student union filed a case seeking to overturn ''Brown University'', which in 2012 the NLRB announced that it would reconsider.<ref name=Jaschik2012>Jaschik, S.

Graduate students became more inclined to recognize themselves as employees, and turned towards unionization to better demand bread and butter issues such as increased stipends or wages and benefits such as health insurance and child care.\n\nAdditionally, increased labor union activity in academic sectors has played a key role in graduate employee unionization. During the sizable growth in the 1990s, graduate students were better able to access legal support, financial resources, and networking opportunities provided by the new leadership in the [[AFL CIO|AFL-CIO]] and by unions such as [[United Automobile Workers|UAW]]. The newly elected 1995 AFL-CIO leadership engaged college students by creating a Union Summer Internships program in 1996 to train students in union organizing.<ref name=Dixon2008 /> The AFL-CIO also sent [[Organizing Institute]] recruiters onto college campuses to build pro-labor solidarity networks and share information with student organizers about other universities' organizing efforts.<ref name=Dixon2008 />  Similarly, UAW plays a significant role in supporting graduate student organizers, some of whom see UAW as the most responsive union to academic student employees' needs in comparison with traditional education unions.<ref>Smallwood, S.
