{"title_page": "UW\u2013Madison Geology Museum", "text_new": "[[File:Geology Museum.jpg|right]]\nThe '''UW\u2013Madison Geology Museum''' (UWGM) is a geology and paleontology museum housed in Weeks Hall, in the southwest part of the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] campus. The museum's main undertakings are exhibits, outreach to the public, and research. It has the second highest attendance of any museum at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], exceeded only by the [[Chazen Museum of Art]]. The museum charges no admission.\n\n== History ==\nThe museum was founded in the 19th century, and for many years resided with the earth science departments in [[University of Wisconsin Science Hall|Science Hall]]. After the construction of Weeks Hall in the 1970s, the museum moved to its present location in 1981.\n\n== Exhibits ==\nAlmost 1,000 items are on display in 66 exhibits covering {{convert|3000|sqft|m2}}. Major sections are devoted to rocks and minerals, invertebrate and fish fossils, and vertebrate fossils. There are also cases of glaciers, meteorites, and fossil plants.\n\nHighlights of the museum include:\n\n=== Rocks ===\n* An excellent specimen of the mineral [[kermesite]];\n* Two [[glacial erratic]] pieces of [[copper]] weighing hundreds of pounds each;\n* A case exhibiting 85 [[mineral]]s from the recent Greiner donation;\n* A [[blacklight]] room that shines both long- and short-wave [[ultraviolet]] onto rocks, demonstrating [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]];\n* A walk-through model of a [[limestone]] cave, complete with sound effects.\n\n=== Fossils ===\n* A slab of sea floor from the [[Cretaceous]] period in [[Texas]], containing impressions of many clams;\n* Shells of giant the [[cephalopod]] ''[[Endoceras]]'' from Wisconsin;\n* The [[Biological type|type specimen]] of the fossil [[cephalopod]] ''[[Actinoceras]] beloitense''.\n* A window showing the workings of the preparation laboratory, where [[vertebrate]] fossils collected in the field are cleaned for storage or display;\n* Animals from the [[Burgess Shale]], including the [[chordate]] ''[[Pikaia]]'', the [[hyolith]] ''[[Haplophrentis]]'', and fragments of the [[stem group|stem]]-[[arthropod]] ''[[Anomalocaris]]'';\n* Several skeletons from the [[Cretaceous]] [[Niobrara Formation|Niobrara]] chalk of [[Kansas]]:\n** ''[[Hesperornis]]'', a swimming bird with teeth;\n** A slab of chalk containing the [[shark]] ''[[Squalicorax]]'', including its teeth, vertebrae, and some bones from its last meal; [[File:Boaz Mastodon.jpg|thumb|right|The Boaz mastodon in the vertebrate fossil room]]\n** An exceptionally well-preserved slab of a floating colony of the [[crinoid|sea lily]] ''[[Uintacrinus]]'';\n** A nearly complete skeleton of the [[mosasaur]] ''[[Platecarpus]]'', suspended from the ceiling. It has some distinctive [[pathology|pathologies]], including injured ribs and a rear right flipper with arthritis;\n** A suspended replica of the [[pterosaur]] ''[[Pteranodon]]'';\n* Vertebrate skeletons from other places:\n** The [[Permian]] reptile ''[[Captorhinus]]'';\n** A composite skeleton of the [[hadrosaurid|duck-billed dinosaur]] ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', the first dinosaur on display in Wisconsin;\n** The skeleton of an [[American mastodon]], a [[Pleistocene]] relative of elephants.  It is a composite of bones from two individuals, both found in the 1890s in southwestern Wisconsin.  Since one was found near the village of [[Boaz, Wisconsin|Boaz]], the entire composite was once called the [[Boaz mastodon]].\n\n=== Biosignatures exhibit ===\nThis exhibit highlights the chronology of the Earth and the signal left by life on the planet.  Features include\n* A block containing debris from the [[Sudbury Basin|Sudbury impact]] 1.85 billion years ago\n* [[Stromatolite]]s from the [[Ordovician]] of southwestern [[Wisconsin]]\n* Soft-bodied fossils, such as the enigmatic [[Grypania]] and a possible [[Silurian]]-age [[leech]]. \n* A large [[Winogradsky column]]\n[[File:Probable leech from the Waukesha Biota.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Annelid]] worm, possibly the earliest [[leech]], from the [[Silurian]] [[Waukesha Biota]], Wisconsin.]]\n\n=== Extraterrestrial exhibits ===\n* A large fragment of the Canyon Diablo meteorite that left [[Meteor Crater]] in Arizona.\n* Several small meteorites, both stony and metallic, that fell in Wisconsin.\n\n== Outreach ==\n\nEvery year hundreds of school groups from around the state tour the museum, led by student guides. Staff and students at the museum also travel to schools in the area to teach children and their teachers about geology.\n\nThe museum hosts periodic family events, such as the annual Open House. These sometimes have a special theme, such as the one in 2006 that focused on [[pterosaur]]s and in 2009 on the [[Mazon Creek fossils]] which includes the '''Tully Monster''' ([[Tullimonstrum gregarium]]).\n\n== Research ==\n[[File:Wyoming 061504.JPG|right|thumb|Wyoming dig]]\nThe museum has conducted fossil digs in many Western states. The Late Cretaceous [[Niobrara Formation|Niobrara]] Formation in Kansas has yielded many marine fossils. The [[Hell Creek Formation]] in [[Montana]] and [[South Dakota]] has produced [[hadrosaurid|duck-billed]], [[ceratopsian|horned]], and [[tyrannosaurid]] dinosaurs, as well as some noteworthy fish.\n\nThere is an ongoing summer dig in the [[Jurassic]] [[Morrison Formation]] in [[Wyoming]], which has produced [[sauropod]] and [[theropod]] dinosaurs, as well as other remarkable vertebrates.\n\nThe museum also conducts local research, such as the study of [[Pleistocene]] [[mammal]] fossils from [[Midwestern]] caves.\n\n== Collections ==\nLike most museums, the Geology Museum has far more specimens stored in its collections than on display. It holds a majority of the meteorites ever collected in Wisconsin, and an abundance of rocks and minerals collected by faculty and donated by friends of the museum.\n\nThe museum's fossils include impressive collections from the White River Badlands, the Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation, and a remarkable [[Silurian]] soft-bodied fauna from a quarry near [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]].\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://geoscience.wisc.edu/museum/ UW\u2013Madison Geology Museum website]\n\n{{coord|43.070661|-89.406411|region:US_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n{{University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:UW-Madison Geology Museum}}\n[[Category:Museums in Madison, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison|Geology Museum]]\n[[Category:Geology museums in the United States]]\n[[Category:Natural history museums in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:University museums in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Dinosaur museums in the United States]]\n[[Category:Paleontology in Wisconsin]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Geology Museum.jpg|right]]\nThe '''UW\u2013Madison Geology Museum''' (UWGM) is a geology and paleontology museum housed in Weeks Hall, in the southwest part of the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] campus.

There are also cases of glaciers, meteorites, and fossil plants.\n\nHighlights of the museum include:\n\n=== Rocks ===\n* An excellent specimen of the mineral [[kermesite]];\n* Two [[glacial erratic]] pieces of [[copper]] weighing hundreds of pounds each;\n* A case exhibiting 85 [[mineral]]s from the recent Greiner donation;\n* A [[blacklight]] room that shines both long- and short-wave [[ultraviolet]] onto rocks, demonstrating [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]];\n* A walk-through model of a [[limestone]] cave, complete with sound effects.\n\n=== Fossils ===\n* A slab of sea floor from the [[Cretaceous]] period in [[Texas]], containing impressions of many clams;\n* Shells of giant the [[cephalopod]] ''[[Endoceras]]'' from Wisconsin;\n* The [[Biological type|type specimen]] of the fossil [[cephalopod]] ''[[Actinoceras]] beloitense''.\n* A window showing the workings of the preparation laboratory, where [[vertebrate]] fossils collected in the field are cleaned for storage or display;\n* Animals from the [[Burgess Shale]], including the [[chordate]] ''[[Pikaia]]'', the [[hyolith]] ''[[Haplophrentis]]'', and fragments of the [[stem group|stem]]-[[arthropod]] ''[[Anomalocaris]]'';\n* Several skeletons from the [[Cretaceous]] [[Niobrara Formation|Niobrara]] chalk of [[Kansas]]:\n** ''[[Hesperornis]]'', a swimming bird with teeth;\n** A slab of chalk containing the [[shark]] ''[[Squalicorax]]'', including its teeth, vertebrae, and some bones from its last meal; [[File:Boaz Mastodon.jpg|thumb|right|The Boaz mastodon in the vertebrate fossil room]]\n** An exceptionally well-preserved slab of a floating colony of the [[crinoid|sea lily]] ''[[Uintacrinus]]'';\n** A nearly complete skeleton of the [[mosasaur]] ''[[Platecarpus]]'', suspended from the ceiling. It has some distinctive [[pathology|pathologies]], including injured ribs and a rear right flipper with arthritis;\n** A suspended replica of the [[pterosaur]] ''[[Pteranodon]]'';\n* Vertebrate skeletons from other places:\n** The [[Permian]] reptile ''[[Captorhinus]]'';\n** A composite skeleton of the [[hadrosaurid|duck-billed dinosaur]] ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', the first dinosaur on display in Wisconsin;\n** The skeleton of an [[American mastodon]], a [[Pleistocene]] relative of elephants.  It is a composite of bones from two individuals, both found in the 1890s in southwestern Wisconsin.  Since one was found near the village of [[Boaz, Wisconsin|Boaz]], the entire composite was once called the [[Boaz mastodon]].\n\n=== Biosignatures exhibit ===\nThis exhibit highlights the chronology of the Earth and the signal left by life on the planet.  Features include\n* A block containing debris from the [[Sudbury Basin|Sudbury impact]] 1.85 billion years ago\n* [[Stromatolite]]s from the [[Ordovician]] of southwestern [[Wisconsin]]\n* Soft-bodied fossils, such as the enigmatic [[Grypania]] and a possible [[Silurian]]-age [[leech]]. \n* A large [[Winogradsky column]]\n[[File:Probable leech from the Waukesha Biota.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Annelid]] worm, possibly the earliest [[leech]], from the [[Silurian]] [[Waukesha Biota]], Wisconsin.]]\n\n=== Extraterrestrial exhibits ===\n* A large fragment of the Canyon Diablo meteorite that left [[Meteor Crater]] in Arizona.\n* Several small meteorites, both stony and metallic, that fell in Wisconsin.\n\n== Outreach ==\n\nEvery year hundreds of school groups from around the state tour the museum, led by student guides. Staff and students at the museum also travel to schools in the area to teach children and their teachers about geology.\n\nThe museum hosts periodic family events, such as the annual Open House. These sometimes have a special theme, such as the one in 2006 that focused on [[pterosaur]]s and in 2009 on the [[Mazon Creek fossils]] which includes the '''Tully Monster''' ([[Tullimonstrum gregarium]]).\n\n== Research ==\n[[File:Wyoming 061504.JPG|right|thumb|Wyoming dig]]\nThe museum has conducted fossil digs in many Western states. The Late Cretaceous [[Niobrara Formation|Niobrara]] Formation in Kansas has yielded many marine fossils. The [[Hell Creek Formation]] in [[Montana]] and [[South Dakota]] has produced [[hadrosaurid|duck-billed]], [[ceratopsian|horned]], and [[tyrannosaurid]] dinosaurs, as well as some noteworthy fish.\n\nThere is an ongoing summer dig in the [[Jurassic]] [[Morrison Formation]] in [[Wyoming]], which has produced [[sauropod]] and [[theropod]] dinosaurs, as well as other remarkable vertebrates.\n\nThe museum also conducts local research, such as the study of [[Pleistocene]] [[mammal]] fossils from [[Midwestern]] caves.\n\n== Collections ==\nLike most museums, the Geology Museum has far more specimens stored in its collections than on display. It holds a majority of the meteorites ever collected in Wisconsin, and an abundance of rocks and minerals collected by faculty and donated by friends of the museum.\n\nThe museum's fossils include impressive collections from the White River Badlands, the Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation, and a remarkable [[Silurian]] soft-bodied fauna from a quarry near [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]].\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://geoscience.wisc.edu/museum/ UW\u2013Madison Geology Museum website]\n\n{{coord|43.070661|-89.406411|region:US_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n{{University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:UW-Madison Geology Museum}}\n[[Category:Museums in Madison, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison|Geology Museum]]\n[[Category:Geology museums in the United States]]\n[[Category:Natural history museums in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:University museums in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Dinosaur museums in the United States]]\n[[Category:Paleontology in Wisconsin]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UW%E2%80%93Madison_Geology_Museum"}

The museum seeks to promote public understanding of prehistory through interpretive exhibits, educational programs, collections, and research. The museum is located near many paleontological and archaeological sites in a region known as Castle Country, notably in the [[San Rafael Swell]] and nearby canyons throughout the [[Book Cliffs]] area such as [[Nine Mile Canyon]] and [[Range Creek]] Canyon.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:raptorfull.jpg| thumb| right | Mounted ''[[Utahraptor]]'' in the museum's Hall of Dinosaurs]]\nThe Prehistoric Museum was established in 1961 as a cooperative effort by the former [[College of Eastern Utah]] and the community of Price. On May 8, 1961, the Board of Regents established the museum.  At that time, funding for the museum was supplied by the geology department at the college. The museum officially opened to the public on June 3, 1961, on the second floor of the Price Municipal Building in a small converted conference room.  After expanding into the hallways of the City Hall it moved into the old city gymnasium in 1971.\n\nIn later years, the museum became an appropriated line item through the State of Utah.  In 1990-91, the appropriation for the museum was greatly increased because of the tremendous expansion of the museum. A new addition was opened, later to become the Hall of Dinosaurs. Through these two separate expansions during its 45-year history, the museum has become a {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility with another {{convert|6000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} repository and paleontology preparation laboratory.\n\nAn ongoing program of paleontology fieldwork and excavation begun in 1990 has produced 12 new species of dinosaurs and over 7,000 paleontologic specimens.  Federal and state accreditation followed in 1991, allowing the museum to reposit collections from across Utah.  Renewed interest in dinosaurs and a popular culture boom brought thousands more visitors down the [[Dinosaur Diamond Scenic Byway]] and to the museum in the 1990s.\n\nNew development in Utah and the renaissance in dinosaur research has resulted in new finds and an increased level of interest in the museum.

As a state and federal repository for both paleontological and archaeological collections, the museum's holdings include more than 700,000 archaeological artifacts, comprising one of the largest and most significant collections in the country.

The presence of shell middens and refuse heaps at the site will afford an opportunity to study subsistence patterns as well as possibly some information on the paleo-environment.

It is known as the ''Centro Ceremonial Ind\u00edgena de Tibes''.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nThe Centro Ceremonial Indigena at Tibes, Ponce, Puerto Rico, was discovered during the days after heavy rain downpours. The survey was conducted by the Sociedad Guaynia de Arqueologia e Historia and was sponsored by the Puerto Rico [[Institute of Puerto Rican Culture|Institute of Culture]]. Clearing the area's high brush revealed a number of shell middens, as well as the major features of the site which were the carefully laid out stone constructions traditionally referred to as ball courts.<ref name=\"Juan Gonzalez-Colon 1978. Page 2\"/>\n\nA total of seven ball courts and a quadrangular plaza are distributed throughout the site. Five of the ball courts are rectangular, consisting of two parallel lines of flat stones and open at both ends. The remaining two ball courts are U-shaped, bounded on each side by a walk paved with flat river [[cobbles]] and [[boulder]]s. Another major feature of the site is a series of triangular stone arrangements surrounding a flat excavated area.<ref name=\"Juan Gonzalez-Colon 1978. Page 2\"/>\n\nThe main feature of the site is the nearly quadrangular enclosure which has been called a plaza. It is bounded on two sides by a walk paved with flat stones while the other two sides are defined with flat slabs. Many of the stones surrounding the plaza bear [[petroglyph]]s. The terrain within the ball courts and plaza have been artificially modified. Several shell middens are scattered irregularly throughout the site and is some instances the ball courts intrude into them, indicating that the site was occupied for an extended period of time with a gradual evolution into a ceremonial center.<ref name=\"Juan Gonzalez-Colon 1978. Page 2\"/>\n\nA number of test pits have been excavated to establish an absolute and relative chronology as well as to define the potential for the site. These indicate that the site was originally occupied by the earliest agricultural immigrants into the [[greater Antilles]], the Igneri. [[Radiocarbon]] dates and pottery analyses have revealed a continuous period of occupation between 400 A.D. and 1000 A.D. The last inhabitants of the site were presumably the Ta\u00ednos.<ref name=\"Juan Gonzalez-Colon 1978. Page 2\"/>\n\n==Pre-Columbian era==\nThe Ta\u00ednos who inhabited Puerto Rico before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, played a series of games which were both ceremonial and recreational, such as races, contests involving body strength and fishing. However, the two most important of these sports were the simulated warrior fights (similar to the [[gladiator]]s) and ball playing.<ref name=\"TICC\">[http://ponce.inter.edu/tibes/ingles/historia.html ''Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center.''] Luis \u00c1. Rodr\u00edguez Gracia. Accessed 5 May 2018.</ref>\n\n===Body strength games===\nAccording to the eyewitness account of Spanish historian Pedro Martir de Angleria, the body strength games were played in front of the whole village in the presence of the \"Cacique\" (Chief) and in some occasions an invited guest. Two teams would fight with bows and arrows in defense of their possessions as if they were enemies. In one of the events, witnessed by Angleria, four men died and many others were injured in the space of one hour. The contest would come to an end only if the Cacique gave the ending signal.<ref name=\"TICC\"/>\n\n===Ball games===\n[[Image:Tibes.JPG|thumb|150px|left|View of the Indigenous ballparks at Centro Ceremonial Ind\u00edgena de Tibes]]\nThe ball game, called \"Batey\", was played in the ceremonial ball court, which they also called a \"[[Batey (game)|Batey]]\", situated in the middle of the village. The fields were either shaped like a triangle or like a \"U\". The ball was called Batu and made of rubber and vegetable leaves, which gave it flexibility. Two teams played against each other. One team to the west and the other to the east. The fathers and sons played on the opposite teams. The objective of the game was to keep the ball in constant motion. The players were allowed to use their heads, elbows, shoulders and knees. The team would lose a point, if for any reason the ball stopped moving. The score was kept with a mark on the ground and the game would end after the losing team received a certain number of points. The winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed.<ref>[http://stjohnbeachguide.com/Taino%20Ball%20Game.htm The Origin of Ball Games] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221054607/http://stjohnbeachguide.com/Taino%20Ball%20Game.htm |date=21 December 2010 }}</ref> The game had changed by the time the first Spanish settlers arrived. According to Fray [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] the game was played in the following manner: \"One team served the ball and the other team returned it, using anything but the hands. If the ball arrived at shoulder height, it was returned like lightning. When it came in near the ground, the player rapidly hit the ground, striking the ball with his buttocks. Play continued from side to side until an error was made.<ref name=\"GTPR\">[http://www.gotopuertorico.com/go_cultureHistory.php?language=espanol&page=53 ''Cultura e Historia (Culture and History).''] GotoPuertoRico.com. Accessed 5 May 2018.</ref>\n\n==Discovery==\nThe site was discovered in 1975 in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Eloise]].<ref name=Millan /> In that year, [[archaeologist]]s from the Guaynia Society of Archaeology and History at the [[Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Puerto Rico]], members of the Archaeological Society of the Southwest, announced the discovery of the ruins of a \"Batey\" in [[barrio]] [[Tibes]], on the northern outskirts of the city of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]]. A total of 9 ball fields were discovered buried under thick forest overgrowth, dating back to [[Anno Domini|AD]] 25 in the area which is now known as \"Centro Ceremonial Indigena de Tibes\" (The Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center). The fields varied in size from 12.8 meters (42&nbsp;ft) long by 10.9 meters (35.8&nbsp;ft) wide to 35.1 meters (115&nbsp;ft) long by 9.3 meters (30.5&nbsp;ft) wide.<ref name=\"TICC\"/><ref name=\"GTPR\"/>\n\n==Early inhabitants==\n[[File:Areyto ceremony of the Ta\u00edno.jpg|thumb|An Areyto Ceremony]]\nAccording to archeologists, the ball parks and ceremonial centers were built by the Igneri Culture, a Pre-Ta\u00edno tribe which inhabited the island. Modern technology tells us that the area was populated in 25 AD and that the Igneri abandoned the area in 600 AD for some unknown reason or reasons. The Ta\u00ednos populated the same area in 1000 AD.<ref name=\"TICC\"/>\n\nAccording to archaeologist Osvaldo Garcia Goyco, there is evidence that some of the plazas are oriented in relation to the equinox and solstices of the four seasons of the year. This is not unusual since the Ta\u00ednos cultivated their crops in accordance to their astrological observations. The Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center is the oldest astronomical observatory in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"TICC\"/><ref name=\"GTPR\"/>\n\n===Areyto===\nThe Ta\u00ednos had their own culture, customs and governing structure. Besides using the fields for ball playing, they would also use the plazas to celebrate the \"''Areyto''\" which was a celebration consisting of telling an oral history told by singing and dancing accompanied by music. Most of the knowledge and information that we have about the traditions of the Ta\u00ednos came about the personal observations and historical documentations of Fray Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas. Fray Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas described an \"Areyto\" in the following manner: \"And on this island what I could understand was that their songs which they call \"areytos\", were their history passed from person to person, fathers to sons from the present to the future, as here uniting many Indians... passing three or four hours or more until the teacher or guide of the dance finished the history, and sometimes they went from one day to the next.\"<ref name=\"TICC\"/>\n\n==Arrival of the Spaniards==\nWhen the Spaniards arrived in the island one of their first actions was to forcibly convert the Ta\u00ednos into Christianity. They considered the ceremonial and religious practices of the Ta\u00ednos as uncivilized and a form of [[paganism]]. The Ta\u00ednos were enslaved and forced to build fortifications and to work the mines. Many died because of this harsh treatment, and also because of the introduction to diseases such as [[smallpox]] to the island by the Spaniards. However, before the Ta\u00edno tribes ceased to exist in Puerto Rico, Spanish historians such as Fray Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, were able to witness and record the life and customs of these people.<ref name=\"TICC\"/>\n\n==Ongoing work==\nThe continued restoration of Tibes by archaeologists is not an easy one. The following are some factors that are taken into consideration:<ref>[http://www.puertoricodaytrips.com/tibes/ ''Tibes.''] Puerto RicoDailyTrips.com 2018. Accessed 20 May 2018.</ref><ref name=\"Carmelo Rosario Natal 2002. p. 141\"/>\n* Previous archaeological work has been very limited, despite the uncovering and \"restoration\" of many of the stone alignments.\n* Much of the site has yet to be explored and a number of other stone alignments are known to exist outside the mowed area.\n* Except in the burial area, previous excavations have been confined to test pits rather than more extensive, areal exposures.\n* Previous work has been largely on the bateys rather than the spaces between where ethnohistoric sources suggest houses may have stood. Careful excavation in these places may reveal post holes and hut foundations, as well as refuse disposal areas.\n* The pottery at the site spans nearly the entire ceramic history of Puerto Rico and it would be surprising not to find some evidence of Archaic peoples at Tibes also. No other similar site has such a long sequence of material.\n* An accurate and detailed topographic map may reveal other features that suggest artificial terracing.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico/Did you know-Puerto Rico?}}\n*[[List of museums in Ponce, Puerto Rico]]\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Ponce, Puerto Rico]]\n*[[List of archaeological sites sorted by country]]\n*[[Ta\u00ednos]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gotopuertorico.com/go_cultureHistory.php?language=espanol&page=53 Cultura e Historia (Culture and History)]\n*[http://www.prfrogui.com/home/indigena.htm Parque Ceremonial Caguana (Caguana Ceremonial Park)]\n*{{NRHP url|78003381|title=National Register of Historic Places photographic file|photos=y}}\n*[http://ponce.inter.edu/tibes/ingles/conozca.html ''Conozca.'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120805065900/http://puertoricoserver.net/REVISTAHOLAPR1/TIBESII.html ''Tibes, centro activo de investigaci\u00f3n.'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120805065712/http://puertoricoserver.net/REVISTAHOLAPR/TIBES.html ''Centro Ceremon\u00edal Ind\u00edgena de Tibes.'']\n\n{{Ponce, Puerto Rico}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1978 in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Archaeological museums in the United States]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Cultural history of Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Igneri]]\n[[Category:Museums established in 1982]]\n[[Category:Museums in Ponce, Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ponce, Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Native American museums in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Natural history museums in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Ta\u00edno]]\n[[Category:1982 establishments in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Cemeteries in Ponce, Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Archaeological museums]]\n[[Category:Open-air museums]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Ponce, Puerto Rico]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Archeology museum in Ponce, Puerto Rico}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\n{{Infobox museum\n|name          = Centro Ceremonial Ind\u00edgena de Tibes\n|image         = Taino Village.JPG\n|caption       = Ta\u00edno village at Tibes\n|imagesize     = \n|established   = 30 April 1982<ref name=\"Carmelo Rosario Natal 2002. p. 141\">Carmelo Rosario Natal.

It is known as the ''Centro Ceremonial Ind\u00edgena de Tibes''.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nThe Centro Ceremonial Indigena at Tibes, Ponce, Puerto Rico, was discovered during the days after heavy rain downpours. The survey was conducted by the Sociedad Guaynia de Arqueologia e Historia and was sponsored by the Puerto Rico [[Institute of Puerto Rican Culture|Institute of Culture]]. Clearing the area's high brush revealed a number of shell middens, as well as the major features of the site which were the carefully laid out stone constructions traditionally referred to as ball courts.<ref name=\"Juan Gonzalez-Colon 1978. Page 2\"/>\n\nA total of seven ball courts and a quadrangular plaza are distributed throughout the site. Five of the ball courts are rectangular, consisting of two parallel lines of flat stones and open at both ends. The remaining two ball courts are U-shaped, bounded on each side by a walk paved with flat river [[cobbles]] and [[boulder]]s. Another major feature of the site is a series of triangular stone arrangements surrounding a flat excavated area.<ref name=\"Juan Gonzalez-Colon 1978. Page 2\"/>\n\nThe main feature of the site is the nearly quadrangular enclosure which has been called a plaza. It is bounded on two sides by a walk paved with flat stones while the other two sides are defined with flat slabs. Many of the stones surrounding the plaza bear [[petroglyph]]s. The terrain within the ball courts and plaza have been artificially modified. Several shell middens are scattered irregularly throughout the site and is some instances the ball courts intrude into them, indicating that the site was occupied for an extended period of time with a gradual evolution into a ceremonial center.<ref name=\"Juan Gonzalez-Colon 1978. Page 2\"/>\n\nA number of test pits have been excavated to establish an absolute and relative chronology as well as to define the potential for the site. These indicate that the site was originally occupied by the earliest agricultural immigrants into the [[greater Antilles]], the Igneri. [[Radiocarbon]] dates and pottery analyses have revealed a continuous period of occupation between 400 A.D. and 1000 A.D. The last inhabitants of the site were presumably the Ta\u00ednos.<ref name=\"Juan Gonzalez-Colon 1978. Page 2\"/>\n\n==Pre-Columbian era==\nThe Ta\u00ednos who inhabited Puerto Rico before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, played a series of games which were both ceremonial and recreational, such as races, contests involving body strength and fishing. However, the two most important of these sports were the simulated warrior fights (similar to the [[gladiator]]s) and ball playing.<ref name=\"TICC\">[http://ponce.inter.edu/tibes/ingles/historia.html ''Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center.''] Luis \u00c1. Rodr\u00edguez Gracia. Accessed 5 May 2018.</ref>\n\n===Body strength games===\nAccording to the eyewitness account of Spanish historian Pedro Martir de Angleria, the body strength games were played in front of the whole village in the presence of the \"Cacique\" (Chief) and in some occasions an invited guest. Two teams would fight with bows and arrows in defense of their possessions as if they were enemies. In one of the events, witnessed by Angleria, four men died and many others were injured in the space of one hour. The contest would come to an end only if the Cacique gave the ending signal.<ref name=\"TICC\"/>\n\n===Ball games===\n[[Image:Tibes.JPG|thumb|150px|left|View of the Indigenous ballparks at Centro Ceremonial Ind\u00edgena de Tibes]]\nThe ball game, called \"Batey\", was played in the ceremonial ball court, which they also called a \"[[Batey (game)|Batey]]\", situated in the middle of the village. The fields were either shaped like a triangle or like a \"U\". The ball was called Batu and made of rubber and vegetable leaves, which gave it flexibility. Two teams played against each other. One team to the west and the other to the east. The fathers and sons played on the opposite teams. The objective of the game was to keep the ball in constant motion. The players were allowed to use their heads, elbows, shoulders and knees. The team would lose a point, if for any reason the ball stopped moving. The score was kept with a mark on the ground and the game would end after the losing team received a certain number of points. The winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed.<ref>[http://stjohnbeachguide.com/Taino%20Ball%20Game.htm The Origin of Ball Games] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221054607/http://stjohnbeachguide.com/Taino%20Ball%20Game.htm |date=21 December 2010 }}</ref> The game had changed by the time the first Spanish settlers arrived. According to Fray [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] the game was played in the following manner: \"One team served the ball and the other team returned it, using anything but the hands. If the ball arrived at shoulder height, it was returned like lightning. When it came in near the ground, the player rapidly hit the ground, striking the ball with his buttocks. Play continued from side to side until an error was made.<ref name=\"GTPR\">[http://www.gotopuertorico.com/go_cultureHistory.php?language=espanol&page=53 ''Cultura e Historia (Culture and History).''] GotoPuertoRico.com. Accessed 5 May 2018.</ref>\n\n==Discovery==\nThe site was discovered in 1975 in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Eloise]].<ref name=Millan /> In that year, [[archaeologist]]s from the Guaynia Society of Archaeology and History at the [[Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Puerto Rico]], members of the Archaeological Society of the Southwest, announced the discovery of the ruins of a \"Batey\" in [[barrio]] [[Tibes]], on the northern outskirts of the city of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]]. A total of 9 ball fields were discovered buried under thick forest overgrowth, dating back to [[Anno Domini|AD]] 25 in the area which is now known as \"Centro Ceremonial Indigena de Tibes\" (The Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center). The fields varied in size from 12.8 meters (42&nbsp;ft) long by 10.9 meters (35.8&nbsp;ft) wide to 35.1 meters (115&nbsp;ft) long by 9.3 meters (30.5&nbsp;ft) wide.<ref name=\"TICC\"/><ref name=\"GTPR\"/>\n\n==Early inhabitants==\n[[File:Areyto ceremony of the Ta\u00edno.jpg|thumb|An Areyto Ceremony]]\nAccording to archeologists, the ball parks and ceremonial centers were built by the Igneri Culture, a Pre-Ta\u00edno tribe which inhabited the island. Modern technology tells us that the area was populated in 25 AD and that the Igneri abandoned the area in 600 AD for some unknown reason or reasons. The Ta\u00ednos populated the same area in 1000 AD.<ref name=\"TICC\"/>\n\nAccording to archaeologist Osvaldo Garcia Goyco, there is evidence that some of the plazas are oriented in relation to the equinox and solstices of the four seasons of the year. This is not unusual since the Ta\u00ednos cultivated their crops in accordance to their astrological observations. The Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center is the oldest astronomical observatory in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"TICC\"/><ref name=\"GTPR\"/>\n\n===Areyto===\nThe Ta\u00ednos had their own culture, customs and governing structure. Besides using the fields for ball playing, they would also use the plazas to celebrate the \"''Areyto''\" which was a celebration consisting of telling an oral history told by singing and dancing accompanied by music. Most of the knowledge and information that we have about the traditions of the Ta\u00ednos came about the personal observations and historical documentations of Fray Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas. Fray Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas described an \"Areyto\" in the following manner: \"And on this island what I could understand was that their songs which they call \"areytos\", were their history passed from person to person, fathers to sons from the present to the future, as here uniting many Indians... passing three or four hours or more until the teacher or guide of the dance finished the history, and sometimes they went from one day to the next.\"<ref name=\"TICC\"/>\n\n==Arrival of the Spaniards==\nWhen the Spaniards arrived in the island one of their first actions was to forcibly convert the Ta\u00ednos into Christianity. They considered the ceremonial and religious practices of the Ta\u00ednos as uncivilized and a form of [[paganism]]. The Ta\u00ednos were enslaved and forced to build fortifications and to work the mines. Many died because of this harsh treatment, and also because of the introduction to diseases such as [[smallpox]] to the island by the Spaniards. However, before the Ta\u00edno tribes ceased to exist in Puerto Rico, Spanish historians such as Fray Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, were able to witness and record the life and customs of these people.<ref name=\"TICC\"/>\n\n==Ongoing work==\nThe continued restoration of Tibes by archaeologists is not an easy one. The following are some factors that are taken into consideration:<ref>[http://www.puertoricodaytrips.com/tibes/ ''Tibes.''] Puerto RicoDailyTrips.com 2018. Accessed 20 May 2018.</ref><ref name=\"Carmelo Rosario Natal 2002. p. 141\"/>\n* Previous archaeological work has been very limited, despite the uncovering and \"restoration\" of many of the stone alignments.\n* Much of the site has yet to be explored and a number of other stone alignments are known to exist outside the mowed area.\n* Except in the burial area, previous excavations have been confined to test pits rather than more extensive, areal exposures.\n* Previous work has been largely on the bateys rather than the spaces between where ethnohistoric sources suggest houses may have stood. Careful excavation in these places may reveal post holes and hut foundations, as well as refuse disposal areas.\n* The pottery at the site spans nearly the entire ceramic history of Puerto Rico and it would be surprising not to find some evidence of Archaic peoples at Tibes also. No other similar site has such a long sequence of material.\n* An accurate and detailed topographic map may reveal other features that suggest artificial terracing.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico/Did you know-Puerto Rico?}}\n*[[List of museums in Ponce, Puerto Rico]]\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Ponce, Puerto Rico]]\n*[[List of archaeological sites sorted by country]]\n*[[Ta\u00ednos]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gotopuertorico.com/go_cultureHistory.php?language=espanol&page=53 Cultura e Historia (Culture and History)]\n*[http://www.prfrogui.com/home/indigena.htm Parque Ceremonial Caguana (Caguana Ceremonial Park)]\n*{{NRHP url|78003381|title=National Register of Historic Places photographic file|photos=y}}\n*[http://ponce.inter.edu/tibes/ingles/conozca.html ''Conozca.'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120805065900/http://puertoricoserver.net/REVISTAHOLAPR1/TIBESII.html ''Tibes, centro activo de investigaci\u00f3n.'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120805065712/http://puertoricoserver.net/REVISTAHOLAPR/TIBES.html ''Centro Ceremon\u00edal Ind\u00edgena de Tibes.'']\n\n{{Ponce, Puerto Rico}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places}}\n\n[[Category:1978 in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Archaeological museums in the United States]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Cultural history of Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Igneri]]\n[[Category:Museums established in 1982]]\n[[Category:Museums in Ponce, Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ponce, Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Native American museums in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Natural history museums in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Ta\u00edno]]\n[[Category:1982 establishments in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Cemeteries in Ponce, Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Archaeological museums]]\n[[Category:Open-air museums]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Ponce, Puerto Rico]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibes_Indigenous_Ceremonial_Center"}
