There had been other camps known as jungles in previous years, but this particular [[shanty town]] drew global media attention during the peak of the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015, when its population grew rapidly. Migrants stayed at the camp while they attempted to enter the [[United Kingdom]], or while they awaited their [[Asylum in France|French asylum claims]] to be processed.\n\nThe camp was located on a former [[landfill]] site to the east of Calais. By July 2015, it had 3,000 inhabitants and continued to grow. Although estimates of the number of migrants differed, a [[Help Refugees]] [[census]] gave a figure of 8,143 people just before the camp's demolition in October 2016. As well as residences, the Jungle contained shops, restaurants, hairdressers, schools, places of worship and a boxing club. \n\nThe [[Government of France]] initially tolerated the camp, later opting to rehouse 1,500 migrants in shipping containers to be used as shelters on the north-eastern side of the site. In February 2016, they evicted the southern sector of the Jungle and there were several arrests. The Jungle received local support and international solidarity from activists, artists, intellectuals and [[grassroots]] [[Aid agency|aid organisations]]. The camp was completely cleared and demolished in October 2016. According to Government plans, 6,400 migrants would be moved to 280 temporary reception centres around France. There were concerns over the fate of 200 [[Unaccompanied minor|unaccompanied children]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] published a report in 2017 stating that up to 1,000 migrants were still living in the Calais region.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Calais2015g.jpg|thumb|Badeldin Shogar, a Sudanese migrant, at the Jungle in October 2015]]\n{{see also|Migrants around Calais}}\n{{see also|Timeline of the European migrant crisis}}\n\nMigrants [[migrants around Calais|based in Calais]] were attempting to enter the United Kingdom via the [[Port of Calais]] or the [[Channel Tunnel]] by [[stowing away]] on lorries, ferries, cars, or trains.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21660581-camp-channels-edge-sideshow-europes-migrant-crisis-it-offers-important|title=Learning from the Jungle|work=The Economist|date=8 August 2015|accessdate=28 December 2015|url-access=subscription|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714000401/https://www.economist.com/europe/2015/08/06/learning-from-the-jungle |archive-date=6 August 2015}}</ref> Some migrants were attempting to return to the United Kingdom having once lived there,<ref name=\"Avoid\" /> whilst others were attempting to enter the British labour market to [[Unreported employment|work illegally]] rather than claim asylum in France.<ref name=\"bbc2\" /><ref name=\"guard3Sept\" /> Some migrants lived in the camp while seeking asylum in France, a choice they made because the French system did not provide for them while their claim was being processed, leaving them [[Homelessness in France|homeless]] for the duration.<ref>Francesca Ansaloni, 'Deterritorialising the Jungle: Understanding the Calais camp through its orderings' in ''Environment and Planning C: Politics and Space'' (25/02/20) doi.org/10.1177/2399654420908597</ref> One migrant from [[Egypt]], a politics graduate, told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that he had \"paid $3,000 (\u00a32,000) to leave Egypt, risked my life on a boat to Italy spending days at sea\" and that in one month he had tried 20 times to reach England; another, an [[Eritrea]]n woman with a one-year-old child, had paid \u20ac2,500 (\u00a31,825) \u2013 and her husband the same \u2013 to sail to [[Italy]], but her husband had [[European migrant crisis#Deaths and incidents|drowned during the journey]].<ref name=\"horror\">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/06/at-night-its-like-a-horror-movie-inside-calaiss-official-shanty-town 'At night it's like a horror movie'&nbsp;\u2013 inside Calais's official shantytown.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629210030/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/06/at-night-its-like-a-horror-movie-inside-calaiss-official-shanty-town |date=29 June 2016 }} Angelique Chrisafis, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 April 2015.

[[France]] that existed from January 2015 to October 2016. There had been other camps known as jungles in previous years, but this particular [[shanty town]] drew global media attention during the peak of the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015, when its population grew rapidly. Migrants stayed at the camp while they attempted to enter the [[United Kingdom]], or while they awaited their [[Asylum in France|French asylum claims]] to be processed.\n\nThe camp was located on a former [[landfill]] site to the east of Calais. By July 2015, it had 3,000 inhabitants and continued to grow. Although estimates of the number of migrants differed, a [[Help Refugees]] [[census]] gave a figure of 8,143 people just before the camp's demolition in October 2016. As well as residences, the Jungle contained shops, restaurants, hairdressers, schools, places of worship and a boxing club. \n\nThe [[Government of France]] initially tolerated the camp, later opting to rehouse 1,500 migrants in shipping containers to be used as shelters on the north-eastern side of the site. In February 2016, they evicted the southern sector of the Jungle and there were several arrests.

Landscaping includes a large koi pond with artificial stream, a small citrus orchard and two well-established forests of tree ferns and redwoods. The west wing (originally servant's wing) houses the Editorial offices of Playboy. The main Aviary building is the original greenhouse, with four guestrooms adjoining. The Master suite occupies several rooms on the second and third floors, and is the most heavily renovated area of the Mansion proper, with an extensive carved-oak decor dating to the 1970s. Otherwise, the Mansion proper is maintained in its original Gothic-revival furnishings for the most part. The pipe organ was extensively restored in the last decade.{{when|date=September 2017}} There is also an outdoor kitchen to serve party events. These features and others have been shown on television.\n\nThe game room (game house) is a separate building on the north side. From the fountain in front of the main entrance, there are two sidewalks, running past a wishing-well. That on the right leads to the game house and runs past a duplicate Hollywood Star of Hefner. Its front entrance opens to a game room with a pool table in the center. This room has vintage and modern [[arcade game]]s, [[pinball machine]]s, [[player piano]], [[jukebox]], television, stereo, and couch. The game house has two wings. Left is a room with a soft cushioned floor, mirrors all around, television. There is a restroom with a shower. The right wing of the game house has a smaller restroom, and entrance to a bedroom. This bedroom is connected to another, which has an exit to the rear backyard of the game house. The game house has a backyard with lounge chairs, and gates on either side.\n\nIn 2010, Hugh Hefner's former girlfriend Izabella St. James wrote in her memoir ''Bunny Tales'' that the house was in need of renovation: \"Everything in the Mansion felt old and stale, and Archie the house dog would regularly relieve himself on the hallway curtains, adding a powerful whiff of urine to the general scent of decay\"<ref>[http://www.shelterpop.com/2011/03/17/izabella-st-james-playboy-mansion/?icid=main%7Chtmlws-sb-w%7Cdl12%7Csec1_lnk3%7C206870 Article] at Shelterpop.com</ref> and that \"Each bedroom had mismatched, random pieces of furniture. It was as if someone had gone to a charity shop and bought the basics for each room\"; and, \"The mattresses on our beds were disgusting \u2013 old, worn and stained. The sheets were past their best, too.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.realtytoday.com/articles/44772/20151021/celebrity-homes-inside-the-crumbling-sorry-state-of-playboy-mansion.htm | title=Celebrity Homes: Inside the Crumbling, Sorry State of the Playboy Mansion| date=October 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe mansion next door is a [[mirror image]] of the Playboy Mansion layout, only smaller, and was purchased by Hefner in 1996 as the home for his separated wife [[Kimberley Conrad]] and their children together, Marston and Cooper. Hefner and Conrad married in 1989 and separated in 1998.

Landscaping includes a large koi pond with artificial stream, a small citrus orchard and two well-established forests of tree ferns and redwoods. The west wing (originally servant's wing) houses the Editorial offices of Playboy. The main Aviary building is the original greenhouse, with four guestrooms adjoining. The Master suite occupies several rooms on the second and third floors, and is the most heavily renovated area of the Mansion proper, with an extensive carved-oak decor dating to the 1970s.

The original [[leper colony]] was first established in [[Kalawao]] in the east, opposite to the village corner of the peninsula. It was there where [[Father Damien]] settled in 1873. Later it was moved to the location of the current village, which was originally a Hawaiian fishing village. The settlement was also attended by [[Mother Marianne Cope]] and physician [[Arthur Albert St. Mouritz]], among others. Between 1893-1894, the Board of Health made an effort to remove the last non-patient Native Hawaiian inhabitants in order to expand the settlement to encompass the entire Kalaupapa peninsula, including Kalawao.<ref name=\":0\" /> At its peak, about 1,200 men, women, and children were exiled to Kalaupapa Peninsula.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bowman|first=Sally-Jo|date=Dec 1995|title=Remembering the time of separation|url=|journal=National Parks|volume=69|pages=30|via=EBSCO Host}}</ref> The isolation law was enacted by [[Kamehameha V|King Kamehameha V]] and remained in effect until its repeal in 1969.

Intervention by interested persons, such as entertainer [[Don Ho]] and TV newsman Don Picken, resulted in allowing the residents who chose to do so to remain there for life. The opponents to closure pointed out that, although there were no active cases of leprosy in the colony, many of the residents were physically scarred by the disease to an extent that would make their integration into mainstream society difficult if not impossible.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Offshore of Kalaupapa.jpg|thumb|The offshore islands `\u014dkala, M\u014dkapu, and Huelo as seen from Kalaupapa]]\nThe Kalaupapa Peninsula remains one of the most remote locations in Hawaii due to unique volcanic and geologic activity over millions of years.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/kala/planyourvisit/upload/geologyofkala.pdf|title=Geography of Kalaupapa|last=National Park Service U.

A complete Yuga cycle consists of ''[[Satya Yuga]]'', ''[[Treta Yuga]],'' ''[[Dvapara Yuga]], and'' ''[[Kali Yuga]]''. Traditionally, Kali Yuga is followed by Satya Yuga at the start of each cycle (S,T,D,K) (S,T,D,K). Some modern scholars believe in shorter descending and ascending Yugas within each cycle (S,T,D,K,K,D,T,S) (S,T,D,K,K,D,T,S). \n\nAccording to the epic [[Mahabharata]], the current age is Kali Yuga and it started in the year 3102 BCE after lord [[Krishna]] left this world. One can also compare the current age with the characteristics described for each yuga and see that Kali Yuga is the best match. \n\nSome scholars say that our present time is ascending Kali Yuga,<ref>{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=BBwLVlOipyUC&pg=PA15&dq=four+yugas#v=onepage&q=four%20yugas&f=false| title=The Path to Immortality|page=15|first1= Mark L.|last1=Prophet|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Clare Prophet|author2-link=Elizabeth Clare Prophet|publisher= Summit University Press| isbn=9781932890099| year=2006}}</ref> while some other scholars say that Kali Yuga ended in 1700 CE and now we're in ascending Dwapara Yuga.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Holy Science|last=Swami|first=Sri Yukeshwar Giri|publisher=Yogoda Satsang Society|year=1949|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics of the four Yugas ==\nThere are four Yugas in one cycle:\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' (or Krita Yuga)\n* ''[[Treta Yuga]]''\n* ''[[Dwapara Yuga]]''\n* ''[[Kali Yuga]]''\n\n=== Characteristics of each Yuga ===\n\n* '''Satya Yuga''' (\"The age of truth\" or \"[[Golden Age#Hindu|Golden Age]]\"): The first and best yuga. It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.\n\n* '''Kal Yuga''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following [[Dharma]] and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished. Families become non-existent.

It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.\n\n* '''Kal Yuga''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following [[Dharma]] and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished. Families become non-existent.

The station was used by scheduled passenger trains between 1838 and 1854 when it was the [[terminal station|terminus]] for both the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] and the [[Grand Junction Railway]], with lines to [[London]], [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]] respectively. Excursion trains ran until 1893 after which only goods trains operated until closure in 1966. More recently, the surviving [[Grade I listed]] entrance building was used for occasional art events.\n\nIn 2010, a [[Birmingham Curzon Street railway station|new station]], partly on the site of the historical Curzon Street station, was proposed as the Birmingham terminus for [[High Speed 2]]. In 2017 plans were approved to redevelop the remaining Grade 1 listed building to turn it into a visitor centre and office space for HS2 and other organisations. HS2 hopes to use the station as the hub for its high-speed line linking London and Birmingham \u2013 although these plans are still being developed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-40524039|title=HS2 Victorian station plans approved|date=2017-07-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe station, originally known as 'Birmingham' station was opened on 24 June 1838, with the first train from [[London]] to Birmingham arriving on 17 September. It was the terminus for both the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] and the [[Grand Junction Railway]] and the companies had adjacent, parallel platforms but there were no through trains.\n[[File:Curzonplatforms.jpg|thumb|left|1838 drawing of the rear of the station's platforms while in operation.]]\nThe Grand Junction Railway arrived at Curzon Street in 1839. Although the line had opened in 1837, one year before the London and Birmingham Railway, it originally ran to a temporary terminus at [[Duddeston railway station|Vauxhall]]. A viaduct had to be constructed to allow the line to reach Curzon Street.<ref>Osborne, E.C.; W. Osborne (1838). Osborne's guide to the Grand Junction, or Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester Railway. pp. 101\u20132.</ref> The smaller [[Lawley Street railway station|Lawley Street station]], terminus of the [[Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway]] (a forerunner of the [[Midland Railway]]) was later opened a short distance to the east.\n\nThe original intention was for the GJR and the LBR to have an end-on junction at Curzon Street, with the GJR arriving from Perry Barr through a tunnel under Gosta Green aligning with the tracks into the goods station which was built on the other side of Curzon Street and accessed via a level crossing.\u00a0 In the event, inter alia saving trouble and expense in terms of tunnelling and acquiring property in the town centre, the plans were changed and the GJR arrived from Perry Barr via Vauxhall.\u00a0 As it was the LBR had already built its station at Curzon Street so the GJR had to construct its own.\u00a0 This meant that Curzon Street was effectively two stations in one.\n\nBehind the hotel building, the L&B station had a [[wrought iron]] framed [[trainshed|train-shed]] which had two spans, and covered an area 217 feet (66 metres) long and 113 feet (34 metres) wide.

The station was used by scheduled passenger trains between 1838 and 1854 when it was the [[terminal station|terminus]] for both the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] and the [[Grand Junction Railway]], with lines to [[London]], [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]] respectively. Excursion trains ran until 1893 after which only goods trains operated until closure in 1966. More recently, the surviving [[Grade I listed]] entrance building was used for occasional art events.\n\nIn 2010, a [[Birmingham Curzon Street railway station|new station]], partly on the site of the historical Curzon Street station, was proposed as the Birmingham terminus for [[High Speed 2]]. In 2017 plans were approved to redevelop the remaining Grade 1 listed building to turn it into a visitor centre and office space for HS2 and other organisations. HS2 hopes to use the station as the hub for its high-speed line linking London and Birmingham \u2013 although these plans are still being developed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-40524039|title=HS2 Victorian station plans approved|date=2017-07-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe station, originally known as 'Birmingham' station was opened on 24 June 1838, with the first train from [[London]] to Birmingham arriving on 17 September. It was the terminus for both the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] and the [[Grand Junction Railway]] and the companies had adjacent, parallel platforms but there were no through trains.\n[[File:Curzonplatforms.jpg|thumb|left|1838 drawing of the rear of the station's platforms while in operation.]]\nThe Grand Junction Railway arrived at Curzon Street in 1839. Although the line had opened in 1837, one year before the London and Birmingham Railway, it originally ran to a temporary terminus at [[Duddeston railway station|Vauxhall]]. A viaduct had to be constructed to allow the line to reach Curzon Street.<ref>Osborne, E.C.; W. Osborne (1838).
