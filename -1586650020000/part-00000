Leaving the village at 11:15, we descended into the southern basin, and then entered a long shallow valley running up on the right of Deir el-Ghusun and its hill. A string of ten camels, led by donkeys, was slowly climbing the hill to that village. At 11:50 we were at the top of the valley; Deir el-Ghusun bearing north 70\u00b0E, half a mile distant. The region is full of olive trees. A valley comes down from the south nearly to the village, and then sweeps round to the west. This we crossed, and then rose upon sloping ground on our left. At 12.05 we came out upon the brow of the deep Valley Mussin, coming from the plain of [[Fendekumieh]]; it is said to unite with Wady Abu Nar in the western plain beyond Jett. We reached the bottom of the valley at 12.20; and noticed its deep water-channel, now dry.\u2014The road thus far from 'Attil was evidently very old; but we saw no appearance of pavement. Whether this was the ancient way from [[Caesarea]] to [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebaste]] may be doubted; since a more feasible route exists from the plain along the great Wady Sha'ir, which comes down from Nabulus, and is the next valley south of Wady Mussin.\"<ref>Robinson and Smith, 1856, p.

Leaving the village at 11:15, we descended into the southern basin, and then entered a long shallow valley running up on the right of Deir el-Ghusun and its hill. A string of ten camels, led by donkeys, was slowly climbing the hill to that village. At 11:50 we were at the top of the valley; Deir el-Ghusun bearing north 70\u00b0E, half a mile distant. The region is full of olive trees. A valley comes down from the south nearly to the village, and then sweeps round to the west. This we crossed, and then rose upon sloping ground on our left. At 12.05 we came out upon the brow of the deep Valley Mussin, coming from the plain of [[Fendekumieh]]; it is said to unite with Wady Abu Nar in the western plain beyond Jett. We reached the bottom of the valley at 12.20; and noticed its deep water-channel, now dry.\u2014The road thus far from 'Attil was evidently very old; but we saw no appearance of pavement. Whether this was the ancient way from [[Caesarea]] to [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebaste]] may be doubted; since a more feasible route exists from the plain along the great Wady Sha'ir, which comes down from Nabulus, and is the next valley south of Wady Mussin.\"<ref>Robinson and Smith, 1856, p.
