This is accidental, as the Cemetery was built parallel to the beach on the lands granted by the French.\n\n===Memorial===\nThe Memorial consists of a semicircular [[colonnade]] with a [[loggia]] at each end containing maps and narratives of the military operations. It is built in medium-hard limestone from upper [[Burgundy]]. Two of the maps, designed by Robert Foster, are 32 feet long and 20 feet high.\n\nAt the center is a 22-foot bronze statue entitled ''The Spirit of American Youth Rising from the Waves'' by [[Donald De Lue]].\n\nOver the arches of the Memorial is engraved ''\u201cTHIS EMBATTLED SHORE, PORTAL OF FREEDOM, IS FOREVER HALLOWED BY THE IDEALS, THE VALOR AND THE SACRIFICES OF OUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN\u201d''.\n\nAt the feet of the Memorial is engraved both in English and French ''\u201cIN PROUD REMEMBRANCE OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF HER SONS AND IN HUMBLE TRIBUTE TO THEIR SACRIFICES THIS MEMORIAL HAS BEEN ERECTED BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\u201d''.\n\n<gallery heights=\"140\" widths=\"200\">\nAmerican cemetery - Omaha.jpg|The Memorial from the other side of the reflecting pool\nFrance-000831 - Spirit of American Youth Rising from the Waves (14880620948).jpg|\"Spirit of American Youth Rising from the Waves\"\nM\u00e9morial Cimeti\u00e8re Colleville-sur-Mer - Statue Centrale.jpg|\"Spirit of American Youth Rising from the Waves\"\nM\u00e9morial Cimeti\u00e8re Colleville-sur-Mer - Carte du D\u00e9barquement en Normandie.jpg|Map of the landings on the Normandy beaches\nM\u00e9morial Cimeti\u00e8re Colleville-sur-Mer - Carte des Op\u00e9rations A\u00e9riennes Mars-Ao\u00fbt 1944.jpg|Map of the air operations over Normandy\nM\u00e9morial Cimeti\u00e8re Colleville-sur-Mer - Carte des Op\u00e9rations Navales.jpg|Map of the amphibious assault landings\nM\u00e9morial Cimeti\u00e8re Colleville-sur-Mer - Carte Op\u00e9rations Alli\u00e9es en Europe 6-6-44 au 8-5-45.jpg|Map of the military operations in Western Europe\n</gallery>\n\n===Wall of the Missing===\nThe semi-circular gardens bear the 1,557 engraved names of service members declared missing in action in Normandy.

Its altar, in black and gold Pyrenean marble, reads ''\u201cI GIVE UNTO THEM ETERNAL LIFE AND THEY SHALL NEVER PERISH\u201d''. The stained glass behind it bears a Latin cross and present a star of David, as well as an alpha and an omega symbol, meant to represent all other religions.\n\nOn its ceiling lies a spectacular mosaic by [[Leon Kroll]].

There, a red-capped [[Marianne]] figure personifying France bestows a laurel wreath upon the same young man. His now lifeless body leans against her as she cradles his head in her lap.

Its undergrowth is composed of Austrian Pines, Alders, Common Oak Trees, American Red Oaks, Holly Oaks, Ash Trees, Sycamore Trees, Maple Trees, and a few Maritime Pines and Pine Trees. It is decorated by Polyantha Rose Trees, Callunas Heaths and Ericas Heaths.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998), the cemetery is featured at the beginning and end, showing World War II veteran Private James Francis Ryan accompanied by his family. In the beginning of the film, he makes his way to the grave of Captain John Miller (played by [[Tom Hanks]]). At the end, Ryan salutes the grave and asks his wife if he lived a good life and was a good man. (Both the grave and Captain John Miller are fictional; the headstone for Miller was only brought to the cemetery for the movie.) The Private Ryan story is based upon the story of the [[Niland Brothers]], two of whom are buried in the cemetery; references are also made to the five [[Sullivan brothers]], who were all killed in the \"''Juneau'' incident\".\n* ''Symphonic Prelude (The Cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer)'', by [[Mark Camphouse]], portrays the battle in a way that battles are commonly depicted for bands: a slow introduction followed by a moderate tempo body and a majestic ending.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of military cemeteries in Normandy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Sledge |first=Michael |title=Soldier Dead: How We Recover, Identify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen |year=2005 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780231509374 |page=|oclc= 60527603 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{div col}}\n* [http://visitnormandy.wordpress.com/d-day-65th-anniversary-events-2009/ ''Complete List of Memorial Events for 65th Anniversary of D-Day'']\n* [http://www.americandday.org ''American D-Day: Omaha Beach, Utah Beach & Pointe du Hoc'']\n* [http://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries-memorials/europe/normandy-american-cemetery World War II Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial], American Battle Monuments Commission\n* [http://fleursdelamemoire.free.fr Organization ''Les Fleurs de la M\u00e9moire'']\n* [http://www.ww1cemeteries.com World War I cemeteries.com a comprehensive guide to the military cemeteries and memorials around the world]\n* [https://www.backtonormandy.org/american-cemetery-normandy.html \"Overview by theme, American Cemetery and Memorial \"]\n* [http://www.backtonormandy.org/the-history/other-interesting-records/american-cemetery-and-memorial.html \"Names of the people buried in the cemetery\"]\n* [http://www.backtonormandy.org/american-cemetery/1325-american-cemetery-and-memorial-normandy-states.html \"Overview of the graves on the American Cemetery and Memorial Normandy by State]\n* [http://www.backtonormandy.org/american-cemetery/1323-american-cemetery-and-memorial-normandy-by-unit.html \"Numbers by unit (example first row: 463 graves of the 262 Infantry Regiment of the 66 Division). \"]\n{{div col end}}\n<!--spacing-->\n{{American Battle Monuments Commission}}\n{{Second World War military cemeteries in Normandy}}\n{{World War I War Memorials in France}}\n{{Battle of Normandy}}\n\n{{Subject bar\n| portal1=Architecture\n| portal2=France\n| portal3=World War II\n| commons=y\n| commons-search=Category:Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Normandy}}\n[[Category:American Battle Monuments Commission]]\n[[Category:Cemeteries in Calvados (department)]]\n[[Category:World War II memorials in France]]\n[[Category:World War II cemeteries in France]]\n[[Category:Military history of Normandy]]\n[[Category:1944 establishments in France]]\n[[Category:Cemeteries in Normandy]]\n\n[[de:Gedenken an die Operation Overlord#Soldatenfriedhof in Colleville-sur-Mer]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Military cemetery in Normandy}}\n{{Infobox Military Cemetery\n|name=Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial\n|body=[[American Battle Monuments Commission]]\n|image=[[File:American military cemetery 2003.JPG|300px]]\n|commemorates=[[Operation Overlord]]\n|use_dates=1942\u20131946\n|unveiled={{start date|1956|07|19}}\n|designer=[[H2L2|Harbeson, Hough, Livingston & Larson]] <br />Markley Stevenson <small>(landscaping)</small> <br />[[Donald De Lue]] <small>(sculptor)</small><br />[[Leon Kroll]] <small>(murals)</small><br />Robert Foster <small>(maps)</small>\n|coordinates={{coord|49.360278|-0.857222|type:landmark_region:FR|display=inline,title}}\n|nearest_town=[[Colleville-sur-Mer]], [[France]]\n|total=9,388\n|unknowns=307\n|commemorated=1,557\n|by_country=\n* [[United States]]: 9,388\n|by_war=\n* [[World War II]]: 9,387\n* [[World War I]]: 1\n|source=[http://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries/cemeteries/no.php American Battle Monuments Commission]\n}}\n\nThe '''Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial''' ({{lang-fr|Cimeti\u00e8re am\u00e9ricain de Colleville-sur-Mer}}) is a [[World War II]] [[cemetery]] and [[memorial]] in [[Colleville-sur-Mer]], [[Normandy]], France, that honors American [[troops]] who died in Europe during World War II.

At the end, Ryan salutes the grave and asks his wife if he lived a good life and was a good man. (Both the grave and Captain John Miller are fictional; the headstone for Miller was only brought to the cemetery for the movie.)

His [[British Whig Party|Whig]] supporting extended [[Darwin\u2013Wedgwood family|family of Darwins and Wedgwoods]] was strongly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], though one of his grandfathers, [[Erasmus Darwin]], was a [[Freethought|freethinker]], and his father was quietly a freethinker but as a physician avoided any social conflict with his wealthy Anglican patrons. While Darwin's parents were open enough to changing social pressures to have Charles [[baptism|baptised]] in the Church of England, his pious mother took the children to the Unitarian chapel. After her death when he was only eight he became a [[boarding school|boarder]] at the ''[[Shrewsbury School]]'', an Anglican [[public school (England)|public school]].<ref name=skool/>\n\n===Edinburgh \u2013 medical studies and Lamarckian evolution theory===\nThe two universities in England namely [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], were under the Church of England and required students to sign the ''[[Thirty-nine Articles]] of the [[Anglican]] faith'', so many English Non-conformists sent their children to the Scottish universities which had a better reputation in fields like medicine.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=22}}</ref> Charles initially attended the [[University of Edinburgh]], and while he was put off medicine he took an active interest in [[natural history]] at the [[Plinian Society]]. One of his proposers for the society was the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] [[William A. F. Browne]], and on 27 March 1827 Browne argued that mind and consciousness were simply aspects of brain activity, not \"souls\" or spiritual entities separate from the body. A furious debate ensued, and later someone struck out all mention of this [[materialism|materialist]] heresy from the minutes. This was the first time that Darwin was exposed to militant [[freethought]] and the arguments it aroused.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=38}}</ref> On one occasion [[Robert Edmund Grant]] discussed [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck's]] [[Lamarckism|evolutionary ideas]]. Darwin was astonished, but had recently read the similar ideas of his grandfather Erasmus and remained indifferent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=72\u201388}}</ref>\n\nNatural history had grown from the idea that the different kinds of plants and animals showed the wonder of God's [[Genesis creation myth|creation]], making their study and cataloguing into species worthwhile. In Darwin's day it was common for clergymen to be naturalists, though scientific findings had already opened up [[history of creationism|ideas on creation]]. The established churches (of England and Scotland) and the English universities remained insistent that species were divinely created and man was distinct from the \"lower orders\", but the Unitarian church rejected this teaching and even proclaimed that the human [[mind]] was subject to physical law. [[Erasmus Darwin]] went further and his ''[[Zo\u00f6nomia]]'' asks \"...would it be too bold to imagine that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which the great First Cause endued with animality.... possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down these improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end!\", anticipating [[Lamarckism]].\n\n===Cambridge \u2013 theology and geology===\nWhen Darwin proved unable to persevere at medical studies, his father sent him to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], for a Bachelor of Arts degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican [[parson]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=47\u201348}}</ref> Darwin was at first uncertain, he later wrote: \"from what little I had heard and thought on the subject I had scruples about declaring my belief in all the dogmas of the Church of England; though otherwise I liked the thought of being a country clergyman. Accordingly I read with care '[[John Pearson (bishop)|Pearson]] [[Exposition of the Creed|on the Creed]]' and a few other books on [[divinity]]; and as I did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself that our [[Creed]] must be fully accepted. It never struck me how illogical it was to say that I believed in what I could not understand and what is in fact unintelligible. I might have said with entire truth that I had no wish to dispute any dogma; but I never was such a fool as to feel and say '[[Credo quia absurdum|credo quia incredibile]]\".<ref name=dar57/> He was particularly convinced by the reasoning of [[John Bird Sumner]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity'' which set out the logic that the unbelief of [[Religious skepticism|sceptics]] gave them the dilemma that if Christianity were untrue, then either \"Jesus did not live, or he actually lived, but was not the Son of God, hence an imposter.\" The Gospels made this highly improbable, as his miracles had convinced unbelievers, hence we had \"no right to deny\" that such events were probable. Jesus's religion was \"wonderfully suitable... to our ideas of happiness in this & the next world\" and there was \"no other way... of explaining the series of evidence & probability.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=48\u201349}}</ref>\n\nThe university was essentially tied into the Church of England, with virtually all of the college heads and most of the professors and fellows having been ordained. About half of the undergraduates were destined for the church, like Darwin hoping for a comfortable parish. During Darwin's second year, the harmony was disturbed when Cambridge was briefly visited by the [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] [[Richard Carlile]] and the Revd [[Robert Taylor (Radical)|Robert Taylor]] on an \"infidel home missionary tour\", causing a stir before being banned. Taylor would be remembered by Darwin as \"the [[Devil]]'s Chaplain\", a warning example of an outcast from society who had challenged Christianity and had been imprisoned for [[blasphemy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=50, 70\u201373}}</ref>\n\nIn his third year, he joined [[John Stevens Henslow]]'s natural history course and was introduced to the Cambridge version of [[natural theology]], part of the [[liberal Christianity]] of colleagues such as [[Adam Sedgwick]], [[George Peacock]] and [[William Whewell]] who all had strong views about science as the search for the laws of nature. Study of nature was study of the work of the Lord, and scientists who were ordained clerics of the Church of England, such as themselves, could follow their enquiries without theological difficulties. Sedgwick gave a talk to the [[Geological Society of London]] in 1831 which declared that \"No opinion can be heretical, but that which is not true.... Conflicting falsehoods we can comprehend; but truths can never war against each other. I affirm, therefore, that we have nothing to fear from the results of our enquiries, provided they be followed in the laborious but secure road of honest induction. In this way we may rest assured that we shall never arrive at conclusions opposed to any truth, either physical or moral, from whatever source that truth may be derived.\" For these men, science could not be out of harmony with religion, and in a sense it was religion.<ref name=browne126>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=126\u2013129}}</ref>\n\nUnder pressure in the fourth year, Darwin worked hard at his studies, getting tuition in theology by Henslow. Darwin became particularly interested in the Revd [[William Paley]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity'' and ''Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy'', which were set texts. The latter was becoming outdated. It opposed arguments for increased democracy, but saw no divine right of rule for the sovereign or the state, only \"expediency\". Government could be opposed if grievances outweighed the danger and expense to society. The judgement was \"Every man for himself\". These ideas had suited the conditions of reasonable rule prevailing when the text was published in 1785, but in 1830 they were dangerous ideas at a time when the French king was deposed by middle class republicans and given refuge in England by the [[Tory]] government, and resulting radical street protests demanded [[suffrage]], [[Social equality|equality]] and [[freedom of religion]]. Paley's text even supported abolition of the ''[[Thirty-nine Articles]]'' of the Anglican faith which every student at Cambridge (and [[Oxford University]]) was required to sign. Henslow insisted that \"he should be grieved if a single word of the Thirty-nine Articles were altered\" and emphasised the need to respect authority. Darwin later wrote that he was convinced that he \"could have written out the whole of the ''Evidences'' with perfect correctness, but not of course in the clear language of Paley. The logic of this book and as I may add of his ''Natural Theology'' gave me as much delight as did [[Euclid]].\"<ref name=\"Darwin 1958\">{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=69 67\u201368].}}</ref>\n\nAfter doing particularly well in his final exam questions on Paleys' books, Darwin read Paley's ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity|Natural Theology]]'' which set out to refute [[David Hume]]'s argument that the [[teleological argument]] for \"design\" by a Creator was merely a human projection onto the forces of nature. Paley saw a rational proof of God's existence in the complexity and perfect [[adaptation]] to needs of living beings exquisitely fitted to their places in a happy world, while attacking the evolutionary ideas of [[Erasmus Darwin]] as coinciding with atheistic schemes and lacking evidence.<ref>{{harvnb|Paley|1809|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&viewtype=text&pageseq=437 431\u2013433], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&viewtype=text&pageseq=462 456].}}</ref> Paley's benevolent God acted in nature through uniform and universal laws, not arbitrary miracles or changes of laws, and this use of secondary laws provided a [[theodicy]] explaining the [[problem of evil]] by separating nature from direct divine action, drawing directly on the ideas of [[Thomas Malthus]]. For Paley, a [[Malthusian]] \"system of natural hostilities\" of animals living on prey was strictly connected to the surplus of births keeping the world appropriately stocked as circumstances changed, and poverty showed that the world was in a \"state of probation... calculated for the production, exercise, and improvement of moral qualities, with a view to a future state\", even where such divine purpose was not obvious. This convinced Charles and encouraged his interest in science.<ref name=syd5-9>{{Harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=5\u20139}}</ref> He later wrote \"I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's ''Natural Theology'': I could almost formerly have said it by heart.\"<ref name=Letter2532>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2532.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project \u2013 Letter 2532 \u2013 Darwin, C.

He concluded that the land had indeed risen, and referred to loose rock deposits as \"part of the long disputed Diluvium\". Around 1825 both Lyell and Sedgwick had supported [[William Buckland]]'s [[Catastrophism]] which postulated [[Flood geology|diluvialism]] to reconcile findings with the Biblical account of [[Noah's ark]], but by 1830 evidence had shown them that the \"[[diluvium]]\" had come from a series of local processes. They still distinguished between diluvial and alluvial deposits, but Sedgwick no longer thought these deposits were connected with Noah's flood by the time he taught Darwin, though the debate continued. Darwin's notes show him increasingly discounting \"debacles\" to account for such formations. It was only later that [[glaciation]] was accepted as the source of these deposits.<ref>{{harvnb|Herbert|1991|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A342&pageseq=10 168\u2013174]}}</ref>\n\nLyell's second volume explained extinctions as a \"succession of deaths\" due to changed circumstances with new species then being created, but Darwin found giant fossils of extinct mammals with no geological signs of a \"diluvial debacle\" or environmental change, and so rejected Lyell's explanation in favour of [[Giovanni Battista Brocchi]]'s idea that species had somehow aged and died out.<ref name=HurrahChiloe>{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.8.html |title=Darwin Online: 'Hurrah Chiloe': an introduction to the Port Desire Notebook |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> On the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]] he remained convinced by Lyell's idea of species spreading from \"centres of creation\",<ref name=K2001356>{{Harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1925&pageseq=388 356].}}</ref> and assumed that species had spread from the mainland rather than originating on these geologically recent volcanic islands.

I suppose it was the novelty of the argument that amused them. But I had gradually come, by this time, to see that the [[Old Testament]] from its manifestly false history of the world, with the [[Tower of Babel]], [[Covenant (biblical)#Noahic covenant|rainbow as a sign]], etc., etc., and from its attributing to God the feelings of a revengeful tyrant, was no more to be trusted than the [[Hindu scripture|sacred books of the Hindoos]], or the beliefs of any barbarian.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=87&itemID=F1497&viewtype=text 85].}}</ref>\n\nIn seeking to explain his observations, by early 1837 Darwin was speculating in his notebooks on [[transmutation of species]] and writing of \"my theory\". His journal for 1838 records \"All September read a good deal on many subject: thought much upon religion. Beginning of October ditto.\"  At this time he outlined ideas of comparative [[anthropology]], from his knowledge of different religious beliefs around the world as well as at various times in history, and came to the view that scriptures were unreliable and contradictory.<ref>{{harvnb|van Wyhe|Pallen|2012|pp=5\u20137}}</ref>\n\n===Discussions with Emma===\nHaving decided to marry, Darwin visited his cousin [[Emma Darwin|Emma]] on 29 July 1838 and told her of his ideas on transmutation.

[[Unitarianism]] emphasised inner feeling which overrode the authority of [[religious text]]s or [[doctrine]], and her beliefs resulted from intensive study and questioning. They socialised with the Unitarian clergymen [[James Martineau]] and [[John James Tayler]], and read their works as well as those of other Unitarian and [[liberal Christianity|liberal Anglican]] authors such as [[Francis William Newman]] whose ''Phases of faith'' described a spiritual journey from [[Calvinism]] to [[theism]], all part of widespread and heated debate on the authority of Anglicanism.

During Annie's long illness Darwin had read books by [[Francis William Newman]], a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] evolutionist who called for a new post-Christian synthesis and wrote that \"the fretfulness of a child is an infinite evil\". Darwin wrote at the time, \"Our only consolation is that she passed a short, though joyous life.\" For three years he had deliberated about the Christian meaning of mortality. This opened a new vision of tragically circumstantial nature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=377\u2013387}}</ref> His faith in Christianity had already dwindled away and he had stopped going to church.<ref name=jvw41/> He wrote out his memories of Annie, but no longer believed in an afterlife or in salvation.

In 1858 the information that [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] now had a similar theory forced an early joint [[publication of Darwin's theory]]. The [[reaction to Darwin's theory]], even after publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, was more muted than he had feared. One of the first responses to review copies came from [[Charles Kingsley]], a Christian socialist country rector and novelist, who wrote that it was \"just as noble a conception of Deity, to believe that He created primal forms capable of self development... as to believe that He required a fresh act of intervention to supply the lacunas which He Himself had made.\" For the second edition, Darwin added these lines to the last chapter, with attribution to \"a celebrated author and divine\".\n<ref name=Darwinanddesign>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/ |title=Darwin Correspondence Project \u2013 Darwin and design: historical essay |accessdate=17 February 2009}}</ref><ref name=Letter2534>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2534.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project \u2013 Letter 2534 \u2013 Kingsley, Charles to Darwin, C.

Not believing this, I see no necessity in the belief that the eye was expressly designed. On the other hand I cannot anyhow be contented to view this wonderful universe & especially the nature of man, & to conclude that everything is the result of brute force. I am inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance.

Though \"very unwilling to give up my belief\", he found that \"disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate, but was at last complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no distress, and have never since doubted even for a single second that my conclusion was correct.\" He noted how \"The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered\", and how Paley's [[teleological argument]] had difficulties with the [[problem of evil]].<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=87 84\u201392].}}</ref>\n\nEven when writing ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in the 1850s he was still inclined to [[theism]], but his views gradually changed to agnosticism:\n{{quote|Another source of conviction in the existence of God, connected with the reason and not with the feelings, impresses me as having much more weight. This follows from the extreme difficulty or rather impossibility of conceiving this immense and wonderful universe, including man with his capacity of looking far backwards and far into futurity, as the result of blind chance or necessity. When thus reflecting I feel compelled to look to a First Cause having an intelligent mind in some degree analogous to that of man; and I deserve to be called a Theist.<br/>\nThis conclusion was strong in my mind about the time, as far as I can remember, when I wrote the ''Origin of Species''; and it is since that time that it has very gradually with many fluctuations become weaker. But then arises the doubt\u2013can the mind of man, which has, as I fully believe, been developed from a mind as low as that possessed by the lowest animal, be trusted when it draws such grand conclusions? May not these be the result of the connection between cause and effect which strikes us as a necessary one, but probably depends merely on inherited experience? Nor must we overlook the probability of the constant inculcation in a belief in God on the minds of children producing so strong and perhaps an inherited effect on their brains not yet fully developed, that it would be as difficult for them to throw off their belief in God, as for a monkey to throw off its instinctive fear and hatred of a snake.\n\nI cannot pretend to throw the least light on such abstruse problems. The mystery of the beginning of all things is insoluble by us; and I for one must be content to remain an Agnostic.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&viewtype=text&pageseq=94 92\u201394].}}</ref>}}\n\n==Downe parish==\nAlthough he is commonly portrayed as being in conflict with the [[Church of England]], Darwin was supportive of the local parish church.<ref name=church />\n\nOn moving to [[Downe]], Kent in 1842, Darwin supported the parish church's work, and became a good friend of the Revd. [[John Brodie Innes|John Innes]] who took over in 1846. Darwin contributed to the church, helped with parish assistance and proposed a benefit society which became the ''Down Friendly Society'' with Darwin as guardian and treasurer. His wife [[Emma Darwin]] became known throughout the parish for helping in the way a parson's wife might be expected to, and as well as providing nursing care for her own family's frequent illnesses she gave out bread tokens to the hungry and \"small pensions for the old, dainties for the ailing, and medical comforts and simple medicine\".{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=332, 398, 461}}\n\nInnes inherited his family home of Milton Brodie, in the [[Scottish Highlands]] near [[Forres]]. In 1862 he retired there and changed his name to Brodie Innes,{{sfn|Freeman|2007|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A27b&viewtype=text&pageseq=179 172]}} leaving the parish in the dubious hands of his curate, the Revd. Stevens, while still remaining the patron. The meagre \"living\" and lack of a vicarage made it hard to attract a priest of quality. Innes made Darwin treasurer of Downe village school and they continued to correspond, with Innes seeking help and advice on parish matters. The Revd. Stevens proved lax, and departed in 1867. His successors were worse, one absconding with the school's funds and the church organ fund after Darwin mistakenly shared the treasurer's duties with him: Brodie Innes offered to sell Darwin the [[advowson]], or right to appoint the parish priest, but Darwin declined. The next was rumoured to have disgraced himself by \"walking with girls at night\". Darwin now became involved in helping Innes with detective work, subsequently advising him that the gossip that had reached Innes was not backed up by any reliable evidence.<ref name=church />{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=525, 563\u2013565}}\n\nA new reforming High Church vicar, the Revd. George Sketchley Ffinden, took over the parish in November 1871 and began imposing his ideas. Darwin had to write to Brodie Innes, explaining what had upset the parishioners. Ffinden now usurped control of the village school which had been run for years by a committee of Darwin, Lubbock and the incumbent priest, with a \"conscience clause\" which protected the children from [[Anglican]] indoctrination. Ffinden began lessons on the ''[[Thirty-nine Articles]] of the Anglican faith'', an unwelcome move from the point of view of the [[Baptists]] who had a chapel in the village. Darwin withdrew from the committee and cut his annual donation to the church, but continued with the Friendly Society work.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=600}}\n\nFor two years Emma organised a winter reading room in the local school for local labourers, who subscribed a penny a week to smoke and play games, with \"Respectable newspapers & a few books... & a respectable housekeeper..there every evening to maintain decorum.\" This was a common facility to save men from \"resorting to the [[public house]]\". In 1873 the Revd. Ffinden opposed it, as \"Coffee drinking, bagatelle & other games\" had been allowed and \"the effects of tobacco smoke & spitting\" were seen when the children returned in the morning. Emma got Darwin to get the approval of the education inspectorate in London, and just before Christmas 1873 the Darwins and their neighbours the Lubbocks got the agreement of the school committee, offering to pay for any repairs needed \"to afford every possible opportunity to the working class for self improvement & amusement\". A furious Ffinden huffed that it was \"quite out of order\" for the Darwins to have gone to the inspectorate behind his back. Darwin's health suffered as he argued over [[natural selection]] with [[St. George Jackson Mivart]], and in the autumn of 1874 Darwin expressed his exasperation at Ffinden when putting in his resignation from the school committee due to ill health.<ref name=church />{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=605\u2013606, 612}}\n\nFfinden then refused to speak to any of the Darwins, and when two evening lectures were proposed for the village in 1875, Lubbock had to act as an intermediary in requesting use of the schoolroom. The committee agreed, but Ffinden refused to co-operate, writing that \"I had long been aware of the harmful tendencies to revealed religion of Mr. Darwin's views, but.. I had fully determined.. not to let my difference of opinion interfere with a friendly feeling as neighbours, trusting that God's grace might in time bring one so highly gifted intellectually and morally to a better mind.\" Darwin was equally haughty in return, condescending that \"If Mr. F bows to Mrs D. and myself, we will return it\".{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=614, 638\u2013639}}\n\nThe dispute with Ffinden reflected the Church of England narrowing its social provision to its own adherents as secular provision of education became more widespread. Though Darwin no longer attended church, he was willing to give patronage to Non-conformism, and the family welcomed and supported the work of the Non-conformist evangelist [[J. W. C. Fegan]] in the village of Downe.<ref name=church />\n\n==Religion as an evolved social characteristic==\nIn his 1871 book ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' Darwin clearly saw religion and \"moral qualities\" as being important evolved human social characteristics. Darwin's frequent pairing of \"Belief in God\" and religion with topics on superstitions and fetishism throughout the book can also be interpreted as indicating how much truth he assigned to the former.\n\nIn the introduction Darwin wrote:\n\n: \"Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.\"{{sfn|Darwin|1871|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=16&itemID=F937.1&viewtype=side 3, Vol. 1]}}\n\nLater on in the book he dismisses an argument for religion being innate:\n\n: \"Belief in God \u2014 Religion. \u2014 There is no evidence that man was aboriginally endowed with the ennobling belief in the existence of an Omnipotent God. On the contrary there is ample evidence, derived not from hasty travellers, but from men who have long resided with savages, that numerous races have existed, and still exist, who have no idea of one or more gods, and who have no words in their languages to express such an idea. The question is of course wholly distinct from that higher one, whether there exists a Creator and Ruler of the universe; and this has been answered in the affirmative by some of the highest intellects that have ever existed.\"{{sfn|Darwin|1871|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=78&itemID=F937.1&viewtype=side 65, Vol. 1]}}\n\n: \"The belief in God has often been advanced as not only the greatest, but the most complete of all the distinctions between man and the lower animals. It is however impossible, as we have seen, to maintain that this belief is innate or instinctive in man. On the other hand a belief in all-pervading spiritual agencies seems to be universal; and apparently follows from a considerable advance in man's reason, and from a still greater advance in his faculties of imagination, curiosity and wonder. I am aware that the assumed instinctive belief in God has been used by many persons as an argument for His existence. But this is a rash argument, as we should thus be compelled to believe in the existence of many cruel and malignant spirits, only a little more powerful than man; for the belief in them is far more general than in a beneficent Deity. The idea of a universal and beneficent Creator does not seem to arise in the mind of man, until he has been elevated by long-continued culture.\"{{sfn|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=411&itemID=F937.2&viewtype=side 394\u2013395, Vol. 2]}}\n\n==Enquiries about religious views==\n[[File:Charles Darwin 1880.jpg|thumb|The classic image of Darwin as an old man]]\n\nFame and honours brought a stream of enquiries about Darwin's religious views, leading him to comment \"Half the fools throughout Europe write to ask me the stupidest questions.\"<ref name=Letter11982>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-11982.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project \u2013 Letter 11982 \u2013 Darwin, C.

Nor can I overlook the difficulty from the immense amount of suffering through the world. I am, also, induced to defer to a certain extent to the judgment of many able men who have fully believed in God; but here again I see how poor an argument this is.

In my Journal I wrote that whilst standing in the midst of the grandeur of a Brazilian forest, 'it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder, admiration, and devotion, which fill and elevate the mind.' I well remember my conviction that there is more in man than the mere breath of his body. But now the grandest scenes would not cause any such convictions and feelings to rise in my mind.\"{{sfn|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=329&itemID=F1452.1&viewtype=side 311]}}\n\nIn November 1878 when [[George Romanes]] presented his new book refuting theism, ''A Candid Examination of Theism'' by \"Physicus\", Darwin read it with \"very great interest\", but found it unconvincing; the arguments it put forward left open the possibility that God had initially created matter and energy with the potential of evolving to become organised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-11773 |title=Letter 11773 \u2013 Darwin, C.

In response, the secularist [[Edward Aveling]] toured the country leading protests.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=642\u2013645}}</ref> In October of that year Aveling wanted to dedicate his book on ''Darwin and his Works'' to Darwin and asked him for permission. Darwin declined, writing that \"though I am a strong advocate for free thought on all subjects, yet it appears to me (whether rightly or wrongly) that direct arguments against Christianity & theism produce hardly any effect on the public; & freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds, which follows from the advance of science. It has, therefore, been always my object to avoid writing on religion, & I have confined myself to science.

When the eminent [[Freethought|Freethinker]] Doctor [[Ludwig B\u00fcchner]] requested an audience he thought he was greeting a noble ally. To Darwin this was a grotesque misunderstanding, but he felt unable to refuse. Darwin's wife [[Emma Darwin]] expressed her expectation that their guest \"will refrain from airing his very strong religious opinions\" and invited their old friend the Revd. [[John Brodie Innes]]. On Thursday 28 September 1881 B\u00fcchner arrived with [[Edward Aveling]]. Darwin's son [[Francis Darwin|Frank]] was also present. Darwin wittily explained that \"[Brodie] & I have been fast friends for 30 years. We never thoroughly agreed on any subject but once and then we looked at each other and thought one of us must be very ill\".<ref name=dm656/>\n\nIn uncharacteristically bold discussions after dinner Darwin asked his guests \"Why do you call yourselves Atheists?\" When they responded that they \"did not commit the folly of god-denial, [and] avoided with equal care the folly of god-assertion\", Darwin gave a thoughtful response, concluding that \"I am with you in thought, but I should prefer the word Agnostic to the word Atheist.\" Aveling replied that, \"after all, 'Agnostic' was but 'Atheist' writ respectable, and 'Atheist' was only 'Agnostic' writ aggressive.\" Darwin smiled and responded \"Why should you be so aggressive? Is anything gained by trying to force these new ideas upon the mass of mankind? It is all very well for educated, cultured, thoughtful people; but are the masses yet ripe for it?\" Aveling and B\u00fcchner questioned what would have happened if Darwin had been given that advice before publication of the ''Origin'', and had confined \"the revolutionary truths of Natural and Sexual Selection to the judicious few\", where would the world be? Many feared danger if new ideas were \"proclaimed abroad on the house-tops, and discussed in market-place and home. But he, happily for humanity, had by the gentle, irresistible power of reason, forced his new ideas upon the mass of the people. And the masses had been found ripe for it. Had he kept silence, the tremendous strides taken by human thought during the last twenty-one years would have been shorn of their fair proportions, perhaps had hardly been made at all. His own illustrious example was encouragement, was for a command to every thinker to make known to all his fellows that which he believed to be the truth.\"<ref name=dm656/><ref name=ave/>\n\nTheir talk turned to religion, and Darwin said \"I never gave up Christianity until I was forty years of age.\" He agreed that Christianity was \"not supported by the evidence\", but he had reached this conclusion only slowly. Aveling recorded this discussion, and published it in 1883 as a [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|penny]] pamphlet.<ref name=dm656>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=656\u2013658}}</ref><ref name=ave>{{harvnb|Aveling|1883|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A234&pageseq=4 4\u20136]}}</ref> Francis Darwin thought it gave \"quite fairly his impressions of my father's views, but took issue with any suggestion of similar religious views, saying \"My father's replies implied his preference for the unaggressive attitude of an Agnostic.

But, in my judgment, it is precisely differences of this kind which distinguish him so completely from the class of thinkers to which Dr. Aveling belongs.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.1&viewtype=text&pageseq=335 317]}}</ref>\n\n==Funeral==\nDarwin's [[Westminster Abbey]] funeral expressed a public feeling of national pride, and religious writers of all persuasions praised his \"noble character and his ardent pursuit of truth\", calling him a \"true Christian gentleman\". In particular the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and free religionists, proud of his Dissenting upbringing, supported his naturalistic views. The Unitarian [[William Benjamin Carpenter|William Carpenter]] carried a resolution praising Darwin's unravelling of \"the immutable laws of the Divine Government\", shedding light on \"the progress of humanity\", and the Unitarian preacher [[John White Chadwick]] from New York wrote that \"The nation's grandest temple of religion opened its gates and lifted up its everlasting doors and bade the King of Science come in.\"\n\n==Posthumous ''Autobiography''==\nDarwin decided to leave a posthumous memoir for his family, and on Sunday 28 May 1876 he began ''Recollections of the Development of my mind and character''. He found this candid private memoir easy going, covering his childhood, university, life on the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' expedition]] and developing work in science. A section headed \"Religious Belief\" opened just before his marriage, and frankly discussed his long disagreement with Emma. At first he had been unwilling to give up his faith, and had tried to \"invent evidence\" supporting the Gospels, but just as his clerical career had died a slow \"natural death\", so too did his belief in \"Christianity as a divine revelation\". \"Inward convictions and feelings\" had arisen from natural selection, as had survival instincts, and could not be relied on.

Only in 1958 did Darwin's granddaughter [[Nora Barlow]] publish a revised version which contained the omissions.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=87 84\u201396].}}</ref> This included statements discussed above in [[#Autobiography on gradually increasing disbelief|Autobiography on gradually increasing disbelief]], and others such as the following:\n\n: \"By further reflecting that the clearest evidence would be requisite to make any sane man believe in the miracles by which Christianity is supported, \u2014 that the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the more incredible, do miracles become, \u2014 that the men at that time were ignorant and credulous to a degree almost incomprehensible by us, \u2014 that the [[Gospels]] cannot be proved to have been written simultaneously with the events, \u2013 that they differ in many important details, far too important as it seemed to me to be admitted as the usual inaccuracies of eyewitness; \u2013 by such reflections as these, which I give not as having the least novelty or value, but as they influenced me, I gradually came to disbelieve in Christianity as a divine revelation. The fact that many false religions have spread over large portions of the earth like wild-fire had some weight with me. Beautiful as is the morality of the [[New Testament]], it can hardly be denied that its perfection depends in part on the interpretation which we now put on metaphors and allegories.\" (p.86)\n\n: \"I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable [[doctrine]].\" (p. 87)\n\n: \"The old argument of design in nature, as given by [[William Paley|Paley]], which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection had been discovered. We can no longer argue that, for instance, the beautiful hinge of a [[bivalve shell]] must have been made by an intelligent being, like the hinge of a door by man. There seems to be no more design in the variability of organic beings and in the action of natural selection, than in the course which the wind blows. Everything in nature is the result of fixed laws.\" (p.87)\n\n: \"At the present day (ca. 1872) the most usual argument for the existence of an intelligent God is drawn from the deep inward conviction and feelings which are experienced by most persons. But it cannot be doubted that [[Hindu|Hindoos]], [[Islam|Mahomadans]] and others might argue in the same manner and with equal force in favor of the existence of one God, or of many Gods, or as with the [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] of no God...This argument would be a valid one if all men of all races had the same inward conviction of the existence of one God: but we know that this is very far from being the case. Therefore I cannot see that such inward convictions and feelings are of any weight as evidence of what really exists.\" (p.91)\n\n==The Lady Hope Story==\nThe \"[[Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope|Lady Hope Story]]\", first published in 1915, claimed that Darwin had reverted to Christianity on his sickbed.

His [[British Whig Party|Whig]] supporting extended [[Darwin\u2013Wedgwood family|family of Darwins and Wedgwoods]] was strongly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], though one of his grandfathers, [[Erasmus Darwin]], was a [[Freethought|freethinker]], and his father was quietly a freethinker but as a physician avoided any social conflict with his wealthy Anglican patrons. While Darwin's parents were open enough to changing social pressures to have Charles [[baptism|baptised]] in the Church of England, his pious mother took the children to the Unitarian chapel. After her death when he was only eight he became a [[boarding school|boarder]] at the ''[[Shrewsbury School]]'', an Anglican [[public school (England)|public school]].<ref name=skool/>\n\n===Edinburgh \u2013 medical studies and Lamarckian evolution theory===\nThe two universities in England namely [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], were under the Church of England and required students to sign the ''[[Thirty-nine Articles]] of the [[Anglican]] faith'', so many English Non-conformists sent their children to the Scottish universities which had a better reputation in fields like medicine.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=22}}</ref> Charles initially attended the [[University of Edinburgh]], and while he was put off medicine he took an active interest in [[natural history]] at the [[Plinian Society]]. One of his proposers for the society was the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] [[William A. F. Browne]], and on 27 March 1827 Browne argued that mind and consciousness were simply aspects of brain activity, not \"souls\" or spiritual entities separate from the body. A furious debate ensued, and later someone struck out all mention of this [[materialism|materialist]] heresy from the minutes. This was the first time that Darwin was exposed to militant [[freethought]] and the arguments it aroused.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=38}}</ref> On one occasion [[Robert Edmund Grant]] discussed [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck's]] [[Lamarckism|evolutionary ideas]]. Darwin was astonished, but had recently read the similar ideas of his grandfather Erasmus and remained indifferent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=72\u201388}}</ref>\n\nNatural history had grown from the idea that the different kinds of plants and animals showed the wonder of God's [[Genesis creation myth|creation]], making their study and cataloguing into species worthwhile. In Darwin's day it was common for clergymen to be naturalists, though scientific findings had already opened up [[history of creationism|ideas on creation]]. The established churches (of England and Scotland) and the English universities remained insistent that species were divinely created and man was distinct from the \"lower orders\", but the Unitarian church rejected this teaching and even proclaimed that the human [[mind]] was subject to physical law. [[Erasmus Darwin]] went further and his ''[[Zo\u00f6nomia]]'' asks \"...would it be too bold to imagine that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which the great First Cause endued with animality.... possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down these improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end!\", anticipating [[Lamarckism]].\n\n===Cambridge \u2013 theology and geology===\nWhen Darwin proved unable to persevere at medical studies, his father sent him to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], for a Bachelor of Arts degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican [[parson]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=47\u201348}}</ref> Darwin was at first uncertain, he later wrote: \"from what little I had heard and thought on the subject I had scruples about declaring my belief in all the dogmas of the Church of England; though otherwise I liked the thought of being a country clergyman. Accordingly I read with care '[[John Pearson (bishop)|Pearson]] [[Exposition of the Creed|on the Creed]]' and a few other books on [[divinity]]; and as I did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself that our [[Creed]] must be fully accepted. It never struck me how illogical it was to say that I believed in what I could not understand and what is in fact unintelligible. I might have said with entire truth that I had no wish to dispute any dogma; but I never was such a fool as to feel and say '[[Credo quia absurdum|credo quia incredibile]]\".<ref name=dar57/> He was particularly convinced by the reasoning of [[John Bird Sumner]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity'' which set out the logic that the unbelief of [[Religious skepticism|sceptics]] gave them the dilemma that if Christianity were untrue, then either \"Jesus did not live, or he actually lived, but was not the Son of God, hence an imposter.\" The Gospels made this highly improbable, as his miracles had convinced unbelievers, hence we had \"no right to deny\" that such events were probable. Jesus's religion was \"wonderfully suitable... to our ideas of happiness in this & the next world\" and there was \"no other way... of explaining the series of evidence & probability.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=48\u201349}}</ref>\n\nThe university was essentially tied into the Church of England, with virtually all of the college heads and most of the professors and fellows having been ordained. About half of the undergraduates were destined for the church, like Darwin hoping for a comfortable parish. During Darwin's second year, the harmony was disturbed when Cambridge was briefly visited by the [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] [[Richard Carlile]] and the Revd [[Robert Taylor (Radical)|Robert Taylor]] on an \"infidel home missionary tour\", causing a stir before being banned. Taylor would be remembered by Darwin as \"the [[Devil]]'s Chaplain\", a warning example of an outcast from society who had challenged Christianity and had been imprisoned for [[blasphemy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=50, 70\u201373}}</ref>\n\nIn his third year, he joined [[John Stevens Henslow]]'s natural history course and was introduced to the Cambridge version of [[natural theology]], part of the [[liberal Christianity]] of colleagues such as [[Adam Sedgwick]], [[George Peacock]] and [[William Whewell]] who all had strong views about science as the search for the laws of nature. Study of nature was study of the work of the Lord, and scientists who were ordained clerics of the Church of England, such as themselves, could follow their enquiries without theological difficulties. Sedgwick gave a talk to the [[Geological Society of London]] in 1831 which declared that \"No opinion can be heretical, but that which is not true.... Conflicting falsehoods we can comprehend; but truths can never war against each other. I affirm, therefore, that we have nothing to fear from the results of our enquiries, provided they be followed in the laborious but secure road of honest induction. In this way we may rest assured that we shall never arrive at conclusions opposed to any truth, either physical or moral, from whatever source that truth may be derived.\" For these men, science could not be out of harmony with religion, and in a sense it was religion.<ref name=browne126>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=126\u2013129}}</ref>\n\nUnder pressure in the fourth year, Darwin worked hard at his studies, getting tuition in theology by Henslow. Darwin became particularly interested in the Revd [[William Paley]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity'' and ''Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy'', which were set texts. The latter was becoming outdated. It opposed arguments for increased democracy, but saw no divine right of rule for the sovereign or the state, only \"expediency\". Government could be opposed if grievances outweighed the danger and expense to society. The judgement was \"Every man for himself\". These ideas had suited the conditions of reasonable rule prevailing when the text was published in 1785, but in 1830 they were dangerous ideas at a time when the French king was deposed by middle class republicans and given refuge in England by the [[Tory]] government, and resulting radical street protests demanded [[suffrage]], [[Social equality|equality]] and [[freedom of religion]]. Paley's text even supported abolition of the ''[[Thirty-nine Articles]]'' of the Anglican faith which every student at Cambridge (and [[Oxford University]]) was required to sign. Henslow insisted that \"he should be grieved if a single word of the Thirty-nine Articles were altered\" and emphasised the need to respect authority. Darwin later wrote that he was convinced that he \"could have written out the whole of the ''Evidences'' with perfect correctness, but not of course in the clear language of Paley. The logic of this book and as I may add of his ''Natural Theology'' gave me as much delight as did [[Euclid]].\"<ref name=\"Darwin 1958\">{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=69 67\u201368].}}</ref>\n\nAfter doing particularly well in his final exam questions on Paleys' books, Darwin read Paley's ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity|Natural Theology]]'' which set out to refute [[David Hume]]'s argument that the [[teleological argument]] for \"design\" by a Creator was merely a human projection onto the forces of nature. Paley saw a rational proof of God's existence in the complexity and perfect [[adaptation]] to needs of living beings exquisitely fitted to their places in a happy world, while attacking the evolutionary ideas of [[Erasmus Darwin]] as coinciding with atheistic schemes and lacking evidence.<ref>{{harvnb|Paley|1809|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&viewtype=text&pageseq=437 431\u2013433], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&viewtype=text&pageseq=462 456].}}</ref> Paley's benevolent God acted in nature through uniform and universal laws, not arbitrary miracles or changes of laws, and this use of secondary laws provided a [[theodicy]] explaining the [[problem of evil]] by separating nature from direct divine action, drawing directly on the ideas of [[Thomas Malthus]]. For Paley, a [[Malthusian]] \"system of natural hostilities\" of animals living on prey was strictly connected to the surplus of births keeping the world appropriately stocked as circumstances changed, and poverty showed that the world was in a \"state of probation... calculated for the production, exercise, and improvement of moral qualities, with a view to a future state\", even where such divine purpose was not obvious. This convinced Charles and encouraged his interest in science.<ref name=syd5-9>{{Harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=5\u20139}}</ref> He later wrote \"I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's ''Natural Theology'': I could almost formerly have said it by heart.\"<ref name=Letter2532>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2532.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project \u2013 Letter 2532 \u2013 Darwin, C.

He returned to find that his arrangements had fallen through, but was given the opportunity to join the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' survey expedition]] as a gentleman naturalist and companion to captain [[Robert FitzRoy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=70 68\u201372].}}</ref> Before they left England FitzRoy gave Darwin a copy of the first volume of [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'', the subject which would be his primary work.\n\nDarwin was questioning from the outset, and in his first zoology notes he wondered why deep-ocean [[plankton]] had been created with so much beauty for little purpose as no one could see them.<ref name=plankton>{{Harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1925&viewtype=text&pageseq=53 21\u201322]}}</ref> He saw landforms as supporting Lyell's [[Uniformitarianism (science)|Uniformitarianism]] which explained features as the outcome of a gradual process over huge periods of time, and quickly showed a gift for theorising about the geology he was examining. He concluded that the land had indeed risen, and referred to loose rock deposits as \"part of the long disputed Diluvium\". Around 1825 both Lyell and Sedgwick had supported [[William Buckland]]'s [[Catastrophism]] which postulated [[Flood geology|diluvialism]] to reconcile findings with the Biblical account of [[Noah's ark]], but by 1830 evidence had shown them that the \"[[diluvium]]\" had come from a series of local processes. They still distinguished between diluvial and alluvial deposits, but Sedgwick no longer thought these deposits were connected with Noah's flood by the time he taught Darwin, though the debate continued. Darwin's notes show him increasingly discounting \"debacles\" to account for such formations. It was only later that [[glaciation]] was accepted as the source of these deposits.<ref>{{harvnb|Herbert|1991|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A342&pageseq=10 168\u2013174]}}</ref>\n\nLyell's second volume explained extinctions as a \"succession of deaths\" due to changed circumstances with new species then being created, but Darwin found giant fossils of extinct mammals with no geological signs of a \"diluvial debacle\" or environmental change, and so rejected Lyell's explanation in favour of [[Giovanni Battista Brocchi]]'s idea that species had somehow aged and died out.<ref name=HurrahChiloe>{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.8.html |title=Darwin Online: 'Hurrah Chiloe': an introduction to the Port Desire Notebook |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> On the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]] he remained convinced by Lyell's idea of species spreading from \"centres of creation\",<ref name=K2001356>{{Harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1925&pageseq=388 356].}}</ref> and assumed that species had spread from the mainland rather than originating on these geologically recent volcanic islands.

But I had gradually come, by this time, to see that the [[Old Testament]] from its manifestly false history of the world, with the [[Tower of Babel]], [[Covenant (biblical)#Noahic covenant|rainbow as a sign]], etc., etc., and from its attributing to God the feelings of a revengeful tyrant, was no more to be trusted than the [[Hindu scripture|sacred books of the Hindoos]], or the beliefs of any barbarian.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=87&itemID=F1497&viewtype=text 85].}}</ref>\n\nIn seeking to explain his observations, by early 1837 Darwin was speculating in his notebooks on [[transmutation of species]] and writing of \"my theory\". His journal for 1838 records \"All September read a good deal on many subject: thought much upon religion.

[[Unitarianism]] emphasised inner feeling which overrode the authority of [[religious text]]s or [[doctrine]], and her beliefs resulted from intensive study and questioning. They socialised with the Unitarian clergymen [[James Martineau]] and [[John James Tayler]], and read their works as well as those of other Unitarian and [[liberal Christianity|liberal Anglican]] authors such as [[Francis William Newman]] whose ''Phases of faith'' described a spiritual journey from [[Calvinism]] to [[theism]], all part of widespread and heated debate on the authority of Anglicanism. In [[Downe]] Emma attended the Anglican village church, but as a Unitarian had the family turn round in silence when the [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] [[Nicene Creed]] was recited.<ref name=Belief/>\n\nSoon after their marriage, Emma, while writing about Darwin, felt that \"while you [Charles] are acting conscientiously & sincerely wishing, & trying to learn the truth, you cannot be wrong\", and though concerned at the threat to faith of the \"habit in scientific pursuits of believing nothing till it is proved\", Emma\u2019s hope that he did not \"consider his opinion as formed\" proved correct.

During the service, Emma continued to face forward when the congregation turned to face the altar for the Creed, sticking to her [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] faith.\n\n===Death of Annie===\nAt the end of June 1850 his bright nine-year-old daughter [[Anne Darwin|Annie]] who had become a particular favourite and comfort to him fell sick and, after a painful illness, died on 23 April 1851. During Annie's long illness Darwin had read books by [[Francis William Newman]], a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] evolutionist who called for a new post-Christian synthesis and wrote that \"the fretfulness of a child is an infinite evil\". Darwin wrote at the time, \"Our only consolation is that she passed a short, though joyous life.\" For three years he had deliberated about the Christian meaning of mortality. This opened a new vision of tragically circumstantial nature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=377\u2013387}}</ref> His faith in Christianity had already dwindled away and he had stopped going to church.<ref name=jvw41/> He wrote out his memories of Annie, but no longer believed in an afterlife or in salvation. Emma believed that Annie had gone to heaven and told this to the children, with the unfortunate result that [[Etty Darwin|Henrietta]] wondered, \"If all the angels were men, did women go to heaven?\" She worried for months that her naughtiness while Annie was alive would mean that she would go to hell unless God forgave her.<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=502\u2013503}}</ref>\n\n===''On the Origin of Species''===\nDarwin continued to avoid public controversy and to accumulate evidence supporting his theory against the anticipated arguments. In 1858 the information that [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] now had a similar theory forced an early joint [[publication of Darwin's theory]]. The [[reaction to Darwin's theory]], even after publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, was more muted than he had feared. One of the first responses to review copies came from [[Charles Kingsley]], a Christian socialist country rector and novelist, who wrote that it was \"just as noble a conception of Deity, to believe that He created primal forms capable of self development... as to believe that He required a fresh act of intervention to supply the lacunas which He Himself had made.\" For the second edition, Darwin added these lines to the last chapter, with attribution to \"a celebrated author and divine\".\n<ref name=Darwinanddesign>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/ |title=Darwin Correspondence Project \u2013 Darwin and design: historical essay |accessdate=17 February 2009}}</ref><ref name=Letter2534>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2534.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project \u2013 Letter 2534 \u2013 Kingsley, Charles to Darwin, C.

Their new \"[[higher criticism]]\" represented \"the triumph of the rational discourse of logos over myth.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} It argued that the Bible should not be read in an entirely literal manner, thus and would in the future become \"a bogey of Christian fundamentalists ... but this was only because Western people had lost the original sense of the mythical.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The traditional Christians were just as vocal.\n\nThere was close correspondence between Darwin and his American collaborator [[Asa Gray]], a devout [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] who discussed with him the relationship of [[natural selection]] to [[natural theology]] and published several reviews arguing in detail that they were fully compatible. Darwin financed a pamphlet publishing a collection of these reviews for distribution in Britain.<ref name=Darwinanddesign/> In one 1860 letter to Gray, Darwin expressed his doubts about the [[teleological argument]] which claimed nature as evidence of god, though he was still inclined to vaguely believe in an impersonal [[deism|God as first cause]]:<ref name=q118>{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=119\u2013121}}</ref>\n{{quote|With respect to the theological view of the question; this is always painful to me.\u2014 I am bewildered.\u2013 I had no intention to write atheistically.

I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent &  omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonid\u00e6 with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice. Not believing this, I see no necessity in the belief that the eye was expressly designed. On the other hand I cannot anyhow be contented to view this wonderful universe & especially the nature of man, & to conclude that everything is the result of brute force. I am inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect.

Though \"very unwilling to give up my belief\", he found that \"disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate, but was at last complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no distress, and have never since doubted even for a single second that my conclusion was correct.\" He noted how \"The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered\", and how Paley's [[teleological argument]] had difficulties with the [[problem of evil]].<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=87 84\u201392].}}</ref>\n\nEven when writing ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in the 1850s he was still inclined to [[theism]], but his views gradually changed to agnosticism:\n{{quote|Another source of conviction in the existence of God, connected with the reason and not with the feelings, impresses me as having much more weight. This follows from the extreme difficulty or rather impossibility of conceiving this immense and wonderful universe, including man with his capacity of looking far backwards and far into futurity, as the result of blind chance or necessity. When thus reflecting I feel compelled to look to a First Cause having an intelligent mind in some degree analogous to that of man; and I deserve to be called a Theist.<br/>\nThis conclusion was strong in my mind about the time, as far as I can remember, when I wrote the ''Origin of Species''; and it is since that time that it has very gradually with many fluctuations become weaker. But then arises the doubt\u2013can the mind of man, which has, as I fully believe, been developed from a mind as low as that possessed by the lowest animal, be trusted when it draws such grand conclusions? May not these be the result of the connection between cause and effect which strikes us as a necessary one, but probably depends merely on inherited experience? Nor must we overlook the probability of the constant inculcation in a belief in God on the minds of children producing so strong and perhaps an inherited effect on their brains not yet fully developed, that it would be as difficult for them to throw off their belief in God, as for a monkey to throw off its instinctive fear and hatred of a snake.\n\nI cannot pretend to throw the least light on such abstruse problems. The mystery of the beginning of all things is insoluble by us; and I for one must be content to remain an Agnostic.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&viewtype=text&pageseq=94 92\u201394].}}</ref>}}\n\n==Downe parish==\nAlthough he is commonly portrayed as being in conflict with the [[Church of England]], Darwin was supportive of the local parish church.<ref name=church />\n\nOn moving to [[Downe]], Kent in 1842, Darwin supported the parish church's work, and became a good friend of the Revd. [[John Brodie Innes|John Innes]] who took over in 1846. Darwin contributed to the church, helped with parish assistance and proposed a benefit society which became the ''Down Friendly Society'' with Darwin as guardian and treasurer. His wife [[Emma Darwin]] became known throughout the parish for helping in the way a parson's wife might be expected to, and as well as providing nursing care for her own family's frequent illnesses she gave out bread tokens to the hungry and \"small pensions for the old, dainties for the ailing, and medical comforts and simple medicine\".{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=332, 398, 461}}\n\nInnes inherited his family home of Milton Brodie, in the [[Scottish Highlands]] near [[Forres]]. In 1862 he retired there and changed his name to Brodie Innes,{{sfn|Freeman|2007|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A27b&viewtype=text&pageseq=179 172]}} leaving the parish in the dubious hands of his curate, the Revd. Stevens, while still remaining the patron. The meagre \"living\" and lack of a vicarage made it hard to attract a priest of quality. Innes made Darwin treasurer of Downe village school and they continued to correspond, with Innes seeking help and advice on parish matters. The Revd. Stevens proved lax, and departed in 1867. His successors were worse, one absconding with the school's funds and the church organ fund after Darwin mistakenly shared the treasurer's duties with him: Brodie Innes offered to sell Darwin the [[advowson]], or right to appoint the parish priest, but Darwin declined. The next was rumoured to have disgraced himself by \"walking with girls at night\". Darwin now became involved in helping Innes with detective work, subsequently advising him that the gossip that had reached Innes was not backed up by any reliable evidence.<ref name=church />{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=525, 563\u2013565}}\n\nA new reforming High Church vicar, the Revd. George Sketchley Ffinden, took over the parish in November 1871 and began imposing his ideas. Darwin had to write to Brodie Innes, explaining what had upset the parishioners. Ffinden now usurped control of the village school which had been run for years by a committee of Darwin, Lubbock and the incumbent priest, with a \"conscience clause\" which protected the children from [[Anglican]] indoctrination. Ffinden began lessons on the ''[[Thirty-nine Articles]] of the Anglican faith'', an unwelcome move from the point of view of the [[Baptists]] who had a chapel in the village. Darwin withdrew from the committee and cut his annual donation to the church, but continued with the Friendly Society work.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=600}}\n\nFor two years Emma organised a winter reading room in the local school for local labourers, who subscribed a penny a week to smoke and play games, with \"Respectable newspapers & a few books... & a respectable housekeeper..there every evening to maintain decorum.\" This was a common facility to save men from \"resorting to the [[public house]]\". In 1873 the Revd. Ffinden opposed it, as \"Coffee drinking, bagatelle & other games\" had been allowed and \"the effects of tobacco smoke & spitting\" were seen when the children returned in the morning. Emma got Darwin to get the approval of the education inspectorate in London, and just before Christmas 1873 the Darwins and their neighbours the Lubbocks got the agreement of the school committee, offering to pay for any repairs needed \"to afford every possible opportunity to the working class for self improvement & amusement\". A furious Ffinden huffed that it was \"quite out of order\" for the Darwins to have gone to the inspectorate behind his back. Darwin's health suffered as he argued over [[natural selection]] with [[St. George Jackson Mivart]], and in the autumn of 1874 Darwin expressed his exasperation at Ffinden when putting in his resignation from the school committee due to ill health.<ref name=church />{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=605\u2013606, 612}}\n\nFfinden then refused to speak to any of the Darwins, and when two evening lectures were proposed for the village in 1875, Lubbock had to act as an intermediary in requesting use of the schoolroom. The committee agreed, but Ffinden refused to co-operate, writing that \"I had long been aware of the harmful tendencies to revealed religion of Mr. Darwin's views, but.. I had fully determined.. not to let my difference of opinion interfere with a friendly feeling as neighbours, trusting that God's grace might in time bring one so highly gifted intellectually and morally to a better mind.\" Darwin was equally haughty in return, condescending that \"If Mr. F bows to Mrs D. and myself, we will return it\".{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=614, 638\u2013639}}\n\nThe dispute with Ffinden reflected the Church of England narrowing its social provision to its own adherents as secular provision of education became more widespread. Though Darwin no longer attended church, he was willing to give patronage to Non-conformism, and the family welcomed and supported the work of the Non-conformist evangelist [[J. W. C. Fegan]] in the village of Downe.<ref name=church />\n\n==Religion as an evolved social characteristic==\nIn his 1871 book ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' Darwin clearly saw religion and \"moral qualities\" as being important evolved human social characteristics. Darwin's frequent pairing of \"Belief in God\" and religion with topics on superstitions and fetishism throughout the book can also be interpreted as indicating how much truth he assigned to the former.\n\nIn the introduction Darwin wrote:\n\n: \"Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.\"{{sfn|Darwin|1871|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=16&itemID=F937.1&viewtype=side 3, Vol. 1]}}\n\nLater on in the book he dismisses an argument for religion being innate:\n\n: \"Belief in God \u2014 Religion. \u2014 There is no evidence that man was aboriginally endowed with the ennobling belief in the existence of an Omnipotent God. On the contrary there is ample evidence, derived not from hasty travellers, but from men who have long resided with savages, that numerous races have existed, and still exist, who have no idea of one or more gods, and who have no words in their languages to express such an idea. The question is of course wholly distinct from that higher one, whether there exists a Creator and Ruler of the universe; and this has been answered in the affirmative by some of the highest intellects that have ever existed.\"{{sfn|Darwin|1871|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=78&itemID=F937.1&viewtype=side 65, Vol. 1]}}\n\n: \"The belief in God has often been advanced as not only the greatest, but the most complete of all the distinctions between man and the lower animals. It is however impossible, as we have seen, to maintain that this belief is innate or instinctive in man. On the other hand a belief in all-pervading spiritual agencies seems to be universal; and apparently follows from a considerable advance in man's reason, and from a still greater advance in his faculties of imagination, curiosity and wonder. I am aware that the assumed instinctive belief in God has been used by many persons as an argument for His existence. But this is a rash argument, as we should thus be compelled to believe in the existence of many cruel and malignant spirits, only a little more powerful than man; for the belief in them is far more general than in a beneficent Deity. The idea of a universal and beneficent Creator does not seem to arise in the mind of man, until he has been elevated by long-continued culture.\"{{sfn|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=411&itemID=F937.2&viewtype=side 394\u2013395, Vol. 2]}}\n\n==Enquiries about religious views==\n[[File:Charles Darwin 1880.jpg|thumb|The classic image of Darwin as an old man]]\n\nFame and honours brought a stream of enquiries about Darwin's religious views, leading him to comment \"Half the fools throughout Europe write to ask me the stupidest questions.\"<ref name=Letter11982>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-11982.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project \u2013 Letter 11982 \u2013 Darwin, C.

In my Journal I wrote that whilst standing in the midst of the grandeur of a Brazilian forest, 'it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder, admiration, and devotion, which fill and elevate the mind.' I well remember my conviction that there is more in man than the mere breath of his body. But now the grandest scenes would not cause any such convictions and feelings to rise in my mind.\"{{sfn|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=329&itemID=F1452.1&viewtype=side 311]}}\n\nIn November 1878 when [[George Romanes]] presented his new book refuting theism, ''A Candid Examination of Theism'' by \"Physicus\", Darwin read it with \"very great interest\", but found it unconvincing; the arguments it put forward left open the possibility that God had initially created matter and energy with the potential of evolving to become organised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-11773 |title=Letter 11773 \u2013 Darwin, C.

Darwin replied that \"a man may be an ardent Theist and an evolutionist\", citing [[Charles Kingsley]] and [[Asa Gray]] as examples, and for himself, \"In my most extreme fluctuations I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God.\u2014 I think that generally (& more and more so as I grow older) but not always, that an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind.\"<ref name=\"Letter 12041\"/>\n\nThose opposing religion often took Darwin as their inspiration and expected his support for their cause, a role he firmly refused. In 1880 there was a huge controversy when the atheist [[Charles Bradlaugh]] was elected as a member of parliament and then prevented from taking his seat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. In response, the secularist [[Edward Aveling]] toured the country leading protests.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=642\u2013645}}</ref> In October of that year Aveling wanted to dedicate his book on ''Darwin and his Works'' to Darwin and asked him for permission. Darwin declined, writing that \"though I am a strong advocate for free thought on all subjects, yet it appears to me (whether rightly or wrongly) that direct arguments against Christianity & theism produce hardly any effect on the public; & freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds, which follows from the advance of science. It has, therefore, been always my object to avoid writing on religion, & I have confined myself to science. I may, however, have been unduly biased by the pain which it would give some members of my family, if I aided in any way direct attacks on religion.\"<ref name=\"Letter 12757\">{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-12757 |title=Letter 12757 \u2013 Darwin, C.

When the eminent [[Freethought|Freethinker]] Doctor [[Ludwig B\u00fcchner]] requested an audience he thought he was greeting a noble ally. To Darwin this was a grotesque misunderstanding, but he felt unable to refuse. Darwin's wife [[Emma Darwin]] expressed her expectation that their guest \"will refrain from airing his very strong religious opinions\" and invited their old friend the Revd. [[John Brodie Innes]]. On Thursday 28 September 1881 B\u00fcchner arrived with [[Edward Aveling]]. Darwin's son [[Francis Darwin|Frank]] was also present. Darwin wittily explained that \"[Brodie] & I have been fast friends for 30 years. We never thoroughly agreed on any subject but once and then we looked at each other and thought one of us must be very ill\".<ref name=dm656/>\n\nIn uncharacteristically bold discussions after dinner Darwin asked his guests \"Why do you call yourselves Atheists?\" When they responded that they \"did not commit the folly of god-denial, [and] avoided with equal care the folly of god-assertion\", Darwin gave a thoughtful response, concluding that \"I am with you in thought, but I should prefer the word Agnostic to the word Atheist.\" Aveling replied that, \"after all, 'Agnostic' was but 'Atheist' writ respectable, and 'Atheist' was only 'Agnostic' writ aggressive.\" Darwin smiled and responded \"Why should you be so aggressive? Is anything gained by trying to force these new ideas upon the mass of mankind? It is all very well for educated, cultured, thoughtful people; but are the masses yet ripe for it?\" Aveling and B\u00fcchner questioned what would have happened if Darwin had been given that advice before publication of the ''Origin'', and had confined \"the revolutionary truths of Natural and Sexual Selection to the judicious few\", where would the world be? Many feared danger if new ideas were \"proclaimed abroad on the house-tops, and discussed in market-place and home. But he, happily for humanity, had by the gentle, irresistible power of reason, forced his new ideas upon the mass of the people. And the masses had been found ripe for it. Had he kept silence, the tremendous strides taken by human thought during the last twenty-one years would have been shorn of their fair proportions, perhaps had hardly been made at all. His own illustrious example was encouragement, was for a command to every thinker to make known to all his fellows that which he believed to be the truth.\"<ref name=dm656/><ref name=ave/>\n\nTheir talk turned to religion, and Darwin said \"I never gave up Christianity until I was forty years of age.\" He agreed that Christianity was \"not supported by the evidence\", but he had reached this conclusion only slowly. Aveling recorded this discussion, and published it in 1883 as a [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|penny]] pamphlet.<ref name=dm656>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=656\u2013658}}</ref><ref name=ave>{{harvnb|Aveling|1883|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A234&pageseq=4 4\u20136]}}</ref> Francis Darwin thought it gave \"quite fairly his impressions of my father's views, but took issue with any suggestion of similar religious views, saying \"My father's replies implied his preference for the unaggressive attitude of an Agnostic. Dr. Aveling seems to regard the absence of aggressiveness in my father's views as distinguishing them in an unessential manner from his own. But, in my judgment, it is precisely differences of this kind which distinguish him so completely from the class of thinkers to which Dr. Aveling belongs.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.1&viewtype=text&pageseq=335 317]}}</ref>\n\n==Funeral==\nDarwin's [[Westminster Abbey]] funeral expressed a public feeling of national pride, and religious writers of all persuasions praised his \"noble character and his ardent pursuit of truth\", calling him a \"true Christian gentleman\". In particular the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and free religionists, proud of his Dissenting upbringing, supported his naturalistic views. The Unitarian [[William Benjamin Carpenter|William Carpenter]] carried a resolution praising Darwin's unravelling of \"the immutable laws of the Divine Government\", shedding light on \"the progress of humanity\", and the Unitarian preacher [[John White Chadwick]] from New York wrote that \"The nation's grandest temple of religion opened its gates and lifted up its everlasting doors and bade the King of Science come in.\"\n\n==Posthumous ''Autobiography''==\nDarwin decided to leave a posthumous memoir for his family, and on Sunday 28 May 1876 he began ''Recollections of the Development of my mind and character''. He found this candid private memoir easy going, covering his childhood, university, life on the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' expedition]] and developing work in science. A section headed \"Religious Belief\" opened just before his marriage, and frankly discussed his long disagreement with Emma. At first he had been unwilling to give up his faith, and had tried to \"invent evidence\" supporting the Gospels, but just as his clerical career had died a slow \"natural death\", so too did his belief in \"Christianity as a divine revelation\". \"Inward convictions and feelings\" had arisen from natural selection, as had survival instincts, and could not be relied on. He was quick to show Emma's side of the story and pay tribute to \"your mother,&nbsp;... so infinitely my superior in every moral quality&nbsp;... my wise adviser and cheerful comforter\".{{sfn|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=98&itemID=F1497&viewtype=side 96\u201397]}}\n\n''[[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin]]'' was published posthumously, and quotes about Christianity were omitted by Darwin's wife [[Emma Darwin|Emma]] and his son [[Francis Darwin|Francis]] because they were deemed dangerous for Charles Darwin's reputation. Only in 1958 did Darwin's granddaughter [[Nora Barlow]] publish a revised version which contained the omissions.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=87 84\u201396].}}</ref> This included statements discussed above in [[#Autobiography on gradually increasing disbelief|Autobiography on gradually increasing disbelief]], and others such as the following:\n\n: \"By further reflecting that the clearest evidence would be requisite to make any sane man believe in the miracles by which Christianity is supported, \u2014 that the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the more incredible, do miracles become, \u2014 that the men at that time were ignorant and credulous to a degree almost incomprehensible by us, \u2014 that the [[Gospels]] cannot be proved to have been written simultaneously with the events, \u2013 that they differ in many important details, far too important as it seemed to me to be admitted as the usual inaccuracies of eyewitness; \u2013 by such reflections as these, which I give not as having the least novelty or value, but as they influenced me, I gradually came to disbelieve in Christianity as a divine revelation. The fact that many false religions have spread over large portions of the earth like wild-fire had some weight with me. Beautiful as is the morality of the [[New Testament]], it can hardly be denied that its perfection depends in part on the interpretation which we now put on metaphors and allegories.\" (p.86)\n\n: \"I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable [[doctrine]].\" (p. 87)\n\n: \"The old argument of design in nature, as given by [[William Paley|Paley]], which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection had been discovered. We can no longer argue that, for instance, the beautiful hinge of a [[bivalve shell]] must have been made by an intelligent being, like the hinge of a door by man. There seems to be no more design in the variability of organic beings and in the action of natural selection, than in the course which the wind blows. Everything in nature is the result of fixed laws.\" (p.87)\n\n: \"At the present day (ca. 1872) the most usual argument for the existence of an intelligent God is drawn from the deep inward conviction and feelings which are experienced by most persons. But it cannot be doubted that [[Hindu|Hindoos]], [[Islam|Mahomadans]] and others might argue in the same manner and with equal force in favor of the existence of one God, or of many Gods, or as with the [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] of no God...This argument would be a valid one if all men of all races had the same inward conviction of the existence of one God: but we know that this is very far from being the case. Therefore I cannot see that such inward convictions and feelings are of any weight as evidence of what really exists.\" (p.91)\n\n==The Lady Hope Story==\nThe \"[[Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope|Lady Hope Story]]\", first published in 1915, claimed that Darwin had reverted to Christianity on his sickbed. The claims were rejected by Darwin's children and have been dismissed as false by historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|2005}}<br/>{{Harvnb|Yates|2003}}</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation\n | last = Aveling\n | first = E.

For most of the game, the two teams took turns intercepting passes and having their passes intercepted. SIUE goalkeeper '''Noah Heim''''s play was outstanding. Among his eight saves were a couple of spectacular ones, including stopping a penalty kick late in the second extra time period.

He and [[Jordan Peele]] were cast against each other, but both ended up being picked after demonstrating great comedic chemistry. Key played many characters on the show. One of his most famous characters is \"Coach Hines\", a high school sports coach who frequently disrupts and threatens students and faculty members. On the penultimate episode of ''Mad TV'', Hines revealed that he is the long-lost heir to the Heinz Ketchup company and only became a Catholic school coach to help delinquent teenagers like Yamanashi ([[Bobby Lee]]). During seasons 9 and 10, Key appeared as \"Dr. Funkenstein\" in blaxploitation parodies, with Peele playing the monster. Key also portrayed various guests on ''Real **********ing Talk'' like the strong African Rollo Johnson and blind victim Stevie Wonder Washington. He often goes \"backstage\" as Eugene Struthers, an ecstatic water-or-flower delivery man who accosts celebrities. There is also \"Jovan Muskatelle\", a shirtless man with a jheri curl and a shower cap. He interrupts live news broadcasts by a reporter (always played by [[Ike Barinholtz]]), annoying him with rapid fire accounts of events that have happened frequently exclaiming \"It was crazy as hell!\" Celebrities that Key impersonated on the show include [[Ludacris]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Roscoe Orman]] (as his character [[Gordon (Sesame Street)|Gordon]] from ''[[Sesame Street]]''), [[Matthew Lillard]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Al Roker]], [[Terrell Owens]], [[Tyler Perry]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Eddie Murphy]] (as his character James \"Thunder\" Early from the movie ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''), [[Sherman Hemsley]] (as his character George Jefferson on ''[[The Jeffersons]]''), [[Charles Barkley]], [[Sendhil Ramamurthy]] (as [[Mohinder Suresh]]), [[Tyson Beckford]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] (originally played by Peele until Peele left the show at the end of season 13), [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Jack Haley]] (as the [[Tin Woodsman|Tin Man]] from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'').

{"title_page": "Interpolation", "text_new": "{{short description|Method for estimating new data within known data points}}\n{{Other uses}}\n\n{{more footnotes|date=October 2016}}\nIn the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[numerical analysis]], '''interpolation''' is a type of [[estimation]], a method of constructing new [[data points]] within the range of a [[discrete set]] of known data points.\n\nIn [[engineering]] and [[science]], one often has a number of data points, obtained by [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] or [[experimentation]], which represent the values of a function for a limited number of values of the [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]]. It is often required to '''interpolate''', i.e., estimate the value of that function for an intermediate value of the independent variable. \n\nA closely related problem is the [[function approximation|approximation]] of a complicated function by a simple function. Suppose the formula for some given function is known, but too complicated to evaluate efficiently. A few data points from the original function can be interpolated to produce a simpler function which is still fairly close to the original. The resulting gain in simplicity may outweigh the loss from interpolation error.\n\n[[File:Splined epitrochoid.svg|300px|thumb|An interpolation of a finite set of points on an [[epitrochoid]]. The points in red are connected by blue interpolated [[spline (mathematics)|spline curves]] deduced only from the red points. The interpolated curves have polynomial formulas much simpler than that of the original epitrochoid curve.]]\n\n==Example==\nThis table gives some values of an unknown function <math>f(x)</math>.\n[[File:Interpolation Data.svg|right|thumb|230px|Plot of the data points as given in the table.]]\n{| cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0\n|width=\"20px\"|\n!

In simple problems, this method is unlikely to be used, as linear interpolation (see below) is almost as easy, but in higher-dimensional [[multivariate interpolation]], this could be a favourable choice for its speed and simplicity.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Linear interpolation===\n[[File:Interpolation example linear.svg|right|thumb|230px|Plot of the data with linear interpolation superimposed]]\n{{Main|Linear interpolation}}\nOne of the simplest methods is [[linear]] interpolation (sometimes known as lerp). Consider the above example of estimating ''f''(2.5). Since 2.5 is midway between 2 and 3, it is reasonable to take ''f''(2.5) midway between ''f''(2) = 0.9093 and ''f''(3) = 0.1411, which yields 0.5252.\n\nGenerally, linear interpolation takes two data points, say (''x''<sub>''a''</sub>,''y''<sub>''a''</sub>) and (''x''<sub>''b''</sub>,''y''<sub>''b''</sub>), and the interpolant is given by:\n:<math> y = y_a + \\left( y_b-y_a \\right) \\frac{x-x_a}{x_b-x_a} \\text{ at the point } \\left( x,y \\right) </math>\n\n\n:<math> \\frac{y-y_a}{y_b-y_a} = \\frac{x-x_a}{x_b-x_a} </math>\n\n\n:<math> \\frac{y-y_a}{x-x_a} = \\frac{y_b-y_a}{x_b-x_a} </math>\n\n\nThis previous equation states that the slope of the new line between <math> (x_a,y_a) </math> and <math> (x,y) </math> is the same as the slope of the line between <math> (x_a,y_a) </math> and <math> (x_b,y_b) </math>\n\nLinear interpolation is quick and easy, but it is not very precise. Another disadvantage is that the interpolant is not [[derivative|differentiable]] at the point ''x''<sub>''k''</sub>.\n\nThe following error estimate shows that linear interpolation is not very precise. Denote the function which we want to interpolate by ''g'', and suppose that ''x'' lies between ''x''<sub>''a''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''b''</sub> and that ''g'' is twice continuously differentiable. Then the linear interpolation error is\n\n:<math> |f(x)-g(x)| \\le C(x_b-x_a)^2 \\quad\\text{where}\\quad C = \\frac18 \\max_{r\\in[x_a,x_b]} |g''(r)|. </math>\n\nIn words, the error is proportional to the square of the distance between the data points. The error in some other methods, including polynomial interpolation and spline interpolation (described below), is proportional to higher powers of the distance between the data points. These methods also produce smoother interpolants.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Polynomial interpolation===\n[[File:Interpolation example polynomial.svg|right|thumb|230px|Plot of the data with polynomial interpolation applied]]\n{{Main|Polynomial interpolation}}\nPolynomial interpolation is a generalization of linear interpolation. Note that the linear interpolant is a [[linear function]]. We now replace this interpolant with a [[polynomial]] of higher [[degree of a polynomial|degree]].\n\nConsider again the problem given above. The following sixth degree polynomial goes through all the seven points:\n:<math> f(x) = -0.0001521 x^6 - 0.003130 x^5 + 0.07321 x^4 - 0.3577 x^3 + 0.2255 x^2 + 0.9038 x. </math>\n<!-- Coefficients are 0, 0.903803333333334, 0.22549749999997, -0.35772291666664, 0.07321458333332, -0.00313041666667, -0.00015208333333. -->\nSubstituting ''x'' = 2.5, we find that ''f''(2.5) = 0.5965.\n\nGenerally, if we have ''n'' data points, there is exactly one polynomial of degree at most ''n''&minus;1 going through all the data points. The interpolation error is proportional to the distance between the data points to the power ''n''. Furthermore, the interpolant is a polynomial and thus infinitely differentiable. So, we see that polynomial interpolation overcomes most of the problems of linear interpolation.\n\nHowever, polynomial interpolation also has some disadvantages. Calculating the interpolating polynomial is computationally expensive (see [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]]) compared to linear interpolation. Furthermore, polynomial interpolation may exhibit oscillatory artifacts, especially at the end points (see [[Runge's phenomenon]]).\n\nPolynomial interpolation can estimate local maxima and minima that are outside the range of the samples, unlike linear interpolation. For example, the interpolant above has a local maximum at ''x'' \u2248 1.566, ''f''(''x'') \u2248 1.003 and a local minimum at ''x'' \u2248 4.708, ''f''(''x'') \u2248 \u22121.003. However, these maxima and minima may exceed the theoretical range of the function\u2014for example, a function that is always positive may have an interpolant with negative values, and whose inverse therefore contains false [[division by zero|vertical asymptotes]].\n\nMore generally, the shape of the resulting curve, especially for very high or low values of the independent variable, may be contrary to commonsense, i.e. to what is known about the experimental system which has generated the data points. These disadvantages can be reduced by using spline interpolation or restricting attention to [[Chebyshev polynomials]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Spline interpolation===\n[[File:Interpolation example spline.svg|right|thumb|230px|Plot of the data with spline interpolation applied]]\n{{Main|Spline interpolation}}\n\nRemember that linear interpolation uses a linear function for each of intervals [''x''<sub>''k''</sub>,''x''<sub>''k+1''</sub>]. Spline interpolation uses low-degree polynomials in each of the intervals, and chooses the polynomial pieces such that they fit smoothly together. The resulting function is called a [[spline (mathematics)|spline]].\n\nFor instance, the [[natural cubic spline]] is [[piecewise]] cubic and twice continuously differentiable. Furthermore, its second derivative is zero at the end points. The natural cubic spline interpolating the points in the table above is given by\n\n: <math> f(x) = \\begin{cases}\n-0.1522 x^3 + 0.9937 x, & \\text{if } x \\in [0,1], \\\\\n-0.01258 x^3 - 0.4189 x^2 + 1.4126 x - 0.1396, & \\text{if } x \\in [1,2], \\\\\n0.1403 x^3 - 1.3359 x^2 + 3.2467 x - 1.3623, & \\text{if } x \\in [2,3], \\\\\n0.1579 x^3 - 1.4945 x^2 + 3.7225 x - 1.8381, & \\text{if } x \\in [3,4], \\\\\n0.05375 x^3 -0.2450 x^2 - 1.2756 x + 4.8259, & \\text{if } x \\in [4,5], \\\\\n-0.1871 x^3 + 3.3673 x^2 - 19.3370 x + 34.9282, & \\text{if } x \\in [5,6].\n\\end{cases} </math>\n\nIn this case we get ''f''(2.5)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5972.\n\nLike polynomial interpolation, spline interpolation incurs a smaller error than linear interpolation and the interpolant is smoother. However, the interpolant is easier to evaluate than the high-degree polynomials used in polynomial interpolation. However, the global nature of the basis functions leads to ill-conditioning. This is completely mitigated by using splines of compact support, such as are implemented in Boost.Math and discussed in Kress.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kress|first1=Rainer|title=Numerical Analysis|url=https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-1-4612-0599-9|year=1998}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Function approximation==\nInterpolation is a common way to approximate functions. Given a function <math>f:[a,b] \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> with a set of points <math>x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n \\in [a, b]</math> one can form a function <math>s: [a,b] \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> such that <math>f(x_i)=s(x_i)</math> for <math>i=1, 2, \\dots, n</math> (that is that <math>s</math> interpolates <math>f</math> at these points). In general, an interpolant need not be a good approximation, but there are well known and often reasonable conditions where it will. For example, if <math>f\\in C^4([a,b])</math> (four times continuously differentiable) then [[spline interpolation|cubic spline interpolation]] has an error bound given by <math>\\|f-s\\|_\\infty \\leq C \\|f^{(4)}\\|_\\infty h^4</math> where <math>h \\max_{i=1,2, \\dots, n-1} |x_{i+1}-x_i|</math> and <math>C</math> is a constant.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Charles A. |last2=Meyer |first2=Weston W. |title=Optimal Error Bounds for Cubic Spline Interpolation |journal=Journal of Approximation Theory |date=1976 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=105\u2013122 |doi=10.1016/0021-9045(76)90040-X }}</ref>\n\n==Via Gaussian processes==\n[[Gaussian process]] is a powerful non-linear interpolation tool. Many popular interpolation tools are actually equivalent to particular Gaussian processes. Gaussian processes can be used not only for fitting an interpolant that passes exactly through the given data points but also for regression, i.e., for fitting a curve through noisy data. In the geostatistics community Gaussian process regression is also known as [[Kriging]].\n\n==Other forms==\nOther forms of interpolation can be constructed by picking a different class of interpolants. For instance, rational interpolation is '''interpolation''' by [[rational function]]s using [[Pad\u00e9 approximant]], and [[trigonometric interpolation]] is interpolation by [[trigonometric polynomial]]s using [[Fourier series]]. Another possibility is to use [[wavelet]]s.\n\nThe [[Whittaker\u2013Shannon interpolation formula]] can be used if the number of data points is infinite or if the function to be interpolated has compact support.\n\nSometimes, we know not only the value of the function that we want to interpolate, at some points, but also its derivative. This leads to [[Hermite interpolation]] problems.\n\nWhen each data point is itself a function, it can be useful to see the interpolation problem as a partial [[advection]] problem between each data point. This idea leads to the [[displacement interpolation]] problem used in [[Transportation theory (mathematics)|transportation theory]].\n\n==In higher dimensions==\n{{comparison_of_1D_and_2D_interpolation.svg|250px|}}\n{{main|Multivariate interpolation}}\nMultivariate interpolation is the interpolation of functions of more than one variable. \nMethods include [[bilinear interpolation]] and [[bicubic interpolation]] in two dimensions, and [[trilinear interpolation]] in three dimensions.\nThey can be applied to gridded or scattered data.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Nearest2DInterpolExample.png|Nearest neighbor\nImage:BilinearInterpolExample.png|Bilinear\nImage:BicubicInterpolationExample.png|Bicubic\n</gallery>\n\n==In digital signal processing==\nIn the domain of digital signal processing, the term interpolation refers to the process of converting a sampled digital signal (such as a sampled audio signal) to that of a higher sampling rate ([[Upsampling]]) using various digital filtering techniques (e.g., convolution with a frequency-limited impulse signal). In this application there is a specific requirement that the harmonic content of the original signal be preserved without creating aliased harmonic content of the original signal above the original Nyquist limit of the signal (i.e., above fs/2 of the original signal sample rate).

It is only required to approach the data points as closely as possible (within some other constraints).  This requires parameterizing the potential interpolants and having some way of measuring the error.  In the simplest case this leads to [[least squares]] approximation.\n\n[[Approximation theory]] studies how to find the best approximation to a given function by another function from some predetermined class, and how good this approximation is. This clearly yields a bound on how well the interpolant can approximate the unknown function.\n\n==Generalization==\nIf we consider <math>x</math> as a variable in a [[topological space]],  and the function <math>f(x)</math> mapping to a [[Banach space]], then the problem is treated as \"interpolation of operators\".<ref>Colin Bennett, Robert C.

A few data points from the original function can be interpolated to produce a simpler function which is still fairly close to the original.

In simple problems, this method is unlikely to be used, as linear interpolation (see below) is almost as easy, but in higher-dimensional [[multivariate interpolation]], this could be a favourable choice for its speed and simplicity.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Linear interpolation===\n[[File:Interpolation example linear.svg|right|thumb|230px|Plot of the data with linear interpolation superimposed]]\n{{Main|Linear interpolation}}\nOne of the simplest methods is [[linear]] interpolation (sometimes known as lerp). Consider the above example of estimating ''f''(2.5). Since 2.5 is midway between 2 and 3, it is reasonable to take ''f''(2.5) midway between ''f''(2) = 0.9093 and ''f''(3) = 0.1411, which yields 0.5252.\n\nGenerally, linear interpolation takes two data points, say (''x''<sub>''a''</sub>,''y''<sub>''a''</sub>) and (''x''<sub>''b''</sub>,''y''<sub>''b''</sub>), and the interpolant is given by:\n:<math> y = y_a + \\left( y_b-y_a \\right) \\frac{x-x_a}{x_b-x_a} \\text{ at the point } \\left( x,y \\right) </math>\n\n\n:<math> \\frac{y-y_a}{y_b-y_a} = \\frac{x-x_a}{x_b-x_a} </math>\n\n\n:<math> \\frac{y-y_a}{x-x_a} = \\frac{y_b-y_a}{x_b-x_a} </math>\n\n\nThis previous equation states that the slope of the new line between <math> (x_a,y_a) </math> and <math> (x,y) </math> is the same as the slope of the line between <math> (x_a,y_a) </math> and <math> (x_b,y_b) </math>\n\nLinear interpolation is quick and easy, but it is not very precise. Another disadvantage is that the interpolant is not [[derivative|differentiable]] at the point ''x''<sub>''k''</sub>.\n\nThe following error estimate shows that linear interpolation is not very precise. Denote the function which we want to interpolate by ''g'', and suppose that ''x'' lies between ''x''<sub>''a''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''b''</sub> and that ''g'' is twice continuously differentiable. Then the linear interpolation error is\n\n:<math> |f(x)-g(x)| \\le C(x_b-x_a)^2 \\quad\\text{where}\\quad C = \\frac18 \\max_{r\\in[x_a,x_b]} |g''(r)|. </math>\n\nIn words, the error is proportional to the square of the distance between the data points. The error in some other methods, including polynomial interpolation and spline interpolation (described below), is proportional to higher powers of the distance between the data points. These methods also produce smoother interpolants.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Polynomial interpolation===\n[[File:Interpolation example polynomial.svg|right|thumb|230px|Plot of the data with polynomial interpolation applied]]\n{{Main|Polynomial interpolation}}\nPolynomial interpolation is a generalization of linear interpolation.
