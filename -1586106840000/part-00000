Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

The fashion for [[beaver hats]] in Europe generated demand for pelts. French trade for beaver in the lower [[Saint Lawrence River]] had led to the depletion of the animals in that region by the late 1630s, so the French searched farther west for new resources and new routes, making alliances with the Native Americans along the way to trap and deliver their furs.\n\n[[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] is credited with the European discovery of Lake Superior before 1620. [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] and [[M\u00e9dard des Groseilliers]] explored the Duluth area, [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] (Bottom of the Lake) in 1654 and again in 1660. The French soon established fur posts near Duluth and in the far north where [[Grand Portage]] became a major trading center. The French explorer [[Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut]], whose name is sometimes anglicized as \"DuLuth\", explored the [[Saint Louis River]] in 1679.\n\nAfter 1792 and the independence of the United States, the [[North West Company]] established several posts on Minnesota rivers and lakes, and in areas to the west and northwest, for trading with the Ojibwe, the [[Dakota (given name)|Dakota]], and other native tribes. The first post was where [[Superior, Wisconsin]], later developed. Known as Fort Saint Louis, the post became the headquarters for North West's new Fond du Lac Department. It had stockaded walls, two houses of 40 feet each, a shed of 60 feet, a large warehouse, and a canoe yard. Over time, Indian peoples and European Americans settled nearby, and a town gradually developed at this point.\n[[File:Old Trading Post on St. Louis River, Duluth, MN.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of old [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] trading post, 1907]]\nIn 1808, the [[American Fur Company]] was organized by German-born [[John Jacob Astor]]. The company began trading at the Head of the Lakes in 1809. In 1817, it erected a new headquarters at present-day [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] on the Saint Louis River. There, portages connected Lake Superior with [[Lake Vermillion]] to the north, and with the [[Mississippi River]] to the south. After creating a powerful monopoly, Astor got out of the business about 1830, as the trade was declining. But active trade was carried on until the failure of the fur trade in the 1840s. European fashions had changed and many American areas were getting over-trapped, with game declining.\n\nIn 1832 [[Henry Schoolcraft]] visited the Fond du Lac area and wrote of his experiences with the Ojibwe Indians there.  Longfellow based the [[Song of Hiawatha]], his epic poem relating the fictional adventures of an Ojibwe warrior named Hiawatha and the tragedy of his love for Minnehaha, a Dakota woman, on Schoolcraft\u2019s writings.<ref>{{cite web |title=An Ethnographic Study of Indigenous Contributions to the City of Duluth |url=http://www.duluthstories.net/downloads/DuluthEthnographicStudy2015.pdf |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nNatives signed two [[Treaty of Fond du Lac|Treaties of Fond du Lac]] with the United States in the present neighborhood of Fond du Lac in 1826 and 1847, in which the Ojibwe ceded land to the American government. As part of the Treaty of Washington (1854) with the [[Lake Superior Band of Chippewa]], the United States set aside the [[Fond du Lac Indian Reservation]] upstream from Duluth near [[Cloquet, Minnesota]].\n\n===Permanent settlement===\n[[File:Minnesota Point.jpg|thumb|Minnesota Point from the hill above Duluth in 1875]]\n\nAs European Americans continued to settle and encroach on Ojibwe lands, the U.S. government made a series of treaties, executed between 1837 and 1889, that expropriated vast areas of tribal lands for their use and relegated the Native American peoples to a number of small reservations.<ref name=\"NRHP\" /> Interest in the area was piqued in the 1850s by rumors of [[copper mining]]. A government land survey in 1852, followed by a treaty with local tribes in 1854, secured wilderness for gold-seeking explorers, sparked a [[land run|land rush]], and led to the development of [[iron ore]] mining in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|title=History of Duluth, Minnesota|access-date=June 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630182218/http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|archive-date=June 30, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, newly constructed [[channel (geography)|channels]] and [[canal lock|locks]] in the East permitted large ships to access the area. A road connecting Duluth to the [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul|Twin Cities]] was also constructed. Eleven small towns on both sides of the [[Saint Louis River]] were formed, establishing Duluth's roots as a city.\n\nBy 1857, copper resources were scarce and the area's economic focus shifted to timber harvesting. A nationwide financial crisis, the [[Panic of 1857]], caused most of the city's early pioneers to leave. A history of Duluth written in 1910 relates, \"Of the handful remaining in 1859 four men were unemployed and one of those was a brewer.  Capital idea; build a brewery. The absence of malt and hops and barley did not at all embarrass those stout-hearted settlers.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Duluth and St. Louis County Past and Present|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DeTGZQETyxIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=true|access-date=July 23, 2017|last1 = Woodbridge|first1 = Dwight Edwards|last2 = Pardee|first2 = John Stone|year = 1910}}</ref> The water for brewing was obtained from a stream that emptied into Lake Superior that came to be called Brewery Creek, as it is still known today. While the brewery \"was not a pecuniary success\", a few decades later it became the [[Fitger Brewing Company]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Fitger's Brewhouse|url=https://fitgersbrewhouse.com/history/|access-date=July 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111033928/http://fitgersbrewhouse.com/history/|archive-date=November 11, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n[[File:Jay Cooke.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of [[Jay Cooke]] by [[Henry Shrady]], located in Jay Cooke Plaza]]\n\nThe opening of the canal at [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] in 1855 and the contemporaneous announcement of the railroads' approach had made Duluth the only port  with access to both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Soon the lumber industry, railroads and mining were all growing so quickly that the influx of workers could hardly keep up with demand, and storefronts popped up almost overnight. By 1868, business in Duluth was booming. In a [[Fourth of July]] speech Dr. Thomas Preston Foster, the founder of Duluth's first newspaper, coined the expression \"The Zenith City of the Unsalted Seas\".\n\nIn 1869\u201370, Duluth was the fastest-growing city in the country and was expected to surpass Chicago in only a few years.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} When [[Jay Cooke]], a wealthy Philadelphia land speculator, convinced the [[Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad]] to create an extension from [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] to Duluth, the railroad opened areas due north and west of Lake Superior to [[iron ore]] mining. Duluth's population on New Year's Day of 1869 consisted of 14 families; by the [[Fourth of July]], 3,500 people were present to celebrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn the first ''Duluth Minnesotian'' printed on August 24, 1869, the editor placed the following notice on the editorial page:\n\n\"Newcomers should comprehend that Duluth is at present a small place, and hotel and boarding room accommodation is extremely limited.

But by the late 1870s, with the continued boom in lumber and mining and with the railroads completed, Duluth bloomed again. By the turn of the century, it had almost 100,000 inhabitants, and was again a thriving community with small-business loans, commerce and trade flowing through the city. Mining continued in the [[Mesabi Range]] and iron was shipped east to mills in Ohio, a trade continuing into the 20th century.\n<br clear='left'/>\n{{wide image|General view from bluffs, Duluth, Minn. c1898.jpg|900px|Panoramic view, {{Circa|1898}}}}\n\n====\"The Untold Delights of Duluth\"====\nEarly doubts about the Duluth area's potential were voiced in \"The Untold Delights of Duluth,\" a speech U.S. Representative [[J.

Although steel production did not begin until 1915, predictions held that Duluth's population would rise to 200,000\u2013300,000. Along with the [[Duluth Works]] steel plant, US Steel developed [[Morgan Park, Duluth, Minnesota|Morgan Park]], as a company town for steel workers. It is now a city neighborhood within Duluth.\n\nThe [[Diamond Calk Horseshoe Company]] was founded in 1908 and later became a major manufacturer and exporter of wrenches and automotive tools. Duluth's huge wholesale Marshall Wells Hardware Company expanded in 1901 by opening branches in [[Portland, Oregon]], and [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]; the company catalog totaled 2,390 pages by 1913. The Duluth Showcase Company, which later became the Duluth Refrigerator Company and then the Coolerator Company, was established in 1908. The Universal Atlas Cement Company, which made cement from the slag byproduct of the steel plant, began operations in 1917.\n\n====Immigration====\nBecause of its numerous jobs in mining and industry, the city was a destination for large waves of immigrants from Europe during the early 20th century.

From 1907 to 1941, the [[Finnish Socialist Federation]] and then the IWW operated [[Work People's College]], an educational institution that taught classes from a working-class, socialist perspective. \nImmigrants from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Ireland, England, Italy, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Ukraine, Romania, and Russia also settled in Duluth.<ref name=\"Port of Duluth\" /> Today, people of Scandinavian descent constitute a strong plurality of Duluth's population, accounting for more than one third of the residents identifying European ancestry.\n\n====Duluth lynchings====\n[[File:Clayton-Jackson-McGhie-memorial-Duluth-Minnesota.jpg|thumb|left|[[Duluth lynchings]] memorial]]\n\nIn September 1918, at the beginning of U.S. involvement in the [[World War I|Great War]], a group calling itself the Knights of Liberty dragged Finnish immigrant [[Olli Kinkkonen]] from his boarding house, tarred and feathered him, and [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] him.

The [[Duluth lynchings]] took place on First Street and Second Avenue East. In the late 20th century, journalist Michael Fedo wrote ''The Lynchings in Duluth'' (1970), which began to raise awareness of the event. Community members from many different groups began to come together for reflection and education.  The men's unmarked graves were located and in 1991, gravestones were erected with funding from a local church. Vigils were held at the intersection where the men were lynched. In 2000, a grassroots committee was formed, and began to offer speakers to groups and schools. It decided to commemorate the event with a memorial. The Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial, which includes a corner wall and plaza, was dedicated in 2003. It includes three {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall bronze statues of the three men.

Many people died on the rural roads surrounding the Duluth area, and historical accounts tell of victims dying while trying to outrun the fire. The ''News Tribune'' reported, \"It is estimated that 100 families were rendered homeless by Saturday's fire in the territory known as the Woodland District...

Handling and export of iron ore, brought in from the Mesabi Range, was integral to the city's economy, as well as to the steel industry in the Midwest, including in manufacturing cities in Ohio.\n\nThe [[Aerial Lift Bridge]] (earlier known as the \"Aerial Bridge\" or \"Aerial Ferry Bridge\") was built in 1905 and at that time was known as the United States' first [[transporter bridge]]\u2014only one other was ever constructed in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |title=shorpy.com, Photo of original bridge showing gondola |access-date=July 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719112205/http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |archive-date=July 19, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1929&ndash;30, the span was converted to a vertical lift bridge (also rather uncommon).  The bridge was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]  in 1973.\n\nIn 1916, after Europe had entered the Great War (World War I), a shipyard was constructed on the Saint Louis River. A new workers neighborhood, today known as Riverside, developed around the large operation. Similar industrial expansions took place during the [[World War II|Second World War]], as Duluth's large harbor and the area's vast natural resources were put to work for the war effort. Tankers and [[submarine chasers]] (usually called \"sub-chasers\") were built at the Riverside shipyard. The population of Duluth continued to grow in the postwar decade and a half, peaking at 107,884 in 1960.\n\n====Economic decline====\n[[File:Duluth canal.jpg|thumb|[[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] with vessel approaching the lift bridge]]\n\nEconomic decline began in the 1950s, when high-grade iron ore ran out on the [[Iron Range]] north of Duluth; ore shipments from the Duluth harbor had been critical to the city's economy. Low-grade ore ([[taconite]]) shipments continued, boosted by new taconite pellet technology, but ore shipments were lower overall.\n\nIn the 1970s the United States experienced a [[steel crisis]], a recession in the global steel market, and like [[Rust Belt|many American cities]] Duluth entered a period of industrial restructuring. In 1981, US Steel closed its [[Duluth Works]] plant, a blow to the city's economy whose effects included the closure of the cement company, which had depended on the steel plant for raw materials (slag). More closures followed in other industries, including [[shipbuilding]] and [[heavy machinery]]. By decade's end, unemployment rates hit 15 percent. The economic downturn was particularly hard on Duluth's West Side, where ethnic Eastern and Southern European workers had lived for decades.\n\nDuring the 1980s, plans were underway to extend [[Interstate 35]] through Duluth and up the [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]], bringing new access to the city. The original plan called for the interstate to run along the shore on an elevated concrete structure, blocking the city's access to Lake Superior. Kent Worley, a local landscape architect, wrote an impassioned letter to then mayor Ben Boo asking that the route be reconsidered.  The [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] agreed to take another look, with Worley consulting. The new plan called for parts of the highway to run through tunnels,  which allowed preservation of Fitger's Brewery, Sir Ben's Tavern, Leif Erickson Park, and Duluth's Rose Garden. Rock used from the interstate project was used to create an extensive new beach along Lake Superior, along which the city's Lakewalk was built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/lifestyle/3320814-construction-duluths-freeway-drips-stories|title=Construction of Duluth's freeway drips with stories|last=Aug 10th 2014 - 12am|first=Mike Creger {{!}}|website=Duluth News Tribune|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n[[File:Horse and carriage-Duluth-2006.jpg|thumb|left|Canal Park Lakewalk carriage ride]]\n\nWith the decline of the city's industrial core, the local economic focus gradually shifted to [[tourism]]. The interstate brought new people into the community. The downtown area was renovated to emphasize its pedestrian character: streets were paved with red brick and [[skywalk]]s and retail shops were added. The city and developers worked with the area's unique architectural character, converting old warehouses along the waterfront into caf\u00e9s, shops, restaurants, and hotels. Combined with the new rock beach and Lakewalk, these changes developed the new [[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] as a trendy tourism-oriented district. Duluth's population, which had declined since 1960, stabilized at around 85,000.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, Duluth has become a regional center for banking, retail shopping, and medical care for northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and northwestern Michigan. It is estimated that more than 8,000 jobs in Duluth are directly related to its two hospitals. Arts and entertainment offerings, as well as year-round recreation and the natural environment, have contributed to expansion of the tourist industry. Some 3.5 million visitors each year contribute more than $400 million to the local economy.\n\n===Craft district gentrification===\n\nMore recently a collection of like-minded businesses in Lincoln Park, an old rundown blue-collar neighborhood with high unemployment and poverty rates, was cultivated by a group of entrepreneurs who have begun rebuilding and revitalizing the area. Since 2014 at least 25 commercial real estate transactions have occurred and 17 businesses have opened, including restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and artist studios.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|title=Craftsmen, backpacks, beer build hope in a needy Duluth neighborhood|last=Kraker|first=Dan|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211342/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|title=The creative economy in Duluth's craft district|last=Staff|first=MPR News|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211333/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width    = 450\n | image1    = Minnesota Point from Incline Railway, Duluth, Minn (NYPL b12647398-67838).tiff\n | caption1      = [[Minnesota Point]] (or Park Point) from Incline Railway, 1907\n | image2    = Duluth-Minnesota-Superior.jpg\n | caption2      = Minnesota Point in 2006\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|87.43|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|67.79|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|19.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=July 2, 2012 }}</ref> It is Minnesota's second-largest city by land area, surpassed only by [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]].

This similarity was most evident before World War II, when Duluth had a network of streetcars and an [[funicular|inclined railroad]], the [[7th Avenue West Incline Railway]], that, like San Francisco's cable cars, climbed a steep hill. The change in elevation is illustrated by Duluth's two airports. The [[weather station]] at Sky Harbor Airport on Park Point has an elevation of 607 feet (185 m), while Duluth International Airport, atop the hill, is 820 feet higher at 1,427 feet (435 m).<ref name=wunderground>{{cite web|title=Duluth, Minnesota|publisher=The Weather Underground, Inc.

The considerable development on the hill has given Duluth many steep streets. Some neighborhoods, such as [[Piedmont Heights (Duluth)|Piedmont Heights]] and [[Bayview Heights (Duluth)|Bayview Heights]], are atop the hill with scenic views of the city. [[Skyline Parkway]] is a scenic roadway that extends from Becks Road above the [[Gary \u2013 New Duluth]] neighborhood near the western end of the city to the [[Lakeside \u2013 Lester Park (Duluth)|Lester Park]] neighborhood on the east side. It crosses nearly Duluth's entire length and affords  views of Lake Superior, the Aerial Lift Bridge, Canal Park, and the many industries that inhabit the largest inland port.\n\nA rapidly developing part of the city is [[Miller Hill Mall]] and the adjacent big-box retailer shopping strip \"over the hill\" along the Miller Trunk Highway corridor. The 2009\u201310 road reconstruction project in Duluth's [[Miller Trunk Corridor|Miller Hill]] area improved movement through the [[U.S. Highway 53]] corridor from Trinity Road to Maple Grove Road. The highway project reconstructed connector roads, intersections, and adjacent roadways.

An intrusion of the Duluth Complex can be seen at [[Enger Tower]], which is built on a knob of exposed gabbro.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |title=An Introduction to the Geology of the North Shore |publisher=Duluth Streams |access-date=June 28, 2015 |author=Miller, Jim |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708182221/http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |archivedate=July 8, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe lava flows formed the conditions for the creation of [[Lake Superior agate]]s. As the lava solidified, gas trapped within the flows formed an [[vesicular texture|amygdaloidal texture]] (literally, rock filled with small vesicles). Later, groundwater transported dissolved minerals through the vesicles depositing concentric bands of fine-grained [[quartz]] called [[chalcedony]].  The color scheme is caused by the concentration of iron present in the groundwater at the time that each new layer was being deposited.  The process went on until the cavity had been completely filled. Over time erosion freed the agates from the solidified lava, which is not as hard as quartz.\n\nThe creation of the Lake Superior basin reflects the erosive power of [[Laurentide Ice Sheet|continental glaciers]] that advanced and retreated over Minnesota several times in the past 2 million years. The mile-thick ice sheets easily eroded the [[sandstone]] that filled the axis of the rift valley, but encountered more resistance from the [[igneous rock]]s forming the flanks of the rift, now the margins of the lake basin. As the last glacier retreated, meltwaters filled the lake to as high as 500 feet above the current level; the Skyline Parkway roughly follows one of the highest levels of the ancient Lake Superior, [[Glacial Lake Duluth]].<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" /> The sandstone that buried the igneous rocks of the rift is exposed near Fond du Lac. At one time a large number of quarries produced the stone, sold as Fond du Lac or Lake Superior [[brownstone]]. It was widely used in Duluth buildings and also shipped to Minneapolis, Chicago, and Milwaukee, where it was also used extensively. The weathered sandstone forms the sandy lake bottom and shores of Park Point.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" />\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Duluth blizzard, December 2007.jpg|thumb|Spring blizzard, March 2007]]\n\nDuluth has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb''), slightly moderated by its proximity to Lake Superior. Winters are long, snowy, and very cold, normally seeing maximum temperatures remaining below {{convert|32|F|C}} on 106 days (the second-most of any city in the contiguous US behind [[International Falls, Minnesota|International Falls]]), falling to or below {{convert|0|\u00b0F}} on 40\u201341 nights and bringing consistent snow cover from late November to late March.<ref name=\"Duluth NOAA\" /> Winter storms that pass south or east of Duluth can often set up easterly or northeasterly flow, which leads to occasional upslope lake-effect snow events that bring a foot (30&nbsp;cm) or more of snow to the city while areas {{convert|50|mi|km}} inland receive considerably less. The average annual snowfall is 81.5 in. The lake steams in the winter when moist, lake-warmed air at the surface rises and cools, losing some of its moisture-carrying capacity.<ref name=\"superior\">{{cite web|url=http://www.superiortrails.com/duluth_1.html|title=Duluth Minnesota Travel - Things to do and see|access-date=June 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628231401/http://www.superiortrails.com/duluth_1.html|archive-date=June 28, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuluth has been called \"The Air-Conditioned City\" because of the summertime cooling effect of Lake Superior.

Temperatures reach or exceed {{convert|90|\u00b0F}} on only 2 days per year, while the city has officially only seen {{convert|100|\u00b0F}} temperatures on 3 days, all during the [[1936 North American heat wave|July 1936 heat wave]], part of the [[Dust Bowl]] years.<ref name=\"Duluth NOAA\" /> The phrase \"cooler by the lake\" can be heard often in weather forecasts during the summer, especially on days when an easterly wind is expected. Great local variations are also common because of the rapid change in elevation between the nearly 900-foot hilltop and shoreside. Often this variation manifests itself as snow at the Miller Hill Mall while rain falls in Canal Park.<ref name=\"superior\" />\n\nThe record low temperature in Duluth is {{convert|-41|\u00b0F}}, set on January 2, 1885, and the record high temperature is {{convert|106|\u00b0F}}, set on July 13, 1936.

However, on August 9, 2012 at around 11 AM, a tornado touched down on Minnesota Point. It had originally started as a waterspout in Superior Bay, two miles from Sky Harbor Airport, but briefly found its way onto the sandbar's shoreline, making it an 'official' tornado. It quickly dissipated, but soon touched down again on Barker's Island, where it again quickly dissipated. It caused no serious damage, as it was a very weak tornado, scoring only EF0 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]. At the time the [[National Weather Service]] reported that it was Duluth's first tornado. Further investigation showed that more than {{rounddown|{{age|format=raw|1958|5|26}}|-1}} years ago, on May 26, 1958, Duluth had a \"miniature tornado\" that collapsed a garage and damaged two area lake cabins. It lasted only five minutes. The ''News-Tribune'' reported a possible twister on July 11, 1935: \"Swirling into the city on the wings of a torrential rain, a miniature tornado struck in the heart of the Gary-New Duluth district shortly before 8 a.m. yesterday, flattening a row of coal sheds (and) a frame garage and causing general damage to trees in the vicinity. The United States weather bureau had no means of officially recording the twister, the high wind having limited itself to the Gary-New Duluth district.\"<ref>[http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/239784/ Duluth News Tribune | Duluth, Minnesota<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref name=\"Pioneer Press\">{{cite news | url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_21309198/duluth-tornado-waterspout-might-not-have-been-first | title=Duluth tornado/waterspout might not have been a first | date=August 14, 2012 | access-date=July 19, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808170417/http://www.twincities.com/ci_21309198/duluth-tornado-waterspout-might-not-have-been-first | archive-date=August 8, 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 80\n|1870= 3131\n|1880= 3483\n|1890= 33115\n|1900= 52969\n|1910= 78466\n|1920= 98917\n|1930= 101453\n|1940= 101065\n|1950= 104511\n|1960= 107312\n|1970= 100578\n|1980= 92811\n|1990= 85493\n|2000= 86918\n|2010= 86265\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=85884\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=May 29, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref><br />2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\" />\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], there were 86,265 people, 35,705 households, and 18,680 families residing in the city.

It is also a major transportation center for the transshipment of coal, taconite, agricultural products, steel, limestone, and cement. In recent years it has seen strong growth in the transshipment of wind turbine components coming and going from manufacturers in both Europe and North Dakota and of oversized industrial machinery manufactured all around the world and destined for the tar sands oil extraction projects in northern Alberta.\n\nDuluth has attracted several new engineering firms including TKDA, Barr Engineering, LHB, [[Enbridge]] and Lake Superior Consulting, as well as new start-ups in various fields, including Loll Designs, an eco-friendly furniture company, and [[microbrewery]] [[Bent Paddle Brewing Company|Bent Paddle]].<ref name=CBSNews/> Women's clothing retail chain [[Maurices]] is also headquartered in Duluth. In 1989, the [[workwear]] and accessories brand [[Duluth Trading Company]] was founded on a [[barge]] in the city's shipping district. The company moved its headquarters to southern Wisconsin in 2000.\n\nDuluth is a center for aquatic biology and aquatic science. The city is home to the EPA's Mid-Continent Ecology Division Laboratory and the [[University of Minnesota\u2013Duluth]]. These institutions have spawned many economically and scientifically important businesses that support Duluth's economy. A short list of these businesses include ERA Laboratories, LimnoLogic, the ASci Corporation, Environmental Consulting and Testing, and [[Ecolab]].\n\nThe city is popular for tourism. Duluth is a convenient base for trips to the scenic [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]] via [[Minnesota State Highway 61|Highway 61]] and to fishing and wilderness destinations in Minnesota's far north, including the [[Superior National Forest]], Lake Vermilion and the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area]]. Tourists also may drive on the [[North Shore Scenic Drive]] to [[Gooseberry Falls State Park]], Baptism Falls (Minnesota's largest waterfall), the vertical cliff of [[Palisade Head]], [[Isle Royale National Park]] (reached via ferry), [[Grand Portage National Monument]] in Grand Portage, and High Falls of the Pigeon River (on the Canada\u2013US border). [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], can be reached by following the highway into Canada along Lake Superior.\n\nIn 2006, a volunteer task force was formed to manage the spiraling retiree health care benefit obligations that were threatening to bankrupt the city.

The building was designed by Minnesota architect [[Clarence H. Johnston Sr.]], with interiors designed by William French. The formal terraced garden and English-style landscape was designed by the [[Charles Wellford Leavitt]] firm of New York. Construction began in 1905 at a cost of $854,000 (about $21 million in today's dollars), and was completed in 1908. Aside from its architectural significance, Glensheen is noteworthy for the murders of [[Elisabeth Congdon]] and her nurse on June 27, 1977. The mansion is open to tours year-round.\n\n====Duluth Children's Museum====\nFounded in 1930, the Duluth Children's Museum in the Lincoln Park neighborhood is the fifth-oldest of its kind in the United States. It features interactive exhibits, educational programs, and opportunities for creative play designed for children, their families and caregivers, and school field trips. The museum also curates an artifact collection of over 25,000 objects drawn from the lives and cultures of people who have resided in the region, particularly American Indians and immigrants.\n\n====Christmas City of the North Parade====\nEach year in November, the Christmas City of the North Parade takes place in Duluth. The parade dates to 1957, when the holiday shopping season ran particularly short. Wanting to extend Christmas shopping days, Bob Rich, who at the time owned the former WDSM-TV, now [[KBJR-TV]], came up with the idea. Since then, the parade has marched through downtown Duluth annually on the Friday night before Thanksgiving. The event has survived pouring rain, snow and frigid cold. Even in years when instruments were too cold to produce music, the bands became choirs, using their voices to entertain the crowd. Recorded by [[Merv Griffin]] in 1962, the \"Christmas City\" song is the parade's signature sound. According to Rich's grandson, the song was written by a local resident and his grandfather asked his friend Griffin, at that time not the well-known TV personality he later became, if he would sing the song and put it to music.<ref>[http://christmascityparade.com/ Christmas City of the North Parade:<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904072214/http://christmascityparade.com/ |date=September 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://christmascityparade.com/2010/11/grandson-of-christmas-city-parade-creator-shares-history/ Grandson of Christmas City Parade Creator Shares History | Christmas City of the North Parade<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902015321/http://christmascityparade.com/2010/11/grandson-of-christmas-city-parade-creator-shares-history/ |date=September 2, 2013}}</ref>\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n====Gichi-Ode' Akiing====\nOff the city's lakewalk, at the former Lake Place Park (also known as Buffalo Tract), is Gichi-Ode' Akiing, Ojibwe for \"''a grand heart place''.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Ceremony Friday to rename Lake Place Park as Gichi-ode\u2019 Akiing|author=News Tribune|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=April 3, 2020|publisher=Duluth News Tribune and Forum Communications Company|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/incoming/1354590-Ceremony-Friday-to-rename-Lake-Place-Park-as-Gichi-ode%E2%80%99-Akiing|newspaper=Duluth News Tribune}}</ref> The attraction was approved by the [[Duluth City Council]] in 2018, and is a memorial to the 1849 petition asking the U.S. government under President [[Millard Fillmore]] to adjust the boundaries of the [[Treaty_of_La_Pointe#1842_Treaty_of_La_Pointe|1842 Treaty of La Pointe]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Duluth renames city park in the Ojibwe language|author=Kraker, Dan|date=June 1, 2019|accessdate=April 3, 2020|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/06/01/duluth-renames-city-park-ojibwe-language|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio}}</ref><ref name=WIHS>{{cite web|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Image/IM1871|title=Symbolic Petition of the Chippewa Chiefs|accessdate=April 4, 2020|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society}}</ref> [[Kechewaishke]], or Chief Buffalo, signed the Treaty a year before his death.<ref name=Justia>{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/113/435/|title=Prentice v.

Wearing a thick neoprene wetsuit, or perhaps two, surfers gather at Stoney Point, a rocky bay about 15 miles north of Duluth, where waves as high as 15 feet can be expected. In a 2013 broadcast, [[Minnesota Public Radio]] featured a segment on Duluth/Lake Superior surfing, and surfer Mark Anderson from St. Paul described the Duluth surfing experience as \"...{{nbsp}}standing in the snow, jumping off of an ice-covered rock into Lake Superior to go catch waves that any surfer anywhere in the world, pro or beginner, would envy.\" Erik Wilkie, a surfer originally from California interviewed by MPR, remarked that while Lake Superior surfing may look easy, it can be dangerous. \"There's the ice-cold freshwater, which is not as buoyant as saltwater. Lake waves also appear every five seconds or so, much faster than those in the ocean. If you take off on the first or second wave and you wipe out, then you've got four, five, six, eight waves coming right behind you to smash you in the head before you can get back on your board and swim out of there to safety.\" Like surfers everywhere, Duluth surfers notify fellow surfers when the waves are up.

All of the stores were located within the interior of the mall with some shops being accessible from both inside and out. The first floor had a pharmacy and a department store with groceries, a butcher shop, clothing, hardware, furniture, and a general store. The second floor had a bank, dentist office, barber shop, hair salon, hat shop, billiard room, and auditorium.

But Charles Watson Townsend's 1936 ''New York Times'' obituary claimed that he was the inventor, and a controversy developed. A ''St. Paul Pioneer Press'' reporter read Townsend's obituary and realized that the ''Times'' had incorrectly attributed the invention to Townsend. Wanting to set the record straight, on May 23, 1936, the ''Pioneer Press'' ran a story about how the dessert was really invented at a Superior Street restaurant in Duluth in the 1880s, and indicated that the restaurant served ice cream with blueberry pie specifically. This was over a decade before Townsend first ordered pie with ice cream in New York, making Duluth the true birthplace of pie \u00e0 la Mode.<ref>''The New York Times'', May 21, 1936, pg.23, Charles W.

A [[Duluth pack]] is a traditional [[portage]] pack used in canoe travel. A specialized type of backpack, Duluth packs are nearly square in order to fit easily in the bottom of a canoe. The Duluth pack has its roots in a French-Canadian named Camille Poirier. Arriving in Duluth in 1870 with a small stock of leather and tools, he began a shoe store and quickly made a go of it in what was then a booming frontier town on the shores of Lake Superior. Out of his small shoe shop on the waterfront, Poirier began building a new style [[canoe pack]] with a [[tumpline]], sternum strap, and umbrella holder. Patented by Poirer in 1882, the original #3 Duluth Packs have changed little since they were first introduced. He sold the backpack business to the company that now does business as Duluth Pack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityhistory.us/duluth/stories/duluth_pack.htm|title=Duluth Pack - Autobiography of Camille Poirier|first=Sheldon|last=Aubut|access-date=March 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614153146/http://www.cityhistory.us/duluth/stories/duluth_pack.htm|archive-date=June 14, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Chun King, Jeno's Pizza Rolls, and Bellisio Frozen Foods===\n\n{{Main|Chun King|Pizza Rolls|Bellisio Foods}}\n\nDuluth was the home of food magnate [[Jeno Paulucci]]. While working as a wholesale grocer in Hibbing in the late 1940s, Paulucci noticed a growing market for prepared Chinese food. Borrowing $2,500 from a friend, he started canning chow mein \"seasoned to [his] own Italian taste\", and selling it to retailers under the label [[Chun King]]. Chun King came to encompass an entire line of prepared Chinese food; at that time not available in grocery stores. In 1966, he sold his enterprise for $63 million. In 1968, Paulucci founded [[Totino's|Jeno's Inc.]], a company that sold frozen pizzas and a variety of other \"Italian\" foods. The most notable of these was undoubtedly his own invention, the [[pizza roll]], a snack food consisting of an Italian filling wrapped in an egg roll wrapper. He sold Jeno's Inc. for $135 million in 1985. In the 1990s, he started [[Bellisio Foods]], a leading diversified frozen food company named after Paulucci's familial home in Italy, Bellisio Solfare.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/jeno-paulucci-a-pioneer-of-ready-made-ethnic-foods-dies-at-93.html?_r=1& | work=The New York Times | first=Daniel E. | last=Slotnik | title=Jeno Paulucci, a Pioneer of Ready-Made Ethnic Foods, Dies at 93 | date=November 25, 2011 | access-date=February 21, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301201314/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/jeno-paulucci-a-pioneer-of-ready-made-ethnic-foods-dies-at-93.html?_r=1& | archive-date=March 1, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Electric elevator===\n\nIn 1887, inventor [[Alexander Miles]] of Duluth patented an electric [[elevator]].

The fashion for [[beaver hats]] in Europe generated demand for pelts. French trade for beaver in the lower [[Saint Lawrence River]] had led to the depletion of the animals in that region by the late 1630s, so the French searched farther west for new resources and new routes, making alliances with the Native Americans along the way to trap and deliver their furs.\n\n[[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] is credited with the European discovery of Lake Superior before 1620. [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] and [[M\u00e9dard des Groseilliers]] explored the Duluth area, [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] (Bottom of the Lake) in 1654 and again in 1660. The French soon established fur posts near Duluth and in the far north where [[Grand Portage]] became a major trading center. The French explorer [[Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut]], whose name is sometimes anglicized as \"DuLuth\", explored the [[Saint Louis River]] in 1679.\n\nAfter 1792 and the independence of the United States, the [[North West Company]] established several posts on Minnesota rivers and lakes, and in areas to the west and northwest, for trading with the Ojibwe, the [[Dakota (given name)|Dakota]], and other native tribes. The first post was where [[Superior, Wisconsin]], later developed. Known as Fort Saint Louis, the post became the headquarters for North West's new Fond du Lac Department. It had stockaded walls, two houses of 40 feet each, a shed of 60 feet, a large warehouse, and a canoe yard. Over time, Indian peoples and European Americans settled nearby, and a town gradually developed at this point.\n[[File:Old Trading Post on St. Louis River, Duluth, MN.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of old [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] trading post, 1907]]\nIn 1808, the [[American Fur Company]] was organized by German-born [[John Jacob Astor]]. The company began trading at the Head of the Lakes in 1809. In 1817, it erected a new headquarters at present-day [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] on the Saint Louis River. There, portages connected Lake Superior with [[Lake Vermillion]] to the north, and with the [[Mississippi River]] to the south. After creating a powerful monopoly, Astor got out of the business about 1830, as the trade was declining. But active trade was carried on until the failure of the fur trade in the 1840s. European fashions had changed and many American areas were getting over-trapped, with game declining.\n\nIn 1832 [[Henry Schoolcraft]] visited the Fond du Lac area and wrote of his experiences with the Ojibwe Indians there.  Longfellow based the [[Song of Hiawatha]], his epic poem relating the fictional adventures of an Ojibwe warrior named Hiawatha and the tragedy of his love for Minnehaha, a Dakota woman, on Schoolcraft\u2019s writings.<ref>{{cite web |title=An Ethnographic Study of Indigenous Contributions to the City of Duluth |url=http://www.duluthstories.net/downloads/DuluthEthnographicStudy2015.pdf |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nNatives signed two [[Treaty of Fond du Lac|Treaties of Fond du Lac]] with the United States in the present neighborhood of Fond du Lac in 1826 and 1847, in which the Ojibwe ceded land to the American government. As part of the Treaty of Washington (1854) with the [[Lake Superior Band of Chippewa]], the United States set aside the [[Fond du Lac Indian Reservation]] upstream from Duluth near [[Cloquet, Minnesota]].\n\n===Permanent settlement===\n[[File:Minnesota Point.jpg|thumb|Minnesota Point from the hill above Duluth in 1875]]\n\nAs European Americans continued to settle and encroach on Ojibwe lands, the U.S. government made a series of treaties, executed between 1837 and 1889, that expropriated vast areas of tribal lands for their use and relegated the Native American peoples to a number of small reservations.<ref name=\"NRHP\" /> Interest in the area was piqued in the 1850s by rumors of [[copper mining]]. A government land survey in 1852, followed by a treaty with local tribes in 1854, secured wilderness for gold-seeking explorers, sparked a [[land run|land rush]], and led to the development of [[iron ore]] mining in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|title=History of Duluth, Minnesota|access-date=June 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630182218/http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|archive-date=June 30, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, newly constructed [[channel (geography)|channels]] and [[canal lock|locks]] in the East permitted large ships to access the area. A road connecting Duluth to the [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul|Twin Cities]] was also constructed. Eleven small towns on both sides of the [[Saint Louis River]] were formed, establishing Duluth's roots as a city.\n\nBy 1857, copper resources were scarce and the area's economic focus shifted to timber harvesting. A nationwide financial crisis, the [[Panic of 1857]], caused most of the city's early pioneers to leave. A history of Duluth written in 1910 relates, \"Of the handful remaining in 1859 four men were unemployed and one of those was a brewer.  Capital idea; build a brewery. The absence of malt and hops and barley did not at all embarrass those stout-hearted settlers.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Duluth and St. Louis County Past and Present|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DeTGZQETyxIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=true|access-date=July 23, 2017|last1 = Woodbridge|first1 = Dwight Edwards|last2 = Pardee|first2 = John Stone|year = 1910}}</ref> The water for brewing was obtained from a stream that emptied into Lake Superior that came to be called Brewery Creek, as it is still known today.

Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] in 1855 and the contemporaneous announcement of the railroads' approach had made Duluth the only port  with access to both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Soon the lumber industry, railroads and mining were all growing so quickly that the influx of workers could hardly keep up with demand, and storefronts popped up almost overnight. By 1868, business in Duluth was booming. In a [[Fourth of July]] speech Dr. Thomas Preston Foster, the founder of Duluth's first newspaper, coined the expression \"The Zenith City of the Unsalted Seas\".\n\nIn 1869\u201370, Duluth was the fastest-growing city in the country and was expected to surpass Chicago in only a few years.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} When [[Jay Cooke]], a wealthy Philadelphia land speculator, convinced the [[Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad]] to create an extension from [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] to Duluth, the railroad opened areas due north and west of Lake Superior to [[iron ore]] mining. Duluth's population on New Year's Day of 1869 consisted of 14 families; by the [[Fourth of July]], 3,500 people were present to celebrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn the first ''Duluth Minnesotian'' printed on August 24, 1869, the editor placed the following notice on the editorial page:\n\n\"Newcomers should comprehend that Duluth is at present a small place, and hotel and boarding room accommodation is extremely limited.

But by the late 1870s, with the continued boom in lumber and mining and with the railroads completed, Duluth bloomed again. By the turn of the century, it had almost 100,000 inhabitants, and was again a thriving community with small-business loans, commerce and trade flowing through the city. Mining continued in the [[Mesabi Range]] and iron was shipped east to mills in Ohio, a trade continuing into the 20th century.\n\n{{wide image|General view from bluffs, Duluth, Minn. c1898.jpg|900px|Panoramic view, {{Circa|1898}}}}\n\n====\"The Untold Delights of Duluth\"====\nEarly doubts about the Duluth area's potential were voiced in \"The Untold Delights of Duluth,\" a speech U.S. Representative [[J.

His speech opposing the St. Croix and Superior Land Grant lampooned Western [[boosterism]], portraying Duluth as an Eden in fantastically florid terms.

Along with the [[Duluth Works]] steel plant, US Steel developed [[Morgan Park, Duluth, Minnesota|Morgan Park]], as a company town for steel workers. It is now a city neighborhood within Duluth.\n\nThe [[Diamond Calk Horseshoe Company]] was founded in 1908 and later became a major manufacturer and exporter of wrenches and automotive tools.

The [[Duluth lynchings]] took place on First Street and Second Avenue East. In the late 20th century, journalist Michael Fedo wrote ''The Lynchings in Duluth'' (1970), which began to raise awareness of the event. Community members from many different groups began to come together for reflection and education.  The men's unmarked graves were located and in 1991, gravestones were erected with funding from a local church. Vigils were held at the intersection where the men were lynched. In 2000, a grassroots committee was formed, and began to offer speakers to groups and schools. It decided to commemorate the event with a memorial. The Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial, which includes a corner wall and plaza, was dedicated in 2003. It includes three {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall bronze statues of the three men.

The fire was the worst natural disaster in Minnesota history in terms of the number of lives lost in a single day. Many people died on the rural roads surrounding the Duluth area, and historical accounts tell of victims dying while trying to outrun the fire. The ''News Tribune'' reported, \"It is estimated that 100 families were rendered homeless by Saturday's fire in the territory known as the Woodland District...

Handling and export of iron ore, brought in from the Mesabi Range, was integral to the city's economy, as well as to the steel industry in the Midwest, including in manufacturing cities in Ohio.\n\nThe [[Aerial Lift Bridge]] (earlier known as the \"Aerial Bridge\" or \"Aerial Ferry Bridge\") was built in 1905 and at that time was known as the United States' first [[transporter bridge]]\u2014only one other was ever constructed in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |title=shorpy.com, Photo of original bridge showing gondola |access-date=July 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719112205/http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |archive-date=July 19, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1929&ndash;30, the span was converted to a vertical lift bridge (also rather uncommon).  The bridge was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]  in 1973.\n\nIn 1916, after Europe had entered the Great War (World War I), a shipyard was constructed on the Saint Louis River. A new workers neighborhood, today known as Riverside, developed around the large operation. Similar industrial expansions took place during the [[World War II|Second World War]], as Duluth's large harbor and the area's vast natural resources were put to work for the war effort. Tankers and [[submarine chasers]] (usually called \"sub-chasers\") were built at the Riverside shipyard. The population of Duluth continued to grow in the postwar decade and a half, peaking at 107,884 in 1960.\n\n====Economic decline====\n[[File:Duluth canal.jpg|thumb|[[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] with vessel approaching the lift bridge]]\n\nEconomic decline began in the 1950s, when high-grade iron ore ran out on the [[Iron Range]] north of Duluth; ore shipments from the Duluth harbor had been critical to the city's economy. Low-grade ore ([[taconite]]) shipments continued, boosted by new taconite pellet technology, but ore shipments were lower overall.\n\nIn the 1970s the United States experienced a [[steel crisis]], a recession in the global steel market, and like [[Rust Belt|many American cities]] Duluth entered a period of industrial restructuring. In 1981, US Steel closed its [[Duluth Works]] plant, a blow to the city's economy whose effects included the closure of the cement company, which had depended on the steel plant for raw materials (slag). More closures followed in other industries, including [[shipbuilding]] and [[heavy machinery]]. By decade's end, unemployment rates hit 15 percent. The economic downturn was particularly hard on Duluth's West Side, where ethnic Eastern and Southern European workers had lived for decades.\n\nDuring the 1980s, plans were underway to extend [[Interstate 35]] through Duluth and up the [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]], bringing new access to the city. The original plan called for the interstate to run along the shore on an elevated concrete structure, blocking the city's access to Lake Superior. Kent Worley, a local landscape architect, wrote an impassioned letter to then mayor Ben Boo asking that the route be reconsidered.  The [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] agreed to take another look, with Worley consulting. The new plan called for parts of the highway to run through tunnels,  which allowed preservation of Fitger's Brewery, Sir Ben's Tavern, Leif Erickson Park, and Duluth's Rose Garden. Rock used from the interstate project was used to create an extensive new beach along Lake Superior, along which the city's Lakewalk was built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/lifestyle/3320814-construction-duluths-freeway-drips-stories|title=Construction of Duluth's freeway drips with stories|last=Aug 10th 2014 - 12am|first=Mike Creger {{!}}|website=Duluth News Tribune|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n[[File:Horse and carriage-Duluth-2006.jpg|thumb|left|Canal Park Lakewalk carriage ride]]\n\nWith the decline of the city's industrial core, the local economic focus gradually shifted to [[tourism]]. The interstate brought new people into the community. The downtown area was renovated to emphasize its pedestrian character: streets were paved with red brick and [[skywalk]]s and retail shops were added. The city and developers worked with the area's unique architectural character, converting old warehouses along the waterfront into caf\u00e9s, shops, restaurants, and hotels. Combined with the new rock beach and Lakewalk, these changes developed the new [[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] as a trendy tourism-oriented district. Duluth's population, which had declined since 1960, stabilized at around 85,000.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, Duluth has become a regional center for banking, retail shopping, and medical care for northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and northwestern Michigan. It is estimated that more than 8,000 jobs in Duluth are directly related to its two hospitals. Arts and entertainment offerings, as well as year-round recreation and the natural environment, have contributed to expansion of the tourist industry. Some 3.5 million visitors each year contribute more than $400 million to the local economy.\n\n===Craft district gentrification===\n\nMore recently a collection of like-minded businesses in Lincoln Park, an old rundown blue-collar neighborhood with high unemployment and poverty rates, was cultivated by a group of entrepreneurs who have begun rebuilding and revitalizing the area. Since 2014 at least 25 commercial real estate transactions have occurred and 17 businesses have opened, including restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and artist studios.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|title=Craftsmen, backpacks, beer build hope in a needy Duluth neighborhood|last=Kraker|first=Dan|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211342/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|title=The creative economy in Duluth's craft district|last=Staff|first=MPR News|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211333/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width    = 450\n | image1    = Minnesota Point from Incline Railway, Duluth, Minn (NYPL b12647398-67838).tiff\n | caption1      = [[Minnesota Point]] (or Park Point) from Incline Railway, 1907\n | image2    = Duluth-Minnesota-Superior.jpg\n | caption2      = Minnesota Point in 2006\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|87.43|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|67.79|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|19.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=July 2, 2012 }}</ref> It is Minnesota's second-largest city by land area, surpassed only by [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]].

Duluth has been called \"the San Francisco of the Midwest,\" alluding to [[San Francisco]]'s similar water-to-hilltop topography. This similarity was most evident before World War II, when Duluth had a network of streetcars and an [[funicular|inclined railroad]], the [[7th Avenue West Incline Railway]], that, like San Francisco's cable cars, climbed a steep hill. The change in elevation is illustrated by Duluth's two airports. The [[weather station]] at Sky Harbor Airport on Park Point has an elevation of 607 feet (185 m), while Duluth International Airport, atop the hill, is 820 feet higher at 1,427 feet (435 m).<ref name=wunderground>{{cite web|title=Duluth, Minnesota|publisher=The Weather Underground, Inc.

Duluth and Lake Superior coast are visible at far left]]\nEven as the city has grown, its populace has tended to hug Lake Superior's shoreline, so Duluth is primarily a southwest\u2013northeast city. The considerable development on the hill has given Duluth many steep streets. Some neighborhoods, such as [[Piedmont Heights (Duluth)|Piedmont Heights]] and [[Bayview Heights (Duluth)|Bayview Heights]], are atop the hill with scenic views of the city. [[Skyline Parkway]] is a scenic roadway that extends from Becks Road above the [[Gary \u2013 New Duluth]] neighborhood near the western end of the city to the [[Lakeside \u2013 Lester Park (Duluth)|Lester Park]] neighborhood on the east side. It crosses nearly Duluth's entire length and affords  views of Lake Superior, the Aerial Lift Bridge, Canal Park, and the many industries that inhabit the largest inland port.\n\nA rapidly developing part of the city is [[Miller Hill Mall]] and the adjacent big-box retailer shopping strip \"over the hill\" along the Miller Trunk Highway corridor. The 2009\u201310 road reconstruction project in Duluth's [[Miller Trunk Corridor|Miller Hill]] area improved movement through the [[U.S. Highway 53]] corridor from Trinity Road to Maple Grove Road. The highway project reconstructed connector roads, intersections, and adjacent roadways. A new international airport terminal was completed in 2013 as part of the federal government's Stimulus Reconstruction Program.\n\n===Geological history===\n[[File:Large anorthosite xenolith in ophitic ilmenite gabbro (anorthosite series, Duluth Complex, Mesoproterozoic, 1099 Ma; Keene Creek East Skyline Parkway roadcut, Duluth, Minnesota, USA) 1 (22039818790).jpg|thumb|Large [[anorthosite]] [[xenolith]] in ophitic ilmenite gabbro, Duluth Complex, Keene Creek East Skyline Parkway roadcut, Duluth, Minnesota]]\n[[File:Agat Lake Superior - Duluth, Minnesota, USA..jpg|thumb|[[Lake Superior agate]] - Duluth, Minnesota]]\n\nThe geology of Duluth demonstrates the [[Midcontinent Rift]], formed as the North American continent began to split apart about 1.1 billion years ago. As the [[Mantle (geology)|earth's crust]] thinned, [[magma]] rose toward the surface. These intrusions formed a {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}}-thick [[Sill (geology)|sill]], primarily of [[gabbro]], which is known as the [[Duluth Complex]]. An intrusion of the Duluth Complex can be seen at [[Enger Tower]], which is built on a knob of exposed gabbro.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |title=An Introduction to the Geology of the North Shore |publisher=Duluth Streams |access-date=June 28, 2015 |author=Miller, Jim |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708182221/http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |archivedate=July 8, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe lava flows formed the conditions for the creation of [[Lake Superior agate]]s. As the lava solidified, gas trapped within the flows formed an [[vesicular texture|amygdaloidal texture]] (literally, rock filled with small vesicles). Later, groundwater transported dissolved minerals through the vesicles depositing concentric bands of fine-grained [[quartz]] called [[chalcedony]].  The color scheme is caused by the concentration of iron present in the groundwater at the time that each new layer was being deposited.  The process went on until the cavity had been completely filled. Over time erosion freed the agates from the solidified lava, which is not as hard as quartz.\n\nThe creation of the Lake Superior basin reflects the erosive power of [[Laurentide Ice Sheet|continental glaciers]] that advanced and retreated over Minnesota several times in the past 2 million years. The mile-thick ice sheets easily eroded the [[sandstone]] that filled the axis of the rift valley, but encountered more resistance from the [[igneous rock]]s forming the flanks of the rift, now the margins of the lake basin. As the last glacier retreated, meltwaters filled the lake to as high as 500 feet above the current level; the Skyline Parkway roughly follows one of the highest levels of the ancient Lake Superior, [[Glacial Lake Duluth]].<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" /> The sandstone that buried the igneous rocks of the rift is exposed near Fond du Lac. At one time a large number of quarries produced the stone, sold as Fond du Lac or Lake Superior [[brownstone]]. It was widely used in Duluth buildings and also shipped to Minneapolis, Chicago, and Milwaukee, where it was also used extensively. The weathered sandstone forms the sandy lake bottom and shores of Park Point.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" />\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Duluth blizzard, December 2007.jpg|thumb|Spring blizzard, March 2007]]\n\nDuluth has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb''), slightly moderated by its proximity to Lake Superior.

However, on August 9, 2012 at around 11 AM, a tornado touched down on Minnesota Point. It had originally started as a waterspout in Superior Bay, two miles from Sky Harbor Airport, but briefly found its way onto the sandbar's shoreline, making it an 'official' tornado. It quickly dissipated, but soon touched down again on Barker's Island, where it again quickly dissipated. It caused no serious damage, as it was a very weak tornado, scoring only EF0 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]. At the time the [[National Weather Service]] reported that it was Duluth's first tornado. Further investigation showed that more than {{rounddown|{{age|format=raw|1958|5|26}}|-1}} years ago, on May 26, 1958, Duluth had a \"miniature tornado\" that collapsed a garage and damaged two area lake cabins. It lasted only five minutes. The ''News-Tribune'' reported a possible twister on July 11, 1935: \"Swirling into the city on the wings of a torrential rain, a miniature tornado struck in the heart of the Gary-New Duluth district shortly before 8 a.m. yesterday, flattening a row of coal sheds (and) a frame garage and causing general damage to trees in the vicinity. The United States weather bureau had no means of officially recording the twister, the high wind having limited itself to the Gary-New Duluth district.\"<ref>[http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/239784/ Duluth News Tribune | Duluth, Minnesota<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref name=\"Pioneer Press\">{{cite news | url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_21309198/duluth-tornado-waterspout-might-not-have-been-first | title=Duluth tornado/waterspout might not have been a first | date=August 14, 2012 | access-date=July 19, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808170417/http://www.twincities.com/ci_21309198/duluth-tornado-waterspout-might-not-have-been-first | archive-date=August 8, 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 80\n|1870= 3131\n|1880= 3483\n|1890= 33115\n|1900= 52969\n|1910= 78466\n|1920= 98917\n|1930= 101453\n|1940= 101065\n|1950= 104511\n|1960= 107312\n|1970= 100578\n|1980= 92811\n|1990= 85493\n|2000= 86918\n|2010= 86265\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=85884\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=May 29, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref><br />2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\" />\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], there were 86,265 people, 35,705 households, and 18,680 families residing in the city.

It is also a major transportation center for the transshipment of coal, taconite, agricultural products, steel, limestone, and cement. In recent years it has seen strong growth in the transshipment of wind turbine components coming and going from manufacturers in both Europe and North Dakota and of oversized industrial machinery manufactured all around the world and destined for the tar sands oil extraction projects in northern Alberta.\n\nDuluth has attracted several new engineering firms including TKDA, Barr Engineering, LHB, [[Enbridge]] and Lake Superior Consulting, as well as new start-ups in various fields, including Loll Designs, an eco-friendly furniture company, and [[microbrewery]] [[Bent Paddle Brewing Company|Bent Paddle]].<ref name=CBSNews/> Women's clothing retail chain [[Maurices]] is also headquartered in Duluth. In 1989, the [[workwear]] and accessories brand [[Duluth Trading Company]] was founded on a [[barge]] in the city's shipping district. The company moved its headquarters to southern Wisconsin in 2000.\n\nDuluth is a center for aquatic biology and aquatic science. The city is home to the EPA's Mid-Continent Ecology Division Laboratory and the [[University of Minnesota\u2013Duluth]]. These institutions have spawned many economically and scientifically important businesses that support Duluth's economy. A short list of these businesses include ERA Laboratories, LimnoLogic, the ASci Corporation, Environmental Consulting and Testing, and [[Ecolab]].\n\nThe city is popular for tourism. Duluth is a convenient base for trips to the scenic [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]] via [[Minnesota State Highway 61|Highway 61]] and to fishing and wilderness destinations in Minnesota's far north, including the [[Superior National Forest]], Lake Vermilion and the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area]]. Tourists also may drive on the [[North Shore Scenic Drive]] to [[Gooseberry Falls State Park]], Baptism Falls (Minnesota's largest waterfall), the vertical cliff of [[Palisade Head]], [[Isle Royale National Park]] (reached via ferry), [[Grand Portage National Monument]] in Grand Portage, and High Falls of the Pigeon River (on the Canada\u2013US border). [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], can be reached by following the highway into Canada along Lake Superior.\n\nIn 2006, a volunteer task force was formed to manage the spiraling retiree health care benefit obligations that were threatening to bankrupt the city.

Not a commercial success, the flights ended later that summer when the designer of the aircraft's engine crashed it. After being purchased and used for scheduled flights in Florida, the plane returned to Duluth and other locations for passenger flights in 1914, until it was ultimately damaged in a hard landing later that year in California and pronounced unsalvageable.

It is largely a conversion of an old [[warehouse district]] into restaurants, caf\u00e9s, hotels, and shops, especially those dealing in antiques and other novelties. This conversion began in the 1980s as an attempt to use Duluth's rich [[industry|industrial]] past, the decline of which had left the city in economic turmoil. A 4.2-mile lakewalk cuts through the area, offering a view of Park Point's extensive sandy dunes and beaches. Swimming is an option, though few are willing to swim in Lake Superior's icy waters.

The parade dates to 1957, when the holiday shopping season ran particularly short. Wanting to extend Christmas shopping days, Bob Rich, who at the time owned the former WDSM-TV, now [[KBJR-TV]], came up with the idea. Since then, the parade has marched through downtown Duluth annually on the Friday night before Thanksgiving. The event has survived pouring rain, snow and frigid cold. Even in years when instruments were too cold to produce music, the bands became choirs, using their voices to entertain the crowd. Recorded by [[Merv Griffin]] in 1962, the \"Christmas City\" song is the parade's signature sound. According to Rich's grandson, the song was written by a local resident and his grandfather asked his friend Griffin, at that time not the well-known TV personality he later became, if he would sing the song and put it to music.<ref>[http://christmascityparade.com/ Christmas City of the North Parade:<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904072214/http://christmascityparade.com/ |date=September 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://christmascityparade.com/2010/11/grandson-of-christmas-city-parade-creator-shares-history/ Grandson of Christmas City Parade Creator Shares History | Christmas City of the North Parade<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902015321/http://christmascityparade.com/2010/11/grandson-of-christmas-city-parade-creator-shares-history/ |date=September 2, 2013}}</ref>\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n====Gichi-Ode' Akiing====\nOff the city's lakewalk, at the former Lake Place Park (also known as Buffalo Tract), is Gichi-Ode' Akiing, Ojibwe for \"''a grand heart place''.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Ceremony Friday to rename Lake Place Park as Gichi-ode\u2019 Akiing|author=News Tribune|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=April 3, 2020|publisher=Duluth News Tribune and Forum Communications Company|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/incoming/1354590-Ceremony-Friday-to-rename-Lake-Place-Park-as-Gichi-ode%E2%80%99-Akiing|newspaper=Duluth News Tribune}}</ref> The attraction was approved by the [[Duluth City Council]] in 2018, and is a memorial to the 1849 petition asking the U.S. government under President [[Millard Fillmore]] to adjust the boundaries of the [[Treaty_of_La_Pointe#1842_Treaty_of_La_Pointe|1842 Treaty of La Pointe]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Duluth renames city park in the Ojibwe language|author=Kraker, Dan|date=June 1, 2019|accessdate=April 3, 2020|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/06/01/duluth-renames-city-park-ojibwe-language|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio}}</ref><ref name=WIHS>{{cite web|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Image/IM1871|title=Symbolic Petition of the Chippewa Chiefs|accessdate=April 4, 2020|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society}}</ref> [[Kechewaishke]], or Chief Buffalo, signed the Treaty a year before his death.<ref name=Justia>{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/113/435/|title=Prentice v.

Wearing a thick neoprene wetsuit, or perhaps two, surfers gather at Stoney Point, a rocky bay about 15 miles north of Duluth, where waves as high as 15 feet can be expected. In a 2013 broadcast, [[Minnesota Public Radio]] featured a segment on Duluth/Lake Superior surfing, and surfer Mark Anderson from St. Paul described the Duluth surfing experience as \"...{{nbsp}}standing in the snow, jumping off of an ice-covered rock into Lake Superior to go catch waves that any surfer anywhere in the world, pro or beginner, would envy.\" Erik Wilkie, a surfer originally from California interviewed by MPR, remarked that while Lake Superior surfing may look easy, it can be dangerous. \"There's the ice-cold freshwater, which is not as buoyant as saltwater. Lake waves also appear every five seconds or so, much faster than those in the ocean. If you take off on the first or second wave and you wipe out, then you've got four, five, six, eight waves coming right behind you to smash you in the head before you can get back on your board and swim out of there to safety.\" Like surfers everywhere, Duluth surfers notify fellow surfers when the waves are up.

Out of his small shoe shop on the waterfront, Poirier began building a new style [[canoe pack]] with a [[tumpline]], sternum strap, and umbrella holder. Patented by Poirer in 1882, the original #3 Duluth Packs have changed little since they were first introduced. He sold the backpack business to the company that now does business as Duluth Pack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityhistory.us/duluth/stories/duluth_pack.htm|title=Duluth Pack - Autobiography of Camille Poirier|first=Sheldon|last=Aubut|access-date=March 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614153146/http://www.cityhistory.us/duluth/stories/duluth_pack.htm|archive-date=June 14, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Chun King, Jeno's Pizza Rolls, and Bellisio Frozen Foods===\n\n{{Main|Chun King|Pizza Rolls|Bellisio Foods}}\n\nDuluth was the home of food magnate [[Jeno Paulucci]]. While working as a wholesale grocer in Hibbing in the late 1940s, Paulucci noticed a growing market for prepared Chinese food. Borrowing $2,500 from a friend, he started canning chow mein \"seasoned to [his] own Italian taste\", and selling it to retailers under the label [[Chun King]]. Chun King came to encompass an entire line of prepared Chinese food; at that time not available in grocery stores. In 1966, he sold his enterprise for $63 million. In 1968, Paulucci founded [[Totino's|Jeno's Inc.]], a company that sold frozen pizzas and a variety of other \"Italian\" foods. The most notable of these was undoubtedly his own invention, the [[pizza roll]], a snack food consisting of an Italian filling wrapped in an egg roll wrapper. He sold Jeno's Inc. for $135 million in 1985. In the 1990s, he started [[Bellisio Foods]], a leading diversified frozen food company named after Paulucci's familial home in Italy, Bellisio Solfare.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/jeno-paulucci-a-pioneer-of-ready-made-ethnic-foods-dies-at-93.html?_r=1& | work=The New York Times | first=Daniel E. | last=Slotnik | title=Jeno Paulucci, a Pioneer of Ready-Made Ethnic Foods, Dies at 93 | date=November 25, 2011 | access-date=February 21, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301201314/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/jeno-paulucci-a-pioneer-of-ready-made-ethnic-foods-dies-at-93.html?_r=1& | archive-date=March 1, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Electric elevator===\n\nIn 1887, inventor [[Alexander Miles]] of Duluth patented an electric [[elevator]]. Although not the first elevator, the design was important for improving the method of opening and closing elevator doors, as well as closing the opening to the elevator shaft when an elevator was between floors. At that time, elevator patrons or operators were required to manually shut a door to cut off access to the shaft, and Miles created an automatic mechanism that closed that access.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bl_Alexander_Miles.htm|title=How Black Inventor Alexander Miles Improved Elevator Safety|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===First whole-plane parachute system on a certified aircraft===\n\n{{Main|Cirrus Airframe Parachute System}}\n[[File:Caps deploy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Cirrus Airframe Parachute System]] deployment (1998)]]\n \t\t \t\nIn association with southern Minnesota company [[Ballistic Recovery Systems]] (BRS), Duluth-based aircraft manufacturing company [[Cirrus Aircraft]] developed the [[Cirrus Airframe Parachute System]] (CAPS), the first whole-plane, emergency parachute recovery system to be installed on a line of [[type certification|type certified]] aircraft, the [[Cirrus SR20]] and [[Cirrus SR22|SR22]].<ref name=TheAtlantic/> A [[solid-fuel rocket]] housed in the [[fuselage]] is used to pull the parachute out from its housing and deploy the canopy full within seconds.
