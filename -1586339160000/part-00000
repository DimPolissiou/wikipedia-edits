Cleomenes intervened in 508 and 506 BCE, but could not stop Cleisthenes, now supported by the Athenians. Through Cleisthenes' reforms, the people of Athens endowed their city with [[isonomic]] institutions\u2014equal rights for all citizens (though only men were citizens)\u2014and established [[ostracism]].\n\n==Biography==\nHistorians estimate that Cleisthenes was born around 570 BCE.<ref>The Greeks:Crucible of Civilization (2000)</ref> Cleisthenes was the uncle of [[Pericles]]' mother Agariste<ref>Herodotus, ''Histories'' 6.131</ref> and of [[Alcibiades]]' maternal grandfather Megacles.<ref>Plutarch.

William Heinemann Ltd. 1916. 4.</ref>\n\n=== Rise to power ===\nWith help from the Spartans and the [[Alcmaeonidae]] (Cleisthenes' ''genos'', \"clan\"), he was responsible for overthrowing [[Hippias (son of Pisistratus)|Hippias]], the [[tyrant]] son of [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Pisistratus]]. After the collapse of Hippias' tyranny, [[Isagoras]] and Cleisthenes were rivals for power, but Isagoras won the upper hand by appealing to the Spartan king [[Cleomenes&nbsp;I]] to help him expel Cleisthenes. He did so on the pretext of the [[Alcmaeonidae|Alcmaeonid curse]]. Consequently, Cleisthenes left Athens as an exile, and Isagoras was unrivalled in power within the city. Isagoras set about dispossessing hundreds of Athenians of their homes and exiling them on the pretext that they too were cursed.  He also attempted to dissolve the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule]] (\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ae), a council of Athenian citizens appointed to run the daily affairs of the city. However, the council resisted, and the Athenian people declared their support of the council. Isagoras and his supporters were forced to flee to the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], remaining besieged there for two days. On the third day they fled the city and were banished. Cleisthenes was subsequently recalled, along with hundreds of exiles, and he assumed leadership of Athens.<ref>Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians, Chapter 20</ref>\n\n===Contribution to the governance of Athens===\n[[File:ATTICA, Athens.

Effigy of [[Athena]], with owl and \u0391\u0398\u0395, initials of \"[[Athens]]\". Circa 510-500/490 BCE.]]\nAfter this victory, Cleisthenes began to reform the government of Athens. He commissioned a [[bronze sculpture|bronze]] [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton (sculpture)|memorial]] from the [[Greek sculpture|sculptor]] [[Antenor]] in honor of the [[Greek love|lovers]] and [[tyrannicide]]s [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]], whom Hippias had executed. In order to forestall strife between the traditional clans, which had led to the [[tyranny]] in the first place, he changed the political organization from the four traditional tribes, which were based on family relations and which formed the basis of the upper class Athenian political power network, into ten tribes according to their area of residence (their ''[[deme]]'',) which would form the basis of a new democratic power structure.<ref>Aristotle, ''Politics'' 6.4.</ref>  It is thought that there may have been 139 demes (though this is still a matter of debate), each organized into three groups called ''[[Trittys|trittyes]]'' (\"thirds\"), with ten ''demes'' divided among three regions in each trittyes (a city region, ''[[asty]]''; a coastal region, ''[[Paralia (trittys)|paralia]]''; and an inland region, ''[[mesogeia]]'').<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians, Chapter 21</ref> Cleisthenes also abolished patronymics in favour of ''demonymics'' (a name given according to the deme to which one belongs), thus increasing Athenians' sense of belonging to a deme.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He also established [[sortition]] - the random selection of citizens to fill government positions rather than kinship or heredity, a true test of real democracy. He reorganized the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule]], created with 400 members under [[Solon]], so that it had 500 members, 50 from each tribe. He also introduced the bouletic oath, \"To advise according to the laws what was best for the people\".<ref>Morris & Raaflaub ''Democracy 2500?: Questions and Challenges''</ref> The court system (Dikasteria &mdash; law courts) was reorganized and had from 201&ndash;5001 jurors selected each day, up to 500 from each tribe. It was the role of the Boule to propose laws to the assembly of voters, who convened in Athens around forty times a year for this purpose. The bills proposed could be rejected, passed or returned for amendments by the assembly.\n\nCleisthenes also may have introduced [[ostracism]] (first used in 487&nbsp;BCE), whereby a vote by a plurality of citizens would exile a citizen for 10 years. The initial trend was to vote for a citizen deemed a threat to the democracy (e.g., by having ambitions to set himself up as tyrant). However, soon after, any citizen judged to have too much power in the city tended to be targeted for exile (e.g., [[Xanthippus]] in 485/84&nbsp;BCE).<ref>Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians, Chapter 22</ref> Under this system, the exiled man's property was maintained, but he was not physically in the city where he could possibly create a new tyranny. One later ancient author records that Cleisthenes himself was the first person to be ostracized.<ref>Aelian, Varia historia 13.24</ref>\n\nCleisthenes called these reforms ''[[isonomia]]'' (\"equality vis \u00e0 vis law\", ''iso-''=equality; ''nomos''=law), instead of ''[[Democracy|demokratia]]''. Cleisthenes' life after his reforms is unknown as no ancient texts mention him thereafter.\n\n==Attempt to obtain Persian support (507 BCE)==\n[[File:Ceremony of Presenting Earth and Water.jpg|thumb|According to Herodotus, the Athenians made the gift of \"[[Earth and Water]] to the Persians in 507 BCE, at the time Cleisthenes was leading Athenian politics.<ref name=\"penelope.uchicago.edu\">{{cite book |title=LacusCurtius \u2022 Herodotus \u2014 Book V: Chapters 55\u201196 |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/5C*.html}}</ref>]]\nIn 507 BC, during the time Cleisthenes was leading Athenian politics, and probably at his instigation, democratic [[Athens]] sent an embassy to [[Artaphernes]], brother of [[Darius I]] and Achaemenid Satrap of [[Asia Minor]] in the capital of [[Sardis]], looking for Persian assistance in order to resist the threats from [[Sparta]].<ref name=\"MW84\">{{cite book |last1=Waters |first1=Matt |title=Ancient Persia: A Concise History of the Achaemenid Empire, 550\u2013330 BCE |date=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107009608 |pages=84\u201385 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjhEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA84 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"MW123\">{{cite book |last1=Waters |first1=Matt |title=Ancient Persia: A Concise History of the Achaemenid Empire, 550\u2013330 BCE |date=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107009608 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjhEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA123 |language=en}}</ref> [[Herodotus]] reports that Artaphernes had no previous knowledge of the Athenians, and his initial reaction was \"Who are these people?\".<ref name=\"MW84\"/> Artaphernes asked the Athenians for \"Water and Earth\", a symbol of submission, if they wanted help from the Achaemenid king.<ref name=\"MW123\"/> The Athenian ambassadors apparently accepted to comply, and to give \"Earth and Water\".<ref name=\"MW84\"/> Artaphernes also advised the Athenians that they should receive back the Athenian [[tyrant]] [[Hippias (son of Pisistratus)|Hippias]].  The Persians threatened to attack Athens if they did not accept Hippias.

In order to forestall strife between the traditional clans, which had led to the [[tyranny]] in the first place, he changed the political organization from the four traditional tribes, which were based on family relations and which formed the basis of the upper class Athenian political power network, into ten tribes according to their area of residence (their ''[[deme]]'',) which would form the basis of a new democratic power structure.<ref>Aristotle, ''Politics'' 6.4.</ref>  It is thought that there may have been 139 demes (though this is still a matter of debate), each organized into three groups called ''[[Trittys|trittyes]]'' (\"thirds\"), with ten ''demes'' divided among three regions in each trittyes (a city region, ''[[asty]]''; a coastal region, ''[[Paralia (trittys)|paralia]]''; and an inland region, ''[[mesogeia]]'').<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians, Chapter 21</ref> Cleisthenes also abolished patronymics in favour of ''demonymics'' (a name given according to the deme to which one belongs), thus increasing Athenians' sense of belonging to a deme.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He also established [[sortition]] - the random selection of citizens to fill government positions rather than kinship or heredity, a true test of real democracy. He reorganized the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule]], created with 400 members under [[Solon]], so that it had 500 members, 50 from each tribe. He also introduced the bouletic oath, \"To advise according to the laws what was best for the people\".<ref>Morris & Raaflaub ''Democracy 2500?: Questions and Challenges''</ref> The court system (Dikasteria &mdash; law courts) was reorganized and had from 201&ndash;5001 jurors selected each day, up to 500 from each tribe. It was the role of the Boule to propose laws to the assembly of voters, who convened in Athens around forty times a year for this purpose. The bills proposed could be rejected, passed or returned for amendments by the assembly.\n\nCleisthenes also may have introduced [[ostracism]] (first used in 487&nbsp;BCE), whereby a vote by a plurality of citizens would exile a citizen for 10 years. The initial trend was to vote for a citizen deemed a threat to the democracy (e.g., by having ambitions to set himself up as tyrant). However, soon after, any citizen judged to have too much power in the city tended to be targeted for exile (e.g., [[Xanthippus]] in 485/84&nbsp;BCE).<ref>Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians, Chapter 22</ref> Under this system, the exiled man's property was maintained, but he was not physically in the city where he could possibly create a new tyranny. One later ancient author records that Cleisthenes himself was the first person to be ostracized.<ref>Aelian, Varia historia 13.24</ref>\n\nCleisthenes called these reforms ''[[isonomia]]'' (\"equality vis \u00e0 vis law\", ''iso-''=equality; ''nomos''=law), instead of ''[[Democracy|demokratia]]''. Cleisthenes' life after his reforms is unknown as no ancient texts mention him thereafter.\n\n==Attempt to obtain Persian support (507 BCE)==\n[[File:Ceremony of Presenting Earth and Water.jpg|thumb|According to Herodotus, the Athenians made the gift of \"[[Earth and Water]] to the Persians in 507 BCE, at the time Cleisthenes was leading Athenian politics.<ref name=\"penelope.uchicago.edu\">{{cite book |title=LacusCurtius \u2022 Herodotus \u2014 Book V: Chapters 55\u201196 |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/5C*.html}}</ref>]]\nIn 507 BC, during the time Cleisthenes was leading Athenian politics, and probably at his instigation, democratic [[Athens]] sent an embassy to [[Artaphernes]], brother of [[Darius I]] and Achaemenid Satrap of [[Asia Minor]] in the capital of [[Sardis]], looking for Persian assistance in order to resist the threats from [[Sparta]].<ref name=\"MW84\">{{cite book |last1=Waters |first1=Matt |title=Ancient Persia: A Concise History of the Achaemenid Empire, 550\u2013330 BCE |date=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107009608 |pages=84\u201385 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjhEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA84 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"MW123\">{{cite book |last1=Waters |first1=Matt |title=Ancient Persia: A Concise History of the Achaemenid Empire, 550\u2013330 BCE |date=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107009608 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjhEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA123 |language=en}}</ref> [[Herodotus]] reports that Artaphernes had no previous knowledge of the Athenians, and his initial reaction was \"Who are these people?\".<ref name=\"MW84\"/> Artaphernes asked the Athenians for \"Water and Earth\", a symbol of submission, if they wanted help from the Achaemenid king.<ref name=\"MW123\"/> The Athenians ambassadors apparently accepted to comply, and to give \"Earth and Water\".<ref name=\"MW84\"/> Artaphernes also advised the Athenians that they should receive back the Athenian [[tyrant]] [[Hippias (son of Pisistratus)|Hippias]].  The Persians threatened to attack Athens if they did not accept Hippias.

Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], heavily borrowing from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]''.<ref name=\"polygon oral\">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/3/17924770/assassins-creed-an-oral-history-patrice-desilets | title=  Assassin\u2019s Creed: An oral history | first = Richard | last = Moss | date = October 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 3, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> They developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin that served as a bodyguard for a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game ''Prince of Persia: Assassin''.

The first two games in the series, ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' and ''[[Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame]]'', were published by Br\u00f8derbund. ''[[Prince of Persia 3D]]'', the first to use [[3D computer graphics]], was developed by [[Red Orb Entertainment]] and published by The Learning Company on [[Personal computer|PC]], and developed by [[Avalanche Software]] and published by [[Mattel Interactive]] on [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]]. [[Ubisoft]] began developing and publishing the series in 2003 with ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]''.\n\nThe series has been rebooted twice since its acquisition by Ubisoft, and has been made into a film, ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (film)|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', penned in part by Mechner and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in 2010.
