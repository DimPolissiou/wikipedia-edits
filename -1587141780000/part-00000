The city consists of four autonomous parishes: Saint Helen, Saint Joseph the Worker, Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Saint Mary.

Various parishes and suburbs developed out of Birkirkara over the years, including [[Sliema]], [[St. Julian's]], [[Msida]], [[\u0126amrun]] in the 19th century and [[Santa Venera]] in the early 20th century. In more recent years, [[San \u0120wann]] (1965) and the hamlet of [[Ta' l-Ibra\u0121]] hived off Birkirkara to form part of the new parish and locality of [[Swieqi]] in 1993.\n\nThere are many places of interest in Birkirkara, which may not be either preserved nor protected,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/safeguarding-the-oldest-house-in-triq-il-kbira-birkirkara.687099|title=The oldest house in Birkirkara's Main Street faces demolition|website=Times of Malta}}</ref> amongst them the Old Railway Station which is today located within a public garden.

The main event of the celebration is a procession with a large wooden statue carved by the Maltese master-sculptor [[Salvu Psaila]].  Notably, this is the only procession (with a titular statue) on the island carried out in the morning. The procession leaves the basilica at exactly 8:00&nbsp;a.m. and returns to it at 10:45&nbsp;am.

The city consists of four autonomous parishes: Saint Helen, Saint Joseph, Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Saint Mary. The city's motto is ''[[In hoc signo vinces]]'', and its coat of arms is a plain red cross, surmounted by a crown.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Birkirkara, Valley road circa 1900.jpg|thumb|Valley road circa 1900]]\n''Birkirkara'' means \"cold water\" or \"running water\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abela|first1=Giovanni Francesco|authorlink1=Giovanni Francesco Abela|title=Della Descrizione di Malta Isola nel Mare Siciliano con le sue Antichit\u00e0, ed Altre Notizie|date=1647|publisher=Paolo Bonacota|page=90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krRTAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA90#v=onepage&q&f=false|language=Italian}}</ref> This is attributed to the valley in the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/53136/1/ISIMHA%20...%20NIESHA%20...%20GRAJJIETHA.pdf|title=Pullicino, F.

Various parishes and suburbs developed out of Birkirkara over the years, including [[Sliema]], [[St. Julian's]], [[Msida]], [[\u0126amrun]] in the 19th century and [[Santa Venera]] in the early 20th century. In more recent years, [[San \u0120wann]] (1965) and the hamlet of [[Ta' l-Ibra\u0121]] hived off Birkirkara to form part of the new parish and locality of [[Swieqi]] in 1993.\n\nThere are many places of interest in Birkirkara, which may not be either preserved nor protected,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/safeguarding-the-oldest-house-in-triq-il-kbira-birkirkara.687099|title=The oldest house in Birkirkara's Main Street faces demolition|website=Times of Malta}}</ref> amongst them the Old Railway Station which is today located within a public garden.

The main event of the celebration is a procession with a large wooden statue carved by the Maltese master-sculptor [[Salvu Psaila]].  Notably, this is the only procession (with a titular statue) on the island carried out in the morning. The procession leaves the basilica at exactly 8:00&nbsp;a.m. and returns to it at 10:45&nbsp;am.

However, landers and rovers have successfully explored Mars\u2019 surface and delivered information about conditions on the ground. \n\nReasons for colonizing Mars include pure curiosity, the potential for the in-depth research humans can provide relative to that delivered by rovers, economic interest in its resources, and the thought that the settlement of other planets could decrease the likelihood of human extinction. Difficulties and hazards include radiation exposure during a trip to Mars and on its surface, toxic soil, low gravity, the isolation that accompanies Mars' distance from Earth, lack of water, and cold temperatures. \n\nThe most recent commitments to researching permanent settlement include those by public space agencies [[NASA]], [[ESA]], [[Roscosmos]], [[Indian Space Research Organisation|ISRO]] and the [[China National Space Administration|CNSA]], and those by private organizations such as [[SpaceX]], [[Lockheed Martin]], and [[Boeing]].\n\n==Mission concepts and timelines==\n[[File: Humans on Mars.jpg|thumb|Various components of a human Mars surface mission]]\nSince the 20th century, there have been several proposed [[human missions to Mars]] both by government agencies and private companies.{{vague|date=March 2020}}\n\nAll of the human mission concepts as currently conceived by national governmental space programs would not be direct precursors to colonization.

However, landers and rovers have successfully explored Mars\u2019 surface and delivered information about conditions on the ground. \n\nReasons for colonizing Mars include pure curiosity, the potential for the in-depth research humans can provide relative to that delivered by rovers, economic interest in its resources, and the thought that the settlement of other planets could decrease the likelihood of human extinction. Difficulties and hazards include radiation exposure during a trip to Mars and on its surface, toxic soil, low gravity, the isolation that accompanies Mars' distance from Earth, lack of water, and cold temperatures. \n\nThe most recent commitments to researching permanent settlement include those by public space agencies [[NASA]], [[ESA]], [[Roscosmos]], [[Indian Space Research Organisation|ISRO]] and the [[China National Space Administration|CNSA]], and those by private organizations such as [[SpaceX]], [[Lockheed Martin]], and [[Boeing]].\n\n==Mission concepts and timelines==\n[[File: Humans on Mars.jpg|thumb|Various components of a human Mars surface mission]]\nSince the 20th century, there have been several proposed [[human missions to Mars]] both by government agencies and private companies.{{vague|date=March 2020}}\n\nAll of the human mission concepts as currently conceived by national governmental space programs would not be direct precursors to colonization. Programs such as those being tentatively planned by [[NASA]], [[Russian Federal Space Agency|Roscosmos]], and [[ESA]] are intended solely as exploration missions, with the establishment of a permanent base possible but not yet the main goal. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nColonization requires the establishment of permanent habitats that have the potential for self-expansion and self-sustenance. Two early proposals for building habitats on Mars are the [[Mars Direct]] and the [[Mars Direct#Revisions|Semi-Direct]] concepts, advocated by [[Robert Zubrin]], an advocate of the colonization of Mars.<ref name=\"zubrin1996\" />\n\n[[Elon Musk]] and [[SpaceX]] have proposed the development of [[SpaceX Mars transportation infrastructure|Mars transportation infrastructure]] in order to facilitate the eventual colonization of Mars.

These would need to be designed to handle the harsh Martian environment and would either have to be serviceable whilst wearing an EVA suit or housed inside a human habitable environment. For example, if electricity generation systems rely on solar power, large energy storage facilities will also be needed to cover the periods when dust storms block out the sun, and automatic dust removal systems may be needed to avoid human exposure to conditions on the surface.<ref name=Fenton/> If the colony is to scale beyond a few people, systems will also need to maximise use of local resources to reduce the need for resupply from Earth, for example by recycling water and oxygen and being adapted to be able to use any water found on Mars, whatever form it is in.\n\n===Communication with Earth===\nCommunications with Earth are relatively straightforward during the half-[[Sol (day of Mars)|sol]] when Earth is above the Martian horizon. NASA and ESA included communications relay equipment in several of the Mars orbiters, so Mars already has [[communications satellite]]s. While these will eventually wear out, additional orbiters with communication relay capability are likely to be launched before any colonization expeditions are mounted.\n\nThe one-way communication delay due to the [[speed of light]] ranges from about 3 minutes at closest approach (approximated by perihelion of Mars minus aphelion of Earth) to 22&nbsp;minutes at the largest possible superior conjunction (approximated by aphelion of Mars plus aphelion of Earth). Real-time communication, such as telephone conversations or [[Internet Relay Chat]], between Earth and Mars would be highly impractical due to the long time lags involved. NASA has found that direct communication can be blocked for about two weeks every [[synodic period]], around the time of [[superior conjunction]] when the [[Sun]] is directly between Mars and Earth,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/spotlight/20061020.html |title= During Solar Conjunction, Mars Spacecraft Will Be on Autopilot |work=Spotlight |publisher=JPL, NASA |date= October 20, 2006}}</ref> although the actual duration of the communications blackout varies from mission to mission depending on various factors\u2014such as the amount of link margin designed into the communications system, and the minimum data rate that is acceptable from a mission standpoint.

According to NASA's policies, it is forbidden for members of the crew to engage in [[sex in space]]. NASA wants its crewmembers to treat each other like coworkers would in a professional environment. A pregnant member on a spacecraft is dangerous to all those aboard. The pregnant woman and child would most likely need additional nutrition from the rations aboard, as well as special treatment and care. At some point during the trip, the pregnancy would most likely impede on the [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] crew member's duties and abilities. It is still not fully known how the environment in a spacecraft would affect the development of a child aboard. It is known however that an unborn child in space would be more susceptible to solar radiation, which would likely have a negative effect on its cells and genetics.<ref>Minkel, JR. \"Sex and Pregnancy on Mars: A Risky Proposition.\" ''Space.com''.
