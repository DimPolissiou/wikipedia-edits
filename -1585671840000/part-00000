His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and ended up opening for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Despite a promising success, the band broke up in the late 1970s and Squier, the band's frontman, left to pursue a solo career.\n\nSquier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and released his solo debut in spring of 1980. ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signerature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling about 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in an 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for 6 weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier's fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' came in September 1984 and brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. Co-produced by a veteran songwriter [[Jim Steinman]], ''Signs of Life'' saw Squier melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; he reportedly played for half-empty arenas on the most dates of Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued the tour and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, performing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 song on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video, more familiar to his style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold a disappointing 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. It was also Squier's first album not to be supported with a tour since Capitol decided not to promote it - which later built strong tensions between the label and Squier.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]].'' It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did partly restore Squier's success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock with small hints of then-successful glam metal; it's nowadays regarded as one of the strongest inputs of his catalogue by his fanbase. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled No Excess was also well received. However, despite a promising comeback chances, Squier's popularity continued to descend and he wasn't able to pull off a notable return anymore.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990's and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. The album was criticized for the lack of innovation in songwriting and peaked only at #117 in US, becoming his lowest charting album since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies, despite its opening track \"Angry\" receiving modest airplay and becoming his last new entry on the Mainstream Rock charts. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He embarked on a mini-tour to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\".{{unsourced|section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier joined [[Bad Company]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]] on a nationwide summer tour.\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"\n\nSampling of \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" continued as of 2016. The late [[Jam Master Jay]]'s reference to the song as a classic beat in the early days of hip hop paid great dividends for Squier. The three-piece hip hop group [[Run DMC]] performed a track live at The Funhouse entitled \"Here We Go,\" using the song's backbeat. [[Jay-Z]]'s \"99 Problems,\" a massive hit in 2003, was on that beat, as were British grime/hip-hop MC Dizzee Rascal's \"Fix Up, Look Sharp\" [[Kanye West]]'s \"Addiction\" and, in 2012, the [[Alicia Keys]] selection \"Girl on Fire.\"\n\n<br />{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton.

In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years.

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews.

He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]].

In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and ended up opening for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].

Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; he reportedly played for half-empty arenas on the most dates of Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued the tour and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, performing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth song to climb inside the Top 10 on Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video, more familiar to his style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold a disappointing 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. It was also Squier's first album not to be supported with a tour since Capitol decided not to promote it - which later built strong tensions between the label and Squier.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989. The album peaked only at #64, but still ended up selling a bit better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]].'' It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did partly restore Squier's success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock with small hints of then-successful glam metal; it's nowadays regarded as one of the strongest inputs of his catalogue by his fanbase. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled No Excess was also well received. However, despite a promising comeback chances, Squier's popularity continued to descend and he wasn't able to pull off a notable return anymore.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990's and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. The album was criticized for the lack of innovation in songwriting and peaked only at #117 in US, becoming his lowest charting album since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, which was his last bigger one for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier put out his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies, despite its opening track \"Angry\" receiving modest airplay and becoming his last new entry on the Mainstream Rock charts. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He embarked on a mini-tour to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\".{{unsourced|section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier joined [[Bad Company]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]] on a nationwide summer tour.\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"\n\nSampling of \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" continued as of 2016. The late [[Jam Master Jay]]'s reference to the song as a classic beat in the early days of hip hop paid great dividends for Squier. The three-piece hip hop group [[Run DMC]] performed a track live at The Funhouse entitled \"Here We Go,\" using the song's backbeat. [[Jay-Z]]'s \"99 Problems,\" a massive hit in 2003, was on that beat, as were British grime/hip-hop MC Dizzee Rascal's \"Fix Up, Look Sharp\" [[Kanye West]]'s \"Addiction\" and, in 2012, the [[Alicia Keys]] selection \"Girl on Fire.\"\n\n<br />{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years.

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews. He also supported the Group for the East End and its native planting programs on eastern Long Island.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Post|date=May 14, 2000|url=https://nypost.com/2000/05/14/rocker-billys-a-country-squier/|title=Rocker Billy's A Country \u2018Squier\u2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=New York Social Diary|date=September 2, 2015|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/guest-diary/2015/end-of-summer-doings-at-madoo|title=End of Summer Doings at Madoo}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Billy Squier discography}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n*''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' (1981)\n*''[[Emotions in Motion]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'' (1991)\n*''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'' (1993)\n*''[[Happy Blue (Billy Squier album)|Happy Blue]]'' (1998)\n\n===Non-album soundtrack contributions===\n*''Fast Times (The Best Years Of Our Lives)'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Fast Times At Ridgemont High]]'' (1982)\n*''On Your Own'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1984)\n*''Shake Down'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<!--unused<ref name=\"parker\">{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Lyndsey|title=Martha, Martha, Martha! 35 Years Later, Original VJ Quinn Remembers MTV's Early Days|url=https://www.yahoo.com/music/martha-martha-martha-35-years-later-original-vj-quinn-remembers-mtvs-early-days-042906236.html|website=Yahoo!

{"title_page": "Ground effect (cars)", "text_new": "In car design, '''ground effect''' is a series of [[aerodynamic]] effects which have been exploited to create [[downforce]], particularly in racing cars. This has been the successor to the earlier dominant aerodynamic theory of streamlining. American racing [[IndyCar]]s employ ground effects in their engineering and designs. Similarly, they are also employed in other racing series to some extent; however [[Formula One]] and many other racing series, primarily across Europe, employ regulations (or complete bans) to limit its effectiveness on safety grounds.\n\n==Theory==\nIn racing cars, a designer's aim is for increased downforce and grip to achieve higher cornering speeds. A substantial amount of downforce is available by understanding the ground to be part of the aerodynamic system in question, hence the name \"ground effect\". Starting in the mid-1960s, [[Wing (automotive)|'wings']] were routinely used in the design of race cars to increase downforce (this is ''not'' a type of ground effect). Designers shifted their efforts at understanding air flow around the perimeter, body skirts, and undersides of the vehicle to increase downforce with less drag than compared to using a wing.\n\nThis kind of ground effect is easily illustrated by taking a [[tarpaulin]] out on a windy day and holding it close to the ground: it can be observed that when close enough to the ground the tarp will be drawn towards the ground. This is due to [[Bernoulli's principle]]; as the tarp gets closer to the ground, the cross sectional area available for the air passing between it and the ground shrinks. This causes the air to accelerate and as a result pressure under the tarp drops while the pressure on top is unaffected, and together this results in a net downward force. The same principles apply to cars.\n\nThe Bernoulli principle is not the only mechanic in generating ground effect downforce. A large part of ground effect performance comes from taking advantage of [[viscosity]]. In the tarp example above neither the tarp nor the ground is moving. The [[boundary layer]] between the two surfaces works to slow down the air between them which lessens the Bernoulli effect. When a car moves over the ground the boundary layer on the ground becomes helpful. In the reference frame of the car, the ground is moving backwards at some speed. As the ground moves, it pulls on the air above it and causes it to move faster. This enhances the Bernoulli effect and increases downforce. It is an example of [[Couette flow]].\n\nWhile such downforce-producing aerodynamic techniques are often referred to with the catch-all term \"ground effect\", they are not strictly speaking a result of the same aerodynamic phenomenon as the [[Ground effect in aircraft|ground effect]] which is apparent in aircraft at very low [[altitude]]s.\n\n==History==\nAmerican [[Jim Hall (race car driver)|Jim Hall]] built his developed [[Chaparral Cars|Chaparral]] cars to both these principles, pioneering them. His 1961 car attempted to use the shaped underside method but there were too many other aerodynamic problems with the car for it to work properly. His 1966 cars used a dramatic high wing for their downforce. His [[Chaparral 2J]] \"sucker car\" of 1970 was revolutionary. It had two fans at the rear of the car driven by a dedicated [[two-stroke]] engine; it also had \"skirts\", which left only a minimal gap between car and ground, to seal the cavity from the atmosphere. Although it did not win a race, some competition had lobbied for its ban, which came into place at the end of that year. Movable aerodynamic devices were banned from most branches of the sport.<ref name=\"Ground Effects\">{{Harvnb|Nye|1985|p=94}}</ref>\n\n[[Formula One]] was the next setting for ground effect in racing cars. Several Formula One designs came close to the ground effect solution which would eventually be implemented by Lotus. In 1968 and 1969, [[Tony Rudd]] and [[Peter Wright (racing car designer)|Peter Wright]] at [[British Racing Motors]] (BRM) experimented on track and in the wind tunnel with long aerodynamic section side panniers to clean up the turbulent airflow between the front and rear wheels. Both left the team shortly after and the idea was not taken further. Robin Herd at [[March Engineering]], on a suggestion from Wright, used a similar concept on the 1970 March Formula One car. In both cars the sidepods were too far away from the ground for significant ground effect to be generated, and the idea of sealing the space under the wing section to the ground had not yet been developed.<ref name=\"Ground Effects\" />\n\nAt about the same time, Shawn Buckley began his work in 1969 at the Univ. of California - Berkeley on undercar aerodynamics sponsored by [[Colin Chapman]], founder of Formula One [[Team Lotus|Lotus]]. Buckley had previously designed the first high wing used in an [[IndyCar]], Jerry Eisert's \"Bat Car\" of the [[1966 Indianapolis 500]]. By proper shaping of the car's underside, the air speed there could be increased, lowering the pressure and pulling the car down onto the track. His test vehicles had a [[Venturi effect|Venturi]]-like channel beneath the cars sealed by flexible side skirts that separated the channel from above-car aerodynamics. He investigated how flow separation on the undersurface channel could be influenced by boundary layer suction and divergence parameters of the underbody surface.<ref>S. Buckley, \"Vehicle Surface Interaction\" Ph.D. Dissertation, University of California - Berkeley, Sept., 1972</ref><ref>B. Shawn Buckley, \"Road Test Aerodynamic Instrumentation\", SAE paper 741030, 1974-02-01</ref><ref>B. Shawn Buckley, Edmund V. Laitone, \"Air Flow Beneath an Automobile\", SAE paper 741028, 1974-02-01</ref> Later, as a mechanical engineering professor at MIT, Buckley worked with Lotus developing the [[Lotus 78]].\n\nOn a different tack, Brabham designer Gordon Murray used air dams at the front of his [[Brabham BT44]]s in 1974 to exclude air from flowing under the vehicle. Upon discovering that these tended to wear away with the pitching movement of the car, he placed them further back and discovered that a small area of negative pressure was formed under the car, generating a useful amount of downforce - around {{convert|150|lbs|disp=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. McLaren produced similar underbody details for their McLaren M23 design.<ref name=\"Ground Effects\" />\n[[Image:2001 Goodwood Festival of Speed Brabham BT46B Fan car.jpg|thumb|right|Brabham-Alfa's [[BT46|BT46B]] used a large fan to reduce underbody air pressure.]]\nIn 1977 Rudd and Wright, now at Lotus, developed the [[Lotus 78]] 'wing car', based on a concept from [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] owner and designer [[Colin Chapman]]. Its sidepods, bulky constructions between front and rear wheels, were shaped as inverted aerofoils and sealed with flexible \"skirts\" to the ground. The design of the radiators, embedded into the sidepods, was partly based on that of the [[de Havilland Mosquito]] aircraft.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nye|1985|p=96}}</ref> The team won five races that year, and two in 1978 while they developed the much improved [[Lotus 79]]. The most notable contender in 1978 was the [[Brabham]]-[[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] [[Brabham BT46|BT46B]] Fancar, designed by [[Gordon Murray]]. Its fan, spinning on a horizontal, longitudinal axis at the back of the car, took its power from the main gearbox. The car avoided the sporting ban by claims that the fan's main purpose was for engine cooling, as less than 50% of the airflow was used to create a depression under the car. It raced just once, with [[Niki Lauda]] winning at the Swedish Grand Prix. The car's advantage was proven after the track became oily. While other cars had to slow, Lauda was able to accelerate over the oil due to the tremendous downforce which rose with engine speed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nye|1985|p=130}}</ref> The car was also observed to squat when the engine was revved at a standstill.<ref>[http://www.forix.com/8w/fancar.html 8W - Why? - Brabham BT46B<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Brabham's owner, [[Bernie Ecclestone]], who had recently become president of the [[Formula One Constructors Association]], reached an agreement with other teams to withdraw the car after three races. However the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), governing body of Formula One and many other motor sports, decided to ban 'fan cars' with almost immediate effect.<ref>{{Harvnb|Henry|1985|pp=186\u2013187}}</ref> The Lotus 79, on the other hand, went on to win six races and the world championship for [[Mario Andretti]] and gave teammate [[Ronnie Peterson]] a posthumous second place, demonstrating just how much of an advantage the cars had. In following years other teams copied and improved on the Lotus until cornering speeds became dangerously high, resulting in several severe accidents in 1982; flat undersides became mandatory for 1983.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nye|1985|p=33}}</ref> Part of the danger of relying on ground effects to corner at high speeds is the possibility of the sudden removal of this force; if the belly of the car contacts the ground, the flow is constricted too much, resulting in almost total loss of any ground effects.  If this occurs in a corner where the driver is relying on this force to stay on the track, its sudden removal can cause the car to abruptly lose most of its traction and skid off the track. However, ground effect is set to return to Formula 1 in 2022 under the latest set of regulation changes.\n\nThe effect was used in its most effective form in [[IndyCar]] designs.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Porpoising==\n\"Porpoising\" is a term that was commonly used to describe a particular fault encountered in ground effect racing cars.\n\nRacing cars had only been using their bodywork to generate downforce for just over a decade when [[Colin Chapman]]'s [[Lotus 78]] and [[lotus 79|79]] cars demonstrated that ground effect was the future in Formula One, so, at this point, under-car aerodynamics were still very poorly understood. To compound this problem the teams that were keenest to pursue ground effects tended to be the more poorly funded British \"garagiste\" teams, who had little money to spare for wind tunnel testing, and tended simply to mimic the front-running Lotuses (including the [[Kauhsen]] and [[Merzario]] teams).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nThis led to a generation of cars that were designed as much by hunch as by any great knowledge of the finer details, making them extremely pitch-sensitive. As the centre of pressure on the sidepod aerofoils moved about depending on the car's speed, attitude, and ground clearance, these forces interacted with the car's suspension systems, and the cars began to resonate, particularly at slow speeds, rocking back and forth - sometimes quite violently.  Some drivers were known to complain of sea-sickness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} This rocking motion, like a [[porpoise]] diving into and out of the sea as it swims at speed, gives the phenomenon its name.  These characteristics, combined with a rock-hard suspension, resulted in the cars giving an extremely unpleasant ride. Ground effects were largely banned from Formula One in the early 1980s, but Group C sportscars and other racing cars continued to suffer from porpoising until better knowledge of ground effects allowed designers to minimise the problem.<ref name=\"elleray\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mulsannescorner.com/bentleyelleray.html |title=Mulsanne's Corner: Peter Elleray on the Bentley LMGTP |last=Elleray |first=Peter |website=Mulsanne's Corner |access-date=2017-10-21}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Automotive aerodynamics]]\n*[[Venturi effect]]\n*[[Ground effect in aircraft]]\n*[[Ground effect train]]\n*[[Formula One car]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n* {{Citation\n | surname1=Henry\n | given1=Alan\n | year=1985\n | title=Brabham, the Grand Prix Cars\n | publisher=Osprey\n | isbn=0-905138-36-8\n | url=\n | accessdate=\n}}\n* {{Citation\n | surname1=Nye\n | given1=Doug\n | year=1985\n | title=Autocourse History of the Grand Prix car 1966\u20131985\n | publisher=Hazleton publishing\n | isbn=0-905138-37-6\n | url=\n | accessdate=\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.photoessayist.com/canam/chaparral/index.html Photoessayist.com: The Chaparral 2J]\n* [http://www.vintagerpm.com/can-am-history-of-chaparral/ VintageRPM: Chaparral history]\n* [http://8w.forix.com/fancar.html 8W: Brabham-Alfa BT46B \"fan car\"]\n* [http://www.ddavid.com/formula1/lotus79.htm Dennis David: Lotus 79]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ground Effect (Cars)}}\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Motorsport terminology]]\n[[Category:Vehicle dynamics]]\n", "text_old": "In car design, '''ground effect''' is a series of [[aerodynamic]] effects which have been exploited to create [[downforce]], particularly in racing cars. This has been the successor to the earlier dominant aerodynamic theory of streamlining. American racing [[IndyCar]]s employ ground effects in their engineering and designs. Similarly, they are also employed in other racing series to some extent; however [[Formula One]] and many other racing series, primarily across Europe, employ regulations (or complete bans) to limit its effectiveness on safety grounds.\n\n==Theory==\nIn racing cars, a designer's aim is for increased downforce and grip to achieve higher cornering speeds. A substantial amount of downforce is available by understanding the ground to be part of the aerodynamic system in question, hence the name \"ground effect\". Starting in the mid-1960s, [[Wing (automotive)|'wings']] were routinely used in the design of race cars to increase downforce (this is ''not'' a type of ground effect). Designers shifted their efforts at understanding air flow around the perimeter, body skirts, and undersides of the vehicle to increase downforce with less drag than compared to using a wing.\n\nThis kind of ground effect is easily illustrated by taking a [[tarpaulin]] out on a windy day and holding it close to the ground: it can be observed that when close enough to the ground the tarp will be drawn towards the ground. This is due to [[Bernoulli's principle]]; as the tarp gets closer to the ground, the cross sectional area available for the air passing between it and the ground shrinks. This causes the air to accelerate and as a result pressure under the tarp drops while the pressure on top is unaffected, and together this results in a net downward force. The same principles apply to cars.\n\nThe Bernoulli principle is not the only mechanic in generating ground effect downforce. A large part of ground effect performance comes from taking advantage of [[viscosity]]. In the tarp example above neither the tarp nor the ground is moving. The [[boundary layer]] between the two surfaces works to slow down the air between them which lessens the Bernoulli effect. When a car moves over the ground the boundary layer on the ground becomes helpful. In the reference frame of the car, the ground is moving backwards at some speed. As the ground moves, it pulls on the air above it and causes it to move faster. This enhances the Bernoulli effect and increases downforce. It is an example of [[Couette flow]].\n\nWhile such downforce-producing aerodynamic techniques are often referred to with the catch-all term \"ground effect\", they are not strictly speaking a result of the same aerodynamic phenomenon as the [[Ground effect in aircraft|ground effect]] which is apparent in aircraft at very low [[altitude]]s.\n\n==History==\nAmerican [[Jim Hall (race car driver)|Jim Hall]] built his developed [[Chaparral Cars|Chaparral]] cars to both these principles, pioneering them. His 1961 car attempted to use the shaped underside method but there were too many other aerodynamic problems with the car for it to work properly. His 1966 cars used a dramatic high wing for their downforce. His [[Chaparral 2J]] \"sucker car\" of 1970 was revolutionary. It had two fans at the rear of the car driven by a dedicated [[two-stroke]] engine; it also had \"skirts\", which left only a minimal gap between car and ground, to seal the cavity from the atmosphere. Although it did not win a race, some competition had lobbied for its ban, which came into place at the end of that year. Movable aerodynamic devices were banned from most branches of the sport.<ref name=\"Ground Effects\">{{Harvnb|Nye|1985|p=94}}</ref>\n\n[[Formula One]] was the next setting for ground effect in racing cars. Several Formula One designs came close to the ground effect solution which would eventually be implemented by Lotus. In 1968 and 1969, [[Tony Rudd]] and [[Peter Wright (racing car designer)|Peter Wright]] at [[British Racing Motors]] (BRM) experimented on track and in the wind tunnel with long aerodynamic section side panniers to clean up the turbulent airflow between the front and rear wheels. Both left the team shortly after and the idea was not taken further. Robin Herd at [[March Engineering]], on a suggestion from Wright, used a similar concept on the 1970 March Formula One car. In both cars the sidepods were too far away from the ground for significant ground effect to be generated, and the idea of sealing the space under the wing section to the ground had not yet been developed.<ref name=\"Ground Effects\" />\n\nAt about the same time, Shawn Buckley began his work in 1969 at the Univ. of California - Berkeley on undercar aerodynamics sponsored by [[Colin Chapman]], founder of Formula One [[Team Lotus|Lotus]]. Buckley had previously designed the first high wing used in an [[IndyCar]], Jerry Eisert's \"Bat Car\" of the [[1966 Indianapolis 500]]. By proper shaping of the car's underside, the air speed there could be increased, lowering the pressure and pulling the car down onto the track. His test vehicles had a [[Venturi effect|Venturi]]-like channel beneath the cars sealed by flexible side skirts that separated the channel from above-car aerodynamics. He investigated how flow separation on the undersurface channel could be influenced by boundary layer suction and divergence parameters of the underbody surface.<ref>S. Buckley, \"Vehicle Surface Interaction\" Ph.D. Dissertation, University of California - Berkeley, Sept., 1972</ref><ref>B. Shawn Buckley, \"Road Test Aerodynamic Instrumentation\", SAE paper 741030, 1974-02-01</ref><ref>B. Shawn Buckley, Edmund V. Laitone, \"Air Flow Beneath an Automobile\", SAE paper 741028, 1974-02-01</ref> Later, as a mechanical engineering professor at MIT, Buckley worked with Lotus developing the [[Lotus 78]].\n\nOn a different tack, Brabham designer Gordon Murray used air dams at the front of his [[Brabham BT44]]s in 1974 to exclude air from flowing under the vehicle. Upon discovering that these tended to wear away with the pitching movement of the car, he placed them further back and discovered that a small area of negative pressure was formed under the car, generating a useful amount of downforce - around {{convert|150|lbs|disp=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. McLaren produced similar underbody details for their McLaren M23 design.<ref name=\"Ground Effects\" />\n[[Image:2001 Goodwood Festival of Speed Brabham BT46B Fan car.jpg|thumb|right|Brabham-Alfa's [[BT46|BT46B]] used a large fan to reduce underbody air pressure.]]\nIn 1977 Rudd and Wright, now at Lotus, developed the [[Lotus 78]] 'wing car', based on a concept from [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] owner and designer [[Colin Chapman]]. Its sidepods, bulky constructions between front and rear wheels, were shaped as inverted aerofoils and sealed with flexible \"skirts\" to the ground. The design of the radiators, embedded into the sidepods, was partly based on that of the [[de Havilland Mosquito]] aircraft.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nye|1985|p=96}}</ref> The team won five races that year, and two in 1978 while they developed the much improved [[Lotus 79]]. The most notable contender in 1978 was the [[Brabham]]-[[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] [[Brabham BT46|BT46B]] Fancar, designed by [[Gordon Murray]]. Its fan, spinning on a horizontal, longitudinal axis at the back of the car, took its power from the main gearbox. The car avoided the sporting ban by claims that the fan's main purpose was for engine cooling, as less than 50% of the airflow was used to create a depression under the car. It raced just once, with [[Niki Lauda]] winning at the Swedish Grand Prix. The car's advantage was proven after the track became oily. While other cars had to slow, Lauda was able to accelerate over the oil due to the tremendous downforce which rose with engine speed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nye|1985|p=130}}</ref> The car was also observed to squat when the engine was revved at a standstill.<ref>[http://www.forix.com/8w/fancar.html 8W - Why? - Brabham BT46B<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Brabham's owner, [[Bernie Ecclestone]], who had recently become president of the [[Formula One Constructors Association]], reached an agreement with other teams to withdraw the car after three races. However the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), governing body of Formula One and many other motor sports, decided to ban 'fan cars' with almost immediate effect.<ref>{{Harvnb|Henry|1985|pp=186\u2013187}}</ref> The Lotus 79, on the other hand, went on to win six races and the world championship for [[Mario Andretti]] and gave teammate [[Ronnie Peterson]] a posthumous second place, demonstrating just how much of an advantage the cars had. In following years other teams copied and improved on the Lotus until cornering speeds became dangerously high, resulting in several severe accidents in 1982; flat undersides became mandatory for 1983.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nye|1985|p=33}}</ref> Part of the danger of relying on ground effects to corner at high speeds is the possibility of the sudden removal of this force; if the belly of the car contacts the ground, the flow is constricted too much, resulting in almost total loss of any ground effects.  If this occurs in a corner where the driver is relying on this force to stay on the track, its sudden removal can cause the car to abruptly lose most of its traction and skid off the track. However, ground effect is set to return to Formula 1 in 2021 under the latest set of regulation changes.\n\nThe effect was used in its most effective form in [[IndyCar]] designs.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Porpoising==\n\"Porpoising\" is a term that was commonly used to describe a particular fault encountered in ground effect racing cars.\n\nRacing cars had only been using their bodywork to generate downforce for just over a decade when [[Colin Chapman]]'s [[Lotus 78]] and [[lotus 79|79]] cars demonstrated that ground effect was the future in Formula One, so, at this point, under-car aerodynamics were still very poorly understood. To compound this problem the teams that were keenest to pursue ground effects tended to be the more poorly funded British \"garagiste\" teams, who had little money to spare for wind tunnel testing, and tended simply to mimic the front-running Lotuses (including the [[Kauhsen]] and [[Merzario]] teams).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nThis led to a generation of cars that were designed as much by hunch as by any great knowledge of the finer details, making them extremely pitch-sensitive. As the centre of pressure on the sidepod aerofoils moved about depending on the car's speed, attitude, and ground clearance, these forces interacted with the car's suspension systems, and the cars began to resonate, particularly at slow speeds, rocking back and forth - sometimes quite violently.  Some drivers were known to complain of sea-sickness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} This rocking motion, like a [[porpoise]] diving into and out of the sea as it swims at speed, gives the phenomenon its name.  These characteristics, combined with a rock-hard suspension, resulted in the cars giving an extremely unpleasant ride. Ground effects were largely banned from Formula One in the early 1980s, but Group C sportscars and other racing cars continued to suffer from porpoising until better knowledge of ground effects allowed designers to minimise the problem.<ref name=\"elleray\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mulsannescorner.com/bentleyelleray.html |title=Mulsanne's Corner: Peter Elleray on the Bentley LMGTP |last=Elleray |first=Peter |website=Mulsanne's Corner |access-date=2017-10-21}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Automotive aerodynamics]]\n*[[Venturi effect]]\n*[[Ground effect in aircraft]]\n*[[Ground effect train]]\n*[[Formula One car]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n* {{Citation\n | surname1=Henry\n | given1=Alan\n | year=1985\n | title=Brabham, the Grand Prix Cars\n | publisher=Osprey\n | isbn=0-905138-36-8\n | url=\n | accessdate=\n}}\n* {{Citation\n | surname1=Nye\n | given1=Doug\n | year=1985\n | title=Autocourse History of the Grand Prix car 1966\u20131985\n | publisher=Hazleton publishing\n | isbn=0-905138-37-6\n | url=\n | accessdate=\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.photoessayist.com/canam/chaparral/index.html Photoessayist.com: The Chaparral 2J]\n* [http://www.vintagerpm.com/can-am-history-of-chaparral/ VintageRPM: Chaparral history]\n* [http://8w.forix.com/fancar.html 8W: Brabham-Alfa BT46B \"fan car\"]\n* [http://www.ddavid.com/formula1/lotus79.htm Dennis David: Lotus 79]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ground Effect (Cars)}}\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Motorsport terminology]]\n[[Category:Vehicle dynamics]]\n", "name_user": "Alopezbl", "label": "safe", "comment": "When Ground effect will return to F1", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_effect_(cars)"}

A type of [[drum]] categorised as a [[semispherical drum]], they consist of a membrane called a [[drumhead|head]] stretched over a large bowl traditionally made of [[copper]]. Most modern timpani are ''pedal timpani'' and can be tuned quickly and accurately to specific pitches by skilled players through the use of a movable foot-pedal. They are played by striking the head with a specialized [[drum stick]] called a ''timpani stick'' or ''timpani mallet''. Timpani evolved from [[military drums]] to become a staple of the [[European classical music|classical]] [[orchestra]] by the last third of the 18th century. Today, they are used in many types of [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]]s, including [[concert band]]s, [[marching band]]s, [[orchestra]]s, and even in some [[rock bands]].\n\n''Timpani'' is an [[Italian language|Italian]] plural, the singular of which is ''timpano''. However, in [[English language|English]] the term timpano is only widely in use by practitioners: several are more typically referred to collectively as ''kettledrums'', ''timpani'', ''temple drums'', ''timp-toms'', or ''timps''. They are also often incorrectly termed ''timpanis''. A [[musician]] who plays timpani is a ''timpanist''.\n\n==Etymology and alternative spellings==\nFirst attested in English in the late 19th century, the Italian word ''timpani'' derives from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[Tympanum (hand drum)|tympanum]]'' (pl.

It is half of a [[symphonia]] (''i.e. another type of drum'') and it looks like a [[sieve]]. The tympanum is so named because it is a half, whence also the half-pearl is called a tympanum.

Quoted in {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Symphonia|volume=26|page=289|first=Kathleen|last=Schlesinger|authorlink=Kathleen Schlesinger}}</ref>\n\n== Construction ==\n=== Basic timpani ===\nThe basic timpano consists of a drum head stretched across the opening of a bowl typically made of copper<ref name=bridge/> or, in less expensive models, [[fiberglass]] or [[aluminum]]. In the [[Sachs\u2013Hornbostel|Sachs\u2013Hornbostel classification]], this makes timpani [[membranophone]]s. The head is affixed to a [[wikt:hoop|hoop]] (also called a ''flesh hoop''),<ref name=grove/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flesh%20hoop|title=Definition of FLESH HOOP|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-13}}</ref> which in turn is held onto the bowl by a ''counter hoop''.<ref name=grove/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/counter%20hoop|title=Definition of COUNTER HOOP|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-13}}</ref> The counter hoop is usually held in place with a number of tuning [[screw (simple machine)|screw]]s called ''tension rods'' placed regularly around the circumference. The head's tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Most timpani have six to eight tension rods.<ref name=bridge/>\n\nThe shape and material of the bowl's surface help to determine the drum's [[timbre]]. For example, [[Sphere|hemispheric]] bowls produce brighter tones while [[Parabola|parabolic]] bowls produce darker tones.<ref name=power>{{cite journal | last = Power | first = Andrew |date=April 1983 | title = Sound Production of the Timpani, Part 1 | journal = Percussive Notes | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 62\u201364 | publisher = [[Percussive Arts Society]] }}</ref> Modern timpani are generally made with copper due to its efficient regulation of internal and external temperatures relative to aluminum and fiberglass.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Richard K. |title=In Search of the Missing Fundamental |url=https://wtt.pauken.org/?page_id=6785 |website=The Well-Tempered Timpani |accessdate=September 23, 2018 |date=March 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Timpani setup.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Walter Light]] [[#Pedal timpani|pedal]] and [[#Chain timpani|chain]] timpani set up in three different combinations.]]\nTimpani come in a variety of sizes from about {{convert|84|cm|in|order=flip}} in diameter down to ''piccoli timpani'' of {{convert|30|cm|in|order=flip}} or less.<ref name=grove/> A 33-inch drum can produce C<sub>2</sub> (the C below the [[bass clef]]), and specialty piccoli timpani can play up into the [[treble clef]]. In [[Darius Milhaud]]'s 1923 [[ballet]] score ''[[La cr\u00e9ation du monde]]'', the timpanist must play F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub> (at the bottom of the treble clef).\n\nEach drum typically has a range of a [[perfect fifth]], or seven [[semitone]]s.<ref name=grove/>\n\n=== Machine timpani ===\nChanging the pitch of a timpani by turning each tension rod individually is a laborious process. In the late 19th century, mechanical systems to change the tension of the entire head at once were developed. Any timpani equipped with such a system may be considered ''machine timpani'', although this term commonly refers to drums that use a handle connected to a spider-type tuning mechanism.<ref name=bridge/>\n\n==== Pedal timpani ====\nBy far the most common type of timpani used today are pedal timpani, which allows the tension of the head to be adjusted using a pedal mechanism. Typically, the pedal is connected to the tension screws via an assembly of either [[cast metal]] or metal rods called the ''spider''.\n\n[[File:Dresden pedal.jpg|thumb|left|A pedal on a ''Dresden'' timpano\u2014the clutch (seen here on the left) must be disengaged to change the pitch of the drum.]]\n[[File:Timpani, Yamaha pedal timpani.jpg|thumb|The inside, bottom of a Yamaha pedal timpano, showing the mechanical tension-adjusting system]]\nThere are three types of pedal mechanisms in common use today:\n* The ''ratchet clutch'' system uses a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet and pawl]] to hold the pedal in place. The timpanist must first disengage the clutch before using the pedal to tune the drum. When the desired pitch is achieved, the timpanist must then reengage the clutch. Because the ratchet engages in only a fixed set of positions, the timpanist must fine-tune the drum by means of a fine-tuning handle.\n* In the ''balanced action'' system, a spring or [[hydraulic cylinder]] is used to balance the tension on the head so the pedal will stay in position and the head will stay at pitch. The pedal on a balanced action drum is sometimes called a ''floating pedal'' since there is no clutch holding it in place.\n* The ''friction clutch'' or ''post and clutch'' system uses a clutch that moves along a post. Disengaging the clutch frees it from the post, allowing the pedal to move without restraint.\n\nProfessional-level timpani use either the ratchet or friction system and have copper bowls. These drums can have one of two styles of pedals. The ''Dresden'' pedal is attached at the side nearest the timpanist and is operated by ankle motion. A ''Berlin''-style pedal is attached by means of a long arm to the opposite side of the timpani, and the timpanist must use his entire leg to adjust the pitch. In addition to a pedal, high-end instruments have a hand-operated fine-tuner, which allows the timpanist to make minute pitch adjustments. The pedal is on either the left or right side of the drum depending on the direction of the setup.\n\nMost school bands and orchestras below a [[university]] level use less expensive, more durable timpani with copper, fiberglass, or aluminum bowls. The mechanical parts of these instruments are almost completely contained within the frame and bowl. They may use any of the pedal mechanisms, though the balanced action system is by far the most common, followed by the friction clutch system. Many professionals also use these drums for outdoor performances due to their durability and lighter weight. The pedal is in the center of the drum itself.\n\n=== Chain timpani ===\n[[File:Chain timpani.jpg|thumb|220px|On chain timpani, a chain links the tension rods so a master handle can be used to turn them all at once.]]\nOn ''chain timpani'', the tension rods are connected by a [[roller chain]] much like the one found on a [[bicycle]], though some manufacturers have used other materials, including [[Wire rope|steel cable]]. In these systems, all the tension screws can then be tightened or loosened by one handle. Though far less common than pedal timpani, chain and cable drums still have practical uses. Occasionally, a timpanist is forced to place a drum behind other items, so he cannot reach it with his foot. Professionals may also use exceptionally large or small chain and cable drums for special low or high notes.\n\n=== Other tuning mechanisms ===\nA rare tuning mechanism allows the pitch to be changed by rotating the drum itself. A similar system is used on [[rototom]]s. Jenco, a company better known for [[Percussion instrument|mallet percussion]], made timpani tuned in this fashion.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Hans Schnellar, the timpanist of the [[Vienna Philharmonic]], developed a tuning mechanism in which the bowl is moved via a handle that connects to the base and the head remains stationary. These instruments are referred to as ''Viennese timpani'' (''Wiener Pauken'') or ''Schnellar timpani''.<ref>[http://drtrumpet.eu/MB-PDF/2001e_MB_ISMA_timpani.pdf Vibration patterns and sound analysis of the Viennese Timpani].

(2001), Proceedings of ISMA 2001</ref> [[Adams Musical Instruments]] developed a pedal-operated version of this tuning mechanism in the early 21st century.\n\n=== Heads ===\nLike most [[drumhead]]s, timpani heads can be made from two materials: animal [[skin]] (typically [[calfskin]] or [[goatskin (material)|goatskin]])<ref name=grove/> or [[plastic]] (typically [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]]). Plastic heads are durable, weather-resistant, and relatively inexpensive. Thus, they are more commonly used than skin heads. However, many professional timpanists prefer skin heads because they produce a \"warmer\" [[timbre]]. Timpani heads are determined based on the size of the head, not the bowl. For example, a {{convert|23|in|cm|adj=on}} drum may require a {{convert|25|in|cm|adj=on}} head. This {{convert|2|in|cm|0|adj=on}} size difference has been standardized by most timpani manufacturers since 1978.<ref>[http://www.steveweissmusic.com/product/timpani_head_size/articles \"Timpani Head Guide\"], ''Steve Weiss Music''</ref>\n\n== Sticks and mallets ==\n[[File:Timpani sticks.jpg|thumb|Timpanists use a variety of timpani sticks since each produces a different [[timbre]].]]\nTimpani are typically struck with a special type of [[drum stick]] called a ''timpani stick'' or ''timpani mallet''. Timpani sticks are used in pairs. They have two components: a shaft and a head. The shaft is typically made from [[hardwood]] or [[bamboo]] but may also be made from [[aluminum]] or [[carbon fiber]]. The head can be constructed from a number of different materials, though [[felt]] wrapped around a wooden core is the most common. Other core materials include compressed felt, [[Cork (material)|cork]], and [[leather]].<ref name=\"Of Music\">{{cite book |last1=Kallen |first1=Stuart |title=The Instruments of Music |date=2003 |publisher=Lucent Books |location=Farmington Hills, MI |isbn=978-1-59018-127-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/musiclibraryi00stua/page/24 24] |chapter-url=http://www.gale.com |accessdate=October 31, 2018 |chapter=One |url=https://archive.org/details/musiclibraryi00stua/page/24 }}</ref> Unwrapped sticks with heads of wood, felt, flannel, and leather are also common.<ref name=grove/> Wooden sticks are used as a special effect<ref>{{cite web |title=T5 Wood |url=http://vicfirth.com/products/band-orchestra/timpani-mallets/t5-wood/ |website=Vic Firth |accessdate=October 31, 2018}}</ref>\u2014specifically requested by composers as early as the Romantic era\u2014and in [[Historically informed performance|authentic performances]] of [[Baroque music]]. Wooden timpani sticks are also occasionally used to play the suspended cymbal.\n\nAlthough not usually stated in the score (excepting the occasional request to use wooden sticks), timpanists will change sticks to suit the nature of the music. However, the choice during a performance is subjective and depends on the timpanist's preference and occasionally the wishes of the conductor. Thus, most timpanists own a great number of sticks.<ref name=grove/> The weight of the stick, size and latent surface area of the head, materials used for the shaft, core, and wrap, and method used to wrap the head all contribute to the timbre the stick produces.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XexFFphAE0 Slow Motion of Timpani Technique | Percussion Research]. Retrieved 7 December 2012.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century and before, sticks were often made with whalebone shafts, wooden cores, and sponge wraps. Composers of that era often specified sponge-headed sticks. Modern timpanists execute such passages with felt sticks.\n\n== Popular grips ==\nThe two most common grips in playing the timpani are the [[Matched grip#German grip|German]] and [[Matched grip#French grip|French]] grips. In the German grip, the palm of the hand is approximately parallel with the drum head and the thumb should be on the side of the stick. In the French grip, the palm of the hand is approximately perpendicular with drum head and the thumb is on top of the stick. In both of these styles, the fulcrum is the contact between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger is used as a guide and to help lift the stick off of the drum.<ref name=\"Stewart Hoffman\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stewarthoffmanmusic.com/articles-percussion-techniques.php?id=47|title=Playing Timpani &#124; Timpani Techniques &#124; High School Percussion|last=Hoffman|first=Stewart|publisher=Stewart Hoffman Music|location=Toronto, ON|work=stewarthoffmanmusic.com|accessdate=August 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424225920/http://www.stewarthoffmanmusic.com/articles-percussion-techniques.php?id=47|archive-date=April 24, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The [[Matched grip#American grip|American]] grip is a hybrid of these two grips. Another known grip is known as the Amsterdam Grip, made famous by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, which is similar to the Hinger grip, except the stick is cradled on the lower knuckle of the index finger.\n\n== In the modern ensemble ==\n[[File:Standard timpani setup.jpg|thumb|left|A standard set of timpani consists of four drums.]]\n\n=== Standard set ===\nA standard set of timpani (sometimes called a console) consists of four drums: roughly {{convert|32|in|cm|0}}, {{convert|29|in|cm|0}}, {{convert|26|in|cm|0}}, and {{convert|23|in|cm|0}} in diameter.<ref name=goodman>{{cite book|last=Goodman |first=Saul |authorlink=Saul Goodman |title=Modern Method for Tympani |origyear=1948 |year=1988 |publisher=[[Alfred Publishing|Alfred Publishing Company, Inc.]] |location=[[Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California|Van Nuys]], [[California]] |isbn=978-0-7579-9100-4}}</ref> The range of this set is roughly [[scientific pitch notation|D<sub>2</sub> to A<sub>3</sub>]]. A great majority of the orchestral repertoire can be played using these four drums. However, contemporary composers have written for extended ranges. [[Igor Stravinsky]] specifically writes for a ''piccolo timpano'' in ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', tuned to B<sub>3</sub>. A piccolo drum is typically {{convert|20|in|cm|0}} in diameter and can reach pitches up to C<sub>4</sub>.\n\nBeyond this extended set of five instruments, any added drums are nonstandard. ([[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]]'s [[Al gran sole carico d'amore]] requires as many as eleven drums, with actual melodies played on them in octaves by two players.) Many professional orchestras and timpanists own more than just one set of timpani, allowing them to execute music that cannot be more accurately performed using a standard set of four or five drums. Many schools and [[youth orchestra]] ensembles unable to afford purchase of this equipment regularly rely on a set of two or three timpani, sometimes referred to as \"the orchestral three\".<ref name=grove/> It consists of {{convert|29|in|cm|0|adj=on}}, {{convert|26|in|cm|0|adj=on}}, and {{convert|23|in|cm|0|adj=on}} drums. Its range extends down only to F<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThe drums are set up in an arc around the performer. Traditionally, [[North America]]n, [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[France|French]] timpanists set their drums up with the lowest drum on the left and the highest on the right (commonly called the ''American'' system), while [[Germany|German]], [[Austria]]n, and [[Greeks|Greek]] players set them up in the reverse order, as to resemble a drum set or upright bass. (the ''German'' system).<ref name=grove/> This distinction is not strict, as many North American players use the German setup and vice versa.\n\n=== Players ===\n[[File:Balanced action timpani.jpg|thumb|left|Balanced action timpani are often used in outdoor performances because of their durability.]]\n\nThroughout their education, timpanists are trained as percussionists, and they learn to play all instruments of the percussion family along with timpani. However, when appointed to a principal timpani chair in a professional ensemble, a timpanist is not normally required to play any other instruments. In his book ''Anatomy of the Orchestra'', [[Norman Del Mar]] writes that the timpanist is \"king of his own province\", and that \"a good timpanist really does set the standard of the whole orchestra.\" A qualified member of the percussion section sometimes doubles as associate timpanist, performing in repertoire requiring multiple timpanists and filling in for the principal timpanist when required.\n\nAmong the professionals who have been highly regarded for their virtuosity and impact on the development of the timpani in the 20th century are [[Saul Goodman (percussionist)|Saul Goodman]], Hans Schnellar, Fred Hinger, and Cloyd Duff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wienerpauken.at/eng/history.php|title=Wiener Pauken - handmade timpani of Anton Mittermayr - timpani builder of Wiener Philharmoniker|website=www.wienerpauken.at}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pas.org/About/the-society/halloffame/HingerFred.aspx |title=Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame: Fred Hinger |access-date=2015-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618235937/http://www.pas.org/About/the-society/halloffame/HingerFred.aspx |archive-date=2015-06-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pas.org/About/the-society/halloffame/DuffCloyd.aspx|title=Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame: Cloyd Duff}}</ref>\n{{listen|filename=Richard_Strauss_-_Neal_O'Doan_-_Burleske.ogg|title=Burleske|description=[[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Burleske]]'' begins with the main theme played on the timpani.|format=[[ogg]]}}\n{{listen |\n | filename = Gustav Holst - the planets, op. 32 - iv. jupiter, the bringer of jollity (excerpt).ogg\n | title = \"Jupiter\" from ''The Planets'' suite (excerpt)\n | description = In the beginning of \"Jupiter\" from [[Gustav Holst|Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', the two timpanists echo the main theme.\n|}}\n\n=== Concertos ===\nA few solo [[concerto]]s have been written for timpani, and are for timpani and orchestral accompaniment. The 18th-century [[composer]] [[Johann Christian Fischer|Johann Fischer]] wrote a [[symphony]] for eight timpani and orchestra, which requires the solo timpanist to play eight drums simultaneously. Rough contemporaries [[Georg Druschetzky]] and [[Johann Melchior Molter]] also wrote pieces for timpani and orchestra. Throughout the 19th century and much of the 20th, there were few new timpani concertos. In 1983, [[William Kraft]], principal timpanist of the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], composed his ''Concerto for Timpani and Orchestra'', which won second prize in the [[Kennedy Center]] [[Friedheim Award]]s. There have been other timpani concertos, notably, [[Philip Glass]], considered one of the most influential composers of the late 20th century,<ref>{{citation |title=The Guardian Profile: Philip Glass |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4306156,00.html |date=November 24, 2001 |first=John |last=O'Mahony |accessdate=December 14, 2015 |periodical=[[The Guardian]] |postscript=<!--none--> |location=London}}</ref> wrote a double concerto at the behest of soloist Jonathan Haas titled ''[[Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra]]'', which features its soloists playing nine drums a piece.<ref name=\"philipglass.com\">[http://www.philipglass.com/music/compositions/concerto_fantasy_for_2_timpanists_orchestra.php \"Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520115410/http://www.philipglass.com/music/compositions/concerto_fantasy_for_2_timpanists_orchestra.php |date=2011-05-20 }}, ''Philip Glass Official Website''</ref>\n\n== Performance techniques ==\n\n=== Striking ===\nFor general playing, a timpanist will beat the head approximately {{convert|4|in|cm|0}} in from the edge.<ref name=goodman/> Beating at this spot produces the round, resonant sound commonly associated with timpani. A [[drum roll|timpani roll]] (most commonly signaled in a score by {{serif|''[[trill (music)|tr]]''}}) is executed by striking the timpani at varying velocities; the speed of the strokes are determined by the pitch of the drum, with higher pitched timpani requiring a quicker roll than timpani tuned to a lower pitch. While performing the timpani roll, mallets are usually held a few inches apart to create more sustain.<ref name=\"Timpani SBO\">{{cite magazine|last=Jones |first=Brett |date=November 19, 2013|title=Percussion Performance:Timpani|url=http://sbomagazine.com/current-issue/4578-percussion-performance-timpani.html|magazine=School Band and Orchestra |location=Las Vegas, Nevada|publisher=Timeless Communications |access-date=October 12, 2018}}</ref> [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7]] requires a continuous roll on a drum for over two and a half minutes. In general, timpanists do not use multiple bounce rolls like those played on the [[snare drum]], as the soft nature of timpani sticks causes the rebound of the stick to be reduced, causing multiple bounce rolls to sound muffled.<ref name=grove/>\n\nThe tone quality can be altered without switching sticks or adjusting the tuning. For example, by playing closer to the edge, the sound becomes thinner.<ref name=grove/> A more staccato sound can be produced by changing the velocity of the stroke or playing closer to the center.<ref name=\"Timpani SBO\"/>\n\n=== Tuning ===\nPrior to playing, the timpanist must clear the heads by equalizing the tension at each tuning screw. This is done so every spot is tuned to exactly the same pitch. When the head is clear, the timpani will produce an in-tune sound. If the head is not clear, the pitch will rise or fall after the initial impact of a stroke, and the drum will produce different pitches at different [[dynamics (music)|dynamic levels]]. Timpanists are required to have a well-developed sense of [[relative pitch]] and must develop techniques to tune in an undetectable manner and accurately in the middle of a performance. Tuning is often tested with a light tap from a finger, which produces a near-silent note.\n\nSome timpani are equipped with tuning gauges, which provide a visual indication of the pitch. They are physically connected either to the counterhoop, in which case the gauge indicates how far the counterhoop is pushed down, or the pedal, in which case the gauge indicates the position of the pedal. These gauges are accurate when used correctly. However, when the instrument is disturbed in some fashion (transported, for example), the overall pitch can change, thus the markers on the gauges may not remain reliable unless they have been adjusted immediately preceding the performance. The pitch can also be changed by room temperature and humidity. This effect also occurs due to changes in weather, especially if an outdoor performance is to take place. Gauges are especially useful when performing music that involves fast tuning changes that do not allow the timpanist to listen to the new pitch before playing it. Even when gauges are available, good timpanists will check their intonation by ear before playing. Occasionally, timpanists use the pedals to retune while playing.\n\n[[Portamento]] effects can be achieved by changing the pitch while it can still be heard. This is commonly called a ''[[glissando]]'', though this use of the term is not strictly correct. The most effective glissandos are those from low to high notes and those performed during rolls. One of the first composers to call for a timpani glissando was [[Carl Nielsen]], who used two sets of timpani playing glissandos at the same time in his [[Symphony No. 4 (Nielsen)|Symphony No. 4 (\"The Inextinguishable\")]].\n{{listen |\n | filename = Bart\u00f3k - Sonata for two pianos and percussion - Assai lento - Allegro molto (clip).ogg\n | title = Sonata for two pianos and percussion, first movement (excerpt)\n | description = This segment of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s Sonata for two pianos and percussion features pedal glissandos during a timpani roll.\n|}} ''Pedaling'' refers to changing the pitch with the pedal; it is an alternate term for ''tuning''. In general, timpanists reserve this term for passages where they must change the pitch in the midst of playing. Early 20th-century composers such as Nielsen, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Samuel Barber]], and [[Richard Strauss]] took advantage of the freedom that pedal timpani afforded, often giving the timpani the bass line.\n[[File:Bart\u00f3k - Concerto for Orchestra - Timpani pedaling.png|thumb|center|500px|This chromatic passage from the ''Intermezzo interrotto'' movement of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s [[Concerto for Orchestra (Bart\u00f3k)|Concerto for Orchestra]] requires the timpanist to use the pedals to play all the pitches. One way of executing this passage is annotated here: The lowest and highest drum stay on F and E{{music|flat}}, respectively. All pedaling is executed on the middle two drums. Each pedal change is indicated by a colored line: red for the larger and blue for the smaller of the middle drums.]]\n{{listen |\n | filename = Bart\u00f3k - Concerto for Orchestra (clip).ogg\n | title = Concerto for Orchestra (excerpt)\n | description = In this passage from the ''Intermezzo interrotto'' movement of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s [[Concerto for Orchestra (Bart\u00f3k)|Concerto for Orchestra]], the timpanist plays a chromatic bass line, which requires using the pedal to change pitches.\n|}}\n\n=== Muffling ===\nSince timpani have a long sustain, ''muffling'' or ''dampening'' is an inherent part of playing. Often, timpanists will muffle notes so they only sound for the length indicated by the composer. However, early timpani did not resonate nearly as long as modern timpani, so composers often wrote a note when the timpanist was to hit the drum without concern for sustain. Today, timpanists must use their ear and the [[Sheet music|score]] to determine the length the note should sound.\n\nThe typical method of muffling is to place the pads of the fingers against the head while holding onto the timpani stick with the thumb and index finger. Timpanists are required to develop techniques to stop all vibration without making any sound from the contact of their fingers.<ref name=goodman/>\n\nMuffling is often referred to as ''muting'', which can also refer to playing with mutes on them (''[[#Extended techniques|see below]]'').\n\n=== Extended techniques ===\nIt is typical for only one timpani to be struck at a time, but occasionally composers will ask for two notes. This is called a ''[[double stop]]'', a term borrowed from the [[string instrument]] vocabulary. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] uses this effect in the slow third movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], as do [[Johannes Brahms]] in the second movement of his [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|German Requiem]] and [[Aaron Copland]] in [[El Sal\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]]. Some modern composers occasionally require more than two notes. In this case, a timpanist can hold two sticks in one hand much like a [[marimba|marimb]]<nowiki/>ist, or more than one timpanist can be employed. In his Overture to ''[[Benvenuto Cellini (opera)|Benvenuto Cellini]]'', for example, [[Hector Berlioz]] realizes fully voiced chords from the timpani by requiring three timpanists and assigning one drum to each. He goes as far as ten timpanists playing three- and four-part chords on sixteen drums in his ''[[Requiem (Berlioz)|Requiem]]'', although with the introduction of pedal tuning, this number can be reduced.\n\nModern composers will often specify the beating spot to alter the sound of the drum. When the timpani are struck directly in the center, they have a sound that is almost completely devoid of tone and resonance. [[George Gershwin]] uses this effect in ''[[An American in Paris]]''. Struck close to the edge, timpani produce a very thin, hollow sound. This effect is used by composers such as Bart\u00f3k, Bernstein, and Kod\u00e1ly.\n\nA variation of this is to strike the head while two fingers of one hand lightly press and release spots near the center. The head will then vibrate at a [[harmonic]] much like the similar effect on a string instrument.\n\nResonance can cause timpani not in use to vibrate, causing a quieter sound to be produced. Timpanists must normally avoid this effect, called ''[[sympathetic resonance]]'', but composers have exploited it in solo pieces such as [[Elliott Carter]]'s ''[[Eight Pieces for Four Timpani]]''. Resonance is reduced by dampening or muting the drums, and in some cases composers will specify that timpani be played ''con sordino'' (''with mute'') or ''coperti'' (''covered''), both of which indicate that mutes\u2014typically small pieces of felt or leather\u2014should be placed on the head.\n\nComposers will sometimes specify that the timpani should struck with implements other than timpani sticks. It is common in timpani etudes and solos for timpanists to play with their hands or fingers. [[Philip Glass]]'s \"Concerto Fantasy\" utilizes this technique during a timpani cadenza. Also, [[Michael Daugherty]]'s \"Raise The Roof\" calls for this technique to be used for a certain passage. [[Leonard Bernstein]] calls for [[maraca]]s on timpani in the \"Jeremiah\" Symphony and Symphonic Dances from ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]''. [[Edward Elgar]] attempts to use the timpani to imitate the engine of an ocean liner in his [[Enigma Variations|\"Enigma\" Variations]] by requesting the timpanist play a soft roll with [[snare drum]] sticks. However, snare drum sticks tend to produce too loud a sound, and since this work's premiere, the passage has been performed by striking with coins. [[Benjamin Britten]] asks for the timpanist to use drumsticks in his ''[[War Requiem]]'' to evoke the sound of a field drum.\n\n[[Robert W. Smith (musician)|Robert W. Smith]]'s ''Songs of Sailor and Sea'' calls for a \"whale sound\" on the timpani. This is achieved by moistening the thumb and rubbing it from the edge to the center of the head. Among other techniques used primarily in solo work, such as John Beck's ''Sonata for Timpani'', is striking the bowls. Timpanists tend to be reluctant to strike the bowls at loud levels or with hard sticks since copper can be dented easily due to its soft nature.\n\nOn some occasions a composer may ask for a metal object, commonly an upside-down [[cymbal]], to be placed upon the head and then struck or rolled while executing a glissando on the drum. [[Joseph Schwantner]] used this technique in ''From A Dark Millennium''. [[Carl Orff]] asks for cymbals resting on the head while the drum is struck in his later works. Additionally, [[Michael Daugherty]], in his concerto \"Raise The Roof,\" utilizes this technique.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Early timpani and trumpet.jpg|thumb|In the 15th century, timpani were used with [[trumpet]]s as ceremonial instruments in the [[cavalry]].]]\n{{details|Evolution of Timpani in the 18th and 19th centuries}}\n\n=== Pre-orchestral history ===\nThe first recorded use of early Tympanum was in \"ancient times when it is known that they were used in religious ceremonies by Hebrews.\"<ref name=goodman/> The [[Moon of Pejeng]], also known as the ''Pejeng Moon'',<ref>For a thorough scholarly analysis of the Pejeng Moon and the type of drum named after it, see August Johan Bernet Kempers, \"The Pejeng type,\" ''The Kettledrums of Southeast Asia: A Bronze Age World and Its Aftermath'' (Taylor & Francis, 1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikSQw_-8gboC&pg=PA327&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=0_0#PPA327,M1 327]\u2013340.</ref> in [[Bali]], the largest single-cast bronze [[kettle drum]] in the world,<ref>Iain Stewart and Ryan Ver Berkmoes, ''Bali & Lombok'' (Lonely Planet, 2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=OY1puA2oNvUC&pg=PA203&dq=%22Moon+of+Pejeng%22+largest+drum&ei=ho-vSZ_nJJDCMu-GmJIF 203].</ref>  is more than two thousand years old.<ref>Yayasan Bumi Kita and Anne Gouyon, ''The Natural Guide to Bali: Enjoy Nature, Meet the People, Make a Difference'' (Tuttle Publishing, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=RzUPfuQ1GO0C&pg=PP111&dq=%22Moon+of+Pejeng%22+over+2000+years+old&ei=QpCvSZrgF5nMMt-SgF8#PPP111,M1 109].</ref>  The Moon of Pejeng is \"the largest known relic from Southeast Asia's [[Bronze Age]] period.\"<ref name=\"Pringle\">{{cite book| last = Pringle| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Pringle (diplomat)| title = Bali: Indonesia's Hindu Realm; A short history of| pages = 28\u201340| publisher = [[Allen & Unwin]]| series = Short History of Asia Series\n| year = 2004| doi = | isbn = 978-1-86508-863-1}}</ref> The drum is in the [[Pura Penataran Sasih]] temple.\"<ref>Rita A.

Some drums were tightened together by horses tugging from each side of the drum by the bolts. Over the next two centuries, a number of technical improvements were made to the timpani. Originally, the head was nailed directly to the shell of the drum. In the 15th century, heads began to be attached and tensioned by a counterhoop tied directly to the shell. In the early 16th century, the bindings were replaced by [[screw]]s. This allowed timpani to become tunable instruments of [[definite pitch]].<ref name=grove/> The [[Industrial Revolution]] enabled the introduction of new construction techniques and materials, in particular machine and pedal tuning mechanisms.

He not only wrote for drums tuned to intervals other than a fourth or fifth, but he gave a prominence to the instrument as an independent voice beyond programmatic use. For example, his [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] (1806) opens with four solo timpani strokes, and the [[scherzo]] of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] (1824) sets the timpani (tuned an octave apart) against the orchestra in a sort of [[Call and response (music)|call and response]].<ref name=krentzer>{{cite journal | last = Krentzer | first = Bill  |date=December 1969 | title = The Beethoven Symphonies: Innovations of an Original Style in Timpani Scoring | journal = Percussionist | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 55\u201362 | publisher = [[Percussive Arts Society]] }}</ref>\n\nThe next major innovator was [[Hector Berlioz]]. He was the first composer to indicate the exact sticks that should be used\u2014\"[[felt]]-covered\", \"wooden\", etc. In several of his works, including ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' (1830), and his ''[[Requiem (Berlioz)|Requiem]]'' (1837), he demanded the use of several timpanists at once.<ref name=goodman/>\n\nUntil the late 19th century, timpani were hand-tuned; that is, there was a sequence of screws with ''T''-shaped handles, called ''taps'', which altered the tension in the head when turned by players. Thus, tuning was a relatively slow operation, and composers had to allow a reasonable amount of time for players to change notes if they were called to tune in the middle of a work. The first 'machine' timpani, with a single tuning handle, was developed in 1812.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bowles |first=Edmund A. |year=1999 |title=The Impact of Technology on Musical Instruments |journal=COSMOS Journal |publisher=[[Cosmos Club]] |url=http://www.cosmos-club.org/web/journals/1999/bowles.html |accessdate=2008-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712070243/http://www.cosmos-club.org/web/journals/1999/bowles.html |archivedate=2014-07-12 }}</ref> The first pedal timpani originated in [[Dresden]] in the 1870s and are called ''Dresden'' timpani for this reason.<ref name=bridge/> However, since [[vellum]] was used for the heads of the drums, automated solutions were difficult to implement since the tension would vary unpredictably across the drum. This could be compensated for by hand-tuning, but not easily by a pedal drum. Mechanisms continued to improve in the early 20th century.\n\nDespite these problems, composers eagerly exploited the opportunities the new mechanism had to offer. By 1915, [[Carl Nielsen]] was demanding [[glissando]]s on timpani in his Fourth Symphony\u2014impossible on the old hand-tuned drums. However, it took [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] to more fully realize the flexibility the new mechanism had to offer. Many of his timpani parts require such a range of notes that it would be unthinkable to attempt them without pedal drums.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, timpani were almost always tuned with the [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] note of the piece on the low drum and the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] on the high drum\u2014a [[perfect fourth]] apart. Until the early 19th century the dominant (the note of the large drum) was written as G and the tonic (the note of the small drum) was written as C no matter what the actual key of the work was, and whether it was major or minor, with the actual pitches indicated at the top of the score (for example, ''Timpani in D\u2013A'' for a work in D major or D minor).<ref name = bridge/> This notation style however was not universal: Bach, Mozart, and Schubert (in his early works) used it, but their respective contemporaries Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven wrote for the timpani at concert pitch.<ref>{{cite book |first=Norman |last=Del Mar |title=The Anatomy of the Orchestra |publisher=University of California Press|year=1981}}{{Page needed|date=June 2012}}</ref> \n\nIn the 2010s, even though they are written at concert pitch, timpani parts continue to be most often<ref>See, as an early 20th-century example, the orchestral score of Debussy's [[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]: through no. 6 non-transposing parts have a key signature of one flat but the timpani part has no key signature, in bar 7 of no. 1 the timpani B{{music|flat}} is written in the staff; nos. 29 to 30 non-transposing parts have a key signature of four sharps but, again, the timpani part has no key signature, and so on.</ref> but not always<ref>For an example where this is not done, i.e. where the timpani part carries the same signature as all the other parts, see the orchestral score of Prokofiev's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Prokofiev)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] in D{{music|flat}} major, where, incidentally, transposing instrument parts are also written at concert pitch with the same key signature as all the other parts.</ref> written with no key signature, no matter what key the work is in: accidentals are written in the staff, both in the timpanist's part and the conductor's score.\n\n=== Outside the orchestra ===\n[[File:ML 1976 detail-timpani.jpg|thumb|This 1976 photograph shows marching timpani ''grounded'' with legs extended.]]\n[[File:John Bonham 1975.jpg|thumb|[[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]] with a timpano.]]\n\nLater, timpani were adopted into other classical music ensembles such as [[concert band]]s. In the 1970s, [[marching band]]s and [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|drum and bugle corps]], which evolved both from traditional marching bands and concert bands, began to include marching timpani. Unlike concert timpani, marching versions had fiberglass shells to make them light enough to carry. Each player carried a single drum, which was tuned by a hand crank. Often, during intricate passages, the timpani players would put their drums on the ground by means of extendable legs, and perform more like conventional timpani, yet with a single player per drum. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, marching arts-based organizations' allowance for timpani and other percussion instruments to be permanently grounded became mainstream. This was the beginning of the end for marching timpani: Eventually, standard concert timpani found their way onto the football field as part of the [[front ensemble]], and marching timpani fell out of common usage. Timpani are still used by the Mounted Bands of the [[Household Division]] of the [[British Army]]<ref>[[Beating Retreat]] page, showing image of mounted bands with timpani in 2008.</ref> and of the [[French_Republican_Guard_Band|Mounted Band]] of the [[Republican_Guard_(France)|''Garde R\u00e9publicaine'']] in the [[French Army]].\n\n<!-- need information about timpani in vaudeville and early jazz drum kits and such -->\nAs [[rock and roll]] bands started seeking to diversify their sound, timpani found their way into the studio. In 1959 Leiber and Stoller made the innovative use of timpani in their production of the Drifters' recording, \"There Goes My Baby.\" Starting in the 1960s, drummers for high-profile rock acts like [[The Beatles]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[The Beach Boys]], and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] incorporated timpani into their music.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McNamee |first1=David |title=Hey, what's that sound: Timpani |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/27/whats-that-sound-timpani |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=September 23, 2018|date=2009-04-27 }}</ref> This led to the use of timpani in [[progressive rock]]. [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]] recorded a number of rock covers of classical pieces that utilize timpani. [[Rush (band)|Rush]] drummer [[Neil Peart]] added a tympani to his expanding arsenal of percussion for the ''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]'' (1978) and ''[[Permanent Waves]]'' (1980) albums and tours, and would later sample tympani in his drum solo, \"The Rhythm Method\" in 1988. More recently, the rock band [[Muse (band)|Muse]] has incorporated timpani into some of their classically based songs, most notably in Exogenesis: Symphony, Part I (Overture). [[Jazz]] musicians also experimented with timpani. [[Sun Ra]] used it occasionally in his Arkestra (played, for example, by percussionist Jim Herndon on the songs \"Reflection in Blue\" and \"El Viktor,\" both recorded in 1957). In 1964, [[Elvin Jones]] incorporated timpani into his drum kit on [[John Coltrane]]'s four-part composition ''[[A Love Supreme]]''. [[Butch Trucks]], drummer with the [[Allman Brothers Band]] made use of the timpani. \n\nIn his choral piece [[A Stopwatch and an Ordnance Map]], [[Samuel Barber]] employs three pedal timpani upon which are played glissandos.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CFaAB8Tyxk</ref> \n\n[[Jonathan Haas]] is one of the few timpanists who markets himself as a soloist. Haas, who began his career as a solo timpanist in 1980, is notable for performing music from many genres including jazz, rock, and classical. He released an album with a rather unconventional jazz band called ''Johnny H. and the Prisoners of Swing''. Glass's ''Concerto Fantasy'', commissioned by Haas, put two soloists in ''front'' of the orchestra, an atypical placement for the instruments.<ref name=\"philipglass.com\"/> Haas also commissioned [[William Susman|Susman's]] ''Floating Falling'' for timpani and cello.<ref>[http://www.steveweissmusic.com/product/1129115/timpani-accompaniment \"Susman-Floating Falling\"], ''Steve Weiss Music''</ref>\n\n== List of famous solo works ==\n\n*\"Sonatina for Timpani\" by [[Alexander Tcherepnin]]\n*\"[[Eight Pieces for Four Timpani]]\" by [[Elliott Carter]]\n*\"Sonatina for Timpani\" by [[Alexander Tcherepnin]]\n*\"Concerto for Six Timpani\" by [[Georg Druschetzky]]\n*[[\"Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra\"|Concerto Fantasy for two Timpanists and Orchestra]] by [[Philip Glass]]\n*\"Concerto for Timpani and Orchestra Op.34\" by Werner Th\u00e4richen\n*''\"Konzertst\u00fcck'' for timpani and orchestra\" by [[Mauricio Kagel]]\n*\"Concerto for Timpani and Orchestra\" by [[William Kraft]]\n*\"Concerto for Timpani Op. 37\" by Ney Rosauro\n*\"Concertante per i bambini del mondo\" (for Timpani and Piano) by [[Luigi Morleo]]\n*\"Floating Falling for Timpani and Cello\" by [[William Susman]]\n\n== List of famous orchestral works ==\n*[[Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta]] by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]]\n*[[The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra]] by [[Benjamin Britten]]\n*Symphony for 2 Horns, 2 Violins, Viola, and Timpani by [[Christoph Graupner]]\n*Concerto for Wind Band, Timpani, and Orchestra by [[Gordon Jacob]]\n*[[Symphony No. 99]] by [[Johann Melchior Molter]]\n*[[Con brio (Widmann)|Con brio]] for Orchestra (and Timpani Soloist) by [[J\u00f6rg Widmann]]\n*Kurenti for Double bass and Timpani (1994) by Marko Ru\u017edjak\n*Planet Damnation (2012) by [[John Psathas]]\n*Animism (1995) by Steve Ridley\n*Suite from [[Na\u00efs]], Overture by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Electronic tuner]]\n* [[List of timpani manufacturers]]\n* [[Missing fundamental]]\n* [[Vibrations of a drum head]]\n* [[Davul]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Adler, Samuel.

A type of [[drum]] categorised as a [[semispherical drum]], they consist of a membrane called a [[drumhead|head]] stretched over a large bowl traditionally made of [[copper]]. Most modern timpani are ''pedal timpani'' and can be tuned quickly and accurately to specific pitches by skilled players through the use of a movable foot-pedal. They are played by striking the head with a specialized [[drum stick]] called a ''timpani stick'' or ''timpani mallet''. Timpani evolved from [[military drums]] to become a staple of the [[European classical music|classical]] [[orchestra]] by the last third of the 18th century. Today, they are used in many types of [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]]s, including [[concert band]]s, [[marching band]]s, [[orchestra]]s, and even in some [[rock bands]].\n\n''Timpani'' is an [[Italian language|Italian]] plural, the singular of which is ''timpano''. However, in [[English language|English]] the term timpano is only widely in use by practitioners: several are more typically referred to collectively as ''kettledrums'', ''timpani'', ''temple drums'', ''timp-toms'', or ''timps''. They are also often incorrectly termed ''timpanis''. A [[musician]] who plays timpani is a ''timpanist''.\n\n==Etymology and alternative spellings==\nFirst attested in English in the late 19th century, the Italian word ''timpani'' derives from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[Tympanum (hand drum)|tympanum]]'' (pl.

In the [[Sachs\u2013Hornbostel|Sachs\u2013Hornbostel classification]], this makes timpani [[membranophone]]s. The head is affixed to a [[wikt:hoop|hoop]] (also called a ''flesh hoop''),<ref name=grove/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flesh%20hoop|title=Definition of FLESH HOOP|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-13}}</ref> which in turn is held onto the bowl by a ''counter hoop''.<ref name=grove/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/counter%20hoop|title=Definition of COUNTER HOOP|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-13}}</ref> The counter hoop is usually held in place with a number of tuning [[screw (simple machine)|screw]]s called ''tension rods'' placed regularly around the circumference. The head's tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Most timpani have six to eight tension rods.<ref name=bridge/>\n\nThe shape and material of the bowl's surface help to determine the drum's [[timbre]]. For example, [[Sphere|hemispheric]] bowls produce brighter tones while [[Parabola|parabolic]] bowls produce darker tones.<ref name=power>{{cite journal | last = Power | first = Andrew |date=April 1983 | title = Sound Production of the Timpani, Part 1 | journal = Percussive Notes | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 62\u201364 | publisher = [[Percussive Arts Society]] }}</ref> Modern timpani are generally made with copper due to its efficient regulation of internal and external temperatures relative to aluminum and fiberglass.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Richard K. |title=In Search of the Missing Fundamental |url=https://wtt.pauken.org/?page_id=6785 |website=The Well-Tempered Timpani |accessdate=September 23, 2018 |date=March 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Timpani setup.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Walter Light]] [[#Pedal timpani|pedal]] and [[#Chain timpani|chain]] timpani set up in three different combinations.]]\nTimpani come in a variety of sizes from about {{convert|84|cm|in|order=flip}} in diameter down to ''piccoli timpani'' of {{convert|30|cm|in|order=flip}} or less.<ref name=grove/> A 33-inch drum can produce C<sub>2</sub> (the C below the [[bass clef]]), and specialty piccoli timpani can play up into the [[treble clef]].

In the late 19th century, mechanical systems to change the tension of the entire head at once were developed. Any timpani equipped with such a system may be considered ''machine timpani'', although this term commonly refers to drums that use a handle connected to a spider-type tuning mechanism.<ref name=bridge/>\n\n==== Pedal timpani ====\nBy far the most common type of timpani used today are pedal timpani, which allows the tension of the head to be adjusted using a pedal mechanism. Typically, the pedal is connected to the tension screws via an assembly of either [[cast metal]] or metal rods called the ''spider''.\n\n[[File:Dresden pedal.jpg|thumb|left|A pedal on a ''Dresden'' timpano\u2014the clutch (seen here on the left) must be disengaged to change the pitch of the drum.]]\n[[File:Timpani, Yamaha pedal timpani.jpg|thumb|The inside, bottom of a Yamaha pedal timpano, showing the mechanical tension-adjusting system]]\nThere are three types of pedal mechanisms in common use today:\n* The ''ratchet clutch'' system uses a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet and pawl]] to hold the pedal in place. The timpanist must first disengage the clutch before using the pedal to tune the drum. When the desired pitch is achieved, the timpanist must then reengage the clutch. Because the ratchet engages in only a fixed set of positions, the timpanist must fine-tune the drum by means of a fine-tuning handle.\n* In the ''balanced action'' system, a spring or [[hydraulic cylinder]] is used to balance the tension on the head so the pedal will stay in position and the head will stay at pitch. The pedal on a balanced action drum is sometimes called a ''floating pedal'' since there is no clutch holding it in place.\n* The ''friction clutch'' or ''post and clutch'' system uses a clutch that moves along a post. Disengaging the clutch frees it from the post, allowing the pedal to move without restraint.\n\nProfessional-level timpani use either the ratchet or friction system and have copper bowls. These drums can have one of two styles of pedals. The ''Dresden'' pedal is attached at the side nearest the timpanist and is operated by ankle motion. A ''Berlin''-style pedal is attached by means of a long arm to the opposite side of the timpani, and the timpanist must use his entire leg to adjust the pitch. In addition to a pedal, high-end instruments have a hand-operated fine-tuner, which allows the timpanist to make minute pitch adjustments. The pedal is on either the left or right side of the drum depending on the direction of the setup.\n\nMost school bands and orchestras below a [[university]] level use less expensive, more durable timpani with copper, fiberglass, or aluminum bowls. The mechanical parts of these instruments are almost completely contained within the frame and bowl. They may use any of the pedal mechanisms, though the balanced action system is by far the most common, followed by the friction clutch system. Many professionals also use these drums for outdoor performances due to their durability and lighter weight. The pedal is in the center of the drum itself.\n\n=== Chain timpani ===\n[[File:Chain timpani.jpg|thumb|220px|On chain timpani, a chain links the tension rods so a master handle can be used to turn them all at once.]]\nOn ''chain timpani'', the tension rods are connected by a [[roller chain]] much like the one found on a [[bicycle]], though some manufacturers have used other materials, including [[Wire rope|steel cable]]. In these systems, all the tension screws can then be tightened or loosened by one handle. Though far less common than pedal timpani, chain and cable drums still have practical uses. Occasionally, a timpanist is forced to place a drum behind other items, so he cannot reach it with his foot. Professionals may also use exceptionally large or small chain and cable drums for special low or high notes.\n\n=== Other tuning mechanisms ===\nA rare tuning mechanism allows the pitch to be changed by rotating the drum itself. A similar system is used on [[rototom]]s. Jenco, a company better known for [[Percussion instrument|mallet percussion]], made timpani tuned in this fashion.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Hans Schnellar, the timpanist of the [[Vienna Philharmonic]], developed a tuning mechanism in which the bowl is moved via a handle that connects to the base and the head remains stationary. These instruments are referred to as ''Viennese timpani'' (''Wiener Pauken'') or ''Schnellar timpani''.<ref>[http://drtrumpet.eu/MB-PDF/2001e_MB_ISMA_timpani.pdf Vibration patterns and sound analysis of the Viennese Timpani]. Bertsch, Matthias. (2001), Proceedings of ISMA 2001</ref> [[Adams Musical Instruments]] developed a pedal-operated version of this tuning mechanism in the early 21st century.\n\n=== Heads ===\nLike most [[drumhead]]s, timpani heads can be made from two materials: animal [[skin]] (typically [[calfskin]] or [[goatskin (material)|goatskin]])<ref name=grove/> or [[plastic]] (typically [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]]). Plastic heads are durable, weather-resistant, and relatively inexpensive. Thus, they are more commonly used than skin heads. However, many professional timpanists prefer skin heads because they produce a \"warmer\" [[timbre]]. Timpani heads are determined based on the size of the head, not the bowl. For example, a {{convert|23|in|cm|adj=on}} drum may require a {{convert|25|in|cm|adj=on}} head. This {{convert|2|in|cm|0|adj=on}} size difference has been standardized by most timpani manufacturers since 1978.<ref>[http://www.steveweissmusic.com/product/timpani_head_size/articles \"Timpani Head Guide\"], ''Steve Weiss Music''</ref>\n\n== Sticks and mallets ==\n[[File:Timpani sticks.jpg|thumb|Timpanists use a variety of timpani sticks since each produces a different [[timbre]].]]\nTimpani are typically struck with a special type of [[drum stick]] called a ''timpani stick'' or ''timpani mallet''. Timpani sticks are used in pairs. They have two components: a shaft and a head. The shaft is typically made from [[hardwood]] or [[bamboo]] but may also be made from [[aluminum]] or [[carbon fiber]]. The head can be constructed from a number of different materials, though [[felt]] wrapped around a wooden core is the most common. Other core materials include compressed felt, [[Cork (material)|cork]], and [[leather]].<ref name=\"Of Music\">{{cite book |last1=Kallen |first1=Stuart |title=The Instruments of Music |date=2003 |publisher=Lucent Books |location=Farmington Hills, MI |isbn=978-1-59018-127-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/musiclibraryi00stua/page/24 24] |chapter-url=http://www.gale.com |accessdate=October 31, 2018 |chapter=One |url=https://archive.org/details/musiclibraryi00stua/page/24 }}</ref> Unwrapped sticks with heads of wood, felt, flannel, and leather are also common.<ref name=grove/> Wooden sticks are used as a special effect<ref>{{cite web |title=T5 Wood |url=http://vicfirth.com/products/band-orchestra/timpani-mallets/t5-wood/ |website=Vic Firth |accessdate=October 31, 2018}}</ref>\u2014specifically requested by composers as early as the Romantic era\u2014and in [[Historically informed performance|authentic performances]] of [[Baroque music]]. Wooden timpani sticks are also occasionally used to play the suspended cymbal.\n\nAlthough not usually stated in the score (excepting the occasional request to use wooden sticks), timpanists will change sticks to suit the nature of the music. However, the choice during a performance is subjective and depends on the timpanist's preference and occasionally the wishes of the conductor. Thus, most timpanists own a great number of sticks.<ref name=grove/> The weight of the stick, size and latent surface area of the head, materials used for the shaft, core, and wrap, and method used to wrap the head all contribute to the timbre the stick produces.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XexFFphAE0 Slow Motion of Timpani Technique | Percussion Research]. Retrieved 7 December 2012.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century and before, sticks were often made with whalebone shafts, wooden cores, and sponge wraps. Composers of that era often specified sponge-headed sticks. Modern timpanists execute such passages with felt sticks.\n\n== Popular grips ==\nThe two most common grips in playing the timpani are the [[Matched grip#German grip|German]] and [[Matched grip#French grip|French]] grips. In the German grip, the palm of the hand is approximately parallel with the drum head and the thumb should be on the side of the stick. In the French grip, the palm of the hand is approximately perpendicular with drum head and the thumb is on top of the stick. In both of these styles, the fulcrum is the contact between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger is used as a guide and to help lift the stick off of the drum.<ref name=\"Stewart Hoffman\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stewarthoffmanmusic.com/articles-percussion-techniques.php?id=47|title=Playing Timpani &#124; Timpani Techniques &#124; High School Percussion|last=Hoffman|first=Stewart|publisher=Stewart Hoffman Music|location=Toronto, ON|work=stewarthoffmanmusic.com|accessdate=August 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424225920/http://www.stewarthoffmanmusic.com/articles-percussion-techniques.php?id=47|archive-date=April 24, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The [[Matched grip#American grip|American]] grip is a hybrid of these two grips. Another known grip is known as the Amsterdam Grip, made famous by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, which is similar to the Hinger grip, except the stick is cradled on the lower knuckle of the index finger.\n\n== In the modern ensemble ==\n[[File:Standard timpani setup.jpg|thumb|left|A standard set of timpani consists of four drums.]]\n\n=== Standard set ===\nA standard set of timpani (sometimes called a console) consists of four drums: roughly {{convert|32|in|cm|0}}, {{convert|29|in|cm|0}}, {{convert|26|in|cm|0}}, and {{convert|23|in|cm|0}} in diameter.<ref name=goodman>{{cite book|last=Goodman |first=Saul |authorlink=Saul Goodman |title=Modern Method for Tympani |origyear=1948 |year=1988 |publisher=[[Alfred Publishing|Alfred Publishing Company, Inc.]] |location=[[Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California|Van Nuys]], [[California]] |isbn=978-0-7579-9100-4}}</ref> The range of this set is roughly [[scientific pitch notation|D<sub>2</sub> to A<sub>3</sub>]]. A great majority of the orchestral repertoire can be played using these four drums. However, contemporary composers have written for extended ranges. [[Igor Stravinsky]] specifically writes for a ''piccolo timpano'' in ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', tuned to B<sub>3</sub>. A piccolo drum is typically {{convert|20|in|cm|0}} in diameter and can reach pitches up to C<sub>4</sub>.\n\nBeyond this extended set of five instruments, any added drums are nonstandard. ([[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]]'s [[Al gran sole carico d'amore]] requires as many as eleven drums, with actual melodies played on them in octaves by two players.) Many professional orchestras and timpanists own more than just one set of timpani, allowing them to execute music that cannot be more accurately performed using a standard set of four or five drums. Many schools and [[youth orchestra]] ensembles unable to afford purchase of this equipment regularly rely on a set of two or three timpani, sometimes referred to as \"the orchestral three\".<ref name=grove/> It consists of {{convert|29|in|cm|0|adj=on}}, {{convert|26|in|cm|0|adj=on}}, and {{convert|23|in|cm|0|adj=on}} drums. Its range extends down only to F<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThe drums are set up in an arc around the performer. Traditionally, [[North America]]n, [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[France|French]] timpanists set their drums up with the lowest drum on the left and the highest on the right (commonly called the ''American'' system), while [[Germany|German]], [[Austria]]n, and [[Greeks|Greek]] players set them up in the reverse order, as to resemble a drum set or upright bass. (the ''German'' system).<ref name=grove/> This distinction is not strict, as many North American players use the German setup and vice versa.\n\n=== Players ===\n[[File:Balanced action timpani.jpg|thumb|left|Balanced action timpani are often used in outdoor performances because of their durability.]]\n\nThroughout their education, timpanists are trained as percussionists, and they learn to play all instruments of the percussion family along with timpani. However, when appointed to a principal timpani chair in a professional ensemble, a timpanist is not normally required to play any other instruments. In his book ''Anatomy of the Orchestra'', [[Norman Del Mar]] writes that the timpanist is \"king of his own province\", and that \"a good timpanist really does set the standard of the whole orchestra.\" A qualified member of the percussion section sometimes doubles as associate timpanist, performing in repertoire requiring multiple timpanists and filling in for the principal timpanist when required.\n\nAmong the professionals who have been highly regarded for their virtuosity and impact on the development of the timpani in the 20th century are [[Saul Goodman (percussionist)|Saul Goodman]], Hans Schnellar, Fred Hinger, and Cloyd Duff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wienerpauken.at/eng/history.php|title=Wiener Pauken - handmade timpani of Anton Mittermayr - timpani builder of Wiener Philharmoniker|website=www.wienerpauken.at}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pas.org/About/the-society/halloffame/HingerFred.aspx |title=Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame: Fred Hinger |access-date=2015-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618235937/http://www.pas.org/About/the-society/halloffame/HingerFred.aspx |archive-date=2015-06-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pas.org/About/the-society/halloffame/DuffCloyd.aspx|title=Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame: Cloyd Duff}}</ref>\n{{listen|filename=Richard_Strauss_-_Neal_O'Doan_-_Burleske.ogg|title=Burleske|description=[[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Burleske]]'' begins with the main theme played on the timpani.|format=[[ogg]]}}\n{{listen |\n | filename = Gustav Holst - the planets, op. 32 - iv. jupiter, the bringer of jollity (excerpt).ogg\n | title = \"Jupiter\" from ''The Planets'' suite (excerpt)\n | description = In the beginning of \"Jupiter\" from [[Gustav Holst|Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', the two timpanists echo the main theme.\n|}}\n\n=== Concertos ===\nA few solo [[concerto]]s have been written for timpani, and are for timpani and orchestral accompaniment. The 18th-century [[composer]] [[Johann Christian Fischer|Johann Fischer]] wrote a [[symphony]] for eight timpani and orchestra, which requires the solo timpanist to play eight drums simultaneously. Rough contemporaries [[Georg Druschetzky]] and [[Johann Melchior Molter]] also wrote pieces for timpani and orchestra. Throughout the 19th century and much of the 20th, there were few new timpani concertos. In 1983, [[William Kraft]], principal timpanist of the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], composed his ''Concerto for Timpani and Orchestra'', which won second prize in the [[Kennedy Center]] [[Friedheim Award]]s. There have been other timpani concertos, notably, [[Philip Glass]], considered one of the most influential composers of the late 20th century,<ref>{{citation |title=The Guardian Profile: Philip Glass |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4306156,00.html |date=November 24, 2001 |first=John |last=O'Mahony |accessdate=December 14, 2015 |periodical=[[The Guardian]] |postscript=<!--none--> |location=London}}</ref> wrote a double concerto at the behest of soloist Jonathan Haas titled ''[[Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra]]'', which features its soloists playing nine drums a piece.<ref name=\"philipglass.com\">[http://www.philipglass.com/music/compositions/concerto_fantasy_for_2_timpanists_orchestra.php \"Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520115410/http://www.philipglass.com/music/compositions/concerto_fantasy_for_2_timpanists_orchestra.php |date=2011-05-20 }}, ''Philip Glass Official Website''</ref>\n\n== Performance techniques ==\n\n=== Striking ===\nFor general playing, a timpanist will beat the head approximately {{convert|4|in|cm|0}} in from the edge.<ref name=goodman/> Beating at this spot produces the round, resonant sound commonly associated with timpani. A [[drum roll|timpani roll]] (most commonly signaled in a score by {{serif|''[[trill (music)|tr]]''}}) is executed by striking the timpani at varying velocities; the speed of the strokes are determined by the pitch of the drum, with higher pitched timpani requiring a quicker roll than timpani tuned to a lower pitch. While performing the timpani roll, mallets are usually held a few inches apart to create more sustain.<ref name=\"Timpani SBO\">{{cite magazine|last=Jones |first=Brett |date=November 19, 2013|title=Percussion Performance:Timpani|url=http://sbomagazine.com/current-issue/4578-percussion-performance-timpani.html|magazine=School Band and Orchestra |location=Las Vegas, Nevada|publisher=Timeless Communications |access-date=October 12, 2018}}</ref> [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7]] requires a continuous roll on a drum for over two and a half minutes. In general, timpanists do not use multiple bounce rolls like those played on the [[snare drum]], as the soft nature of timpani sticks causes the rebound of the stick to be reduced, causing multiple bounce rolls to sound muffled.<ref name=grove/>\n\nThe tone quality can be altered without switching sticks or adjusting the tuning. For example, by playing closer to the edge, the sound becomes thinner.<ref name=grove/> A more staccato sound can be produced by changing the velocity of the stroke or playing closer to the center.<ref name=\"Timpani SBO\"/>\n\n=== Tuning ===\nPrior to playing, the timpanist must clear the heads by equalizing the tension at each tuning screw. This is done so every spot is tuned to exactly the same pitch. When the head is clear, the timpani will produce an in-tune sound. If the head is not clear, the pitch will rise or fall after the initial impact of a stroke, and the drum will produce different pitches at different [[dynamics (music)|dynamic levels]]. Timpanists are required to have a well-developed sense of [[relative pitch]] and must develop techniques to tune in an undetectable manner and accurately in the middle of a performance. Tuning is often tested with a light tap from a finger, which produces a near-silent note.\n\nSome timpani are equipped with tuning gauges, which provide a visual indication of the pitch. They are physically connected either to the counterhoop, in which case the gauge indicates how far the counterhoop is pushed down, or the pedal, in which case the gauge indicates the position of the pedal. These gauges are accurate when used correctly. However, when the instrument is disturbed in some fashion (transported, for example), the overall pitch can change, thus the markers on the gauges may not remain reliable unless they have been adjusted immediately preceding the performance. The pitch can also be changed by room temperature and humidity. This effect also occurs due to changes in weather, especially if an outdoor performance is to take place. Gauges are especially useful when performing music that involves fast tuning changes that do not allow the timpanist to listen to the new pitch before playing it. Even when gauges are available, good timpanists will check their intonation by ear before playing. Occasionally, timpanists use the pedals to retune while playing.\n\n[[Portamento]] effects can be achieved by changing the pitch while it can still be heard. This is commonly called a ''[[glissando]]'', though this use of the term is not strictly correct. The most effective glissandos are those from low to high notes and those performed during rolls. One of the first composers to call for a timpani glissando was [[Carl Nielsen]], who used two sets of timpani playing glissandos at the same time in his [[Symphony No. 4 (Nielsen)|Symphony No. 4 (\"The Inextinguishable\")]].\n{{listen |\n | filename = Bart\u00f3k - Sonata for two pianos and percussion - Assai lento - Allegro molto (clip).ogg\n | title = Sonata for two pianos and percussion, first movement (excerpt)\n | description = This segment of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s Sonata for two pianos and percussion features pedal glissandos during a timpani roll.\n|}} ''Pedaling'' refers to changing the pitch with the pedal; it is an alternate term for ''tuning''. In general, timpanists reserve this term for passages where they must change the pitch in the midst of playing. Early 20th-century composers such as Nielsen, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Samuel Barber]], and [[Richard Strauss]] took advantage of the freedom that pedal timpani afforded, often giving the timpani the bass line.\n[[File:Bart\u00f3k - Concerto for Orchestra - Timpani pedaling.png|thumb|center|500px|This chromatic passage from the ''Intermezzo interrotto'' movement of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s [[Concerto for Orchestra (Bart\u00f3k)|Concerto for Orchestra]] requires the timpanist to use the pedals to play all the pitches. One way of executing this passage is annotated here: The lowest and highest drum stay on F and E{{music|flat}}, respectively. All pedaling is executed on the middle two drums. Each pedal change is indicated by a colored line: red for the larger and blue for the smaller of the middle drums.]]\n{{listen |\n | filename = Bart\u00f3k - Concerto for Orchestra (clip).ogg\n | title = Concerto for Orchestra (excerpt)\n | description = In this passage from the ''Intermezzo interrotto'' movement of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s [[Concerto for Orchestra (Bart\u00f3k)|Concerto for Orchestra]], the timpanist plays a chromatic bass line, which requires using the pedal to change pitches.\n|}}\n\n=== Muffling ===\nSince timpani have a long sustain, ''muffling'' or ''dampening'' is an inherent part of playing. Often, timpanists will muffle notes so they only sound for the length indicated by the composer. However, early timpani did not resonate nearly as long as modern timpani, so composers often wrote a note when the timpanist was to hit the drum without concern for sustain. Today, timpanists must use their ear and the [[Sheet music|score]] to determine the length the note should sound.\n\nThe typical method of muffling is to place the pads of the fingers against the head while holding onto the timpani stick with the thumb and index finger. Timpanists are required to develop techniques to stop all vibration without making any sound from the contact of their fingers.<ref name=goodman/>\n\nMuffling is often referred to as ''muting'', which can also refer to playing with mutes on them (''[[#Extended techniques|see below]]'').\n\n=== Extended techniques ===\nIt is typical for only one timpani to be struck at a time, but occasionally composers will ask for two notes. This is called a ''[[double stop]]'', a term borrowed from the [[string instrument]] vocabulary. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] uses this effect in the slow third movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], as do [[Johannes Brahms]] in the second movement of his [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|German Requiem]] and [[Aaron Copland]] in [[El Sal\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]]. Some modern composers occasionally require more than two notes. In this case, a timpanist can hold two sticks in one hand much like a [[marimba|marimb]]<nowiki/>ist, or more than one timpanist can be employed. In his Overture to ''[[Benvenuto Cellini (opera)|Benvenuto Cellini]]'', for example, [[Hector Berlioz]] realizes fully voiced chords from the timpani by requiring three timpanists and assigning one drum to each. He goes as far as ten timpanists playing three- and four-part chords on sixteen drums in his ''[[Requiem (Berlioz)|Requiem]]'', although with the introduction of pedal tuning, this number can be reduced.\n\nModern composers will often specify the beating spot to alter the sound of the drum. When the timpani are struck directly in the center, they have a sound that is almost completely devoid of tone and resonance. [[George Gershwin]] uses this effect in ''[[An American in Paris]]''. Struck close to the edge, timpani produce a very thin, hollow sound. This effect is used by composers such as Bart\u00f3k, Bernstein, and Kod\u00e1ly.\n\nA variation of this is to strike the head while two fingers of one hand lightly press and release spots near the center. The head will then vibrate at a [[harmonic]] much like the similar effect on a string instrument.\n\nResonance can cause timpani not in use to vibrate, causing a quieter sound to be produced. Timpanists must normally avoid this effect, called ''[[sympathetic resonance]]'', but composers have exploited it in solo pieces such as [[Elliott Carter]]'s ''[[Eight Pieces for Four Timpani]]''. Resonance is reduced by dampening or muting the drums, and in some cases composers will specify that timpani be played ''con sordino'' (''with mute'') or ''coperti'' (''covered''), both of which indicate that mutes\u2014typically small pieces of felt or leather\u2014should be placed on the head.\n\nComposers will sometimes specify that the timpani should struck with implements other than timpani sticks. It is common in timpani etudes and solos for timpanists to play with their hands or fingers. [[Philip Glass]]'s \"Concerto Fantasy\" utilizes this technique during a timpani cadenza. Also, [[Michael Daugherty]]'s \"Raise The Roof\" calls for this technique to be used for a certain passage. [[Leonard Bernstein]] calls for [[maraca]]s on timpani in the \"Jeremiah\" Symphony and Symphonic Dances from ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]''. [[Edward Elgar]] attempts to use the timpani to imitate the engine of an ocean liner in his [[Enigma Variations|\"Enigma\" Variations]] by requesting the timpanist play a soft roll with [[snare drum]] sticks. However, snare drum sticks tend to produce too loud a sound, and since this work's premiere, the passage has been performed by striking with coins. [[Benjamin Britten]] asks for the timpanist to use drumsticks in his ''[[War Requiem]]'' to evoke the sound of a field drum.\n\n[[Robert W. Smith (musician)|Robert W. Smith]]'s ''Songs of Sailor and Sea'' calls for a \"whale sound\" on the timpani. This is achieved by moistening the thumb and rubbing it from the edge to the center of the head. Among other techniques used primarily in solo work, such as John Beck's ''Sonata for Timpani'', is striking the bowls. Timpanists tend to be reluctant to strike the bowls at loud levels or with hard sticks since copper can be dented easily due to its soft nature.\n\nOn some occasions a composer may ask for a metal object, commonly an upside-down [[cymbal]], to be placed upon the head and then struck or rolled while executing a glissando on the drum. [[Joseph Schwantner]] used this technique in ''From A Dark Millennium''. [[Carl Orff]] asks for cymbals resting on the head while the drum is struck in his later works. Additionally, [[Michael Daugherty]], in his concerto \"Raise The Roof,\" utilizes this technique.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Early timpani and trumpet.jpg|thumb|In the 15th century, timpani were used with [[trumpet]]s as ceremonial instruments in the [[cavalry]].]]\n{{details|Evolution of Timpani in the 18th and 19th centuries}}\n\n=== Pre-orchestral history ===\nThe first recorded use of early Tympanum was in \"ancient times when it is known that they were used in religious ceremonies by Hebrews.\"<ref name=goodman/> The [[Moon of Pejeng]], also known as the ''Pejeng Moon'',<ref>For a thorough scholarly analysis of the Pejeng Moon and the type of drum named after it, see August Johan Bernet Kempers, \"The Pejeng type,\" ''The Kettledrums of Southeast Asia: A Bronze Age World and Its Aftermath'' (Taylor & Francis, 1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikSQw_-8gboC&pg=PA327&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=0_0#PPA327,M1 327]\u2013340.</ref> in [[Bali]], the largest single-cast bronze [[kettle drum]] in the world,<ref>Iain Stewart and Ryan Ver Berkmoes, ''Bali & Lombok'' (Lonely Planet, 2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=OY1puA2oNvUC&pg=PA203&dq=%22Moon+of+Pejeng%22+largest+drum&ei=ho-vSZ_nJJDCMu-GmJIF 203].</ref>  is more than two thousand years old.<ref>Yayasan Bumi Kita and Anne Gouyon, ''The Natural Guide to Bali: Enjoy Nature, Meet the People, Make a Difference'' (Tuttle Publishing, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=RzUPfuQ1GO0C&pg=PP111&dq=%22Moon+of+Pejeng%22+over+2000+years+old&ei=QpCvSZrgF5nMMt-SgF8#PPP111,M1 109].</ref>  The Moon of Pejeng is \"the largest known relic from Southeast Asia's [[Bronze Age]] period.\"<ref name=\"Pringle\">{{cite book| last = Pringle| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Pringle (diplomat)| title = Bali: Indonesia's Hindu Realm; A short history of| pages = 28\u201340| publisher = [[Allen & Unwin]]| series = Short History of Asia Series\n| year = 2004| doi = | isbn = 978-1-86508-863-1}}</ref> The drum is in the [[Pura Penataran Sasih]] temple.\"<ref>Rita A.

Some drums were tightened together by horses tugging from each side of the drum by the bolts. Over the next two centuries, a number of technical improvements were made to the timpani. Originally, the head was nailed directly to the shell of the drum. In the 15th century, heads began to be attached and tensioned by a counterhoop tied directly to the shell. In the early 16th century, the bindings were replaced by [[screw]]s. This allowed timpani to become tunable instruments of [[definite pitch]].<ref name=grove/> The [[Industrial Revolution]] enabled the introduction of new construction techniques and materials, in particular machine and pedal tuning mechanisms. Plastic heads were introduced in the mid-20th century, led by [[Remo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://remo.com/company/ |title=Company |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= |publisher=Remo Inc. |access-date=2016-05-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Role in orchestra ===\n{{details|Evolution of Timpani in the 18th and 19th centuries}}\n\n\"No written kettledrum music survives from the 16th century, because the technique and repertory were learned by oral tradition and were kept secret. An early example of trumpet and kettledrum music occurs at the beginning of Monteverdi\u2019s opera ''Orfeo'' (1607).\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Kettledrum; Musical Instrument |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2014-08-19 |url=http://www.britannica.com/art/kettledrum |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> Later in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] wrote a secular [[cantata]] titled ''[[T\u00f6net, ihr Pauken! Erschallet, Trompeten!]]'', which translates roughly to \"Sound off, ye timpani! Sound, trumpets!\" Naturally, the timpani are placed at the forefront: the piece starts with an unusual timpani solo and the chorus and timpani trade the melody back and forth. Bach reworked this movement in ''[[Jauchzet, frohlocket! BWV 248 I|Part I]] of the [[Christmas Oratorio]].\n[[File:City trumpeteers.jpg|thumb|Although by the early 19th century, timpani were most commonly found in orchestras, ceremonial trumpet and timpani ensembles still existed.]] \n[[Mozart]] and [[Haydn]] wrote many works for the timpani and even started putting it in their symphonies.\n\n[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] revolutionized timpani music in the early 19th century. He not only wrote for drums tuned to intervals other than a fourth or fifth, but he gave a prominence to the instrument as an independent voice beyond programmatic use. For example, his [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] (1806) opens with four solo timpani strokes, and the [[scherzo]] of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] (1824) sets the timpani (tuned an octave apart) against the orchestra in a sort of [[Call and response (music)|call and response]].<ref name=krentzer>{{cite journal | last = Krentzer | first = Bill  |date=December 1969 | title = The Beethoven Symphonies: Innovations of an Original Style in Timpani Scoring | journal = Percussionist | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 55\u201362 | publisher = [[Percussive Arts Society]] }}</ref>\n\nThe next major innovator was [[Hector Berlioz]]. He was the first composer to indicate the exact sticks that should be used\u2014\"[[felt]]-covered\", \"wooden\", etc. In several of his works, including ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' (1830), and his ''[[Requiem (Berlioz)|Requiem]]'' (1837), he demanded the use of several timpanists at once.<ref name=goodman/>\n\nUntil the late 19th century, timpani were hand-tuned; that is, there was a sequence of screws with ''T''-shaped handles, called ''taps'', which altered the tension in the head when turned by players. Thus, tuning was a relatively slow operation, and composers had to allow a reasonable amount of time for players to change notes if they were called to tune in the middle of a work. The first 'machine' timpani, with a single tuning handle, was developed in 1812.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bowles |first=Edmund A. |year=1999 |title=The Impact of Technology on Musical Instruments |journal=COSMOS Journal |publisher=[[Cosmos Club]] |url=http://www.cosmos-club.org/web/journals/1999/bowles.html |accessdate=2008-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712070243/http://www.cosmos-club.org/web/journals/1999/bowles.html |archivedate=2014-07-12 }}</ref> The first pedal timpani originated in [[Dresden]] in the 1870s and are called ''Dresden'' timpani for this reason.<ref name=bridge/> However, since [[vellum]] was used for the heads of the drums, automated solutions were difficult to implement since the tension would vary unpredictably across the drum. This could be compensated for by hand-tuning, but not easily by a pedal drum. Mechanisms continued to improve in the early 20th century.\n\nDespite these problems, composers eagerly exploited the opportunities the new mechanism had to offer. By 1915, [[Carl Nielsen]] was demanding [[glissando]]s on timpani in his Fourth Symphony\u2014impossible on the old hand-tuned drums. However, it took [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] to more fully realize the flexibility the new mechanism had to offer. Many of his timpani parts require such a range of notes that it would be unthinkable to attempt them without pedal drums.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, timpani were almost always tuned with the [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] note of the piece on the low drum and the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] on the high drum\u2014a [[perfect fourth]] apart. Until the early 19th century the dominant (the note of the large drum) was written as G and the tonic (the note of the small drum) was written as C no matter what the actual key of the work was, and whether it was major or minor, with the actual pitches indicated at the top of the score (for example, ''Timpani in D\u2013A'' for a work in D major or D minor).<ref name = bridge/> This notation style however was not universal: Bach, Mozart, and Schubert (in his early works) used it, but their respective contemporaries Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven wrote for the timpani at concert pitch.<ref>{{cite book |first=Norman |last=Del Mar |title=The Anatomy of the Orchestra |publisher=University of California Press|year=1981}}{{Page needed|date=June 2012}}</ref> \n\nIn the 2010s, even though they are written at concert pitch, timpani parts continue to be most often<ref>See, as an early 20th-century example, the orchestral score of Debussy's [[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]: through no. 6 non-transposing parts have a key signature of one flat but the timpani part has no key signature, in bar 7 of no. 1 the timpani B{{music|flat}} is written in the staff; nos. 29 to 30 non-transposing parts have a key signature of four sharps but, again, the timpani part has no key signature, and so on.</ref> but not always<ref>For an example where this is not done, i.e. where the timpani part carries the same signature as all the other parts, see the orchestral score of Prokofiev's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Prokofiev)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] in D{{music|flat}} major, where, incidentally, transposing instrument parts are also written at concert pitch with the same key signature as all the other parts.</ref> written with no key signature, no matter what key the work is in: accidentals are written in the staff, both in the timpanist's part and the conductor's score.\n\n=== Outside the orchestra ===\n[[File:ML 1976 detail-timpani.jpg|thumb|This 1976 photograph shows marching timpani ''grounded'' with legs extended.]]\n[[File:John Bonham 1975.jpg|thumb|[[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]] with a timpano.]]\n\nLater, timpani were adopted into other classical music ensembles such as [[concert band]]s. In the 1970s, [[marching band]]s and [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|drum and bugle corps]], which evolved both from traditional marching bands and concert bands, began to include marching timpani. Unlike concert timpani, marching versions had fiberglass shells to make them light enough to carry. Each player carried a single drum, which was tuned by a hand crank. Often, during intricate passages, the timpani players would put their drums on the ground by means of extendable legs, and perform more like conventional timpani, yet with a single player per drum. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, marching arts-based organizations' allowance for timpani and other percussion instruments to be permanently grounded became mainstream. This was the beginning of the end for marching timpani: Eventually, standard concert timpani found their way onto the football field as part of the [[front ensemble]], and marching timpani fell out of common usage. Timpani are still used by the Mounted Bands of the [[Household Division]] of the [[British Army]]<ref>[[Beating Retreat]] page, showing image of mounted bands with timpani in 2008.</ref> and of the [[French_Republican_Guard_Band|Mounted Band]] of the [[Republican_Guard_(France)|''Garde R\u00e9publicaine'']] in the [[French Army]].\n\n<!-- need information about timpani in vaudeville and early jazz drum kits and such -->\nAs [[rock and roll]] bands started seeking to diversify their sound, timpani found their way into the studio. In 1959 Leiber and Stoller made the innovative use of timpani in their production of the Drifters' recording, \"There Goes My Baby.\" Starting in the 1960s, drummers for high-profile rock acts like [[The Beatles]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[The Beach Boys]], and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] incorporated timpani into their music.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McNamee |first1=David |title=Hey, what's that sound: Timpani |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/27/whats-that-sound-timpani |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=September 23, 2018|date=2009-04-27 }}</ref> This led to the use of timpani in [[progressive rock]]. [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]] recorded a number of rock covers of classical pieces that utilize timpani. [[Rush (band)|Rush]] drummer [[Neil Peart]] added a tympani to his expanding arsenal of percussion for the ''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]'' (1978) and ''[[Permanent Waves]]'' (1980) albums and tours, and would later sample tympani in his drum solo, \"The Rhythm Method\" in 1988. More recently, the rock band [[Muse (band)|Muse]] has incorporated timpani into some of their classically based songs, most notably in Exogenesis: Symphony, Part I (Overture). [[Jazz]] musicians also experimented with timpani. [[Sun Ra]] used it occasionally in his Arkestra (played, for example, by percussionist Jim Herndon on the songs \"Reflection in Blue\" and \"El Viktor,\" both recorded in 1957). In 1964, [[Elvin Jones]] incorporated timpani into his drum kit on [[John Coltrane]]'s four-part composition ''[[A Love Supreme]]''. [[Butch Trucks]], drummer with the [[Allman Brothers Band]] made use of the timpani. \n\nIn his choral piece [[A Stopwatch and an Ordnance Map]], [[Samuel Barber]] employs three pedal timpani upon which are played glissandos.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CFaAB8Tyxk</ref> \n\n[[Jonathan Haas]] is one of the few timpanists who markets himself as a soloist. Haas, who began his career as a solo timpanist in 1980, is notable for performing music from many genres including jazz, rock, and classical. He released an album with a rather unconventional jazz band called ''Johnny H. and the Prisoners of Swing''. Glass's ''Concerto Fantasy'', commissioned by Haas, put two soloists in ''front'' of the orchestra, an atypical placement for the instruments.<ref name=\"philipglass.com\"/> Haas also commissioned [[William Susman|Susman's]] ''Floating Falling'' for timpani and cello.<ref>[http://www.steveweissmusic.com/product/1129115/timpani-accompaniment \"Susman-Floating Falling\"], ''Steve Weiss Music''</ref>\n\n== List of famous solo works ==\n\n*\"Sonatina for Timpani\" by [[Alexander Tcherepnin]]\n*\"[[Eight Pieces for Four Timpani]]\" by [[Elliott Carter]]\n*\"Sonatina for Timpani\" by [[Alexander Tcherepnin]]\n*\"Concerto for Six Timpani\" by [[Georg Druschetzky]]\n*[[\"Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra\"|Concerto Fantasy for two Timpanists and Orchestra]] by [[Philip Glass]]\n*\"Concerto for Timpani and Orchestra Op.34\" by Werner Th\u00e4richen\n*''\"Konzertst\u00fcck'' for timpani and orchestra\" by [[Mauricio Kagel]]\n*\"Concerto for Timpani and Orchestra\" by [[William Kraft]]\n*\"Concerto for Timpani Op. 37\" by Ney Rosauro\n*\"Concertante per i bambini del mondo\" (for Timpani and Piano) by [[Luigi Morleo]]\n*\"Floating Falling for Timpani and Cello\" by [[William Susman]]\n\n== List of famous orchestral works ==\n*[[Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta]] by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]]\n*[[The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra]] by [[Benjamin Britten]]\n*Symphony for 2 Horns, 2 Violins, Viola, and Timpani by [[Christoph Graupner]]\n*Concerto for Wind Band, Timpani, and Orchestra by [[Gordon Jacob]]\n*[[Symphony No. 99]] by [[Johann Melchior Molter]]\n*[[Con brio (Widmann)|Con brio]] for Orchestra (and Timpani Soloist) by [[J\u00f6rg Widmann]]\n*Kurenti for Double bass and Timpani (1994) by Marko Ru\u017edjak\n*Planet Damnation (2012) by [[John Psathas]]\n*Animism (1995) by Steve Ridley\n*Suite from [[Na\u00efs]], Overture by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Electronic tuner]]\n* [[List of timpani manufacturers]]\n* [[Missing fundamental]]\n* [[Vibrations of a drum head]]\n* [[Davul]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Adler, Samuel.

In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent [[cel|celluloid sheets]] to be photographed and exhibited on [[film]]. Today, most animations are made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Computer animation]] can be very detailed [[3D computer graphics|3D animation]], while [[2D computer graphics|2D computer animation]] can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Other common animation methods apply a [[stop motion]] technique to two and three-dimensional objects like [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppet]]s or [[Clay animation|clay figures]].\n\nCommonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion\u2014as in motion pictures in general\u2014is thought to rely on the [[phi phenomenon]] and [[beta movement]], but the exact causes are still uncertain.\n[[Analog device|Analog]] mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]], [[zoetrope]], [[flip book]], [[praxinoscope]] and film. [[Television]] and [[video]] are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate [[digital media|digitally]]. For display on the computer, techniques like [[animated GIF]] and [[Flash animation]] were developed.\n\nAnimation is more pervasive than many people realize. Apart from [[short films]], [[feature films]], animated GIF's and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in [[video game]]s, [[motion graphics]], [[user interface]]s and [[visual effects]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZeiAAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=pervasive+animation&pg=PT19#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Pervasive Animation|first=Suzanne|last=Buchan|date=22 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136519550}}</ref>\n\nThe physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics \u2013 in for instance moving images in [[magic lantern]] shows \u2013 can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in [[automaton|automata]]. Electronic automata were popularized by [[Disney]] as [[animatronics]].\n\n[[Animator]]s are artists who specialize in creating animation.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"animation\" stems from the Latin \"anim\u0101ti\u014dn\", stem of \"anim\u0101ti\u014d\", meaning \"a bestowing of life\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation | title=The definition of animation on dictionary.com}}</ref> The primary meaning of the English word is \"liveliness\" and has been in use much longer than the meaning of \"moving image medium\".\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of animation}}\n\n===Before cinematography===\nAlthough examples of sequential images can be found occasionally throughout the history of art, there is no evidence of any related technology that enabled the artists to view such series in motion before 1832. Other ways to create moving images, by manipulating figures by hand or with mechanics, can be recognized in [[puppetry]], [[automaton|automata]], [[shadow play]] and (since around 1659) the [[magic lantern]].\n\n[[File:Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X.gif|thumb|Nr. 10 in the reworked second series of Stampfer's stroboscopic discs published by Trentsensky & Vieweg in 1833.]]\nIn 1833, the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] introduced the [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] principle of modern animation, which would also provide the basis for the [[zoetrope]] (1866), the [[flip book]] (1868), the [[praxinoscope]] (1877), Muybridge's [[zoopraxiscope]] (1879) and [[cinematography]].\n\n[[File:Lanature1882 praxinoscope projection reynaud.png|thumb|A projecting [[praxinoscope]], 1882, here shown superimposing an animated figure on a separately projected background scene]]\nA few years before the breakthrough of cinema in 1895, [[Charles-\u00c9mile Reynaud]] had much success with his ''[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique|Pantomimes Lumineuses]]''. These animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames that were manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film. Piano music, song, and some dialogue were performed live, while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900, Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the [[Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin]] in Paris\n\n===Silent era===\nA few years after film became a popular medium, some manufacturers of optical toys produced many [[chromolithography]] film loops for adapted toy magic lanterns. These lanterns usually depicted images traced from live-action film footage. At a time when hardly any animations could be seen in theaters, kids would project these animation loops at home.\n \nSome early filmmakers, including [[J. Stuart Blackton]], [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]], [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] and [[Edwin S. Porter]] experimented with [[stop-motion]] animation, possibly since around 1899, or, more likely, since 1906. Blackton's ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) was the first huge stop motion success, baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves. The short film inspired other filmmakers to try the technique.\n\nJ. Stuart Blackton's ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) is usually regarded as the first animated film on [[standard picture film]] shown in theatres. It was partly animated on a chalkboard and partly with cut-outs.\n\n[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) by [[\u00c9mile Cohl]]]]\n[[\u00c9mile Cohl]]'s ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) is the oldest known example of what became known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]].\n\nGreat artistic and very influential animations were made by [[Ladislas Starevich]] with his puppet animations since 1910 and by [[Winsor McCay]] with detailed drawn animation in films such as ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'' (1911) and ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914). Gertie was also an early example of character development in drawn animation{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=171}} and featured a scene with a live-action recording of McCay interacting with Gertie in a drawn landscape.\n\nDuring the 1910s, the production of animated \"[[cartoons]]\" became an industry.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=28}} The most successful producer at the time was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with animator [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=34}}\n\n[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character ''El Peludo'' (based on President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyen]]) patented in 1916 for the realization of his films, including the world's first animated feature film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]\nIn 1917, Argentine director [[Quirino Cristiani]] made the first feature-length film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'' (now lost), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani's ''[[Sin dejar rastros]]'' in 1918, but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government.\n\nIn 1919, the silent animated short ''[[Feline Follies]]'' marked the debut of [[Felix the Cat]], becoming the first animated character in the silent film era to gain significant popularity.\n\nAfter working on it for three years, [[Lotte Reiniger]] released the German feature-length silhouette animation ''[[Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed]]'' in 1926, the oldest extant animated feature.\n\n===1928-1960s: Golden age of American animation===\nIn 1928, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', featuring [[Mickey Mouse]], popularized film with synchronized sound and put [[Walt Disney]]'s studio at the forefront of the animation industry. In 1932, Disney also introduced the innovation of full colour (in ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'') as part of a three-year long exclusive deal with [[Technicolor]].\n\nThe enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the [[golden age of American animation]] that would last until 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts. Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long lasting careers, including [[Walt Disney Productions]]' [[Goofy]] (1932) and [[Donald Duck]] (1934), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]' [[Looney Tunes]] characters like [[Daffy Duck]] (1937), [[Bugs Bunny]] (1938/1940), [[Tweety]] (1941/1942), [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] (1949), [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Paramount Cartoon Studios]]' [[Betty Boop]] (1930), [[Popeye#Theatrical animated cartoons|Popeye]] (licensed by King Feature Syndicate) (1933), [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]] (licensed by DC Comics) (1941) and [[Casper the friendly ghost|Casper]] (1945), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]]: [[Tom and Jerry]] (1940) and [[Droopy]], [[Walter Lantz Productions]]/[[Universal Studio Cartoons]]'s [[Woody Woodpecker]] (1940), [[Terrytoons]]/[[20th Century Fox]]'s [[Mighty Mouse]] (1942) and [[United Artists]]' [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] (1963).\n\n===Animated features before CGI===\nAlthough at least eight animated feature films had been released in other countries and some had been quite successful, many Americans initially thought Disney's plans for an animated feature were foolish. In 1937, Disney proved them wrong with \"[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]\", a tremendous worldwide success. The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney's next features ''[[Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940) and Fleischer Studios' second animated feature ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'' (1941/1942) failed at the box office. For decades afterwards Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until [[Ralph Bakshi]] became the first to also release more than a handful features. He produced 8 theatrically released animated features aimed at adult audiences from 1972 to 1982. Sullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with ''[[An American Tail]]'' in 1986.\n\nAlthough relatively few titles became as successful as Disney's features, other countries (further) developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature animations in a wide variety of styles, relatively often including [[stop motion]] and [[cutout animation]] techniques. Russia's [[Soyuzmultfilm]] animation studio, founded in 1936, produced 20 films (including shorts) per year on average and, despite a decline afterwards, reached 1,582 titles in 2018. Also China, Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic, Italy, France and Belgium have animation industries that more than occasionally released feature films, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production, with its own recognizable [[anime]] style of effective [[limited animation]].\n\n===Animation on television===\nAnimation became very popular on television since the 1950s, when television sets started to become common in most wealthy countries. Cartoons were mainly programmed for children, on convenient time slots, and especially US youth spent many hours watching [[Saturday-morning cartoon]]s. Many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s, production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] was especially prolific and had huge hit series, such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960-1966) (the first [[prime time]] animated series),''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' (since 1969) and Belgian co-production ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' (1981-1989). The constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker [[limited animation]] methods and much more formulaic scripts. Quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (since 1989) as part of a \"renaissance\" of American animation.\n\nWhile American animation also experienced international successes, many other countries produced their own child-oriented programming, often preferring [[stop-motion]] and [[puppetry]] over cel animation. Japanese [[anime]] became very successful internationally since the 1960s, and European producers looking for affordable traditional animation relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios, with hit series such as ''[[Barbapapa]]'' (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973-1977), ''[[Vicky the Viking|Wickie und die starken M\u00e4nner/\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d0\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 \u30d3\u30c3\u30b1 (Vicky the Viking)]]'' (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974) and  ''[[Once Upon a Time...|Il \u00e9tait une fois\u2026 (Once Upon a Time...)]]'' (France/Japan 1978).\n\n===Switch from cel animation to computer animation===\n{{main|History of computer animation}}\n\n[[Computer animation]] was gradually developed since the 1940s. 3D wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s, with an early (short) appearance in the sci-fi thriller ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976).\n\n''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera.<ref name=\"first digital guinness\">{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-fully-digital-feature-film/ |title=First fully digital feature film |work=Guinness World Records |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |accessdate=2018-12-27 }}</ref> It was created with the [[Computer Animation Production System]] (CAPS) developed by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in collaboration with [[Pixar]] in the late 1980s, in a style that's very similar to traditional cel animation.\n\nThe 3D style, more often associated with computer animation, has become extremely popular since Pixar's ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first computer animated feature in this style. \n\nMost of the traditional animation film studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable. Not only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers, but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted appearance. Most of the characteristics of traditional handmade animation that were deemed charming could be emulated with software, while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/sergio-pablos-talks-about-his-stunning-hand-drawn-project-klaus-exclusive-113621.html |title=Sergio Pablos Talks About His Stunning Hand-Drawn Project 'Klaus' |last=Amidi |first=Amid |date=1 June 2015 |website=[[Cartoon Brew]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHxhr6KAaUw |title=The Origins of Klaus |date=10 October 2019 |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Abbie|title=Assignment X|url=http://www.assignmentx.com/2013/exclusive-interview-john-kahrs-kristina-reed-on-paperman/|work=Exclusive Interview: John Kahrs & Kristina Reed on PAPERMAN|publisher=Midnight Productions, Inc|accessdate=6 October 2013|date=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/06/28/first-look-paperman/2/#id=I2_1340992465384&parent=http%3A%2F%2Finsidemovies.ew.com&rpctoken=342270562&_methods=onPlusOne%2Constartinteraction%2C_ready%2C_close%2C_open%2C_resizeMe%2C_renderstart|title=FIRST LOOK: Disney's 'Paperman' fuses hand-drawn charm with digital depth|work=EW.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sarto|first=Dan|title=Inside Disney's New Animated Short Paperman|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/short-films/inside-disney-s-new-animated-short-paperman|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/06/29/disneys-paperman-animated-short-fuses-cg-and-hand-drawn-techniques/|title=Disney's Paperman animated short fuses CG and hand-drawn techniques|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.{{sfn|Board of Investments|2009}} Animated feature-length films returned the highest [[gross margin]]s (around 52%) of all [[film genre]]s between 2004 and2013.{{sfn|McDuling|2014}} Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early-2020s.\n\n==Education, propaganda and animated commercials==\nThe clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction, while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality. \n\nIn [[information technology]], there is an extremely thin line between a [[user interface]], [[motion graphics]] and narrative animation. The combined techniques can simultaneously function to provide tools, to instruct and to appeal.\n\nDuring World War II, animation was widely exploited for propaganda. [[World War II and American animation|Many American studios]], including Warner Bros. and Disney, lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey the public of certain war values. Some countries, including China, Japan and the United Kingdom, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts. \n\nAnimation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The legendary animation director [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] \"[[Kills Bugs Dead]]\" commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Spin-off enterprises: other media, merchandise and theme parks==\nApart from their success in movie theaters and television series, many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media.   \n\nAnimation has traditionally been very closely related to [[comic book]]s. While many comic book characters found their way to the screen, original animated characters also commonly appear in  comic books and magazines. Somewhat similarly, characters and plots for [[video game]]s (an interactive animation medium) have been derived from movies and vice versa.\n\nSome of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media. Stories and images can easily be adapted into children's books and other printed media. Songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media.\n\nWhile very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, [[The Walt Disney Company]] is the best known and most extreme example. Since first being licensed for a children's writing tablet in 1929, their [[Mickey Mouse]] mascot has been [[Mickey_Mouse#Merchandising|depicted on an enormous amount of products]], as have many other Disney characters. This may have influenced some [[Mickey_Mouse#pejorative use of Mickey's name|pejorative use of Mickey's name]], but [[Disney Consumer Products|licensed Disney products]] sell well, and the so-called [[Disneyana]] has many avid collectors, and even a dedicated Disneyana fanclub (since 1984).\n\n[[Disneyland]] opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on Disney's cartoon characters. Its enormous success spawned several other [[Disney_Parks,_Experiences_and_Products#Disney_resorts|Disney theme parks and resorts]]. [[The_Walt_Disney_Company#Financial_data|Disney's earnings]] from the theme parks has relatively often been higher than those from their movies.\n\n==Criticism==\nCriticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception. With its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films.{{sfn|Amidi|2011}} Many concerns of cultural representation, psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry, which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.{{sfn|Nagel|2008}}\n\n==Awards==\n{{Main|Animation studio#American studios}}\nAs with any other form of media, animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field. The original awards for animation were presented by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th [[Academy Awards]] function. The first winner of the [[5th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] was the short ''Flowers and Trees'',{{sfn|Walt Disney Family Museum|2013}} a production by [[Walt Disney Productions]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=37}}{{sfn|Shaffer|2010|page=211}} The Academy Award for a feature-length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. It was won by the film ''[[Shrek]]'', produced by [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] and [[Pacific Data Images]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=84\u201385}} [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award. ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was the first animated film nominated for Best Picture. ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' also received Best Picture nominations after the Academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten.\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]\n\nSeveral other countries have instituted an award for best-animated feature film as part of their national film awards: [[Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation]] (since 2008), [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006), [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2011), [[Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation]] (since 1981), [[Goya Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 1989), [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]] (since 2007), [[National Film Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006). Also since 2007, the [[Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] has been awarded at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]]. Since 2009, the [[European Film Awards]] have awarded the [[European Film Award for Best Animated Film]].\n\nThe [[Annie Award]] is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor. They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated Feature. The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney, however, newer studios, led by Pixar & DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award. The list of awardees is as follows:\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production]]\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Joy &amp; Heron - Animated CGI Spot by Passion Pictures.webm|thumb|Joy &amp; Heron - A featured video]]\nThe creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of [[filmmaking]], with certain unique aspects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=117}} Traits common to both live-action and animated [[Feature film|feature-length films]] are labor-intensity and high production costs.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=274}}\n\nThe most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the [[marginal cost]] of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films.{{sfn|White|2006|p=151}} It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more [[take]] during [[principal photography]] of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=339}} It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=55}} Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where [[storyboard artist]]s develop every single scene through [[storyboard]]s, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole. {{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=120}} While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=100\u201301}}\n\nAnother problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film's consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger. Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=94}} Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films. It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=37}}\n\nThis problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw [[model sheet]]s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=146}} On traditionally animated projects, [[maquette]]s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}}{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}\n\nUnlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=99\u2013100}} In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.\n\n=== Animator ===\n{{Main|Animator}}\nAn animator is an artist who creates a visual sequence (or audio-visual if added sound) of multiple sequential images that generate the illusion of movement, that is, an animation. Animations are currently in many areas of technology and video, such as [[Film|cinema]], [[television]], [[video game]]s or the [[internet]]. Generally, these works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods to create these images depend on the animator and style that one wants to achieve (with images generated by a computer, manually ...).\n\nAnimators can be divided into animators of '''characters''' (artists who are specialized in the movements, dialogue and acting of the characters) and animators of '''special effects''' (for example vehicles, machinery or natural phenomena such as water, snow, rain).\n\n== Techniques ==\n\n=== Traditional animation ===\n\n{{Main|Traditional animation}}\n\n[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos]]\n\n'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.{{sfn|White|2006|p=31}} The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=153}} To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|pp=277\u201379}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=203}} The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.{{sfn|White|2006|pp=195\u2013201}}\n\nThe traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35\u201336, 52\u201353}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The \"look\" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}} Some animation producers have used the term \"tradigital\" (a play on the words \"traditional\" and \"digital\") to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.\n\nExamples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63\u201365}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (US, 1998), ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988),{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=80}} ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).\n\n==== Full animation ====\n'''Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement,{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=71}} having a smooth animation.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=194\u201395}} Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''The Lion King'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. animation studio]]. Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n==== Limited animation ====\n\n{{Main|Limited animation}}\n\n'''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or \"skippy\" movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54\u201355}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera,{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later [[the Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).\n\n==== Rotoscoping ====\n\n{{Main|Rotoscoping}}\n\n'''Rotoscoping''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163\u201364}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|Aku no Hana]]'' (2013).\n\n==== Live-action/animation ====\n\n{{Main|Films with live action and animation}}\n\n'''[[Films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=162\u201363}} One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live action footage.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=18\u201319}}. Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of ''[[Alice comedies]]'' (1923-1927), in which a live-action girl enters an animated world. Other examples include ''[[Allegro Non Troppo]]'' (Italy, 1976), ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (US, 1988), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (US, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (US, 2001).\n\n=== Stop motion animation ===\n{{Main|Stop motion}}\n\n'''Stop-motion animation''' is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}} There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}} Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}}\n* '''[[Puppet animation]]''' typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=171}} The puppets generally have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=155\u201356}} Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka]] and the adult animated sketch-comedy television series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005\u2013present).\n** '''[[Puppetoon]]''', created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]],{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=70}} are puppet-animated films that typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=92\u201393}}\n[[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|A clay animation scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] television commercial]]\n* '''[[Clay animation]]''', or [[Plasticine]] animation (often called ''claymation'', which, however, is a [[Laika (company)|trademarked]] name), uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}}{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=150\u2013151}} The figures may have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=151\u201354}} Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include ''[[Gumby|The Gumby Show]]'' (US, 1957\u20131967), ''[[Mio Mao]]'' (Italy, 1974\u20132005), ''[[Morph (animation)|Morph]]'' shorts (UK, 1977\u20132000), ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' shorts (UK, as of 1989), [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]]'s ''[[Dimensions of Dialogue]]'' ([[Czechoslovakia]], 1982), ''[[The Trap Door]]'' (UK, 1984).

O'Brien]] on films, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933).\n** '''[[Go motion]]''' is a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create [[motion blur]] between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop-motion.{{sfn|Smith|1986|p=90}} The technique was invented by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] and [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[special effect]] scenes for the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980).{{sfn|Watercutter|2012}} Another example is the dragon named \"Vermithrax\" from ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]'' (1981 film).{{sfn|Smith|1986|pages=91\u201395}}\n* '''[[Object animation]]''' refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=51\u201357}}\n** '''[[Graphic animation]]''' uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.), which are sometimes manipulated frame-by-frame to create movement.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=128}} At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.\n** '''[[Brickfilm]]''' are a subgenre of object animation involving using [[Lego]] or other similar brick toys to make an animation.{{sfn|Paul|2005|pages=357\u201363}}{{sfn|Herman|2014}} These have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites, [[YouTube]] and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software.{{sfn|Haglund|2014}}\n* '''[[Pixilation]]''' involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75\u201379}} This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other effects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75\u201379}} Examples of pixilation include ''[[The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb]]'' and ''[[Angry Kid]]'' shorts, and the [[academy award]]-winning ''[[Neighbours (1952 film)|Neighbours]]'' by [[Norman McLaren]].\n\n=== Computer animation ===\n{{Main|Computer animation}}\n'''Computer animation''' encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}}{{sfn|Serenko|2007}} 2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=405}} 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.{{sfn|Serenko|2007|p=482}}\n\n==== 2D animation ====\n{{main|2D computer graphics}}\n[[File:Catenary animation.gif|thumb|A 2D animation of two circles joined by a chain]]\n\n[[2D computer graphics|2D animation]] figures are created or edited on the computer using 2D [[Raster graphics|bitmap graphics]] and 2D [[vector graphics]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=165}} This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques, [[Interpolation|interpolated]] [[morphing]],{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=32, 70, 132}} [[onion skinning]]{{sfn|Priebe|2006|pp=71\u201372}} and interpolated rotoscoping.\n\n2D animation has many applications, including [[Scanimate|analog computer animation]], [[Flash animation]], and [[PowerPoint animation]]. [[Cinemagraph]]s are [[Still life photography|still photographs]] in the form of an [[animated GIF]] file of which part is animated.{{sfn|White|2006|p=392}}\n\nFinal line [[advection]] animation is a technique used in 2D animation,{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|pp=246\u201347}} to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department.{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=127\u201328}} Speaking about using this approach in ''[[Paperman]]'', John Kahrs said that \"Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm.\"{{sfn|Beck|2012}}\n\n==== 3D animation ====\n{{Main|Computer animation|3D computer graphics}}\n3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. The animator usually starts by creating a 3D [[polygon mesh]] to manipulate.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} A mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces, which give the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} Sometimes, the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an [[Armature (computer animation)|armature]] that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=208}}{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=78\u201380}} This process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with keyframes to create movement.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=285}}\n\nOther techniques can be applied, mathematical functions (e.g., gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, and effects, fire and [[fluid animation|water simulations]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=96}} These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|p=92}}\n\n===== 3D terms =====\n* '''[[Cel-shaded animation]]''' is used to mimic traditional animation using computer software.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cel Shading: the Unsung Hero of Animation?|url=http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|publisher=Animator Mag|accessdate=20 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305090445/http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|archivedate=5 March 2016|date=17 December 2011}}</ref> Shading looks stark, with less blending of colors.

An Audio-Animatron is different from an [[android (robot)|android]]-type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds, rather than responding to external stimuli. In 2009, Disney created an interactive version of the technology called Autonomatronics.{{sfn|O'Keefe|2014}}\n** '''Linear Animation Generator''' is a form of animation by using static picture frames installed in a tunnel or a shaft. The animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in a linear motion, parallel to the installed picture frames.{{sfn|Parent|2007|pages=22\u201323}} The concept and the technical solution were invented in 2007 by Mihai Girlovan in Romania.\n* '''[[Chuckimation]]''' is a type of animation created by the makers of the television series ''[[Action League Now!]]'' in which characters/props are thrown, or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands.{{sfn|Kenyon|1998}}\n* The '''[[Magic lantern#Moving images|magic lantern]]''' used mechanical slides to project moving images, probably since Christiaan Huygens invented this early image projector in 1659.\n\n=== Other animation styles, techniques, and approaches ===\n[[File:World of Color overview.jpg|thumb|''[[World of Color]]'' hydrotechnics at [[Disney California Adventure]] creates illusion of motion using 1200 fountains with high-definition projections on mist screens.]]\n* '''Hydrotechnics''': a technique that includes lights, water, fire, fog, and lasers, with high-definition projections on mist screens.\n* '''[[Drawn on film animation]]''': a technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on [[film stock]], for example by [[Norman McLaren]],{{sfn|Faber|Walters|2004|p=1979}} [[Len Lye]] and [[Stan Brakhage]].\n* '''[[Paint-on-glass animation]]''': a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying [[oil paint]]s on sheets of glass,{{sfn|Pilling|1997|p=222}} for example by [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]].\n* '''Erasure animation''': a technique using traditional 2D media, photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image.

In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent [[cel|celluloid sheets]] to be photographed and exhibited on [[film]]. Today, most animations are made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Computer animation]] can be very detailed [[3D computer graphics|3D animation]], while [[2D computer graphics|2D computer animation]] can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Other common animation methods apply a [[stop motion]] technique to two and three-dimensional objects like [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppet]]s or [[Clay animation|clay figures]].\n\nCommonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion\u2014as in motion pictures in general\u2014is thought to rely on the [[phi phenomenon]] and [[beta movement]], but the exact causes are still uncertain.\n[[Analog device|Analog]] mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]], [[zoetrope]], [[flip book]], [[praxinoscope]] and film. [[Television]] and [[video]] are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate [[digital media|digitally]]. For display on the computer, techniques like [[animated GIF]] and [[Flash animation]] were developed.\n\nAnimation is more pervasive than many people realize. Apart from [[short films]], [[feature films]], animated GIF's and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in [[video game]]s, [[motion graphics]], [[user interface]]s and [[visual effects]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZeiAAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=pervasive+animation&pg=PT19#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Pervasive Animation|first=Suzanne|last=Buchan|date=22 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136519550}}</ref>\n\nThe physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics \u2013 in for instance moving images in [[magic lantern]] shows \u2013 can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in [[automaton|automata]]. Electronic automata were popularized by [[Disney]] as [[animatronics]].\n\n[[Animator]]s are artists who specialize in creating animation.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"animation\" stems from the Latin \"anim\u0101ti\u014dn\", stem of \"anim\u0101ti\u014d\", meaning \"a bestowing of life\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation | title=The definition of animation on dictionary.com}}</ref> The primary meaning of the English word is \"liveliness\" and has been in use much longer than the meaning of \"moving image medium\".\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of animation}}\n\n===Before cinematography===\nAlthough examples of sequential images can be found occasionally throughout the history of art, there is no evidence of any related technology that enabled the artists to view such series in motion before 1832. Other ways to create moving images, by manipulating figures by hand or with mechanics, can be recognized in [[puppetry]], [[automaton|automata]], [[shadow play]] and (since around 1659) the [[magic lantern]].\n\n[[File:Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X.gif|thumb|Nr. 10 in the reworked second series of Stampfer's stroboscopic discs published by Trentsensky & Vieweg in 1833.]]\nIn 1833, the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] introduced the [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] principle of modern animation, which would also provide the basis for the [[zoetrope]] (1866), the [[flip book]] (1868), the [[praxinoscope]] (1877), Muybridge's [[zoopraxiscope]] (1879) and [[cinematography]].\n\n[[File:Lanature1882 praxinoscope projection reynaud.png|thumb|A projecting [[praxinoscope]], 1882, here shown superimposing an animated figure on a separately projected background scene]]\nA few years before the breakthrough of cinema in 1895, [[Charles-\u00c9mile Reynaud]] had much success with his ''[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique|Pantomimes Lumineuses]]''. These animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames that were manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film. Piano music, song, and some dialogue were performed live, while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900, Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the [[Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin]] in Paris\n\n===Silent era===\nA few years after film became a popular medium, some manufacturers of optical toys produced many [[chromolithography]] film loops for adapted toy magic lanterns. These lanterns usually depicted images traced from live-action film footage. At a time when hardly any animations could be seen in theaters, kids would project these animation loops at home.\n \nSome early filmmakers, including [[J. Stuart Blackton]], [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]], [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] and [[Edwin S. Porter]] experimented with [[stop-motion]] animation, possibly since around 1899, or, more likely, since 1906. Blackton's ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) was the first huge stop motion success, baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves. The short film inspired other filmmakers to try the technique.\n\nJ. Stuart Blackton's ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) is usually regarded as the first animated film on [[standard picture film]] shown in theatres. It was partly animated on a chalkboard and partly with cut-outs.\n\n[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) by [[\u00c9mile Cohl]]]]\n[[\u00c9mile Cohl]]'s ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) is the oldest known example of what became known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]].\n\nGreat artistic and very influential animations were made by [[Ladislas Starevich]] with his puppet animations since 1910 and by [[Winsor McCay]] with detailed drawn animation in films such as ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'' (1911) and ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914). Gertie was also an early example of character development in drawn animation{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=171}} and featured a scene with a live-action recording of McCay interacting with Gertie in a drawn landscape.\n\nDuring the 1910s, the production of animated \"[[cartoons]]\" became an industry.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=28}} The most successful producer at the time was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with animator [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=34}}\n\n[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character ''El Peludo'' (based on President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyen]]) patented in 1916 for the realization of his films, including the world's first animated feature film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]\nIn 1917, Argentine director [[Quirino Cristiani]] made the first feature-length film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'' (now lost), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani's ''[[Sin dejar rastros]]'' in 1918, but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government.\n\nIn 1919, the silent animated short ''[[Feline Follies]]'' marked the debut of [[Felix the Cat]], becoming the first animated character in the silent film era to gain significant popularity.\n\nAfter working on it for three years, [[Lotte Reiniger]] released the German feature-length silhouette animation ''[[Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed]]'' in 1926, the oldest extant animated feature.\n\n===1928-1960s: Golden age of American animation===\nIn 1928, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', featuring [[Mickey Mouse]], popularized film with synchronized sound and put [[Walt Disney]]'s studio at the forefront of the animation industry. In 1932, Disney also introduced the innovation of full colour (in ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'') as part of a three-year long exclusive deal with [[Technicolor]].\n\nThe enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the [[golden age of American animation]] that would last until 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts. Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long lasting careers, including [[Walt Disney Productions]]' [[Goofy]] (1932) and [[Donald Duck]] (1934), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]' [[Looney Tunes]] characters like [[Daffy Duck]] (1937), [[Bugs Bunny]] (1938/1940), [[Tweety]] (1941/1942), [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] (1949), [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Paramount Cartoon Studios]]' [[Betty Boop]] (1930), [[Popeye#Theatrical animated cartoons|Popeye]] (licensed by King Feature Syndicate) (1933), [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]] (licensed by DC Comics) (1941) and [[Casper the friendly ghost|Casper]] (1945), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]]: [[Tom and Jerry]] (1940) and [[Droopy]], [[Walter Lantz Productions]]/[[Universal Studio Cartoons]]'s [[Woody Woodpecker]] (1940), [[Terrytoons]]/[[20th Century Fox]]'s [[Mighty Mouse]] (1942) and [[United Artists]]' [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] (1963).\n\n===Animated features before CGI===\nAlthough at least eight animated feature films had been released in other countries and some had been quite successful, many Americans initially thought Disney's plans for an animated feature were foolish. In 1937, Disney proved them wrong with \"[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]\", a tremendous worldwide success. The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney's next features ''[[Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940) and Fleischer Studios' second animated feature ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'' (1941/1942) failed at the box office. For decades afterwards Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until [[Ralph Bakshi]] became the first to also release more than a handful features. He produced 8 theatrically released animated features aimed at adult audiences from 1972 to 1982. Sullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with ''[[An American Tail]]'' in 1986.\n\nAlthough relatively few titles became as successful as Disney's features, other countries (further) developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature animations in a wide variety of styles, relatively often including [[stop motion]] and [[cutout animation]] techniques. Russia's [[Soyuzmultfilm]] animation studio, founded in 1936, produced 20 films (including shorts) per year on average and, despite a decline afterwards, reached 1,582 titles in 2018. Also China, Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic, Italy, France and Belgium have animation industries that more than occasionally released feature films, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production, with its own recognizable [[anime]] style of effective [[limited animation]].\n\n===Animation on television===\nAnimation became very popular on television since the 1950s, when television sets started to become common in most wealthy countries. Cartoons were mainly programmed for children, on convenient time slots, and especially US youth spent many hours watching [[Saturday-morning cartoon]]s. Many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s, production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] was especially prolific and had huge hit series, such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960-1966) (the first [[prime time]] animated series),''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' (since 1969) and Belgian co-production ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' (1981-1989). The constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker [[limited animation]] methods and much more formulaic scripts. Quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (since 1989) as part of a \"renaissance\" of American animation.\n\nWhile American animation also experienced international successes, many other countries produced their own child-oriented programming, often preferring [[stop-motion]] and [[puppetry]] over cel animation. Japanese [[anime]] became very successful internationally since the 1960s, and European producers looking for affordable traditional animation relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios, with hit series such as ''[[Barbapapa]]'' (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973-1977), ''[[Vicky the Viking|Wickie und die starken M\u00e4nner/\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d0\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 \u30d3\u30c3\u30b1 (Vicky the Viking)]]'' (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974) and  ''[[Once Upon a Time...|Il \u00e9tait une fois\u2026 (Once Upon a Time...)]]'' (France/Japan 1978).\n\n===Switch from cel animation to computer animation===\n{{main|History of computer animation}}\n\n[[Computer animation]] was gradually developed since the 1940s. 3D wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s, with an early (short) appearance in the sci-fi thriller''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976).\n\n[[The Rescuers Down Under]] was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera.<ref name=\"first digital guinness\">{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-fully-digital-feature-film/ |title=First fully digital feature film |work=Guinness World Records |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |accessdate=2018-12-27 }}</ref> It was created with the [[Computer Animation Production System]] (CAPS) developed by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in collaboration with [[Pixar]] in the late 1980s, in a style that's very similar to traditional cel animation.\n\nThe 3D style, more often associated with computer animation, has become extremely popular since Pixar's ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first computer animated feature in this style. \n\nMost of the traditional animation film studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable. Not only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers, but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted appearance. Most of the characteristics of traditional handmade animation that were deemed charming could be emulated with software, while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/sergio-pablos-talks-about-his-stunning-hand-drawn-project-klaus-exclusive-113621.html |title=Sergio Pablos Talks About His Stunning Hand-Drawn Project 'Klaus' |last=Amidi |first=Amid |date=1 June 2015 |website=[[Cartoon Brew]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHxhr6KAaUw |title=The Origins of Klaus |date=10 October 2019 |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Abbie|title=Assignment X|url=http://www.assignmentx.com/2013/exclusive-interview-john-kahrs-kristina-reed-on-paperman/|work=Exclusive Interview: John Kahrs & Kristina Reed on PAPERMAN|publisher=Midnight Productions, Inc|accessdate=6 October 2013|date=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/06/28/first-look-paperman/2/#id=I2_1340992465384&parent=http%3A%2F%2Finsidemovies.ew.com&rpctoken=342270562&_methods=onPlusOne%2Constartinteraction%2C_ready%2C_close%2C_open%2C_resizeMe%2C_renderstart|title=FIRST LOOK: Disney's 'Paperman' fuses hand-drawn charm with digital depth|work=EW.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sarto|first=Dan|title=Inside Disney's New Animated Short Paperman|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/short-films/inside-disney-s-new-animated-short-paperman|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/06/29/disneys-paperman-animated-short-fuses-cg-and-hand-drawn-techniques/|title=Disney's Paperman animated short fuses CG and hand-drawn techniques|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.{{sfn|Board of Investments|2009}} Animated feature-length films returned the highest [[gross margin]]s (around 52%) of all [[film genre]]s between 2004 and2013.{{sfn|McDuling|2014}} Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early-2020s.\n\n==Education, propaganda and animated commercials==\nThe clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction, while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality. \n\nIn [[information technology]], there is an extremely thin line between a [[user interface]], [[motion graphics]] and narrative animation. The combined techniques can simultaneously function to provide tools, to instruct and to appeal.\n\nDuring World War II, animation was widely exploited for propaganda. [[World War II and American animation|Many American studios]], including Warner Bros. and Disney, lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey the public of certain war values. Some countries, including China, Japan and the United Kingdom, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts. \n\nAnimation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The legendary animation director [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] \"[[Kills Bugs Dead]]\" commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Spin-off enterprises: other media, merchandise and theme parks==\nApart from their success in movie theaters and television series, many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media.   \n\nAnimation has traditionally been very closely related to [[comic book]]s. While many comic book characters found their way to the screen, original animated characters also commonly appear in  comic books and magazines. Somewhat similarly, characters and plots for [[video game]]s (an interactive animation medium) have been derived from movies and vice versa.\n\nSome of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media. Stories and images can easily be adapted into children's books and other printed media. Songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media.\n\nWhile very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, [[The Walt Disney Company]] is the best known and most extreme example. Since first being licensed for a children's writing tablet in 1929, their [[Mickey Mouse]] mascot has been [[Mickey_Mouse#Merchandising|depicted on an enormous amount of products]], as have many other Disney characters. This may have influenced some [[Mickey_Mouse#pejorative use of Mickey's name|pejorative use of Mickey's name]], but [[Disney Consumer Products|licensed Disney products]] sell well, and the so-called [[Disneyana]] has many avid collectors, and even a dedicated Disneyana fanclub (since 1984).\n\n[[Disneyland]] opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on Disney's cartoon characters. Its enormous success spawned several other [[Disney_Parks,_Experiences_and_Products#Disney_resorts|Disney theme parks and resorts]]. [[The_Walt_Disney_Company#Financial_data|Disney's earnings]] from the theme parks has relatively often been higher than those from their movies.\n\n==Criticism==\nCriticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception. With its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films.{{sfn|Amidi|2011}} Many concerns of cultural representation, psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry, which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.{{sfn|Nagel|2008}}\n\n==Awards==\n{{Main|Animation studio#American studios}}\nAs with any other form of media, animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field. The original awards for animation were presented by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th [[Academy Awards]] function. The first winner of the [[5th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] was the short ''Flowers and Trees'',{{sfn|Walt Disney Family Museum|2013}} a production by [[Walt Disney Productions]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=37}}{{sfn|Shaffer|2010|page=211}} The Academy Award for a feature-length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. It was won by the film ''[[Shrek]]'', produced by [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] and [[Pacific Data Images]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=84\u201385}} [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award. ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was the first animated film nominated for Best Picture. ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' also received Best Picture nominations after the Academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten.\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]\n\nSeveral other countries have instituted an award for best-animated feature film as part of their national film awards: [[Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation]] (since 2008), [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006), [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2011), [[Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation]] (since 1981), [[Goya Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 1989), [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]] (since 2007), [[National Film Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006). Also since 2007, the [[Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] has been awarded at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]]. Since 2009, the [[European Film Awards]] have awarded the [[European Film Award for Best Animated Film]].\n\nThe [[Annie Award]] is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor. They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated Feature. The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney, however, newer studios, led by Pixar & DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award. The list of awardees is as follows:\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production]]\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Joy &amp; Heron - Animated CGI Spot by Passion Pictures.webm|thumb|Joy &amp; Heron - A featured video]]\nThe creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of [[filmmaking]], with certain unique aspects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=117}} Traits common to both live-action and animated [[Feature film|feature-length films]] are labor-intensity and high production costs.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=274}}\n\nThe most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the [[marginal cost]] of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films.{{sfn|White|2006|p=151}} It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more [[take]] during [[principal photography]] of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=339}} It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=55}} Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where [[storyboard artist]]s develop every single scene through [[storyboard]]s, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole. {{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=120}} While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=100\u201301}}\n\nAnother problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film's consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger. Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=94}} Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films. It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=37}}\n\nThis problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw [[model sheet]]s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=146}} On traditionally animated projects, [[maquette]]s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}}{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}\n\nUnlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=99\u2013100}} In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.\n\n=== Animator ===\n{{Main|Animator}}\nAn animator is an artist who creates a visual sequence (or audio-visual if added sound) of multiple sequential images that generate the illusion of movement, that is, an animation. Animations are currently in many areas of technology and video, such as [[Film|cinema]], [[television]], [[video game]]s or the [[internet]]. Generally, these works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods to create these images depend on the animator and style that one wants to achieve (with images generated by a computer, manually ...).\n\nAnimators can be divided into animators of '''characters''' (artists who are specialized in the movements, dialogue and acting of the characters) and animators of '''special effects''' (for example vehicles, machinery or natural phenomena such as water, snow, rain).\n\n== Techniques ==\n\n=== Traditional animation ===\n\n{{Main|Traditional animation}}\n\n[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos]]\n\n'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.{{sfn|White|2006|p=31}} The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=153}} To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|pp=277\u201379}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=203}} The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.{{sfn|White|2006|pp=195\u2013201}}\n\nThe traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35\u201336, 52\u201353}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The \"look\" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}} Some animation producers have used the term \"tradigital\" (a play on the words \"traditional\" and \"digital\") to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.\n\nExamples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63\u201365}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (US, 1998), ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988),{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=80}} ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).\n\n==== Full animation ====\n'''Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement,{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=71}} having a smooth animation.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=194\u201395}} Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''The Lion King'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. animation studio]]. Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n==== Limited animation ====\n\n{{Main|Limited animation}}\n\n'''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or \"skippy\" movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54\u201355}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera,{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later [[the Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).\n\n==== Rotoscoping ====\n\n{{Main|Rotoscoping}}\n\n'''Rotoscoping''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163\u201364}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|Aku no Hana]]'' (2013).\n\n==== Live-action/animation ====\n\n{{Main|Films with live action and animation}}\n\n'''[[Films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=162\u201363}} One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live action footage.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=18\u201319}}. Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of ''[[Alice comedies]]'' (1923-1927), in which a live-action girl enters an animated world. Other examples include ''[[Allegro Non Troppo]]'' (Italy, 1976), ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (US, 1988), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (US, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (US, 2001).\n\n=== Stop motion animation ===\n{{Main|Stop motion}}\n\n'''Stop-motion animation''' is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}} There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}} Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}}\n* '''[[Puppet animation]]''' typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=171}} The puppets generally have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=155\u201356}} Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka]] and the adult animated sketch-comedy television series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005\u2013present).\n** '''[[Puppetoon]]''', created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]],{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=70}} are puppet-animated films that typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=92\u201393}}\n[[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|A clay animation scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] television commercial]]\n* '''[[Clay animation]]''', or [[Plasticine]] animation (often called ''claymation'', which, however, is a [[Laika (company)|trademarked]] name), uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}}{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=150\u2013151}} The figures may have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=151\u201354}} Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include ''[[Gumby|The Gumby Show]]'' (US, 1957\u20131967), ''[[Mio Mao]]'' (Italy, 1974\u20132005), ''[[Morph (animation)|Morph]]'' shorts (UK, 1977\u20132000), ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' shorts (UK, as of 1989), [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]]'s ''[[Dimensions of Dialogue]]'' ([[Czechoslovakia]], 1982), ''[[The Trap Door]]'' (UK, 1984).

O'Brien]] on films, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933).\n** '''[[Go motion]]''' is a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create [[motion blur]] between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop-motion.{{sfn|Smith|1986|p=90}} The technique was invented by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] and [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[special effect]] scenes for the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980).{{sfn|Watercutter|2012}} Another example is the dragon named \"Vermithrax\" from ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]'' (1981 film).{{sfn|Smith|1986|pages=91\u201395}}\n* '''[[Object animation]]''' refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=51\u201357}}\n** '''[[Graphic animation]]''' uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.), which are sometimes manipulated frame-by-frame to create movement.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=128}} At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.\n** '''[[Brickfilm]]''' are a subgenre of object animation involving using [[Lego]] or other similar brick toys to make an animation.{{sfn|Paul|2005|pages=357\u201363}}{{sfn|Herman|2014}} These have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites, [[YouTube]] and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software.{{sfn|Haglund|2014}}\n* '''[[Pixilation]]''' involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75\u201379}} This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other effects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75\u201379}} Examples of pixilation include ''[[The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb]]'' and ''[[Angry Kid]]'' shorts, and the [[academy award]]-winning ''[[Neighbours (1952 film)|Neighbours]]'' by [[Norman McLaren]].\n\n=== Computer animation ===\n{{Main|Computer animation}}\n'''Computer animation''' encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}}{{sfn|Serenko|2007}} 2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=405}} 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.{{sfn|Serenko|2007|p=482}}\n\n==== 2D animation ====\n{{main|2D computer graphics}}\n[[File:Catenary animation.gif|thumb|A 2D animation of two circles joined by a chain]]\n\n[[2D computer graphics|2D animation]] figures are created or edited on the computer using 2D [[Raster graphics|bitmap graphics]] and 2D [[vector graphics]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=165}} This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques, [[Interpolation|interpolated]] [[morphing]],{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=32, 70, 132}} [[onion skinning]]{{sfn|Priebe|2006|pp=71\u201372}} and interpolated rotoscoping.\n\n2D animation has many applications, including [[Scanimate|analog computer animation]], [[Flash animation]], and [[PowerPoint animation]]. [[Cinemagraph]]s are [[Still life photography|still photographs]] in the form of an [[animated GIF]] file of which part is animated.{{sfn|White|2006|p=392}}\n\nFinal line [[advection]] animation is a technique used in 2D animation,{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|pp=246\u201347}} to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department.{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=127\u201328}} Speaking about using this approach in ''[[Paperman]]'', John Kahrs said that \"Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm.\"{{sfn|Beck|2012}}\n\n==== 3D animation ====\n{{Main|Computer animation|3D computer graphics}}\n3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. The animator usually starts by creating a 3D [[polygon mesh]] to manipulate.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} A mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces, which give the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} Sometimes, the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an [[Armature (computer animation)|armature]] that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=208}}{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=78\u201380}} This process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with keyframes to create movement.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=285}}\n\nOther techniques can be applied, mathematical functions (e.g., gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, and effects, fire and [[fluid animation|water simulations]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=96}} These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|p=92}}\n\n===== 3D terms =====\n* '''[[Cel-shaded animation]]''' is used to mimic traditional animation using computer software.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cel Shading: the Unsung Hero of Animation?|url=http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|publisher=Animator Mag|accessdate=20 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305090445/http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|archivedate=5 March 2016|date=17 December 2011}}</ref> Shading looks stark, with less blending of colors.

They can sit and stand, and they cannot walk. An Audio-Animatron is different from an [[android (robot)|android]]-type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds, rather than responding to external stimuli. In 2009, Disney created an interactive version of the technology called Autonomatronics.{{sfn|O'Keefe|2014}}\n** '''Linear Animation Generator''' is a form of animation by using static picture frames installed in a tunnel or a shaft. The animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in a linear motion, parallel to the installed picture frames.{{sfn|Parent|2007|pages=22\u201323}} The concept and the technical solution were invented in 2007 by Mihai Girlovan in Romania.\n* '''[[Chuckimation]]''' is a type of animation created by the makers of the television series ''[[Action League Now!]]'' in which characters/props are thrown, or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands.{{sfn|Kenyon|1998}}\n* The '''[[Magic lantern#Moving images|magic lantern]]''' used mechanical slides to project moving images, probably since Christiaan Huygens invented this early image projector in 1659.\n\n=== Other animation styles, techniques, and approaches ===\n[[File:World of Color overview.jpg|thumb|''[[World of Color]]'' hydrotechnics at [[Disney California Adventure]] creates illusion of motion using 1200 fountains with high-definition projections on mist screens.]]\n* '''Hydrotechnics''': a technique that includes lights, water, fire, fog, and lasers, with high-definition projections on mist screens.\n* '''[[Drawn on film animation]]''': a technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on [[film stock]], for example by [[Norman McLaren]],{{sfn|Faber|Walters|2004|p=1979}} [[Len Lye]] and [[Stan Brakhage]].\n* '''[[Paint-on-glass animation]]''': a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying [[oil paint]]s on sheets of glass,{{sfn|Pilling|1997|p=222}} for example by [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]].\n* '''Erasure animation''': a technique using traditional 2D media, photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image.

It is located in the northern-central part of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, on the eastern side of the [[Andes]]. As of the {{census-ar|2010}}, Mendoza had a population of 115,041 with a metropolitan population of 1,055,679, making [[Greater Mendoza]] the fourth largest census metropolitan area in the country.\n\n[[National Route 7 (Argentina)|Ruta Nacional 7]], the major road running between [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], runs through Mendoza. The city is a frequent stopover for climbers on their way to [[Aconcagua]] (the highest mountain in the Western and Southern Hemispheres) and for [[adventure travel]]ers interested in [[mountaineering]], [[hiking]], [[horse riding]], [[rafting]], and other sports. In the winter, [[ski]]ers come to the city for easy access to the Andes.\n\nTwo of the main industries of the Mendoza area are [[olive oil]] production and [[Argentine wine]]. The region around Greater Mendoza is the largest wine-producing area in [[South America]]. As such, Mendoza is one of the nine Great Wine Capitals,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greatwinecapitals.com/ |title=The Great Wine Capitals |access-date=2019-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807002916/http://www.greatwinecapitals.com/ |archive-date=2019-08-07 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the city is an emerging [[enotourism]] destination and base for exploring the region's hundreds of wineries located along the [[Argentina Wine Route]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Traza de la segunda fundaci\u00f3n de Mendoza, 1562.jpg|left|thumb|Print of the second foundation of Mendoza, 1562]]\nOn March 2, 1561, [[Pedro del Castillo]] founded the city and named it ''Ciudad de Mendoza del Nuevo Valle de La Rioja'' after the governor of [[Chile]], Don [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.welcomeargentina.com/mendoza/history.html |title=welcomeargentina.com: Land of the good wine |access-date=2007-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018111852/http://welcomeargentina.com/mendoza/history.html |archive-date=2007-10-18 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Before the 1560s the area was populated by tribes known as the [[Huarpe]]s and [[Puelche]]s. The Huarpes devised a system of irrigation that was later developed by the Spanish. This allowed for an increase in population that might not have otherwise occurred. The system is still evident today in the wide trenches ([[acequia]]s), which run along all city streets, watering the approximately 100,000 trees that line every street in Mendoza.\n\nIt is estimated that fewer than 80 Spanish settlers lived in the area before 1600, but later prosperity increased due to the use of indigenous and slave labor, and the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] presence in the region. When nearby rivers were tapped as a source of irrigation in 1788 agricultural production increased. The extra revenues generated from this, and the ensuing additional trade with [[Buenos Aires]], no doubt led to the creation of the state of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] in 1813 with [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] as governor. It was from Mendoza that San Mart\u00edn and other Argentinian and Chilean patriots organized the army with which they won the independence of [[Chilean Independence|Chile]] and [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peru]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |title=Morris Charles \u2013 The Hannibal of the Andes and the Freedom of Chile |access-date=2007-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610043606/http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |archive-date=2011-06-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMendoza suffered [[1861 Mendoza earthquake|a severe earthquake]] in 1861 that killed at least 5,000 people.

It is located in the northern-central part of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, on the eastern side of the [[Andes]]. As of the {{census-ar|2010}}, Mendoza had a population of 115,041 with a metropolitan population of 1,055,679, making [[Greater Mendoza]] the fourth largest census metropolitan area in the country.\n\n[[National Route 7 (Argentina)|Ruta Nacional 7]], the major road running between [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], runs through Mendoza. The city is a frequent stopover for climbers on their way to [[Aconcagua]] (the highest mountain in the Western and Southern Hemispheres) and for [[adventure travel]]ers interested in [[mountaineering]], [[hiking]], [[horse riding]], [[rafting]], and other sports. In the winter, [[ski]]ers come to the city for easy access to the Andes.\n\nTwo of the main industries of the Mendoza area are [[olive oil]] production and [[Argentine wine]]. The region around Greater Mendoza is the largest wine-producing area in [[South America]].

The Huarpes devised a system of irrigation that was later developed by the Spanish. This allowed for an increase in population that might not have otherwise occurred. The system is still evident today in the wide trenches ([[acequia]]s), which run along all city streets, watering the approximately 100,000 trees that line every street in Mendoza.\n\nIt is estimated that fewer than 80 Spanish settlers lived in the area before 1600, but later prosperity increased due to the use of indigenous and slave labor, and the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] presence in the region. When nearby rivers were tapped as a source of irrigation in 1788 agricultural production increased. The extra revenues generated from this, and the ensuing additional trade with [[Buenos Aires]], no doubt led to the creation of the state of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] in 1813 with [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] as governor. It was from Mendoza that San Mart\u00edn and other Argentinian and Chilean patriots organized the army with which they won the independence of [[Chilean Independence|Chile]] and [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peru]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |title=Morris Charles \u2013 The Hannibal of the Andes and the Freedom of Chile |access-date=2007-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610043606/http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |archive-date=2011-06-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMendoza suffered [[1861 Mendoza earthquake|a severe earthquake]] in 1861 that killed at least 5,000 people.

He was known to be concerned with the needs of the common people as well as those of the military and bureaucratic classes.\n\n==Earlier years==\nAmcazade Huseyin was born in 1644 and was the son of [[Hasan A\u011fa Kypriljoti]], the brother of [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha]], and for this reason he has the cognonom of \"amcazade (nephew)\". We have little of his youth and education. His father had agricultural estates at the Turkish village of \"Kozluca\" in present-day [[Bulgaria]] and young Huseyin spent his youth there. He must have had a good Ottoman classical scribal or military education, since because when he is first mentioned he is a staff officer. He participated at the campaign for Siege of Vienna at 1683, as a high staff officer in the Ottoman army since Ottomans were commanded by the Grand Vizier [[Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa Pasha]], who was his close relative. After the defeat of Ottomans at the [[Battle of Vienna]] and retreat to [[Belgrade]], Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa was executed and Amcazade Huseyin was arrested because of his close relationship to the executed commander. \n\nIn 1684 he was released from prison, but was sent away from the seat of power as an administrator of provinces with a rank of ''[[beylerbey]]''. First he was appointed as guard-governor of Cardak near [[Gallipoli]] at the [[Dardanelles]] Straits; then he was given the rank of [[vizier]] and given a similar but more prestigious job at [[Seddulbahir]]. In 1691 for a time he was appointed as the temporary governor (''[[kaimakam]]'' of Istanbul and returned to his main job on Dardanelles. On 1694 he was appointed the [[Kapudan Pasha]] (Ottoman admiral-in-chief) and was instrumental with the help of [[Mezzo Morto Huseyin Pasha]] in retaking of [[Chios]] from the Venetians in 1695. For this success he was appointed the governor of Chios. In 1696 he was again appointed as the temporary governor of Istanbul but soon was sent to the post of governorship of Belgrade. In August 1697 the Ottoman army under the command of Sultan [[Mustafa II]] was on the campaign against the Austrians and came to Belgrade. In a War Council planning on what to do next, Amcazade Huseyin Pasha proposed that the Ottoman army should go and put under siege the fortress of [[Vara\u017edin]]. However, others argued that it should go towards [[Timi\u0219oara|Temesvar]]; their proposal was accepted and the Ottoman army was surprised and routed at the [[Battle of Zenta]].<ref name=\"aksit\">\"Amcazade H\u00fcseyin Pa\u015fa\" in Niyazi Aksit (1984)''A'dan Z'ye Tarih Ansiklopedisi (A to Z History Encyclopedia)'', Istanbul:Serhat Yayinlari p.55(Turkish)</ref>\n\nHis daughter married [[Kavanoz Ahmed Pasha]], who was grand vizier for a short time in 1703.<ref name=\"sicilli\">{{citation|author=Mehmet S\u00fcreyya|editor1=Nuri Akbayar|editor2=Seyit A.

He was given a promise by the Sultan that he would be free agent in his government of the Empire with no interference by the Sultan. It was hoped that during the negotiations for peace to take place at Karlowitz, he could use family ability to get best possible terms for the ending of the long war against the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League of 1684]], a coalition of European powers including the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the [[Republic of Venice]] and [[Peter I of Russia]]. After long months of negotiations the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] was signed on 26 January 1699. The Ottomans ceded to the Habsburg Monarchy, all of the Ottoman province of [[Hungary]] including [[Transylvania]] which was conquered after 1526; [[Podolia]] was returned to Poland and most of [[Dalmatia]] and [[Morea]] (the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula in southern Greece)  passed to Venice. With the heavy loss of professional soldiers at the Battle of Zenta and the large territories ceded away, it became obvious that Ottoman military system, the financial system and bureaucratic systems sustaining the military and the state had to be reformed. This task fell mainly on the shoulders of the Grand Vizier Amcazade K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc H\u00fcseyin Pasha.\n\nAmcazade Huseyin started with economic and financial reforms. The excise duties on tobacco and coffee, which had quadrupled during the war to provide finance for military effort, were substantially reduced and so too the duties on essential consumer goods, for example soap and cooking oil. During the war special imposition taxes were created and those who could not pay these extraordinary tax impositions were heavily fined. Amcazade Huseyin abolished these extraordinary tax impositions and issued a [[tax amnesty]] on those who were not able to pay and who were required to pay heavy fines. The rates of traditional taxes were adjusted down so that they matched the ability to pay. Debased coins struck during the war were replaced by coins of full value. New cultivators, from nomadic Turcomans, were induced to settle in places like Urfa, Malatya, Antalya and Cyprus where the numbers of agricultural peasants had decreased to very low levels. Efforts were made to develop a new manufacturing base, in place of devastated Ottoman craft industries and replacing imports from Europe.<ref name=\"shaw\"/>{{rp|225}}\n\nAmcazade Huseyin, then, had the salary rolls of the professional army (''[[kap\u0131kulu]]'' corps) reviewed. The [[Janissaries]], who had reached 70.000 men before Treaty of Karlowitz, of which only 10.000 were actually combatants, were reduced to 34,000 combatants; while the [[Humbarac\u0131|Artillery Corps]] was reduced from 6,000 to 1,250. There was new recruitment to the [[Six Divisions of Cavalry|Kap\u0131kulu Sipahi Corps]]. Similarly, the provincial [[timariot]] [[sipahis]] were reformed by eliminating bribery and making sure that they were properly maintained and trained.<ref name=\"shaw\"/>{{rp|225}}\n\nThe Navy was also reorganised under the command of [[Mezzo Morto H\u00fcseyin Pasha]], who was a close ally of Amcazade Huseyin. At last, a new fleet of wind-driven galleons replaced the oar-driven galleys. The naval officers and personnel were also fully reorganised creating a complete hierarchy of officers. The lower rank galleon men were properly and regularly housed in barracks; paid well and even their retirement was thought of for the first time in Ottoman navy. Finally, the bureaucracy of scribes of the central government and of the palace was reorganised, retiring old inefficient scribes and introducing new ones trained at new scribal schools.<ref name=\"shaw\"/>{{rp|226}}\n\nThe Sultan was very much affected by the defeat at Battle of Zenta, where he was personally present. Giving Amcazade Huseyin a free hand in governing his realm, he retreated to a court life, not in Istanbul but in the old palace in [[Edirne]]. His close advisor was his old teacher, a cleric called [[Feyzullah Efendi]], who he appointed as the [[Sheikh ul-Islam]]. Soon Feyzullah Efendi became the effective voice of the Sultan. As soon as the effects of Treaty of Karlowitz over, Feyzullah Efendi collected around him a clique of relatives and allies; started appointing them to key state posts and became the centre of intrigues against the Grand Vizier Amcazade Huseyin. Feyzullah Efendi had his son Fethullah Efendi given an appointment that would have given him the post of Sheik-ul-Islam when his father left the post. The appointment of a sheikh-ul-Islam by dynastic rules was totally unprecedented but Amcazade Huseyin had little choice in the matter. From then onwards whenever the state under Amcazade Huseyin started affecting adversely his interests, Feyzullah Efendi was able to intervene and stop the application of such a policy. In July 1701 Mezzo Morto Huseyin Pasha, who was an ally of Amcazade Huseyin, died and the delicate power balance between Istanbul and Edirne tipped towards Feyzullah Efendi in Edirne. This frustrated Amcazade Huseyin Pasha so much, that his serious illness is attributed to this helplessness.

He was known to be concerned with the needs of the common people as well as those of the military and bureaucratic classes.\n\n==Earlier years==\nAmcazade Huseyin was born in 1644 and was the son of [[Hasan A\u011fa Kypriljoti]], the brother of [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha]], and for this reason he has the cognonom of \"amcazade (nephew)\". We have little of his youth and education. His father had agricultural estates at the Turkish village of \"Kozluca\" in present-day [[Bulgaria]] and young Huseyin spent his youth there. He must have had a good Ottoman classical scribal or military education, since because when he is first mentioned he is a staff officer. He participated at the campaign for Siege of Vienna at 1683, as a high staff officer in the Ottoman army since Ottomans were commanded by the Grand Vizier [[Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa Pasha]], who was his close relative. After the defeat of Ottomans at the [[Battle of Vienna]] and retreat to [[Belgrade]], Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa was executed and Amcazade Huseyin was arrested because of his close relationship to the executed commander. \n\nIn 1684 he was released from prison, but was sent away from the seat of power as an administrator of provinces with a rank of ''[[beylerbey]]''. First he was appointed as guard-governor of Cardak near [[Gallipoli]] at the [[Dardanelles]] Straits; then he was given the rank of [[vizier]] and given a similar but more prestigious job at [[Seddulbahir]]. In 1691 for a time he was appointed as the temporary governor (''[[kaimakam]]'' of Istanbul and returned to his main job on Dardanelles. On 1694 he was appointed the [[Kapudan Pasha]] (Ottoman admiral-in-chief) and was instrumental with the help of [[Mezzo Morto Huseyin Pasha]] in retaking of [[Chios]] from the Venetians in 1695. For this success he was appointed the governor of Chios. In 1696 he was again appointed as the temporary governor of Istanbul but soon was sent to the post of governorship of Belgrade. In August 1697 the Ottoman army under the command of Sultan [[Mustafa II]] was on the campaign against the Austrians and came to Belgrade. In a War Council planning on what to do next, Amcazade Huseyin Pasha proposed that the Ottoman army should go and put under siege the fortress of [[Vara\u017edin]]. However, others argued that it should go towards [[Timi\u015foara|Temesvar]]; their proposal was accepted and the Ottoman army was surprised and routed at the [[Battle of Zenta]].<ref name=\"aksit\">\"Amcazade H\u00fcseyin Pa\u015fa\" in Niyazi Aksit (1984)''A'dan Z'ye Tarih Ansiklopedisi (A to Z History Encyclopedia)'', Istanbul:Serhat Yayinlari p.55(Turkish)</ref>\n\nHis daughter married [[Kavanoz Ahmed Pasha]], who was grand vizier for a short time in 1703.<ref name=\"sicilli\">{{citation|author=Mehmet S\u00fcreyya|editor1=Nuri Akbayar|editor2=Seyit A.

He was given a promise by the Sultan that he would be free agent in his government of the Empire with no interference by the Sultan. It was hoped that during the negotiations for peace to take place at Karlowitz, he could use family ability to get best possible terms for the ending of the long war against the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League of 1684]], a coalition of European powers including the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the [[Republic of Venice]] and [[Peter I of Russia]]. After long months of negotiations the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] was signed on 26 January 1699. The Ottomans ceded to the Habsburg Monarchy, all of the Ottoman province of [[Hungary]] including [[Transylvania]] which was conquered after 1526; [[Podolia]] was returned to Poland and most of [[Dalmatia]] and [[Morea]] (the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula in southern Greece)  passed to Venice.
