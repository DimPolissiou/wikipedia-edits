The village of Winter Park was still in its infancy at this time, less than five years old, but both the incorporation of a railroad and the inaugural classes beginning at Rollins College in 1885 influenced the town's image as a desirable place to live. Intent on creating a [[lending library]] for the community, this ambitious group of women held a meeting at the Congregational Parsonage, which is now the location of the current Rollins campus, roughly where the Archibald Granville Bush Science Center sits today.\n\nThis was a time of male-only [[suffrage]], and women had to content themselves with more \u201cladylike\u201d pursuits, such as ministering to the needy and coming up with ideas for civic projects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> All elected officers of the [[circulating library]], however, would be women. The president was Mrs. Elizabeth P. Hooker, the wife of a doctor and Congregational minister, as well as a president of Rollins College. She was raised by a professor at [[Middlebury College]], where she received some advanced education and was likely familiar with the workings of a college library. The \u201ctwo Marys\u201d in the group, Mary McClure and Mary E. Brown, were both retired teachers. Brown would be remembered as being \"of a singularly acute and independent mind, a lover of the best books, a keen critic, and an unfailing source of intellectual stimulus to all who knew her.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> Alice Guild and her sister, Clara, came from Boston with their father in 1883. Alice, 25 at the time, was elected as fundraiser for the library, while her sister, Clara, albeit not one of the library's noted founders, was in her own right a member of the first class at Rollins and later received the college's first degree conferred upon a woman. Evaline Lamson was only 30 when she became the driving force behind the library's survival and for several years served simultaneously as librarian for the town library and the one at Rollins College. Little is known about the remaining members, Mrs. C. J. Ladd, Mrs. Clark, Mrs. Cook, and Mrs. W. O. Cady, except that the latter would become the first librarian for the Winter Park Circulating Library.\n\n[[File:Winter Park Public Library, 1902.jpg|thumb|Winter Park Public Library, 1902]]While deliberating and discussing details, the most crucial decision for the women was not how to get the necessary books, as they had been circulating books among themselves for some time, but where to base their new venture.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> The first site was the Lamson house at 503 Interlachen Avenue, and initially operating only on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Records for the year of 1887 gave some insight into what was being read that year, including ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'', ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', and ''[[The Rise of Silas Lapham]]''. Biographies were also popular, such as those on [[Frederick the Great]], and religious titles, ''The Blood of Jesus'', ''Thoughts on Personal Religion'', and ''Scientific Theism''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> Since the library shelves and inventory were limited, the rules for borrowing material were that members could take out one book on Wednesday and Saturday and keep it for two weeks, with a one-week renewal. They would impose a 10-cent fine for non-renewals, and those who were not members would be allowed to take out books if they paid a $1 deposit plus 10 cents for each week.\n\nOne year after the library's founding, as recorded in the minutes of the annual meeting held on December 16, 1886, the officers accepted an offer to move its operations from Miss Lamson's porch to a room in a building occupied by the [[Winter Park Company]] on the southwest corner of New England and Park Avenues. The Winter Park Circulating Library Association wrote its [[constitution]] in 1888.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nEconomic devastation would bring the library to the brink of closure in 1895. As it is today, Florida's two biggest commodities are citrus and tourism. Winter Park relied on winter visitors, but according to ''The History of Orlando'' by Eve Bacon, \u201cthe temperature dropped to 24 degrees the Sunday after Christmas Day in 1894,\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> and dropped even lower to an astounding 17 degrees in February. This hard freeze killed trees and citrus, and potential visitors to the area, hearing news of the record cold, decided not to visit. The blow to the area's economy was evident in the library's December 1895 annual meeting, where the treasurer's report revealed an existing balance of $8.60.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> In spite of this drop in profit, the overall bleak outlook of the time gave an unexpected boost in inventory, which may have been gifted books by families moving from the area. The population of Winter Park would fluctuate dramatically from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth, but the welcome addition of some wealthy new residents would bring relief via donations, which enabled the library to buy more books in 1896.\n\nIn 1900, discussion of what should be included in a new, permanent building effectively set the library's policy for years to come, as the decision was made to include a children's department. The Winter Park Circulating Library Association's president, Eleanora Comstock, called a meeting to propose plans and start fundraising efforts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> Pledges of $1,216 were received by February 1901, and land was donated by the estate of Francis Knowles. The library opened in April 1902.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> This also expanded hours of operation to every day. Fundraising consisted of outreach to the public and a financial commitment from the city government, which continues to this day.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nIndoor plumbing was not part of the original design of the new building in 1900, and in the absence of modern insulation, complaints about heat in the summer and cold in the winter are recorded aspects of its history.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nProsperity inevitably came back to the area due in part to both a revitalized citrus industry and the construction of the new [[Seminole Hotel]] in 1912 following a fire that had burned down the prior building, and had long been a great source of revenue for the library. Also, the town council agreed to provide free electricity to the library building in 1914. In light of these developments and donations, the library added a kitchen wing that same year, which inspired the ladies of the library to continue a series of teas, fundraising socials and other events of interest to potential patrons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> The library would eventually double in size in 1924 when they added two new wings and a [[Toilet (room)|lavatory]]. And by 1945, the library had a collection of 12,269 books and a circulation of 33,214.\n\nDespite the historical and commendable efforts behind the library's origin and contribution to the community of Winter Park during this time, it had remained somewhat of an exclusive group of patrons that many residents chose not to join. Furthermore, the library only served the white townspeople. A separate library was founded in the heart of the black residential community in mid-1937. Founded by Dr. Edwin O. Grover in 1937, the [[Hannibal Square Library]] was established for African American residents, dedicated in memory of his wife, who had been an activist in the cause of education and the black community.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> Initially functioning as an independent library, it began receiving regular appropriations from the city in the 1950s, albeit on a smaller scale than that received by the Winter Park Public Library. A children's room was added in 1955. A popular place for children and local organizations to meet, neighbors maintained the grounds, donated to the organization, and planted shrubbery and flowers to beautify it. The Board of Directors was composed of black and white residents. The Winter Park Public Library [[Racial integration|integrated]] in 1962 and 1963, adopting a policy of library service to all residents of Winter Park, irrespective of age, race, creed, color or financial situation. In 1979, the Hannibal Square Library was closed due to decline in circulation and the building and grounds were returned to the city's council.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it was initially proposed to simply build on to the existing library site, the issue of insufficient parking was the inspiration for constructing a new building on a different site. In September 1976, the city bought some land at 460 East New England Avenue, and in July 1977, the Library received a grant for construction on the site. Soon thereafter, the Winter Park Public Library opened with nearly twice the square footage and increased parking spaces from thirteen to sixty-five.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> The facility was expanded starting in 1994, adding a third floor to allow more space for services to patrons aged 12 to 18.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAgain, a lack of space to continue offering future-ready programming and an effective and sustainable library led to the 2016 initiative to create a new library building. In March 2016, voters passed an issuance of a $30 million bond referendum to finance the cost to construct this new facility. However, public opposition delayed the process for several years.

Cady, except that the latter would become the first librarian for the Winter Park Circulating Library. \n\n[[File:Winter Park Public Library, 1902.jpg|thumb|Winter Park Public Library, 1902]]While deliberating and discussing details, the most crucial decision for the women was not how to get the necessary books, as they had been circulating books among themselves for some time, but where to base their new venture.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> The first site was the Lamson house at 503 Interlachen Avenue, and initially operating only on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Records for the year of 1887 gave some insight into what was being read that year, including ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'', ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', and ''[[The Rise of Silas Lapham]]''. Biographies were also popular, such as those on [[Frederick the Great]], and religious titles, ''The Blood of Jesus'', ''Thoughts on Personal Religion'', and ''Scientific Theism''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> Since the library shelves and inventory were limited, the rules for borrowing material were that members could take out one book on Wednesday and Saturday and keep it for two weeks, with a one-week renewal. They would impose a 10-cent fine for non-renewals, and those who were not members would be allowed to take out books if they paid a $1 deposit plus 10 cents for each week.\n\nOne year after the library's founding, as recorded in the minutes of the annual meeting held on December 16, 1886, the officers accepted an offer to move its operations from Miss Lamson's porch to a room in a building occupied by the [[Winter Park Company]] on the southwest corner of New England and Park Avenues. The Winter Park Circulating Library Association wrote its [[constitution]] in 1888.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nEconomic devastation would bring the library to the brink of closure in 1895. As it is today, Florida's two biggest commodities are citrus and tourism. Winter Park relied on winter visitors, but according to ''The History of Orlando'' by Eve Bacon, \u201cthe temperature dropped to 24 degrees the Sunday after Christmas Day in 1894,\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> and dropped even lower to an astounding 17 degrees in February. This hard freeze killed trees and citrus, and potential visitors to the area, hearing news of the record cold, decided not to visit. The blow to the area's economy was evident in the library's December 1895 annual meeting, where the treasurer's report revealed an existing balance of $8.60.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> In spite of this drop in profit, the overall bleak outlook of the time gave an unexpected boost in inventory, which may have been gifted books by families moving from the area. The population of Winter Park would fluctuate dramatically from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth, but the welcome addition of some wealthy new residents would bring relief via donations, which enabled the library to buy more books in 1896. \n\nIn 1900, discussion of what should be included in a new, permanent building effectively set the library's policy for years to come, as the decision was made to include a children's department. The Winter Park Circulating Library Association's president, Eleanora Comstock, called a meeting to propose plans and start fundraising efforts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> Pledges of $1,216 were received by February 1901, and land was donated by the estate of Francis Knowles. The library opened in April 1902.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> This also expanded hours of operation to every day. Fundraising consisted of outreach to the public and a financial commitment from the city government, which continues to this day.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nIndoor plumbing was not part of the original design of the new building in 1900, and in the absence of modern insulation, complaints about heat in the summer and cold in the winter are recorded aspects of its history.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nProsperity inevitably came back to the area due in part to both a revitalized citrus industry and the construction of the new [[Seminole Hotel]] in 1912 following a fire that had burned down the prior building, and had long been a great source of revenue for the library. Also, the town council agreed to provide free electricity to the library building in 1914. In light of these developments and donations, the library added a kitchen wing that same year, which inspired the ladies of the library to continue a series of teas, fundraising socials and other events of interest to potential patrons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> The library would eventually double in size in 1924 when they added two new wings and a [[Toilet (room)|lavatory]]. And by 1945, the library had a collection of 12,269 books and a circulation of 33,214.\n\nDespite the historical and commendable efforts behind the library's origin and contribution to the community of Winter Park during this time, it had remained somewhat of an exclusive group of patrons that many residents chose not to join. Furthermore, the library only served the white townspeople. A separate library was founded in the heart of the black residential community in mid-1937. Founded by Dr. Edwin O. Grover in 1937, the [[Hannibal Square Library]] was established for African American residents, dedicated in memory of his wife, who had been an activist in the cause of education and the black community.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> Initially functioning as an independent library, it began receiving regular appropriations from the city in the 1950s, albeit on a smaller scale than that received by the Winter Park Public Library. A children's room was added in 1955. A popular place for children and local organizations to meet, neighbors maintained the grounds, donated to the organization, and planted shrubbery and flowers to beautify it. The Board of Directors was composed of black and white residents. The Winter Park Public Library [[Racial integration|integrated]] in 1962 and 1963, adopting a policy of library service to all residents of Winter Park, irrespective of age, race, creed, color or financial situation. In 1979, the Hannibal Square Library was closed due to decline in circulation and the building and grounds were returned to the city's council.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it was initially proposed to simply build on to the existing library site, the issue of insufficient parking was the inspiration for constructing a new building on a different site. In September 1976, the city bought some land at 460 East New England Avenue, and in July 1977, the Library received a grant for construction on the site. Soon thereafter, the Winter Park Public Library opened with nearly twice the square footage and increased parking spaces from thirteen to sixty-five.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> The facility was expanded starting in 1994, adding a third floor to allow more space for services to patrons aged 12 to 18.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAgain, a lack of space to continue offering future-ready programming and an effective and sustainable library led to the 2016 initiative to create a new library building. In March 2016, voters passed an issuance of a $30 million bond referendum to finance the cost to construct this new facility. However, public opposition delayed the process for several years. As of 2019, <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/orange-county/os-ne-winter-park-library-construction-plans-20190513-5pemv6aezvcs5etm6f2njbb4ra-story.html|title=Winter Park rejects hitting \u2018pause button\u2019 on $40.5M library and events center|last=Garza|first=Lisa Maria|website=orlandosentinel.com|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> Canopy, a massive campus in Winter Park with a 35,690-square-foot library and a 13,456-square-foot events center is set to open in May 2021.

In 1976, Bacon donated her numerous files of Winter Park information to the Winter Park Public Library and set into motion the active acquisition and preservation of materials pertaining to the city of Winter Park and its residents. The collection continues to grow through the library's own acquisition efforts and the generous donations from members of the community. In the pursuit of preserving Winter Park's rich history, the collection includes maps, photographs, newspaper clippings, periodicals, scrapbooks, city government records, books, pamphlets, and correspondence.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Simmons|first1=Rachel|title=About Our Collection|url=http://archive.wppl.org/wphistory/overview.html|website=Winter Park History|publisher=Winter Park Public Library}}</ref> \n\n*The Winter Park History and Archives Collection acts as a depository for the DAR Scrapbooks documenting the activities of the [[William Pope Duval]] Chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]][http://www.williampduvalchapternsdar.org/chapter-historyorganized], established May 15, 1957.
