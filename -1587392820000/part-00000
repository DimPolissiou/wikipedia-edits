Since being formed in 1909 as Dundee Hibernian, the club has employed a [[Manager (association football)|manager]] to run the team, the first being [[Pat Reilly]]. The club's longest serving and most successful manager is [[Jim McLean]], who held the position from 1971 to 1993 and won three major honours \u2013 the [[Scottish Football League Premier Division]] title in [[1982-83 Scottish Premier Division|1982-83]] and consecutive [[Scottish League Cup]] wins in [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (December)|1979]] and [[1980 Scottish League Cup Final|1980]]. Two Dundee United managers have won the [[Scottish Cup]] \u2013 [[Ivan Golac]] in [[1994 Scottish Cup Final|1994]] and [[Peter Houston]] in [[2010 Scottish Cup Final|2010]].\n\n==Managerial history==\n{{see also|History of Dundee United F.C.}}\nDundee Hibernian's first manager, [[Pat Reilly]], had no previous background in professional football, but was one of a group of local businessmen who had set up the club. Initially the role was \"secretary-manager\", with the emphasis as much on the administrative business of the club as on running the football team.<ref name=\"Cent269\">Rundo & Watson, p.269</ref> Reilly had a flair for publicity, and under him the club successfully applied for membership of the [[Scottish Football League]] in 1910.<ref>Rundo & Watson, p.11</ref> Apart from a two-year spell during the First World War when he was replaced by the club's first [[player-manager]], [[Herbert Dainty]], Reilly remained in the role until 1922, shortly before the club was reorganised as Dundee United.<ref name=\"Cent269\" />\n\nFormer [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] goalkeeper [[Jimmy Brownlie]] was the club's most successful manager in the interwar period. He had three spells in charge, the last as co-manager with [[Sam Irving]]. Under Brownlie, United won the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Division Two]] title in the [[1924-25 Scottish Second Division|1924-25 season]], their first national honour, and entered the top flight of Scottish football for the first time. Although relegated in 1927, they won the Second Division again in [[1928-29 Scottish Second Division|1928-29]] and were promoted for a third time in [[1930-31 Scottish Second Division|1930-31]], shortly before the end of Brownlie's first spell as manager.<ref>Rundo & Watson, p.265</ref>\n\nPrior to the appointment of former player [[Jerry Kerr]] as manager in 1959, Dundee United had spent only four seasons in [[Scottish Football League First Division|Division One]], and had been absent from it since 1932. After winning promotion in Kerr's first season in charge, the club became established in the top flight of Scottish football, and {{as of|2015|lc=yes}} have spent only one further season below it. Under Kerr, United reached their first major national semi-final in 1963 and qualified for European competition for the first time in 1966, recording a notable victory over [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|Fairs Cup]] holders [[CF Barcelona|Barcelona]]. Kerr retired as manager in 1971, to be replaced by [[Jim McLean]].<ref name=\"Cent267\">Rundo & Watson, p.267</ref>\n\n[[File:Mixu Paatelainen.jpg|thumb|[[Mixu Paatelainen]] was in charge from October 2015 to May 2016, with the title of head coach]]\nBuilding on Kerr's achievements, McLean instituted a successful youth policy that set the foundations for future success. The club won their first major honour, the [[Scottish League Cup]], in [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (December)|1979]] and retained the trophy in [[1980 Scottish League Cup Final|1980]]. The club became champions of Scotland for the first time when they won the [[Scottish Football League Premier Division]] title in [[1982-83 Scottish Premier Division|1982-83]]. During the 1980s, McLean's United teams regularly made significant progress in European competitions, reaching the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] semi-finals in [[1983-84 European Cup|1984]] and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] final in [[1987 UEFA Cup Final|1987]]. Under McLean, however, Dundee United developed a reputation for failing in major finals at [[Hampden Park]]; he never won the [[Scottish Cup]], losing six finals, whilst there were also two League Cup final defeats.<ref name=\"Cent268\">Rundo & Watson, p.268</ref>\n \nMcLean spent 21 years as manager of Dundee United until his retirement in 1993, becoming the club's longest serving manager. At that point, the club had had only two managers in a 34-year period, but since then have had a much higher turnover. [[Robbie Neilson]], appointed in October 2018, is the club's sixteenth manager in the 25 years since McLean. Up until 2000, McLean himself had chosen his successors, having become club chairman in 1988 and initially combining this role with that of manager, a unique situation in Scottish football.<ref name=\"Cent268\" /> His immediate successor, [[Ivan Golac]], won the previously elusive Scottish Cup in [[1994 Scottish Cup Final|1994]], but he left the club the following year shortly before United were relegated after 35 years in the top flight.<ref>Rundo & Watson, p.266</ref> Promotion back to the Premier Division was won under [[Billy Kirkwood]],<ref name=\"Cent267\" /> who was followed as manager by [[Tommy McLean]], the chairman's brother.<ref name=\"Cent267\" /> Dundee United won the Scottish Cup for a second time in [[2010 Scottish Cup Final|2010]], under [[Peter Houston]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Dundee Utd   3 - 0   Ross County|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/8682861.stm|accessdate=3 June 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=15 May 2010}}</ref> Other managers to have taken the club to major cup finals are Tommy McLean, [[Gordon Chisholm]], [[Craig Levein]] and [[Jackie McNamara]].\n\n==List==\n''Managerial dates are sourced from Rundo & Watson (2009) and Soccerbase.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dundee United Managers|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=740&comp_id=12&teamTabs=managers|website=Soccerbase|publisher=Centurycomm|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> Statistics are taken from the Arab Archive website<ref>{{cite web|title=Club Managers|url=http://www.arabarchive.co.uk/managers.php|website=Arab Archive|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> and include all national and international competitions.

Initially the role was \"secretary-manager\", with the emphasis as much on the administrative business of the club as on running the football team.<ref name=\"Cent269\">Rundo & Watson, p.269</ref> Reilly had a flair for publicity, and under him the club successfully applied for membership of the [[Scottish Football League]] in 1910.<ref>Rundo & Watson, p.11</ref> Apart from a two-year spell during the First World War when he was replaced by the club's first [[player-manager]], [[Herbert Dainty]], Reilly remained in the role until 1922, shortly before the club was reorganised as Dundee United.<ref name=\"Cent269\" />\n\nFormer [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] goalkeeper [[Jimmy Brownlie]] was the club's most successful manager in the interwar period. He had three spells in charge, the last as co-manager with [[Sam Irving]]. Under Brownlie, United won the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Division Two]] title in the [[1924-25 Scottish Second Division|1924-25 season]], their first national honour, and entered the top flight of Scottish football for the first time. Although relegated in 1927, they won the Second Division again in [[1928-29 Scottish Second Division|1928-29]] and were promoted for a third time in [[1930-31 Scottish Second Division|1930-31]], shortly before the end of Brownlie's first spell as manager.<ref>Rundo & Watson, p.265</ref>\n\nPrior to the appointment of former player [[Jerry Kerr]] as manager in 1959, Dundee United had spent only four seasons in [[Scottish Football League First Division|Division One]], and had been absent from it since 1932. After winning promotion in Kerr's first season in charge, the club became established in the top flight of Scottish football, and {{as of|2015|lc=yes}} have spent only one further season below it. Under Kerr, United reached their first major national semi-final in 1963 and qualified for European competition for the first time in 1966, recording a notable victory over [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|Fairs Cup]] holders [[CF Barcelona|Barcelona]]. Kerr retired as manager in 1971, to be replaced by [[Jim McLean]].<ref name=\"Cent267\">Rundo & Watson, p.267</ref>\n\n[[File:Mixu Paatelainen.jpg|thumb|[[Mixu Paatelainen]] was in charge from October 2015 to May 2016, with the title of head coach]]\nBuilding on Kerr's achievements, McLean instituted a successful youth policy that set the foundations for future success. The club won their first major honour, the [[Scottish League Cup]], in [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (December)|1979]] and retained the trophy in [[1980 Scottish League Cup Final|1980]]. The club became champions of Scotland for the first time when they won the [[Scottish Football League Premier Division]] title in [[1982-83 Scottish Premier Division|1982-83]]. During the 1980s, McLean's United teams regularly made significant progress in European competitions, reaching the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] semi-finals in [[1983-84 European Cup|1984]] and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] final in [[1987 UEFA Cup Final|1987]]. Under McLean, however, Dundee United developed a reputation for failing in major finals at [[Hampden Park]]; he never won the [[Scottish Cup]], losing six finals, whilst there were also two League Cup final defeats.<ref name=\"Cent268\">Rundo & Watson, p.268</ref>\n \nMcLean spent 21 years as manager of Dundee United until his retirement in 1993, becoming the club's longest serving manager. At that point, the club had had only two managers in a 34-year period, but since then have had a much higher turnover. [[Robbie Neilson]], appointed in October 2018, is the club's sixteenth manager in the 25 years since McLean. Up until 2000, McLean himself had chosen his successors, having become club chairman in 1988 and initially combining this role with that of manager, a unique situation in Scottish football.<ref name=\"Cent268\" /> His immediate successor, [[Ivan Golac]], won the previously elusive Scottish Cup in [[1994 Scottish Cup Final|1994]], but he left the club the following year shortly before United were relegated after 35 years in the top flight.<ref>Rundo & Watson, p.266</ref> Promotion back to the Premier Division was won under [[Billy Kirkwood]],<ref name=\"Cent267\" /> who was followed as manager by [[Tommy McLean]], the chairman's brother.<ref name=\"Cent267\" /> Dundee United won the Scottish Cup for a second time in [[2010 Scottish Cup Final|2010]], under [[Peter Houston]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Dundee Utd   3 - 0   Ross County|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/8682861.stm|accessdate=3 June 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=15 May 2010}}</ref> Other managers to have taken the club to major cup finals are Tommy McLean, [[Gordon Chisholm]], [[Craig Levein]] and [[Jackie McNamara]].\n\n==List==\n''Managerial dates are sourced from Rundo & Watson (2009) and Soccerbase.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dundee United Managers|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=740&comp_id=12&teamTabs=managers|website=Soccerbase|publisher=Centurycomm|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> Statistics are taken from the Arab Archive website<ref>{{cite web|title=Club Managers|url=http://www.arabarchive.co.uk/managers.php|website=Arab Archive|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> and include all national and international competitions.

They were the best aircraft of this type available to the {{lang|fr|[[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]}} at the outbreak of the war, with speed, altitude and manoeuvrability that allowed them to evade interception by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]]. Although the aircraft could have been in service by [[1937 in aviation|1937]], debate over what role to give the aircraft delayed deliveries until [[1940 in aviation|1940]]. Too few in number to make any measurable impact on the [[Battle of France]], they continued in service with the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] forces after the armistice. The MB.174 is notable as the aircraft flown by [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]], author of ''[[The Little Prince]]'' during the campaign. His work {{lang|fr|Pilote de Guerre}} (''[[Flight to Arras]]''), published in 1942, is based on a 1940 reconnaissance mission in this type of aircraft.\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Bloch MB-170 schematics.svg|thumb|Bloch MB.170 schematics]]\nIn [[1936 in aviation|1936]], the Ministry for the Air initiated a programme of modernisation of French aviation which included a request concerning a two- or three-seat multi-role aircraft that could be used as a light-bomber or attack aircraft or for reconnaissance. A design team at the former [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Avions Marcel Bloch|Bloch]] factory at [[Courbevoie]] (which had recently become part of the nationalised [[SNCASO]]), led by Henri Deplante, proposed the '''MB.170''', a twin-engined, low-winged [[Cantilever#Aircraft|cantilever]] [[monoplane]].<ref name=\"Greenv7 p107\">Green 1967, p. 107.</ref><ref name=\"Breffort v1 p46\">Breffort and Jouineau 2004, p. 46.</ref>\n\nThe first prototype, the '''MB 170 AB2-A3 No.01''', equipped as a two-seat attack bomber or a three-seat reconnaissance aircraft, made its maiden flight on 15 February 1938.<ref name=\"Greenv7 p107\"/> It was powered by two {{convert|970|hp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14N]] [[radial engine]]s and was armed with a 20&nbsp;mm Hispano-Suiza cannon in the nose, two 7.5&nbsp;mm [[MAC 1934]] machine guns in the wing, with another machine gun flexibly mounted in the rear cockpit, with a ventral cupola housing either a rearward firing machine gun or a camera.<ref name=\"Greenv7 p107-8\">Green 1967, pp. 107\u2013108.</ref> The second prototype, the '''MB 170 B3 No.2''' was a three seat bomber, with the ventral cupola removed, a revised canopy and larger tail fins.<ref name=\"Greenv7 p108-9\">Green 1967, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref>\n\nAfter many modifications it became the definitive '''MB.174'''. After the 50th example was delivered in May 1940, the '''MB.175''' succeeded the MB.174 on the assembly lines in full flow. This bomber version, had a redesigned [[bomb bay]] capable of carrying bombs of 100\u2013200&nbsp;kg (220-440&nbsp;lb), where the MB.174 was limited to 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;lb) bombs. The MB.175's [[fuselage]] was lengthened and widened to accommodate this greater capacity but only 25 were delivered before the armistice. They were eventually used in the same reconnaissance units as the MB.174s. The '''MB.176''' was a version with [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830]] [[radial engine]]s which proved to have poorer performance than the MB.175. It was ordered into production to ease demand on the French engine manufacturers.\n\n==Operational history==\nThe Bloch MB.174 flew for the first time in July [[1939 in aviation|1939]] and entered service in March [[1940 in aviation|1940]] with strategic reconnaissance units where it replaced the [[Potez 637]] that had proved too vulnerable during the [[Phoney war]]. Its first operational mission was flown by the famed pilot and writer, {{lang|fr|Capitaine}} [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]], of {{lang|fr|Groupe de Reconnaissance}} II/33, on 29 March 1940. The Bloch 174 appeared extremely effective in these missions as its speed and manoeuvrability at altitude allowed it to escape from most modern {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} fighters. Only three examples were lost to enemy fire during the Battle of France. Like the majority of the modern equipment of the {{lang|fr|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air}} during the campaign, they were too little and too late. At the time of the [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice]], most surviving MB.174s and 175s had been evacuated to [[North Africa]]. A few were recovered by the Germans and then used for pilot training. During the [[Vichy France|Vichy period]], MB.174s frequently flew over [[Gibraltar]] to monitor the British fleet.\n\nIn March [[1941 in aviation|1941]], German engineers used engines taken from MB.175s (as well as other captured aircraft) to propel the [[Messerschmitt Me 323]] cargo aircraft, some of which flew with parts taken from completed MB.175s.

They were the best aircraft of this type available to the {{lang|fr|[[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]}} at the outbreak of the war, with speed, altitude and manoeuvrability that allowed them to evade interception by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]]. Although the aircraft could have been in service by [[1937 in aviation|1937]], debate over what role to give the aircraft delayed deliveries until [[1940 in aviation|1940]]. Too few in number to make any measurable impact on the [[Battle of France]], they continued in service with the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] forces after the armistice. The MB.174 is notable as the aircraft flown by [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]], author of ''[[The Little Prince]]'' during the campaign. His work {{lang|fr|Pilote de Guerre}} (''[[Flight to Arras]]''), published in 1942, is based on a 1940 reconnaissance mission in this type of aircraft.\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Bloch MB-170 schematics.svg|thumb|Bloch MB.170 schematics]]\nIn [[1936 in aviation|1936]], the Ministry for the Air initiated a programme of modernisation of French aviation which included a request concerning a two- or three-seat multi-role aircraft that could be used as a light-bomber or attack aircraft or for reconnaissance. A design team at the former [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Avions Marcel Bloch|Bloch]] factory at [[Courbevoie]] (which had recently become part of the nationalised [[SNCASO]]), led by Henri Deplante, proposed the '''MB.170''', a twin-engined, low-winged [[Cantilever#Aircraft|cantilever]] [[monoplane]].<ref name=\"Greenv7 p107\">Green 1967, p. 107.</ref><ref name=\"Breffort v1 p46\">Breffort and Jouineau 2004, p. 46.</ref>\n\nThe first prototype, the '''MB 170 AB2-A3 No.01''', equipped as a two-seat attack bomber or a three-seat reconnaissance aircraft, made its maiden flight on 15 February 1938.<ref name=\"Greenv7 p107\"/> It was powered by two {{convert|970|hp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14N]] [[radial engine]]s and was armed with a 20&nbsp;mm Hispano-Suiza cannon in the nose, two 7.5&nbsp;mm [[MAC 1934]] machine guns in the wing, with another machine gun flexibly mounted in the rear cockpit, with a ventral cupola housing either a rearward firing machine gun or a camera.<ref name=\"Greenv7 p107-8\">Green 1967, pp. 107\u2013108.</ref> The second prototype, the '''MB 170 B3 No.2''' was a three seat bomber, with the ventral cupola removed, a revised canopy and larger tail fins.<ref name=\"Greenv7 p108-9\">Green 1967, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref>\n\nAfter many modifications it became the definitive '''MB.174'''. After the 50th example was delivered in May 1940, the '''MB.175''' succeeded the MB.174 on the assembly lines in full flow. This bomber version, had a redesigned [[bomb bay]] capable of carrying bombs of 100\u2013200&nbsp;kg (220-440&nbsp;lb), where the MB.174 was limited to 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;lb) bombs. The MB.175's [[fuselage]] was lengthened and widened to accommodate this greater capacity but only 25 were delivered before the armistice. They were eventually used in the same reconnaissance units as the MB.174s. The '''MB.176''' was a version with [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830]] [[radial engine]]s which proved to have poorer performance than the MB.175. It was ordered into production to ease demand on the French engine manufacturers.\n\n==Operational history==\nThe Bloch MB.174 flew for the first time in July [[1939 in aviation|1939]] and entered service in March [[1940 in aviation|1940]] with strategic reconnaissance units where it replaced the [[Potez 637]] that had proved too vulnerable during the [[Phoney war]]. Its first operational mission was flown by the famed pilot and writer, {{lang|fr|Capitaine}} [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]], of {{lang|fr|Groupe de Reconnaissance}} II/33, on 29 March 1940. The Bloch 174 appeared extremely effective in these missions as its speed and manoeuvrability at altitude allowed it to escape from most modern {{lang|deLuftwaffe}} fighters. Only three examples were lost to enemy fire during the Battle of France. Like the majority of the modern equipment of the {{lang|fr|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air}} during the campaign, they were too little and too late. At the time of the [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice]], most surviving MB.174s and 175s had been evacuated to [[North Africa]]. A few were recovered by the Germans and then used for pilot training. During the [[Vichy France|Vichy period]], MB.174s frequently flew over [[Gibraltar]] to monitor the British fleet.\n\nIn March [[1941 in aviation|1941]], German engineers used engines taken from MB.175s (as well as other captured aircraft) to propel the [[Messerschmitt Me 323]] cargo aircraft, some of which flew with parts taken from completed MB.175s. After [[Operation Torch]], French forces defected again from Vichy back to the Allies and surviving examples of the MB.170 flew their final combat missions during the [[Battle of Tunisia]].  They were replaced by reconnaissance variants of the [[P-38 Lightning]] and used as transports and [[target tug]]s. A final version designed for [[torpedo bomber|torpedo bombing]], the '''MB.175T''', was built in small series in [[1947 in aviation|1947]] and served with the {{lang|fr|[[A\u00e9ronavale]]}} until [[1950 in aviation|1950]].\n\n==Variants==\n;MB.170\n:'''MB.170.01''' - The first [[prototype]], equipped as reconnaissance aircraft, powered by [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14N-06]] engines.\n:'''MB.170.02''' - The second prototype, equipped as [[light bomber]], powered by [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14N-06]] engines.\n;MB.171:\n;MB.172:\n;MB.173:\n;MB.174\n:'''MB.174.01''' - The original MB.174 prototype, powered by [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14N-49]] engines.\n:'''MB.174A.3''' - Original production version, powered by [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14N-49]] engines.. 56 built\n\n;MB.175\n:'''MB.175.01''' - The original MB.175 prototype, powered by [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14N-48]] engines.\n:'''MB.175B.3''' - Second production version. 23 built, plus 56 unarmed aircraft for the ''Luftwaffe'', powered by [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14N-48]] engines.\n;MB.175T\n:Post-war torpedo bomber version for the ''Aeronavale''. 80 built.\n;MB.176\n:'''MB.176.01''' - The original MB.176 prototype, powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830 SC 3-G]] Twin Wasp engines.\n:'''MB.176B.3''' - Production version. 5 built\n;MB.177\n:Single prototype, powered by two [[Hispano-Suiza 12Y-31]] inline engines.\n;MB.178\n:Further development , construction halted by arrival of German forces.\n\n==Operators==\n;{{FRA}}\n* [[French Air Force]] ( Groupes de Reconnaissance 1/33, 2/33, 1/52 and 2/36)\n* [[Aeronavale|French Navy]]''\n;{{flag|Germany|Nazi}}\n* [[Luftwaffe]] (captured)\n\n==Specifications (MB.174A.3)==\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=War Planes of the Second World War: Volume Seven Bombers and Reconnaissance Aircraft<ref name=\"Greenv7 p115\">Green 1967, p. 114.</ref>\n|prime units?=met\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|crew=3\n|length m=12.23\n|length note=\n|span m=17.92\n|span note=\n|height m=3.55\n|height note=\n|wing area sqm=38\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=<!-- sailplanes -->\n|airfoil=<!--'''root:''' [[NACA airfoil|NACA]] ;

Although no direct narrative connections exist to previous ''Xeno'' games, it incorporates aesthetic and narrative elements from both [[Science fantasy|fantasy and science fiction]]. The game features navigation through an [[open world]] split into zones, side-quests tied to party members' affinity, and a real-time action-based battle system which incorporates the main character's ability to see glimpses of the future.\n\n''Xenoblade Chronicles'' takes place on the frozen bodies of two warring titans, the Bionis and the Mechonis. The people of Bionis, including the human-like Homs, are in a [[perpetual war]] with the Mechon machine race of Mechonis. Key to the Homs' efforts in fighting against the Mechon army is the Monado, a sword that is said to have been wielded by the Bionis. During an attack on his colony, the main protagonist [[Shulk]] discovers his ability to wield the Monado and sets out on a quest for revenge with his best friend, Reyn, with others joining in as the game progresses.\n\nThe concept for ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' originated in June 2006 when the game's executive director and lead writer, [[Tetsuya Takahashi]], visualized and then constructed a model of two giant gods frozen in place with people living on their bodies. Development began in 2007 under the title ''Monado: The Beginning of the World'', though it was eventually rebranded with its current title in honor of Takahashi's previous work. The script was worked on by Takahashi, anime writer Yuichiro Takeda, and Nintendo writer Yurie Hattori. The music was handled by six different composers, including first-timer and lead composer Manami Kiyota and industry veterans [[Yoko Shimomura]] and [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], with the latter writing the ending theme.\n\nThe game was announced in 2009 under its original title and released in Japan the following year. Despite releasing in Europe and in Oceania, its North American release remained unconfirmed until December 2011, during which time a fan campaign called [[Operation Rainfall]] drew considerable attention to the game. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim as one of the best recent role-playing games, while its New Nintendo 3DS port was praised for successfully re-creating the game in portable form. It also met with commercial success in both Japan and the West. A [[spiritual successor]] by the same development team for the [[Wii U]], ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles X]]'', was released in 2015.<!--No exact dates; per WP:VG/DATE--> A sequel for the Nintendo Switch, ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles 2]]'', was released in 2017.<!--No exact dates; per WP:VG/DATE-->\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Xenoblade-Landscape.jpg|thumb|left|Shulk (middle) and Reyn on the Bionis' Leg.

Battle Arts are only available after a \"cool down\" period that occurs after every use, while character specific \"Talent Arts\" only become available after enough auto-attacks are executed.<ref name=\"ignwhy\"/> Both party members and enemies have a finite amount of [[health points]], and attacks deplete this value. Combat is won when all enemies lose their HP, but the game is lost if the player's character loses all their HP and has no means of being revived. Health may be restored by the player by using healing Arts in battle, or the player may let characters' HP regenerate automatically outside of battle. Winning battles earns the player [[experience points]], which allows the characters to grow stronger by [[leveling up]] and learning new Arts. Arts for each character must be set by the player on their respective set up, called a  \"Battle Palette\", outside battles.<ref name=\"XenoManual\"/><ref name=\"1upbattle\">{{cite web|last=Gifford|first=Kevin|title=All About Xenoblade's Fighting System|url=http://www.1up.com/news/xenoblade-fighting-system|website=[[1UP.com]]|date=19 May 2010|accessdate=4 June 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dizrYxf2?url=http://www.1up.com/news/xenoblade-fighting-system|archivedate=12 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSeveral other systems are present to affect the flow of battle. The \"Party Gauge\" slowly fills as party members successfully land hits on the enemy players, and filling the gauge allows the player to chain multiple attacks together, for extra damage.<ref name=\"1upbattle\"/> All party members have an \"aggro ring\" around them as well; the more actions a character performs, the larger it grows. Larger aggro rings lead enemies to focus their efforts on that respective character, leading to a strategic aspect of luring and diverting attention of enemies.<ref name=\"ignwhy\"/> Each character has a \"Tension\" gauge, which represents a character's morale: at its highest point, characters have a high probability of dealing a critical blow and less chance of missing an enemy.<ref name=\"XenoManual\"/> The game's \"Vision\" system, where main character [[Shulk]] can see glimpses of enemies' future attacks, also factors into battles. With knowledge of an enemy's potentially dangerous attack, the player can prevent it from happening by alerting a teammate, allowing the player to activate one of their Arts, or by using an Art of their own to stop the attack.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sahdev|first=Ishaan|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2010/05/23/see-xenoblades-vision-battle-system-in-action/|title=See Xenoblade's Vision Battle System In Action|publisher=Siliconera|date=23 May 2010|accessdate=24 October 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6djGA1Zrr?url=http://www.siliconera.com/2010/05/23/see-xenoblades-vision-battle-system-in-action/|archivedate=12 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The Vision system is tied to the \"Party\" gauge, which is filled by boosting team morale, using Arts with special effects, and avoiding or dealing critical hits. The three-tiered gauge gradually depletes outside of battle, and one tier is needed to either revive characters or alert a teammate to a vision. When all three tiers are full, the party can execute a chain attack.<ref name=\"XenoManual\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting and characters===\nThe setting of ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' originates in a world that was nothing but endless ocean until two titanic gods, the Bionis and the Mechonis,{{efn|Respectively called the {{nihongo|Kyoshin|\u5de8\u795e||lit. \"Giant-God\"}} and {{nihongo|Kishin|\u6a5f\u795e||lit. \"Machine-God\"}} in the Japanese version.}} came into existence and battled each other until only their frozen corpses remained.

Takahashi had previously worked in the 1990s on ''[[Xenogears]]'', then on the ''[[Xenosaga]]'' trilogy after founding Monolith Soft in 1999.

Takahashi was responsible for creating the main concept, but as he was going to be director and executive producer, he was unable to also take on full script-writing duties, so he asked Takeda to be his partner in creating the scenario. Takeda was a writer for anime who had previously collaborated with Takahashi on adaptations of the [[Xenosaga Episode I|first ''Xenosaga'' game]], in addition to writing the script for ''[[Xenosaga I & II]]'', the [[Nintendo DS]] remake of ''Xenosaga'' and [[Xenosaga Episode II|its sequel]]. Takahashi deliberately chose someone outside the video game industry as he wanted a different perspective on the story's pacing.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> Hattori was brought in during the early development stages due to her experience with scenarios for Nintendo games, which enabled her to look at Takahashi and Takeda's scenario from an objective viewpoint.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiDev\"/> A key element in the scenario was contrasting senses of scale, which Takahashi described as \"contrasting the realms of the micro and the macro\", while the main story themes were characters embarking on a great and evolving journey, and overcoming a predetermined future.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/><ref name=\"GI3dInterview\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/15/interview-inside-the-development-of-xenoblade-chronicles-3ds.aspx|title=Interview: Inside The Development Of Xenoblade Chronicles 3DS|last1=Helgeson|first1=Matt|last2=Wallace|first2=Kimberley|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|date=15 April 2015|accessdate=15 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020200105/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/15/interview-inside-the-development-of-xenoblade-chronicles-3ds.aspx|archivedate=20 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite multiple fantasy elements, ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' is based within a science fiction premise, although such elements were kept low-key during the first part of the game.<ref name=\"NinXen3DS\"/><ref>{{cite book|date=24 July 2010|script-title=ja:\u30bc\u30ce\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u3000\u30b6\u30fb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9|trans-title=Xenoblade: The Complete Guide|publisher=[[ASCII Media Works]]|page=285|isbn = 978-4-04-868841-3}}</ref>\n\nDespite their earlier work together, it was the first time Takahashi and Takeda were so intimately involved in a project. Takeda found working on the project more difficult than he initially anticipated: his standard writing form was for the anime series format, which was limited to 20-25 minute episodes. With ''Xenoblade Chronicles'', the volume of story and writing work was much larger and offered more freedom for dramatic expression. Conversely, his previous experience enabled Takahashi to easily plan the structure and scheduling for the game. During the initial writing stages, Takahashi did not give precise instructions to Takeda: he instead gave a rough outline that they worked on together, then they passed the developing script between themselves, along with producers Shingo Kawabata and Koh Kojima, to iron out rough elements. Takahashi compared it to playing a game of catch, something he was unused to doing for his game scenarios.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> The ending underwent revisions: while Takahashi and Takeda felt they had created a fairly explanatory ending, Hattori still felt unsatisfied. After a second look, Takahashi and Takeda realized that it would appear perplexing for someone outside the writing process, so they rewrote it to be more player-friendly.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiDev\"/> The final script contained a large amount of dialogue: the sheer volume, which included dialogue spoken in battle, made for a difficult experience while recording. Due to all the effort, Takahashi was emphatic that as much of it as possible be used, although he sometimes felt that there was too much. In the end, some dialogue needed to be cut as testers felt that the characters talked too much.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> Takahashi's overall writing style was made deliberately more mature and subdued than other games within the genre.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/06/five-questions-with-xenoblade-chronicles-39-executive-director.aspx|title=Five Questions With Xenoblade Chronicles' Executive Director|last1=Juba|first1=Joe|last2=Kollar|first2=Phil|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=15 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215853/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/06/five-questions-with-xenoblade-chronicles-39-executive-director.aspx|archivedate=4 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOne of the elements that was of great concern to both Takahashi and Takeda was the main protagonist Shulk. Takahashi had noticed that, in the majority of RPGs, the main protagonist was all too easily disliked even if other characters became fan favorites. Consequently, one of the main priorities was to make Shulk as appealing as possible to players. During this process, it was suggested that Shulk be a [[silent protagonist]], but there was a general wish from the staff for him to speak. In addition to this, Takahashi needed to confront the problem faced in any RPG with voiced characters, which was developing them suitably and writing appropriate dialogue between them. The companion character Riki was cited by Takeda as a favorite of his: on paper Riki sounded an unlikable character, but his voice and appearance acted as a counterbalance to his remarks.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> One of the scenes where Hattori had input was a scene between Shulk and Fiora which showcased their connection: the original scene had Shulk touching Fiora's cheek, which Harrori felt would look \"creepy\" coming out of the blue. The scene was altered so Shulk touched her hand instead.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiDev\"/> One of the early concepts Takeda suggested was that one of the main protagonist's party would betray them and become the final boss, but Takahashi rejected this idea as he felt it would run counter to player expectation.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> During the course of its development, the story underwent so many revisions that Takahashi forgot what his original concept was, although the basic framework remained intact throughout.<ref name=\"SilDevelopment\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe original score for ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' was composed by Manami Kiyota, ACE+ (a musical production group composed of Tomori Kudo, Hiroyo \"CHiCO\" Yamanaka, and Kenji Hiramatsu), and [[Yoko Shimomura]].<ref name=\"XenoLiners\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/xenobladesliners/|title=Xenoblade Chronicles Original Soundtrack Liner Notes|publisher=Video Game Music Online|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=12 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604225053/http://www.vgmonline.net/xenobladesliners/|archivedate=4 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"1UPmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/xenoblade-music-dissected|title=Xenoblade's Music Dissected|last=Gifford|first=Kevin|website=[[1UP.com]]|date=12 May 2010|accessdate=12 September 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6de7p1XO1?url=http://www.1up.com/news/xenoblade-music-dissected|archivedate=9 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> As with other parts of development, Takahashi was deeply involved, constantly rejecting pieces due to what he felt was not fitting for the game. He admitted that this was due to early samples he had given the team for his vision for the music, which they had followed too faithfully for his liking. At Takahashi's request, [[Nobuo Uematsu]]'s record label [[Dog Ear Records]] assisted with production.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiMusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Xenoblade-Chronicles/Vol-1-Sound/1-Six-Musicians-Together/1-Six-Musicians-Together-839481.html|title=Iwata Asks: Xenoblade Chronicles for Wii - Vol 1: Sound|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2011|accessdate=8 December 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZzYeartB?url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Xenoblade-Chronicles/Vol-1-Sound/1-Six-Musicians-Together/1-Six-Musicians-Together-839481.html|archivedate=13 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe music team was led by Shimomura, who was initially very confused by the odd naming of tracks, along with getting the opportunity of using sounds not normally used in compositions in her other projects, such as electric guitars.<ref name=\"XenoLiners\"/><ref name=\"1UPmusic\"/> Kiyota had only previously done superficial work on video game titles; she accepted Dog Ear Records' offer for her to compose music. ACE+ was recommended to Takahashi by Dog Ear Records. Kiyota handled environmental tracks, while ACE+ was in charge of battle tracks in addition to other musical pieces. The team's main goal was to create music that went beyond the typical sound of RPGs. In hindsight, Yamanaka attributed the harmony of the six composers' works to Takahashi's organization and overall direction.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiMusic\"/> The final score contained around ninety tracks. One of the hardest tracks for Shimomura was a nine-minute track that Takahashi requested to match with a movie scene.

They were requested for the job by Nintendo as the staff at Monolith Soft were already working on the next ''Xenoblade'' title.<ref name=\"NinXen3DS\"/><ref name=\"XenoGamespot\"/> Development on the port started between Autumn and Winter 2013 initially for the original [[Nintendo 3DS]], but initial testing showed that the original platform lacked the memory and power to effectively run the game, since the Wii's processing capabilities were greater than the regular 3DS. Hearing about the New 3DS, it was decided to use its increased processing power to realize the game's ambition.<ref name=\"XenoGamespot\" /> Its increased power made the port possible, and its button layout, with the inclusion of the ZL and ZR shoulder buttons and the C-Stick, meant that the original Wii Classic Controller button layout could be used without adjustment. As part of the alterations made to the title, much of the on-screen information was moved down to the bottom Touch screen so as to de-clutter the top screen, while the layout was carefully arranged so as to maintain the feel of the original as much as possible.<ref name=\"Nin3DSinterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/03/interview_nintendos_hiro_yamada_on_the_challenge_of_bringing_xenoblade_chronicles_to_the_new_nintendo_3ds|title=Interview: Nintendo's Hiro Yamada On The Challenge Of Bringing Xenoblade Chronicles To The New Nintendo 3DS|last=Whitehead|first=Thomas|website=Nintendo Life|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111202644/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/03/interview_nintendos_hiro_yamada_on_the_challenge_of_bringing_xenoblade_chronicles_to_the_new_nintendo_3ds|archivedate=11 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo maintain [[frame rate]] and the seamless transitions between environments, unspecified \"technical tricks\" were used.

This entailed the creation of a new graphics engine with a custom visibility culling and complex [[level of detail]] systems.

Initially released in Japan in 2010, it was later released in the PAL region in 2011 and then in North America in 2012. A port for the [[New Nintendo 3DS]] was released in 2015, and a remaster for the [[Nintendo Switch]] is scheduled to be released in 2020. ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' is the first entry in the ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' series, a subseries which forms part of the ''[[Xeno (series)|Xeno]]'' metaseries. Although no direct narrative connections exist to previous ''Xeno'' games, it incorporates aesthetic and narrative elements from both [[Science fantasy|fantasy and science fiction]]. The game features navigation through an [[open world]] split into zones, side-quests tied to party members' affinity, and a real-time action-based battle system which incorporates the main character's ability to see glimpses of the future.\n\n''Xenoblade Chronicles'' takes place on the frozen bodies of two warring titans, the Bionis and the Mechonis. The people of Bionis, including the human-like Homs, are in a [[perpetual war]] with the Mechon machine race of Mechonis. Key to the Homs' efforts in fighting against the Mechon army is the Monado, a sword that is said to have been wielded by the Bionis. During an attack on his colony, the main protagonist [[Shulk]] discovers his ability to wield the Monado and sets out on a quest for revenge with his best friend, Reyn, with others joining in as the game progresses.\n\nThe concept for ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' originated in June 2006 when the game's executive director and lead writer, [[Tetsuya Takahashi]], visualized and then constructed a model of two giant gods frozen in place with people living on their bodies. Development began in 2007 under the title ''Monado: The Beginning of the World'', though it was eventually rebranded with its current title in honor of Takahashi's previous work. The script was worked on by Takahashi, anime writer Yuichiro Takeda, and Nintendo writer Yurie Hattori. The music was handled by six different composers, including first-timer and lead composer Manami Kiyota and industry veterans [[Yoko Shimomura]] and [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], with the latter writing the ending theme.\n\nThe game was announced in 2009 under its original title and released in Japan the following year. Despite releasing in Europe and in Oceania, its North American release remained unconfirmed until December 2011, during which time a fan campaign called [[Operation Rainfall]] drew considerable attention to the game. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim as one of the best recent role-playing games, while its New Nintendo 3DS port was praised for successfully re-creating the game in portable form. It also met with commercial success in both Japan and the West. A [[spiritual successor]] by the same development team for the [[Wii U]], ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles X]]'', was released in 2015.<!--No exact dates; per WP:VG/DATE--> A sequel for the Nintendo Switch, ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles 2]]'', was released in 2017.<!--No exact dates; per WP:VG/DATE-->\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Xenoblade-Landscape.jpg|thumb|left|Shulk (middle) and Reyn on the Bionis' Leg.

Combat is won when all enemies lose their HP, but the game is lost if the player's character loses all their HP and has no means of being revived. Health may be restored by the player by using healing Arts in battle, or the player may let characters' HP regenerate automatically outside of battle. Winning battles earns the player [[experience points]], which allows the characters to grow stronger by [[leveling up]] and learning new Arts.

They reveal that Zanza resided inside Shulk's body after he was killed during the expedition to claim the Monado, and Dickson has been preparing Shulk to take control of the Monado and eventually awaken Zanza. Egil and Meyneth attempt to fight Zanza, but they are defeated and Meyneth's Monado is stolen. As the party escapes, Egil attempts to fight once more, but Zanza destroys both him and the Mechonis.\n\nAfter the Mechonis' destruction, Zanza transforms the pure-blooded High Entia into Telethia, who purge Bionis of life.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Xenoblade Chronicles|developer=[[Monolith Soft]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=1 September 2011|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=|level=|quote='''Dickson''': It's just like she says.

However, the High Entia Minister of Research Lorithia is revealed to be Zanza's disciple, and releases ether to transform the High Entia squadron into Telethia. While the party grieves for Shulk, Shulk awakens thanks to Alvis and manages to defeat a Telethia raid on Colony 6, but Alvis is revealed to be the third disciple of Zanza, though Shulk suspects an ulterior motive. Making their way to Prison Island, they defeat Lorithia and Dickson. The party then travels to face Zanza, who declares the life of Bionis as simply his food and vessels, and with both Monados, he intends to recreate the world as he has before, destroying the current world and both everyone and everything in it in the process.

Klaus's obsessive desires caused the experiment to end in disaster, obliterating the universe and causing Zanza and Meyneth to be reborn as gods.

Takahashi had previously worked in the 1990s on ''[[Xenogears]]'', then on the ''[[Xenosaga]]'' trilogy after founding Monolith Soft in 1999. ''Xenosaga'' was intended to be a six-part series, but low commercial performances forced the planned ''Xenosaga'' series to be halved.<ref name=\"USGxeno\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/how-the-xenoverse-got-its-groove-back|title=How the Xenoverse Got Its Groove Back|last=Mackey|first=Bob|website=[[Eurogamer|USGamer]]|date=10 April 2015|accessdate=9 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907022259/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/how-the-xenoverse-got-its-groove-back|archivedate=7 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> After these events, the entire development team was in a state of low morale.<ref name=\"NinXen3DS\"/> The initial concept for ''Xenoblade Chronicles'', of people living on the bodies of gigantic gods, came to Takahashi in June 2006. Struck by his idea, he immediately committed it to paper and showed the draft to other senior staff, who were favorably impressed. One of them, an executive called [[Yasuyuki Honne]], thought it would make a good 3D model and bought materials to create it. Construction began in July: during this period, younger staff acted as [[Model (art)|models]] so that Takahashi could establish which parts of the gods' bodies could be used as habitable and navigable environments in various poses.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiDev\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Xenoblade-Chronicles/Vol-3-The-Development-Process/1-Seeing-it-Through-to-the-End/1-Seeing-it-Through-to-the-End-839492.html|title=Iwata Asks: Xenoblade Chronicles for Wii - Vol 3: The Development Process|publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo UK]]|date=2011|accessdate=8 December 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ddJJGzDV?url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Xenoblade-Chronicles/Vol-3-The-Development-Process/1-Seeing-it-Through-to-the-End/1-Seeing-it-Through-to-the-End-839492.html|archivedate=8 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Xenoblade-Chronicles/Vol-2-Story/1-Playing-a-Game-of-Catch/1-Playing-a-Game-of-Catch-206701.html|title=Iwata Asks: Xenoblade Chronicles for Wii - Vol 2: Story|publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo UK]]|date=2011|accessdate=8 December 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ddIpjO0R?url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Xenoblade-Chronicles/Vol-2-Story/1-Playing-a-Game-of-Catch/1-Playing-a-Game-of-Catch-206701.html|archivedate=8 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAfter the model's construction, Takahashi decided to combine the model's concept with an unrelated story idea, which became the basis for a new game after positive feedback from staff.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiDev\"/><ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> Takahashi later said that one of the main reasons for developing the game was to bolster team morale after the commercial failure of the ''Xenosaga'' games.<ref name=\"NinXen3DS\"/> The team first showed their proposal to Nintendo prior to the final development stages of ''[[Disaster: Day of Crisis]]''.

Takahashi was responsible for creating the main concept, but as he was going to be director and executive producer, he was unable to also take on full script-writing duties, so he asked Takeda to be his partner in creating the scenario. Takeda was a writer for anime who had previously collaborated with Takahashi on adaptations of the [[Xenosaga Episode I|first ''Xenosaga'' game]], in addition to writing the script for ''[[Xenosaga I & II]]'', the [[Nintendo DS]] remake of ''Xenosaga'' and [[Xenosaga Episode II|its sequel]]. Takahashi deliberately chose someone outside the video game industry as he wanted a different perspective on the story's pacing.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> Hattori was brought in during the early development stages due to her experience with scenarios for Nintendo games, which enabled her to look at Takahashi and Takeda's scenario from an objective viewpoint.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiDev\"/> A key element in the scenario was contrasting senses of scale, which Takahashi described as \"contrasting the realms of the micro and the macro\", while the main story themes were characters embarking on a great and evolving journey, and overcoming a predetermined future.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/><ref name=\"GI3dInterview\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/15/interview-inside-the-development-of-xenoblade-chronicles-3ds.aspx|title=Interview: Inside The Development Of Xenoblade Chronicles 3DS|last1=Helgeson|first1=Matt|last2=Wallace|first2=Kimberley|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|date=15 April 2015|accessdate=15 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020200105/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/15/interview-inside-the-development-of-xenoblade-chronicles-3ds.aspx|archivedate=20 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite multiple fantasy elements, ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' is based within a science fiction premise, although such elements were kept low-key during the first part of the game.<ref name=\"NinXen3DS\"/><ref>{{cite book|date=24 July 2010|script-title=ja:\u30bc\u30ce\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u3000\u30b6\u30fb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9|trans-title=Xenoblade: The Complete Guide|publisher=[[ASCII Media Works]]|page=285|isbn = 978-4-04-868841-3}}</ref>\n\nDespite their earlier work together, it was the first time Takahashi and Takeda were so intimately involved in a project. Takeda found working on the project more difficult than he initially anticipated: his standard writing form was for the anime series format, which was limited to 20-25 minute episodes. With ''Xenoblade Chronicles'', the volume of story and writing work was much larger and offered more freedom for dramatic expression. Conversely, his previous experience enabled Takahashi to easily plan the structure and scheduling for the game. During the initial writing stages, Takahashi did not give precise instructions to Takeda: he instead gave a rough outline that they worked on together, then they passed the developing script between themselves, along with producers Shingo Kawabata and Koh Kojima, to iron out rough elements. Takahashi compared it to playing a game of catch, something he was unused to doing for his game scenarios.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> The ending underwent revisions: while Takahashi and Takeda felt they had created a fairly explanatory ending, Hattori still felt unsatisfied. After a second look, Takahashi and Takeda realized that it would appear perplexing for someone outside the writing process, so they rewrote it to be more player-friendly.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiDev\"/> The final script contained a large amount of dialogue: the sheer volume, which included dialogue spoken in battle, made for a difficult experience while recording. Due to all the effort, Takahashi was emphatic that as much of it as possible be used, although he sometimes felt that there was too much. In the end, some dialogue needed to be cut as testers felt that the characters talked too much.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> Takahashi's overall writing style was made deliberately more mature and subdued than other games within the genre.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/06/five-questions-with-xenoblade-chronicles-39-executive-director.aspx|title=Five Questions With Xenoblade Chronicles' Executive Director|last1=Juba|first1=Joe|last2=Kollar|first2=Phil|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=15 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215853/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/06/five-questions-with-xenoblade-chronicles-39-executive-director.aspx|archivedate=4 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOne of the elements that was of great concern to both Takahashi and Takeda was the main protagonist Shulk. Takahashi had noticed that, in the majority of RPGs, the main protagonist was all too easily disliked even if other characters became fan favorites. Consequently, one of the main priorities was to make Shulk as appealing as possible to players. During this process, it was suggested that Shulk be a [[silent protagonist]], but there was a general wish from the staff for him to speak. In addition to this, Takahashi needed to confront the problem faced in any RPG with voiced characters, which was developing them suitably and writing appropriate dialogue between them. The companion character Riki was cited by Takeda as a favorite of his: on paper Riki sounded an unlikable character, but his voice and appearance acted as a counterbalance to his remarks.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> One of the scenes where Hattori had input was a scene between Shulk and Fiora which showcased their connection: the original scene had Shulk touching Fiora's cheek, which Harrori felt would look \"creepy\" coming out of the blue. The scene was altered so Shulk touched her hand instead.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiDev\"/> One of the early concepts Takeda suggested was that one of the main protagonist's party would betray them and become the final boss, but Takahashi rejected this idea as he felt it would run counter to player expectation.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiStory\"/> During the course of its development, the story underwent so many revisions that Takahashi forgot what his original concept was, although the basic framework remained intact throughout.<ref name=\"SilDevelopment\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe original score for ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' was composed by Manami Kiyota, ACE+ (a musical production group composed of Tomori Kudo, Hiroyo \"CHiCO\" Yamanaka, and Kenji Hiramatsu), and [[Yoko Shimomura]].<ref name=\"XenoLiners\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/xenobladesliners/|title=Xenoblade Chronicles Original Soundtrack Liner Notes|publisher=Video Game Music Online|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=12 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604225053/http://www.vgmonline.net/xenobladesliners/|archivedate=4 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"1UPmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/xenoblade-music-dissected|title=Xenoblade's Music Dissected|last=Gifford|first=Kevin|website=[[1UP.com]]|date=12 May 2010|accessdate=12 September 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6de7p1XO1?url=http://www.1up.com/news/xenoblade-music-dissected|archivedate=9 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> As with other parts of development, Takahashi was deeply involved, constantly rejecting pieces due to what he felt was not fitting for the game. He admitted that this was due to early samples he had given the team for his vision for the music, which they had followed too faithfully for his liking.

ACE+ was recommended to Takahashi by Dog Ear Records. Kiyota handled environmental tracks, while ACE+ was in charge of battle tracks in addition to other musical pieces. The team's main goal was to create music that went beyond the typical sound of RPGs. In hindsight, Yamanaka attributed the harmony of the six composers' works to Takahashi's organization and overall direction.<ref name=\"NinXenWiiMusic\"/> The final score contained around ninety tracks. One of the hardest tracks for Shimomura was a nine-minute track that Takahashi requested to match with a movie scene. Later, he said the track needed to change midway through, essentially necessitating the creation of two conjoined themes.<ref name=\"1UPmusic\"/> The majority of the game's music was written by Kiyota and ACE+, with Shimomura writing eleven tracks.

They were requested for the job by Nintendo as the staff at Monolith Soft were already working on the next ''Xenoblade'' title.<ref name=\"NinXen3DS\"/><ref name=\"XenoGamespot\"/> Development on the port started between Autumn and Winter 2013 initially for the original [[Nintendo 3DS]], but initial testing showed that the original platform lacked the memory and power to effectively run the game, since the Wii's processing capabilities were greater than the regular 3DS. Hearing about the New 3DS, it was decided to use its increased processing power to realize the game's ambition.<ref name=\"XenoGamespot\" /> Its increased power made the port possible, and its button layout, with the inclusion of the ZL and ZR shoulder buttons and the C-Stick, meant that the original Wii Classic Controller button layout could be used without adjustment. As part of the alterations made to the title, much of the on-screen information was moved down to the bottom Touch screen so as to de-clutter the top screen, while the layout was carefully arranged so as to maintain the feel of the original as much as possible.<ref name=\"Nin3DSinterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/03/interview_nintendos_hiro_yamada_on_the_challenge_of_bringing_xenoblade_chronicles_to_the_new_nintendo_3ds|title=Interview: Nintendo's Hiro Yamada On The Challenge Of Bringing Xenoblade Chronicles To The New Nintendo 3DS|last=Whitehead|first=Thomas|website=Nintendo Life|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111202644/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/03/interview_nintendos_hiro_yamada_on_the_challenge_of_bringing_xenoblade_chronicles_to_the_new_nintendo_3ds|archivedate=11 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo maintain [[frame rate]] and the seamless transitions between environments, unspecified \"technical tricks\" were used.

This entailed the creation of a new graphics engine with a custom visibility culling and complex [[level of detail]] systems. All of the environments were rebuilt and optimized for the new system while keeping the original aesthetic intact.<ref name=\"GI3dInterview\"/> The reason given for porting the game to the New 3DS rather than the Wii U home console was that the length of the game could be intimidating for the modern gamer, who was becoming more used to on-the-go, quick gaming sessions.\n\n===''Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition''===\nA high-definition remaster, ''Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition'', was announced in September 2019 during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-is-getting-a-xenoblade-chronicles-/1100-6469644/ |title=Nintendo Switch Is Getting A Xenoblade Chronicles Remaster |first=Matt |last=Espineli |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=5 September 2019 |accessdate=7 September 2019}}</ref> In addition to enhanced visuals, updated controls, remixed music, and other quality-of-life improvements, ''Definitive Edition'' also includes a new [[epilogue]] titled ''Future Connected''.

During the [[Spring and Autumn period]], Zhoushan was called Yongdong, referring to its location east of the [[Yong River]]. At the time, it belonged to the [[ancient Chinese states|state]] of [[Yue (state)|Yue]]. The fishermen and sailors who inhabited the islands often engaged in piracy and became recruits for uprisings against the central authorities. At the time of the [[Eastern Jin dynasty|Eastern Jin]], the Zhoushan Islands served as the base for [[Sun En]]'s rebellion. Sun En, an adherent of the [[Taoism in China|Taoist]] sect the [[Way of the Five Pecks of Rice]], launched his rebellion around the year 400 and was defeated by Jin forces in 402.<ref>Gernet 2002, pp. 182\u2013183.</ref> Today's Zhoushan was first created as {{nowrap|Wengshan [[county (China)|County]]}} in [[Ming Prefecture (Zhejiang)|Ming Prefecture]] in 738 under the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]].\n\nIn 863, the Japanese [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk Egaku ({{lang|ja|\u6167\u9537}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinesestudies.hawaii.edu/community/faculty/mccraw/lingjing.pdf |title=Magic Precincts: Five Buddhist temples and How They Grew |author=David McCraw |year=2003 |publisher=Center for Chinese Studies, [[University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918002453/http://www.chinesestudies.hawaii.edu/community/faculty/mccraw/lingjing.pdf |archivedate=18 September 2009 }}</ref> and a [[Putuoshan]] local Zhang-shi ({{lang|zh|\u5f20\u6c0f}}) placed a statue of [[Guanyin]] at Chaoyin Cave ({{lang|zh|\u6f6e\u97f3\u6d1e}}) that would later become a popular tourist and pilgrim destination. In 1073, under the [[Song dynasty|Song]], it was renamed {{nowrap|Changguo County}}; this was upgraded to a [[zhou (administrative division)|prefecture]] in the early [[Yuan dynasty]].During the [[Ming dynasty]], especially between the years 1530 and 1560, Japanese and Chinese pirates used Zhoushan as one of their principal bases from which they launched attacks as far as [[Nanjing]]; \"the whole Chinese coast from northern [[Shandong]] to western [[Guangdong]] was ravaged to a distance of sixty miles inland.\"<ref>Gernet 2002, p. 422.</ref>\n\nAfter suppression of the pirates, Zhoushan became an important commercial entrep\u00f4t.

The restriction of all European trade to the port of Guangzhou in 1760 forced Westerners to leave Zhoushan.

[[Sun Yat-sen]] visited Zhoushan on 25 August 1916 and wrote ''Travelling to Putuo'' ({{lang|zh|\u6e38\u666e\u9640\u5fd7\u5947}}, ''You Putuo Zhiqi''). On 1 October 1942, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese ship]] ''[[Lisbon Maru]]'' was transporting 1,800 [[POW]]s to [[Tokyo]] when she was attacked by the [[USS Grouper|USS{{nbsp}}''Grouper'']] off [[Qingbing Island|Qingbing]] ({{lang|zh|\u9752\u6d5c}}) or [[Dongfushan|Dongfu]]; one torpedo hit and she sank the next day. The fishermen of nearby Dongji ({{lang|zh|\u4e1c\u6781\u4e61}}) rescued 384 of the British prisoners from the wreckage. Amid the [[Chinese Civil War]], Dinghai County lost Shengsi, which became an Archipelago Directly-controlled District ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5217\u5cf6\u76f4\u5c6c\u5340}}) of [[Jiangsu]] in 1946, then a separate county in October 1949. The same year, Dinghai County was divided into [[Dinghai District|Dinghai]] and [[Wengzhou County|Wengzhou]] ({{lang|zh|\u7fc1\u6d32}}) Counties. In November, the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] [[Battle of Dengbu Island|landed on Dengbu Island]], but were repulsed by the defenders.\n\nNevertheless, Zhoushan was overrun by the Communists on 17 May 1950. Wengzhou was merged back into Dinghai County, which made up part of Ningbo Prefecture, and Shengsi made up a special area ({{lang|zh|\u7279\u533a}}) and then county of the [[Songjiang District|Songjiang]] Prefecture, then still part of Jiangsu. In March 1953, the Council of Ministers opted to establish the Zhoushan Prefecture, returning Shengsi and dividing Dinghai into [[Dinghai District|Dinghai]], [[Putuo District, Zhoushan|Putuo]], and [[Daishan]]. Ningbo's [[Xiangshan County, Zhejiang|Xiangshan County]] was also briefly incorporated into this new prefecture from 1954 to 1958. From 1958 to May 1962, Zhoushan was incorporated into Ningbo before becoming a separate prefecture again. Shengsi was temporarily assigned to [[Shanghai]] in the early 1960s. The short-lived Daqu County ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u8862\u7e23}}) was created in 1962 before being redivided between Daishan and Shengsi four years later.\n\nZhoushan was promoted to a [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level \"city\"]] on 27 January 1987, with Dinghai and Putuo Counties upgraded to districts. The municipal People's Government was established on 8 March of that year. April of the same year, the ports of Zhoushan became open to foreign ships. On 10 April 1988, it became a coastal economic open zone.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nZhoushan administers two [[District of China|districts]] and two [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]]. The city currently consists of 36 township-level divisions, including 17 [[town of China|towns]], 5 [[Township (People's Republic of China)|townships]] and 14 [[subdistrict]]s.

These five bridges are Cengang Bridge (\u5c91\u6e2f\u5927\u6865), Xiangjiaomen Bridge (\u54cd\u7901\u95e8\u5927\u6865), [[Taoyaomen Bridge]] (\u6843\u592d\u95e8\u5927\u6865), [[Xihoumen Bridge]] (\u897f\u5820\u95e8\u5927\u6865) and [[Jintang Bridge]] (\u91d1\u5858\u5927\u6865).

It is also the shortest national level highway that runs in the east\u2013west direction. Before reaching Zhoushan, Highway 329 passes through municipalities of [[Shaoxing]] and [[Ningbo]]. The route between the boundaries of Ningbo and Zhoushan is built in the form of [[ferry]], which is also unique in the national highway system. The ferry dock on Ningbo's side is named Baifeng, and the one on Zhoushan's side is named Yadanshan. The route of Highway 329 in Zhoushan has undergone several changes and adjustments. Initially the route went through the southern shoreline of Zhoushan Island and ended in Shenjiamen. However, with the construction of Zhujiajian Bridge, the route was extended all the way to Nansha Beach of Zhujiajian Island. Later, with the development Dinghai and Lincheng, part of Highway 329 was designated as urban roads instead of a rapid passing corridor. Therefore, Highway 329 went on to take the route of the outer ring road of Dinghai and Highway Baiquan-Shenjiamen. Recently to optimize the highway structure of Zhoushan, Highway 329 is undergoing another large modification in its route. The new route, designed with a series of tunnels and interchanges, will run at the center of Zhoushan Island to form its backbone. Seven tunnels on the new route account for a length of 11,187 meters. A total of 5 interchanges are designed along the new route. The project, projected to spend 5 billion yuan, is set to finish in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|author=document.write(getNowDate()) |url=http://www.zhoushan.cn/newscenter/zsxw/201212/t20121228_575341.htm |title=\u821f\u5c71\u7f51\u00b7\u5927\u6d77\u7f51:\u5e26\u4f60\u8ba4\u8bc6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u56fd\u9053 |publisher=Zhoushan.cn |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}</ref>\n* Zhoushan [[Bus Rapid Transit]] (\u821f\u5c71\u5feb\u901f\u516c\u4ea4\uff09is the rapid transit system with dedicated lanes between urban agglomerations on Zhoushan Island.

Dongsha Ancient Town was once the county seat of Daishan, that is famous for hundreds years of commercial and exchange activities associated to traditional fishing industry. Several major buildings and facilities have been well protected. Shuanghe features wonderful large-scale man-made cliffs and precipices which are the result of hundreds years of carving for granite materials for architectural purposes. Daishan has the reputation of being a county of museums. Its collection of museums include themes such as fishing culture, Zhoushan dialect, typhoon, lighthouse, salt production, etc. Besides the above-stated attractions on Daishan Island, other islands are noteworthy as well. For example, Xiushan Island features the only inter-tidal mud theme park in China. Qushan Island features Mount Guanyin, which is also a bodhimanda of Guanyin.

During the [[Spring and Autumn period]], Zhoushan was called '''Yongdong''', referring to its location east of the [[Yong River]]. At the time, it belonged to the [[ancient Chinese states|state]] of [[Yue (state)|Yue]]. The fishermen and sailors who inhabited the islands often engaged in piracy and became recruits for uprisings against the central authorities. At the time of the [[Eastern Jin dynasty|Eastern Jin]], the Zhoushan Islands served as the base for [[Sun En]]'s rebellion. Sun En, an adherent of the [[Taoism in China|Taoist]] sect the [[Way of the Five Pecks of Rice]], launched his rebellion around the year 400 and was defeated by Jin forces in 402.<ref>Gernet 2002, pp. 182\u2013183.</ref> Today's Zhoushan was first created as {{nowrap|'''Wengshan [[county (China)|County]]'''}} in [[Ming Prefecture (Zhejiang)|Ming Prefecture]] in 738 under the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]].\n\nIn 863, the Japanese [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk Egaku ({{lang|ja|\u6167\u9537}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinesestudies.hawaii.edu/community/faculty/mccraw/lingjing.pdf |title=Magic Precincts: Five Buddhist temples and How They Grew |author=David McCraw |year=2003 |publisher=Center for Chinese Studies, [[University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918002453/http://www.chinesestudies.hawaii.edu/community/faculty/mccraw/lingjing.pdf |archivedate=18 September 2009 }}</ref> and a [[Putuoshan]] local Zhang-shi ({{lang|zh|\u5f20\u6c0f}}) placed a statue of [[Guanyin]] at Chaoyin Cave ({{lang|zh|\u6f6e\u97f3\u6d1e}}) that would later become a popular tourist and pilgrim destination. In 1073, under the [[Song dynasty|Song]], it was renamed {{nowrap|'''Changguo County'''}}; this was upgraded to a [[zhou (administrative division)|prefecture]] in the early [[Yuan dynasty]].During the [[Ming dynasty]], especially between the years 1530 and 1560, Japanese and Chinese pirates used Zhoushan as one of their principal bases from which they launched attacks as far as [[Nanjing]]; \"the whole Chinese coast from northern [[Shandong]] to western [[Guangdong]] was ravaged to a distance of sixty miles inland.\"<ref>Gernet 2002, p. 422.</ref>\n\nAfter suppression of the pirates, Zhoushan became an important commercial entrep\u00f4t.

The restriction of all European trade to the port of Guangzhou in 1760 forced Westerners to leave Zhoushan. One of the requests of [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]]'s embassy to the [[Qianlong Emperor]] in 1793 was an acquisition of \"a small unfortified island near Zhoushan for the residence of English traders, storage of goods, and outfitting of ships.\" The Qianlong Emperor denied this request together with all the rest.<ref>See \"Ch'ien lung's Letter to George III,\" http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~jobrien/reference/ob41.html.{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nBritish forces under Captain [[Charles Elliot]] [[Capture of Chusan|captured Zhoushan]] on 5\u20136 July 1840 during the [[First Opium War]] and evacuated it in early 1841, after Elliot reached an agreement with [[Qishan (official)|Qishan]], the [[Viceroys in China|Governor-General]] of [[Tianjin]] and Grand Secretary to the [[Daoguang Emperor]], in exchange for cession of [[Hong Kong]].<ref>Spence 1991, p. 156.</ref> At that time, Zhoushan was a well known port while Hong Kong was still only a fishing village.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The British Foreign Secretary [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]] was famously livid when he learned that Elliot agreed to the cession of Hong Kong (\"a barren island with hardly a house on it\"){{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} while giving up Zhoushan.

[[Sun Yat-sen]] visited Zhoushan on 25 August 1916 and wrote ''Travelling to Putuo'' ({{lang|zh|\u6e38\u666e\u9640\u5fd7\u5947}}, ''You Putuo Zhiqi''). On 1 October 1942, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese ship]] ''[[Lisbon Maru]]'' was transporting 1,800 [[POW]]s to [[Tokyo]] when she was attacked by the [[USS Grouper|USS{{nbsp}}''Grouper'']] off [[Qingbing Island|Qingbing]] ({{lang|zh|\u9752\u6d5c}}) or [[Dongfushan|Dongfu]]; one torpedo hit and she sank the next day. The fishermen of nearby Dongji ({{lang|zh|\u4e1c\u6781\u4e61}}) rescued 384 of the British prisoners from the wreckage. Amid the [[Chinese Civil War]], Dinghai County lost Shengsi, which became an Archipelago Directly-controlled District ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5217\u5cf6\u76f4\u5c6c\u5340}}) of [[Jiangsu]] in 1946, then a separate county in October 1949. The same year, Dinghai County was divided into [[Dinghai District|Dinghai]] and [[Wengzhou County|Wengzhou]] ({{lang|zh|\u7fc1\u6d32}}) Counties. In November, the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] [[Battle of Dengbu Island|landed on Dengbu Island]], but were repulsed by the defenders.\n\nNevertheless, Zhoushan was overrun by the Communists on 17 May 1950. Wengzhou was merged back into Dinghai County, which made up part of Ningbo Prefecture, and Shengsi made up a special area ({{lang|zh|\u7279\u533a}}) and then county of the [[Songjiang District|Songjiang]] Prefecture, then still part of Jiangsu. In March 1953, the Council of Ministers opted to establish the Zhoushan Prefecture, returning Shengsi and dividing Dinghai into [[Dinghai District|Dinghai]], [[Putuo District, Zhoushan|Putuo]], and [[Daishan]]. Ningbo's [[Xiangshan County, Zhejiang|Xiangshan County]] was also briefly incorporated into this new prefecture from 1954 to 1958. From 1958 to May 1962, Zhoushan was incorporated into Ningbo before becoming a separate prefecture again. Shengsi was temporarily assigned to [[Shanghai]] in the early 1960s. The short-lived Daqu County ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u8862\u7e23}}) was created in 1962 before being redivided between Daishan and Shengsi four years later.\n\nZhoushan was promoted to a [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level \"city\"]] on 27 January 1987, with Dinghai and Putuo Counties upgraded to districts. The municipal People's Government was established on 8 March of that year. April of the same year, the ports of Zhoushan became open to foreign ships. On 10 April 1988, it became a coastal economic open zone.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nZhoushan administers two [[District of China|districts]] and two [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]]. The city currently consists of 36 township-level divisions, including 17 [[town of China|towns]], 5 [[Township (People's Republic of China)|townships]] and 14 [[subdistrict]]s.

It is also the shortest national level highway that runs in the east\u2013west direction. Before reaching Zhoushan, Highway 329 passes through municipalities of [[Shaoxing]] and [[Ningbo]]. The route between the boundaries of Ningbo and Zhoushan is built in the form of [[ferry]], which is also unique in the national highway system. The ferry dock on Ningbo's side is named Baifeng, and the one on Zhoushan's side is named Yadanshan. The route of Highway 329 in Zhoushan has undergone several changes and adjustments. Initially the route went through the southern shoreline of Zhoushan Island and ended in Shenjiamen. However, with the construction of Zhujiajian Bridge, the route was extended all the way to Nansha Beach of Zhujiajian Island. Later, with the development Dinghai and Lincheng, part of Highway 329 was designated as urban roads instead of a rapid passing corridor. Therefore, Highway 329 went on to take the route of the outer ring road of Dinghai and Highway Baiquan-Shenjiamen. Recently to optimize the highway structure of Zhoushan, Highway 329 is undergoing another large modification in its route. The new route, designed with a series of tunnels and interchanges, will run at the center of Zhoushan Island to form its backbone. Seven tunnels on the new route account for a length of 11,187 meters. A total of 5 interchanges are designed along the new route. The project, projected to spend 5 billion yuan, is set to finish in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|author=document.write(getNowDate()) |url=http://www.zhoushan.cn/newscenter/zsxw/201212/t20121228_575341.htm |title=\u821f\u5c71\u7f51\u00b7\u5927\u6d77\u7f51:\u5e26\u4f60\u8ba4\u8bc6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u56fd\u9053 |publisher=Zhoushan.cn |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}</ref>\n* Zhoushan [[Bus Rapid Transit]] (\u821f\u5c71\u5feb\u901f\u516c\u4ea4\uff09is the rapid transit system with dedicated lanes between urban agglomerations on Zhoushan Island.

Besides, there are scheduled ships travelling between Zhoushan and other ports, such as [[Wenzhou]] and [[Fuzhou]]. Major inhabited islands within the municipality are served by smaller scale ferries and speedboat fleets. Frequencies depend on levels of population.\n\n== Energy ==\nThere exist 2 power connections: [[HVDC Zhoushan]], the first HVDC built in China and [[Zhoushan Island Overhead Powerline Tie]] with the tallest electricity pylons in the world, as well as the world's [[List of spans|longest span]].\n\n==Tourism==\n\nZhoushan, which proudly boasts two national level key scenic areas (Mount Putuo and Shengsi Islands) and two provincial level key scenic areas (Taohua Island and Daishan), is always praised to be the \"backyard garden\" of [[Yangtze River Delta]]. Beside these scenic areas, Zhoushan has an abundance of points of interest, landscape forms and tourism resources, many of which are still under development, due to its rich historic and natural endowment. Conveniently connected to the continental part of the delta, Zhoushan attracted 27.71 million visitors (which is approximately 25 times its population), 310.5 thousand of whom were from abroad, in 2012 alone. Tourism and its related services have risen to be a very important sector of the municipal economy with a total tourism revenue of 26.68 billion yuan, according to the 2012 statistic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats-sh.gov.cn/fxbg/201304/255182.html |title=\u821f\u5c71\u5e022012\u5e74\u56fd\u6c11\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u53d1\u5c55\u7edf\u8ba1\u516c\u62a5 |publisher=Stats-sh.gov.cn |date=2013-04-11 |accessdate=2015-12-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062211/http://www.stats-sh.gov.cn/fxbg/201304/255182.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Mount Putuo National Scenic Area===\n\n[[File:Fayu Temple of Mt.

The scenic area, with a total area of 41.85 square kilometers, is the only place in China where combines the mountain and sea views, and religious culture perfectly.\n\nOn a visit in the early 1830s, missionary [[Karl G\u00fctzlaff]] noted that the island of \"Poo-to\" boasted two large and 60 small temples, attended by 2,000 monks,\n\n<blockquote>To every person who visits this island, it appears at first like a fairy land, so romantic is everything which meets the eye.  Those large inscriptions hewn in solid granite, the many temples which appear in every direction, the highly picturesque scenery itself, with its many-peaked, riven, and detached rocks, and above all a stately mausoleum, the largest which I have ever seen, containing the bones and ashes of thousands of priests, quite bewilder the imagination.<ref>{{cite book|last=G\u00fctzlaff|first=Karl Friedrich A|title=Journal of Three Voyages Along the Coast of China, in 1831, 1832 and 1833 With Notices of Siam, Corea, and the Loo-Choo Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQEUAAAAQAAJ|year=1840|page=444}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Mount Putuo]] ({{lang|zh|\u666e\u9640\u5c71}}), also named Mount Meicen ({{lang|zh|\u6885\u5c91\u5c71}}) and Mount Baihua ({{lang|zh-hans|\u767d\u534e\u5c71}}), is considered the [[bodhimanda]] of [[Avalokitesvara]] ([[Guan Yin|Guanyin]]), a revered Bodhisattva in many parts of East Asia. It is one of the four sacred mountains in [[Chinese Buddhism]], the others being [[Mount Wutai]], [[Mount Jiuhua]], and [[Mount Emei]]. However, different from other three sacred mountains which are mountains with heights of more than 1,000 meters, Mount Putuo is actually a small island with a total area of {{convert|12.5|km2|abbr=on}}, the highest point of which is Peak Foding ({{convert|291.3|m|disp=or|abbr=on}} above the sea level). Mount Putuo features three grand temples (Puji Temple, Fayu Temple, and Huiji Temple), three treasures (Tahoto Pagoda, Yangzhi Guanyin Stele, and Nine-Dragon Caisson), three rocks (Rock Pantuo, Heart Rock, and Rock Ergui Tingfa), three caves (Cave Chaoyang, Cave Chaoyin and Cave Fanyin), 88 nunneries and 128 huts, and twelve scenes. Mount Putuo was praised in various historic records. It is often titled as Bulguksa Among Seas and Skies ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6d77\u5929\u4f5b\u56fd}}), or Sacred Ground on the Southern Seas ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5357\u6d77\u5723\u5883}}\uff09. Mount Putuo is always mentioned in the same breath with the [[West Lake]] in [[Hangzhou]], another national scenic area of Zhejiang. West Lake is considered to be the foremost place that combines mountain and lake views, whereas Mount Putuo is deemed as the top place where integrates mountain and sea views ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4ee5\u5c71\u800c\u517c\u6e56\u4e4b\u80dc\uff0c\u5219\u63a8\u897f\u6e56\uff1b\u4ee5\u5c71\u800c\u517c\u6d77\u4e4b\u80dc\uff0c\u5f53\u63a8\u666e\u9640}}).\n\n[[File:Daqingshan scenic spot in Zhujiajian.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Daqingshan scenic spot in Zhujiajian]]\nZhujiajian ({{lang|zh|\u6731\u5bb6\u5c16}}) is the fifth largest island of the archipelago and a newly developed seaside resort with intriguing seascapes, unmarred beaches, dense woods, sheer rock cliffs, hills for hiking, extraordinary seafood and displays of fishermen folk culture.

It is also an ideal place for extreme sports, such as car racing, mountain cycling, gliding, rock climbing and bungee jumping. Baishan Mountain features huge natural rocks of different shapes, Guanyin carving on the cliff, and the Putuo Impression show, directed by Zhang Yimou. Zhujiajian is also the site for Mount Putuo Buddhist Academy. Wushitang (Dark Stone Beach) is the 500-meter beach consisting of numerous dark colored pebbles.\n\n===Shengsi Islands National Scenic Area===\n\n[[Shengsi Islands]] National Scenic Area ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5d4a\u6cd7\u5217\u5c9b\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ea7\u91cd\u70b9\u98ce\u666f\u540d\u80dc\u533a}}) is the only national level scenic area in China that is established on a group of natural islands. The scenic area, consisting of hundreds of islands outlying the [[Hangzhou Bay]], boasts multiple quality beaches, rocks, and cliffs. Although it is commonly endowed with natural seascape beauty, each island is unique. Jihu and Nanchangtu Twin Beaches, the northernmost sand beaches of Southern China (and the natural beaches closest to Shanghai), make Sijiao Island a popular tourism destination. Shengshan is one of the most important fishing ports on the East China Sea. The eastern coast of Shengshan Island features steep cliffs, an ideal place to view sunrise above the sea. On the north coast is the abandoned fishing village of [[Houtouwan]], now overgrown with vegetation. Gouqi Island is famous for its well-preserved fishing villages and cultures, the largest aquatic farm in China and the Mountain and Sea Wonders ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5c71\u6d77\u5947\u89c2}}) rock that was believed to be left by General Hou Jigao of [[Ming Dynasty]], who defended the southeastern coast against the raids from [[wokou]]. Huaniao Island features the Huaniao Lighthouse, initially built in 1870 with the reputation of the first lighthouse of the [[Far East]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u8fdc\u4e1c\u7b2c\u4e00\u706f\u5854}}), that stands on the busiest shipping route in China entering and leaving Shanghai and the [[Yangtze River]].

It is also a popular site for shooting movies and TV series based on Mr. [[Jin Yong]]\u2019s novels. Four Chinese TV serials \u2013 \"The Eagle-Shooting Heroes,\" \"Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils,\" \"The Return of the Condor Heroes\" and \"Duke of Mount Deer\" \u2013 were filmed on the island. Starting from 2004, the Jin Yong Martial Arts (Wuxia) Culture Festival is held here every other year around summer. It offers dazzling martial arts performances and competitions, all thrilling for Cha's fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghaidaily.com/zhoushan/thd.html|title=Taohua (Peach Plossom) Island|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530041155/http://www.shanghaidaily.com/zhoushan/thd.html|archivedate=30 May 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Daishan Provincial Level Scenic Area===\n\nDaishan (\u5cb1\u5c71), originally known as Penglai, is believed to be the reached by [[Xu Fu]] of [[Qin Dynasty]] during his eastward journey to [[Japan]]. Mount Moxin, with a height of 257 meters above the sea level, is the highest peak on [[Daishan Island]], from where visitors can get the fantastic view of Gaoting, the county seat, and nearby islands and water channels. Ciyun Temple is the major temple on Mount Moxin and a popular scenic spot. Lulan-qingsha Beach, measuring a length of 3,600 meters and a width of 500 meters, is the single longest beach of [[Eastern China]]. It is an ideal place for camping, flying kites, and movie-shooting. The beach is also the location for yearly worship services or matsuris of the ocean for fishing harvest. Dongsha Ancient Town was once the county seat of Daishan, that is famous for hundreds years of commercial and exchange activities associated to traditional fishing industry. Several major buildings and facilities have been well protected. Shuanghe features wonderful large-scale man-made cliffs and precipices which are the result of hundreds years of carving for granite materials for architectural purposes. Daishan has the reputation of being a county of museums. Its collection of museums include themes such as fishing culture, Zhoushan dialect, typhoon, lighthouse, salt production, etc. Besides the above-stated attractions on Daishan Island, other islands are noteworthy as well. For example, Xiushan Island features the only inter-tidal mud theme park in China. Qushan Island features Mount Guanyin, which is also a bodhimanda of Guanyin. Changtu is a traditional fishing port, which is famous for its Wojingtan Hard Cake.\n\n==Notable people==\n===Arts===\n\n*He Wei (\u4f55\u7232; 1922-2011), famous writer\n*[[Sanmao (author)|Sanmao]] (\u4e09\u6bdb; 1943\u20131991), famous Taiwanese writer\n*[[Wong Kar-wai]] (\u738b\u5bb6\u885b; born 1958), Hong Kong filmmaker\n*[[Michael Miu]] (\u82d7\u50d1\u5049; born 1958), Hong Kong TVB actor\n*[[Wu Shanzhuan]] (\u5433\u5c71\u5c08; born 1960), artist\n*[[He Saifei]] (\u4f55\u8cfd\u98db; born 1964), actress\n*[[Sandy Lam]]  (\u6797\u61b6\u84ee; born 1966), Hong Kong singer\n\n===Politics===\n\n*[[K.
