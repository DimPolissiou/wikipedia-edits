The first permanent residents arrived in the 13th century.

In the 20th century the population of Kumlinge slowly began to decline.\n\n==Sights==\nThe church in the village is dedicated to [[St. Anne]] and dates from the 15th century. There are two farm museums in Kumlinge: Hermas museig\u00e5rd and Sj\u00f6lunds g\u00e5rdsmuseum. There is also a memorial stone in F\u00e4lberget which is dedicated to the war of 1808 when a Russian [[battalion]] was defeated in the village of Kumlinge. The old post route also goes through Kumlinge.

The first permanent residents arrived in the 13th century.

In the 20th century the population of Kumlinge slowly began to decline.\n\n==Sights==\nThe church in the village is dedicated to [[St. Anne]] and dates from the 15th century. There are two farm museums in Kumlinge: Hermas museig\u00e5rd and Sj\u00f6lunds g\u00e5rdsmuseum. There is also a memorial stone in F\u00e4lberget which is dedicated to the war of 1808 when a Russian [[battalion]] was defeated in the village of Kumlinge.

De Castro's signature line became a [[Magandang Gabi, Bayan|news magazine program]] which hosted by himself on the same name of a signature line. The signature line went popularized until November 19, 2004, the day [[Korina Sanchez]] first left the newscast, and again since November 8, 2010, the day of his reinstatement.\n\nSegment anchors included [[Ernie Baron]], who served as the newscast's chief meteorologist and provided viewers trivia pertaining to science and history, and actress-personality Angelique Lazo (now with [[People's Television Network|PTV]]), who first hosted Star News, an entertainment news segment.<ref name=\"abs-cbnnews.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/current-affairs-programs/03/02/12/tv-patrol-turns-25|title=TV Patrol turns 25|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/04/07/12/star-patrollers-join-dumauals-25th-wedding-anniversary|title=Star Patrollers join Dumauals' 25th wedding anniversary|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>\n\nThe style of the newscast, according to De Castro, was eventually \"Tabloid on the Air\".\nMost of its segments were: \"Wanted\" (later became Pulis Report), & Lingkod Bayan: Ang Puso ng TV Patrol.\n\nHowever, Arevalo eventually left the newscast to host the morning show ''[[Magandang Umaga Po]]'' (previously known as ''Good Morning, Philippines'' and ''Magandang Umaga''). [[Frankie Evangelista]] swapped for him on June 1, 1987. Evangelista would later be notable for his TV Patrol discussion segment entitled ''PULSO: Pangkalahatang Ugnayan Laan Sa Opinyon'' (PULSE: Overall Correlation Reserved for Opinions).\n\nWith the introduction of international broadcasts in 1989 to the Pacific islands of [[Guam]] and [[Saipan]], and later with the birth of [[The Filipino Channel]] in 1994, TV Patrol became the first Philippine newscast and program to be broadcast overseas. It still does so today, now in an expanded reach through TFC and the live web streaming on its official webpage.\n\nIn 1992, both [[Korina Sanchez]] and [[Ted Failon]] temporarily took over Tiangco's and Evangelista's chairs until TV Patrol underwent changes on its theme and title card the same year. [[Christine Bersola-Babao|Christine Bersola]] joined the newscast a year later to host Star News until 1996.\n\nIn 1995, [[Korina Sanchez]], who is from Hoy Gising replaced Tiangco to TV Patrol's anchor when the latter moved to [[GMA Network]] after being suspended from doing a TV commercial. Sanchez's as anchor then who would also be placed in Tiangco's seat. The former continued anchoring Tiangco's ''Lingkod Bayan'', a public service segment of the newscast. [[Ted Failon]] replaced Evangelista in TV Patrol and continued anchoring Evangelista's ''PULSO: Pangkalahatang Ugnayan Laan Sa Opinyon'' (PULSE: Overall Correlation Reserved for Opinions).\n\nIn 1996, the broadcast had begun to cut its airing time to 30 minutes when [[Noli de Castro]] became the sole anchor of the newscast with [[Henry Omaga-Diaz]] as his substitute anchor. The newscast was reformatted with a brand new logo (constant version changes) and theme music. This style became identical to the American television network news programs [[ABC World News Tonight]], [[CBS Evening News]] and [[NBC Nightly News]]. [[Marc Logan (broadcast journalist)|Marc Logan]] was hired to become the news reader of trivial segments and features. On January 4, 1999, the newscast returned its airtime to one hour. On February 14, 2000, TV Patrol started its simulcast over AM radio stations [[DZMM-AM|DZMM]] (Manila), [[DYAB-AM|DYAB]] (Cebu), and [[DXAB]] (Davao) and began its online presence through the ABS-CBN News website. On February 23, 2001, De Castro left the newscast to [[2001 Philippine general election|run]] for [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]].

During that time, Sanchez was situated on news studio, while Bendijo anchored outside the studio.\n\nOn April 21, 2003, TV Patrol relaunched its studio set, newsdesk and graphics, along with the theme music & a silhouetted OBB.

The September 24, 2003 edition, which featured Kris' interview, ate up most of the newscast's airtime, making it extend beyond its 6:30\u20138:00pm time slot. According to AGB, the edition, the longest in its history back then, garnered a rating of 47.2% in [[Mega Manila]].<ref>{{Cite news| title=GMA-7 not bothered by ABS-CBN ratings surge | date=September 28, 2003 | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer | url=http://www.inq7.net/ent/2003/sep/28/ent_2-1.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Julius Babao later joined the news studio, which would expand the set with a video wall. Aside from its reformat, TV Patrol launches its new slogan \"Subok nang Maasahan\" based on ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs 2004 slogan.\n\nIn September 2004, the ratings of TV Patrol started to decline, since it faced with rival [[GMA Network]]'s new early evening newscast [[24 Oras]]. Thus, the ABS-CBN management needed to relaunch TV Patrol before the year ends. [[Korina Sanchez]] left the newscast on November 19, 2004, in line with the network's effort to regain top slot in the ratings and to make way for the relaunch of the newscast as TV Patrol World.<ref name=\"TVPatrolWorld\"/>\n\n===2004\u20132010: TV Patrol World===\nOn November 22, 2004, TV Patrol relaunched as TV Patrol World to give weight to reports from Filipino communities worldwide. [[Julius Babao]] was joined by [[Ted Failon]] and [[Karen Davila]] as its main anchors, while special segments are anchored by [[Ernie Baron]], [[Phoemela Baranda]], and [[Bernadette Sembrano]], Davila's colleague from [[GMA Network]]. The name \"World\" became related to [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]]'s former [[English language]] late-night newscast [[The World Tonight (Philippine newscast)|The World Tonight]] which was later transferred to [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] in 1999 and it airs until this day. For the first time, the newscast used a full stand-up delivery. Ernie Baron died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on January 23, 2006 and months later, he was replaced by [[Kim Atienza]] as the newscast's resident weatherman.\n\nOn April 8, 2005, TV Patrol World aired a special edition as a conclusion to ABS-CBN's all-afternoon live coverage of the [[Funeral of Pope John Paul II|burial]] of [[Pope John Paul II]] dubbed as \"Paalam Ama Mula Sa Bayang Minahal Mo\" (\"Goodbye Pope, from the Country you Loved\"). Korina Sanchez and [[Dong Puno]] anchored live from the ABS-CBN Newscenter in [[Quezon City]] as Julius Babao and Karen Davila joined Lynda Jumilla live from the [[Vatican City]], and Henry Omaga-Diaz reported from the Papal memorial in Luneta Park, Manila.\n\nOn June 5, 2006, TV Patrol World updated its logo design, soundtrack, opening billboard, and graphics but the news format remained the same.\n\nIn January 2007, TV Patrol World started to celebrate its 20th anniversary by launching ''[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs#iPatrol Mo!|Boto Mo I-Patrol Mo!]]'', an expansion of the citizen journalism segment ''Citizen Patrol'' for the upcoming [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 midterm elections]].\n\nOn November 25, 2007, ABS-CBN aired a documentary special for TV Patrol's 20th anniversary entitled ''TV Patrol: 20 Taon ng Pagpapatrol'' (TV Patrol: 20 Years of Patrolling). It was produced by ABS-CBN and [[Jesuit Communications Foundation|Jesuit Communications]].\n\nDays after the documentary was aired, TV Patrol's November 29, 2007 edition morphed into ''[[News Patrol]] Special Edition'' covering the events surrounding the [[Manila Peninsula siege]]. Anchored by Ted Failon and Korina Sanchez as part of the special ABS-CBN coverage of the rebellion during the day, the edition shocked millions as it featured live the last few hours of the rebellion, including the arrest of ABS-CBN newscaster/anchor Ces Ore\u00f1a-Drilon and scores of local and foreign media personalities by the Philippine military for allegedly conspiring with the rebellion perpetrators.\n\nOn March 31, 2008, TV Patrol unveiled its new set, graphics (with the same red, green, and blue hues identified with the ABS-CBN logo), opening billboard, and new segments, but it retained some of its old segments. The new look is accompanied by slight changes in Patrol's segments, particularly  ''Citizen Patrol'', and the introduction of ''Hulog ng Langit'', which was specially anchored by Bernadette Sembrano.<ref>{{Cite news | title=TV Patrol World's 'refreshed' look coming Monday | date=March 27, 2008 | publisher=abs-cbnNEWS.com | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryID=113258 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> The same year, ''Boto Mo I-Patrol Mo'' temporarily became ''Bayan Mo I-Patrol Mo''.\n\nDuring this period, the newscast held the highest nationwide TV ratings record since Taylon Nelson Sofres (TNS) started conducting its nationwide TV ratings survey when its April 16, 2009 edition of the newscast featured the developing story of the tragedy involving the wife of anchor Ted Failon.<ref>{{Cite news| title=TNS National TV Ratings (April 17\u201320): Kambal sa Uma bites its way to TV Daytime Supremacy | date=April 21, 2009 | publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal | url=http://www.pep.ph/news/21536/TNS-National-TV-Ratings-(April-17-20):-%3Cem%3EKambal-Sa-Uma%3C-em%3E-bites-its-way-to-daytime-supremacy}}</ref> This tragedy was the reason of Ted Failon's leave that lasted until June 2009.\n\nOn May 11, 2009, a year before the [[2010 Philippine general election|2010 elections]], TV Patrol World relaunched ''Boto Mo I-Patrol Mo'' with the battlecry ''Ako Ang Simula''. On August 5 of the same year, TV Patrol World had its longest broadcast in its history that time as it covered at Manila Memorial Park in [[Para\u00f1aque]] the arrival and burial of the remains of President [[Corazon Aquino]] who died four days earlier. Julius Babao anchored the August 5 edition with Ted Failon and Korina Sanchez, with the two anchoring the ABS-CBN special broadcast \"Salamat President Cory: Ang Huling Paalam\" since morning. Karen Davila joined Henry Omaga Diaz and Ces Orena Drilon with other reporters stationed at Manila Memorial Park. Lasting from 6:30pm to close to 9:00pm, the edition was the most widely watched show in Mega Manila and nationwide on that day as cited by TNS and AGB.<ref>{{Cite news | title=TV Patrol's Cory coverage dominates Wednesday ratings | date=August 7, 2009 | publisher=ABS-CBN News | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/08/07/09/tv-patrols-cory-coverage-dominates-wednesday-ratings | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003175120/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/08/07/09/tv-patrols-cory-coverage-dominates-wednesday-ratings | archivedate=October 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===2010: Revert to debut title===\nIn time for President-elect [[Benigno Aquino III|Noynoy Aquino]]'s inauguration, on June 30, 2010, TV Patrol World was reverted to its original title (''TV Patrol'') with a new logo (still using the RGB ABS-CBN colors, this time with ribbons), new opening titles (featuring the TV Patrol logos of the past and the present), and studio setup that will accommodate augmented reality technology alongside ''Bandila.'' TV Patrol also introduced their [https://archive.today/20130116055720/http://tvpatrol.abs-cbnnews.com/ first main website], and also launched its [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] pages. Ted Failon, Karen Davila, and Julius Babao were retained as the anchors for the weeknight editions as well as Bernadette Sembrano and Alex Santos as anchors for the weekend edition.\n\nTV Patrol covered the [[Manila hostage crisis]] on August 23, 2010 with the longest telecast in its history, lasting for about two and a half hours from 6:30pm to 9:00pm. It was anchored by Ted Failon and Ces Orena-Drilon at the ABS-CBN Newscenter in Quezon City, and Julius Babao at the [[Quirino Grandstand]] where the hostage taking took place. The edition covered the tragic conclusion to the Manila hostage crisis to millions of viewers worldwide. The August 23 edition drew flak from various concerned viewers making ABS-CBN News revise its Code of Ethics. It eventually got a Finalist nod in the 2011 New York Festivals.\n\nOn October 4 of the same year, a new program segment, ''Winner sa Life!'' with Winnie Cordero was launched with reports on lifestyle and tips on proper living.\n\n===2010\u20132012: Return of former anchors===\nOn November 3, 2010, ABS-CBN announced the return of former [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Noli de Castro|\"Kabayan\" Noli de Castro]] and [[Korina Sanchez]] as weeknight anchors of TV Patrol replacing [[Julius Babao]] and [[Karen Davila]], and they joined [[Ted Failon]] on November 8, 2010.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Karen, Julius bid goodbye to TV Patrol viewers | date=November 5, 2010 | publisher=ABS-CBN News | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/current-affairs-programs/tv-patrol/11/05/10/karen-julius-bid-goodbye-tv-patrol-viewers | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127090708/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/current-affairs-programs/tv-patrol/11/05/10/karen-julius-bid-goodbye-tv-patrol-viewers | archivedate=January 27, 2011 }}</ref> The reformat introduced some minor changes to the logo, graphics, title cards, opening billboard, and enhanced set design that reflects the \"white\" color scheme used throughout the news program.\n\nOn the same day as the relaunch, Gretchen Fullido replaced Phoemela Baranda as the segment host for Star Patrol, while Bernadette Sembrano was retained as segment host and reporter for Lingkod Kapamilya. A week later after the relaunch, Kim Atienza returned as a weather forecaster after a long absence since August due to heart problems, while Marc Logan was later reinstated as humor and features reporter.\n\nAnother new innovation is the ''Pulso ng Bayan'' (''People's Pulse'') segment, aired on selected Fridays beginning on the same month as the relaunch, that aims to reach to the common people about the issues being raised and broadcast on the newscast. Noli De Castro always hosts this weekly segment and goes out into the streets to ask the people about their reactions about the important news of the week.\n\nIn February 2011, TV Patrol launched its weekday text poll, the first in Philippine television news history, where texters can choose to agree or disagree at the current issues being broadcast in the program. The text poll happens from Monday to Thursday, but was soon expanded to Fridays. Before the end of the newscast, the three anchors give their opinions about the result of the text poll, similar to the PULSO segment popularized during the time when the late Frankie Evangelista and Mel Tiangco were still part of the anchor team with Noli De Castro. Later, new patriotic segments like ''Panalo 'To!'' (''It's a Winner!'') and ''Lakas ng Pinoy'' (''Pinoy's Strength'') debuted in April of the same year.\n\n===March 5, 2012: 25th Anniversary special reformat===\nOn March 5, 2012, to celebrate TV Patrol's 25th anniversary, TV Patrol reformatted their graphics and introduced a new logo (still using the \"ribbons\" theme) and new opening titles (featuring the TV Patrol logos of the past and the present). A retrospective segment was also added in to commemorate the best events covered during the first 25 years. April 2, 2012 saw newly improved weather graphics and reporting (ABS-CBN Weather Center - in a nod to earlier reports in the past) debut, including a five-day forecast.\n\nCommemorative activities include 25 marker openings in various parts of the country to honor the many important events marked in the first 25 years, and a fund-raising drive aimed at giving back to those who became part of the news coverages through the years.\n\nA new segment, ''CCTV'' (''Concerned Citizens Taking Videos'') ''Patrol'', was launched on June 25, 2012 aimed at citizen journalism and even utilizing CCTV footage and even cellphone footage from the public to convey the latest local news events.\n\nOn July 29, 2012, TV Patrol's anniversary documentary premiered, it was replayed on August 12 due to public demand.\n\nOn September 17, 2012, the brand new segment ''Kabayan Special Patrol'' anchored by De Castro himself continues the program's mission of bringing the latest issues to television viewers all over the nation and globally.\n\n===2013\u20132015: New reformat===\nOn July 29, 2013, TV Patrol, alongside ''[[Bandila (TV program)|Bandila]]'', reformatted their logo, opening titles, and graphics. The redesigned logo is still based on the \"ribbons\" theme, although more simplified. A new set was also seen with a brighter flooring and background. The program dropped the '25' on its official logo, and new segment icons debuted. However the ''Kabayan Special Patrol'' segment icon stayed the same.\n\nOn 2014 saw the launch of an all new program segment, ''ABS-CBN News Investigative Reports'', debuting from March the same year, giving viewers nationwide of an insight towards various scandals and problems in society. [[Henry Omaga-Diaz]], Gigi Grande, and Raffy Santos usually filled their investigative reports in this segment.\n\nOn April 2015 witnessed the launch of the tourism-oriented ''Tara, Grets'' segment with [[Gretchen Fullido]] as anchor, itself a spin off of the Star Patrol segment. Aside from its all access and behind the scenes reports on ABS-CBN programs and network talents, it also promotes the Philippines' many tourist destinations. First aired on weekdays, some editions are now aired as part of the weekend bulletin.\n\nOn May 15, 2015, actress and model [[Yam Concepcion]] filled in for Gretchen Fullido for the segment ''Star Patrol'' marking the first time in the newscast that a celebrity would fill-in for her (unlike Ginger Conejero, Marie Lozano and [[Tina Marasigan]], who have been part of the News and Current Affairs Division). It earned praise from social media that some requested her to come back again on the newscast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/05/15/15/why-tv-patrol-viewers-praised-yam-concepcion|title=Why 'TV Patrol' viewers praised Yam Concepcion|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Failon, Sembrano, De Castro era===\n{{main|Ted Failon|Bernadette Sembrano}}\nTV Patrol's opening billboard and title card was slightly updated on August 3, 2015 to reflect [[Bernadette Sembrano]]'s promotion to main weeknight anchor. Sembrano permanently replaced Sanchez as she is on an indefinite leave due to the [[Mar Roxas presidential campaign, 2016|impending campaign]] of her husband [[Mar Roxas]] as president for the upcoming 2016 presidential elections. This also marks her return to the anchor chair after 4 years she left her weekend anchor stint. Earlier in the year, given Sanchez's leave to pursue master's studies, Sembrano and Ces Drilon served as substitute anchors for the national newscast.\n\nLike Concepcion, on August 5, 2015, Loren Burgos of the Star Magic Angels substituted for Fullido on Star Patrol and on September 18, 2015, Ateneo volleyball player [[Gretchen Ho]] also did the same thing, this time doing the Star and Sports Patrol reports respectively (making her the first ever guest sports reporter in the program's history and the first to do 2 segment reports) which earned praises in social media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/6EOjNQzbMA/|title=Loren Burgos on Instagram: \u201cThanks again @tvpatrolabscbn2 @abscbnnews for choosing me as a guest presenter on Star Patrol! \ud83d\ude04 Blessed to have met and worked with these\u2026\u201d|website=Instagram}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/09/18/15/watch-gretchen-hos-tv-patrol-debut|title=LOOK: Gretchen Ho's TV Patrol debut|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>\n\nFrom June 25 to July 3, 2016, the main studio for this program (including the weekend edition) and ''[[Bandila (TV program)|Bandila]]'' underwent major renovations, that caused both programs to be broadcast temporarily from the ABS-CBN News' newsroom (the [[Inauguration of Rodrigo Duterte|June 30]] edition of this program was broadcast from the newsroom where ANC's newscasts are located and from the ABS-CBN News newsroom).\n\nOn July 4, 2016, as a part of their new trio and new era, ''TV Patrol'' and ''Bandila'' revamped its opening billboards, graphics, lower thirds; while the logos for both programs remained the same, the logos were presented in a 3D-like format. Also, both programs are broadcast in a newly renovated set, which includes a large screen display, Augmented Reality and green chroma set. And for the first time since 2004, this program is now presented in a hybrid news delivery format (most of the show will be presented in a standup format while some will be delivered in a sit down format, mostly for de Castro parts). New segment icons debuted to match the new set. (The ''Kabayan Special Patrol'' and ''Winner sa Life'' new segment icons would later come in September).\n\nOn October 19, 2016, Kim Atienza got his own studio set for the weather reports being shown on the program.\n\n====March 2, 2017: 30th Anniversary====\nOn March 2, 2017, TV Patrol celebrated its 30th anniversary and it featured a live newscast in its studio in Manila, and its sister stations in Tacloban and Zamboanga. Sembrano was situated at the ABS-CBN studio in Manila while Failon was in Tacloban and De Castro in Zamboanga.\n\nPart of the celebrations included the debut of new segments: ''Red Alert'' with [[Atom Araullo]] (emergency preparednesses, later replaced by [[Jeff Canoy]]), ''How to be You Po'', ''Fast Talk'' and ''Tarang-Tanong'' (celebrity interviews during the Star Patrol segment) and ''DyanFit'' (physical fitness tips). In June, a new music video debuted to mark the event.\n\nBeginning August 24, 2017, the show featured celebrities as ''Star Patrol'' guest anchors, a segment that has been returned after quite some time.  [[Yassi Pressman]], [[Toni Gonzaga]], [[Bela Padilla]], [[Kim Chiu]], [[Bianca Gonzales]], [[Erich Gonzales]], [[Kylie Verzosa]], Mariel de Leon, [[Janella Salvador]], [[Aiko Melendez]], [[Karylle]], [[Karla Estrada]], and [[Anne Curtis]] filled in the slot of Fullido occasionally. This anniversary year has seen the newscast using augumented graphics for several news stories being featured.\n\n====April 2, 2018: Switch to high definition (HD)====\nAfter 31 years of broadcasting in Standard Definition ([[480i]], [[4:3]] [[SDTV]]) format, ''TV Patrol'' finally switched to High Definition ([[1080i]], [[16:9]] [[HDTV]]) format starting on April 1, 2018, together with the other news programs ''[[Bandila (TV program)|Bandila]]'', ''[[Umagang Kay Ganda]]'', and ''[[News Patrol]]''.

In time for the Christmas holidays, another segment featuring good news items, ''Happinews'', debuted in December 2018, previously the segment featured reports from the namesake tour which began in April in several Metro Manila area universities.\n\nOn April 21, 2019, TV Patrol, along with ''[[Bandila]]'', was transferred back to the ABS-CBN Newsroom as Studio 7 is being prepared for the network's coverage of the [[2019 Philippine general election|2019 midterm election]] titled as ''Halalan 2019''. (''[[News Patrol]]'' & ''[[Headline Pilipinas]]'', was relocated to the former studio of [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|S+A]]'s  ''[[The Score (Philippine TV program)|The Score]]'' is  based). The newscast returned to the newly-renovated studio on May 13 during the aforementioned coverage while retaining its OBB, logo, and graphics in which that its used since 2016, as well as theme song which is used since 2010.\n\nOn March 16, 2020, TV Patrol began to air its replay temporarily on a late night timeslot replacing the timeslot of late night newscast ''[[Bandila]]'' as provisional programming, which is part of the country\u2019s enhanced community quarantine done to stop the spread of the Wuhan COVID-19 in the Philippines. On the same day, it began to simulcast on the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]].\n\n==Weekend edition==\nAfter a brief time in the mid-1980s and 1990s, TV Patrol first aired on weekends as an occasional special broadcast. Its first weekend broadcast In September 2001 featured news about the battle between the American forces and the Taliban-led Afghan forces during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and also covered the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] at the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in New York.

It is complemented with ''[[The Weekend News (ABS-CBN)|The Weekend News]]'' as ABS-CBN's weekend newscasts until the latter cancelled three years later. During this period, the weekend editions used to occupy middle evening time slots between 8:00 pm, and 10:00 pm, Ces Ore\u00f1a-Drilon left the weekend edition for ''[[ABS-CBN Insider]]'' In 2005, and was replaced by [[Bernadette Sembrano]].\n\nOn July 8, 2006, [[Alex Santos (newscaster)|Alex Santos]] replaced [[Henry Omaga-Diaz]] after the latter left the show for ''[[Bandila (TV program)|Bandila]]'' on July 2. The weekend editions stopped their simulcast over DZMM and moved to its present early evening time slot upon his arrival. However the Sunday telecast in several years remained in the mid-evening slots until 2010.\n\nIn 2010, three days after the first 2010 revamp, the two weekend editions merged into ''TV Patrol Weekend''.\n\nIn recent editions, a new segment called ''Kuwentong Obrero'' (''Workers' Story'') is fitted into the newscast, which tackles the Philippines' great labor sector.\n\nOn November 26, 2011, [[Alex Santos (newscaster)|Alex Santos]] and [[Bernadette Sembrano]] were replaced by [[Pinky Webb]] and [[Alvin Elchico]].<ref>[http://www.abs-cbn.com/Feature/Article/10515/Pinky-Webb-and-Alvin-El-Chico-anchor-all-new-TV-Patrol-Weekend-.aspx Pinky Webb and Alvin Elchico anchor all-new TV Patrol Weekend] retrieved via abs-cbn.com 11-28-2011</ref> Unlike on the daily edition and previously on the weekend edition on a stand-up news delivery, the anchors are in sitting on a newsdesk.

However, on the November 9 edition, the first one to be heard on DZMM after 6 years, both of them returned to sitting on the newsdesk.\n\nOn May 6, 2015, in an article published by the Philippine Entertainment Portal and other websites, rumors have been circulated that Webb had resigned from the network and will be moving to [[CNN Philippines]]. With this, viewers didn't see her on the newscast and she was temporarily replaced alternately by May 4, Zen Hernandez until those rumors have been answered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pep.ph/news/local/52131/pinky-webb-leaves-abs-cbn-to-join-cnn-philippines|title=Pinky Webb leaves ABS-CBN to join CNN Philippines?|website=PEP.ph}}</ref>\n\nOn July 9, 2016, prior to the revamp of the opening billboards, graphics and set which were launched on July 4, Zen Hernandez was named the permanent replacement of Webb, joining Elchico.

Fixed dates below are based on the History section of the article shown above. -->\n''TV Patrol'' originally used [[Vangelis]]'s \"Pulstar\" as its very first theme music, from March 2, 1987 until November 4, 1994.\n\nIn November 7, 1994, \"Pulstar\" was replaced by [[Ryan Cayabyab]]'s \"ABS-CBN News Theme\", which served as the theme of ''TV Patrol'' and the [[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs|ABS-CBN News and Public Affairs]] division until 1996. The theme is currently used as a theme music for ''[[The World Tonight (Philippine newscast)|The World Tonight]]'' which was moved to [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] (ANC) in 1999, with slight and more modern re-composition.\n\nIn 1996, when [[Noli de Castro]] became the sole anchor of the newscast, it adopted [[Frank Gari|Gari Communications]]' \"Allegro\" from [[KPIX-TV]], a [[CBS]]-owned TV station in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Although, the news theme had also been used by [[KBAK-TV]], a former [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and currently a [[CBS]] affiliate in [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California until 1997.\n\nOn March 12, 2001, when De Castro left the show for the elections and Korina Sanchez, Henry Omaga Diaz and Aljo Bendijo replaced him as the new anchors, the Filipino composition of ''Allegro'' was done with elements from the orchestra version and combines the elements of the original 1996-2001 version, the 1994-1996 ABS-CBN News Theme, and the ABS-CBN's jingle.\n\nThe theme underwent re-compositions in 2002, which was also used by ''TV Patrol Sabado/Linggo'' from 2004\u201306, 2004, and 2006, which was rearranged and composed by [[Neocolours]]'s Jimmy Antiporda.\n\nThe theme music from June 30, 2010 to present, which incorporates the elements of \"Pulstar\", ''TV Patrol''<nowiki/>'s 2001 theme, and ''TV Patrol World''<nowiki/>'s 2004 and 2006 theme music.\n\n==Anchors==\n[[File:TV Patroljf0191 07.JPG|thumb|Jasmine Romero and TV Patrol crew at Paco-Dilao Church]]\n\n===Weeknight anchors===\n* [[Noli de Castro]] <small>(main anchor, 1987\u20132001, 2010\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Bernadette Sembrano]] <small>(weekend anchor, 2005\u20132011;

All regional editions airs at about 5:00{{nbsp}}PM (right before the network's ''Primetime Bida'' evening block), with selected editions simulcast over [[The Filipino Channel]] for overseas viewers. Several newscasts were also aired nationwide from August 2016 to January 2018 on [[ABS-CBN Regional Channel]] via [[Sky Cable]], [[Destiny Cable]] and [[Sky Direct]]. The ABS-CBN News [[YouTube]] page also included archived videos of past editions since recently for those who have not watched the program as well as for overseas viewers.\n\nIn June 2018, the Regional division merged selected newscasts into super regions. The cutbacks initially left the Southern Luzon (Bicol, Southern Tagalog, Palawan), the Visayas (Panay, Negros, Central Visayas and Eastern Visayas), Chavacano and Southern Mindanao editions unchanged; standalone newscasts in North Central Luzon, Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, Caraga and Central Mindanao officially ended their telecasts on June 29, and were merged to their relevant control hubs in Baguio, Cagayan de Oro and General Santos from July 2. The merger was compensated by adding daily ''News Patrol'' bulletins in its respective super regions.\n\nThe Pampanga newscast was also axed after its June 29 edition; however, as [[DWIN-TV|TV-46 Pampanga]] was downgraded into a semi-satellite station for [[DWWX-TV|Channel 2 Manila]], the newscast was then scaled down as a short local ''News Patrol'' bulletin in July 2.<ref>[https://fromthetube.wordpress.com/2018/06/25/abs-cbn-regional-cancels-agri-tayo-dito-magtv-na/ ABS-CBN Regional cancels Agri Tayo Dito, MagTV na] accessed June 30, 2018</ref> News reports from there were later included, either as part of the North Luzon edition or integrated to the national newscast itself from August of the same year (Pampanga reports for the North Luzon edition were shelved one month later). The same ''News Patrol'' edition was eventually merged with the North Luzon edition itself, effective from May 20, 2019 (11 months after being axed), but was added a Kapampagan opt-out aired

The signature line went popularized until November 19, 2004, the day [[Korina Sanchez]] first left the newscast, and again since November 8, 2010, the day of his reinstatement.\n\nSegment anchors included [[Ernie Baron]], who served as the newscast's chief meteorologist and provided viewers trivia pertaining to science and history, and actress-personality Angelique Lazo (now with [[People's Television Network|PTV]]), who first hosted Star News, an entertainment news segment.<ref name=\"abs-cbnnews.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/current-affairs-programs/03/02/12/tv-patrol-turns-25|title=TV Patrol turns 25|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/04/07/12/star-patrollers-join-dumauals-25th-wedding-anniversary|title=Star Patrollers join Dumauals' 25th wedding anniversary|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>\n\nThe style of the newscast, according to De Castro, was eventually \"Tabloid on the Air\".\nMost of its segments were: \"Wanted\" (later became Pulis Report), & Lingkod Bayan: Ang Puso ng TV Patrol.\n\nHowever, Arevalo eventually left the newscast to host the morning show ''[[Magandang Umaga Po]]'' (previously known as ''Good Morning, Philippines'' and ''Magandang Umaga''). [[Frankie Evangelista]] swapped for him on June 1, 1987. Evangelista would later be notable for his TV Patrol discussion segment entitled ''PULSO: Pangkalahatang Ugnayan Laan Sa Opinyon'' (PULSE: Overall Correlation Reserved for Opinions).\n\nWith the introduction of international broadcasts in 1989 to the Pacific islands of [[Guam]] and [[Saipan]], and later with the birth of [[The Filipino Channel]] in 1994, TV Patrol became the first Philippine newscast and program to be broadcast overseas. It still does so today, now in an expanded reach through TFC and the live web streaming on its official webpage.\n\nIn 1992, both [[Korina Sanchez]] and [[Ted Failon]] temporarily took over Tiangco's and Evangelista's chairs until TV Patrol underwent changes on its theme and title card the same year. [[Christine Bersola-Babao|Christine Bersola]] joined the newscast a year later to host Star News until 1996.\n\nIn 1995, [[Korina Sanchez]], who is from Hoy Gising replaced Tiangco to TV Patrol's anchor when the latter moved to [[GMA Network]] after being suspended from doing a TV commercial. Sanchez's as anchor then who would also be placed in Tiangco's seat. The former continued anchoring Tiangco's ''Lingkod Bayan'', a public service segment of the newscast. [[Ted Failon]] replaced Evangelista in TV Patrol and continued anchoring Evangelista's ''PULSO: Pangkalahatang Ugnayan Laan Sa Opinyon'' (PULSE: Overall Correlation Reserved for Opinions).\n\nIn 1996, the broadcast had begun to cut its airing time to 30 minutes when [[Noli de Castro]] became the sole anchor of the newscast with [[Henry Omaga-Diaz]] as his substitute anchor. The newscast was reformatted with a brand new logo (constant version changes) and theme music. This style became identical to the American television network news programs [[ABC World News Tonight]], [[CBS Evening News]] and [[NBC Nightly News]]. [[Marc Logan (broadcast journalist)|Marc Logan]] was hired to become the news reader of trivial segments and features. On January 4, 1999, the newscast returned its airtime to one hour. On February 14, 2000, TV Patrol started its simulcast over AM radio stations [[DZMM-AM|DZMM]] (Manila), [[DYAB-AM|DYAB]] (Cebu), and [[DXAB]] (Davao) and began its online presence through the ABS-CBN News website. On February 23, 2001, De Castro left the newscast to [[2001 Philippine general election|run]] for [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]].

During that time, Sanchez was situated on news studio, while Bendijo anchored outside the studio.\n\nOn April 21, 2003, TV Patrol relaunched its studio set, newsdesk and graphics, along with the theme music & a silhouetted OBB.

The September 24, 2003 edition, which featured Kris' interview, ate up most of the newscast's airtime, making it extend beyond its 6:30\u20138:00pm time slot. According to AGB, the edition, the longest in its history back then, garnered a rating of 47.2% in [[Mega Manila]].<ref>{{Cite news| title=GMA-7 not bothered by ABS-CBN ratings surge | date=September 28, 2003 | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer | url=http://www.inq7.net/ent/2003/sep/28/ent_2-1.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Julius Babao later joined the news studio, which would expand the set with a video wall. Aside from its reformat, TV Patrol launches its new slogan \"Subok nang Maasahan\" based on ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs 2004 slogan.\n\nIn September 2004, the ratings of TV Patrol started to decline, since it faced with rival [[GMA Network]]'s new early evening newscast [[24 Oras]]. Thus, the ABS-CBN management needed to relaunch TV Patrol before the year ends. [[Korina Sanchez]] left the newscast on November 19, 2004, in line with the network's effort to regain top slot in the ratings and to make way for the relaunch of the newscast as TV Patrol World.<ref name=\"TVPatrolWorld\"/>\n\n===2004\u20132010: TV Patrol World===\nOn November 22, 2004, TV Patrol relaunched as TV Patrol World to give weight to reports from Filipino communities worldwide. [[Julius Babao]] was joined by [[Ted Failon]] and [[Karen Davila]] as its main anchors, while special segments are anchored by [[Ernie Baron]], [[Phoemela Baranda]], and [[Bernadette Sembrano]], Davila's colleague from [[GMA Network]]. The name \"World\" became related to [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]]'s former [[English language]] late-night newscast [[The World Tonight (Philippine newscast)|The World Tonight]] which was later transferred to [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] in 1999 and it airs until this day. For the first time, the newscast used a full stand-up delivery. Ernie Baron died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on January 23, 2006 and months later, he was replaced by [[Kim Atienza]] as the newscast's resident weatherman.\n\nOn April 8, 2005, TV Patrol World aired a special edition as a conclusion to ABS-CBN's all-afternoon live coverage of the [[Funeral of Pope John Paul II|burial]] of [[Pope John Paul II]] dubbed as \"Paalam Ama Mula Sa Bayang Minahal Mo\" (\"Goodbye Pope, from the Country you Loved\"). Korina Sanchez and [[Dong Puno]] anchored live from the ABS-CBN Newscenter in [[Quezon City]] as Julius Babao and Karen Davila joined Lynda Jumilla live from the [[Vatican City]], and Henry Omaga-Diaz reported from the Papal memorial in Luneta Park, Manila.\n\nOn June 5, 2006, TV Patrol World updated its logo design, soundtrack, opening billboard, and graphics but the news format remained the same.\n\nIn January 2007, TV Patrol World started to celebrate its 20th anniversary by launching ''[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs#iPatrol Mo!|Boto Mo I-Patrol Mo!]]'', an expansion of the citizen journalism segment ''Citizen Patrol'' for the upcoming [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 midterm elections]].\n\nOn November 25, 2007, ABS-CBN aired a documentary special for TV Patrol's 20th anniversary entitled ''TV Patrol: 20 Taon ng Pagpapatrol'' (TV Patrol: 20 Years of Patrolling). It was produced by ABS-CBN and [[Jesuit Communications Foundation|Jesuit Communications]].\n\nDays after the documentary was aired, TV Patrol's November 29, 2007 edition morphed into ''[[News Patrol]] Special Edition'' covering the events surrounding the [[Manila Peninsula siege]]. Anchored by Ted Failon and Korina Sanchez as part of the special ABS-CBN coverage of the rebellion during the day, the edition shocked millions as it featured live the last few hours of the rebellion, including the arrest of ABS-CBN newscaster/anchor Ces Ore\u00f1a-Drilon and scores of local and foreign media personalities by the Philippine military for allegedly conspiring with the rebellion perpetrators.\n\nOn March 31, 2008, TV Patrol unveiled its new set, graphics (with the same red, green, and blue hues identified with the ABS-CBN logo), opening billboard, and new segments, but it retained some of its old segments. The new look is accompanied by slight changes in Patrol's segments, particularly  ''Citizen Patrol'', and the introduction of ''Hulog ng Langit'', which was specially anchored by Bernadette Sembrano.<ref>{{Cite news | title=TV Patrol World's 'refreshed' look coming Monday | date=March 27, 2008 | publisher=abs-cbnNEWS.com | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryID=113258 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> The same year, ''Boto Mo I-Patrol Mo'' temporarily became ''Bayan Mo I-Patrol Mo''.\n\nDuring this period, the newscast held the highest nationwide TV ratings record since Taylon Nelson Sofres (TNS) started conducting its nationwide TV ratings survey when its April 16, 2009 edition of the newscast featured the developing story of the tragedy involving the wife of anchor Ted Failon.<ref>{{Cite news| title=TNS National TV Ratings (April 17\u201320): Kambal sa Uma bites its way to TV Daytime Supremacy | date=April 21, 2009 | publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal | url=http://www.pep.ph/news/21536/TNS-National-TV-Ratings-(April-17-20):-%3Cem%3EKambal-Sa-Uma%3C-em%3E-bites-its-way-to-daytime-supremacy}}</ref> This tragedy was the reason of Ted Failon's leave that lasted until June 2009.\n\nOn May 11, 2009, a year before the [[2010 Philippine general election|2010 elections]], TV Patrol World relaunched ''Boto Mo I-Patrol Mo'' with the battlecry ''Ako Ang Simula''. On August 5 of the same year, TV Patrol World had its longest broadcast in its history that time as it covered at Manila Memorial Park in [[Para\u00f1aque]] the arrival and burial of the remains of President [[Corazon Aquino]] who died four days earlier. Julius Babao anchored the August 5 edition with Ted Failon and Korina Sanchez, with the two anchoring the ABS-CBN special broadcast \"Salamat President Cory: Ang Huling Paalam\" since morning. Karen Davila joined Henry Omaga Diaz and Ces Orena Drilon with other reporters stationed at Manila Memorial Park. Lasting from 6:30pm to close to 9:00pm, the edition was the most widely watched show in Mega Manila and nationwide on that day as cited by TNS and AGB.<ref>{{Cite news | title=TV Patrol's Cory coverage dominates Wednesday ratings | date=August 7, 2009 | publisher=ABS-CBN News | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/08/07/09/tv-patrols-cory-coverage-dominates-wednesday-ratings | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003175120/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/08/07/09/tv-patrols-cory-coverage-dominates-wednesday-ratings | archivedate=October 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===2010: Revert to debut title===\nIn time for President-elect [[Benigno Aquino III|Noynoy Aquino]]'s inauguration, on June 30, 2010, TV Patrol World was reverted to its original title (''TV Patrol'') with a new logo (still using the RGB ABS-CBN colors, this time with ribbons), new opening titles (featuring the TV Patrol logos of the past and the present), and studio setup that will accommodate augmented reality technology alongside ''Bandila.'' TV Patrol also introduced their [https://archive.today/20130116055720/http://tvpatrol.abs-cbnnews.com/ first main website], and also launched its [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] pages. Ted Failon, Karen Davila, and Julius Babao were retained as the anchors for the weeknight editions as well as Bernadette Sembrano and Alex Santos as anchors for the weekend edition.\n\nTV Patrol covered the [[Manila hostage crisis]] on August 23, 2010 with the longest telecast in its history, lasting for about two and a half hours from 6:30pm to 9:00pm. It was anchored by Ted Failon and Ces Orena-Drilon at the ABS-CBN Newscenter in Quezon City, and Julius Babao at the [[Quirino Grandstand]] where the hostage taking took place. The edition covered the tragic conclusion to the Manila hostage crisis to millions of viewers worldwide. The August 23 edition drew flak from various concerned viewers making ABS-CBN News revise its Code of Ethics. It eventually got a Finalist nod in the 2011 New York Festivals.\n\nOn October 4 of the same year, a new program segment, ''Winner sa Life!'' with Winnie Cordero was launched with reports on lifestyle and tips on proper living.\n\n===2010\u20132012: Return of former anchors===\nOn November 3, 2010, ABS-CBN announced the return of former [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Noli de Castro|\"Kabayan\" Noli de Castro]] and [[Korina Sanchez]] as weeknight anchors of TV Patrol replacing [[Julius Babao]] and [[Karen Davila]], and they joined [[Ted Failon]] on November 8, 2010.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Karen, Julius bid goodbye to TV Patrol viewers | date=November 5, 2010 | publisher=ABS-CBN News | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/current-affairs-programs/tv-patrol/11/05/10/karen-julius-bid-goodbye-tv-patrol-viewers | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127090708/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/current-affairs-programs/tv-patrol/11/05/10/karen-julius-bid-goodbye-tv-patrol-viewers | archivedate=January 27, 2011 }}</ref> The reformat introduced some minor changes to the logo, graphics, title cards, opening billboard, and enhanced set design that reflects the \"white\" color scheme used throughout the news program.\n\nOn the same day as the relaunch, Gretchen Fullido replaced Phoemela Baranda as the segment host for Star Patrol, while Bernadette Sembrano was retained as segment host and reporter for Lingkod Kapamilya. A week later after the relaunch, Kim Atienza returned as a weather forecaster after a long absence since August due to heart problems, while Marc Logan was later reinstated as humor and features reporter.\n\nAnother new innovation is the ''Pulso ng Bayan'' (''People's Pulse'') segment, aired on selected Fridays beginning on the same month as the relaunch, that aims to reach to the common people about the issues being raised and broadcast on the newscast. Noli De Castro always hosts this weekly segment and goes out into the streets to ask the people about their reactions about the important news of the week.\n\nIn February 2011, TV Patrol launched its weekday text poll, the first in Philippine television news history, where texters can choose to agree or disagree at the current issues being broadcast in the program. The text poll happens from Monday to Thursday, but was soon expanded to Fridays. Before the end of the newscast, the three anchors give their opinions about the result of the text poll, similar to the PULSO segment popularized during the time when the late Frankie Evangelista and Mel Tiangco were still part of the anchor team with Noli De Castro. Later, new patriotic segments like ''Panalo 'To!'' (''It's a Winner!'') and ''Lakas ng Pinoy'' (''Pinoy's Strength'') debuted in April of the same year.\n\n===March 5, 2012: 25th Anniversary special reformat===\nOn March 5, 2012, to celebrate TV Patrol's 25th anniversary, TV Patrol reformatted their graphics and introduced a new logo (still using the \"ribbons\" theme) and new opening titles (featuring the TV Patrol logos of the past and the present). A retrospective segment was also added in to commemorate the best events covered during the first 25 years. April 2, 2012 saw newly improved weather graphics and reporting (ABS-CBN Weather Center - in a nod to earlier reports in the past) debut, including a five-day forecast.\n\nCommemorative activities include 25 marker openings in various parts of the country to honor the many important events marked in the first 25 years, and a fund-raising drive aimed at giving back to those who became part of the news coverages through the years.\n\nA new segment, ''CCTV'' (''Concerned Citizens Taking Videos'') ''Patrol'', was launched on June 25, 2012 aimed at citizen journalism and even utilizing CCTV footage and even cellphone footage from the public to convey the latest local news events.\n\nOn July 29, 2012, TV Patrol's anniversary documentary premiered, it was replayed on August 12 due to public demand.\n\nOn September 17, 2012, the brand new segment ''Kabayan Special Patrol'' anchored by De Castro himself continues the program's mission of bringing the latest issues to television viewers all over the nation and globally.\n\n===2013\u20132015: New reformat===\nOn July 29, 2013, TV Patrol, alongside ''[[Bandila (TV program)|Bandila]]'', reformatted their logo, opening titles, and graphics. The redesigned logo is still based on the \"ribbons\" theme, although more simplified. A new set was also seen with a brighter flooring and background. The program dropped the '25' on its official logo, and new segment icons debuted. However the ''Kabayan Special Patrol'' segment icon stayed the same.\n\nOn 2014 saw the launch of an all new program segment, ''ABS-CBN News Investigative Reports'', debuting from March the same year, giving viewers nationwide of an insight towards various scandals and problems in society. [[Henry Omaga-Diaz]], Gigi Grande, and Raffy Santos usually filled their investigative reports in this segment.\n\nOn April 2015 witnessed the launch of the tourism-oriented ''Tara, Grets'' segment with [[Gretchen Fullido]] as anchor, itself a spin off of the Star Patrol segment. Aside from its all access and behind the scenes reports on ABS-CBN programs and network talents, it also promotes the Philippines' many tourist destinations. First aired on weekdays, some editions are now aired as part of the weekend bulletin.\n\nOn May 15, 2015, actress and model [[Yam Concepcion]] filled in for Gretchen Fullido for the segment ''Star Patrol'' marking the first time in the newscast that a celebrity would fill-in for her (unlike Ginger Conejero, Marie Lozano and [[Tina Marasigan]], who have been part of the News and Current Affairs Division). It earned praise from social media that some requested her to come back again on the newscast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/05/15/15/why-tv-patrol-viewers-praised-yam-concepcion|title=Why 'TV Patrol' viewers praised Yam Concepcion|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Failon, Sembrano, De Castro era===\n{{main|Ted Failon|Bernadette Sembrano}}\nTV Patrol's opening billboard and title card was slightly updated on August 3, 2015 to reflect [[Bernadette Sembrano]]'s promotion to main weeknight anchor. Sembrano permanently replaced Sanchez as she is on an indefinite leave due to the [[Mar Roxas presidential campaign, 2016|impending campaign]] of her husband [[Mar Roxas]] as president for the upcoming 2016 presidential elections. This also marks her return to the anchor chair after 4 years she left her weekend anchor stint. Earlier in the year, given Sanchez's leave to pursue master's studies, Sembrano and Ces Drilon served as substitute anchors for the national newscast.\n\nLike Concepcion, on August 5, 2015, Loren Burgos of the Star Magic Angels substituted for Fullido on Star Patrol and on September 18, 2015, Ateneo volleyball player [[Gretchen Ho]] also did the same thing, this time doing the Star and Sports Patrol reports respectively (making her the first ever guest sports reporter in the program's history and the first to do 2 segment reports) which earned praises in social media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/6EOjNQzbMA/|title=Loren Burgos on Instagram: \u201cThanks again @tvpatrolabscbn2 @abscbnnews for choosing me as a guest presenter on Star Patrol! \ud83d\ude04 Blessed to have met and worked with these\u2026\u201d|website=Instagram}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/09/18/15/watch-gretchen-hos-tv-patrol-debut|title=LOOK: Gretchen Ho's TV Patrol debut|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>\n\nFrom June 25 to July 3, 2016, the main studio for this program (including the weekend edition) and ''[[Bandila (TV program)|Bandila]]'' underwent major renovations, that caused both programs to be broadcast temporarily from the ABS-CBN News' newsroom (the [[Inauguration of Rodrigo Duterte|June 30]] edition of this program was broadcast from the newsroom where ANC's newscasts are located and from the ABS-CBN News newsroom).\n\nOn July 4, 2016, as a part of their new trio and new era, ''TV Patrol'' and ''Bandila'' revamped its opening billboards, graphics, lower thirds; while the logos for both programs remained the same, the logos were presented in a 3D-like format. Also, both programs are broadcast in a newly renovated set, which includes a large screen display, Augmented Reality and green chroma set. And for the first time since 2004, this program is now presented in a hybrid news delivery format (most of the show will be presented in a standup format while some will be delivered in a sit down format, mostly for de Castro parts). New segment icons debuted to match the new set. (The ''Kabayan Special Patrol'' and ''Winner sa Life'' new segment icons would later come in September).\n\nOn October 19, 2016, Kim Atienza got his own studio set for the weather reports being shown on the program.\n\n====March 2, 2017: 30th Anniversary====\nOn March 2, 2017, TV Patrol celebrated its 30th anniversary and it featured a live newscast in its studio in Manila, and its sister stations in Tacloban and Zamboanga. Sembrano was situated at the ABS-CBN studio in Manila while Failon was in Tacloban and De Castro in Zamboanga.\n\nPart of the celebrations included the debut of new segments: ''Red Alert'' with [[Atom Araullo]] (emergency preparednesses, later replaced by [[Jeff Canoy]]), ''How to be You Po'', ''Fast Talk'' and ''Tarang-Tanong'' (celebrity interviews during the Star Patrol segment) and ''DyanFit'' (physical fitness tips). In June, a new music video debuted to mark the event.\n\nBeginning August 24, 2017, the show featured celebrities as ''Star Patrol'' guest anchors, a segment that has been returned after quite some time.  [[Yassi Pressman]], [[Toni Gonzaga]], [[Bela Padilla]], [[Kim Chiu]], [[Bianca Gonzales]], [[Erich Gonzales]], [[Kylie Verzosa]], Mariel de Leon, [[Janella Salvador]], [[Aiko Melendez]], [[Karylle]], [[Karla Estrada]], and [[Anne Curtis]] filled in the slot of Fullido occasionally. This anniversary year has seen the newscast using augumented graphics for several news stories being featured.\n\n====April 2, 2018: Switch to high definition (HD)====\nAfter 31 years of broadcasting in Standard Definition ([[480i]], [[4:3]] [[SDTV]]) format, ''TV Patrol'' finally switched to High Definition ([[1080i]], [[16:9]] [[HDTV]]) format starting on April 1, 2018, together with the other news programs ''[[Bandila (TV program)|Bandila]]'', ''[[Umagang Kay Ganda]]'', and ''[[News Patrol]]''.

In time for the Christmas holidays, another segment featuring good news items, ''Happinews'', debuted in December 2018, previously the segment featured reports from the namesake tour which began in April in several Metro Manila area universities.\n\nOn April 21, 2019, TV Patrol, along with ''[[Bandila]]'', was transferred back to the ABS-CBN Newsroom as Studio 7 is being prepared for the network's coverage of the [[2019 Philippine general election|2019 midterm election]] titled as ''Halalan 2019''. (''[[News Patrol]]'' & ''[[Headline Pilipinas]]'', was relocated to the former studio of [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|S+A]]'s  ''[[The Score (Philippine TV program)|The Score]]'' is  based). The newscast returned to the newly-renovated studio on May 13 during the aforementioned coverage while retaining its OBB, logo, and graphics in which that its used since 2016, as well as theme song which is used since 2010.\n\nOn March 16, 2020, TV Patrol began to air its replay temporarily on a late night timeslot replacing the timeslot of late night newscast ''[[Bandila]]'' as provisional programming, which is part of the country\u2019s enhanced community quarantine done to stop the spread of the Wuhan COVID-19 in the Philippines. On the same day, it began to simulcast on the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]].\n\n==Weekend edition==\nAfter a brief time in the mid-1980s and 1990s, TV Patrol first aired on weekends as an occasional special broadcast. Its first weekend broadcast In September 2001 featured news about the battle between the American forces and the Taliban-led Afghan forces during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and also covered the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] at the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in New York.

It is complemented with ''[[The Weekend News (ABS-CBN)|The Weekend News]]'' as ABS-CBN's weekend newscasts until the latter cancelled three years later. During this period, the weekend editions used to occupy middle evening time slots between 8:00 pm, and 10:00 pm, Ces Ore\u00f1a-Drilon left the weekend edition for ''[[ABS-CBN Insider]]'' In 2005, and was replaced by [[Bernadette Sembrano]].\n\nOn July 8, 2006, [[Alex Santos (newscaster)|Alex Santos]] replaced [[Henry Omaga-Diaz]] after the latter left the show for ''[[Bandila (TV program)|Bandila]]'' on July 2. The weekend editions stopped their simulcast over DZMM and moved to its present early evening time slot upon his arrival. However the Sunday telecast in several years remained in the mid-evening slots until 2010.\n\nIn 2010, three days after the first 2010 revamp, the two weekend editions merged into ''TV Patrol Weekend''.\n\nIn recent editions, a new segment called ''Kuwentong Obrero'' (''Workers' Story'') is fitted into the newscast, which tackles the Philippines' great labor sector.\n\nOn November 26, 2011, [[Alex Santos (newscaster)|Alex Santos]] and [[Bernadette Sembrano]] were replaced by [[Pinky Webb]] and [[Alvin Elchico]].<ref>[http://www.abs-cbn.com/Feature/Article/10515/Pinky-Webb-and-Alvin-El-Chico-anchor-all-new-TV-Patrol-Weekend-.aspx Pinky Webb and Alvin Elchico anchor all-new TV Patrol Weekend] retrieved via abs-cbn.com 11-28-2011</ref> Unlike on the daily edition and previously on the weekend edition on a stand-up news delivery, the anchors are in sitting on a newsdesk.

However, on the November 9 edition, the first one to be heard on DZMM after 6 years, both of them returned to sitting on the newsdesk.\n\nOn May 6, 2015, in an article published by the Philippine Entertainment Portal and other websites, rumors have been circulated that Webb had resigned from the network and will be moving to [[CNN Philippines]]. With this, viewers didn't see her on the newscast and she was temporarily replaced alternately by May 4, Zen Hernandez until those rumors have been answered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pep.ph/news/local/52131/pinky-webb-leaves-abs-cbn-to-join-cnn-philippines|title=Pinky Webb leaves ABS-CBN to join CNN Philippines?|website=PEP.ph}}</ref>\n\nOn July 9, 2016, prior to the revamp of the opening billboards, graphics and set which were launched on July 4, Zen Hernandez was named the permanent replacement of Webb, joining Elchico.

Fixed dates below are based on the History section of the article shown above. -->\n''TV Patrol'' originally used [[Vangelis]]'s \"Pulstar\" as its very first theme music, from March 2, 1987 until November 4, 1994.\n\nIn November 7, 1994, \"Pulstar\" was replaced by [[Ryan Cayabyab]]'s \"ABS-CBN News Theme\", which served as the theme of ''TV Patrol'' and the [[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs|ABS-CBN News and Public Affairs]] division until 1996. The theme is currently used as a theme music for ''[[The World Tonight (Philippine newscast)|The World Tonight]]'' which was moved to [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] (ANC) in 1999, with slight and more modern re-composition.\n\nIn 1996, when [[Noli de Castro]] became the sole anchor of the newscast, it adopted [[Frank Gari|Gari Communications]]' \"Allegro\" from [[KPIX-TV]], a [[CBS]]-owned TV station in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Although, the news theme had also been used by [[KBAK-TV]], a former [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and currently a [[CBS]] affiliate in [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California until 1997.\n\nOn March 12, 2001, when De Castro left the show for the elections and Korina Sanchez, Henry Omaga Diaz and Aljo Bendijo replaced him as the new anchors, the Filipino composition of ''Allegro'' was done with elements from the orchestra version and combines the elements of the original 1996-2001 version, the 1994-1996 ABS-CBN News Theme, and the ABS-CBN's jingle.\n\nThe theme underwent re-compositions in 2002, which was also used by ''TV Patrol Sabado/Linggo'' from 2004\u201306, 2004, and 2006, which was rearranged and composed by [[Neocolours]]'s Jimmy Antiporda.\n\nThe theme music from June 30, 2010 to present, which incorporates the elements of \"Pulstar\", ''TV Patrol''<nowiki/>'s 2001 theme, and ''TV Patrol World''<nowiki/>'s 2004 and 2006 theme music.\n\n==Anchors==\n[[File:TV Patroljf0191 07.JPG|thumb|Jasmine Romero and TV Patrol crew at Paco-Dilao Church]]\n\n===Weeknight anchors===\n* [[Noli de Castro]] <small>(main anchor, 1987\u20132001, 2010\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Bernadette Sembrano]] <small>(weekend anchor, 2005\u20132011;

All regional editions airs at about 5:00{{nbsp}}PM (right before the network's ''Primetime Bida'' evening block), with selected editions simulcast over [[The Filipino Channel]] for overseas viewers. Several newscasts were also aired nationwide from August 2016 to January 2018 on [[ABS-CBN Regional Channel]] via [[Sky Cable]], [[Destiny Cable]] and [[Sky Direct]]. The ABS-CBN News [[YouTube]] page also included archived videos of past editions since recently for those who have not watched the program as well as for overseas viewers.\n\nIn June 2018, the Regional division merged selected newscasts into super regions. The cutbacks initially left the Southern Luzon (Bicol, Southern Tagalog, Palawan), the Visayas (Panay, Negros, Central Visayas and Eastern Visayas), Chavacano and Southern Mindanao editions unchanged; standalone newscasts in North Central Luzon, Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, Caraga and Central Mindanao officially ended their telecasts on June 29, and were merged to their relevant control hubs in Baguio, Cagayan de Oro and General Santos from July 2. The merger was compensated by adding daily ''News Patrol'' bulletins in its respective super regions.\n\nThe Pampanga newscast was also axed after its June 29 edition; however, as [[DWIN-TV|TV-46 Pampanga]] was downgraded into a semi-satellite station for [[DWWX-TV|Channel 2 Manila]], the newscast was then scaled down as a short local ''News Patrol'' bulletin in July 2.<ref>[https://fromthetube.wordpress.com/2018/06/25/abs-cbn-regional-cancels-agri-tayo-dito-magtv-na/ ABS-CBN Regional cancels Agri Tayo Dito, MagTV na] accessed June 30, 2018</ref> News reports from there were later included, either as part of the North Luzon edition or integrated to the national newscast itself from August of the same year (Pampanga reports for the North Luzon edition were shelved one month later). The same ''News Patrol'' edition was eventually merged with the North Luzon edition itself, effective from May 20, 2019 (11 months after being axed), but was added a Kapampagan opt-out aired

The first is the delay between the [[index case|first case]] and the confirmation of the outbreak by the healthcare system, allayed by good surveillance via data collection, evaluation, and organisation.

The municipality has a population of {{formatnum: {{Infobox Finnish municipality/population count|Kuhmo}}}} ({{#time: j F Y|{{Infobox Finnish municipality/population count|sourcedate}} }})<ref name=\"population_count\" /> and covers an area of {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish municipality/total area|Kuhmo}}|km2}} of which {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish municipality/waters area|Kuhmo}}|km2|abbr=on}} is water.<ref name=\"total_area\" /> The [[population density]] is {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish municipality/population density|Kuhmo|round=2}}|PD/km2}}. It has a borderline of {{convert|120|km}} with [[Russia]] ([[Finnish-Russian border]]). Neighbour towns are [[Hyrynsalmi]], [[Lieksa]], [[Nurmes]], [[Ristij\u00e4rvi]], [[Sotkamo]] and [[Suomussalmi]]. A neighbour city across the Russian border is [[Kostomuksha]]. Vartius, one of the border crossing points between Finland and Russia, is located in northern Kuhmo.\n\nKuhmo\u00b4s eastern border is located at a drainage divider and town area belongs to [[drainage basin]] of [[Ouluj\u00e4rvi]].\n\nThe municipality is unilingually [[Finnish language|Finnish]].\n\n==History==\nThe first inhabitants arrived in Kuhmo after the last [[Weichselian glaciation|ice-age]], around 8000 BCE. Proof of Stone Age habitation has been found around [[Ontoj\u00e4rvi \u2013 Nurmesj\u00e4rvi|Ontoj\u00e4rvi]] and [[Lammasj\u00e4rvi]]. [[Sami people]] inhabited Kuhmo area until migration from [[Karelia]] and [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]] pushed Sami people up north. The influence of Sami culture is still found in the placenames. Wide spreading water routes are known to have attracted hunters, raiders, merchants and tax collectors since the 9th century.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of N\u00f6teborg]], the settlement between [[Sweden]] and the [[Novgorod Republic]] on August 12, 1323, the Kuhmo area belonged to Novgorod. Yet hunters and tax collectors kept on penetrating to the area from west. Swedish interest was to push the border further east.\n\nPermanent habitation settled to the area after [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav I]], king of Sweden, had promised tax relief to peasants who would move north. Almost all the habitation was destroyed in the Russo-Swedish war between 1570 and 1595. In the [[Treaty of Teusina]], the region of Kuhmo was annexed into Sweden. In the following centuries, this area was continuously raided in a number of wars and quarrels.\n\nIn 1809, Finland was annexed from Sweden to the Russian Empire as the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. For merchants from Karelia and Russia, Kuhmo became a trade route and a place to sell their goods. As a memorial of those merchants, on the market of Kuhmo there stands the statue \u201cLaukunkantaja\u201d (in English, \"The Bag Bearer\"). In this era, [[Elias L\u00f6nnrot]], compiler of the Finnish National Epic ''[[Kalevala]]'' made his poem-collecting trips via Kuhmo to Karelia. L\u00f6nnrot made some of the editing in Kuhmo. Reconstruction of the hut where he has staying can be seen in the Kalevala village. Publishing ''Kalevala'' in 1835 fueled birth of [[Karelianism]], which became a major trend in culture spheres towards the end of 19th century. [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]], who is considered as one of the founders of Karelianism, spent his honeymoon in Kuhmo. During their stay Gallen-Kallela painted some of his works at Lapinsalmi, lake [[Lentua]]. Scenery to lake Lentua based the background of the middle picture in his work [[Aino triptych]].\n\nDuring the 19th century [[Slash-and-burn|burn-beating]] was still essential in agriculture but in decline. At the end of 18th century [[tar]] production had arrived to the area as a new and steadily growing source of income. In the year 1900 tar production in Kuhmo was highest in Finland, at 1.6 million litres. Tar was shipped from Kuhmo to [[Oulu]] by [[rowboats]]. Largest boats could carry 25 \u2013 27 barrels, 125 litres each. Remains of tar pits, where tar was distilled from [[pine]], can be found everywhere in the Kuhmo area.\n\nThe [[Winter War]] is an important event in the history of Kuhmo. During the war Kuhmo was bombarded 48 times and ground battles took place as near as ten kilometers from the center of the town. The [[Soviet Army in World War II|Soviet army]]\u00b4s objective in Kuhmo was to proceed through Kuhmo and [[Kajaani]] to Oulu and divide Finland into two. The offensive was stopped on the Kuhmo \u2013 Saunaj\u00e4rvi road at Jyrk\u00e4nkoski and on the Kuhmo \u2013 Kiekinkoski road at Tyr\u00e4vaara, Both battlescenes are approximately 10&nbsp;km from the city center. At narrow Kuhmo (Saunaj\u00e4rvi road) the Soviet 54th Division was forced to spread its troops which made Finnish [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] tactics efficient. After being stopped, Soviet forces were divided and encircled into small [[Pocket (military)|pockets]]. A campaign to destroy the pockets and prevent the Soviet 44th Division from rescuing encircled forces continued until the [[Moscow Peace Treaty|Moscow peace treaty]].  After the war Kuhmo kept its eastern borderline unchanged, thus having an unchanged borderline for 400 years straight since the [[Treaty of Teusina]] of 1595.\n\n==Culture==\nKuhmo is well known for its [[Kuhmo Chamber Music Festival]] which is held annually. The festival was founded in 1970 by cellist Seppo Kimanen and a small group of friends. A book on this subject was published in 2006.<ref name=\"subrenat2006\">Listen, there's music from the forest: a short presentation of the Kuhmo Chamber Music Festival\", in English and French, by [[Jean-Jacques Subrenat]], {{ISBN|978-952-92-0564-6}}.</ref>\n\n==Geography and nature==\nBy area the municipality is the second largest in [[Kainuu|the region]] (and the twelfth largest in [[Finland|the country]]), covering twice the land area of [[Luxembourg]].   The population is heavily concentrated in Kuhmo-town.   Most of the area is very wild, featuring more than 600 lakes and for the rest extensively forested, providing a home to abundant wild life that includes [[bear]]s, [[wolves]] and [[Finnish forest reindeer]].\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has set Kuhmo as a part of Eastern Finland\u00b4s stable bear population area. According to the plan, the population density of bears in this area will be maintained higher than in the rest of the country. The wolf population is also dense by comparison to the rest of the country. In consequence, the number of reindeer has decreased lately.\n\nThe topography is made up of low hills, of which the most significant are near the [[Russia]]n frontier on the eastern side.   To the south, Kuhmo is bordered by [[North Karelia]].\n\nSeveral nature reserves have been founded in Kuhmo for the protection of the frontier wilderness.  [[Mets\u00e4hallitus|Forest administration]] maintains several hiking routes on the reserves and almost all are accessible to the public.\n\n==Sights==\n*Kuhmo Arts Centre\n*Kalevala

and is located at the south-eastern corner of the [[Kainuu]] [[regions of Finland|region]]. The municipality has a population of {{formatnum: {{Infobox Finnish municipality/population count|Kuhmo}}}} ({{#time: j F Y|{{Infobox Finnish municipality/population count|sourcedate}} }})<ref name=\"population_count\" /> and covers an area of {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish municipality/total area|Kuhmo}}|km2}} of which {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish municipality/waters area|Kuhmo}}|km2|abbr=on}} is water.<ref name=\"total_area\" /> The [[population density]] is {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish municipality/population density|Kuhmo|round=2}}|PD/km2}}. It has a borderline of {{convert|120|km}} with [[Russia]] ([[Finnish-Russian border]]). Neighbour towns are [[Hyrynsalmi]], [[Lieksa]], [[Nurmes]], [[Ristij\u00e4rvi]], [[Sotkamo]] and [[Suomussalmi]]. A neighbour city across the Russian border is [[Kostomuksha]]. Vartius, one of the border crossing points between Finland and Russia, is located in northern Kuhmo.\n\nKuhmo\u00b4s eastern border is located at a drainage divider and town area belongs to [[drainage basin]] of [[Ouluj\u00e4rvi]].\n\nThe municipality is unilingually [[Finnish language|Finnish]].\n\n==History==\nThe first inhabitants arrived in Kuhmo after the last [[Weichselian glaciation|ice-age]], around 8000 BCE. Proof of Stone Age habitation has been found around [[Ontoj\u00e4rvi \u2013 Nurmesj\u00e4rvi|Ontoj\u00e4rvi]] and [[Lammasj\u00e4rvi]]. [[Sami people]] inhabited Kuhmo area until migration from [[Karelia]] and [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]] pushed Sami people up north. The influence of Sami culture is still found in the placenames. Wide spreading water routes are known to have attracted hunters, raiders, merchants and tax collectors since the 9th century.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of N\u00f6teborg]], the settlement between [[Sweden]] and the [[Novgorod Republic]] on August 12, 1323, the Kuhmo area belonged to Novgorod. Yet hunters and tax collectors kept on penetrating to the area from west. Swedish interest was to push the border further east.\n\nPermanent habitation settled to the area after [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav I]], king of Sweden, had promised tax relief to peasants who would move north. Almost all the habitation was destroyed in the Russo-Swedish war between 1570 and 1595. In the [[Treaty of Teusina]], the region of Kuhmo was annexed into Sweden. In the following centuries, this area was continuously raided in a number of wars and quarrels.\n\nIn 1809, Finland was annexed from Sweden to the Russian Empire as the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. For merchants from Karelia and Russia, Kuhmo became a trade route and a place to sell their goods. As a memorial of those merchants, on the market of Kuhmo there stands the statue \u201cLaukunkantaja\u201d (in English, \"The Bag Bearer\"). In this era, [[Elias L\u00f6nnrot]], compiler of the Finnish National Epic ''[[Kalevala]]'' made his poem-collecting trips via Kuhmo to Karelia. L\u00f6nnrot made some of the editing in Kuhmo. Reconstruction of the hut where he has staying can be seen in the Kalevala village. Publishing ''Kalevala'' in 1835 fueled birth of [[Karelianism]], which became a major trend in culture spheres towards the end of 19th century. [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]], who is considered as one of the founders of Karelianism, spent his honeymoon in Kuhmo. During their stay Gallen-Kallela painted some of his works at Lapinsalmi, lake [[Lentua]]. Scenery to lake Lentua based the background of the middle picture in his work [[Aino triptych]].\n\nDuring the 19th century [[Slash-and-burn|burn-beating]] was still essential in agriculture but in decline. At the end of 18th century [[tar]] production had arrived to the area as a new and steadily growing source of income. In the year 1900 tar production in Kuhmo was highest in Finland, at 1.6 million litres. Tar was shipped from Kuhmo to [[Oulu]] by [[rowboats]]. Largest boats could carry 25 \u2013 27 barrels, 125 litres each. Remains of tar pits, where tar was distilled from [[pine]], can be found everywhere in the Kuhmo area.\n\nThe [[Winter War]] is an important event in the history of Kuhmo. During the war Kuhmo was bombarded 48 times and ground battles took place as near as ten kilometers from the center of the town. The [[Soviet Army in World War II|Soviet army]]\u00b4s objective in Kuhmo was to proceed through Kuhmo and [[Kajaani]] to Oulu and divide Finland into two. The offensive was stopped on the Kuhmo \u2013 Saunaj\u00e4rvi road at Jyrk\u00e4nkoski and on the Kuhmo \u2013 Kiekinkoski road at Tyr\u00e4vaara, Both battlescenes are approximately 10&nbsp;km from the city center. At narrow Kuhmo (Saunaj\u00e4rvi road) the Soviet 54th Division was forced to spread its troops which made Finnish [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] tactics efficient. After being stopped, Soviet forces were divided and encircled into small [[Pocket (military)|pockets]]. A campaign to destroy the pockets and prevent the Soviet 44th Division from rescuing encircled forces continued until the [[Moscow Peace Treaty|Moscow peace treaty]].  After the war Kuhmo kept its eastern borderline unchanged, thus having an unchanged borderline for 400 years straight since the [[Treaty of Teusina]] of 1595.\n\n==Culture==\nKuhmo is well known for its [[Kuhmo Chamber Music Festival]] which is held annually. The festival was founded in 1970 by cellist Seppo Kimanen and a small group of friends. A book on this subject was published in 2006.<ref name=\"subrenat2006\">Listen, there's music from the forest: a short presentation of the Kuhmo Chamber Music Festival\", in English and French, by [[Jean-Jacques Subrenat]], {{ISBN|978-952-92-0564-6}}.</ref>\n\n==Geography and nature==\nBy area the municipality is the second largest in [[Kainuu|the region]] (and the twelfth largest in [[Finland|the country]]), covering twice the land area of [[Luxembourg]].   The population is heavily concentrated in Kuhmo-town.   Most of the area is very wild, featuring more than 600 lakes and for the rest extensively forested, providing a home to abundant wild life that includes [[bear]]s, [[wolves]] and [[Finnish forest reindeer]].\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has set Kuhmo as a part of Eastern Finland\u00b4s stable bear population area. According to the plan, the population density of bears in this area will be maintained higher than in the rest of the country. The wolf population is also dense by comparison to the rest of the country. In consequence, the number of reindeer has decreased lately.\n\nThe topography is made up of low hills, of which the most significant are near the [[Russia]]n frontier on the eastern side.   To the south, Kuhmo is bordered by [[North Karelia]].\n\nSeveral nature reserves have been founded in Kuhmo for the protection of the frontier wilderness.  [[Mets\u00e4hallitus|Forest administration]] maintains several hiking routes on the reserves and almost all are accessible to the public.\n\n==Sights==\n*Kuhmo Arts Centre\n*Kalevala Village\n*Juminkeko \u2013 The Information Center for the Kalevala and Karelian Culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juminkeko.fi/en/ |title=Juminkeko \u2013 The Information Center for the Kalevala and Karelian Culture |publisher=Juminkeko.fi |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>\n*[[Petola Visitor Centre]]\n\n==International relations==\n{{Main|List of twin towns and sister cities in Finland}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2014 Sister cities===\nKuhmo is [[town twinning|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|Russia}} [[Kostamus]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Oroszl\u00e1ny]], Hungary\n*{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Robertsfors]], Sweden\n*{{flagicon|Slovakia}} [[\u0160a\u013ea]], Slovakia\n\n==The Districts and Villages of the Town of Kuhmo==\n{|\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n'''Districts:''' \n* Akonlahti\n* Hankaranta\n* Jaurakko\n* Kalevala\n* Kanninlampi\n* Kantola\n* Keitaala\n* Kontio\n* Korkeam\u00e4ki\n* Kuhmoniemi\n* Lev\u00e4lahti\n* Pajakka\n* Piilola\n* Saarikoski\n* Sormula\n* Suvanto\n| valign=\"top\" | || valign=\"top\" | \n'''Villages:'''\n* Haukela\n* Hietaper\u00e4\n* H\u00e4rm\u00e4nkyl\u00e4\n* Hukkaj\u00e4rvi\n* Iivantiira\n* Jonkeri\n* Juonto\n* Juttua\n* Jyrkk\u00e4\n* J\u00e4m\u00e4s\n* Kalliojoki\n* Katerma\n* Kattilakoski\n* Kiekinkoski\n* Kivikiekki\n* Korpisalmi\n| valign=\"top\" | || valign=\"top\" |\n'''Villages:''' (cont'd)\n* Kuumu\n* Kuusamonkyl\u00e4\n* Lammasper\u00e4\n* Lauvuskyl\u00e4\n* Lentiira\n* Lentua\n* Niemiskyl\u00e4\n* Niva\n* Saunaj\u00e4rvi\n* Timoniemi\n* Rasti\n* Seilonen\n* Sylv\u00e4j\u00e4\n* Vartius\n* Veps\u00e4\n* Vieksi\n| valign=\"top\" | || valign=\"top\" |\n'''Villages:''' (cont'd)\n* Viiksimo\n* Vuosanka\n* Ypykk\u00e4vaara\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{commonscat-inline|Kuhmo}}\n*{{Official website|URL=http://www.kuhmo.fi/index.asp?language=2 }}\n*[http://www.kuhmolaiset.fi/ Official Internet forum of Kuhmo]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081208202121/http://www.kuhmofestival.fi/indexen.htm Kuhmo Chamber Music Festival]\n*[http://www.kuhmonet.fi/ Lots of other links and information about Kuhmo's services.]\n\n{{Kainuu}}\n\n[[Category:Kuhmo| ]]\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Finland]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Kainuu]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1865]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhmo"}
