From the 16th century to 18th century, the [[Kingdom of France]] claimed ownership of large parts of [[North America]].  In 1762, after the [[French and Indian War]], France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]].\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.  In 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]].\n\nIn 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized, then in 1861 [[Kansas]] became the 34th [[U.S. state]].  In 1867, '''Reno County''' was established.\n\nIn 1887, the [[Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway]] extended its main line from [[Herington, Kansas|Herington]] to [[Pratt, Kansas|Pratt]].<ref name=\"Rock Island Rail History\">[http://home.covad.net/~scicoatnsew/rihist4.htm Rock Island Rail History]</ref>  This main line connected Herington, [[Ramona, Kansas|Ramona]], [[Tampa, Kansas|Tampa]], [[Durham, Kansas|Durham]], [[Waldeck, Kansas|Waldeck]], [[Canton, Kansas|Canton]], [[Galva, Kansas|Galva]], [[McPherson, Kansas|McPherson]], [[Groveland, Kansas|Groveland]], [[Inman, Kansas|Inman]], [[Medora, Kansas|Medora]], [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], [[Whiteside, Kansas|Whiteside]], [[Partridge, Kansas|Partridge]], [[Arlington, Kansas|Arlington]],  [[Langdon, Kansas|Langdon]], [[Turon, Kansas|Turon]], [[Preston, Kansas|Preston]], [[Natrona, Kansas|Natrona]], [[Pratt, Kansas|Pratt]].

For example, many believe the world class Library to be a socialising area, THIS IS FALSE. This common propagandic, horseshit misconception is nothing but lies feed to you by the (((5G Enthusiasts))). This abhorrent misconception led to the untimely death of our beloved Librarian (add Pic Here). May she rest In Peace. \n\nAnother tale of controversy, was the beheading of a student, live in front of the others, this was done by maths teacher Mr Addison, he did this in order to establish dominance over everyone else there. However, one hero arose from the crowd, namely Mary \"Optic Burgess\" Burgess.  The ensuing battle was immense, greater than anything I can possibly put into words, it is literally impossible for me to articulate what went down. Tears befall me, just thinking about how immense was.  I cite the only use of nuclear weapons in history solely because I want you to understand just how intense this battle was, furthermore those bombings don't even begin to scratch the surface of what was the single most impactful event in all of human history. PERIOD. Mary (our lady) proceeded to kick the living shit out of Mr Addison, after that, she rescued the boy from being beheaded, haha just kidding. The guillotine had already fell, and the boy split into to, with his soul leaving his corpse. Now this story seems to have a happy ending, however, what I haven't told you is that this battle between Optic Burgess and Mr Addison lead to the destruction of the school, and lead to lots of children and staff being flung thousands of feet into the air and vaporised from the sheer power of Our Lady. Some of these corpses have fell to the ground, with the most recent one being found falling from the skies of Siberia. Noone lost their job, and the school was rebuilt in a day by slave labour and Phineas and Ferb.\n\n==History==\nPreviously a [[voluntary aided school]] administered by [[Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council]], Cardinal Hume Catholic School converted to [[Academy (English school)|academy status]] on 1 February 2012.
