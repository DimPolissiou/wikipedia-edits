It is generally considered the midpoint between the cities of [[San Francisco]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} from the city center of both cities, approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} from the city center of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], less than {{convert|19|mi|km}} from [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]], {{convert|16|mi|km}} from the [[Carquinez Bridge]], and {{convert|14|mi|km}} from the [[Benicia Bridge]]. Fairfield was founded in 1856 by [[clipper]]ship [[Robert Waterman (sea captain)|captain Robert H. Waterman]], and named after his former hometown of [[Fairfield, Connecticut]].\n\nIt is the home of [[Travis Air Force Base]] and the headquarters of [[Jelly Belly]].  With a population of 108,321 at the 2010 census, it is slightly smaller in population than [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]]. Other nearby cities include [[Suisun City, California|Suisun City]], [[Vacaville, California|Vacaville]], [[Rio Vista, California|Rio Vista]], [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], and [[Napa, California|Napa]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|37.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|34.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|3.2|sqmi|km2}} of it is water. The total area is 5.65% water.\n\nThe city is located within the California Coastal Ranges. The city is centered directly north of the [[Suisun Bay]] and northeast of the [[San Pablo Bay]]. Much of the Suisun Bay contains the [[Suisun Marsh]], the largest saltwater marsh on the west coast of the United States.\n\nThe city includes one hospital <B>NorthBay Medical Center</B>, a 154-bed advanced medical facility that also features a level II Trauma Center.\n\n==History==\nAccording to the City of Fairfield website,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.fairfield.ca.us/about/history/default.asp |title=About Fairfield |access-date=January 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230074905/http://www.ci.fairfield.ca.us/about/history/default.asp |archive-date=December 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Native Americans, such as those from the Ion culture, settled in the Rockville and Green Valley areas. Artifacts that have been found from some of the earliest human inhabitants of the Fairfield area are dated to be around five to six thousand years old, making them some of the oldest Native American settlements in Northern California. \n \nThe first European contact came in 1810 when the Spanish army was ordered to attack the [[Suisunes|Suisun Indians]]. In 1835 the Mexican [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo|General Vallejo]] was so magnanimous in victory over the Indian Chief Sem Yeto that the chief later became his ally in conflicts against other tribes. In 1837 the [[Chief Solano|Indian Chief Solano]] received the [[Rancho Suisun]] Mexican land grant. This grant eventually came into the hands of a clipper ship captain from [[Fairfield, Connecticut]] named [[Robert Waterman (sea captain)|Robert H. Waterman]]. He not only parceled out the town in 1856, but also, in a commercially shrewd move, entered Fairfield in the race for Solano County seat in 1858, and won it from [[Benicia, California|Benicia]]. As an inducement he granted {{convert|16|acre|ha}} of land for the construction of county buildings. In 1903 Fairfield was incorporated as a city.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 329\n|1880= 424\n|1910= 834\n|1920= 1008\n|1930= 1131\n|1940= 1312\n|1950= 3118\n|1960= 14968\n|1970= 44146\n|1980= 58099\n|1990= 77211\n|2000= 96178\n|2010= 105321\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=116884\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archive-date=April 26, 2015|df=mdy}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0623182|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Fairfield city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Fairfield had a population of 105,322.

It is generally considered the midpoint between the cities of [[San Francisco]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} from the city center of both cities, approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} from the city center of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], less than {{convert|19|mi|km}} from [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]], {{convert|16|mi|km}} from the [[Carquinez Bridge]], and {{convert|14|mi|km}} from the [[Benicia Bridge]]. Fairfield was founded in 1856 by [[clipper]]ship [[Robert Waterman (sea captain)|captain Robert H. Waterman]], and named after his former hometown of [[Fairfield, Connecticut]].\n\nIt is the home of [[Travis Air Force Base]] and the headquarters of [[Jelly Belly]].  With a population of 108,321 at the 2010 census, it is slightly smaller in population than [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]]. Other nearby cities include [[Suisun City, California|Suisun City]], [[Vacaville, California|Vacaville]], [[Rio Vista, California|Rio Vista]], [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], and [[Napa, California|Napa]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|37.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|34.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|3.2|sqmi|km2}} of it is water. The total area is 5.65% water.\n\nThe city is located within the California Coastal Ranges. The city is centered directly north of the [[Suisun Bay]] and northeast of the [[San Pablo Bay]]. Much of the Suisun Bay contains the [[Suisun Marsh]], the largest saltwater marsh on the west coast of the United States.\n\nThe city includes one hospital <B>NorthBay Medical Center</B>, a 154-bed advanced medical facility that also features a level II Trauma Center.\n\n==History==\nAccording to the City of Fairfield website,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.fairfield.ca.us/about/history/default.asp |title=About Fairfield |access-date=January 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230074905/http://www.ci.fairfield.ca.us/about/history/default.asp |archive-date=December 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Native Americans, such as those from the Ion culture, settled in the Rockville and Green Valley areas. Artifacts that have been found from some of the earliest human inhabitants of the Fairfield area are dated to be around five to six thousand years old, making them some of the oldest Native American settlements in Northern California. \n \nThe first European contact came in 1810 when the Spanish army was ordered to attack the [[Suisunes|Suisun Indians]]. In 1835 the Mexican [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo|General Vallejo]] was so magnanimous in victory over the Indian Chief Sem Yeto that the chief later became his ally in conflicts against other tribes. In 1837 the [[Chief Solano|Indian Chief Solano]] received the [[Rancho Suisun]] Mexican land grant. This grant eventually came into the hands of a clipper ship captain from [[Fairfield, Connecticut]] named [[Robert Waterman (sea captain)|Robert H. Waterman]]. He not only parceled out the town in 1856, but also, in a commercially shrewd move, entered Fairfield in the race for Solano County seat in 1858, and won it from [[Benicia, California|Benicia]]. As an inducement he granted {{convert|16|acre|ha}} of land for the construction of county buildings. In 1903 Fairfield was incorporated as a city.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 329\n|1880= 424\n|1910= 834\n|1920= 1008\n|1930= 1131\n|1940= 1312\n|1950= 3118\n|1960= 14968\n|1970= 44146\n|1980= 58099\n|1990= 77211\n|2000= 96178\n|2010= 105321\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=116884\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archive-date=April 26, 2015|df=mdy}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0623182|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Fairfield city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Fairfield had a population of 105,322.

Most of his notable work was accomplished at a young age, in the years 1886 through 1897. He is also associated with [[Cloisonnism]] and [[Synthetism]], two late 19th-century [[art movements]]. Less known is Bernard's literary work, comprising plays, poetry, and art criticism as well as art historical statements that contain first-hand information on the crucial period of [[modern art]] to which Bernard had contributed.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Lautrecx07.jpg|thumb|right|<center>''\u00c9mile Bernard''<br>by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] (1886)</center>]]\n{{For|a timeline|\u00c9mile Bernard chronology}}\n\u00c9mile Henri Bernard was born in Lille, France in 1868. As in his younger years his sister was sick, \u00c9mile was unable to receive much attention from his parents; he therefore stayed with his grandmother, who owned a laundry in Lille, employing more than twenty people. She was one of the greatest supporters of his art. The family moved to Paris in 1878, where \u00c9mile attended the ''Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe.''\n\n===Education===\n\nHe began his studies at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des arts d\u00e9coratifs|\u00c9cole des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]]. In 1884, joined the [[Atelier Cormon]] where he experimented with [[impressionism]] and [[pointillism]] and befriended fellow artists [[Louis Anquetin]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. After being suspended from the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts for \"showing expressive tendencies in his paintings\", he toured [[Brittany]] on foot, where he was enamored by the tradition and landscape.\n\nIn August 1886, Bernard met Gauguin in [[Pont-Aven]]. In this brief meeting, they exchanged little about art, but looked forward to meeting again. Bernard said, looking back on that time, that \"my own talent was already fully developed.\" He believed that his style did play a considerable part in the development of Gauguin's mature style.\n\n===1887\u20131888===\n\nBernard spent September 1887 at the coast, where he painted ''La Grandm\u00e8re'', a portrait of his grandmother. He continued talking with other painters and started saying good things about Gauguin. Bernard went back to Paris, attended [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]], <ref>Russell, John. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D61E30F93AA25750C0A96F948260 \"An Art School That Also Taught Life,\"] ''New York Times.'' 19 March 1989</ref>  met wth van Gogh, who was impressed by his work, found a restaurant to show the work alongside van Gogh, Anquetin, and Toulouse-Lautrec's work at the Avenue Clichy. Van Gogh called the group the School of Petit-Boulevard.\n\nOne year later, Bernard set out for Pont-Aven by foot and saw Gauguin. Their friendship and artistic relationship grew strong quickly. By this time Bernard had developed many theories about his artwork and what he wanted it to be. He stated that he had \"a desire to [find] an art that would be of the most extreme simplicity and that would be accessible to all, so as not to practice its individuality, but collectively...\" Gauguin was impressed by Bernard's ability to verbalize his ideas.\n\n1888 was a seminal year in the history of [[Modern art]]. From 23 October until 23 December [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]] worked together in [[Arles]]. Gauguin had brought his new style from [[Pont-Aven]] exemplified in ''[[Vision After the Sermon|Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel]]'', a powerful work of visual symbolism of which he had already sent a sketch to van Gogh in September.\n<gallery perrow=5>\nFile:\u00c9mile Bernard 1888 - Self-portrait with Gauguin portrait for Vincent.jpeg|''Self-portrait with portrait of Paul&nbsp;Gauguin'', Bernard,&nbsp;1888.\nFile:Paul Gauguin 112.jpg|Gauguin's counterpiece, same&nbsp;year, for&nbsp;same&nbsp;'Vincent'.\nFile:\u00c9mile Bernard 1888-08 - Breton Women in the Meadow (Le Pardon de Pont-Aven).jpg|''Breton Women in a Green Pasture'', Bernard,&nbsp;1888.\nFile:Breton Women.jpg|Van Gogh's copy, December&nbsp;1888.\nFile:Paul Gauguin 137.jpg|''[[Vision After the Sermon|Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel]]'', Gauguin,&nbsp;1888.\n</gallery>\nHe also brought along Bernard's ''Le Pardon de Pont-Aven'' which he had exchanged for one of his paintings and which he used to decorate the shared workshop.\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/07/26/badorment26.xml&sSheet=/arts/2005/07/26/ixartright.html see in:] (ref. Druick 2001) This work was equally striking and illustrative of the style \u00c9mile Bernard had already acquainted van Gogh with when he sent him a batch of drawings in August, so much so that van Gogh made a [[watercolor]] copy of the ''Pardon'' (December 1888) which he sent to his [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|brother]], to recommend Bernard's new style to be promoted. The following year van Gogh still vividly remembered the painting in his written portrait of \u00c9mile Bernard in a letter to his sister Wil (10 December 1889):\"...it was so original I absolutely wanted to have a copy.\"\n\nBernard's style was effective and coherent (see:[http://www.ackland.org/tours/classes/bernard.html woman at haystacks],) as can also be seen from the comparison of the two \"portraits\" Bernard and Gauguin sent to van Gogh at the end of September 1888 at the latter's request: self-portraits -at Gauguin's initiative- each integrating a small portrait of the other in the background. (ref. Druick 2001)\n\nOne of \u00c9mile Bernard's drawings from the August batch (\"...a lane of trees near the sea with two women talking in the foreground and some strollers\" \u2013 Vincent van Gogh in a letter to Bernard \u2013 Arles 1888) also appears to have inspired the work van Gogh and Gauguin did on the All\u00e9e des [[Alyscamps]] in Arles.\n\nIn 1891 he joined a group of [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] painters that included Odilon Redon and Ferdinand Hodler.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} In 1893 he started traveling, to Egypt, Spain and Italy and after that his style became more [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]]. He returned to Paris in 1904 and remained there for the remainder of his life. He taught at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] before he died in 1941.\n\n::\"[...] this creative, [[avant-garde]] young man destroyed himself in a fight against that same avant-garde he had helped to create. His rivalry with Gauguin led him out of spite along a different path: classicism. This change took place when he was living in the Middle East, in a period of great crisis. But the fact remains that the young Bernard played an essential part as an initiator for Gauguin, and that he was the inventor of a new artistic vision.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n==Theories on style and art: Cloisonnism and Symbolism==\n[[File:Affiche Volpini.jpg|thumb|Poster of the 1889 Exhibition of Paintings by the [[Impressionist]] and [[Synthetism|Synthetist Group]], at Caf\u00e9 des Arts, known as [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889]].]]\nBernard theorized a style of painting with bold forms separated by dark contours which became known as [[cloisonnism]]. His work showed geometric tendencies which hinted at influences of [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], and he collaborated with [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]].\n\nMany say that it was Bernard's friend Anquetin, who should receive the credit for this \"closisonisme\" technique. During the spring of 1887, Bernard and Anquetin \"turned against Neo-Impressionism.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} It is also likely that Bernard was influenced by the works he had seen of C\u00e9zanne. But Bernard says \"When I was in Brittany, I was inspired by \"everything that is superfluous in a spectacle is covering it with reality and occupying our eyes instead of our mind. You have to simplify the spectacle in order to make some sense of it. You have, in a way, to draw its plan.\" {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n\"The first means that I use is to simplify nature to an extreme point. I reduce the lines only to the main contrasts and I reduce the colors to the seven fundamental colors of the prism. To see a style and not an item. To highlight the abstract sense and not the objective.\nAnd the second means were to appeal to the conception and to the memory by extracting yourself from any direct atmosphere. Appeal more to internal memory and conception. There I was expressing myself more, it was me that I was describing, although I was in front of the nature. There was an invisible meaning under the mute shape of exteriority.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nSymbolism and religious motifs appear in both Bernard and Gauguin's work. During the summer of 1889, Bernard was alone in Le Pouldu and began to paint many religious canvasses. He was upset that he had to do commercial work at the same time that he wanted to create these pieces.\nBernard wrote about his relationship with the style of symbolism in many letters, articles, and statements. He said that it was of a Christian essence, divine language. Bernard believed that it \"It is the invisible express by the visible,\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} and those previous attempts of religious symbolism failed. That period of symbolism represented the nature of beauty, but did not find the truth in the beauty. Art until the renaissance was based on the invisible rather than the visible, the idea, not the shapes or concrete. The history of the painting of symbols was spiritual. Everything, meaning symbols, were forgotten with the paganist ideas and doctrines. That is what Bernard was attempting to accomplish with the rebirth of symbolism in 1890. In his idea of the new symbolism, he concentrated on maintaining a grounded art, more authentic in Bernard's mind meant reducing impressionism, not creating an optical trip like [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]], but simplifying the actual symbol.\n\nHis concept was that through ideas, not technique, the truth is found.\n\n==Influence==\nIt was always \u00c9mile Bernard's great frustration that Paul Gauguin never mentioned him as an influence on pictorial symbolism (see for instance his own notes attached to the Belgian edition (1942) of his selected letters, published shortly after his death). In 2001/2002 [[The Art Institute of Chicago]] and the [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam held a joint exhibition:[http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/vangogh/slide_intro.html Van Gogh and Gauguin:The Workshop of the South] that put \u00c9mile Bernard's contribution in perspective. (ref. Druick 2001)\n\nOne of \u00c9mile Bernard's students was the Swedish painter [[Ivan Agu\u00e9li]].\n\n==Works==\n<Gallery>\nFile:Bernard-ArbreJaune-Rennes.JPG|''Yellow Tree'', 1888.\nFile:\u00c9mile Bernard Brothel Scene for Vincent 1888.jpg|''Brothel&nbsp;scene, sent+dedicated to&nbsp;Vincent&nbsp;van&nbsp;Gogh'', 1888.\nFile:Roubaix Emile Bernard garcon.JPG|\u00c9mile Bernard, ''Portrait of a Boy in Hat'', 1889.\nFile:\u00c9mile Bernard - Still life with teapot, cup and fruit - Google Art Project.jpg| ''Still life with teapot, cup and fruit'', 1890.\nFile:Emile Bernard, Breton Peasants in a Meadow, 1892.jpg|''Breton Peasants in a Meadow'', 1892.\n</Gallery>\n\n==Writings==\n\n===Art criticism===\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* ''{{lang|fr|Au Palais des Beaux-Arts.

Most of his notable work was accomplished at a young age, in the years 1886 through 1897. He is also associated with [[Cloisonnism]] and [[Synthetism]], two late 19th-century [[art movements]]. Less known is Bernard's literary work, comprising plays, poetry, and art criticism as well as art historical statements that contain first-hand information on the crucial period of [[modern art]] to which Bernard had contributed.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Lautrecx07.jpg|thumb|right|<center>''\u00c9mile Bernard''<br>by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] (1886)</center>]]\n{{For|a timeline|\u00c9mile Bernard chronology}}\n\u00c9mile Henri Bernard was born in Lille, France in 1868. As in his younger years his sister was sick, \u00c9mile was unable to receive much attention from his parents; he therefore stayed with his grandmother, who owned a laundry in Lille, employing more than twenty people. She was one of the greatest supporters of his art. The family moved to Paris in 1878, where \u00c9mile attended the ''Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe.''\n\n===Education===\n\nHe began his studies at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des arts d\u00e9coratifs|\u00c9cole des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]]. In 1884, joined the [[Atelier Cormon]] where he experimented with [[impressionism]] and [[pointillism]] and befriended fellow artists [[Louis Anquetin]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. After being suspended from the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts for \"showing expressive tendencies in his paintings\", he toured [[Brittany]] on foot, where he was enamored by the tradition and landscape.\n\nIn August 1886, Bernard met Gauguin in [[Pont-Aven]]. In this brief meeting, they exchanged little about art, but looked forward to meeting again. Bernard said, looking back on that time, that \"my own talent was already fully developed.\" He believed that his style did play a considerable part in the development of Gauguin's mature style.\n\n===1887\u20131888===\n\nBernard spent September 1887 at the coast, where he painted ''La Grandm\u00e8re'', a portrait of his grandmother. He continued talking with other painters and started saying good things about Gauguin. Bernard went back to Paris, attended [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]], <ref>Russell, John. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D61E30F93AA25750C0A96F948260 \"An Art School That Also Taught Life,\"] ''New York Times.'' 19 March 1989</ref>  met with van Gogh, who as we already stated was impressed by his work, found a restaurant to show the work alongside van Gogh, Anquetin, and Toulouse-Lautrec's work at the Avenue Clichy. Van Gogh called the group the School of Petit-Boulevard.\n\nOne year later, Bernard set out for Pont-Aven by foot and saw Gauguin. Their friendship and artistic relationship grew strong quickly. By this time Bernard had developed many theories about his artwork and what he wanted it to be. He stated that he had \"a desire to [find] an art that would be of the most extreme simplicity and that would be accessible to all, so as not to practice its individuality, but collectively...\" Gauguin was impressed by Bernard's ability to verbalize his ideas.\n\n1888 was a seminal year in the history of [[Modern art]]. From 23 October until 23 December [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]] worked together in [[Arles]]. Gauguin had brought his new style from [[Pont-Aven]] exemplified in ''[[Vision After the Sermon|Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel]]'', a powerful work of visual symbolism of which he had already sent a sketch to van Gogh in September.\n<gallery perrow=5>\nFile:\u00c9mile Bernard 1888 - Self-portrait with Gauguin portrait for Vincent.jpeg|''Self-portrait with portrait of Paul&nbsp;Gauguin'', Bernard,&nbsp;1888.\nFile:Paul Gauguin 112.jpg|Gauguin's counterpiece, same&nbsp;year, for&nbsp;same&nbsp;'Vincent'.\nFile:\u00c9mile Bernard 1888-08 - Breton Women in the Meadow (Le Pardon de Pont-Aven).jpg|''Breton Women in a Green Pasture'', Bernard,&nbsp;1888.\nFile:Breton Women.jpg|Van Gogh's copy, December&nbsp;1888.\nFile:Paul Gauguin 137.jpg|''[[Vision After the Sermon|Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel]]'', Gauguin,&nbsp;1888.\n</gallery>\nHe also brought along Bernard's ''Le Pardon de Pont-Aven'' which he had exchanged for one of his paintings and which he used to decorate the shared workshop.\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/07/26/badorment26.xml&sSheet=/arts/2005/07/26/ixartright.html see in:] (ref. Druick 2001) This work was equally striking and illustrative of the style \u00c9mile Bernard had already acquainted van Gogh with when he sent him a batch of drawings in August, so much so that van Gogh made a [[watercolor]] copy of the ''Pardon'' (December 1888) which he sent to his [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|brother]], to recommend Bernard's new style to be promoted. The following year van Gogh still vividly remembered the painting in his written portrait of \u00c9mile Bernard in a letter to his sister Wil (10 December 1889):\"...it was so original I absolutely wanted to have a copy.\"\n\nBernard's style was effective and coherent (see:[http://www.ackland.org/tours/classes/bernard.html woman at haystacks],) as can also be seen from the comparison of the two \"portraits\" Bernard and Gauguin sent to van Gogh at the end of September 1888 at the latter's request: self-portraits -at Gauguin's initiative- each integrating a small portrait of the other in the background. (ref. Druick 2001)\n\nOne of \u00c9mile Bernard's drawings from the August batch (\"...a lane of trees near the sea with two women talking in the foreground and some strollers\" \u2013 Vincent van Gogh in a letter to Bernard \u2013 Arles 1888) also appears to have inspired the work van Gogh and Gauguin did on the All\u00e9e des [[Alyscamps]] in Arles.\n\nIn 1891 he joined a group of [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] painters that included Odilon Redon and Ferdinand Hodler.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} In 1893 he started traveling, to Egypt, Spain and Italy and after that his style became more [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]]. He returned to Paris in 1904 and remained there for the remainder of his life. He taught at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] before he died in 1941.\n\n::\"[...] this creative, [[avant-garde]] young man destroyed himself in a fight against that same avant-garde he had helped to create. His rivalry with Gauguin led him out of spite along a different path: classicism. This change took place when he was living in the Middle East, in a period of great crisis. But the fact remains that the young Bernard played an essential part as an initiator for Gauguin, and that he was the inventor of a new artistic vision.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n==Theories on style and art: Cloisonnism and Symbolism==\n[[File:Affiche Volpini.jpg|thumb|Poster of the 1889 Exhibition of Paintings by the [[Impressionist]] and [[Synthetism|Synthetist Group]], at Caf\u00e9 des Arts, known as [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889]].]]\nBernard theorized a style of painting with bold forms separated by dark contours which became known as [[cloisonnism]]. His work showed geometric tendencies which hinted at influences of [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], and he collaborated with [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]].\n\nMany say that it was Bernard's friend Anquetin, who should receive the credit for this \"closisonisme\" technique. During the spring of 1887, Bernard and Anquetin \"turned against Neo-Impressionism.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} It is also likely that Bernard was influenced by the works he had seen of C\u00e9zanne. But Bernard says \"When I was in Brittany, I was inspired by \"everything that is superfluous in a spectacle is covering it with reality and occupying our eyes instead of our mind. You have to simplify the spectacle in order to make some sense of it. You have, in a way, to draw its plan.\" {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n\"The first means that I use is to simplify nature to an extreme point. I reduce the lines only to the main contrasts and I reduce the colors to the seven fundamental colors of the prism. To see a style and not an item. To highlight the abstract sense and not the objective.\nAnd the second means were to appeal to the conception and to the memory by extracting yourself from any direct atmosphere. Appeal more to internal memory and conception. There I was expressing myself more, it was me that I was describing, although I was in front of the nature. There was an invisible meaning under the mute shape of exteriority.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nSymbolism and religious motifs appear in both Bernard and Gauguin's work. During the summer of 1889, Bernard was alone in Le Pouldu and began to paint many religious canvasses. He was upset that he had to do commercial work at the same time that he wanted to create these pieces.\nBernard wrote about his relationship with the style of symbolism in many letters, articles, and statements. He said that it was of a Christian essence, divine language. Bernard believed that it \"It is the invisible express by the visible,\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} and those previous attempts of religious symbolism failed. That period of symbolism represented the nature of beauty, but did not find the truth in the beauty. Art until the renaissance was based on the invisible rather than the visible, the idea, not the shapes or concrete. The history of the painting of symbols was spiritual. Everything, meaning symbols, were forgotten with the paganist ideas and doctrines. That is what Bernard was attempting to accomplish with the rebirth of symbolism in 1890. In his idea of the new symbolism, he concentrated on maintaining a grounded art, more authentic in Bernard's mind meant reducing impressionism, not creating an optical trip like [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]], but simplifying the actual symbol.\n\nHis concept was that through ideas, not technique, the truth is found.\n\n==Influence==\nIt was always \u00c9mile Bernard's great frustration that Paul Gauguin never mentioned him as an influence on pictorial symbolism (see for instance his own notes attached to the Belgian edition (1942) of his selected letters, published shortly after his death). In 2001/2002 [[The Art Institute of Chicago]] and the [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam held a joint exhibition:[http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/vangogh/slide_intro.html Van Gogh and Gauguin:The Workshop of the South] that put \u00c9mile Bernard's contribution in perspective. (ref. Druick 2001)\n\nOne of \u00c9mile Bernard's students was the Swedish painter [[Ivan Agu\u00e9li]].\n\n==Works==\n<Gallery>\nFile:Bernard-ArbreJaune-Rennes.JPG|''Yellow Tree'', 1888.\nFile:\u00c9mile Bernard Brothel Scene for Vincent 1888.jpg|''Brothel&nbsp;scene, sent+dedicated to&nbsp;Vincent&nbsp;van&nbsp;Gogh'', 1888.\nFile:Roubaix Emile Bernard garcon.JPG|\u00c9mile Bernard, ''Portrait of a Boy in Hat'', 1889.\nFile:\u00c9mile Bernard - Still life with teapot, cup and fruit - Google Art Project.jpg| ''Still life with teapot, cup and fruit'', 1890.\nFile:Emile Bernard, Breton Peasants in a Meadow, 1892.jpg|''Breton Peasants in a Meadow'', 1892.\n</Gallery>\n\n==Writings==\n\n===Art criticism===\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* ''{{lang|fr|Au Palais des Beaux-Arts.

He played a key role in the [[Nazi]] ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' in January 1933 when, under pressure from advisers, he appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] Chancellor of Germany.\n\nBorn to a family of minor Prussian nobility, Hindenburg joined the Prussian army in 1866 where he saw combat during the [[Austro-Prussian War|Austro-Prussian]] and [[Franco-Prussian War|Franco-Prussian]] wars. He retired with the rank of [[General of the Infantry]] in 1911, but was recalled to military service at the age of 66 following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914 and shortly thereafter received nationwide attention as the victor of the [[Battle of Tannenberg]].

As [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] increasingly delegated his authority to the [[Oberste Heeresleitung|Army High Command]], Hindenburg and his deputy, General [[Erich Ludendorff]], established a ''de facto'' military dictatorship that controlled Germany for the rest of the war.\n\nHindenburg retired again in 1919, but returned to public life in 1925 to be [[1925 German presidential election|elected]] the second President of Germany. He defeated Hitler in a runoff to [[1932 German presidential election|win reelection]] in 1932. He was opposed to Hitler and was a major player in the increasing political instability in the Weimar Republic that ended with Hitler's rise to power. He dissolved the Reichstag twice in 1932 and finally agreed to appoint Hitler [[Chancellor of Germany]] in January 1933. Hindenburg did this to satisfy Hitler's demands that he should play a part in the Weimar government, for Hitler was the leader of the [[Nazi party]], which had won a plurality in the November 1932 elections. In February he approved the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], which suspended various civil liberties, and in March signed the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], which gave Hitler's regime arbitrary powers. Hindenburg died the following year, after which Hitler declared himself ''[[F\u00fchrer|F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler]]'', or Supreme Leader and Chancellor, which superseded both the Presidency and Chancellorship.\n\n==Early life==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}<!--most unreferenced-->\n[[File:Wahlstatt Damals \u2013 PvH.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Paul von Hindenburg as a cadet in [[Wahlstatt]] (1860)]]\n[[File:Wapen von Benneckendorf und Hindenburg.svg|thumb|left|Coat of arms of the [[Uradel|ancient]] {{ill|von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg (noble family)|lt=von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg family|de|von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg}}]]\nPaul Ludwig Hans Anton von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg was born in Posen, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (Polish: [[Pozna\u0144]]; until [[Second Partition of Poland|1793]] and since [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918\u20131919)|1919]] part of [[Poland]]<ref>[http://mapa.szukacz.pl/?x=359424&y=506422&m=Pozna%f1&u=Podg%f3rna&w=wielkopolskie&p=Pozna%f1&g=Pozna%f1&z=0 Mapa.szukacz.pl \u2013 Mapa Polski z planami miast<!-- bot-generated title -->] at mapa.szukacz.pl</ref>), the son of [[Prussia]]n aristocrat Hans Robert Ludwig von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg (1816\u20131902) and his wife Luise Schwickart (1825\u20131893), the daughter of physician Karl Ludwig Schwickart and wife Julie Moennich.

He was promoted to captain in 1878 and assigned to the staff of the Second Army Corps. He married the intelligent and accomplished [[Gertrud von Hindenburg|Gertrud von Sperling (1860\u20131921)]] by whom he had two daughters, Irmengard Pauline (1880) and Annemaria (1891) and one son, [[Oskar von Hindenburg|Oskar]] (1883).

His section was led by Count [[Alfred von Schlieffen]], a noted student of [[encirclement]] battles like [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], whose famous [[Schlieffen Plan]] proposed to pocket the French Army. For five years Hindenburg also taught tactics at the ''Kriegsakademie''. At the maneuvers of 1885, he met the future [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]]; they met again at the next year's war game in which Hindenburg commanded the \"[[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]]\". He learned the topography of the lakes and sand barrens of East Prussia during the annual Great General Staff's ride in 1888. The following year he moved to the War Ministry, to write the field service regulations on [[Military engineering|field-engineering]] and on the use of heavy artillery in field engagements; both were used during the First World War. He became a lieutenant-colonel in 1891, and two years later was promoted to colonel commanding an infantry regiment.

Nevertheless, urged on by Ludendorff and Hoffman, Hindenburg spent the winter fighting for his strategy by badgering the Kaiser while his press officer recruited notables like the [[Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein|''Kaiserin'']] and the [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince]] to \u201cstab the kaiser in the back\u201d.<ref>M\u00fcller, 1961, p. 57.</ref> The kaiser compromised by keeping Falkenhayn in supreme command, but replacing him as Prussian war minister. In retaliation, Falkenhayn reassigned some of Hindenburg's forces to a new army group under [[Prince Leopold of Bavaria]] and transferring Ludendorff to a new joint German and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Southern Army. Hindenburg and Ludendorff reacted by threatening to resign thereby resulting in Ludendorff's reinstatement under Hindenburg's command.\n\n====Counterattacks in East Prussia & Poland====\n[[File:Von Hindenburg and his staff 1914.jpg|thumb|Hindenburg and his staff in 1914]]\n\nFollowing his return, Ludendorff provided Hindenburg with a depressing evaluation of their allies\u2019 army, which already had lost many of their professional officers<ref>Ludendorff, 1919, '''1''' pp. 134\u201338.</ref> and had been driven out of much of the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], their part of what once had been [[Partitions of Poland|Poland]]. Meanwhile, the Russians were inexorably pushing from Galicia toward Hungary through the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] passes. Under orders from Falkenhayn to contain the resurgent Russians, Hindenburg mounted an unsuccessful attack in Poland with his Ninth Army as well as an offensive by his newly formed [[10th Army (German Empire)|Tenth Army]] which made only local gains. Following these setbacks, he set up temporary headquarters at [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]], and made plans to eliminate the Russians' remaining toehold in East Prussia by ensnaring them in a [[pincer movement]] between the Tenth Army in the north and Eighth Army in the south. The attack was launched on 7 February whereby Hindenburg's forces encircled an entire corps and captured more than 100,000 men in the [[Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes]].\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian fortress city of [[Przemy\u015bl Fortress|Przemy\u015bl]] in Galicia, which had been [[Siege of Przemy\u015bl|besieged]] for months, surrendered on 23 March with the loss of 117,000 men. To drive the Russians out of the Carpathian passes the Austro-Hungarians proposed a joint strike on the Russian right flank. Falkenhayn agreed, so he moved ''OHL'' east to the castle of [[Pszczyna|Pless]] and formed Army Group [[August von Mackensen|von Mackensen]] from a new German [[11th Army (German Empire)|Eleventh Army]] and the Austro-Hungarian [[4th Army (Austria-Hungary)|Fourth Army]].

For weeks he continued to steamroller forward, his entire front stepping forward shoulder to shoulder eastward across Galicia, his guns smashing through hastily constructed Russian lines. Hindenburg was to pressure the Russians in the north. He moved headquarters to [[Gi\u017cycko|L\u00f6tzen]], near the eastern boundary of East Prussia. Three cavalry divisions swept east into [[Courland]], the barren, sandy region near the Baltic coast, in one of the war's most successful cavalry actions. The cavalry's gains were held by Hindenburg's new [[Neman (river)|Nieman]] army, named after the river.\n\nIn June ''OHL'' ordered Hindenburg to attack frontally in Poland north of [[Warsaw]], steamrollering toward the [[Narew]] River. Ludendorff, furious with dictated tactics and because they were prohibited from pressing on in [[Courland]], sat on his hands.<ref>Hindenburg, 1921, '''1''', p. 174.</ref> Hindenburg created [[Army Group Gallwitz (1918)|Army Group Gallwitz]]{{mdash}}named after its commander{{mdash}}which when Berlin approved became [[12th Army (German Empire)|Twelfth Army]] (Von [[Max von Gallwitz|Gallwitz]] is one of many able commanders selected by Hindenburg), who stayed at the new army's headquarters to be available if needed.

On 5 August his forces were consolidated into Army Group Hindenburg, which took the city of [[Grodno]] after bitter street fighting, but the retreating defenders could not be trapped because the wretched rail lines lacked the capacity to bring up the needed men. They occupied [[Vilnus]] on 18 September, then halted on ground favorable for a defensive line.\n\nOn 7 October Austro-Hungarian and German troops in Army Group Mackensen [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|invaded]] [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], capturing [[Belgrade]], and then eastern Serbia was invaded by the [[Bulgaria during World War I|Bulgarians]], who were promised substantial territorial gains; they had fine men but had lost many officers in the [[Balkan Wars]]. Falkenhayn had rejected advice that the Bulgarians should attack further south, to try to encircle the Serbs. By 4 December the remaining Serbian troops had escaped into [[Albania during World War I|Albania]].\n\nIn October Hindenburg moved headquarters to Kovno. They were responsible for 108,800&nbsp;km{{sup|2}} (42,000&nbsp;mi{{sup|2}}) of conquered Russian territory, which was home to three million people and became known as ''[[Ober Ost]]''. The troops built fortifications on the eastern border while Ludendorff \u201cwith his ruthless energy\u201d<ref>Hindenburg, 1921, '''1''', p. 182.</ref> headed the civil government, using forced labor to repair the war damages and to dispatch useful products, like hogs, to Germany.

In nine days they captured more than 200,000 men and 200 guns, and pushed into open country. Austro-Hungarian troops were rushed back from the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. Every man was needed in the west, so German troops on the Eastern Front had to be shifted south to plug the gap. Then on 19 June the Russians struck further north near [[Kovel]] on a front of {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} defended by Austro-Hungarian and German troops, beginning with a bombardment from 1,000 guns. ''Ober Ost'' desperately shored up weak points with defenders stripped from less threatened positions. Ludendorff was so distraught on the phone to ''OHL'' that General [[Wilhelm Groener]] (who directed the army's railroads and had been a competitor with Ludendorff on the General Staff) was sent to evaluate his nerves, which were judged satisfactory.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Asprey|first1=Robert|title=The German High Command at War: Hindenburg and Ludendorff conduct World War I|url=https://archive.org/details/germanhighcomman00aspr|url-access=registration|date=1991|publisher=William Morrow|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/germanhighcomman00aspr/page/188 188]}}</ref> For a week the Russians kept attacking: they lost 80,000 men; the defenders 16,000. On 16 July the Russians attacked the German lines west of Riga, where again they were thwarted by a stout defense.\n\n====Commander of the Eastern Front====\nOn 27 July the Austro-Hungarians accepted Hindenburg as the commander of the Eastern Front (except for the Archdukes Karl's Army Group in southeast Galicia, in which the German [[Hans von Seeckt]] was chief of staff). General von Eichhorn took over Army Group Hindenburg, while Hindenburg and Ludendorff, on a staff train equipped with the most advanced communication apparatus, visited their new forces. At threatened points they formed mixed German and Austro-Hungarian units and other Austro-Hungarian formations were bolstered by a sprinkling of German officers. The derelict citadel of the [[Brest Fortress]] was refurbished as their headquarters. Their front was almost {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} and their only reserves were a cavalry brigade plus some artillery and machine gunners.<ref>Ludendorff, '''1''', 1919, p. 275.</ref> The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] sent a corps to reinforce the German Southern Army, which had to hold Galicia because it was a major source of petroleum. The Russians then struck on Brusilov's right with their best troops, the [[Russian Guards|Guards Army]], and the heaviest artillery concentration yet seen on the Eastern Front. Their military maps were sketchy, because they had never planned to fight so deep in their own territory, so the Guards were sent to advance through a swamp; in a week they lost 80 percent of their men. Further south Brusilov did better, penetrating a few kilometers into Hungary, but when the front stabilized the Russians faced new fortifications dug and wired on the German pattern. Officers were exchanged between the German and Austro-Hungarian armies for training.\n\n====Supreme commander====\n[[File:Vogel drawing.jpg|thumb|left|Hindenburg drawn by his friend Hugo Vogel|upright=0.8]]\n\nIn the west, the Germans were hemorrhaging in the battles of [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] and the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]]. Influential ''OHL'' officers, led by the artillery expert Lieutenant Colonel [[Max Bauer]], a friend of Ludendorff's, lobbied against Falkenhayn, deploring his futile steamroller at Verdun and his inflexible defense along the Somme, where he packed troops into the front-line to be battered by the hail of shells and sacked commanders who lost their front-line trench. German leaders contrasted Falkenhayn's bludgeon with Hindenburg's deft parrying.<ref>M\u00fcller, 1961, p. 109.</ref>\nThe tipping point came after Falkenhayn ordered a Bulgarian spoiling attack on the Entente lines in [[Macedonian front|Macedonia]], which failed with heavy losses. Thus emboldened, [[Romania during World War I|Romania]] declared war against Austro-Hungary on 27 August, adding 650,000 trained enemies who invaded Hungarian [[Transylvania]]. Falkenhayn had been adamant that Romania would remain neutral. During the Kaiser's deliberations about who should command Falkenhayn said \u201cWell, if the Herr Field Marshall has the desire and the courage to take the post\u201d. Hindenburg replied \u201cThe desire, no, but the courage\u2014yes\u201d.<ref>M\u00fcller, 1961, p. 188.</ref> Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg favored Hindenburg, supposing him amenable to moderate peace terms,<ref>M\u00fcller, 1961, p. 187.</ref> mistaking his amiability as tractability and unaware that he was intent on enlarging Prussia.\n\nHindenburg was summoned to Pless on 29 August where he was named Chief of the General Staff. Ludendorff demanded joint responsibility for all decisions\u201d;<ref>Ludendorff 1919, '''1''', p. 283.</ref> Hindenburg did not demur. Henceforth, Ludendorff became the public face of ''OHL'': signing most orders, directives and the daily press reports. The eastern front was commanded by Leopold of Bavaria, with Hoffmann as his chief of staff. Hindenburg was also appointed as Supreme War Commander of the armies of the Central Powers, with nominal control of six million men. The British were unimpressed: General Charteris, Haig's intelligence chief, wrote to his wife \u201cpoor old Hindenburg is sixty-four years of age, and will not do very much.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beach|first1=Jim|title=Haig's intelligence.

Both crown princes, with Prussian chiefs of staff, commanded Army Groups. Rupprecht and Albrecht were presented with field marshal's batons. Hindenburg told them that they must stand on the defensive until Romania was dealt with, meanwhile defensive tactics must be improved {{mdash}} ideas were welcome.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kronprinz Rupprecht von Bayern|title=Mein Kriegstagbuch|date=1919|publisher=Deutscher National Verlag U.

The Entente supported Romania by attacking from [[Macedonian front|Macedonia]], but were repelled. Mackensen seized the Romanian forts on the right bank of the Danube, while infantry and cavalry from the Western Front reinforced the Ninth Army in Hungarian [[Transylvania]], which now was commanded by [[Erich von Falkenhayn|Falkenhayn]] (another of Hindenburg's prudent selections). In a month, he defeated the Romanian invaders at [[Sibiu|Hermannstadt]] and then in November thrust into Romania through passes in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], while Mackensen crossed the Danube to cut off their retreat, but the Romanians moved swiftly, they and their Russian reinforcements formed a defensive line in [[Moldavia|Moldova]] after Bucharest fell on 6 December 1916. [[John Norton-Griffiths|British saboteurs]] had time enough to burn the oil stores and to plug most of the wells. During the last months of the year the Russians continued vain assaults in Ukraine. In 1916 there were three Russian casualties on the Eastern Front for every two from the Central Powers and Russian morale was crumbling: \u201cMore than a dozen Russian regiments mutinied in the last weeks of 1916.\u201d<ref>Lincoln, 1986, p. 259.</ref> About 12% of the German casualties that year were on the Eastern Front. In the autumn, the Entente began to push the Bulgarians back in Macedonia. On 11 October Army Group Otto von Below was formed there from the Bulgarians, twenty German battalions and an Ottoman corps; their new line held.\n\n====Bolstering defense====\n''OHL'' issued a Textbook of Defensive Warfare that recommended fewer defenders in the front line relying on light machine guns, if pushed too hard they were permitted to pull back. Attackers who penetrated the front line entered a battle zone, in which they were machine gunned from scattered emplacements and shelled by the German artillery, who knew the ranges and location of their own strong points. Then infantry counterattacked, while the attacker's artillery was blind because they were unsure where their own men were. A reserve division was positioned immediately behind the line, if it entered the battle it was commanded by the division whose position had been penetrated. (Mobile defense was also used in World War II.) Responsibilities were reassigned to implement the new tactics: front-line commanders took over reserves ordered into the battle and for flexibility infantry platoons were subdivided into eight man units under a noncom.\n\nField officers who visited headquarters often were invited to speak with Hindenburg, who inquired about their problems and recommendations. At this time he was especially curious about the eight man units,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Papen|first1=Franz von|title=Memoirs|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirs0000pape|url-access=registration|date=1952|publisher=A.

A monthly periodical informed artillery officers about new developments. In the last months of 1916 the British battering along the Somme produced fewer German casualties. Overall, \u201cIn a fierce and obstinate conflict on the Somme, which lasted five months, the enemy pressed us back to a depth of about six miles on a stretch of nearly twenty-five miles\u201d<ref>Hindenburg, 1921, '''2''', p. 32.</ref> Thirteen new divisions were created by reducing the number of men in infantry battalions, and divisions now had an artillery commander.

Nivelle was given command of the French Army.\n\n====Headquarters routine====\nHindenburg's day at ''OHL'' began at 09:00 when he and Ludendorff discussed the reports {{mdash}} usually quickly agreeing on what was to be done.<ref>Hindenburg, 1921, '''1''', pp. 227\u201332.</ref> Ludendorff would give their staff of about 40 officers their assignments, while Hindenburg walked for an hour or so, thinking or chatting with guests. After conferring again with Ludendorff, he heard reports from his departmental heads, met with visitors and worked on correspondence. At noon Ludendorff gave the situation report to the kaiser, unless an important decision was required when Hindenburg took over. He lunched with his personal staff, which included a son-in-law who was an Army officer.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} Dinner at 20:00 was with the general staff officers of all ranks and guests {{mdash}} crowned heads, allied leaders, politicians, industrialists and scientists. They left the table to subdivide into informal chatting groups.<ref>Hindenburg, 1921, '''1''', pp. 234\u201335.</ref> At 21:30 Ludendorff announced that time was up and they returned to work. After a junior officer summarized the daily reports, he might confer with Ludendorff again before retiring.\n\n====The Hindenburg program====\nLudendorff and Bauer, who knew all the industrialists, set ambitious goals for arms production, in what was called the [[Hindenburg Programme]], which was directed from the War Office by General Groener. Major goals included a new light machine gun, updated artillery, and motor transport, but no tanks because they considered them too vulnerable to artillery. To increase output they needed skilled workers. The army released a million men.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=John|title=The warlords : Hindenburg and Ludendorff|date=2005|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|page=105}}</ref> For total war, ''OHL'' wanted all German men and women from 15 to 60 enrolled for national service. Hindenburg also wanted the universities closed, except for medical training, so that empty places would not be filled by women. To swell the next generation of soldiers he wanted contraceptives banned and bachelors taxed.<ref>Asprey, 1991, p. 340.</ref> When a Polish army was being formed he wanted Jews excluded.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kitchen|first1=Martin|title=The Silent Dictatorship.

At the funeral Hindenburg met his successor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles]], who was frank about hoping to stop fighting. Hindenburg's Eastern Front ran south from the Baltic to the Black Sea through what now are the Baltic States, Ukraine, and Romania. In Italy, the line ran from the Swiss border on the west to the Adriatic east of Venice. The Macedonian front extended along the Greek border from the Adriatic to the Aegean. The line contested by the Russians and Ottomans between the Black and [[Caspian Sea]] ran along the heights of the [[Caucasus]] mountains. He urged the Ottomans to pull their men off the heights before winter, but they did not, he believed this was because of their \"policy of massacre of the Armenians\"<ref>Hindenburg, 1921,'''2''', p. 16.</ref> and many froze. The front in Palestine ran from the Mediterranean to the southern end of the Dead Sea, and the defenders of [[Mesopotamian campaign|Baghdad]] had a flank on the Tigris River. The Western Front ran southward from Belgium until near Laon, where it turned east to pass Verdun before again turning south to end at the Swiss Border. The remaining German enclaves in [[East African Campaign (World War I)|Africa]] were beyond his reach; an attempt to resupply them by [[LZ 104 (L 59)|dirigible]] failed. The Central Powers were surrounded and outnumbered.\n\n===1917===\n[[File:Hindenburg and ludendorff.jpg|thumb|Hindenburg and Ludendorff|upright=0.9]]\n\n====Submarine warfare====\nStrengthening their army would take time: by the second quarter of 1917 the field army would have 680,000 more men in 53 new divisions<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reichsarkive|title=Der Weltkrieg 1914 bis 1918|date=1942|publisher=Mittler|location=Berlin|volume=13}}</ref> and the supply of the new [[MG 08|light machine guns]] would be adequate. Field guns would have increased from 5,300 to 6,700 and heavies from 3,700 to 4,340. They tried to foster fighting spirit by 'patriotic instruction\u2019 with lectures and films<ref>Kitchen, 1976, p. 58.</ref> to \u201censure that a fight is kept up against all agitators, croakers and weaklings\u201d.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Binding|first1=Rudolf|title=A fatalist at war|date=1929|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|page=183}}</ref> Meanwhile, they were sure to be attacked before their buildup was complete. In the interim the pressure might be reduced if the [[Imperial German Navy|Navy]] waged [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], which they claimed would defeat the British in six months. The chancellor and his camp were opposed, not wanting to bring the United States and other neutrals into the war. After securing the Dutch and Danish borders, Hindenburg announced that unrestricted submarine warfare was imperative and Ludendorff added his voice. On 9 January the chancellor bowed to their unsound military judgments: underrating the United States and overrating their own navy.\n\n''OHL'' moved west to the pleasant spa town of [[Bad Kreuznach]] in southwest Germany, which was on a main rail line. The Kaiser's quarters were in the spa building, staff offices were in the orange court, and the others lived in the hotel buildings. In February a third Army Group was formed on the Western Front to cover the front in Alsace-Lorraine, it was commanded by Archduke Albrecht of W\u00fcrttemberg. Some effective divisions from the east were exchanged for less competent divisions from the west. Since their disasters of the previous year the Russian infantry had shown no fight and in March the [[February Revolution|revolution]] erupted in Russia. Shunning opportunity, the Central Powers stayed put {{mdash}} Hindenburg feared that invaders would resurrect the heroic resistance of [[French invasion of Russia|1812]].\n\n====The great withdrawal and defending the Western Front====\nOn the Western Front their huge salient between the valley of the Somme and Laon obviously was vulnerable to a pincer attack, which indeed the French were planning. The new Hindenburg line ran across its base. On 16 March they began [[Operation Alberich]]: moving out able-bodied inhabitants and portable possessions, destroying every building, all roads and bridges, cutting down every tree, fouling every well, and burning every combustible. In 39 days the Germans withdrew from a 1000&nbsp;mi\u00b2 (2,590&nbsp;km\u00b2) area, more ground than they had lost to all Allied offensives since 1914.<ref>Herwig, 1997, p. 252.</ref> The cautiously following Allies also had to cope with booby traps, some exploding a month later. The new front was {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}} shorter freeing-up 14 German divisions.\n\nOn 9 April the British attacked. At [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras]] led by tanks and a creeping barrage, they took the German first and second lines and occupied part of their third while the Canadians swept the Germans completely off the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge.]]. There was consternation at ''OHL'', their new defense had failed. It was Ludendorff's birthday but he refused to come to the celebratory dinner. Hindenburg \u201cpressed the hand of my First Quartermaster-General with the words, \u2018We have lived through more critical times than to-day together\u2019\u201d<ref>Hindenburg, '''2''', p. 58.</ref> The British tried to exploit their opening with a futile cavalry charge but did not press further, because their attack was a diversion for coming French operations. In fact, their new defensive tactics had not been tested, because Sixth Army commander [[Ludwig von Falkenhausen]] had packed men in the front line and kept counterattack divisions too far back. He was replaced.\n\nA week later the anticipated French [[Nivelle Offensive|offensive]] began, driving northward from the [[Second Battle of the Aisne|Aisne River]], after six days of intensive shelling their infantry was led forward by 128 tanks, the first attack by massed tanks.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=David|title=Breaking point of the French army : the Nivelle offensive of 1917|date=2015|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|location=Barnsley}}</ref> [[Robert Nivelle|Nivelle]] knew that the Germans had captured his detailed plans several weeks before, but followed them nonetheless. The first two German lines were taken at heavy cost and the French slowly advanced {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} as the defense fell back to their main line of resistance {{mdash}} it was far from Nivelle's promise of a first day's advance of {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The attacks ended in early May when many French regiments refused to attack. The Germans never learned the extent of their enemy's [[French Army Mutinies|demoralization]]. Nivelle was replaced by P\u00e9tain.\n\n====The Ottoman and Eastern Fronts====\nThe British captured Baghdad on 11 March. The Ottomans had been promised that their empire would be defended, so all their troops in Europe returned home and in May Falkenhayn was appointed to command Army group F comprising two Ottoman armies along with three German infantry battalions with some artillery; to impress the enemy it was called The Asiatic Corps. Falkenhayn realized it would be difficult to retake Baghdad, so he took over the defense of the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Gaza line]] in Palestine, which the British broke through in November. To spare the city ''OHL'' ordered him not to defend Jerusalem, which was occupied in December.\n\nThe revolutionary Russian government led by [[Alexander Kerensky]] remained at war, [[Kerensky Offensive|attacking]] and pushing back the Austro-Hungarians in Galicia on 1 July. To counter this success, on 18 July after a [[hurricane bombardment]] by 136 batteries directed by Bruchm\u00fcller a ''Schwerpunkt'' of six German divisions from the west broke a gap in the Russian front, through which they sliced southward toward [[Ternopil|Tarnopol]], thereby threatening to pocket the Russian attackers, who fled to save themselves; many of the demoralized Russian units elected committees to replaced their officers. At the end of August the advancing Central Powers stopped at the frontier of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]]. To keep up the pressure and to seize ground he intended to keep, Hindenburg shifted north to the heavily fortified city of Riga (today in Latvia) which has the broad [[Daugava|Dvina River]] as a moat. On 1 September the Eighth Army, led by [[Oskar von Hutier]], attacked; Bruchm\u00fcller's bombardment, which included gas and smoke shells, drove the defenders from the far bank east of the city, the Germans crossed in barges and then bridged the river, immediately pressing forward to the Baltic coast, pocketing the defenders of the [[Battle of Jugla|Riga salient]]. Next a joint operation with the navy seized [[Saaremaa|Oesel]] and two smaller islands in the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga|Gulf of Riga]]. The [[October Revolution|Bolshevik revolution]] took Russia out of the war, an armistice was signed on 16 December.\n\n====The Reichstag peace resolution====\n[[File:H & K.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiser Wilhelm II and Hindenburg|upright=0.8]]\n\nHindenburg detested Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg for dragging his feet about total and submarine warfare. Then in July the chancellor permitted the Reichstag to debate a [[Reichstag Peace Resolution|resolution]] for peace without \u201cannexations or indemnities\u201d. Colonel Bauer and the Crown Prince rushed to Berlin to block this peril. The minister of war urged Hindenburg and Ludendorff to join them, but when they arrived the kaiser told them that \u201cthere could be no justification for their presence in Berlin\u201d. They should \u201creturn in haste to Headquarters where they certainly would be much better occupied.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=De Gaulle|first1=Charles|title=The Enemy's House Divided|url=https://archive.org/details/enemyshousedivid00gaul|url-access=registration|date=2002|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=[https://archive.org/details/enemyshousedivid00gaul/page/103 103\u201304]}}</ref> They returned as ordered and then immediately telegraphed their resignations, which the kaiser declined. The crisis was resolved when the monarchist parties voted no confidence in Bethmann-Hollweg, who resigned. Ludendorff and Bauer wanted to replace both the kaiser and chancellor by a dictator, but Hindenburg would not agree.<ref>Bauer, 1922, p. 159.</ref> Many historians believe that in fact Ludendorff assumed that role.{{citation needed, clarify}} The Reichstag passed a modified resolution calling for \u201cconciliation\u201d on 19 July, which the new chancellor [[Georg Michaelis]] agreed to \"interpret\".\n\nThe resolution became advantageous in August when the Pope called for peace. The German response cited the resolution to finesse specific questions like those about the future of Belgium. The industrialists opposed Groener's advocacy of an excess profits tax and insistence that workers take a part in company management.<ref>Kitchen, 1976, p. 144.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Chickering|first1=Roger|title=Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914\u20131918|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialgermany00roge|url-access=registration|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=[https://archive.org/details/imperialgermany00roge/page/81 81]}}</ref> Ludendorff relieved Groener by telegram and sent him off to command a division.\n\nHindenburg's 70th birthday was celebrated lavishly all over Germany, 2 October was a public holiday, an honor that until then had been reserved only for the Kaiser.<ref>Astore and Showalter, 2005, p. 51.</ref> Hindenburg published a birthday manifesto, which ended with the words:\n{{quote|With God's help our German strength has withstood the tremendous attack of our enemies, because we were one, because each gave his all gladly. So it must stay to the end. \u2018Now thank we all our God\u2019 on the bloody battlefield! Take no thought for what is to be after the war! This only brings despondency into our ranks and strengthens the hopes of the enemy. Trust that Germany will achieve what she needs to stand there safe for all time, trust that the German oak will be given air and light for its free growth. Muscles tensed, nerves steeled, eyes front! We see before us the aim: Germany honored, free and great! God will be with us to the end!\"<ref>Astore and Showalter, 2005, pp. 51\u201352.</ref>}}\n\n====Victory in Italy====\nBavarian mountain warfare expert [[Konrad Krafft von Dellmensingen|von Dellmensingen]] was sent to assess the Austro-Hungarian defenses in Italy, which he found poor. Then he scouted for a site from which an attack could be mounted against the Italians. Hindenburg created a new Fourteenth Army with ten Austro-Hungarian and seven German divisions and enough airplanes to control the air, commanded by [[Otto von Below]]. The attackers slipped undetected into the mountains opposite to the opening of the [[So\u010da]] valley. The [[Battle of Caporetto|attack]] began during the night when the defender's trenches in the valley were abruptly shrouded in a dense cloud of poison gas released from 894 canisters fired simultaneously from simple mortars. The defenders fled before their masks would fail. The artillery opened fire several hours later, hitting the Italian reinforcements hastening up to fill the gap. The attackers swept over the almost empty defenses and marched through the pass, while mountain troops cleared the heights on either side. The Italians fled west, too fast to be cut off. Entente divisions were rushed to Italy to stem the retreat by holding a line on the Piave River. Below's Army was dissolved and the German divisions returned to the Western Front, where in October P\u00e9tain had directed a successful limited objective attack in which six days of carefully planned bombardment left crater-free pathways for 68 tanks to lead the infantry forward on the Lassaux plateau south of Laon, which forced the Germans off of the entire ridge {{mdash}} the French Army had recovered.\n\n====The treaty with Russia====\nIn the negotiations with the Soviet Government, Hindenburg wanted to retain control of all Russian territory that the Central Powers occupied, with German grand dukes ruling [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)|Courland]] and [[Kingdom of Lithuania (1918)|Lithuania]], as well as a large slice of [[Kingdom of Poland (1917\u20131918)|Poland]]. Their Polish plan was opposed by Foreign Minister [[Richard von K\u00fchlmann]], who encouraged the kaiser to listen to the views of Max Hoffmann, chief of staff on the Eastern Front. Hoffmann demurred but when ordered argued that it would be a mistake bring so many Slavs into Germany, when only a small slice of Poland was needed to improve defenses. Ludendorff was outraged that the kaiser had consulted a subordinate, while Hindenburg complained that the kaiser \u201cdisregards our opinion in a matter of vital importance.\u201d<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, 1967, p. 131.</ref> The kaiser backed off, but would not approve Ludendorff's order removing Hoffmann, who is not even mentioned in Hindenburg's memoir. When the Soviets refused the terms offered at [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] the Germans repudiated the armistice and in a week [[Operation Faustschlag|occupied]] the Baltic States, [[Belarus]] and Ukraine, which had signed the treaty as a separate entity. Now the Russians signed also. Hindenburg helped to force K\u00fchlmann out in July 1918.\n\n===1918===\nIn January more than half a million workers went on strike, among their demands was a peace without annexations. The strike collapsed when its leaders were arrested, the labor press suppressed, strikers in the reserve called for active duty, and seven great industrial concerns were taken under military control, which put their workers under martial law.<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, 1967, p. 142.</ref> On 16 January Hindenburg demanded the replacement of Count von Valentini, the chief of the Civil Cabinet.

Hundreds of thousands of men were needed to hold and police these conquests. More Germans were in Macedonia and in Palestine, where the British were driving north; Falkenhayn was replaced by [[Otto Liman von Sanders]], who had led the defense of [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. All Hindenburg required was that these fronts stand firm while the Germans won in the west, where now they outnumbered their opponents. He firmly believed that his opponents could be crushed by battlefield defeats regardless of their far superior resources.\n\nOffensive tactics were tailored to the defense. Their opponents were adopting defense in depth. He would attack the British because they were less skillful than the French.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sixsmith|first1=Major General E. K.

However, winter mud prevented action there until April. Consequently, their first attack, named Michael, was on the southern part of the British line, at a projecting British salient near Saint-Quentin. ''Schwerpunkts'' would hit on either side of the salient's apex to pocket its defenders, the V Corps, as an overwhelming display of German power.\n\nAdditional troops and skilled commanders, like von Hutier, were shifted from the east, Army Group von Gallwitz was formed in the west on 1 February. One quarter of the western divisions were designated for attack; to counter the elastic defense during the winter each of them attended a four-week course on infiltration tactics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Historical Section, General Staff|title=A survey of German Tactics 1918|date=1918|publisher=The Base Printing Plant. 29th Engineers, U.

As always surprise was essential, so the artillery was slipped into attack positions at night, relying on camouflage for concealment; the British aerial photographers were allowed free rein before D-day. There would be no preliminary registration fire, the gunners were trained for map firing in schools established by Bruchm\u00fcller. In the short, intense bombardment each gun fired in a precise sequence, shifting back and forth between different targets, using many gas shells to keep defenders immersed in a toxic cloud. On D-day, the air force would establish air supremacy and machine gun enemy strong points, also updating commanders on how far the attackers had penetrated. Signal lamps were used for messaging on the ground. Headquarters moved close to the front and as soon as possible would advance to pre-selected positions in newly occupied ground. ''OHL'' moved to [[Spa, Belgium]] while Hindenburg and Ludendorff were closer to the attack at [[Avesnes-l\u00e8s-Bapaume|Avesnes, France]], which re-awoke his memories of occupied France 41 years before.<ref>Hindenburg, 1921, '''2''', p. 153.</ref>\n\n====Breaking the trench stalemate====\n[[Operation Michael]] struck on 21 March. The first day's reports were inconclusive, but by day two they knew they had broken through some of the enemy artillery lines. But the encirclement failed because British stoutness gave V Corps time to slip out of the targeted salient. On day four they were moving on into open country when the kaiser prematurely celebrated by pinning the [[iron cross]] with sun's rays on Hindenburg's tunic, the first recipient since the medal was created for [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|von Bl\u00fccher]].<ref>Wheeller-Bennett, 1936, p. 149.</ref> As usual Hindenburg set objectives as the situation evolved. South of the salient they had almost destroyed the British Fifth Army, so they pushed west to cut between the French and British Armies, but did not succeed because they advanced too slowly through the thrashed terrain of the former Somme battlefields and the ground devastated when withdrawing the year before and because troops stopped to loot food and clothing {{mdash}} hence they never broke through the Entente's fluid defensive line, manned by troops brought up and supplied by rail and motor transport. Then he hoped to get close enough to [[Amiens]] to bombard the railways with heavy artillery {{mdash}} they were stopped just short, after having advanced a maximum of {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Hindenburg also hoped that civilian morale would crumble because Paris was being shelled from by [[Paris Gun|naval guns]] mounted on rail carriages {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}} away, but he underestimated French resiliency.\n\nThe Allied command was dismayed. French headquarters realized: \"This much became clear from the terrible adventure, that our enemies were masters of a new method of warfare. ... What was even more serious was that it was perceived that the enemy's power was due to a thing that cannot be improvised, the training of officers and men.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=de Pierrefeu|first1=Jean|title=French Headquarters 1915\u20131918|url=https://archive.org/details/frenchheadquarte00pieruoft|date=1924|publisher=Geoffrey Bles|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/frenchheadquarte00pieruoft/page/247 247]|translator=Major C.

Again they broke through, smashing the Portuguese defenders and forcing the British from all of the ground they had paid so dearly for in 1917. However, French support enabled the British to save [[Hazebrouck]], the rail junction that was the German goal. To draw the French reserves away from Flanders, the next attack was along the [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Aisne River]] where Nivelle had attacked the year before. Their success was dazzling. The defender's front was immersed in a gas cloud fired from simple mortars,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zabecki|first1=David T.|title=The German 1918 Offensives : A case study in the operational level of war|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=209}}</ref> within hours they had reoccupied all the ground the French had taken by weeks of grinding, and they continued to sweep south through Champagne until they halted for resupply at the [[Marne (river)|Marne River]].\n\nHindenburg had lost 977,555 of his best men between March and the end of July, while their foe's ranks were swelling with Americans. His dwindling stock of horses were on the verge of starvation and his ragged men thought continually of food. One of the most effective propaganda handbills the British showered on the German lines listed the rations received by prisoners of war. His troops bridled at their officer's rations and reports of the ample meals at headquarters, in his memoirs Ludendorff devotes six pages to defending officer's rations and perks.<ref>Ludendorff, 1919, pp. 286\u201392.</ref> After an attack the survivors needed at least six weeks to recuperate, but now crack divisions were recommitted much sooner. Tens of thousands of men were skulking behind the lines. Determined to win, he decided to expand the salient pointing toward Paris to strip more defenders from Flanders. The attack on [[Henri Gouraud (general)|General Henri Gouraud's]] French Fourth Army followed the now familiar scenario but was met by a deceptive elastic defense and was decisively repelled at the French main line of resistance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gudmundsson|first1=Bruce I.|title=On artillery|date=1993|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|pages=95\u2013102}}</ref> Hindenburg still intended to try the conclusive strike in Flanders, but before he could strike French and Americans led by light tanks smashed through the right flank of the German salient on the [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Marne]]. The German defense was halfhearted.They had lost. Hindenburg went on the defensive, withdrawing one by one from the salients created by their victories, evacuating their wounded and supplies and retiring to shortened lines. He hoped to hold a line until their enemies were ready to bargain.\n\n====Ludendorff's breakdown====\n[[File:Hindenburg and Ludendorff.jpg|thumb|Hindenburg and Ludendorff in 1918]]\nSince their retreat from the Marne, Ludendorff had been distraught, shrieking orders and often in tears. At dinner on 19 July he responded to a suggestion of Hindenburg's by shouting \"I have already told you that is impossible\u201d {{mdash}} Hindenburg led him from the room.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parkinson|first1=Roger|title=Tormented warrior, Ludendorff and the supreme Command|url=https://archive.org/details/tormentedwarrior0000park|url-access=registration|date=1978|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/tormentedwarrior0000park/page/167 167]}}</ref> On 8 August the British completely surprised them with a well-coordinated attack at [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]], breaking well into the German lines. Most disquieting was that some German commanders surrendered their units and that reserves arriving at the front were taunted for prolonging the war. For Ludendorff Amiens was the \"black day in the history of the German Army\".<ref>Ludendorff, 1919 '''2''' p. 326.</ref> Bauer and others wanted Ludendorff replaced, but Hindenburg stuck by his friend, he knew that \u201cMany a time has the soldier's calling exhausted strong characters\".<ref>Hindenburg,1921, '''2''', p. 126.</ref> A sympathetic physician who was a friend of Ludendorff's persuaded him to leave headquarters temporarily to recuperate. (His breakdown is not mentioned in Hindenburg's or Ludendorff's memoirs.) On 12 August Army Group von Boehn was created to firm up the defenses in the Somme sector. On 29 September Hindenburg and Ludendorff told the incredulous kaiser that the war was lost and that they must have an immediate armistice.\n\n====Defeat and revolution====\nA new chancellor, [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]], opened negotiations with President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who would deal only with a democratic Germany. Prince Max told the kaiser that he would resign unless Ludendorff was dismissed, but that Hindenburg was indispensable to hold the army together. On 26 October the Kaiser slated Ludendorff before curtly accepting his resignation {{mdash}} then rejecting Hindenburg's. Afterwards, Ludendorff refused to share Hindenburg's limousine.<ref>M\u00fcller, 1961, p. 413.</ref> Colonel [[Max Bauer|Bauer]] was retired. Hindenburg promptly replaced Ludendorff with Groener, now chief of staff of [[Army Group Mackensen (Poland)|Army Group Kiev]], which was assisting a breakaway [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainian government]] to fend off the Bolsheviks while expropriating food and oil.\n\nThey were losing their allies. In June the Austro-Hungarians in Italy attacked the Entente lines along the [[Second Battle of the Piave River|Piave River]] but were repelled decisively. On 24 October the Italians crossed the river in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]], after a few days of resolute resistance the defense collapsed, weakened by the defection of men from the empire's subject nations and starvation: the men in their Sixth Army had an average weight of {{convert|120|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref>Herwig, 1997, p. 434.</ref> On 14 October The Austro-Hungarians asked for an armistice in Italy, but the fighting went on. In September the Entente and their Greek allies [[Vardar Offensive|attacked]] in Macedonia. The Bulgarians begged for more Germans to stiffen their troops, but Hindenburg had none to spare. Many Bulgarian soldiers deserted as they retreated toward home, opening the road to Constantinople. The Austro-Hungarians were pushed back [[Liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)|in Serbia, Albania and Montenegro]], signing an armistice on 3 November. The Ottomans were overextended, trying to defend Syria while exploiting the Russian collapse to move into the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus]], advancing through Armenia and Georgia intending to take over Muslim lands, despite Hindenburg's urging them to defend what they had. The British and Arabs [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|broke]] through in September, capturing Damascus. The [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed on 30 October.\n\nWilson insisted that the kaiser must go, but he refused to abdicate, he was determined to lead the Prussian Army home to suppress the growing [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|rebellion]], which had started with large demonstrations in major cities and then, when the navy ordered a sortie to battle the British, mutineers led by workers' and soldiers' councils took control of the navy, these councils spread rapidly throughout Germany. They stripped officers of their badges of rank and decorations, if necessary forcibly. On 8 November Hindenburg told the kaiser that 39 regimental officers had been brought to Spa; where he delivered a situation report and answered questions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stephenson|first1=Scott|title=The Final Battle.

The answers were decisive: the army would not. The kaiser gave in, superfluously because in Berlin Prince Max had already publicly announced his abdication, his own resignation, and that the Social Democrat leader [[Friedrich Ebert]] was now chancellor. Democracy came abruptly and almost bloodlessly. That evening Groener telephoned Ebert, who he knew and trusted, to tell him that if the new government would fight Bolshevism and support the Army then the field marshal would lead a disciplined army home.<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, 1935, pp. 207\u201308.</ref> Hindenburg's remaining in command bolstered the new government's position.\n\n[[File:Bristoler Stra\u00dfe 6 Ecke Ludwig-Barney-Stra\u00dfe Hannover-Zoo Hindenburg-Villa Hindenburgviertel Emil Lorenz 1906 Paul von Hindenburg Fritz-Behrens-Stiftung.jpg|thumb|The Hindenburg villa in [[Hanover]]|upright=1.5]]\n\nThe withdrawal became more fraught when the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]] obliged all German troops to leave Belgium, France and [[Alsace-Lorraine|Alsace Lorraine]] in 14 days and to be behind the Rhine in 30 days. Stragglers would become prisoners. When the seven men from the executive committee of the soldiers' council formed at Spa arrived at ''OHL'' they were greeted politely by a lieutenant colonel, who acknowledged their leadership. When they broached the march home he took them to the map room, explaining allocation of roads, scheduling unit departures, billeting and feeding. They agreed that the existing staffs should make these arrangements.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Watt|first1=Richard M.|title=The king's depart : The tragedy of Germany, Versailles and the German revolution|date=1969|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|pages=205\u201306}}</ref> To oversee the withdrawals ''OHL'' transferred headquarters from Belgium to [[Kassel]] in Germany, unsure how their officers would be received by the revolutionaries.

Hindenburg refused because they did not have the kaiser's permission, instead settling into a humble inn, thereby pleasing both his monarchist staff and the revolutionary masses.

Instead they manned independent [[Freikorps]] (modeled on formations used in the Napoleonic wars), supplying them with weapons and equipment. In February 1919 ''OHL'' moved east to [[Ko\u0142obrzeg|Kolberg]] to mount an offensive against impinging Soviet troops, but they were restrained by the Allied occupation administration, which in May 1919 ordered all German troops in the east home.

(With engines, German movement overwhelmed western Europe in World War II.)\n\nSurprisingly, Hindenburg has undergone a historical metamorphosis: his teaching of tactics and years on the General Staff forgotten while he is remembered as a commander as an appendage to Ludendorff's genius.

I described it in short terms and emphasized especially that based on my own observations I thought the condition of the troops was cause for serious concern.  For the past few days the Seventh Army commanding general, the staff, and I had all been recommending a  withdrawal from the increasingly untenable front lines.

Parties representing a broad range of different constituencies ran candidates and voting was with proportional representation, so inevitably governments were formed by coalitions of parties: this time [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], Democrats, and Centrists. [[Friedrich Ebert|Ebert]] was elected as provisional chancellor; then the elected representatives assembled in Weimar to write a [[Weimar Constitution|constitution]]. It was based on the [[Constitution of the German Empire]] written in 1871, with many of the kaiser's powers now given to a president elected for a term of seven years. The president selected the chancellor and the members of the cabinet, but with the crucial stipulation that his nominees had to be ratified by the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], which because of proportional representation required support from several parties. The constitution was adopted on 11 August 1919. Ebert was elected as provisional president.\n\nThe terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] were written in secret. It was unveiled on 7 May 1919 and was followed by an ultimatum: either ratify the treaty, or the Allies would take whatever measures they deemed necessary to enforce its terms. While Germans of all political shades cursed the treaty as an insult to the nation's honor, President Ebert was sober enough to consider the possibility that Germany would not be in a position to turn it down. To save face, he asked Hindenburg whether the army was prepared to defend against an Allied invasion from the west, which Ebert believed would be all but certain if the treaty were voted down. If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out, he promised to urge rejection of the treaty. Under some prodding from his chief of staff, Groener, Hindenburg concluded the army could not resume the war under any circumstances. Rather than tell Ebert himself, he directed Groener to deliver the army's recommendation to the president.<ref name=\"RiseFall\">William Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' (Touchstone Edition) (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1990)</ref>  With just 19 minutes to spare, Ebert informed French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] that Germany would ratify the Treaty, which was signed on 28 June 1919.\n\n===Second retirement===\nBack in Hanover, as a field marshal he was provided with a staff who helped with his still extensive correspondence. He made few formal public appearances, but the streets around his house often were crowded with admirers when he took his afternoon walk. During the war he had left the newspaper reporters to Ludendorff, now he was available. He hunted locally and elsewhere, including an annual chamois hunt in Bavaria. The yearly Tannenberg memorial celebration kept him in the public eye.\n\nA Berlin publisher urged him to produce his memoirs which could educate and inspire by emphasizing his ethical and spiritual values; his story and ideas could be put on paper by a team of anonymous collaborators and the book would be translated immediately for the worldwide market.<ref>Dorpalen, Andreas ''Hindenburg and the Weimar Republic'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1964 pp.  44\u201345.</ref> ''Mein Leben'' (My Life) was a huge bestseller, presenting to the world his carefully crafted image as a staunch, steadfast, uncomplicated soldier. Major themes were the need for Germany to maintain a strong military as the school teaching young German men moral values and the need to restore the monarchy, because only under the leadership of the House of Hohenzollern could Germany become great again, with \"The conviction that the subordination of the individual to the good of the community was not only a necessity, but a positive blessing ...\".<ref>Hindenburg, '''1''', 1920, p. 89.</ref> Throughout the kaiser is treated with great respect.

They had been strangers since Ludendorff's dismissal, but they prepared and arrived together on 18 November 1919. Hindenburg refused to take the oath until Ludendorff was permitted to read a statement that they were under no obligation to testify since their answers might expose them to criminal prosecution, but they were waiving their right of refusal. On the stand Hindenburg read through a prepared statement, ignoring the chairman's repeated demands that he answer questions. He testified that the German Army had been on the verge of winning the war in the autumn of 1918 and that the defeat had been precipitated by a ''[[Dolchsto\u00df]]'' (\"stab in the back\") by disloyal elements on the home front and unpatriotic politicians, quoting an unnamed British general: \"The German Army was stabbed in the back.\" When his reading was finished Hindenburg walked out of the hearings, despite being threatened with contempt, sure that they would not dare charge a war hero. His testimony introduced the ''[[Dolchsto\u00dflegende]]'', which was adopted by nationalist and conservative politicians who sought to blame the socialist founders of the Weimar Republic for losing the war. Reviews in the German press that grossly misrepresented General [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Frederick Barton Maurice's]] book about the last months of the war firmed-up this myth.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maurice|first1=Major-General Sir F.|title=The last four months : the end of the war in the west|url=https://archive.org/details/lastfourmonthsen00mauruoft|date=1919|publisher=Cassell and Co|location=London}}</ref> Ludendorff had used these reviews to convince Hindenburg.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shirer|first1=William L.|title=The rise and fall of the Third Reich|url=https://archive.org/details/risefallthirdreich00shir|url-access=registration|date=1960|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/risefallthirdreich00shir/page/n46 31]}}</ref>  A 1929 film glorifying his life as a dedicated patriot solidified his image.<ref>Anna Menge,  \"The Iron Hindenburg: a popular icon of Weimar Germany.\" ''German History'' 26.3 (2008): 357\u201382.</ref>\n\n[[File:H & wife.jpg|thumb|Paul and Gertrud von Hindenburg|upright=1.0|left]]\n\nThe first presidential election was scheduled for 6 June 1920. Hindenburg wrote to Wilhelm II, in exile in the Netherlands, for permission to run.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Wilhelm approved, so on 8 March Hindenburg announced his intention to seek the presidency. Five days later Berlin was seized by regular and ''Freicorp'' troops led by General L\u00fcttwitz, the commander of the Berlin garrison, who proclaimed a prominent civil servant, [[Wolfgang Kapp]], president in a new government. Ludendorff and Colonel Bauer stood by Kapp's side. As the Reichswehr leadership refused to fight the coup, the legal government fled to Stuttgart. However the coup collapsed after six days as the civil service refused to cooperate and workers went on a general strike. The strike led to a Bolshevik uprising that was put down forcefully. Kapp died in prison while awaiting trial, Ludendorff fled to Bavaria where he was shielded by his fame, Bauer went into exile. The Reichstag postponed the presidential election and extended Ebert's term of office. Hindenburg cut back on public appearances.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. p. 55.</ref>\n\nHis serenity was shattered by the illness of his wife [[Gertrud von Hindenburg|Gertrud]], who died of cancer on 14 May 1921. He kept close to his three children, their spouses and his nine grandchildren. His son Oskar was at his side as the field marshal's liaison officer. Hindenburg was financially sustained by a fund set up by a group of admiring industrialists.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. p. 62.</ref>\n\nOn 8 November 1923 Hitler, with Ludendorff at his side, launched the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in Munich, which was suppressed by the Bavarian police. Hindenburg was not involved but inevitably was prominent in newspaper reports. He issued a statement urging national unity.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964, p. 63.</ref> On 16 November the [[Reichsbank]] introduced the [[German Rentenmark|Rentenmark]], which was indexed to gold bonds. Twelve zeros were cut from prices, which stabilized. The political divisions in the nation began to ease. The foreign minister was [[Gustav Stresemann]], the leader of the [[German People's Party]]. In 1924 the economy was shored up by the reduction in reparation payments in the [[Dawes Plan]] with loans from American banks. At Tannenberg in August before a crowd of 50,000 Hindenburg laid the headstone for an imposing memorial.\n\n==1925 election==\n''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' Ebert died on 28 February 1925 following an appendectomy. A new election had to be held within a month. None of the candidates attained the required majority; Ludendorff was last with a paltry 280,000 votes. By law there had to be another election. The Social Democrats, the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre]] and other democratic parties united to support the Centre's [[Wilhelm Marx]], who had twice served as chancellor and was now Minister President of Prussia. The [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] insisted on running their own candidate. The parties on the right established a committee to select their strongest candidate. After a week's indecision they decided on Hindenburg, despite his advanced age and fear, notably by Foreign Minister Stresemann, of unfavorable reactions by their former enemies. A delegation came to his home on 1 April. He stated his reservations but concluded \"If you feel that my election is necessary for the sake of the Fatherland, I'll run in God's name.\"<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. p. 71.</ref> However, some parties on the right still opposed him. Not willing to be humiliated like Ludendorff he drafted a telegram declining the nomination, but before it was sent, Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] and a young leader of the agrarian nobility of eastern Germany arrived in Hanover to persuade him to wait until the strength of his support was clearer. His conservative opponents gave way so he consented on 9 April. Again he obtained Wilhelm II's approval. His campaign stressed his devotion to \"social justice, religious equality, genuine peace at home and abroad.\"<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. p. 76.</ref> \"No war, no internal uprising, can emancipate our chained nation, which is, unfortunately, split by dissension.\" He addressed only one public meeting, held in Hanover, and gave one radio address on 11 April calling for a ''Volksgemeinschaft'' (national community) under his leadership.<ref>Pyta, 2014, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> The [[1925 German presidential election|second election]], held on 26 April 1925, required only a plurality, which he obtained thanks to the support of the [[Bavarian People's Party]] (BVP), which had switched from Marx, and by the refusal of the Communists to withdraw their candidate [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Richard J. |title=The coming of the Third Reich |date=2003 |publisher=[[Allen Lane]] |location=London |page=82}}</ref> In Britain and France the victory of the aged field marshal was accepted with equanimity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hindenburg |website=Sunday Times Digital Archive |page=14 |date=3 May 1925 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Herriot |first1=Edouard |title=Hindenburg's election |website=Sunday Times Digital Archive |location=London |page=14 |date=10 May 1925}}</ref>\n\n==Parliamentary governments==\n[[File:Reichspr\u00e4sidentenpalais, Berlin.jpg|thumb|The presidential palace|upright=1.5]]\n\nHindenburg took office on 12 May 1925, \"... offering my hand in this hour to every German\".<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. p. 88.</ref> He moved into the elegant Presidential Palace on the Wilhelmstrasse, accompanied by Oskar (his military liaison officer) and Oskar's wife and three children. The new president, always a stickler about uniforms, soon had the servants wear new regalia with the shoe buckles appropriate for a court.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ludwig |first1=Emil |title=Hindenburg and the saga of the German revolution |date=1935 |publisher=William Heinemann |location=London |page=265}}</ref> Nearby was the chancellery, which during Hindenburg's tenure would have seven residents. The president also enjoyed a shooting preserve. He notified Chancellor [[Hans Luther]] that he would replace the head of Ebert's presidential staff, Dr [[Otto Meissner]], with his own man, because the cabinet would have to consent. Meissner was kept on temporarily. He proved invaluable and was Hindenburg's right hand throughout his presidency.\n\nForeign Minister Stresemann had vacationed during the campaign so as not to tarnish his reputation with the victors by supporting the field marshal. The far right detested Stresemann for promoting friendly relations with the victors. At their first meeting Hindenburg listened attentively and was persuaded that Stresemann's strategy was correct.<ref>Berman, 1987, p. 88.</ref> He was cooler at their next, reacting to rightist backlash.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. p. 94.</ref> Nonetheless he supported the government's policy, so on 1 December 1925 the [[Locarno Treaties]] were signed, a significant step in restoring Germany's position in Europe. The right was infuriated because the Treaty accepted the loss of Alsace and Lorraine, though it mandated the withdrawal of the Allied troops occupying the Rhineland. The president always was lobbied intensely by visitors and letter writers. Hindenburg countered demands to restore the monarchy by arguing that restoring a Hohenzollern would block progress in revising Versailles.<ref>Pyta, 2014, pp. 25\u201347.</ref> He accepted the republic as the mechanism for restoring Germany's position in Europe, though Hindenburg was no ''Vernunftrepublikaner'' (republican by reason) because democracy was incompatible with the militaristic ''volksgemeinschaft'' (national community) that would unite the people into one for future conflicts.<ref>Pyta, 2014, p. 36.</ref>\n\nThe Treaty ended Luther's government, so Hindenburg had to assemble its replacement. The president could not command, but had to practice politics in the raw: painstakingly listening to and negotiating with party leaders to put together a bloc with a majority. Occasionally he was able to seal a deal as the revered, old field marshal by appealing to patriotism. After weeks of negotiations, Luther formed a new government with a cabinet drawn from the middle-of-the road parties, retaining Stresemann, which the Reichstag approved when threatened that otherwise the president would call new elections. That government was toppled by dispute over flying the old imperial flag alongside of the Weimar colors, which symbolically downgraded the republic. Marx was recalled as chancellor in a government that continued the dual flag policy. The next major issue was the properties of the former kings now held by the states: the question was whether former rulers should receive some compensation or none. More than 12 million voters petitioned for a referendum on this issue, meanwhile the Reichstag was debating an expropriation bill. Hindenburg's impulse was to resign so that he might express his opposition, but instead Meissner persuaded him to write a personal letter, which appeared in the newspapers, opposing expropriation. The referendum on 20 June 1926 rejected expropriation. Hindenburg urged the states to reach fair settlements promptly, otherwise he would resign. Stresemann's position in successive governments was solidified when he shared the Nobel Peace Prize for 1926.\n\n[[File:DR 1927 405 Paul von Hindenburg Nothilfe.jpg|thumb|180px| A Hindenburg stamp released in 1927 on the occasion of his 80th birthday]]\nThe next crisis came in the autumn of 1926 when ''Reichswehr'' commander Seeckt, without consulting the ''Reichswehr'' minister, invited the eldest son of the ex-crown prince to attend maneuvers. To keep the government in office, Hindenburg pressured Seeckt to resign. His successor was Wilhelm Heye. The Social Democrats shifted their stance and were willing to join a centrist government, which would strengthen it. Hindenburg was agreeable. But then the socialists demanded a completely new cabinet, which the government rejected, consequently the ''Reichstag'' voted no confidence after oratory that made much of the secret collaboration between the ''Reichswehr'' and the Red Army, which had been revealed in British newspapers. To counter these attacks the ''Reichswehr'' relied on Colonel [[Kurt von Schleicher]], who had served with Oskar in the Third Guards and was often a guest at the Palace. He assiduously strove to improve relations with the Republic. Again Hindenburg was saddled with finding a new government. He asked Marx to bring in more parties. The German Nationals agreed to join, and a new government was in place on 31 January 1927. It legislated the eight hour day and unemployment insurance.\n\nOn 18 September 1927 Hindenburg spoke at the dedication of the massive memorial at Tannenberg, outraging international opinion by denying Germany's responsibility for initiating World War I, thereby repudiating Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles. He declared that Germany entered the war as \"the means of self-assertion against a world full of enemies. Pure in heart we set off to the defence of the fatherland and with clean hands the German army carried the sword.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Great War and Medieval Memory: War, Remembrance and Medievalism in Britain and Germany, 1914\u20131940 |series=Studies in the Social and Cultural History of Modern Warfare |first=Stefan |last=Goebel |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=139 |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-85415-3}}</ref> His words were much stronger than in the draft approved by Stresemann. The Allied governments retaliated by not congratulating him on his eightieth birthday. (He was more upset by Ludendorff's refusal to have any contact at the ceremony.) Most Germans did celebrate his birthday: his present was Neudeck, the ancestral East Prussian estate of the Hindenburgs, purchased with funds from a public subscription. Later it became known that the title was in Oskar's name, to avoid potential inheritance tax.\n\nA financial scandal in the navy led to the resignation of the defense minister. As his replacement, Schleicher wanted Groener, whose chief-of-staff he had been late in the war. The right strongly opposed him, but the Reichstag approved. Groener in turn enhanced Schleicher's role in the army. The Reichstag's four-year term was coming to an end, so Hindenburg pressed it to promptly pass required legislation and then dissolved it on 31 March 1928. His leadership was widely applauded.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. p. 139.</ref> The election on 20 May 1928 produced a shift to the left, although a handful of Nazis were elected. However, it was difficult to assemble a new government because several parties were reluctant to participate. Finally, sufficient support was found for the Social Democrat [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]] whom Hindenburg found clever and agreeable, later telling Groener that M\u00fcller was his best chancellor.<ref>Berman, 1987, p. 143.</ref>\n\n==Presidential governments==\nThe next crisis followed Stresemann's negotiation of the [[Young Plan]], which rescheduled reparations payments and opened the way for needed American loans. In addition, the French promised to leave the Rhineland in 1930, five years before schedule. The right formed a committee to block adoption, they started by intensively lobbying Hindenburg, using such powerful voices as Tirpitz. Hindenburg did not budge. For the first time the committee brought conservatives, like the powerful newspaper owner [[Alfred Hugenberg]], into alliance with the Nazis. They submitted the issues to a national plebiscite, in which they obtained only one-fifth of the vote. In his open letter when he promulgated the required legislation, Hindenburg pointed out that their major problem was the economic turmoil and growing unemployment stemming from the worldwide depression.\n\n[[File:Unemployment weimar.jpg|thumb|Percentage of German workers unemployed, 1920-1935|upright=1.5|right]]\n\nHis close advisers were Oskar, Groener, Meissner, and Schleicher, known as the ''[[Camarilla|Kamarilla]]''. The younger Hindenburg, \"the constitutionally unforeseen son of the President\", controlled access to the President.<ref>Turner, Henry Ashby ''Hitler's Thirty Days to Power'', Reading: Addison-Wesley, 1996 p. 113.</ref> Hindenburg tried to assemble the next government by obtaining enough support from political parties while retaining essential ministers such as Groener and Stresemann, but was unable to form a working combination, the parties were too diverse and divided. A new election would only reinforce these bitter divisions. Schleicher proposed a solution: a government in which the chancellor would be responsible to the president rather than the Reichstag, based on the so-called \"25/48/53 formula\",<ref name=\"J\u00e4ckel, Eberhard page 3\">J\u00e4ckel, Eberhard ''Hitler in History'' Hanover NH: Brandeis University Press, 1984 pp. 3\u20135.</ref> named for the three articles of the Constitution that could make such a \"Presidential government\" possible:\n* Article 25 allowed the President to dissolve the Reichstag.\n* [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] allowed the president to sign emergency bills into law without the consent of the Reichstag. However, the Reichstag could cancel any law passed by Article 48 by a simple majority vote within sixty days of its passage.\n* Article 53 allowed the president to appoint the chancellor.\n\nSchleicher suggested that in such a presidential government the trained economist and leader of the [[Catholic Center Party]] (''Zentrum'') [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] would make an excellent chancellor. Hindenburg first talked with Br\u00fcning in February 1930. He was impressed by his probity and by his outstanding combat record as a machine gun officer; and was reconciled to his being a Catholic. In January 1930, Meissner told Kuno von Westarp that soon Muller's \"Grand Coalition\" would replaced by a \"presidential government\" that would exclude the Social Democrats, adding that the coming \"Hindenburg government\" would be \"anti-Marxist\" and \"anti-parliamentarian\", serving as a transition to a dictatorship.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kolb |first1=Eberhard |title=The Weimar Republic |date=2005 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |page=118}}</ref> Schleicher maneuvered to exacerbate a bitter dispute within M\u00fcller's coalition, which was divided over whether the unemployment insurance rate should be raised by a half percentage point or a full percentage point.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nicolls |first1=Anthony |title=Weimar and the rise of Hitler |date=2000 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |location=London |page=139}}</ref> With the Grand Coalition government lacking support in the Reichstag, M\u00fcller asked Hindenburg to have his budget approved under Article 48, but Schleicher persuaded Hindenburg to refuse.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964, pp. 174\u201375.</ref> M\u00fcller's government fell on 27 March 1930 and Br\u00fcning became chancellor.

Faced with declining tax revenues and mounting costs for unemployment insurance, Br\u00fcning introduced an austerity budget with steep spending cuts and steep tax increases.<ref>J\u00e4ckel 1984, p. 5.</ref> The Young Plan required such a balanced budget. Nonetheless, his budget was defeated in the Reichstag in July 1930, so Hindenburg signed it into law by invoking Article 48. The Reichstag voted to repeal the budget, so Hindenburg dissolved it just two years into its mandate, and re-approved the budget with Article 48. Unemployment was still soaring. Hindenburg took no part in the campaign, in the September 1930 elections the Nazis achieved an electoral breakthrough, gaining 17 percent of the vote to become the second-strongest party in the Reichstag. The Communists also made striking gains, albeit not so great.\n\nAfter the elections, Br\u00fcning continued to govern largely through Article 48; his government was kept afloat by the Social Democrats who voted against canceling his Article 48 bills in order to avoid another election that could only benefit the Nazis and the Communists. The German historian [[Eberhard J\u00e4ckel]] concluded that presidential government was within the letter of the constitution, but violated its spirit as Article 54 stated the Chancellor and his cabinet were responsible to the Reichstag, and thus presidential government was an end-run around the constitution.<ref>J\u00e4ckel, 1984, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> Hindenburg for his part grew increasingly annoyed with Br\u00fcning, complaining that he was growing tired of using Article 48 all the time to pass bills. Hindenburg found the detailed notes that Br\u00fcning submitted explaining the economic necessity of each of his bills to be incomprehensible. Br\u00fcning continued with austerity, A decree in December 1930 once again cut the wages of public employees and the budget. Modest, withdrawn Br\u00fcning was completely unable to explain his measures to the voters, or even to the president, who relied on explanations from the ''Kamarilla''. The Nazis and German Nationals marched out of the Reichstag in opposition to a procedural rule. The 1931 budget was then passed easily, and the Reichstag adjourned until October after only increasing the military budget and the subsidies for Junkers in the so-called ''[[Osthilfe]]'' (Eastern Aid) program. In June 1931 there was a [[Great Depression|banking crisis]] in which the funds on deposit plummeted. Complete disaster was averted by United States President [[Herbert Hoover]] obtaining a temporary moratorium on reparation payments.\n\nIn the summer of 1931, Hindenburg complained in a letter to his daughter: \"What pains and angers me the most is being misunderstood by part of the political right\".<ref name=\"auto\">Pyta, 2014, p. 42.</ref> He met [[Adolf Hitler]] for the first time in October 1931, at a high-level conference in Berlin. Everyone present saw that they took an immediate dislike to each other. Afterwards Hindenburg in private often disparagingly referred to Hitler as \"that Austrian corporal\", \"that Bohemian corporal\" or sometimes simply as \"the corporal\" and also derided Hitler's Austrian dialect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Astore |first1=William |last2=Showalter |first2=Denis |title=Hindenburg: Icon of German Militarism |date=2005 |publisher=Potomac Books |location=Washington, DC |page=106}}</ref> For his part, Hitler often labeled Hindenburg as \"that old fool\" or \"that old reactionary\". On 26 January 1933, Hindenburg privately told a group of his friends: \"Gentlemen, I hope you will not hold me capable of appointing this Austrian corporal to be Reich Chancellor\".<ref>J\u00e4ckel, 1984, p. 8.</ref> Hindenburg made it clear that he saw himself as the leader of the \"national\" forces and expected Hitler to follow his lead.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn foreign affairs he spoke with hostility towards Poland, often expressing a hope that the Polish state would disappear from the map of Europe \"at an appropriate moment\"<ref>''A ridiculous hundred million Slavs: concerning Adolf Hitler's world-view'', Tadeusz Manteuffel, Institute of History, Polish Academy of Sciences, Jerzy Wojciech Borejsza, p. 55, Warsaw 2017</ref>\n\n==Second presidency==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99203, Berlin, Wahlplakat f\u00fcr Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|Election poster for Hindenburg in 1932 (translation: \"With him\")|upright=0.7]]\n\nBy January 1932, at the age of 84, Hindenburg was vacillating about running for a second term. Some authors have pointed out that uncertainty is suggestive of early senile dementia, which includes: restricted memory, especially of recent events and people, decrease in willed actions which may become apathy, and reduced problem solving ability.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Park |first1=Bert Edward |title=The impact of illness on world leaders |url=https://archive.org/details/impactofillnesso00bert |url-access=registration |date=1986 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |location=Philadelphia, PA |pages=[https://archive.org/details/impactofillnesso00bert/page/78 78\u201379]}}</ref> Br\u00fcning recalled that once the president came to meet him at the railway station, but failed to recognize him.<ref>Park, 1986, p. 80.</ref> On the other hand, [[Franz von Papen]], a later chancellor, found that despite minor lapses the president remained competent until his last days.<ref>Papen, 1952, p. 328.</ref> Hindenburg was persuaded to run by the Kamarilla, and supported by the Centre Party, the [[Deutsche Volkspartei]] (DVP) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), which regarded him as the only hope of defeating Hitler.<ref>Evans, 1995, p. 279.</ref> His fighting spirit was evoked by Nazi taunts when he appeared in public and in a few weeks three million Germans signed a petition urging him to carry on.

Hitler was to be one of his opponents in the election. Hindenburg left most campaigning to others, in his single radio address he stressed the need for unity, \"I recall the spirit of 1914, and the mood at the front, which asked about the man, and not about his class or party\".<ref>Pyta, 2014, p. 43.</ref> Hitler campaigned vigorously throughout Germany.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13227, Paul von Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|Hindenburg, aged 84, at a radio microphone in 1932 during the election campaign in which he defeated Hitler|left|upright=1.0]]\n\nIn the first round of voting in March 1932, Hindenburg was front-runner, but failed to gain the required majority.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nicolls |first1=Anothony |title=Weimar and the rise of Hitler |date=2000 |place=New York |publisher=Macmillan |page=159}}</ref> In the runoff the following month Hindenburg won with 53 percent of the vote. However, he was disappointed because he lost voters from the right, only winning by the support of those who had strongly opposed him seven years before. He wrote \"Despite all the blows in the neck I have taken, I will not abandon my efforts for a healthy move to the Right\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> He called in the party leaders for advice, during the meetings Meissner led the discussions while Hindenburg would only speak briefly on crucial points. Schleicher took the lead in choosing the cabinet, in which he was ''Reichswehr'' Minister. Groener was now even more unpopular to the right because he had banned wearing party uniforms in public. On 13 May 1932 Schleicher told Groener that he had \"lost the confidence of the Army\" and must resign at once.<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, 1967, p. 243.</ref> Once Groener was gone, the ban was lifted and the Nazi brownshirts were back battling on the streets.\n\nTo cope with mounting unemployment, Br\u00fcning desperately wanted an emergency decree to launch a program in which bankrupt estates would be carved up into small farms and turned over to unemployed settlers. When they met, Hindenburg read a statement that there would be no further decrees and insisted that the cabinet resign, there must be a turn to the right. Br\u00fcning resigned on 1 June 1932. He was succeeded by Papen from the Centre Party, who was Schleicher's choice, Hindenburg did not even ask the party leaders for advice. He was delighted with Papen, a rich, smooth aristocrat who had been a famous equestrian and a general staff officer; he soon became a Hindenburg family friend (Schleicher was no longer welcomed because he had quarreled with Oskar). The president was delighted to find that eight members of the new cabinet had served as officers during the war.\n\nThanks to the previous government, reparations were phased out at the [[Lausanne Conference of 1932|Lausanne Conference]], but without progress on other issues, so it was attacked by the German right. The Social Democratic government of the State of Prussia was a caretaker, because it had lost its mandate in the preceding election. Papen accused it of failing to maintain public order, and removed it on 20 July. The national elections came eleven days later. Eight parties received substantial numbers of votes, but those supporting the government lost strength, while opponents on the right and left gained. The Nazis polled almost the same 37 percent they had in the presidential election, making them the largest party in the Reichstag. Schleicher negotiated with them, proposing that Hitler become vice-chancellor. Hitler demanded the chancellorship along with five cabinet positions and important posts in the state governments; additionally the Reichstag would have to pass an [[Enabling act]] giving a new government all needed powers, otherwise it would be dissolved. Around the country Nazi stormtroopers were running riot, attacking their political opponents. Hindenburg refused to make Hitler chancellor, so he met with Hitler to explain that he was unwilling to bring a single party to power, concluding with \"I want to extend my hand to you as a fellow soldier.\"<ref>Dorpalen, 1964, p. 355.</ref> The following morning he left for Neudeck; most of the newspapers praised his defense of the constitution. The constitution mandated a new election within sixty days, but owing to the crisis Hindenburg postponed it. Papen published an economic recovery plan that almost all of the parties and the labor unions lambasted. His scant support crumbled further.\n\nTo add enough votes to gain a parliamentary mandate, Schleicher tried to persuade some of the Nazi leaders, like the war hero [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], to defect and to take a position in his government. None of them would, so he became another presidential chancellor, still courting prominent Nazis\u2014otherwise his days as chancellor were numbered. Papen continued to negotiate with Hitler, who moderated his conditions: he would settle for the chancellorship, the Reich Commissioner of Prussia and two cabinet positions: interior and a new slot for aviation. He also promised that he would respect the rights of the president, the Reichstag and the press, and Papen would be vice-chancellor. On these terms, Hindenburg allowed Oskar and Meissner to meet secretly with Hitler, culminating in an hour's ''t\u00eate-\u00e1-t\u011bte'' between Hitler and Oskar. Schleicher learned of the secret meeting and the following morning met with the president to demand emergency powers and the dissolution of the Reichstag. Hindenburg refused the powers but agreed to the election. Before a new government could be formed Hindenburg called General [[Werner von Blomberg]], an opponent of Schleicher, back from a disarmament conference and appointed him ''Reichswehr'' minister, perhaps unaware that he was a Nazi sympathizer.\n\n==Hitler becomes chancellor==\nTo break the stalemate, Hindenburg proposed Hitler as chancellor, Papen as vice-chancellor and Reich commissioner of Prussia, and G\u00f6ring as Prussian interior minister (who controlled the police). Two other cabinet ministers would be Nazis, the remaining eight would be from other parties. When Hindenburg met with Hitler, Papen would always be present. The new cabinet included only three Nazis: Hitler, G\u00f6ring and [[Wilhelm Frick]]. Besides Hitler, Frick was the only Nazi with a portfolio; he held the nearly powerless Interior Ministry (unlike the rest of Europe, at the time the Interior Ministry had no power over the police, which was the responsibility of the ''L\u00e4nder''). G\u00f6ring did not receive a portfolio, but critically was made Prussian interior minister, controlling the largest police force in which he promoted Nazis as commanders. Blomberg was Reichswehr minister, Hugenberg was both economics and agriculture minister, and Seldte (the leader of the right wing [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm party]]) was labor minister. The other ministers were holdovers from the Papen and Schleicher cabinets.\n\nHitler's first act as chancellor was to ask Hindenburg to dissolve the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], so that the Nazis and [[Deutschnationale Volkspartei]] (\"German Nationalists\" or DNVP) could win an outright majority to pass the [[Enabling Act]] that would give the new government power to rule by decree, supposedly for the next four years. Unlike laws passed by Article 48, which could be cancelled by a majority in the ''Reichstag'', under the Enabling Act the Chancellor could pass laws by decree that could not be cancelled by a vote in the ''Reichstag''.  Hindenburg agreed to this request. In early February 1933, Papen asked for and received an Article 48 bill signed into law that sharply limited [[freedom of the press]]. After the [[Reichstag fire]] on 27 February, Hindenburg, at Hitler's urging, signed into law the ''[[Reichstag Fire Decree]]'' via Article 48, which effectively suspended all civil liberties in Germany. G\u00f6ring as Prussian Interior Minister had enlisted thousands of [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) men as auxiliary policemen, who attacked political opponents of the Nazis, with [[Communist]]s and [[Social Democrat]]s being singled out for particular abuse. [[Fritz Sch\u00e4ffer]], a conservative Catholic and a leading politician of the [[Bavarian People's Party]] met Hindenburg on 17 February 1933 to complain about the ongoing campaign of terror against the SPD.<ref>{{cite book |first=Wolfram |last=Pyta |chapter=Hindenburg and the German Right |title=The German Right in the Weimar Republic: Studies in the History of German Conservatism, Nationalism, and Antisemitism |editor-first=Larry Eugene |editor-last=Jones |publisher=Berghahn Books |date=2014 |isbn=978-1785332012 |page=41}}</ref> Sch\u00e4ffer told Hindenburg: {{quote|We reject the notion that millions of Germans are not to be designated as national.

Therefore, the Nazis had his full support in their campaign against the Social Democrats.<ref name=\"Pyta pages 25\"/>\n\nHindenburg disliked Hitler, but he approved of his efforts to create the ''[[volksgemeinschaft]]''.<ref name=\"Pyta pages 25\"/> For Hindenburg, the \"Government of National Concentration\" headed by Hitler was the fulfillment of what he had been seeking since 1914, the creation of the ''volksgemeinschaft''.<ref name=\"Pyta pages 25\"/> Despite the ensuing anti-red hysteria, the Nazis received only 44% of the vote, though with the support of the DNVP they had a majority in the Reichstag.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S38324, Tag von Potsdam, Adolf Hitler, Paul v. Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|Hitler and Hindenburg at the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Garrison Church]] in [[Potsdam]]|left|upright=1.0]]\n\nHitler soon obtained Hindenburg's confidence, promising that after Germany regained full sovereignty, the monarchy would be restored; after a few weeks Hindenburg no longer asked Papen to join their meetings. The opening of the new Reichstag was celebrated with a Nazi extravaganza: Hindenburg descended into the crypt of the old garrison church in Potsdam to commune with the spirit of [[Frederick the Great]] at his grave, attended by Hitler who saluted the president as \"the custodian of the new rise of our people.\"<ref>Dorpalen, 1964, p. 466.</ref> An [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] was prepared that transferred law-making from the Reichstag to the government, even if the new laws violated the constitution. With the Communist deputies and many Social Democrats kept out of the chamber (in violation of Articles 36 and 37 of the constitution), the Reichstag passed the Act with well more than the needed two-thirds majority, effectively ending the Republic. As it turned out, that meeting took place in such an intimidating atmosphere that the Enabling Act would have garnered the required supermajority even with all deputies present and voting.\n\nDuring 1933 and 1934, Hitler was very aware of the fact that Hindenburg's power to sack him was the only means by which he could be legally removed from office. With the passage of the Enabling Act and the banning of all parties other than the Nazis, Hindenburg was the only check on Hitler's power. Given that Hindenburg was still a popular war hero and a revered figure in the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', there was little doubt that the ''Reichswehr'' would side with Hindenburg if he ever decided to sack Hitler. Thus, as long as Hindenburg was alive, Hitler was always very careful to avoid offending him or the Army.  Although Hindenburg was in increasingly bad health, the Nazis made sure that whenever Hindenburg did appear in public it was in Hitler's company. During these appearances, Hitler always made a point of showing him the utmost respect and deference. However, in private, Hitler detested Hindenburg, and expressed his hope that \"the old reactionary\" would hurry up and die as soon as possible.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-2006-0429-502,_Tannenberg-Denkmal,_Beisetzung_Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|The [[Tannenberg Memorial]] where Hindenburg and his wife were buried|upright=1.0]]\n\n[[Economy of Nazi Germany|Economic austerity]] was abandoned as Hitler poured money into new programs hiring the unemployed, buying [[Economy of Nazi Germany|armaments]], and building infrastructure\u2014especially roads and ''autobahns''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Overy|first1=R. J.|title=War and economy in the Third Reich|date=1994|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford, England|pages=37\u201389}}</ref> Within a year, unemployment fell by almost 40%. Hitler gained the support of the armed forces by promising to rebuild their strength. The German states were taken over by the national government, the labor unions were suppressed, political opponents were imprisoned, and Jews were ejected from the civil service which included the universities. Hindenburg only objected about the treatment of Jews; he wanted war veterans retained, to which Hitler acceded. When Hitler moved to eject Hugenberg from the cabinet and to suppress the political parties, a trusted colleague of Hugenberg's was sent to Neudeck to appeal for assistance but only met with Oskar. Hindenburg delayed the appointment of one Nazi ''Gauleiter'', but failed to obtain the installation of a Lutheran bishop he favored. The honor guard at Neudeck now were storm troopers. On 27 August at the stirring ceremonies at Tannenberg the president was presented with two large East Prussian properties near Neudeck. On the night before the plebiscite on Nazi rule scheduled for 11 November 1933, Hindenburg appealed to the voters to support their president and their chancellor, 95.1% of those voting did so. When a new commander of the army was to be appointed the president's choice won out over the chancellor's, but Hindenburg accepted a change in the military oath that eliminated obedience to the president and placed the swastika on military uniforms. By summer 1934, Hindenburg was dying of metastasized [[bladder cancer]] and his correspondence was dominated by complaints of Nazi stormtroopers running amok.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kershaw|first1=Ian|authorlink=Ian Kershaw|title=Hitler. 1889\u20131936: Hubris|date=1995|publisher=W.W.

But precisely because I share this sentiment, I must urgently warn against the step you plan to take. ... The domestic crisis is not yet completely over, and foreign powers will have a hard time imagining me on the sidelines if it comes to a restoration of the monarchy. ... To say this is unbelievably painful for me.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}\n\nDuring the summer of 1934, Hindenburg grew increasingly alarmed at Nazi excesses. With his support, Papen gave [[Marburg speech|a speech]] at the [[University of Marburg]] on 17 June calling for an end to state terror and the restoration of some freedoms.  When Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] got wind of it, he not only canceled a scheduled tape-delayed broadcast of the speech, but ordered the seizure of newspapers in which part of the text was printed.<ref name=\"RiseFall\"/>\n\nPapen was furious, telling Hitler that he was acting as a \"trustee\" of Hindenburg, and that a \"junior minister\" like Goebbels had no right to silence him. He resigned and immediately notified Hindenburg about what happened. Hindenburg was equally outraged, and told Blomberg to give Hitler an ultimatum\u2014unless Hitler took steps to end the growing tension in Germany and rein in the SA, Hindenburg would sack him, declare [[martial law]] and turn the government over to the army. Not long afterward, Hitler carried out the [[Night of the Long Knives]], in which the SA's leaders were murdered, for which he received Hindenburg's personal thanks in a telegram.<ref name=\"RiseFall\"/><ref name=Evans>{{cite book|title=The Third Reich Trilogy#The Third Reich In Power|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|authorlink=Richard J.

The day before Hitler received word that Hindenburg was on his deathbed.  He then had the cabinet pass the \"Law Concerning the Highest State Office of the Reich,\" which stipulated that upon Hindenburg's death, the offices of president and chancellor would be merged under the title of Leader and chancellor (''F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler'').<ref>{{cite book|title=The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia|last=Overy|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Overy|publisher=W.W.

He worked feverishly to get the armed forces\u2014the only group in Germany that would be nearly powerful enough to remove him with Hindenburg gone\u2014to support his bid to become head of state after Hindenburg's death.  In a meeting aboard the ''[[German cruiser Deutschland|Deutschland]]'' on April 11 with Blomberg, army commander [[Werner von Fritsch]] and naval commander [[Erich Raeder]], Hitler publicly proposed that he himself succeed Hindenburg. In return for the armed forces' support, he agreed to suppress the SA and promised that the armed forces would be the only bearers of arms in Germany under his watch. Raeder agreed right away, but Fritsch withheld his support until May 18, when the senior generals unanimously agreed to back Hitler as Hindenburg's successor.<ref name=\"RiseFall\"/>\n\nHitler had [[1934 German referendum|a plebiscite held on 19 August 1934]], in which the German people were asked if they approved of Hitler merging the two offices. The ''Ja'' (Yes) vote amounted to 90% of the vote.\n\nContrary to Hindenburg's will, he was interred with his wife in a magnificent ceremony at the [[Tannenberg Memorial]]. In 1944, as the Russians approached, ''Generalleutnant'' Oskar von Hindenburg moved his parents' remains to western Germany. After World War II the Poles razed the Tannenberg Memorial to the ground.\n\nThe remains of Hindenburg and his wife currently lie buried in [[St. Elizabeth's Church, Marburg]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Hindenburg Porzellan Medaille 1927.jpg|thumb|Porcelain medal in honour of Hindenburg's 80<sup>th</sup> birthday on Oct. 2, 1927, produced  by [[:en:Meissen porcelain|Staatliche Porzellan-Manufaktur Meissen]]]]\nAccording to historian Anna Menge:\n{{Quote|The intensity, longevity, striking political and social breadth, and political deployment of the adulation for Hindenburg\u2014in short, the power of the Hindenburg myth from 1914 until 1934 and beyond\u2014was a political phenomenon of the first order....The Hindenburg myth was one of the central narratives in German public discourse during the First World War, the Weimar Republic, and the early years of Nazi rule. The striking polyvalence of the narrative\u2014it extolled not only right-wing notions of authoritarian leadership but also more bi-partisan national values, such as salvaging something positive from war and defeat and self-affirmation in the face of crisis\u2014meant that Hindenburg\u2019s myth could be deployed by different groups, at different times, and for different purposes. Although promoted first and foremost by German nationalists, especially in Weimar\u2019s early years, some elements of the Hindenburg myth had considerable cross-party appeal. That his initiation as a mythical figure rested on national defence and a battle fought against the arch-enemy of German Social Democracy, Tsarist Russia, had endeared him to many on the moderate left from 1914 onwards.<ref>Anna Menge,  \"The Iron Hindenburg: a popular icon of Weimar Germany.\" German History 26.3 (2008): 357\u201382, quoting 358\u201359.</ref>}}\n\nThe famed [[zeppelin]] ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' that was [[Hindenburg disaster|destroyed by fire in 1937]] was named in his honor, as was the [[Hindenburgdamm]], a [[causeway]] joining the island of [[Sylt]] to mainland [[Schleswig-Holstein]] that was built during his time in office. The previously [[Province of Upper Silesia|Upper Silesian]] town of [[Zabrze]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Hindenburg O.S.}}) was also renamed after him in 1915, as well as the [[SMS Hindenburg|SMS ''Hindenburg'']], a [[battlecruiser]] commissioned in the Imperial German Navy in 1917 and the last capital ship to enter service in the Imperial Navy.  The [[Hindenburg Range]] in New Guinea, which includes perhaps one of the world's largest cliffs, the Hindenburg Wall, also bears his name.\n\nHistorian [[Christopher Clark]] has criticized Hindenburg in his role as head of state for:\n{{Quote|withdrawing his solemn constitutional oaths of 1925 and 1932 to make common cause with the sworn enemies of the Republic.  And then, having publicly declared that he would never consent to appoint Hitler to any post...levered the Nazi leader into the German Chancellery in January 1933.

He played a key role in the [[Nazi]] ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' in January 1933 when, under pressure from advisers, he appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] Chancellor of Germany.\n\nBorn to a family of minor Prussian nobility, Hindenburg joined the Prussian army in 1866 where he saw combat during the [[Austro-Prussian War|Austro-Prussian]] and [[Franco-Prussian War|Franco-Prussian]] wars. He retired with the rank of [[General of the Infantry]] in 1911, but was recalled to military service at the age of 66 following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914 and shortly thereafter received nationwide attention as the victor of the [[Battle of Tannenberg]].

As [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] increasingly delegated his authority to the [[Oberste Heeresleitung|Army High Command]], Hindenburg and his deputy, General [[Erich Ludendorff]], established a ''de facto'' military dictatorship that controlled Germany for the rest of the war.\n\nHindenburg retired again in 1919, but returned to public life in 1925 to be [[1925 German presidential election|elected]] the second President of Germany. He defeated Hitler in a runoff to [[1932 German presidential election|win reelection]] in 1932. He was opposed to Hitler and was a major player in the increasing political instability in the Weimar Republic that ended with Hitler's rise to power. He dissolved the Reichstag twice in 1932 and finally agreed to appoint Hitler [[Chancellor of Germany]] in January 1933. Hindenburg did this to satisfy Hitler's demands that he should play a part in the Weimar government, for Hitler was the leader of the [[Nazi party]], which had won a plurality in the November 1932 elections. In February he approved the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], which suspended various civil liberties, and in March signed the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], which gave Hitler's regime arbitrary powers. Hindenburg died the following year, after which Hitler declared himself ''[[F\u00fchrer|F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler]]'', or Supreme Leader and Chancellor, which superseded both the Presidency and Chancellorship.\n\n==Early life==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}<!--most unreferenced-->\n[[File:Wahlstatt Damals \u2013 PvH.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Paul von Hindenburg as a cadet in [[Wahlstatt]] (1860)]]\n[[File:Wapen von Benneckendorf und Hindenburg.svg|thumb|left|Coat of arms of the [[Uradel|ancient]] {{ill|von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg (noble family)|lt=von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg family|de|von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg}}]]\nPaul Ludwig Hans Anton von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg was born in Posen, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (Polish: [[Pozna\u0144]]; until [[Second Partition of Poland|1793]] and since [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918\u20131919)|1919]] part of [[Poland]]<ref>[http://mapa.szukacz.pl/?x=359424&y=506422&m=Pozna%f1&u=Podg%f3rna&w=wielkopolskie&p=Pozna%f1&g=Pozna%f1&z=0 Mapa.szukacz.pl \u2013 Mapa Polski z planami miast<!-- bot-generated title -->] at mapa.szukacz.pl</ref>), the son of [[Prussia]]n aristocrat Hans Robert Ludwig von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg (1816\u20131902) and his wife Luise Schwickart (1825\u20131893), the daughter of physician Karl Ludwig Schwickart and wife Julie Moennich. His paternal grandparents were Otto Ludwig Fady von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg (1778\u20131855), through whom he was remotely descended from the illegitimate daughter of [[Henry VI, Count of Waldeck|Count Heinrich VI of Waldeck]], and his wife Eleonore von Brederfady (d. 1863).{{Clarify|date=November 2017}} Hindenburg was also a direct descendant of [[Martin Luther]] and his wife [[Katharina von Bora]], through their daughter Margareta Luther. Hindenburg's younger brothers and sister were Otto (b. 1849), Ida (b. 1851) and Bernhard (b. 1859). One of his first-cousins was the great-grandmother of [[IKEA]] founder [[Ingvar Kamprad]]. His family were all [[Lutheran]] [[Protestants]] in the [[Prussian Union of churches|Evangelical Church of Prussia]], which since 1817 included both [[Calvinist]] and Lutheran parishioners.\n\nPaul was proud of his family and could trace ancestors back to 1289.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hindenburg|first1=Marshal von|title=Out of my life|date=1921|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|translator= F.

True to family tradition his father supported his family as an infantry officer; he retired as a major. In the summer they visited his grandfather at the Hindenburg estate of [[Ogrodzieniec, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Neudeck]] in [[East Prussia]]. At age 11 Paul entered the Cadet Corps School at [[Wahlstatt]] (now [[Legnickie Pole]], Poland). At 16 he was transferred to the School in Berlin, and at 18 he served as a page to [[Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria|the widow]] of King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]].

After weeks of marching, the Guards attacked [[Battle of Gravelotte|the village of Saint Privat]] (near Metz). Climbing a gentle slope, they came under heavy fire from the superior [[Chassepot|French rifles]]. After four hours the Prussian artillery came up to blast the French lines while the infantry, filled with the \"holy lust of battle\",<ref>Hindenburg, 1921, p. 46.</ref> swept through the French lines. His regiment suffered 1096 casualties, and he became regimental adjutant. The Guards were spectators at the [[Battle of Sedan]] and for the following months sat in the siege lines surrounding Paris.

He was promoted to captain in 1878 and assigned to the staff of the Second Army Corps. He married the intelligent and accomplished [[Gertrud von Hindenburg|Gertrud von Sperling (1860\u20131921)]] by whom he had two daughters, Irmengard Pauline (1880) and Annemaria (1891) and one son, [[Oskar von Hindenburg|Oskar]] (1883). Next, he commanded an infantry company, in which his men were ethnic [[Poles]].\n\nHe was transferred in 1885 to the [[German General Staff|General Staff]] and was promoted to major. His section was led by Count [[Alfred von Schlieffen]], a noted student of [[encirclement]] battles like [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], whose famous [[Schlieffen Plan]] proposed to pocket the French Army. For five years Hindenburg also taught tactics at the ''Kriegsakademie''. At the maneuvers of 1885, he met the future [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]]; they met again at the next year's war game in which Hindenburg commanded the \"[[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]]\". He learned the topography of the lakes and sand barrens of East Prussia during the annual Great General Staff's ride in 1888. The following year he moved to the War Ministry, to write the field service regulations on [[Military engineering|field-engineering]] and on the use of heavy artillery in field engagements; both were used during the First World War. He became a lieutenant-colonel in 1891, and two years later was promoted to colonel commanding an infantry regiment. He became chief of staff of the Eighth Army Corps in 1896.\n\n===Field commands and retirement===\nHindenburg was given command of a division in 1897 as a major-general (equivalent to a British and US brigadier general) in 1897; in 1900 he was promoted to lieutenant general (equivalent to major-general). Five years later he was made commander of the Fourth Army Corps based in Magdeburg as a [[General of the Infantry (Germany)|General of the Infantry]] (lieutenant-general; the German equivalent to four-star rank was Colonel-General).

Nevertheless, urged on by Ludendorff and Hoffman, Hindenburg spent the winter fighting for his strategy by badgering the Kaiser while his press officer recruited notables like the [[Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein|''Kaiserin'']] and the [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince]] to \u201cstab the kaiser in the back\u201d.<ref>M\u00fcller, 1961, p. 57.</ref> The kaiser compromised by keeping Falkenhayn in supreme command, but replacing him as Prussian war minister. In retaliation, Falkenhayn reassigned some of Hindenburg's forces to a new army group under [[Prince Leopold of Bavaria]] and transferring Ludendorff to a new joint German and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Southern Army. Hindenburg and Ludendorff reacted by threatening to resign thereby resulting in Ludendorff's reinstatement under Hindenburg's command.\n\n====Counterattacks in East Prussia & Poland====\n[[File:Von Hindenburg and his staff 1914.jpg|thumb|Hindenburg and his staff in 1914]]\n\nFollowing his return, Ludendorff provided Hindenburg with a depressing evaluation of their allies\u2019 army, which already had lost many of their professional officers<ref>Ludendorff, 1919, '''1''' pp. 134\u201338.</ref> and had been driven out of much of the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], their part of what once had been [[Partitions of Poland|Poland]]. Meanwhile, the Russians were inexorably pushing from Galicia toward Hungary through the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] passes. Under orders from Falkenhayn to contain the resurgent Russians, Hindenburg mounted an unsuccessful attack in Poland with his Ninth Army as well as an offensive by his newly formed [[10th Army (German Empire)|Tenth Army]] which made only local gains. Following these setbacks, he set up temporary headquarters at [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]], and made plans to eliminate the Russians' remaining toehold in East Prussia by ensnaring them in a [[pincer movement]] between the Tenth Army in the north and Eighth Army in the south. The attack was launched on 7 February whereby Hindenburg's forces encircled an entire corps and captured more than 100,000 men in the [[Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes]].\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian fortress city of [[Przemy\u015bl Fortress|Przemy\u015bl]] in Galicia, which had been [[Siege of Przemy\u015bl|besieged]] for months, surrendered on 23 March with the loss of 117,000 men. To drive the Russians out of the Carpathian passes the Austro-Hungarians proposed a joint strike on the Russian right flank. Falkenhayn agreed, so he moved ''OHL'' east to the castle of [[Pszczyna|Pless]] and formed Army Group [[August von Mackensen|von Mackensen]] from a new German [[11th Army (German Empire)|Eleventh Army]] and the Austro-Hungarian [[4th Army (Austria-Hungary)|Fourth Army]]. German heavy artillery was brought east: Mackensen had more than 200 heavy guns, while his foes had 4 {{mdash}}the Russian's heavy guns were immobilized in fortresses.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Golovine|first1=Nicholas N|title=The Russian army in the World War|date=1931|publisher=Oxford |page=220}}</ref> In April Mackensen broke through the Russian front between [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive|Gorlice and Tarn\u00f3w]]. For weeks he continued to steamroller forward, his entire front stepping forward shoulder to shoulder eastward across Galicia, his guns smashing through hastily constructed Russian lines. Hindenburg was to pressure the Russians in the north. He moved headquarters to [[Gi\u017cycko|L\u00f6tzen]], near the eastern boundary of East Prussia. Three cavalry divisions swept east into [[Courland]], the barren, sandy region near the Baltic coast, in one of the war's most successful cavalry actions. The cavalry's gains were held by Hindenburg's new [[Neman (river)|Nieman]] army, named after the river.\n\nIn June ''OHL'' ordered Hindenburg to attack frontally in Poland north of [[Warsaw]], steamrollering toward the [[Narew]] River. Ludendorff, furious with dictated tactics and because they were prohibited from pressing on in [[Courland]], sat on his hands.<ref>Hindenburg, 1921, '''1''', p. 174.</ref> Hindenburg created [[Army Group Gallwitz (1918)|Army Group Gallwitz]]{{mdash}}named after its commander{{mdash}}which when Berlin approved became [[12th Army (German Empire)|Twelfth Army]] (Von [[Max von Gallwitz|Gallwitz]] is one of many able commanders selected by Hindenburg), who stayed at the new army's headquarters to be available if needed.

However, steamroller frontal attacks cost dearly: by 20 August Gallwitz had lost 60,000 men.\n\n====Evacuation of Poland====\n[[File:Ernst Zimmer - Der Kaiser verleiht den Helden von Nowo-Georgiewsk das Eiserne Kreuz, 1915.jpg|thumb|The Emperor presents the [[Iron Cross]] to the Heroes of [[Siege of Novogeorgievsk|Novogeorgievsk]] (painting by Ernst Zimmer)]]\nAfter the Russians abandoned Warsaw, it was occupied on 5 August by a new ''OHL'' Army Group under [[Prince Leopold of Bavaria]]. Eighty thousand Russians remained in the great fortress that guarded the city, [[Siege of Novogeorgievsk|Novogeorgievsk]], expecting to hold out for months, but Falkenhayn brought up heavy artillery and they capitulated in days, losing 700 guns. Step by step the Russians withdrew from the [[Great Retreat (Russian)|Polish salient]]: scorching the earth and herding out a million inhabitants {{mdash}} Jews were treated especially harshly. Falkenhayn insisted on a head-on pursuit of the retreating Russians into Lithuania, according to Hindenburg \u201ca pursuit in which the pursuer gets more exhausted than the pursued\u201d.<ref>Hindenburg, 1921, '''1 ''' p. 175.</ref> He wanted to do more than push them back.

It fell on 17 August, along with 1,300 guns and almost 1 million shells. On 5 August his forces were consolidated into Army Group Hindenburg, which took the city of [[Grodno]] after bitter street fighting, but the retreating defenders could not be trapped because the wretched rail lines lacked the capacity to bring up the needed men. They occupied [[Vilnus]] on 18 September, then halted on ground favorable for a defensive line.\n\nOn 7 October Austro-Hungarian and German troops in Army Group Mackensen [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|invaded]] [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], capturing [[Belgrade]], and then eastern Serbia was invaded by the [[Bulgaria during World War I|Bulgarians]], who were promised substantial territorial gains; they had fine men but had lost many officers in the [[Balkan Wars]]. Falkenhayn had rejected advice that the Bulgarians should attack further south, to try to encircle the Serbs. By 4 December the remaining Serbian troops had escaped into [[Albania during World War I|Albania]].\n\nIn October Hindenburg moved headquarters to Kovno. They were responsible for 108,800&nbsp;km{{sup|2}} (42,000&nbsp;mi{{sup|2}}) of conquered Russian territory, which was home to three million people and became known as ''[[Ober Ost]]''. The troops built fortifications on the eastern border while Ludendorff \u201cwith his ruthless energy\u201d<ref>Hindenburg, 1921, '''1''', p. 182.</ref> headed the civil government, using forced labor to repair the war damages and to dispatch useful products, like hogs, to Germany.

They were equipped with three million rifles, 6,000 machine guns, and 6,356 pieces of field artillery.<ref>Lincoln, 1986, pp. 241\u201342.</ref> Now 66 German battalions faced 400 Russian, who attacked on 18 March near [[Lake Naroch Offensive|Lake Naroch]], bombarding with 982 guns each stocked with 1,000 shells. Their infantry advanced despite heavy snow on the date promised to their allies, day after day failing to breach the defenses, while the battlefield thawed into a marsh in which they lost nearly 100,000 soldiers.\n\nThe next Russian onslaughts were along {{convert|480|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the southwestern front in present-day [[western Ukraine]]. Four armies commanded by General [[Aleksei Brusilov]] on 4 June [[Brusilov Offensive|attacked]] entrenchments that the Austro-Hungarians regarded as impregnable.<ref>Lincoln, 1986, pp. 238\u201360.</ref> Probing assault troops located three weak spots which then were struck in force. In nine days they captured more than 200,000 men and 200 guns, and pushed into open country. Austro-Hungarian troops were rushed back from the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. Every man was needed in the west, so German troops on the Eastern Front had to be shifted south to plug the gap. Then on 19 June the Russians struck further north near [[Kovel]] on a front of {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} defended by Austro-Hungarian and German troops, beginning with a bombardment from 1,000 guns. ''Ober Ost'' desperately shored up weak points with defenders stripped from less threatened positions. Ludendorff was so distraught on the phone to ''OHL'' that General [[Wilhelm Groener]] (who directed the army's railroads and had been a competitor with Ludendorff on the General Staff) was sent to evaluate his nerves, which were judged satisfactory.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Asprey|first1=Robert|title=The German High Command at War: Hindenburg and Ludendorff conduct World War I|url=https://archive.org/details/germanhighcomman00aspr|url-access=registration|date=1991|publisher=William Morrow|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/germanhighcomman00aspr/page/188 188]}}</ref> For a week the Russians kept attacking: they lost 80,000 men; the defenders 16,000. On 16 July the Russians attacked the German lines west of Riga, where again they were thwarted by a stout defense.\n\n====Commander of the Eastern Front====\nOn 27 July the Austro-Hungarians accepted Hindenburg as the commander of the Eastern Front (except for the Archdukes Karl's Army Group in southeast Galicia, in which the German [[Hans von Seeckt]] was chief of staff). General von Eichhorn took over Army Group Hindenburg, while Hindenburg and Ludendorff, on a staff train equipped with the most advanced communication apparatus, visited their new forces. At threatened points they formed mixed German and Austro-Hungarian units and other Austro-Hungarian formations were bolstered by a sprinkling of German officers. The derelict citadel of the [[Brest Fortress]] was refurbished as their headquarters. Their front was almost {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} and their only reserves were a cavalry brigade plus some artillery and machine gunners.<ref>Ludendorff, '''1''', 1919, p. 275.</ref> The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] sent a corps to reinforce the German Southern Army, which had to hold Galicia because it was a major source of petroleum. The Russians then struck on Brusilov's right with their best troops, the [[Russian Guards|Guards Army]], and the heaviest artillery concentration yet seen on the Eastern Front. Their military maps were sketchy, because they had never planned to fight so deep in their own territory, so the Guards were sent to advance through a swamp; in a week they lost 80 percent of their men. Further south Brusilov did better, penetrating a few kilometers into Hungary, but when the front stabilized the Russians faced new fortifications dug and wired on the German pattern. Officers were exchanged between the German and Austro-Hungarian armies for training.\n\n====Supreme commander====\n[[File:Vogel drawing.jpg|thumb|left|Hindenburg drawn by his friend Hugo Vogel|upright=0.8]]\n\nIn the west, the Germans were hemorrhaging in the battles of [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] and the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]]. Influential ''OHL'' officers, led by the artillery expert Lieutenant Colonel [[Max Bauer]], a friend of Ludendorff's, lobbied against Falkenhayn, deploring his futile steamroller at Verdun and his inflexible defense along the Somme, where he packed troops into the front-line to be battered by the hail of shells and sacked commanders who lost their front-line trench. German leaders contrasted Falkenhayn's bludgeon with Hindenburg's deft parrying.<ref>M\u00fcller, 1961, p. 109.</ref>\nThe tipping point came after Falkenhayn ordered a Bulgarian spoiling attack on the Entente lines in [[Macedonian front|Macedonia]], which failed with heavy losses. Thus emboldened, [[Romania during World War I|Romania]] declared war against Austro-Hungary on 27 August, adding 650,000 trained enemies who invaded Hungarian [[Transylvania]]. Falkenhayn had been adamant that Romania would remain neutral. During the Kaiser's deliberations about who should command Falkenhayn said \u201cWell, if the Herr Field Marshall has the desire and the courage to take the post\u201d. Hindenburg replied \u201cThe desire, no, but the courage\u2014yes\u201d.<ref>M\u00fcller, 1961, p. 188.</ref> Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg favored Hindenburg, supposing him amenable to moderate peace terms,<ref>M\u00fcller, 1961, p. 187.</ref> mistaking his amiability as tractability and unaware that he was intent on enlarging Prussia.\n\nHindenburg was summoned to Pless on 29 August where he was named Chief of the General Staff. Ludendorff demanded joint responsibility for all decisions\u201d;<ref>Ludendorff 1919, '''1''', p. 283.</ref> Hindenburg did not demur. Henceforth, Ludendorff became the public face of ''OHL'': signing most orders, directives and the daily press reports. The eastern front was commanded by Leopold of Bavaria, with Hoffmann as his chief of staff. Hindenburg was also appointed as Supreme War Commander of the armies of the Central Powers, with nominal control of six million men. The British were unimpressed: General Charteris, Haig's intelligence chief, wrote to his wife \u201cpoor old Hindenburg is sixty-four years of age, and will not do very much.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beach|first1=Jim|title=Haig's intelligence.

The Entente supported Romania by attacking from [[Macedonian front|Macedonia]], but were repelled. Mackensen seized the Romanian forts on the right bank of the Danube, while infantry and cavalry from the Western Front reinforced the Ninth Army in Hungarian [[Transylvania]], which now was commanded by [[Erich von Falkenhayn|Falkenhayn]] (another of Hindenburg's prudent selections). In a month, he defeated the Romanian invaders at [[Sibiu|Hermannstadt]] and then in November thrust into Romania through passes in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], while Mackensen crossed the Danube to cut off their retreat, but the Romanians moved swiftly, they and their Russian reinforcements formed a defensive line in [[Moldavia|Moldova]] after Bucharest fell on 6 December 1916. [[John Norton-Griffiths|British saboteurs]] had time enough to burn the oil stores and to plug most of the wells. During the last months of the year the Russians continued vain assaults in Ukraine. In 1916 there were three Russian casualties on the Eastern Front for every two from the Central Powers and Russian morale was crumbling: \u201cMore than a dozen Russian regiments mutinied in the last weeks of 1916.\u201d<ref>Lincoln, 1986, p. 259.</ref> About 12% of the German casualties that year were on the Eastern Front. In the autumn, the Entente began to push the Bulgarians back in Macedonia. On 11 October Army Group Otto von Below was formed there from the Bulgarians, twenty German battalions and an Ottoman corps; their new line held.\n\n====Bolstering defense====\n''OHL'' issued a Textbook of Defensive Warfare that recommended fewer defenders in the front line relying on light machine guns, if pushed too hard they were permitted to pull back. Attackers who penetrated the front line entered a battle zone, in which they were machine gunned from scattered emplacements and shelled by the German artillery, who knew the ranges and location of their own strong points. Then infantry counterattacked, while the attacker's artillery was blind because they were unsure where their own men were. A reserve division was positioned immediately behind the line, if it entered the battle it was commanded by the division whose position had been penetrated. (Mobile defense was also used in World War II.) Responsibilities were reassigned to implement the new tactics: front-line commanders took over reserves ordered into the battle and for flexibility infantry platoons were subdivided into eight man units under a noncom.\n\nField officers who visited headquarters often were invited to speak with Hindenburg, who inquired about their problems and recommendations. At this time he was especially curious about the eight man units,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Papen|first1=Franz von|title=Memoirs|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirs0000pape|url-access=registration|date=1952|publisher=A.

Major goals included a new light machine gun, updated artillery, and motor transport, but no tanks because they considered them too vulnerable to artillery.

Hindenburg also wanted the universities closed, except for medical training, so that empty places would not be filled by women. To swell the next generation of soldiers he wanted contraceptives banned and bachelors taxed.<ref>Asprey, 1991, p. 340.</ref> When a Polish army was being formed he wanted Jews excluded.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kitchen|first1=Martin|title=The Silent Dictatorship.

At the funeral Hindenburg met his successor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles]], who was frank about hoping to stop fighting. Hindenburg's Eastern Front ran south from the Baltic to the Black Sea through what now are the Baltic States, Ukraine, and Romania. In Italy, the line ran from the Swiss border on the west to the Adriatic east of Venice. The Macedonian front extended along the Greek border from the Adriatic to the Aegean. The line contested by the Russians and Ottomans between the Black and [[Caspian Sea]] ran along the heights of the [[Caucasus]] mountains. He urged the Ottomans to pull their men off the heights before winter, but they did not, he believed this was because of their \"policy of massacre of the Armenians\"<ref>Hindenburg, 1921,'''2''', p. 16.</ref> and many froze. The front in Palestine ran from the Mediterranean to the southern end of the Dead Sea, and the defenders of [[Mesopotamian campaign|Baghdad]] had a flank on the Tigris River. The Western Front ran southward from Belgium until near Laon, where it turned east to pass Verdun before again turning south to end at the Swiss Border. The remaining German enclaves in [[East African Campaign (World War I)|Africa]] were beyond his reach; an attempt to resupply them by [[LZ 104 (L 59)|dirigible]] failed. The Central Powers were surrounded and outnumbered.\n\n===1917===\n[[File:Hindenburg and ludendorff.jpg|thumb|Hindenburg and Ludendorff|upright=0.9]]\n\n====Submarine warfare====\nStrengthening their army would take time: by the second quarter of 1917 the field army would have 680,000 more men in 53 new divisions<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reichsarkive|title=Der Weltkrieg 1914 bis 1918|date=1942|publisher=Mittler|location=Berlin|volume=13}}</ref> and the supply of the new [[MG 08|light machine guns]] would be adequate. Field guns would have increased from 5,300 to 6,700 and heavies from 3,700 to 4,340. They tried to foster fighting spirit by 'patriotic instruction\u2019 with lectures and films<ref>Kitchen, 1976, p. 58.</ref> to \u201censure that a fight is kept up against all agitators, croakers and weaklings\u201d.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Binding|first1=Rudolf|title=A fatalist at war|date=1929|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|page=183}}</ref> Meanwhile, they were sure to be attacked before their buildup was complete. In the interim the pressure might be reduced if the [[Imperial German Navy|Navy]] waged [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], which they claimed would defeat the British in six months. The chancellor and his camp were opposed, not wanting to bring the United States and other neutrals into the war. After securing the Dutch and Danish borders, Hindenburg announced that unrestricted submarine warfare was imperative and Ludendorff added his voice. On 9 January the chancellor bowed to their unsound military judgments: underrating the United States and overrating their own navy.\n\n''OHL'' moved west to the pleasant spa town of [[Bad Kreuznach]] in southwest Germany, which was on a main rail line. The Kaiser's quarters were in the spa building, staff offices were in the orange court, and the others lived in the hotel buildings. In February a third Army Group was formed on the Western Front to cover the front in Alsace-Lorraine, it was commanded by Archduke Albrecht of W\u00fcrttemberg. Some effective divisions from the east were exchanged for less competent divisions from the west. Since their disasters of the previous year the Russian infantry had shown no fight and in March the [[February Revolution|revolution]] erupted in Russia. Shunning opportunity, the Central Powers stayed put {{mdash}} Hindenburg feared that invaders would resurrect the heroic resistance of [[French invasion of Russia|1812]].\n\n====The great withdrawal and defending the Western Front====\nOn the Western Front their huge salient between the valley of the Somme and Laon obviously was vulnerable to a pincer attack, which indeed the French were planning. The new Hindenburg line ran across its base. On 16 March they began [[Operation Alberich]]: moving out able-bodied inhabitants and portable possessions, destroying every building, all roads and bridges, cutting down every tree, fouling every well, and burning every combustible. In 39 days the Germans withdrew from a 1000&nbsp;mi\u00b2 (2,590&nbsp;km\u00b2) area, more ground than they had lost to all Allied offensives since 1914.<ref>Herwig, 1997, p. 252.</ref> The cautiously following Allies also had to cope with booby traps, some exploding a month later. The new front was {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}} shorter freeing-up 14 German divisions.\n\nOn 9 April the British attacked. At [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras]] led by tanks and a creeping barrage, they took the German first and second lines and occupied part of their third while the Canadians swept the Germans completely off the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge.]]. There was consternation at ''OHL'', their new defense had failed. It was Ludendorff's birthday but he refused to come to the celebratory dinner. Hindenburg \u201cpressed the hand of my First Quartermaster-General with the words, \u2018We have lived through more critical times than to-day together\u2019\u201d<ref>Hindenburg, '''2''', p. 58.</ref> The British tried to exploit their opening with a futile cavalry charge but did not press further, because their attack was a diversion for coming French operations. In fact, their new defensive tactics had not been tested, because Sixth Army commander [[Ludwig von Falkenhausen]] had packed men in the front line and kept counterattack divisions too far back. He was replaced.\n\nA week later the anticipated French [[Nivelle Offensive|offensive]] began, driving northward from the [[Second Battle of the Aisne|Aisne River]], after six days of intensive shelling their infantry was led forward by 128 tanks, the first attack by massed tanks.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=David|title=Breaking point of the French army : the Nivelle offensive of 1917|date=2015|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|location=Barnsley}}</ref> [[Robert Nivelle|Nivelle]] knew that the Germans had captured his detailed plans several weeks before, but followed them nonetheless. The first two German lines were taken at heavy cost and the French slowly advanced {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} as the defense fell back to their main line of resistance {{mdash}} it was far from Nivelle's promise of a first day's advance of {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The attacks ended in early May when many French regiments refused to attack. The Germans never learned the extent of their enemy's [[French Army Mutinies|demoralization]]. Nivelle was replaced by P\u00e9tain.\n\n====The Ottoman and Eastern Fronts====\nThe British captured Baghdad on 11 March. The Ottomans had been promised that their empire would be defended, so all their troops in Europe returned home and in May Falkenhayn was appointed to command Army group F comprising two Ottoman armies along with three German infantry battalions with some artillery; to impress the enemy it was called The Asiatic Corps. Falkenhayn realized it would be difficult to retake Baghdad, so he took over the defense of the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Gaza line]] in Palestine, which the British broke through in November. To spare the city ''OHL'' ordered him not to defend Jerusalem, which was occupied in December.\n\nThe revolutionary Russian government led by [[Alexander Kerensky]] remained at war, [[Kerensky Offensive|attacking]] and pushing back the Austro-Hungarians in Galicia on 1 July. To counter this success, on 18 July after a [[hurricane bombardment]] by 136 batteries directed by Bruchm\u00fcller a ''Schwerpunkt'' of six German divisions from the west broke a gap in the Russian front, through which they sliced southward toward [[Ternopil|Tarnopol]], thereby threatening to pocket the Russian attackers, who fled to save themselves; many of the demoralized Russian units elected committees to replaced their officers. At the end of August the advancing Central Powers stopped at the frontier of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]]. To keep up the pressure and to seize ground he intended to keep, Hindenburg shifted north to the heavily fortified city of Riga (today in Latvia) which has the broad [[Daugava|Dvina River]] as a moat. On 1 September the Eighth Army, led by [[Oskar von Hutier]], attacked; Bruchm\u00fcller's bombardment, which included gas and smoke shells, drove the defenders from the far bank east of the city, the Germans crossed in barges and then bridged the river, immediately pressing forward to the Baltic coast, pocketing the defenders of the [[Battle of Jugla|Riga salient]]. Next a joint operation with the navy seized [[Saaremaa|Oesel]] and two smaller islands in the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga|Gulf of Riga]]. The [[October Revolution|Bolshevik revolution]] took Russia out of the war, an armistice was signed on 16 December.\n\n====The Reichstag peace resolution====\n[[File:H & K.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiser Wilhelm II and Hindenburg|upright=0.8]]\n\nHindenburg detested Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg for dragging his feet about total and submarine warfare. Then in July the chancellor permitted the Reichstag to debate a [[Reichstag Peace Resolution|resolution]] for peace without \u201cannexations or indemnities\u201d. Colonel Bauer and the Crown Prince rushed to Berlin to block this peril. The minister of war urged Hindenburg and Ludendorff to join them, but when they arrived the kaiser told them that \u201cthere could be no justification for their presence in Berlin\u201d. They should \u201creturn in haste to Headquarters where they certainly would be much better occupied.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=De Gaulle|first1=Charles|title=The Enemy's House Divided|url=https://archive.org/details/enemyshousedivid00gaul|url-access=registration|date=2002|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=[https://archive.org/details/enemyshousedivid00gaul/page/103 103\u201304]}}</ref> They returned as ordered and then immediately telegraphed their resignations, which the kaiser declined. The crisis was resolved when the monarchist parties voted no confidence in Bethmann-Hollweg, who resigned. Ludendorff and Bauer wanted to replace both the kaiser and chancellor by a dictator, but Hindenburg would not agree.<ref>Bauer, 1922, p. 159.</ref> Many historians believe that in fact Ludendorff assumed that role.{{citation needed, clarify}} The Reichstag passed a modified resolution calling for \u201cconciliation\u201d on 19 July, which the new chancellor [[Georg Michaelis]] agreed to \"interpret\".\n\nThe resolution became advantageous in August when the Pope called for peace. The German response cited the resolution to finesse specific questions like those about the future of Belgium. The industrialists opposed Groener's advocacy of an excess profits tax and insistence that workers take a part in company management.<ref>Kitchen, 1976, p. 144.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Chickering|first1=Roger|title=Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914\u20131918|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialgermany00roge|url-access=registration|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=[https://archive.org/details/imperialgermany00roge/page/81 81]}}</ref> Ludendorff relieved Groener by telegram and sent him off to command a division.\n\nHindenburg's 70th birthday was celebrated lavishly all over Germany, 2 October was a public holiday, an honor that until then had been reserved only for the Kaiser.<ref>Astore and Showalter, 2005, p. 51.</ref> Hindenburg published a birthday manifesto, which ended with the words:\n{{quote|With God's help our German strength has withstood the tremendous attack of our enemies, because we were one, because each gave his all gladly. So it must stay to the end. \u2018Now thank we all our God\u2019 on the bloody battlefield! Take no thought for what is to be after the war! This only brings despondency into our ranks and strengthens the hopes of the enemy. Trust that Germany will achieve what she needs to stand there safe for all time, trust that the German oak will be given air and light for its free growth. Muscles tensed, nerves steeled, eyes front! We see before us the aim: Germany honored, free and great! God will be with us to the end!\"<ref>Astore and Showalter, 2005, pp. 51\u201352.</ref>}}\n\n====Victory in Italy====\nBavarian mountain warfare expert [[Konrad Krafft von Dellmensingen|von Dellmensingen]] was sent to assess the Austro-Hungarian defenses in Italy, which he found poor. Then he scouted for a site from which an attack could be mounted against the Italians. Hindenburg created a new Fourteenth Army with ten Austro-Hungarian and seven German divisions and enough airplanes to control the air, commanded by [[Otto von Below]]. The attackers slipped undetected into the mountains opposite to the opening of the [[So\u010da]] valley. The [[Battle of Caporetto|attack]] began during the night when the defender's trenches in the valley were abruptly shrouded in a dense cloud of poison gas released from 894 canisters fired simultaneously from simple mortars. The defenders fled before their masks would fail. The artillery opened fire several hours later, hitting the Italian reinforcements hastening up to fill the gap. The attackers swept over the almost empty defenses and marched through the pass, while mountain troops cleared the heights on either side. The Italians fled west, too fast to be cut off. Entente divisions were rushed to Italy to stem the retreat by holding a line on the Piave River. Below's Army was dissolved and the German divisions returned to the Western Front, where in October P\u00e9tain had directed a successful limited objective attack in which six days of carefully planned bombardment left crater-free pathways for 68 tanks to lead the infantry forward on the Lassaux plateau south of Laon, which forced the Germans off of the entire ridge {{mdash}} the French Army had recovered.\n\n====The treaty with Russia====\nIn the negotiations with the Soviet Government, Hindenburg wanted to retain control of all Russian territory that the Central Powers occupied, with German grand dukes ruling [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)|Courland]] and [[Kingdom of Lithuania (1918)|Lithuania]], as well as a large slice of [[Kingdom of Poland (1917\u20131918)|Poland]]. Their Polish plan was opposed by Foreign Minister [[Richard von K\u00fchlmann]], who encouraged the kaiser to listen to the views of Max Hoffmann, chief of staff on the Eastern Front. Hoffmann demurred but when ordered argued that it would be a mistake bring so many Slavs into Germany, when only a small slice of Poland was needed to improve defenses. Ludendorff was outraged that the kaiser had consulted a subordinate, while Hindenburg complained that the kaiser \u201cdisregards our opinion in a matter of vital importance.\u201d<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, 1967, p. 131.</ref> The kaiser backed off, but would not approve Ludendorff's order removing Hoffmann, who is not even mentioned in Hindenburg's memoir. When the Soviets refused the terms offered at [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] the Germans repudiated the armistice and in a week [[Operation Faustschlag|occupied]] the Baltic States, [[Belarus]] and Ukraine, which had signed the treaty as a separate entity. Now the Russians signed also. Hindenburg helped to force K\u00fchlmann out in July 1918.\n\n===1918===\nIn January more than half a million workers went on strike, among their demands was a peace without annexations. The strike collapsed when its leaders were arrested, the labor press suppressed, strikers in the reserve called for active duty, and seven great industrial concerns were taken under military control, which put their workers under martial law.<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, 1967, p. 142.</ref> On 16 January Hindenburg demanded the replacement of Count von Valentini, the chief of the Civil Cabinet. The Kaiser bridled \u201cI do not need your parental advice\u201d,<ref>Lee, 2005, p. 148.</ref> but nonetheless fired his old friend. The Germans were unable to tender a plausible peace offer because ''OHL'' insisted on controlling Belgium and retaining the French coalfields. All of the Central Power's cities were on the brink of starvation and their armies were on short rations, Hindenburg realized that \"empty stomachs prejudiced all higher impulses and tended to make men indifferent.\u201d<ref>Hindenburg, 1921, '''2''', p. 118</ref> He blamed his allies' hunger on poor organization and transportation, not realizing that the Germans would have enough to eat if they collected their harvest efficiently and rationed its distribution effectively.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Van der Kloot|first1=W.|title=Ernest Starling's analysis of the energy balance of the German people during the blockade, 1914\u20131919|journal=Notes Rec.

Hundreds of thousands of men were needed to hold and police these conquests. More Germans were in Macedonia and in Palestine, where the British were driving north; Falkenhayn was replaced by [[Otto Liman von Sanders]], who had led the defense of [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. All Hindenburg required was that these fronts stand firm while the Germans won in the west, where now they outnumbered their opponents. He firmly believed that his opponents could be crushed by battlefield defeats regardless of their far superior resources.\n\nOffensive tactics were tailored to the defense. Their opponents were adopting defense in depth. He would attack the British because they were less skillful than the French.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sixsmith|first1=Major General E. K.

However, winter mud prevented action there until April. Consequently, their first attack, named Michael, was on the southern part of the British line, at a projecting British salient near Saint-Quentin. ''Schwerpunkts'' would hit on either side of the salient's apex to pocket its defenders, the V Corps, as an overwhelming display of German power.\n\nAdditional troops and skilled commanders, like von Hutier, were shifted from the east, Army Group von Gallwitz was formed in the west on 1 February. One quarter of the western divisions were designated for attack; to counter the elastic defense during the winter each of them attended a four-week course on infiltration tactics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Historical Section, General Staff|title=A survey of German Tactics 1918|date=1918|publisher=The Base Printing Plant. 29th Engineers, U. S. Army}}</ref> Storm troops would slip through weak points in the front line and slice through the battle zone, bypassing strong points that would be mopped up by the mortars, flamethrowers and manhandled field guns of the next wave. As always surprise was essential, so the artillery was slipped into attack positions at night, relying on camouflage for concealment; the British aerial photographers were allowed free rein before D-day. There would be no preliminary registration fire, the gunners were trained for map firing in schools established by Bruchm\u00fcller. In the short, intense bombardment each gun fired in a precise sequence, shifting back and forth between different targets, using many gas shells to keep defenders immersed in a toxic cloud. On D-day, the air force would establish air supremacy and machine gun enemy strong points, also updating commanders on how far the attackers had penetrated. Signal lamps were used for messaging on the ground. Headquarters moved close to the front and as soon as possible would advance to pre-selected positions in newly occupied ground. ''OHL'' moved to [[Spa, Belgium]] while Hindenburg and Ludendorff were closer to the attack at [[Avesnes-l\u00e8s-Bapaume|Avesnes, France]], which re-awoke his memories of occupied France 41 years before.<ref>Hindenburg, 1921, '''2''', p. 153.</ref>\n\n====Breaking the trench stalemate====\n[[Operation Michael]] struck on 21 March. The first day's reports were inconclusive, but by day two they knew they had broken through some of the enemy artillery lines. But the encirclement failed because British stoutness gave V Corps time to slip out of the targeted salient. On day four they were moving on into open country when the kaiser prematurely celebrated by pinning the [[iron cross]] with sun's rays on Hindenburg's tunic, the first recipient since the medal was created for [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|von Bl\u00fccher]].<ref>Wheeller-Bennett, 1936, p. 149.</ref> As usual Hindenburg set objectives as the situation evolved. South of the salient they had almost destroyed the British Fifth Army, so they pushed west to cut between the French and British Armies, but did not succeed because they advanced too slowly through the thrashed terrain of the former Somme battlefields and the ground devastated when withdrawing the year before and because troops stopped to loot food and clothing {{mdash}} hence they never broke through the Entente's fluid defensive line, manned by troops brought up and supplied by rail and motor transport. Then he hoped to get close enough to [[Amiens]] to bombard the railways with heavy artillery {{mdash}} they were stopped just short, after having advanced a maximum of {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Hindenburg also hoped that civilian morale would crumble because Paris was being shelled from by [[Paris Gun|naval guns]] mounted on rail carriages {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}} away, but he underestimated French resiliency.\n\nThe Allied command was dismayed. French headquarters realized: \"This much became clear from the terrible adventure, that our enemies were masters of a new method of warfare. ... What was even more serious was that it was perceived that the enemy's power was due to a thing that cannot be improvised, the training of officers and men.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=de Pierrefeu|first1=Jean|title=French Headquarters 1915\u20131918|url=https://archive.org/details/frenchheadquarte00pieruoft|date=1924|publisher=Geoffrey Bles|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/frenchheadquarte00pieruoft/page/247 247]|translator=Major C. J. C. Street}}</ref>\n\nProlonging Michael with the drive west delayed and weakened the attack in [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Flanders]]. Again they broke through, smashing the Portuguese defenders and forcing the British from all of the ground they had paid so dearly for in 1917. However, French support enabled the British to save [[Hazebrouck]], the rail junction that was the German goal. To draw the French reserves away from Flanders, the next attack was along the [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Aisne River]] where Nivelle had attacked the year before. Their success was dazzling. The defender's front was immersed in a gas cloud fired from simple mortars,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zabecki|first1=David T.|title=The German 1918 Offensives : A case study in the operational level of war|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=209}}</ref> within hours they had reoccupied all the ground the French had taken by weeks of grinding, and they continued to sweep south through Champagne until they halted for resupply at the [[Marne (river)|Marne River]].\n\nHindenburg had lost 977,555 of his best men between March and the end of July, while their foe's ranks were swelling with Americans. His dwindling stock of horses were on the verge of starvation and his ragged men thought continually of food. One of the most effective propaganda handbills the British showered on the German lines listed the rations received by prisoners of war. His troops bridled at their officer's rations and reports of the ample meals at headquarters, in his memoirs Ludendorff devotes six pages to defending officer's rations and perks.<ref>Ludendorff, 1919, pp. 286\u201392.</ref> After an attack the survivors needed at least six weeks to recuperate, but now crack divisions were recommitted much sooner. Tens of thousands of men were skulking behind the lines. Determined to win, he decided to expand the salient pointing toward Paris to strip more defenders from Flanders. The attack on [[Henri Gouraud (general)|General Henri Gouraud's]] French Fourth Army followed the now familiar scenario but was met by a deceptive elastic defense and was decisively repelled at the French main line of resistance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gudmundsson|first1=Bruce I.|title=On artillery|date=1993|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|pages=95\u2013102}}</ref> Hindenburg still intended to try the conclusive strike in Flanders, but before he could strike French and Americans led by light tanks smashed through the right flank of the German salient on the [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Marne]]. The German defense was halfhearted.They had lost. Hindenburg went on the defensive, withdrawing one by one from the salients created by their victories, evacuating their wounded and supplies and retiring to shortened lines. He hoped to hold a line until their enemies were ready to bargain.\n\n====Ludendorff's breakdown====\n[[File:Hindenburg and Ludendorff.jpg|thumb|Hindenburg and Ludendorff in 1918]]\nSince their retreat from the Marne, Ludendorff had been distraught, shrieking orders and often in tears. At dinner on 19 July he responded to a suggestion of Hindenburg's by shouting \"I have already told you that is impossible\u201d {{mdash}} Hindenburg led him from the room.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parkinson|first1=Roger|title=Tormented warrior, Ludendorff and the supreme Command|url=https://archive.org/details/tormentedwarrior0000park|url-access=registration|date=1978|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/tormentedwarrior0000park/page/167 167]}}</ref> On 8 August the British completely surprised them with a well-coordinated attack at [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]], breaking well into the German lines. Most disquieting was that some German commanders surrendered their units and that reserves arriving at the front were taunted for prolonging the war. For Ludendorff Amiens was the \"black day in the history of the German Army\".<ref>Ludendorff, 1919 '''2''' p. 326.</ref> Bauer and others wanted Ludendorff replaced, but Hindenburg stuck by his friend, he knew that \u201cMany a time has the soldier's calling exhausted strong characters\".<ref>Hindenburg,1921, '''2''', p. 126.</ref> A sympathetic physician who was a friend of Ludendorff's persuaded him to leave headquarters temporarily to recuperate. (His breakdown is not mentioned in Hindenburg's or Ludendorff's memoirs.) On 12 August Army Group von Boehn was created to firm up the defenses in the Somme sector. On 29 September Hindenburg and Ludendorff told the incredulous kaiser that the war was lost and that they must have an immediate armistice.\n\n====Defeat and revolution====\nA new chancellor, [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]], opened negotiations with President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who would deal only with a democratic Germany. Prince Max told the kaiser that he would resign unless Ludendorff was dismissed, but that Hindenburg was indispensable to hold the army together. On 26 October the Kaiser slated Ludendorff before curtly accepting his resignation {{mdash}} then rejecting Hindenburg's. Afterwards, Ludendorff refused to share Hindenburg's limousine.<ref>M\u00fcller, 1961, p. 413.</ref> Colonel [[Max Bauer|Bauer]] was retired. Hindenburg promptly replaced Ludendorff with Groener, now chief of staff of [[Army Group Mackensen (Poland)|Army Group Kiev]], which was assisting a breakaway [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainian government]] to fend off the Bolsheviks while expropriating food and oil.\n\nThey were losing their allies. In June the Austro-Hungarians in Italy attacked the Entente lines along the [[Second Battle of the Piave River|Piave River]] but were repelled decisively. On 24 October the Italians crossed the river in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]], after a few days of resolute resistance the defense collapsed, weakened by the defection of men from the empire's subject nations and starvation: the men in their Sixth Army had an average weight of {{convert|120|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref>Herwig, 1997, p. 434.</ref> On 14 October The Austro-Hungarians asked for an armistice in Italy, but the fighting went on. In September the Entente and their Greek allies [[Vardar Offensive|attacked]] in Macedonia. The Bulgarians begged for more Germans to stiffen their troops, but Hindenburg had none to spare. Many Bulgarian soldiers deserted as they retreated toward home, opening the road to Constantinople. The Austro-Hungarians were pushed back [[Liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)|in Serbia, Albania and Montenegro]], signing an armistice on 3 November. The Ottomans were overextended, trying to defend Syria while exploiting the Russian collapse to move into the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus]], advancing through Armenia and Georgia intending to take over Muslim lands, despite Hindenburg's urging them to defend what they had. The British and Arabs [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|broke]] through in September, capturing Damascus. The [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed on 30 October.\n\nWilson insisted that the kaiser must go, but he refused to abdicate, he was determined to lead the Prussian Army home to suppress the growing [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|rebellion]], which had started with large demonstrations in major cities and then, when the navy ordered a sortie to battle the British, mutineers led by workers' and soldiers' councils took control of the navy, these councils spread rapidly throughout Germany. They stripped officers of their badges of rank and decorations, if necessary forcibly. On 8 November Hindenburg told the kaiser that 39 regimental officers had been brought to Spa; where he delivered a situation report and answered questions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stephenson|first1=Scott|title=The Final Battle.

The answers were decisive: the army would not. The kaiser gave in, superfluously because in Berlin Prince Max had already publicly announced his abdication, his own resignation, and that the Social Democrat leader [[Friedrich Ebert]] was now chancellor. Democracy came abruptly and almost bloodlessly. That evening Groener telephoned Ebert, who he knew and trusted, to tell him that if the new government would fight Bolshevism and support the Army then the field marshal would lead a disciplined army home.<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, 1935, pp. 207\u201308.</ref> Hindenburg's remaining in command bolstered the new government's position.\n\n[[File:Bristoler Stra\u00dfe 6 Ecke Ludwig-Barney-Stra\u00dfe Hannover-Zoo Hindenburg-Villa Hindenburgviertel Emil Lorenz 1906 Paul von Hindenburg Fritz-Behrens-Stiftung.jpg|thumb|The Hindenburg villa in [[Hanover]]|upright=1.5]]\n\nThe withdrawal became more fraught when the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]] obliged all German troops to leave Belgium, France and [[Alsace-Lorraine|Alsace Lorraine]] in 14 days and to be behind the Rhine in 30 days. Stragglers would become prisoners. When the seven men from the executive committee of the soldiers' council formed at Spa arrived at ''OHL'' they were greeted politely by a lieutenant colonel, who acknowledged their leadership.

I assumed it was over the situation at the Seventh Army.  In any case as soon as I entered the field marshall asked me  to give my assessment of the situation at the Seventh Army.    I described it in short terms and emphasized especially that based on my own observations I thought the condition of the troops was cause for serious concern.  For the past few days the Seventh Army commanding general, the staff, and I had all been recommending a  withdrawal from the increasingly untenable front lines.  I told Hindenburg that I had come to Avesenes with the concurrence of the Seventh Army commanding general to secure such an order.

Parties representing a broad range of different constituencies ran candidates and voting was with proportional representation, so inevitably governments were formed by coalitions of parties: this time [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], Democrats, and Centrists. [[Friedrich Ebert|Ebert]] was elected as provisional chancellor; then the elected representatives assembled in Weimar to write a [[Weimar Constitution|constitution]]. It was based on the [[Constitution of the German Empire]] written in 1871, with many of the kaiser's powers now given to a president elected for a term of seven years. The president selected the chancellor and the members of the cabinet, but with the crucial stipulation that his nominees had to be ratified by the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], which because of proportional representation required support from several parties. The constitution was adopted on 11 August 1919. Ebert was elected as provisional president.\n\nThe terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] were written in secret. It was unveiled on 7 May 1919 and was followed by an ultimatum: either ratify the treaty, or the Allies would take whatever measures they deemed necessary to enforce its terms. While Germans of all political shades cursed the treaty as an insult to the nation's honor, President Ebert was sober enough to consider the possibility that Germany would not be in a position to turn it down. To save face, he asked Hindenburg whether the army was prepared to defend against an Allied invasion from the west, which Ebert believed would be all but certain if the treaty were voted down. If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out, he promised to urge rejection of the treaty. Under some prodding from his chief of staff, Groener, Hindenburg concluded the army could not resume the war under any circumstances. Rather than tell Ebert himself, he directed Groener to deliver the army's recommendation to the president.<ref name=\"RiseFall\">William Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' (Touchstone Edition) (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1990)</ref>  With just 19 minutes to spare, Ebert informed French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] that Germany would ratify the Treaty, which was signed on 28 June 1919.\n\n===Second retirement===\nBack in Hanover, as a field marshal he was provided with a staff who helped with his still extensive correspondence. He made few formal public appearances, but the streets around his house often were crowded with admirers when he took his afternoon walk. During the war he had left the newspaper reporters to Ludendorff, now he was available. He hunted locally and elsewhere, including an annual chamois hunt in Bavaria. The yearly Tannenberg memorial celebration kept him in the public eye.\n\nA Berlin publisher urged him to produce his memoirs which could educate and inspire by emphasizing his ethical and spiritual values; his story and ideas could be put on paper by a team of anonymous collaborators and the book would be translated immediately for the worldwide market.<ref>Dorpalen, Andreas ''Hindenburg and the Weimar Republic'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1964 pp.  44\u201345.</ref> ''Mein Leben'' (My Life) was a huge bestseller, presenting to the world his carefully crafted image as a staunch, steadfast, uncomplicated soldier. Major themes were the need for Germany to maintain a strong military as the school teaching young German men moral values and the need to restore the monarchy, because only under the leadership of the House of Hohenzollern could Germany become great again, with \"The conviction that the subordination of the individual to the good of the community was not only a necessity, but a positive blessing ...\".<ref>Hindenburg, '''1''', 1920, p. 89.</ref> Throughout the kaiser is treated with great respect.

Therefore, in March 1919 The ''Reichswehr'' was organized. The 430,000 armed men in Germany competed for the limited places.<ref>Mulligan, 2005, p. 96.</ref> Both Major Oskar Hindenburg and his army officer brother-in-law were selected. The chief of staff was Seeckt, camouflaged as Chief of the Troop Office. He favored staff officers above line officers and the proportion of nobles was the same as prewar.\n\nIn 1919, Hindenburg was subpoenaed to appear before the parliamentary commission investigating the responsibility for the outbreak of war in 1914 and for the defeat in 1918.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964, pp. 48\u201353.</ref> He was wary, as he had written: \"The only existing idol of the nation, undeservedly my humble self, runs the risk of being torn from its pedestal once it becomes the target of criticism.\".<ref>Pyta, Wolfram \"Hindenburg and the German Right\" pp. 25\u201347 from ''The German Right in the Weimar Republic: Studies in the History of German Conservatism, Nationalism, and Antisemitism'' edited by Larry Eugene Jones, Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2014 p. 32.</ref> Ludendorff was summoned also. They had been strangers since Ludendorff's dismissal, but they prepared and arrived together on 18 November 1919. Hindenburg refused to take the oath until Ludendorff was permitted to read a statement that they were under no obligation to testify since their answers might expose them to criminal prosecution, but they were waiving their right of refusal. On the stand Hindenburg read through a prepared statement, ignoring the chairman's repeated demands that he answer questions. He testified that the German Army had been on the verge of winning the war in the autumn of 1918 and that the defeat had been precipitated by a ''[[Dolchsto\u00df]]'' (\"stab in the back\") by disloyal elements on the home front and unpatriotic politicians, quoting an unnamed British general: \"The German Army was stabbed in the back.\" When his reading was finished Hindenburg walked out of the hearings, despite being threatened with contempt, sure that they would not dare charge a war hero. His testimony introduced the ''[[Dolchsto\u00dflegende]]'', which was adopted by nationalist and conservative politicians who sought to blame the socialist founders of the Weimar Republic for losing the war. Reviews in the German press that grossly misrepresented General [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Frederick Barton Maurice's]] book about the last months of the war firmed-up this myth.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maurice|first1=Major-General Sir F.|title=The last four months : the end of the war in the west|url=https://archive.org/details/lastfourmonthsen00mauruoft|date=1919|publisher=Cassell and Co|location=London}}</ref> Ludendorff had used these reviews to convince Hindenburg.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shirer|first1=William L.|title=The rise and fall of the Third Reich|url=https://archive.org/details/risefallthirdreich00shir|url-access=registration|date=1960|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/risefallthirdreich00shir/page/n46 31]}}</ref>  A 1929 film glorifying his life as a dedicated patriot solidified his image.<ref>Anna Menge,  \"The Iron Hindenburg: a popular icon of Weimar Germany.\" ''German History'' 26.3 (2008): 357\u201382.</ref>\n\n[[File:H & wife.jpg|thumb|Paul and Gertrud von Hindenburg|upright=1.0|left]]\n\nThe first presidential election was scheduled for 6 June 1920. Hindenburg wrote to Wilhelm II, in exile in the Netherlands, for permission to run.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Wilhelm approved, so on 8 March Hindenburg announced his intention to seek the presidency. Five days later Berlin was seized by regular and ''Freicorp'' troops led by General L\u00fcttwitz, the commander of the Berlin garrison, who proclaimed a prominent civil servant, [[Wolfgang Kapp]], president in a new government. Ludendorff and Colonel Bauer stood by Kapp's side. As the Reichswehr leadership refused to fight the coup, the legal government fled to Stuttgart. However the coup collapsed after six days as the civil service refused to cooperate and workers went on a general strike. The strike led to a Bolshevik uprising that was put down forcefully. Kapp died in prison while awaiting trial, Ludendorff fled to Bavaria where he was shielded by his fame, Bauer went into exile. The Reichstag postponed the presidential election and extended Ebert's term of office. Hindenburg cut back on public appearances.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. p. 55.</ref>\n\nHis serenity was shattered by the illness of his wife [[Gertrud von Hindenburg|Gertrud]], who died of cancer on 14 May 1921. He kept close to his three children, their spouses and his nine grandchildren. His son Oskar was at his side as the field marshal's liaison officer. Hindenburg was financially sustained by a fund set up by a group of admiring industrialists.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. p. 62.</ref>\n\nOn 8 November 1923 Hitler, with Ludendorff at his side, launched the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in Munich, which was suppressed by the Bavarian police. Hindenburg was not involved but inevitably was prominent in newspaper reports. He issued a statement urging national unity.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964, p. 63.</ref> On 16 November the [[Reichsbank]] introduced the [[German Rentenmark|Rentenmark]], which was indexed to gold bonds. Twelve zeros were cut from prices, which stabilized. The political divisions in the nation began to ease. The foreign minister was [[Gustav Stresemann]], the leader of the [[German People's Party]]. In 1924 the economy was shored up by the reduction in reparation payments in the [[Dawes Plan]] with loans from American banks. At Tannenberg in August before a crowd of 50,000 Hindenburg laid the headstone for an imposing memorial.\n\n==1925 election==\n''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' Ebert died on 28 February 1925 following an appendectomy. A new election had to be held within a month. None of the candidates attained the required majority; Ludendorff was last with a paltry 280,000 votes. By law there had to be another election. The Social Democrats, the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre]] and other democratic parties united to support the Centre's [[Wilhelm Marx]], who had twice served as chancellor and was now Minister President of Prussia. The [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] insisted on running their own candidate. The parties on the right established a committee to select their strongest candidate. After a week's indecision they decided on Hindenburg, despite his advanced age and fear, notably by Foreign Minister Stresemann, of unfavorable reactions by their former enemies. A delegation came to his home on 1 April. He stated his reservations but concluded \"If you feel that my election is necessary for the sake of the Fatherland, I'll run in God's name.\"<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. p. 71.</ref> However, some parties on the right still opposed him. Not willing to be humiliated like Ludendorff he drafted a telegram declining the nomination, but before it was sent, Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] and a young leader of the agrarian nobility of eastern Germany arrived in Hanover to persuade him to wait until the strength of his support was clearer. His conservative opponents gave way so he consented on 9 April. Again he obtained Wilhelm II's approval. His campaign stressed his devotion to \"social justice, religious equality, genuine peace at home and abroad.\"<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. p. 76.</ref> \"No war, no internal uprising, can emancipate our chained nation, which is, unfortunately, split by dissension.\" He addressed only one public meeting, held in Hanover, and gave one radio address on 11 April calling for a ''Volksgemeinschaft'' (national community) under his leadership.<ref>Pyta, 2014, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> The [[1925 German presidential election|second election]], held on 26 April 1925, required only a plurality, which he obtained thanks to the support of the [[Bavarian People's Party]] (BVP), which had switched from Marx, and by the refusal of the Communists to withdraw their candidate [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Richard J. |title=The coming of the Third Reich |date=2003 |publisher=[[Allen Lane]] |location=London |page=82}}</ref> In Britain and France the victory of the aged field marshal was accepted with equanimity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hindenburg |website=Sunday Times Digital Archive |page=14 |date=3 May 1925 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Herriot |first1=Edouard |title=Hindenburg's election |website=Sunday Times Digital Archive |location=London |page=14 |date=10 May 1925}}</ref>\n\n==Parliamentary governments==\n[[File:Reichspr\u00e4sidentenpalais, Berlin.jpg|thumb|The presidential palace|upright=1.5]]\n\nHindenburg took office on 12 May 1925, \"... offering my hand in this hour to every German\".<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. p. 88.</ref> He moved into the elegant Presidential Palace on the Wilhelmstrasse, accompanied by Oskar (his military liaison officer) and Oskar's wife and three children. The new president, always a stickler about uniforms, soon had the servants wear new regalia with the shoe buckles appropriate for a court.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ludwig |first1=Emil |title=Hindenburg and the saga of the German revolution |date=1935 |publisher=William Heinemann |location=London |page=265}}</ref> Nearby was the chancellery, which during Hindenburg's tenure would have seven residents. The president also enjoyed a shooting preserve. He notified Chancellor [[Hans Luther]] that he would replace the head of Ebert's presidential staff, Dr [[Otto Meissner]], with his own man, because the cabinet would have to consent. Meissner was kept on temporarily. He proved invaluable and was Hindenburg's right hand throughout his presidency.\n\nForeign Minister Stresemann had vacationed during the campaign so as not to tarnish his reputation with the victors by supporting the field marshal. The far right detested Stresemann for promoting friendly relations with the victors. At their first meeting Hindenburg listened attentively and was persuaded that Stresemann's strategy was correct.<ref>Berman, 1987, p. 88.</ref> He was cooler at their next, reacting to rightist backlash.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. p. 94.</ref> Nonetheless he supported the government's policy, so on 1 December 1925 the [[Locarno Treaties]] were signed, a significant step in restoring Germany's position in Europe. The right was infuriated because the Treaty accepted the loss of Alsace and Lorraine, though it mandated the withdrawal of the Allied troops occupying the Rhineland. The president always was lobbied intensely by visitors and letter writers. Hindenburg countered demands to restore the monarchy by arguing that restoring a Hohenzollern would block progress in revising Versailles.<ref>Pyta, 2014, pp. 25\u201347.</ref> He accepted the republic as the mechanism for restoring Germany's position in Europe, though Hindenburg was no ''Vernunftrepublikaner'' (republican by reason) because democracy was incompatible with the militaristic ''volksgemeinschaft'' (national community) that would unite the people into one for future conflicts.<ref>Pyta, 2014, p. 36.</ref>\n\nThe Treaty ended Luther's government, so Hindenburg had to assemble its replacement. The president could not command, but had to practice politics in the raw: painstakingly listening to and negotiating with party leaders to put together a bloc with a majority. Occasionally he was able to seal a deal as the revered, old field marshal by appealing to patriotism. After weeks of negotiations, Luther formed a new government with a cabinet drawn from the middle-of-the road parties, retaining Stresemann, which the Reichstag approved when threatened that otherwise the president would call new elections. That government was toppled by dispute over flying the old imperial flag alongside of the Weimar colors, which symbolically downgraded the republic. Marx was recalled as chancellor in a government that continued the dual flag policy. The next major issue was the properties of the former kings now held by the states: the question was whether former rulers should receive some compensation or none. More than 12 million voters petitioned for a referendum on this issue, meanwhile the Reichstag was debating an expropriation bill. Hindenburg's impulse was to resign so that he might express his opposition, but instead Meissner persuaded him to write a personal letter, which appeared in the newspapers, opposing expropriation. The referendum on 20 June 1926 rejected expropriation. Hindenburg urged the states to reach fair settlements promptly, otherwise he would resign. Stresemann's position in successive governments was solidified when he shared the Nobel Peace Prize for 1926.\n\n[[File:DR 1927 405 Paul von Hindenburg Nothilfe.jpg|thumb|180px| A Hindenburg stamp released in 1927 on the occasion of his 80th birthday]]\nThe next crisis came in the autumn of 1926 when ''Reichswehr'' commander Seeckt, without consulting the ''Reichswehr'' minister, invited the eldest son of the ex-crown prince to attend maneuvers. To keep the government in office, Hindenburg pressured Seeckt to resign. His successor was Wilhelm Heye. The Social Democrats shifted their stance and were willing to join a centrist government, which would strengthen it. Hindenburg was agreeable. But then the socialists demanded a completely new cabinet, which the government rejected, consequently the ''Reichstag'' voted no confidence after oratory that made much of the secret collaboration between the ''Reichswehr'' and the Red Army, which had been revealed in British newspapers. To counter these attacks the ''Reichswehr'' relied on Colonel [[Kurt von Schleicher]], who had served with Oskar in the Third Guards and was often a guest at the Palace. He assiduously strove to improve relations with the Republic. Again Hindenburg was saddled with finding a new government. He asked Marx to bring in more parties. The German Nationals agreed to join, and a new government was in place on 31 January 1927. It legislated the eight hour day and unemployment insurance.\n\nOn 18 September 1927 Hindenburg spoke at the dedication of the massive memorial at Tannenberg, outraging international opinion by denying Germany's responsibility for initiating World War I, thereby repudiating Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles. He declared that Germany entered the war as \"the means of self-assertion against a world full of enemies. Pure in heart we set off to the defence of the fatherland and with clean hands the German army carried the sword.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Great War and Medieval Memory: War, Remembrance and Medievalism in Britain and Germany, 1914\u20131940 |series=Studies in the Social and Cultural History of Modern Warfare |first=Stefan |last=Goebel |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=139 |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-85415-3}}</ref> His words were much stronger than in the draft approved by Stresemann. The Allied governments retaliated by not congratulating him on his eightieth birthday. (He was more upset by Ludendorff's refusal to have any contact at the ceremony.) Most Germans did celebrate his birthday: his present was Neudeck, the ancestral East Prussian estate of the Hindenburgs, purchased with funds from a public subscription. Later it became known that the title was in Oskar's name, to avoid potential inheritance tax.\n\nA financial scandal in the navy led to the resignation of the defense minister. As his replacement, Schleicher wanted Groener, whose chief-of-staff he had been late in the war. The right strongly opposed him, but the Reichstag approved. Groener in turn enhanced Schleicher's role in the army. The Reichstag's four-year term was coming to an end, so Hindenburg pressed it to promptly pass required legislation and then dissolved it on 31 March 1928. His leadership was widely applauded.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964. p. 139.</ref> The election on 20 May 1928 produced a shift to the left, although a handful of Nazis were elected. However, it was difficult to assemble a new government because several parties were reluctant to participate. Finally, sufficient support was found for the Social Democrat [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]] whom Hindenburg found clever and agreeable, later telling Groener that M\u00fcller was his best chancellor.<ref>Berman, 1987, p. 143.</ref>\n\n==Presidential governments==\nThe next crisis followed Stresemann's negotiation of the [[Young Plan]], which rescheduled reparations payments and opened the way for needed American loans. In addition, the French promised to leave the Rhineland in 1930, five years before schedule. The right formed a committee to block adoption, they started by intensively lobbying Hindenburg, using such powerful voices as Tirpitz. Hindenburg did not budge. For the first time the committee brought conservatives, like the powerful newspaper owner [[Alfred Hugenberg]], into alliance with the Nazis. They submitted the issues to a national plebiscite, in which they obtained only one-fifth of the vote. In his open letter when he promulgated the required legislation, Hindenburg pointed out that their major problem was the economic turmoil and growing unemployment stemming from the worldwide depression.\n\n[[File:Unemployment weimar.jpg|thumb|Percentage of German workers unemployed, 1920-1935|upright=1.5|right]]\n\nHis close advisers were Oskar, Groener, Meissner, and Schleicher, known as the ''[[Camarilla|Kamarilla]]''. The younger Hindenburg, \"the constitutionally unforeseen son of the President\", controlled access to the President.<ref>Turner, Henry Ashby ''Hitler's Thirty Days to Power'', Reading: Addison-Wesley, 1996 p. 113.</ref> Hindenburg tried to assemble the next government by obtaining enough support from political parties while retaining essential ministers such as Groener and Stresemann, but was unable to form a working combination, the parties were too diverse and divided. A new election would only reinforce these bitter divisions. Schleicher proposed a solution: a government in which the chancellor would be responsible to the president rather than the Reichstag, based on the so-called \"25/48/53 formula\",<ref name=\"J\u00e4ckel, Eberhard page 3\">J\u00e4ckel, Eberhard ''Hitler in History'' Hanover NH: Brandeis University Press, 1984 pp. 3\u20135.</ref> named for the three articles of the Constitution that could make such a \"Presidential government\" possible:\n* Article 25 allowed the President to dissolve the Reichstag.\n* [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] allowed the president to sign emergency bills into law without the consent of the Reichstag. However, the Reichstag could cancel any law passed by Article 48 by a simple majority vote within sixty days of its passage.\n* Article 53 allowed the president to appoint the chancellor.\n\nSchleicher suggested that in such a presidential government the trained economist and leader of the [[Catholic Center Party]] (''Zentrum'') [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] would make an excellent chancellor. Hindenburg first talked with Br\u00fcning in February 1930. He was impressed by his probity and by his outstanding combat record as a machine gun officer; and was reconciled to his being a Catholic. In January 1930, Meissner told Kuno von Westarp that soon Muller's \"Grand Coalition\" would replaced by a \"presidential government\" that would exclude the Social Democrats, adding that the coming \"Hindenburg government\" would be \"anti-Marxist\" and \"anti-parliamentarian\", serving as a transition to a dictatorship.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kolb |first1=Eberhard |title=The Weimar Republic |date=2005 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |page=118}}</ref> Schleicher maneuvered to exacerbate a bitter dispute within M\u00fcller's coalition, which was divided over whether the unemployment insurance rate should be raised by a half percentage point or a full percentage point.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nicolls |first1=Anthony |title=Weimar and the rise of Hitler |date=2000 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |location=London |page=139}}</ref> With the Grand Coalition government lacking support in the Reichstag, M\u00fcller asked Hindenburg to have his budget approved under Article 48, but Schleicher persuaded Hindenburg to refuse.<ref>Dorpalen, 1964, pp. 174\u201375.</ref> M\u00fcller's government fell on 27 March 1930 and Br\u00fcning became chancellor.

Faced with declining tax revenues and mounting costs for unemployment insurance, Br\u00fcning introduced an austerity budget with steep spending cuts and steep tax increases.<ref>J\u00e4ckel 1984, p. 5.</ref> The Young Plan required such a balanced budget. Nonetheless, his budget was defeated in the Reichstag in July 1930, so Hindenburg signed it into law by invoking Article 48. The Reichstag voted to repeal the budget, so Hindenburg dissolved it just two years into its mandate, and re-approved the budget with Article 48. Unemployment was still soaring. Hindenburg took no part in the campaign, in the September 1930 elections the Nazis achieved an electoral breakthrough, gaining 17 percent of the vote to become the second-strongest party in the Reichstag. The Communists also made striking gains, albeit not so great.\n\nAfter the elections, Br\u00fcning continued to govern largely through Article 48; his government was kept afloat by the Social Democrats who voted against canceling his Article 48 bills in order to avoid another election that could only benefit the Nazis and the Communists. The German historian [[Eberhard J\u00e4ckel]] concluded that presidential government was within the letter of the constitution, but violated its spirit as Article 54 stated the Chancellor and his cabinet were responsible to the Reichstag, and thus presidential government was an end-run around the constitution.<ref>J\u00e4ckel, 1984, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> Hindenburg for his part grew increasingly annoyed with Br\u00fcning, complaining that he was growing tired of using Article 48 all the time to pass bills. Hindenburg found the detailed notes that Br\u00fcning submitted explaining the economic necessity of each of his bills to be incomprehensible. Br\u00fcning continued with austerity, A decree in December 1930 once again cut the wages of public employees and the budget. Modest, withdrawn Br\u00fcning was completely unable to explain his measures to the voters, or even to the president, who relied on explanations from the ''Kamarilla''. The Nazis and German Nationals marched out of the Reichstag in opposition to a procedural rule. The 1931 budget was then passed easily, and the Reichstag adjourned until October after only increasing the military budget and the subsidies for Junkers in the so-called ''[[Osthilfe]]'' (Eastern Aid) program. In June 1931 there was a [[Great Depression|banking crisis]] in which the funds on deposit plummeted. Complete disaster was averted by United States President [[Herbert Hoover]] obtaining a temporary moratorium on reparation payments.\n\nIn the summer of 1931, Hindenburg complained in a letter to his daughter: \"What pains and angers me the most is being misunderstood by part of the political right\".<ref name=\"auto\">Pyta, 2014, p. 42.</ref> He met [[Adolf Hitler]] for the first time in October 1931, at a high-level conference in Berlin. Everyone present saw that they took an immediate dislike to each other. Afterwards Hindenburg in private often disparagingly referred to Hitler as \"that Austrian corporal\", \"that Bohemian corporal\" or sometimes simply as \"the corporal\" and also derided Hitler's Austrian dialect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Astore |first1=William |last2=Showalter |first2=Denis |title=Hindenburg: Icon of German Militarism |date=2005 |publisher=Potomac Books |location=Washington, DC |page=106}}</ref> For his part, Hitler often labeled Hindenburg as \"that old fool\" or \"that old reactionary\". On 26 January 1933, Hindenburg privately told a group of his friends: \"Gentlemen, I hope you will not hold me capable of appointing this Austrian corporal to be Reich Chancellor\".<ref>J\u00e4ckel, 1984, p. 8.</ref> Hindenburg made it clear that he saw himself as the leader of the \"national\" forces and expected Hitler to follow his lead.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn foreign affairs he spoke with hostility towards Poland, often expressing a hope that the Polish state would disappear from the map of Europe \"at an appropriate moment\"<ref>''A ridiculous hundred million Slavs: concerning Adolf Hitler's world-view'', Tadeusz Manteuffel, Institute of History, Polish Academy of Sciences, Jerzy Wojciech Borejsza, p. 55, Warsaw 2017</ref>\n\n==Second presidency==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99203, Berlin, Wahlplakat f\u00fcr Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|Election poster for Hindenburg in 1932 (translation: \"With him\")|upright=0.7]]\n\nBy January 1932, at the age of 84, Hindenburg was vacillating about running for a second term.

Hitler was to be one of his opponents in the election. Hindenburg left most campaigning to others, in his single radio address he stressed the need for unity, \"I recall the spirit of 1914, and the mood at the front, which asked about the man, and not about his class or party\".<ref>Pyta, 2014, p. 43.</ref> Hitler campaigned vigorously throughout Germany.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13227, Paul von Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|Hindenburg, aged 84, at a radio microphone in 1932 during the election campaign in which he defeated Hitler|left|upright=1.0]]\n\nIn the first round of voting in March 1932, Hindenburg was front-runner, but failed to gain the required majority.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nicolls |first1=Anothony |title=Weimar and the rise of Hitler |date=2000 |place=New York |publisher=Macmillan |page=159}}</ref> In the runoff the following month Hindenburg won with 53 percent of the vote. However, he was disappointed because he lost voters from the right, only winning by the support of those who had strongly opposed him seven years before. He wrote \"Despite all the blows in the neck I have taken, I will not abandon my efforts for a healthy move to the Right\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> He called in the party leaders for advice, during the meetings Meissner led the discussions while Hindenburg would only speak briefly on crucial points. Schleicher took the lead in choosing the cabinet, in which he was ''Reichswehr'' Minister. Groener was now even more unpopular to the right because he had banned wearing party uniforms in public. On 13 May 1932 Schleicher told Groener that he had \"lost the confidence of the Army\" and must resign at once.<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, 1967, p. 243.</ref> Once Groener was gone, the ban was lifted and the Nazi brownshirts were back battling on the streets.\n\nTo cope with mounting unemployment, Br\u00fcning desperately wanted an emergency decree to launch a program in which bankrupt estates would be carved up into small farms and turned over to unemployed settlers. When they met, Hindenburg read a statement that there would be no further decrees and insisted that the cabinet resign, there must be a turn to the right. Br\u00fcning resigned on 1 June 1932. He was succeeded by Papen from the Centre Party, who was Schleicher's choice, Hindenburg did not even ask the party leaders for advice. He was delighted with Papen, a rich, smooth aristocrat who had been a famous equestrian and a general staff officer; he soon became a Hindenburg family friend (Schleicher was no longer welcomed because he had quarreled with Oskar). The president was delighted to find that eight members of the new cabinet had served as officers during the war.\n\nThanks to the previous government, reparations were phased out at the [[Lausanne Conference of 1932|Lausanne Conference]], but without progress on other issues, so it was attacked by the German right. The Social Democratic government of the State of Prussia was a caretaker, because it had lost its mandate in the preceding election. Papen accused it of failing to maintain public order, and removed it on 20 July. The national elections came eleven days later. Eight parties received substantial numbers of votes, but those supporting the government lost strength, while opponents on the right and left gained. The Nazis polled almost the same 37 percent they had in the presidential election, making them the largest party in the Reichstag. Schleicher negotiated with them, proposing that Hitler become vice-chancellor. Hitler demanded the chancellorship along with five cabinet positions and important posts in the state governments; additionally the Reichstag would have to pass an [[Enabling act]] giving a new government all needed powers, otherwise it would be dissolved. Around the country Nazi stormtroopers were running riot, attacking their political opponents. Hindenburg refused to make Hitler chancellor, so he met with Hitler to explain that he was unwilling to bring a single party to power, concluding with \"I want to extend my hand to you as a fellow soldier.\"<ref>Dorpalen, 1964, p. 355.</ref> The following morning he left for Neudeck; most of the newspapers praised his defense of the constitution. The constitution mandated a new election within sixty days, but owing to the crisis Hindenburg postponed it. Papen published an economic recovery plan that almost all of the parties and the labor unions lambasted. His scant support crumbled further.\n\nTo add enough votes to gain a parliamentary mandate, Schleicher tried to persuade some of the Nazi leaders, like the war hero [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], to defect and to take a position in his government. None of them would, so he became another presidential chancellor, still courting prominent Nazis\u2014otherwise his days as chancellor were numbered. Papen continued to negotiate with Hitler, who moderated his conditions: he would settle for the chancellorship, the Reich Commissioner of Prussia and two cabinet positions: interior and a new slot for aviation. He also promised that he would respect the rights of the president, the Reichstag and the press, and Papen would be vice-chancellor. On these terms, Hindenburg allowed Oskar and Meissner to meet secretly with Hitler, culminating in an hour's ''t\u00eate-\u00e1-t\u011bte'' between Hitler and Oskar. Schleicher learned of the secret meeting and the following morning met with the president to demand emergency powers and the dissolution of the Reichstag. Hindenburg refused the powers but agreed to the election. Before a new government could be formed Hindenburg called General [[Werner von Blomberg]], an opponent of Schleicher, back from a disarmament conference and appointed him ''Reichswehr'' minister, perhaps unaware that he was a Nazi sympathizer.\n\n==Hitler becomes chancellor==\nTo break the stalemate, Hindenburg proposed Hitler as chancellor, Papen as vice-chancellor and Reich commissioner of Prussia, and G\u00f6ring as Prussian interior minister (who controlled the police). Two other cabinet ministers would be Nazis, the remaining eight would be from other parties. When Hindenburg met with Hitler, Papen would always be present. The new cabinet included only three Nazis: Hitler, G\u00f6ring and [[Wilhelm Frick]]. Besides Hitler, Frick was the only Nazi with a portfolio; he held the nearly powerless Interior Ministry (unlike the rest of Europe, at the time the Interior Ministry had no power over the police, which was the responsibility of the ''L\u00e4nder''). G\u00f6ring did not receive a portfolio, but critically was made Prussian interior minister, controlling the largest police force in which he promoted Nazis as commanders. Blomberg was Reichswehr minister, Hugenberg was both economics and agriculture minister, and Seldte (the leader of the right wing [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm party]]) was labor minister. The other ministers were holdovers from the Papen and Schleicher cabinets.\n\nHitler's first act as chancellor was to ask Hindenburg to dissolve the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], so that the Nazis and [[Deutschnationale Volkspartei]] (\"German Nationalists\" or DNVP) could win an outright majority to pass the [[Enabling Act]] that would give the new government power to rule by decree, supposedly for the next four years. Unlike laws passed by Article 48, which could be cancelled by a majority in the ''Reichstag'', under the Enabling Act the Chancellor could pass laws by decree that could not be cancelled by a vote in the ''Reichstag''.  Hindenburg agreed to this request. In early February 1933, Papen asked for and received an Article 48 bill signed into law that sharply limited [[freedom of the press]]. After the [[Reichstag fire]] on 27 February, Hindenburg, at Hitler's urging, signed into law the ''[[Reichstag Fire Decree]]'' via Article 48, which effectively suspended all civil liberties in Germany. G\u00f6ring as Prussian Interior Minister had enlisted thousands of [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) men as auxiliary policemen, who attacked political opponents of the Nazis, with [[Communist]]s and [[Social Democrat]]s being singled out for particular abuse. [[Fritz Sch\u00e4ffer]], a conservative Catholic and a leading politician of the [[Bavarian People's Party]] met Hindenburg on 17 February 1933 to complain about the ongoing campaign of terror against the SPD.<ref>{{cite book |first=Wolfram |last=Pyta |chapter=Hindenburg and the German Right |title=The German Right in the Weimar Republic: Studies in the History of German Conservatism, Nationalism, and Antisemitism |editor-first=Larry Eugene |editor-last=Jones |publisher=Berghahn Books |date=2014 |isbn=978-1785332012 |page=41}}</ref> Sch\u00e4ffer told Hindenburg: {{quote|We reject the notion that millions of Germans are not to be designated as national.

Therefore, the Nazis had his full support in their campaign against the Social Democrats.<ref name=\"Pyta pages 25\"/>\n\nHindenburg disliked Hitler, but he approved of his efforts to create the ''[[volksgemeinschaft]]''.<ref name=\"Pyta pages 25\"/> For Hindenburg, the \"Government of National Concentration\" headed by Hitler was the fulfillment of what he had been seeking since 1914, the creation of the ''volksgemeinschaft''.<ref name=\"Pyta pages 25\"/> Despite the ensuing anti-red hysteria, the Nazis received only 44% of the vote, though with the support of the DNVP they had a majority in the Reichstag.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S38324, Tag von Potsdam, Adolf Hitler, Paul v. Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|Hitler and Hindenburg at the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Garrison Church]] in [[Potsdam]]|left|upright=1.0]]\n\nHitler soon obtained Hindenburg's confidence, promising that after Germany regained full sovereignty, the monarchy would be restored; after a few weeks Hindenburg no longer asked Papen to join their meetings. The opening of the new Reichstag was celebrated with a Nazi extravaganza: Hindenburg descended into the crypt of the old garrison church in Potsdam to commune with the spirit of [[Frederick the Great]] at his grave, attended by Hitler who saluted the president as \"the custodian of the new rise of our people.\"<ref>Dorpalen, 1964, p. 466.</ref> An [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] was prepared that transferred law-making from the Reichstag to the government, even if the new laws violated the constitution. With the Communist deputies and many Social Democrats kept out of the chamber (in violation of Articles 36 and 37 of the constitution), the Reichstag passed the Act with well more than the needed two-thirds majority, effectively ending the Republic. As it turned out, that meeting took place in such an intimidating atmosphere that the Enabling Act would have garnered the required supermajority even with all deputies present and voting.\n\nDuring 1933 and 1934, Hitler was very aware of the fact that Hindenburg's power to sack him was the only means by which he could be legally removed from office. With the passage of the Enabling Act and the banning of all parties other than the Nazis, Hindenburg was the only check on Hitler's power. Given that Hindenburg was still a popular war hero and a revered figure in the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', there was little doubt that the ''Reichswehr'' would side with Hindenburg if he ever decided to sack Hitler. Thus, as long as Hindenburg was alive, Hitler was always very careful to avoid offending him or the Army.  Although Hindenburg was in increasingly bad health, the Nazis made sure that whenever Hindenburg did appear in public it was in Hitler's company. During these appearances, Hitler always made a point of showing him the utmost respect and deference. However, in private, Hitler detested Hindenburg, and expressed his hope that \"the old reactionary\" would hurry up and die as soon as possible.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-2006-0429-502,_Tannenberg-Denkmal,_Beisetzung_Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|The [[Tannenberg Memorial]] where Hindenburg and his wife were buried|upright=1.0]]\n\n[[Economy of Nazi Germany|Economic austerity]] was abandoned as Hitler poured money into new programs hiring the unemployed, buying [[Economy of Nazi Germany|armaments]], and building infrastructure\u2014especially roads and ''autobahns''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Overy|first1=R. J.|title=War and economy in the Third Reich|date=1994|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford, England|pages=37\u201389}}</ref> Within a year, unemployment fell by almost 40%. Hitler gained the support of the armed forces by promising to rebuild their strength. The German states were taken over by the national government, the labor unions were suppressed, political opponents were imprisoned, and Jews were ejected from the civil service which included the universities. Hindenburg only objected about the treatment of Jews; he wanted war veterans retained, to which Hitler acceded. When Hitler moved to eject Hugenberg from the cabinet and to suppress the political parties, a trusted colleague of Hugenberg's was sent to Neudeck to appeal for assistance but only met with Oskar. Hindenburg delayed the appointment of one Nazi ''Gauleiter'', but failed to obtain the installation of a Lutheran bishop he favored. The honor guard at Neudeck now were storm troopers. On 27 August at the stirring ceremonies at Tannenberg the president was presented with two large East Prussian properties near Neudeck. On the night before the plebiscite on Nazi rule scheduled for 11 November 1933, Hindenburg appealed to the voters to support their president and their chancellor, 95.1% of those voting did so. When a new commander of the army was to be appointed the president's choice won out over the chancellor's, but Hindenburg accepted a change in the military oath that eliminated obedience to the president and placed the swastika on military uniforms. By summer 1934, Hindenburg was dying of metastasized [[bladder cancer]] and his correspondence was dominated by complaints of Nazi stormtroopers running amok.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kershaw|first1=Ian|authorlink=Ian Kershaw|title=Hitler. 1889\u20131936: Hubris|date=1995|publisher=W.W.

With his support, Papen gave [[Marburg speech|a speech]] at the [[University of Marburg]] on 17 June calling for an end to state terror and the restoration of some freedoms.  When Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] got wind of it, he not only canceled a scheduled tape-delayed broadcast of the speech, but ordered the seizure of newspapers in which part of the text was printed.<ref name=\"RiseFall\"/>\n\nPapen was furious, telling Hitler that he was acting as a \"trustee\" of Hindenburg, and that a \"junior minister\" like Goebbels had no right to silence him. He resigned and immediately notified Hindenburg about what happened. Hindenburg was equally outraged, and told Blomberg to give Hitler an ultimatum\u2014unless Hitler took steps to end the growing tension in Germany and rein in the SA, Hindenburg would sack him, declare [[martial law]] and turn the government over to the army.

The day before Hitler received word that Hindenburg was on his deathbed.  He then had the cabinet pass the \"Law Concerning the Highest State Office of the Reich,\" which stipulated that upon Hindenburg's death, the offices of president and chancellor would be merged under the title of Leader and chancellor (''F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler'').<ref>{{cite book|title=The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia|last=Overy|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Overy|publisher=W.W.

He worked feverishly to get the armed forces\u2014the only group in Germany that would be nearly powerful enough to remove him with Hindenburg gone\u2014to support his bid to become head of state after Hindenburg's death.  In a meeting aboard the ''[[German cruiser Deutschland|Deutschland]]'' on April 11 with Blomberg, army commander [[Werner von Fritsch]] and naval commander [[Erich Raeder]], Hitler publicly proposed that he himself succeed Hindenburg. In return for the armed forces' support, he agreed to suppress the SA and promised that the armed forces would be the only bearers of arms in Germany under his watch. Raeder agreed right away, but Fritsch withheld his support until May 18, when the senior generals unanimously agreed to back Hitler as Hindenburg's successor.<ref name=\"RiseFall\"/>\n\nHitler had [[1934 German referendum|a plebiscite held on 19 August 1934]], in which the German people were asked if they approved of Hitler merging the two offices. The ''Ja'' (Yes) vote amounted to 90% of the vote.\n\nContrary to Hindenburg's will, he was interred with his wife in a magnificent ceremony at the [[Tannenberg Memorial]]. In 1944, as the Russians approached, ''Generalleutnant'' Oskar von Hindenburg moved his parents' remains to western Germany. After World War II the Poles razed the Tannenberg Memorial to the ground.\n\nThe remains of Hindenburg and his wife currently lie buried in [[St. Elizabeth's Church, Marburg]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Hindenburg Porzellan Medaille 1927.jpg|thumb|Porcelain medal in honour of Hindenburg's 80<sup>th</sup> birthday on Oct. 2, 1927, produced  by [[:en:Meissen porcelain|Staatliche Porzellan-Manufaktur Meissen]]]]\nAccording to historian Anna Menge:\n{{Quote|The intensity, longevity, striking political and social breadth, and political deployment of the adulation for Hindenburg\u2014in short, the power of the Hindenburg myth from 1914 until 1934 and beyond\u2014was a political phenomenon of the first order....The Hindenburg myth was one of the central narratives in German public discourse during the First World War, the Weimar Republic, and the early years of Nazi rule. The striking polyvalence of the narrative\u2014it extolled not only right-wing notions of authoritarian leadership but also more bi-partisan national values, such as salvaging something positive from war and defeat and self-affirmation in the face of crisis\u2014meant that Hindenburg\u2019s myth could be deployed by different groups, at different times, and for different purposes. Although promoted first and foremost by German nationalists, especially in Weimar\u2019s early years, some elements of the Hindenburg myth had considerable cross-party appeal. That his initiation as a mythical figure rested on national defence and a battle fought against the arch-enemy of German Social Democracy, Tsarist Russia, had endeared him to many on the moderate left from 1914 onwards.<ref>Anna Menge,  \"The Iron Hindenburg: a popular icon of Weimar Germany.\" German History 26.3 (2008): 357\u201382, quoting 358\u201359.</ref>}}\n\nThe famed [[zeppelin]] ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' that was [[Hindenburg disaster|destroyed by fire in 1937]] was named in his honor, as was the [[Hindenburgdamm]], a [[causeway]] joining the island of [[Sylt]] to mainland [[Schleswig-Holstein]] that was built during his time in office. The previously [[Province of Upper Silesia|Upper Silesian]] town of [[Zabrze]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Hindenburg O.S.}}) was also renamed after him in 1915, as well as the [[SMS Hindenburg|SMS ''Hindenburg'']], a [[battlecruiser]] commissioned in the Imperial German Navy in 1917 and the last capital ship to enter service in the Imperial Navy.  The [[Hindenburg Range]] in New Guinea, which includes perhaps one of the world's largest cliffs, the Hindenburg Wall, also bears his name.\n\nHistorian [[Christopher Clark]] has criticized Hindenburg in his role as head of state for:\n{{Quote|withdrawing his solemn constitutional oaths of 1925 and 1932 to make common cause with the sworn enemies of the Republic.  And then, having publicly declared that he would never consent to appoint Hitler to any post...levered the Nazi leader into the German Chancellery in January 1933.  The Field Marshal had a high opinion of himself, and he doubtless sincerely believed that he personified a Prussian \u2018tradition\" of selfless service.  But he was not, in truth, a man of tradition...As a military commander and later as Germany's head of state, Hindenburg broke virtually every bond he entered into.  He was not the man of dogged, faithful service, but the man of image, manipulation and betrayal.\u2033<ref>Christopher Clark, ''The Iron Kingdom, The Rise and Downfall of Prussia 1600\u20131947''  (2007) p. 654.</ref>}}\n\n==Decorations and awards==\n; National\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Paul von Hindenburg (Order of the Golden Fleece).svg|thumb|right|Coat of arms of Paul von Hindenburg as knight of the Spanish branch of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]]]]\n* {{flag|Kingdom of Prussia}}:\n** Knight of the [[Order of the Black Eagle]]\n** Grand Commander of the Royal [[House Order of Hohenzollern]] with Swords\n** [[Pour le M\u00e9rite]] (2 September 1914); Oak Leaves added on 23 February 1915\n** [[Iron Cross]], 1st and 2nd class\n** [[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]] (9 December 1916); Golden Star added on 25 March 1918 ([[Star of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]])\n* {{flag|Kingdom of Bavaria}}: Knight Grand Cross of the [[Military Order of Max Joseph]]\n* {{flag|Kingdom of Saxony}}: Knight Grand Cross of the [[Military Order of St. Henry]]\n* {{flag|Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg}}: Knight of the [[Order of Military Merit (W\u00fcrttemberg)|Order of Military Merit]]\n* {{Flag|Oldenburg}}: Knight Grand Cross with Crown, Swords and Laurel of the [[House and Merit Order of Peter Frederick Louis]]\n* {{flag|Mecklenburg-Schwerin}}: [[Military Merit Cross (Mecklenburg-Schwerin)|Military Merit Cross]], 1st class\n* {{flag|Anhalt}}: [[Friedrich Cross]], 1st class\n* Honorary Commander of the [[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)]]\n\n;Foreign\n* {{flag|Austrian Empire}}:\n** Grand Cross of the [[Military Order of Maria Theresa]]\n** [[Military Merit Cross (Austria-Hungary)|Cross of Military Merit]], 1st class with war decoration\n** Gold [[Military Merit Medal (Austria-Hungary)|Medal of Military Merit]] (\"Signum Laudis\")\n* {{flag|Restoration (Spain)}}: Knight of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (Spain)<ref>Awarded in 1931 as German head of state.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Military of Germany|World War I|Conservatism}}\n* [[1925 German presidential election]]\n* [[1932 German presidential election]]\n* [[German Reichsmark]], coin.\n* [[Hindenburg light]]\n* [[List of people on the cover of Time Magazine: 1920s]] \u2212 22 March 1926\n{{clear right}}\n\n==References==\n<!-- Dead note \"2\": J\u00e4ckel, Eberhard ''Hitler in History'' page 8. -->\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book |last=Asprey, Robert |title=The German High Command at War: Hindenburg and Ludendorff Conduct World War I |location=New York |publisher=[[William Morrow and Company|W.

It has a high mortality rate if untreated but is [[Vaccine-preventable diseases|vaccine-preventable]]. While best known as a cause of [[meningitis]], it can also result in [[sepsis]], which is an even more damaging and dangerous condition. Meningitis and meningococcemia are major causes of illness, death, and disability in both [[developed countries|developed]] and [[underdeveloped countries|under-developed countries]].\n\nThere are approximately 2,600 cases of bacterial meningitis per year in the United States, and on average 333,000 cases in developing countries.

[[Meningococcal vaccine]]s have sharply reduced the incidence of the disease in developed countries.\n\nThe disease's pathogenesis is not fully understood. ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'' colonises a substantial proportion of the general population harmlessly, but in a very small percentage of individuals it can invade the bloodstream, affecting the entire body, most notably limbs and brain, causing serious illness.

Meningitis is a disease caused by inflammation and irritation of the [[meninges]], the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. In meningococcal meningitis this is caused by the bacteria invading the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and circulating through the [[central nervous system]]. Sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, Western Europe, the UK, and Ireland still face many challenges combating this disease.<ref name=\"WHOpub\">{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/WHO_EMC_BAC_98_3_EN/en/|title=Control of epidemic meningococcal disease.

This is a multilobar, rapidly evolving pneumonia, sometimes associated with septic shock. With prompt treatment, the prognosis is excellent. Another alternative is dexamethasone with vancomycin and meropenem.<ref>Sanford Guide to antimicrobial therapy 2014 44th edition</ref> [[Pericarditis]] can appear, either as a septic pericarditis with grave prognosis or as a reactive pericarditis in the wake of meningitis or septicaemia.\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n===Meningitis===\nThe patient with meningococcal meningitis typically presents with high fever, [[nuchal rigidity]] (stiff neck), [[Kernig's sign]], severe headache, vomiting, [[purpura]], [[photophobia]], and sometimes chills, altered mental status, or seizures. Diarrhea or respiratory symptoms are less common. [[Petechiae]] are often also present, but do not always occur, so their absence should not be used against the diagnosis of meningococcal disease. Anyone with symptoms of meningococcal meningitis should receive intravenous antibiotics before the results of [[lumbar puncture]], as delay in treatment worsens the prognosis.\n\n===Meningococcemia===\nSymptoms of [[meningococcemia]] are, at least initially, similar to those of [[influenza]]. Typically, the first symptoms include fever, [[nausea]], myalgia, headache, [[arthralgia]], [[chills]], diarrhea, stiff neck, and malaise. Later symptoms include [[septic shock]], [[purpura]], hypotension, cyanosis, [[petechiae]], seizures, anxiety, and [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]]. [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome]] and altered mental status may also occur. The petechial rash appear with the 'star-like' shape. Meningococcal sepsis has a greater mortality rate than meningococcal meningitis, but the risk of neurologic sequelae is much lower.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n== Pathogenesis ==\nMeningococcal disease causes life-threatening meningitis and sepsis conditions. In the case of meningitis, bacteria attack the lining between the brain and skull called the [[meninges]]. Infected fluid from the meninges then passes into the [[spinal cord]], causing symptoms including stiff neck, [[fever]] and [[rash]]es. The meninges (and sometimes the brain itself) begin to swell, which affects the [[central nervous system]].\n\nEven with antibiotics, approximately 1 in 10 victims of meningococcal meningitis will die; however, about as many survivors of the disease lose a limb or [[deaf|their hearing]], or suffer permanent [[brain damage]].<ref name=\"Centersfor\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meningococcal disease among college students: ACIP modifies recommendations for meningitis vaccination. Press release. 1999 Oct 20</ref> The sepsis type of infection is much more deadly, and results in a severe [[blood poisoning]] called meningococcal sepsis that affects the entire body. In this case, bacterial toxins rupture blood vessels and can rapidly shut down vital organs. Within hours, patient's health can change from seemingly good to mortally ill.<ref name=\"Jeeri2012\">Jeeri R. Reddy and Thiombiano S. Rigobert.

Bull. 2007{{unreliable source?|date=July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe ''N. meningitidis'' bacterium is surrounded by a slimy outer coat that contains disease-causing [[Lipopolysaccharide|endotoxin]]. While many bacteria produce endotoxin, the levels produced by meningococcal bacteria are 100 to 1,000 times greater (and accordingly more lethal) than normal. As the bacteria multiply and move through the bloodstream, it sheds concentrated amounts of toxin. The endotoxin directly affects the heart, reducing its ability to circulate blood, and also causes pressure on blood vessels throughout the body. As some blood vessels start to [[hemorrhage]], major organs like the lungs and kidneys are damaged.\n\nPatients suffering from meningococcal disease are treated with a large dose of [[antibiotic]]. The systemic antibiotic flowing through the bloodstream rapidly kills the bacteria but, as the bacteria are killed, even more toxin is released. It takes up to several days for the toxin to be neutralized from the body by using continuous liquid treatment and antibiotic therapy.<ref name=\"Jeeri2012\" />\n\n== Prevention ==\nThe most important form of prevention is a vaccine against ''N. meningitidis''. Different countries have different strains of the bacteria and therefore use different vaccines. Twelve serogroups (strains) exist with six having the potential to cause a major epidemic - A, B, C, X, Y and W135 are responsible for virtually all cases of the disease in humans. Vaccines are currently available against all six strains, including the newest vaccine against serogroup B. The first vaccine to prevent meningococcal serogroup B (meningitis B) disease was approved by the [[European Commission]] on 22 January 2013. The vaccine is manufactured by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] and sold under the trade name Bexsero. Bexsero is for use in all age groups from two months of age and older.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novartis.com/newsroom/media-releases/en/2013/1672036.shtml|title=Novartis receives EU approval for Bexsero, first vaccine to prevent the leading cause of life-threatening meningitis across Europe|author=Press Release|publisher=Novartis|date=22 January 2013|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Menveo]] and [[Mencevax]] of [[GlaxoSmithKline]] Vaccines , [[Menactra]] and [[Menomune]] of [[Sanofi-Aventis]], and [[NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135]] (has not been licensed in the US) of [[JN-International Medical Corporation]], are the commonly used vaccines.

Close contacts are defined as those persons who could have had intimate contact with the patient's oral secretions such as through kissing or sharing of food or drink. The importance of the carrier state in meningococcal disease is well known. In developed countries the disease transmission usually occurs in day care, schools and large gatherings where usually disease transmission could occur. Because the meningococcal organism is transmitted by respiratory droplets and is susceptible to drying, it has been postulated that close contact is necessary for transmission. Therefore, the disease transmission to other susceptible person cannot be prevented. Meningitis occurs sporadically throughout the year, and since the organism has no known reservoir outside of man, asymptomatic carriers are usually the source of transmission.<ref>Control and Prevention of Meningococcal Disease: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP): VIRGINIA EPIDEMIOLOGY BULLETIN, July 1997, Volume 97, Number 7</ref>\n\nAdditionally, basic [[hygiene]] measures, such as handwashing and not sharing drinking cups, can reduce the incidence of infection by limiting exposure. When a case is confirmed, all close contacts with the infected person can be offered [[antibiotics]] to reduce the likelihood of the infection spreading to other people. However, rifampin-resistant strains have been reported and the indiscriminate use of antibiotics contributes to this problem.

During follow up no cases of meningococcal disease were reported and thus true antibiotic preventative measures could not be directly assessed. However, the data suggested that [[Rifampicin|rifampin]], [[ceftriaxone]], [[ciprofloxacin]] and penicillin were equally effective for the eradication of ''N. meningitidis'' in potential carriers, although rifampin was associated with resistance to the antibiotic following treatment. Eighteen studies provided data on side effects and reported they were minimal but included nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness and pain at injection site.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zalmanovici Trestioreanu|first=Anca|last2=Fraser|first2=Abigail|last3=Gafter-Gvili|first3=Anat|last4=Paul|first4=Mical|last5=Leibovici|first5=Leonard|date=2013-10-25|editor-last=Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group|title=Antibiotics for preventing meningococcal infections|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=10|pages=CD004785|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004785.pub5|pmid=24163051|pmc=6698485}}</ref>\n\n===Disease outbreak control===\nMeningitis A, C, Y and W-135 vaccines can be used for large-scale vaccination programs when an outbreak of meningococcal disease occurs in Africa and other regions of the world. Whenever sporadic or cluster cases or outbreaks of meningococcal disease occur in the US, [[chemoprophylaxis]] is the principal means of preventing secondary cases in household and other close contacts of individuals with invasive disease. Meningitis A, C, Y and W-135 vaccines rarely may be used as an adjunct to chemoprophylaxis,1 but only in situations where there is an ongoing risk of exposure (e.g., when cluster cases or outbreaks occur) and when a serogroup contained in the vaccine is involved.<ref name=ACIP05/>\n\nIt is important that clinicians promptly report all cases of suspected or confirmed meningococcal disease to local public health authorities and that the serogroup of the meningococcal strain involved be identified. The effectiveness of mass vaccination programs depends on early and accurate recognition of outbreaks. When a suspected outbreak of meningococcal disease occurs, public health authorities will then determine whether mass vaccinations (with or without mass chemoprophylaxis) is indicated and delineate the target population to be vaccinated based on risk assessment.<ref name=ACIP05/><ref name=Pediatrics05 />\n\n==Treatment ==\n[[File:Charlotte Cleverley-Bisman.jpg |thumb|[[Charlotte Cleverley-Bisman]], who had all four limbs partially amputated aged seven months due to meningococcal disease.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wane |first1=Joanna |title=The case for vaccination |url=http://www.biocsl.co.nz/docs/957/642/NorthSouth_case-for-accination.pdf |website=North & South |accessdate=July 3, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824083950/http://www.biocsl.co.nz/docs/957/642/NorthSouth_case-for-accination.pdf |archive-date=24 August 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>]]\nWhen meningococcal disease is suspected, treatment must be started ''immediately'' and should not be delayed while waiting for investigations. Treatment in primary care usually involves prompt intramuscular administration of [[benzylpenicillin]], and then an urgent transfer to hospital (hopefully, an academic level I medical center, or at least a hospital with round the clock neurological care, ideally with neurological intensive and critical care units) for further care. Once in the hospital, the antibiotics of choice are usually IV broad spectrum 3rd generation [[cephalosporins]], e.g., [[cefotaxime]] or [[ceftriaxone]]. Benzylpenicillin and [[chloramphenicol]] are also effective. Supportive measures include IV fluids, oxygen, inotropic support, e.g., dopamine or dobutamine and management of raised [[intracranial pressure]]. Steroid therapy may help in some adult patients, but is unlikely to affect long term outcomes.\n\nWhich antibiotic should be used immediately (before hospital admission) for suspected cases of meningococcal disease? A [[systematic review]] compared two antibiotics. There was one trial: an open label (not blinded) non-inferiority trial of 510 people comparing two different types of antibiotics; [[ceftriaxone]] (in which there were 14 deaths out of 247), and [[chloramphenicol]] (12 deaths out of 256). There were no reported side effects. Both antibiotics were considered equally effective.

Cases of meningococcemia leading to severe [[meningoencephalitis]] are common among young children and the elderly. Deaths occurring in less than 24 hours are more likely during the disease epidemic seasons in Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa is hit by meningitis disease outbreaks throughout the epidemic season. It may be that climate change<ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=77675 AFRICA: Climate change linked to spread of disease]</ref> contributes significantly the spread of the disease in [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cameroon]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Togo]]. This is an area of Africa where the disease is endemic: meningitis is \"silently\" present, and there are always a few cases. When the number of cases passes five per population of 100,000 in one week, teams are on alert. Epidemic levels are reached when there have been 100 cases per 100,000 populations over several weeks.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/ Meningococcal meningitis]</ref>\n\nFurther complicating efforts to halt the spread of meningitis in Africa is the fact that extremely dry, dusty weather conditions which characterize Niger and Burkina Faso from December to June favor the development of epidemics. Overcrowded villages are breeding grounds for bacterial transmission and lead to a high prevalence of respiratory tract infections, which leave the body more susceptible to infection, encouraging the spread of meningitis.

Meningitis is a disease caused by inflammation and irritation of the [[meninges]], the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. In meningococcal meningitis this is caused by the bacteria invading the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and circulating through the [[central nervous system]]. Sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, Western Europe, the UK, and Ireland still face many challenges combating this disease.<ref name=\"WHOpub\">{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/WHO_EMC_BAC_98_3_EN/en/|title=Control of epidemic meningococcal disease.

This is a multilobar, rapidly evolving pneumonia, sometimes associated with septic shock. With prompt treatment, the prognosis is excellent. Another alternative is dexamethasone with vancomycin and meropenem.<ref>Sanford Guide to antimicrobial therapy 2014 44th edition</ref> [[Pericarditis]] can appear, either as a septic pericarditis with grave prognosis or as a reactive pericarditis in the wake of meningitis or septicaemia.\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n===Meningitis===\nThe patient with meningococcal meningitis typically presents with high fever, [[nuchal rigidity]] (stiff neck), [[Kernig's sign]], severe headache, vomiting, [[purpura]], [[photophobia]], and sometimes chills, altered mental status, or seizures. Diarrhea or respiratory symptoms are less common. [[Petechiae]] are often also present, but do not always occur, so their absence should not be used against the diagnosis of meningococcal disease. Anyone with symptoms of meningococcal meningitis should receive intravenous antibiotics before the results of [[lumbar puncture]], as delay in treatment worsens the prognosis.\n\n===Meningococcemia===\nSymptoms of [[meningococcemia]] are, at least initially, similar to those of [[influenza]]. Typically, the first symptoms include fever, [[nausea]], myalgia, headache, [[arthralgia]], [[chills]], diarrhea, stiff neck, and malaise. Later symptoms include [[septic shock]], [[purpura]], hypotension, cyanosis, [[petechiae]], seizures, anxiety, and [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]]. [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome]] and altered mental status may also occur. The petechial rash appear with the 'star-like' shape. Meningococcal sepsis has a greater mortality rate than meningococcal meningitis, but the risk of neurologic sequelae is much lower.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n== Pathogenesis ==\nMeningococcal disease causes life-threatening meningitis and sepsis conditions. In the case of meningitis, bacteria attack the lining between the brain and skull called the [[meninges]]. Infected fluid from the meninges then passes into the [[spinal cord]], causing symptoms including stiff neck, [[fever]] and [[rash]]es. The meninges (and sometimes the brain itself) begin to swell, which affects the [[central nervous system]].\n\nEven with antibiotics, approximately 1 in 10 victims of meningococcal meningitis will die; however, about as many survivors of the disease lose a limb or [[deaf|their hearing]], or suffer permanent [[brain damage]].<ref name=\"Centersfor\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meningococcal disease among college students: ACIP modifies recommendations for meningitis vaccination. Press release. 1999 Oct 20</ref> The sepsis type of infection is much more deadly, and results in a severe [[blood poisoning]] called meningococcal sepsis that affects the entire body. In this case, bacterial toxins rupture blood vessels and can rapidly shut down vital organs. Within hours, patient's health can change from seemingly good to mortally ill.<ref name=\"Jeeri2012\">Jeeri R. Reddy and Thiombiano S. Rigobert.

Bull. 2007{{unreliable source?|date=July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe ''N. meningitidis'' bacterium is surrounded by a slimy outer coat that contains disease-causing [[Lipopolysaccharide|endotoxin]]. While many bacteria produce endotoxin, the levels produced by meningococcal bacteria are 100 to 1,000 times greater (and accordingly more lethal) than normal. As the bacteria multiply and move through the bloodstream, it sheds concentrated amounts of toxin. The endotoxin directly affects the heart, reducing its ability to circulate blood, and also causes pressure on blood vessels throughout the body. As some blood vessels start to [[hemorrhage]], major organs like the lungs and kidneys are damaged.\n\nPatients suffering from meningococcal disease are treated with a large dose of [[antibiotic]]. The systemic antibiotic flowing through the bloodstream rapidly kills the bacteria but, as the bacteria are killed, even more toxin is released. It takes up to several days for the toxin to be neutralized from the body by using continuous liquid treatment and antibiotic therapy.<ref name=\"Jeeri2012\" />\n\n== Prevention ==\nThe most important form of prevention is a vaccine against ''N. meningitidis''. Different countries have different strains of the bacteria and therefore use different vaccines. Twelve serogroups (strains) exist with six having the potential to cause a major epidemic - A, B, C, X, Y and W135 are responsible for virtually all cases of the disease in humans. Vaccines are currently available against all six strains, including the newest vaccine against serogroup B.

Close contacts are defined as those persons who could have had intimate contact with the patient's oral secretions such as through kissing or sharing of food or drink. The importance of the carrier state in meningococcal disease is well known. In developed countries the disease transmission usually occurs in day care, schools and large gatherings where usually disease transmission could occur. Because the meningococcal organism is transmitted by respiratory droplets and is susceptible to drying, it has been postulated that close contact is necessary for transmission. Therefore, the disease transmission to other susceptible person cannot be prevented. Meningitis occurs sporadically throughout the year, and since the organism has no known reservoir outside of man, asymptomatic carriers are usually the source of transmission.<ref>Control and Prevention of Meningococcal Disease: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP): VIRGINIA EPIDEMIOLOGY BULLETIN, July 1997, Volume 97, Number 7</ref>\n\nAdditionally, basic [[hygiene]] measures, such as handwashing and not sharing drinking cups, can reduce the incidence of infection by limiting exposure. When a case is confirmed, all close contacts with the infected person can be offered [[antibiotics]] to reduce the likelihood of the infection spreading to other people. However, rifampin-resistant strains have been reported and the indiscriminate use of antibiotics contributes to this problem. [[Chemoprophylaxis]] is commonly used to those close contacts who are at highest risk of carrying the pathogenic strains. Since vaccine duration is unknown, mass select vaccinations may be the most cost-effective means for controlling the transmission of the meningococcal disease, rather than mass routine vaccination schedules.<ref>Jeeri R.

Whenever sporadic or cluster cases or outbreaks of meningococcal disease occur in the US, [[chemoprophylaxis]] is the principal means of preventing secondary cases in household and other close contacts of individuals with invasive disease. Meningitis A, C, Y and W-135 vaccines rarely may be used as an adjunct to chemoprophylaxis,1 but only in situations where there is an ongoing risk of exposure (e.g., when cluster cases or outbreaks occur) and when a serogroup contained in the vaccine is involved.<ref name=ACIP05/>\n\nIt is important that clinicians promptly report all cases of suspected or confirmed meningococcal disease to local public health authorities and that the serogroup of the meningococcal strain involved be identified. The effectiveness of mass vaccination programs depends on early and accurate recognition of outbreaks. When a suspected outbreak of meningococcal disease occurs, public health authorities will then determine whether mass vaccinations (with or without mass chemoprophylaxis) is indicated and delineate the target population to be vaccinated based on risk assessment.<ref name=ACIP05/><ref name=Pediatrics05 />\n\n==Treatment ==\n[[File:Charlotte Cleverley-Bisman.jpg |thumb|[[Charlotte Cleverley-Bisman]], who had all four limbs partially amputated aged seven months due to meningococcal disease.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wane |first1=Joanna |title=The case for vaccination |url=http://www.biocsl.co.nz/docs/957/642/NorthSouth_case-for-accination.pdf |website=North & South |accessdate=July 3, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824083950/http://www.biocsl.co.nz/docs/957/642/NorthSouth_case-for-accination.pdf |archive-date=24 August 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>]]\nWhen meningococcal disease is suspected, treatment must be started ''immediately'' and should not be delayed while waiting for investigations. Treatment in primary care usually involves prompt intramuscular administration of [[benzylpenicillin]], and then an urgent transfer to hospital (hopefully, an academic level I medical center, or at least a hospital with round the clock neurological care, ideally with neurological intensive and critical care units) for further care. Once in the hospital, the antibiotics of choice are usually IV broad spectrum 3rd generation [[cephalosporins]], e.g., [[cefotaxime]] or [[ceftriaxone]]. Benzylpenicillin and [[chloramphenicol]] are also effective. Supportive measures include IV fluids, oxygen, inotropic support, e.g., dopamine or dobutamine and management of raised [[intracranial pressure]]. Steroid therapy may help in some adult patients, but is unlikely to affect long term outcomes.\n\nWhich antibiotic should be used immediately (before hospital admission) for suspected cases of meningococcal disease? A [[systematic review]] compared two antibiotics. There was one trial: an open label (not blinded) non-inferiority trial of 510 people comparing two different types of antibiotics; [[ceftriaxone]] (in which there were 14 deaths out of 247), and [[chloramphenicol]] (12 deaths out of 256).

Cases of meningococcemia leading to severe [[meningoencephalitis]] are common among young children and the elderly. Deaths occurring in less than 24 hours are more likely during the disease epidemic seasons in Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa is hit by meningitis disease outbreaks throughout the epidemic season.

This is an area of Africa where the disease is endemic: meningitis is \"silently\" present, and there are always a few cases. When the number of cases passes five per population of 100,000 in one week, teams are on alert. Epidemic levels are reached when there have been 100 cases per 100,000 populations over several weeks.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/ Meningococcal meningitis]</ref>\n\nFurther complicating efforts to halt the spread of meningitis in Africa is the fact that extremely dry, dusty weather conditions which characterize Niger and Burkina Faso from December to June favor the development of epidemics. Overcrowded villages are breeding grounds for bacterial transmission and lead to a high prevalence of respiratory tract infections, which leave the body more susceptible to infection, encouraging the spread of meningitis.
