It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.\n\n* '''Kal Yuga''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following [[Dharma]] and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished. Families become non-existent. The Kali Yuga is the end of cycle and its end marks the start of the Satya Yuga of the next cycle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Duration of the four Yugas==\n[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|left|thumb|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]\n\nThe duration of yugas is traditionally believed to be a 4,320,00 year long cycle. In modern times,a shorter cycle is written as 24,000 years by another author is more commonly accepted as 25,772 years because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system {{Original research|date=February 2020}}. However, the traditional timescale is widely accepted within India.\n\n==The Traditional cycle of Yugas==\n\nThe traditional cycle of the Yugas has been mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and it is widely accepted since ancient times. The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga.  The Yuga cycle contains 4 yugas (ages) - Satya Yuga, Dwapar, Treta and Kali Yuga.\n\nThe age of Kali Yuga = '''432,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Dwapar Yuga = 432,000 * 2 = '''864,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Treta Yuga = 432,000 * 3 = '''1,296,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Satya Yuga = 432,000 * 4 = '''1,728,000 years'''\n\nOne Mahayuga is the entire one cycle = 4,320,000 years. 1000 Mahayugas is equal to one day of Lord [[Brahma]]. His night is of equal duration. So the entrie day of Brahma becomes - \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 years and passes away and the universe ends. A new Brahma is born and creates the universe again. \n\nSo the entire duration of life of universe is -\n\n8,640,000,000 * 365 * 100 = '''315,360,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nThis shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Jaggi Vasudev]] and [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle.meaning that the following calculation relating to Mahayugas is erroneously used:\n\n* Satya Yuga = 4800 \u00d7 360 = 1,728,000 years\n* Treta Yuga = 3600 \u00d7 360 = 1,296,000 years\n* Dvapara Yuga = 2400 \u00d7 360 = 864,000 years\n* Kali Yuga = 1200 \u00d7 360 = 432,000 years\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 438,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE).

It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.\n\n* '''Kal Yuga''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following [[Dharma]] and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished. Families become non-existent. The Kali Yuga is the end of cycle and its end marks the start of the Satya Yuga of the next cycle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Duration of the four Yugas==\n[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|left|thumb|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]\n\nThe duration of yugas is traditionally believed to be a 4,320,000 year long cycle. In modern times,a shorter cycle is written as 24,000 years by another author is more commonly accepted as 25,772 years because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system {{Original research|date=February 2020}}. However, the traditional timescale is widely accepted within India. \n\n==The Traditional cycle of Yugas==\n\nThe traditional cycle of the Yugas has been mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and it is widely accepted since ancient times. The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga.  The Yuga cycle contains 4 yugas (ages) - Satya Yuga, Dwapar, Treta and Kali Yuga.\n\nThe age of Kali Yuga = '''432,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Dwapar Yuga = 432,000 * 2 = '''864,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Treta Yuga = 432,000 * 3 = '''1,296,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Satya Yuga = 432,000 * 4 = '''1,728,000 years'''\n\nOne Mahayuga is the entire one cycle = 4,320,000 years. 1000 Mahayugas is equal to one day of Lord [[Brahma]]. His night is of equal duration. So the entrie day of Brahma becomes - \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 years and passes away and the universe ends. A new Brahma is born and creates the universe again. \n\nSo the entire duration of life of universe is -\n\n8,640,000,000 * 365 * 100 = '''315,360,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nThis shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Jaggi Vasudev]] and [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle.meaning that the following calculation relating to Mahayugas is erroneously used:\n\n* Satya Yuga = 4800 \u00d7 360 = 1,728,000 years\n* Treta Yuga = 3600 \u00d7 360 = 1,296,000 years\n* Dvapara Yuga = 2400 \u00d7 360 = 864,000 years\n* Kali Yuga = 1200 \u00d7 360 = 432,000 years\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 438,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE). This originated during the puranic times when the famous astronomer Aryabhatta recalculated the timeline by artificially inflating the traditional 12,000 year figure with a multiplication of 360, which was represented as the number of \"human years\" that make up a single \"divine year\". This was likely a purposeful miscalculation due to conflicts with one of the preeminent astronomer of the time [[Brahmagupta]].
