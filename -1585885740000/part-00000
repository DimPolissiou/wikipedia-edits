Cloning in [[biotechnology]] refers to the process of creating clones of organisms or copies of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[DNA]] fragments ([[molecular cloning]]). Beyond [[biology]], the term refers to the production of multiple copies of [[digital media]] or [[software]]\n\nThe term '''clone''', coined by [[Herbert J.

Cloning is commonly used to amplify [[DNA]] fragments containing whole [[genes]], but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]], non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from [[genetic fingerprinting]] to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in [[positional cloning]]. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an [[origin of replication]], which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised [[cloning vector]]s (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow [[protein production]], [[affinity tag]]ging, single stranded [[RNA]] or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.\n\nCloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps<ref>{{cite book |title=iGenetics: A Molecular Approach |author=Peter J. Russel |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8053-4665-7 |location=San Francisco, California, United States of America |publisher=Pearson Education |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/igeneticsmolecul0000russ }}</ref>\n# fragmentation - breaking apart a strand of DNA\n# [[DNA ligase|ligation]] - gluing together pieces of DNA in a desired sequence\n# [[transfection]] \u2013 inserting the newly formed pieces of DNA into cells\n# screening/selection \u2013 selecting out the cells that were successfully transfected with the new DNA\n\nAlthough these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected; these are summarized as a ''cloning strategy''.\n\nInitially, the DNA of interest needs to be isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a [[vector (molecular biology)|vector]] (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using [[restriction enzyme]]s, and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called [[DNA ligase]]. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, [[electroporation]], [[optical injection]] and [[biolistics]]. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable [[antibiotic]] resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on [[X-gal]] medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of [[PCR]], restriction fragment analysis and/or [[DNA sequencing]].\n\n== Cell cloning{{Anchor|Cellular cloning}}==\n\n===Cloning unicellular organisms===\n[[File:Human cell-line colony being cloned in vitro through use of cloning rings.jpg|right|thumb|Cloning cell-line colonies using cloning rings]]\nCloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell. In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the [[inoculation]] of the appropriate medium. However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media.\n\nA useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings (cylinders).<ref name=\"CloningRings\">{{cite journal|last=McFarland|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas McFarland|year=2000|title= Preparation of pure cell cultures by cloning|journal=Methods in Cell Science|volume=22|issue=1|pages=63\u201366|pmid=10650336|doi= 10.1023/A:1009838416621}}</ref> In this technique a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a [[mutagen|mutagenic agent]] or drug used to drive [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies, each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few cells, sterile [[polystyrene]] rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease, are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of [[trypsin]] is added. Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth.\n\n=== Cloning stem cells ===\n{{Main|Somatic-cell nuclear transfer}}\n[[Somatic-cell nuclear transfer]], popularly known as SCNT, can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in [[stem cell research]]. This process is also called \"research cloning\" or \"therapeutic cloning\". The goal is not to create cloned human beings (called \"reproductive cloning\"), but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease. While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2008/01/california_biot.html|title=California biotech says it cloned a human embryo, but no stem cells produced|first=Gideon|last=Gil|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=2008-01-17}}</ref>\n\nTherapeutic cloning is achieved by creating embryonic stem cells in the hopes of treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned.<ref name=\"Halim\">{{cite web |last=Halim |first=N. |date=September 2002 |title=Extensive new study shows abnormalities in cloned animals |accessdate=31 October 2011 |publisher=Massachusetts institute of technology |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/cloning-0911.html}}</ref> In the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease, the nucleus from a skin cell of that patient is placed into an empty egg. The reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus. The embryo will become genetically identical to the patient.<ref name=Halim /> The embryo will then form a blastocyst which has the potential to form/become any cell in the body.<ref name=\"Plus\">{{cite web |last=Plus |first=M. |year=2011 |title= Fetal development |accessdate=31 October 2011 |url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002398.htm |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov }}</ref>\n\nThe reason why SCNT is used for cloning is because somatic cells can be easily acquired and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to remember is that cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor's somatic cell nucleus.<ref name=\"Latham\">{{cite web |last=Latham |first=K. E. |year=2005 |title=Early and delayed aspects of nuclear reprogramming during cloning |publisher=Biology of the Cell |pages=97, 119\u2013132 |url=http://submit.biolcell.org/boc/097/0119/0970119.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802122210/http://submit.biolcell.org/boc/097/0119/0970119.pdf |archivedate=2 August 2014}}</ref> The oocyte will react on the somatic cell nucleus, the same way it would on sperm cells.<ref name=Latham />\n\nThe process of cloning a particular farm animal using SCNT is relatively the same for all animals. The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use.<ref name=Latham /> The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm.<ref name=Latham /> This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current.<ref name=Latham /> This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.<ref name=Latham />\n\nSCNT is seen as a good method for producing agriculture animals for food consumption. It successfully cloned sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Another benefit is SCNT is seen as a solution to clone endangered species that are on the verge of going extinct.<ref name=Latham /> However, stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus can be enormous, which led to a high loss in resulting cells in early research. For example, [[Dolly (sheep)|the cloned sheep Dolly]] was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell KH, McWhir J, Ritchie WA, Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64\u20136 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8598906 |doi=10.1038/380064a0 |bibcode=1996Natur.380...64C }}</ref> As the procedure could not be automated, and had to be performed manually under a [[microscope]], SCNT was very resource intensive.

The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus.\n\n== Organism cloning ==\n{{See also|Asexual reproduction|Cuttings (plants)|vegetative reproduction}}\n'''Organism cloning''' (also called reproductive cloning) refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used. However, cloning, or asexual propagation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/misc/asexualpropagation.html |title=Asexual Propagation |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |accessdate=2010-08-04}}</ref> has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.\n\n=== Horticultural ===\n[[File:Vine shoots.JPG|thumb|Propagating plants from [[cuttings (plants)|cuttings]], such as grape vines, is an ancient form of cloning]]\n{{For|the use of cloning in viticulture|Propagation of grapevines}}\nThe term ''clone'' is used in horticulture to refer to descendants of a single plant which were produced by [[vegetative reproduction]] or [[apomixis]].

The growth and development occurs without fertilization by a male. In plants, parthenogenesis means the development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell, and is a component process of apomixis. In species that use the [[XY sex-determination system]], the offspring will always be female. An example is the little fire ant (''[[Wasmannia auropunctata]]''), which is native to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] but has spread throughout many tropical environments.\n\n=== Artificial cloning of organisms ===\nArtificial cloning of organisms may also be called ''reproductive cloning''.\n\n==== First steps ====\n[[Hans Spemann]], a [[Germans|German]] [[embryologist]] was awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1935 for his discovery of the effect now known as embryonic induction, exercised by various parts of the embryo, that directs the development of groups of cells into particular tissues and organs. In 1928 he and his student, [[Hilde Mangold]], were the first to perform [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] using [[amphibian]] embryos \u2013 one of the first steps towards cloning.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=De Robertis|first1=EM|title=Spemann's organizer and self-regulation in amphibian embryos|journal=Nature Reviews.

This process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell (somatic cell) to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, or to a cell from a [[blastocyst]] from which the nucleus has been removed.<ref name=HumanGenomeInfo>{{cite web|title=Cloning Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|publisher=Human Genome Project Information|accessdate=25 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|archivedate=2 May 2013}}</ref> If the egg begins to divide normally it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother. Such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA. Additionally, the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in the [[cytoplasm]] also contains DNA and during SCNT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donor's egg, thus the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced. This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death.\n\nArtificial ''embryo splitting'' or ''embryo twinning'', a technique that creates monozygotic twins from a single embryo, is not considered in the same fashion as other methods of cloning. During that procedure, a donor [[embryo]] is split in two distinct embryos, that can then be transferred via [[embryo transfer]]. It is optimally performed at the 6- to 8-cell stage, where it can be used as an expansion of [[IVF]] to increase the number of available embryos.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil.

In a bovine experiment involving 70 cloned calves, one-third of the calves died quite young. The first successfully cloned horse, [[Prometea]], took 814 attempts. Notably, although the first{{clarify|does this mean \"first vertebrate\"?|date=February 2016}} clones were frogs, no adult cloned frog has yet been produced from a somatic adult nucleus donor cell.\n\nThere were early claims that [[Dolly the sheep]] had pathologies resembling accelerated aging. Scientists speculated that Dolly's death in 2003 was related to the shortening of [[telomere]]s, DNA-protein complexes that protect the end of linear [[chromosome]]s. However, other researchers, including [[Ian Wilmut]] who led the team that successfully cloned Dolly, argue that Dolly's early death due to respiratory infection was unrelated to problems with the cloning process. This idea that the nuclei have not irreversibly aged was shown in 2013 to be true for mice.<ref name=\"Wakayama\" />\n\nDolly was named after performer [[Dolly Parton]] because the cells cloned to make her were from a [[mammary gland]] cell, and Parton is known for her ample cleavage.<ref name=BBCname>BBC. 22 February 2008.

Cloning is commonly used to amplify [[DNA]] fragments containing whole [[genes]], but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]], non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from [[genetic fingerprinting]] to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in [[positional cloning]]. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an [[origin of replication]], which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised [[cloning vector]]s (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow [[protein production]], [[affinity tag]]ging, single stranded [[RNA]] or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.\n\nCloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps<ref>{{cite book |title=iGenetics: A Molecular Approach |author=Peter J. Russel |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8053-4665-7 |location=San Francisco, California, United States of America |publisher=Pearson Education |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/igeneticsmolecul0000russ }}</ref>\n# fragmentation - breaking apart a strand of DNA\n# [[DNA ligase|ligation]] - gluing together pieces of DNA in a desired sequence\n# [[transfection]] \u2013 inserting the newly formed pieces of DNA into cells\n# screening/selection \u2013 selecting out the cells that were successfully transfected with the new DNA\n\nAlthough these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected; these are summarized as a ''cloning strategy''.\n\nInitially, the DNA of interest needs to be isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a [[vector (molecular biology)|vector]] (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using [[restriction enzyme]]s, and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called [[DNA ligase]]. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, [[electroporation]], [[optical injection]] and [[biolistics]]. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable [[antibiotic]] resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on [[X-gal]] medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of [[PCR]], restriction fragment analysis and/or [[DNA sequencing]].\n\n== Cell cloning{{Anchor|Cellular cloning}}==\n\n===Cloning unicellular organisms===\n[[File:Human cell-line colony being cloned in vitro through use of cloning rings.jpg|right|thumb|Cloning cell-line colonies using cloning rings]]\nCloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell. In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the [[inoculation]] of the appropriate medium. However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media.\n\nA useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings (cylinders).<ref name=\"CloningRings\">{{cite journal|last=McFarland|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas McFarland|year=2000|title= Preparation of pure cell cultures by cloning|journal=Methods in Cell Science|volume=22|issue=1|pages=63\u201366|pmid=10650336|doi= 10.1023/A:1009838416621}}</ref> In this technique a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a [[mutagen|mutagenic agent]] or drug used to drive [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies, each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few cells, sterile [[polystyrene]] rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease, are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of [[trypsin]] is added. Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth.\n\n=== Cloning stem cells ===\n{{Main|Somatic-cell nuclear transfer}}\n[[Somatic-cell nuclear transfer]], popularly known as SCNT, can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in [[stem cell research]]. This process is also called \"research cloning\" or \"therapeutic cloning\". The goal is not to create cloned human beings (called \"reproductive cloning\"), but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease. While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2008/01/california_biot.html|title=California biotech says it cloned a human embryo, but no stem cells produced|first=Gideon|last=Gil|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=2008-01-17}}</ref>\n\nTherapeutic cloning is achieved by creating embryonic stem cells in the hopes of treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned.<ref name=\"Halim\">{{cite web |last=Halim |first=N. |date=September 2002 |title=Extensive new study shows abnormalities in cloned animals |accessdate=31 October 2011 |publisher=Massachusetts institute of technology |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/cloning-0911.html}}</ref> In the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease, the nucleus from a skin cell of that patient is placed into an empty egg.

This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to remember is that cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor's somatic cell nucleus.<ref name=\"Latham\">{{cite web |last=Latham |first=K.

The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use.<ref name=Latham /> The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm.<ref name=Latham /> This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current.<ref name=Latham /> This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.<ref name=Latham />\n\nSCNT is seen as a good method for producing agriculture animals for food consumption. It successfully cloned sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Another benefit is SCNT is seen as a solution to clone endangered species that are on the verge of going extinct.<ref name=Latham /> However, stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus can be enormous, which led to a high loss in resulting cells in early research. For example, [[Dolly (sheep)|the cloned sheep Dolly]] was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell KH, McWhir J, Ritchie WA, Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64\u20136 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8598906 |doi=10.1038/380064a0 |bibcode=1996Natur.380...64C }}</ref> As the procedure could not be automated, and had to be performed manually under a [[microscope]], SCNT was very resource intensive.

The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus.\n\n== Organism cloning ==\n{{See also|Asexual reproduction|Cuttings (plants)|vegetative reproduction}}\n'''Organism cloning''' (also called reproductive cloning) refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used. However, cloning, or asexual propagation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/misc/asexualpropagation.html |title=Asexual Propagation |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |accessdate=2010-08-04}}</ref> has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.\n\n=== Horticultural ===\n[[File:Vine shoots.JPG|thumb|Propagating plants from [[cuttings (plants)|cuttings]], such as grape vines, is an ancient form of cloning]]\n{{For|the use of cloning in viticulture|Propagation of grapevines}}\nThe term ''clone'' is used in horticulture to refer to descendants of a single plant which were produced by [[vegetative reproduction]] or [[apomixis]]. Many horticultural plant [[cultivar]]s are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction.<ref>Sagers, Larry A.

Parts of an individual plant may become detached by [[Fragmentation (cell biology)|fragmentation]] and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of [[gemma (botany)|gemmae]]. Some vascular plants e.g. [[dandelion]] and certain [[viviparity|viviparous]] grasses also form [[seed]]s asexually, termed [[apomixis]], resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.\n\n=== Parthenogenesis ===\nClonal derivation exists in nature in some animal species and is referred to as [[parthenogenesis]] (reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate). This is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects, crustaceans, nematodes,<ref>Castagnone-Sereno P, et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23682915 Diversity and evolution of root-knot nematodes, genus Meloidogyne: new insights from the genomic era] Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2013;51:203-20</ref> fish (for example the [[hammerhead shark]]<ref name =\"NYT Shubin\">Shubin, Neil (24 February 2008) [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/opinion/24shubin.html Birds Do It.

The growth and development occurs without fertilization by a male. In plants, parthenogenesis means the development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell, and is a component process of apomixis. In species that use the [[XY sex-determination system]], the offspring will always be female. An example is the little fire ant (''[[Wasmannia auropunctata]]''), which is native to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] but has spread throughout many tropical environments.\n\n=== Artificial cloning of organisms ===\nArtificial cloning of organisms may also be called ''reproductive cloning''.\n\n==== First steps ====\n[[Hans Spemann]], a [[Germans|German]] [[embryologist]] was awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1935 for his discovery of the effect now known as embryonic induction, exercised by various parts of the embryo, that directs the development of groups of cells into particular tissues and organs.

This process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell (somatic cell) to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, or to a cell from a [[blastocyst]] from which the nucleus has been removed.<ref name=HumanGenomeInfo>{{cite web|title=Cloning Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|publisher=Human Genome Project Information|accessdate=25 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|archivedate=2 May 2013}}</ref> If the egg begins to divide normally it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother. Such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA. Additionally, the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in the [[cytoplasm]] also contains DNA and during SCNT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donor's egg, thus the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced. This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death.\n\nArtificial ''embryo splitting'' or ''embryo twinning'', a technique that creates monozygotic twins from a single embryo, is not considered in the same fashion as other methods of cloning. During that procedure, a donor [[embryo]] is split in two distinct embryos, that can then be transferred via [[embryo transfer]]. It is optimally performed at the 6- to 8-cell stage, where it can be used as an expansion of [[IVF]] to increase the number of available embryos.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil.

In a bovine experiment involving 70 cloned calves, one-third of the calves died quite young. The first successfully cloned horse, [[Prometea]], took 814 attempts. Notably, although the first{{clarify|does this mean \"first vertebrate\"?|date=February 2016}} clones were frogs, no adult cloned frog has yet been produced from a somatic adult nucleus donor cell.\n\nThere were early claims that [[Dolly the sheep]] had pathologies resembling accelerated aging. Scientists speculated that Dolly's death in 2003 was related to the shortening of [[telomere]]s, DNA-protein complexes that protect the end of linear [[chromosome]]s. However, other researchers, including [[Ian Wilmut]] who led the team that successfully cloned Dolly, argue that Dolly's early death due to respiratory infection was unrelated to problems with the cloning process. This idea that the nuclei have not irreversibly aged was shown in 2013 to be true for mice.<ref name=\"Wakayama\" />\n\nDolly was named after performer [[Dolly Parton]] because the cells cloned to make her were from a [[mammary gland]] cell, and Parton is known for her ample cleavage.<ref name=BBCname>BBC. 22 February 2008.

The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissues. It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of [[monozygotic|identical]] [[multiple birth|twins]].  The possibility of human cloning has raised [[ethics of cloning|controversies]]. These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass [[legislation]] regarding human cloning and its legality. As of right now, scientists have no intention of trying to clone people and they believe their results should spark a wider discussion about the laws and regulations the world needs to regulate cloning.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=Bobby|title=WATCH: Scientists clone monkeys using technique that created Dolly the sheep|url=http://fox61.com/2018/01/25/watch-scientists-clone-monkeys-using-technique-that-created-dolly-the-sheep/|website=Fox61|publisher=fox61|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=2018-01-26}}</ref>\n\nTwo commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are ''therapeutic cloning'' and ''reproductive cloning''. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, {{as of|2014|lc=y}}. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] and, more recently, [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent stem cell induction]].

The process is applied to fertilized human [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] ''[[in vitro]]'', causing them to split into identical genetic copies of the original.<ref>Huxley, Aldous; \"Brave New World and Brave New World Revisited\"; p. 19; HarperPerennial, 2005.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Bhelkar|first1=Ratnakar D.|title=Science Fiction: Fantasy and Reality|date=2009|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Dist|isbn=9788126910366|page=58|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bvt_NyXYGb0C&lpg=PA58&pg=PA58|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}</ref> Following renewed interest in cloning in the 1950s, the subject was explored further in works such as [[Poul Anderson]]'s 1953 story ''UN-Man'', which describes a technology called \"exogenesis\", and [[Gordon Rattray Taylor]]'s book ''[[The Biological Time Bomb]]'', which popularised the term \"cloning\" in 1963.<ref name=\"stableford\">{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian M.|title=Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9780415974608|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sciencefactscien0000stab/page/91 91\u201392]|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uefwmdROKTAC&lpg=PA92&pg=PA91|language=en|chapter=Clone|url=https://archive.org/details/sciencefactscien0000stab/page/91}}</ref>\n\nCloning is a recurring theme in a number of contemporary science fiction films, ranging from action films such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' (1997), ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000), ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' (2002), ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'' (2005) and ''[[Moon (film)|Moon]]'' (2009) to comedies such as [[Woody Allen]]'s 1973 film ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070707/|title=Sleeper (1973)|author=planktonrules|date=17 December 1973|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe process of cloning is represented variously in fiction. Many works depict the artificial creation of humans by a method of growing cells from a tissue or DNA sample; the replication may be instantaneous, or take place through slow growth of human embryos in [[artificial womb]]s. In the long-running British television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the [[Fourth Doctor]] and his companion [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]] were cloned in a matter of seconds from DNA samples (\"[[The Invisible Enemy (Doctor Who)|The Invisible Enemy]]\", 1977) and then \u2013 in an apparent [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the 1966 film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' \u2014 shrunk to microscopic size in order to enter the Doctor's body to combat an alien virus.

It is part of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series and follows ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' (1992). After [[Doctor Robotnik]]'s spaceship, the Death Egg, crash-lands on a mysterious floating island, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and [[Tails (character)|Tails]] attempt to retrieve the [[Chaos Emeralds]] to stop it from relaunching. ''Sonic 3'' introduces [[Knuckles the Echidna]], the island guardian, who lays traps for Sonic and Tails. Gameplay is similar to previous entries, with players traversing [[side-scrolling]] levels at high speeds while collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies.\n\nDevelopment began in January 1993, shortly after the release of ''Sonic 2''. It was initially developed as an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric]] game similar to ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' (1996), but became a conventional 2D platformer due to time constraints. ''Sonic 3''{{'s}} production took place simultaneously with ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]''; they were developed as a single game until time constraints and cartridge costs forced the developers to split it. The ''Sonic 3'' cartridge can be attached to an adapter on the ''Sonic & Knuckles'' cartridge, creating a combined game, ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles''. Pop musician [[Michael Jackson]] reportedly composed portions of the soundtrack, but left the project and went uncredited when Brad added extra melodies to the track Jackson  decided not to use them in the project.\n\n''Sonic 3'' was released for the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America and Europe in February 1994, and in Japan the following May. As with its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success, with critics seeing it as an improvement over previous installments. It sold over one million copies in the United States, making it one of the [[bestselling Genesis games]]. Alongside ''Sonic & Knuckles'', a [[Windows]] port was released through the ''[[Sonic & Knuckles Collection]]'' (1997). The game has also been rereleased via [[Video game emulation|emulation]] and [[product bundling|compilations]] for various platforms, including ''[[Sonic Mega Collection]]'' (2002) and ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' (2009).\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Sonic3 Hydrocity.png|thumb|240px|left|Sonic and Tails exploring the underwater portion of Hydrocity, the second zone]]\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]]. Players can control Sonic, Tails, or both. In the latter choice, players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him; a second player can join at any time and control Tails separately.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\" /> ''Sonic 3'' adds the ability for Tails to fly for a short time by spinning his twin tails like helicopter rotor;<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\" /> when he tires, he falls.

Levels are populated with Robotnik's robots, called \"badniks\"; Sonic and Tails can defeat badniks by jumping on them or using the \"spin dash\" attack, which also gives the character a speed boost.<ref name=\"m89\" /> The levels include obstacles and other features such as [[vertical loop]]s, corkscrews, breakable walls, spikes, water that the player can drown in, and bottomless pits.<ref name=\"game\">{{cite video game|title=Sonic the Hedgehog 3|developer=Sonic Team|publisher=Sega|date=February 2, 1994}}</ref> There is a [[miniboss]] fight with one of Robotnik's large, powerful robots at the end of the first act of each level and a full [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight with Robotnik at the end of the second.<ref name=\"m45\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> Reaching a new level [[Autosave|saves]] the game to one of six save slots.<ref name=\"m10\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 10.</ref>\n\nAs with previous ''Sonic'' games, ''Sonic 3'' uses [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]], scattered throughout the levels, as a health system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a [[health (gaming)|life]] and return to the most recently passed [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoint]]. Dying with zero lives gives the player a [[game over]]. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an [[1-up|extra life]], temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings,<ref name=\"m1213\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 12\u201313.</ref> a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.<ref name=\"palgn\" />\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | alt1 =\n | alt2 =\n | footer_align = left\n | image1 = Sonic 3 Special Stage.png\n | width1 = 240\n | caption1 = Tails in one of the special stages, in which the player can earn [[Chaos Emeralds]]\n | image2 = S3 special stage mechanics.svg\n | width2 = 240\n | caption2 = A diagram of how rings are generated by walking the perimeter of a group of blue spheres\n}}\n\n''Sonic 3'' contains two types of \"special stages\".

Both sides of the corridor are lined with flippers, which disappear when the character bounces on them, and the switch drops when both flippers supporting it are removed. The corridor's floor contains a bounce pad, which also disappears after one use; falling afterwards causes the player to leave the stage with the most recent power-up collected.<ref name=\"m1415\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nThe second type, triggered by entering giant rings found in secret passages, involves running around a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] map and passing through all of a number of blue spheres arranged in patterns. Passing through a blue sphere turns it red, and touching a red sphere causes the player to leave the stage, unless the player has just completed a cycle around an arrangement of blue spheres, in which case all of these spheres turn to harmless rings. Removing all of the blue spheres gives the player a [[Chaos Emerald]]; if Sonic (not Tails) collects all seven, he can become [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Common features|Super Sonic]] at will, which makes him invincible to most obstacles.<ref name=\"palgn\" /><ref name=\"super\">{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Jahanzeb|title=20 Years Ago: Sonic 3 & Knuckles|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/04/11/20-years-ago-sonic-knuckles/80530/|publisher=Hardcore Gamer|accessdate=January 4, 2015|date=April 2014}}</ref> Failing to collect the seven Chaos Emeralds triggers a [[post-credits scene]] in which Robotnik and Knuckles taunt the player.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Sonic the Hedgehog 3|developer=Sonic Team|publisher=Sega|platform=Genesis/Mega Drive|scene=Ending sequence|date=1994}}</ref>\n\n''Sonic 3'' includes a competitive mode: two players, controlling Sonic, Tails, or [[Knuckles the Echidna]], race through one or all of five stages that do not appear in the main game.

It holds a score of 89 percent at review aggregator [[GameRankings]] based on five reviews.<ref name=\"gr_s3\"/> Critics generally felt ''Sonic 3'' was the best game in the series so far. Andrew Humphreys of ''[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]'', who declared himself not a ''Sonic'' fan, said it was \"undoubtedly\" the best of the series, including the acclaimed but obscure ''Sonic CD'', though he admitted having preferred ''Sonic 2''{{'s}} special stages by a small margin.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine|Sega Magazine]]'', however, stated that ''Sonic 3'' has better special stages and was not only superior to ''Sonic 2'' as a whole but would be \"a serious contender for the Best Platform Game Ever award\".<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''[[Sega Power]]'' wrote that despite their skepticism, they found it \"excellent\" and easily \"the most explorable and playable\" in the series.<ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' also compared ''Sonic 3'' favorably to ''Sonic 1'', ''2'', and ''CD'' and awarded it their \"Game of the Month\" award.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/> They later ranked it number 1 in The EGM Hot 50, indicating that it received the highest average score of any game they had reviewed in the past year.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The EGM Hot 50 |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=69 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=April 1995 |pages=44\u201348}}</ref> Lucas M. Thomas of IGN stated that ''Sonic 3'' \"completed the trilogy as the best of them all\".<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/> Dan Whitehead of ''[[Eurogamer]],'' however, considered ''Sonic & Knuckles'' superior.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Lionel Vilner of ''[[:fr:Gen4|G\u00e9n\u00e9ration 4]]'' believed ''Sonic 3'' offered more challenge than its predecessors.<ref name=\"G4Rev\"/> The Unknown Gamer of ''[[GamePro]]'' proclaimed that it \"proves that you can teach an old hedgehog new and exciting tricks. Take that old ''Sonic'' magic, add fun new variations, and you have another spectacular game.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nSome critics felt that ''Sonic 3'' had innovated too little from previous ''Sonic'' games. Humphreys of ''Hyper'' saw only \"a few new features\"<ref name=\"hyper\"/> while ''Sega Power'' thought it was \"not all that different\"<ref name=\"power\"/> and Nintendo Life writer Damien McFerran said that \"there's not a lot of new elements here to be brutally frank\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/> While Deniz Ahmet of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' agreed that the game was \"more of the same\", he was placated by the new and imaginative ideas.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> Frank Provo of ''[[GameSpot]]'' stated that the most significant addition was its save system.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> However, he and ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' also both enjoyed the new power-ups.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> Many aspects of the level design were praised; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' and ''Sega Power'' enjoyed the expansive stages, secret areas, much less linear level design, and difficulty.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Mean Machines]]'' agreed, describing the game as \"a rollercoaster ride from start to finish\" and listing Carnival Night as their favorite level, which they described as \"probably the most slickly programmed portion of game in Megadrive history\".<ref name=\"mean\"/> Humphreys and ''Mean Machines'' felt that the game was too short, but they and ''Sega Magazine'' felt that its two-player mode and the Emerald collecting would significantly extend the [[replay value]].<ref name=\"hyper\"/><ref name=\"mean\"/><ref name=\"sm\"/> On the other hand, Whitehead said that the large stages would keep players sufficiently engrossed.<ref name=\"euro\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' also enjoyed having the ability to play as Knuckles in the two-player mode.<ref name=\"sm\"/> The Unknown Gamer felt that while the two-player mode was less fun than the main game, it was much improved over that of its predecessor due to the change of format from split-screen to full-screen.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nThe visuals were very well received. Humphreys described ''Sonic 3'' as \"one of the most beautiful games around\" and full of \"flashy new visual tricks\", highlighting Sonic's ascension up pipes and spiraling pathways as particularly inventive.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' exclaimed that its graphics were \"brilliant\" even for a ''Sonic'' game,<ref name=\"sm\"/> while Provo praised the \"elaborate\" backgrounds.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> ''Mean Machines'' thought similarly, giving special praise to the camera's quick scrolling, the diversity of the level themes, and the \"chunkier, more detailed\" overall aesthetic.<ref name=\"mean\"/> Rik Skews of ''Computer and Video Games'' stated that \"the graphics were stunning, attention to detail is breathtaking\". Ahmet of the same publication also noted that the graphics were more detailed than those of previous installments.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> The Unknown Gamer described the settings as having \"gorgeous background detail and lots of visual treats\" and was impressed by the new obstacles that Sonic can traverse at top speeds.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas and Provo especially enjoyed the use of wordless cutscenes to create a coherent story and thematically connect the zones.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> McFerran, however, felt that the visuals had been downgraded, particularly Sonic's \"dumpier\" sprite and \"the infamous 'dotty' textures\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/>\n\nThe sound effects and music were also well received, though somewhat less so than the visuals. ''Sega Magazine'' described them as \"brilliant\" and \"far superior\" to ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''Mean Machines'' stated that every level had \"great tunes\" and sound effects and particularly praised the ending music.<ref name=\"mean\"/> However, Humphreys described the sound as \"Sonicky ... with the emphasis on the 'icky'\"; he also found it strikingly similar to the first two ''Sonic'' games' soundtracks.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> The Unknown Gamer also saw musical similarity to previous installments, and described the individual tracks as \"catchy... until you've heard it a hundred times.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas thought the music was \"impressive\", but not quite on par with ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/>\n\nReviews of ports have been slightly less positive; the Xbox 360 release has scores of 78% and 79% at GameRankings and [[Metacritic]], respectively.<ref name=\"mc x360\"/> Some critics, such as Adam Ghiggino of [[PALGN]], felt ''Sonic 3'' had been insufficiently upgraded for re-releases;<ref name=\"palgn\"/> Whitehead of ''Eurogamer'' wished online co-op had been implemented.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Provo of GameSpot and Thomas of IGN wished Sega had re-released ''Sonic 3'' and ''Sonic & Knuckles'' together as ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' instead.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/>\n\n''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' ranked it the fifth best Genesis game ever in November 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Mega |issue=26 |page=74 |publisher=[[Maverick Magazines]] |date=November 1994}}</ref> In 2014, [[GamesRadar]] ranked ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' as the seventh best Genesis game;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/best-sega-genesis-games-all-time/ |publisher=GamesRadar |title=Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time |author=GamesRadar Staff |date=August 14, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> in 2013, Jeremy Parish of ''[[Eurogamer|US Gamer]]'' ranked it eighth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-best-genesis-and-sega-cd-games |website=[[Eurogamer]] |title=The 10 Best Genesis/Mega Drive and Top 5 Sega CD Games |last=Parish |first=Jeremy |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Sonic 3'' was the first appearance of [[Knuckles the Echidna]], who would be featured prominently in future ''Sonic'' games.

It is part of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series and follows ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' (1992). After [[Doctor Robotnik]]'s spaceship, the Death Egg, crash-lands on a mysterious floating island, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and [[Tails (character)|Tails]] attempt to retrieve the [[Chaos Emeralds]] to stop it from relaunching. ''Sonic 3'' introduces [[Knuckles the Echidna]], the island guardian, who lays traps for Sonic and Tails. Gameplay is similar to previous entries, with players traversing [[side-scrolling]] levels at high speeds while collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies.\n\nDevelopment began in January 1993, shortly after the release of ''Sonic 2''. It was initially developed as an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric]] game similar to ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' (1996), but became a conventional 2D platformer due to time constraints. ''Sonic 3''{{'s}} production took place simultaneously with ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]''; they were developed as a single game until time constraints and cartridge costs forced the developers to split it. The ''Sonic 3'' cartridge can be attached to an adapter on the ''Sonic & Knuckles'' cartridge, creating a combined game, ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles''. Pop musician [[Michael Jackson]] reportedly composed portions of the soundtrack, but left the project and went uncredited.\n\n''Sonic 3'' was released for the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America and Europe in February 1994, and in Japan the following May. As with its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success, with critics seeing it as an improvement over previous installments. It sold over one million copies in the United States, making it one of the [[bestselling Genesis games]]. Alongside ''Sonic & Knuckles'', a [[Windows]] port was released through the ''[[Sonic & Knuckles Collection]]'' (1997). The game has also been rereleased via [[Video game emulation|emulation]] and [[product bundling|compilations]] for various platforms, including ''[[Sonic Mega Collection]]'' (2002) and ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' (2009).\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Sonic3 Hydrocity.png|thumb|240px|left|Sonic and Tails exploring the underwater portion of Hydrocity, the second zone]]\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]]. Players can control Sonic, Tails, or both. In the latter choice, players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him; a second player can join at any time and control Tails separately.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\" /> ''Sonic 3'' adds the ability for Tails to fly for a short time by spinning his twin tails like helicopter rotor;<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\" /> when he tires, he falls.

Levels are populated with Robotnik's robots, called \"badniks\"; Sonic and Tails can defeat badniks by jumping on them or using the \"spin dash\" attack, which also gives the character a speed boost.<ref name=\"m89\" /> The levels include obstacles and other features such as [[vertical loop]]s, corkscrews, breakable walls, spikes, water that the player can drown in, and bottomless pits.<ref name=\"game\">{{cite video game|title=Sonic the Hedgehog 3|developer=Sonic Team|publisher=Sega|date=February 2, 1994}}</ref> There is a [[miniboss]] fight with one of Robotnik's large, powerful robots at the end of the first act of each level and a full [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight with Robotnik at the end of the second.<ref name=\"m45\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> Reaching a new level [[Autosave|saves]] the game to one of six save slots.<ref name=\"m10\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 10.</ref>\n\nAs with previous ''Sonic'' games, ''Sonic 3'' uses [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]], scattered throughout the levels, as a health system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a [[health (gaming)|life]] and return to the most recently passed [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoint]]. Dying with zero lives gives the player a [[game over]]. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an [[1-up|extra life]], temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings,<ref name=\"m1213\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 12\u201313.</ref> a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.<ref name=\"palgn\" />\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | alt1 =\n | alt2 =\n | footer_align = left\n | image1 = Sonic 3 Special Stage.png\n | width1 = 240\n | caption1 = Tails in one of the special stages, in which the player can earn [[Chaos Emeralds]]\n | image2 = S3 special stage mechanics.svg\n | width2 = 240\n | caption2 = A diagram of how rings are generated by walking the perimeter of a group of blue spheres\n}}\n\n''Sonic 3'' contains two types of \"special stages\".

Both sides of the corridor are lined with flippers, which disappear when the character bounces on them, and the switch drops when both flippers supporting it are removed. The corridor's floor contains a bounce pad, which also disappears after one use; falling afterwards causes the player to leave the stage with the most recent power-up collected.<ref name=\"m1415\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nThe second type, triggered by entering giant rings found in secret passages, involves running around a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] map and passing through all of a number of blue spheres arranged in patterns. Passing through a blue sphere turns it red, and touching a red sphere causes the player to leave the stage, unless the player has just completed a cycle around an arrangement of blue spheres, in which case all of these spheres turn to harmless rings. Removing all of the blue spheres gives the player a [[Chaos Emerald]]; if Sonic (not Tails) collects all seven, he can become [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Common features|Super Sonic]] at will, which makes him invincible to most obstacles.<ref name=\"palgn\" /><ref name=\"super\">{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Jahanzeb|title=20 Years Ago: Sonic 3 & Knuckles|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/04/11/20-years-ago-sonic-knuckles/80530/|publisher=Hardcore Gamer|accessdate=January 4, 2015|date=April 2014}}</ref> Failing to collect the seven Chaos Emeralds triggers a [[post-credits scene]] in which Robotnik and Knuckles taunt the player.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Sonic the Hedgehog 3|developer=Sonic Team|publisher=Sega|platform=Genesis/Mega Drive|scene=Ending sequence|date=1994}}</ref>\n\n''Sonic 3'' includes a competitive mode: two players, controlling Sonic, Tails, or [[Knuckles the Echidna]], race through one or all of five stages that do not appear in the main game.

It holds a score of 89 percent at review aggregator [[GameRankings]] based on five reviews.<ref name=\"gr_s3\"/> Critics generally felt ''Sonic 3'' was the best game in the series so far. Andrew Humphreys of ''[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]'', who declared himself not a ''Sonic'' fan, said it was \"undoubtedly\" the best of the series, including the acclaimed but obscure ''Sonic CD'', though he admitted having preferred ''Sonic 2''{{'s}} special stages by a small margin.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine|Sega Magazine]]'', however, stated that ''Sonic 3'' has better special stages and was not only superior to ''Sonic 2'' as a whole but would be \"a serious contender for the Best Platform Game Ever award\".<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''[[Sega Power]]'' wrote that despite their skepticism, they found it \"excellent\" and easily \"the most explorable and playable\" in the series.<ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' also compared ''Sonic 3'' favorably to ''Sonic 1'', ''2'', and ''CD'' and awarded it their \"Game of the Month\" award.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/> They later ranked it number 1 in The EGM Hot 50, indicating that it received the highest average score of any game they had reviewed in the past year.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The EGM Hot 50 |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=69 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=April 1995 |pages=44\u201348}}</ref> Lucas M. Thomas of IGN stated that ''Sonic 3'' \"completed the trilogy as the best of them all\".<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/> Dan Whitehead of ''[[Eurogamer]],'' however, considered ''Sonic & Knuckles'' superior.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Lionel Vilner of ''[[:fr:Gen4|G\u00e9n\u00e9ration 4]]'' believed ''Sonic 3'' offered more challenge than its predecessors.<ref name=\"G4Rev\"/> The Unknown Gamer of ''[[GamePro]]'' proclaimed that it \"proves that you can teach an old hedgehog new and exciting tricks. Take that old ''Sonic'' magic, add fun new variations, and you have another spectacular game.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nSome critics felt that ''Sonic 3'' had innovated too little from previous ''Sonic'' games. Humphreys of ''Hyper'' saw only \"a few new features\"<ref name=\"hyper\"/> while ''Sega Power'' thought it was \"not all that different\"<ref name=\"power\"/> and Nintendo Life writer Damien McFerran said that \"there's not a lot of new elements here to be brutally frank\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/> While Deniz Ahmet of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' agreed that the game was \"more of the same\", he was placated by the new and imaginative ideas.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> Frank Provo of ''[[GameSpot]]'' stated that the most significant addition was its save system.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> However, he and ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' also both enjoyed the new power-ups.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> Many aspects of the level design were praised; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' and ''Sega Power'' enjoyed the expansive stages, secret areas, much less linear level design, and difficulty.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Mean Machines]]'' agreed, describing the game as \"a rollercoaster ride from start to finish\" and listing Carnival Night as their favorite level, which they described as \"probably the most slickly programmed portion of game in Megadrive history\".<ref name=\"mean\"/> Humphreys and ''Mean Machines'' felt that the game was too short, but they and ''Sega Magazine'' felt that its two-player mode and the Emerald collecting would significantly extend the [[replay value]].<ref name=\"hyper\"/><ref name=\"mean\"/><ref name=\"sm\"/> On the other hand, Whitehead said that the large stages would keep players sufficiently engrossed.<ref name=\"euro\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' also enjoyed having the ability to play as Knuckles in the two-player mode.<ref name=\"sm\"/> The Unknown Gamer felt that while the two-player mode was less fun than the main game, it was much improved over that of its predecessor due to the change of format from split-screen to full-screen.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nThe visuals were very well received. Humphreys described ''Sonic 3'' as \"one of the most beautiful games around\" and full of \"flashy new visual tricks\", highlighting Sonic's ascension up pipes and spiraling pathways as particularly inventive.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' exclaimed that its graphics were \"brilliant\" even for a ''Sonic'' game,<ref name=\"sm\"/> while Provo praised the \"elaborate\" backgrounds.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> ''Mean Machines'' thought similarly, giving special praise to the camera's quick scrolling, the diversity of the level themes, and the \"chunkier, more detailed\" overall aesthetic.<ref name=\"mean\"/> Rik Skews of ''Computer and Video Games'' stated that \"the graphics were stunning, attention to detail is breathtaking\". Ahmet of the same publication also noted that the graphics were more detailed than those of previous installments.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> The Unknown Gamer described the settings as having \"gorgeous background detail and lots of visual treats\" and was impressed by the new obstacles that Sonic can traverse at top speeds.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas and Provo especially enjoyed the use of wordless cutscenes to create a coherent story and thematically connect the zones.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> McFerran, however, felt that the visuals had been downgraded, particularly Sonic's \"dumpier\" sprite and \"the infamous 'dotty' textures\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/>\n\nThe sound effects and music were also well received, though somewhat less so than the visuals. ''Sega Magazine'' described them as \"brilliant\" and \"far superior\" to ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''Mean Machines'' stated that every level had \"great tunes\" and sound effects and particularly praised the ending music.<ref name=\"mean\"/> However, Humphreys described the sound as \"Sonicky ... with the emphasis on the 'icky'\"; he also found it strikingly similar to the first two ''Sonic'' games' soundtracks.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> The Unknown Gamer also saw musical similarity to previous installments, and described the individual tracks as \"catchy... until you've heard it a hundred times.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas thought the music was \"impressive\", but not quite on par with ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/>\n\nReviews of ports have been slightly less positive; the Xbox 360 release has scores of 78% and 79% at GameRankings and [[Metacritic]], respectively.<ref name=\"mc x360\"/> Some critics, such as Adam Ghiggino of [[PALGN]], felt ''Sonic 3'' had been insufficiently upgraded for re-releases;<ref name=\"palgn\"/> Whitehead of ''Eurogamer'' wished online co-op had been implemented.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Provo of GameSpot and Thomas of IGN wished Sega had re-released ''Sonic 3'' and ''Sonic & Knuckles'' together as ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' instead.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/>\n\n''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' ranked it the fifth best Genesis game ever in November 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Mega |issue=26 |page=74 |publisher=[[Maverick Magazines]] |date=November 1994}}</ref> In 2014, [[GamesRadar]] ranked ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' as the seventh best Genesis game;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/best-sega-genesis-games-all-time/ |publisher=GamesRadar |title=Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time |author=GamesRadar Staff |date=August 14, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> in 2013, Jeremy Parish of ''[[Eurogamer|US Gamer]]'' ranked it eighth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-best-genesis-and-sega-cd-games |website=[[Eurogamer]] |title=The 10 Best Genesis/Mega Drive and Top 5 Sega CD Games |last=Parish |first=Jeremy |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Sonic 3'' was the first appearance of [[Knuckles the Echidna]], who would be featured prominently in future ''Sonic'' games.

Gray]], 1869</small>\n}}\n\nThe '''yellow-faced honeyeater''' (''Caligavis chrysops'') is a small to medium-sized bird in the [[honeyeater]] [[family (biology)|family]], Meliphagidae. It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}} The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like ''chick-up, chick-up'', from which its common name of quitchup is derived.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}} Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long ''preet'' with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be [[contact call]]s, are animated two-note calls variously described as ''terric, terric'', ''cr-rook, cr-rook'' or ''put-put, put-put''.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Yellow-faced Honeyeater callistemon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Honeyeater balancing on a bottlebrush flower|The yellow-faced honeyeater can be seen feeding on garden shrubs.]]\n\n===Habitat===\nAcross its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a variety of habitats\u2014in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in [[Riparian zone|riparian]] woodlands. It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (''[[Corymbia maculata]]'') with [[ironbark]]s and [[stringybark]]s, such as narrow-leaved ironbark (''[[Eucalyptus crebra]]'') and silver-leaved ironbark ([[Eucalyptus melanophloia|''E. melanophloia'']]), with a light, shrubby [[understorey]], and less often in dry, open forests and [[woodland]]s dominated by ''[[Angophora]]'', ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Banksia]]'', ''[[Casuarina]]'' or ''[[Callitris]]'', or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (''[[Eucalyptus delegatensis]]'') and woodlands dominated by snow gum (''[[Eucalyptus pauciflora|E. pauciflora]]'') or white box (''[[Eucalyptus albens|E. albens]]''). It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and in developed areas including orchards, parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after [[Bushfires in Australia|fire]] or [[logging]], though it is more common in mature forests.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=725}} Where it is found in woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an [[understory]] of sclerophyll plants.<ref name=\"Ford and Paton 76\">{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Hugh A.|last2=Paton|first2=David C.|title=Resource partitioning and competition in honeyeaters of the genus ''Meliphaga''|journal=Australian Journal of Ecology|date=1976|volume=1|issue=4|pages=281\u2013287|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1976.tb01118.x}}</ref>\n\n===Range===\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc generally along the coastline from near [[Cooktown]] in [[Far North Queensland]], southwest between a line from [[Charters Towers]] to [[Albury]] and the coast, and then west to the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]] and Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. Population densities have been recorded from 0.01 birds per hectare (2.5 acres) near [[Armidale]] in New South Wales to 7.8 birds per hectare at [[Tarnagulla, Victoria]].

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied.

The Majors won the [[Memorial Cup]] in [[1934 Memorial Cup|1934]], [[1945 Memorial Cup|1945]], [[1947 Memorial Cup|1947]] and [[1961 Memorial Cup|1961]].\n\nThe Majors were the first OHL franchise based out of [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] in eight years, as their previous franchise, the [[Toronto Marlboros]], relocated to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] following the [[1988-89 OHL season|1988-89]] season.\n\n==Rebranding==\n===Detroit Whalers to Plymouth Whalers===\nThe [[Detroit Whalers]] rebranded their team as the [[Plymouth Whalers]] during the summer of 1997. The Whalers franchise moved to the [[Compuware Sports Arena]] in [[1996-97 OHL season|1996-97]], which is located in [[Plymouth, Michigan|Plymouth]]. The team would retain their current team name and uniforms.\n\n==Realignment==\nThe newest [[Ontario Hockey League]] club, the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]], joined the East Division. Due to the Majors joining the East, the OHL moved the [[North Bay Centennials]] from the East Division to the Central Division, while the [[Erie Otters]] moved from the Central Division to the West Division. This created three six-team divisions in the 18 team league.\n\n==Regular Season==\n===Final standings===\n''Note: DIV = Division; GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; OTL = Overtime Losses; GF = Goals For; GA = Goals Against; PTS = Points; x = clinched playoff berth; y = clinched division title; z = earned first round bye''\n\n=== East Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Ottawa 67's]] || 66 || 40 || 17 || 9 || '''89''' || 286 || 172\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Belleville Bulls]] || 66 || 41 || 22 || 3 || '''85''' || 315 || 239\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Kingston Frontenacs]] || 66 || 35 || 27 || 4 || '''74''' || 330 || 275\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Oshawa Generals]] || 66 || 26 || 32 || 8 || '''60''' || 214 || 247\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[Peterborough Petes]] || 66 || 20 || 36 || 10 || '''50''' || 212 || 273\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] || 66 || 15 || 42 || 9 || '''39''' || 154 || 265\n|}\n\n=== Central Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Guelph Storm]] || 66 || 42 || 18 || 6 || '''90''' || 263 || 189\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Barrie Colts]] || 66 || 38 || 23 || 5 || '''81''' || 236 || 215\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Kitchener Rangers]] || 66 || 27 || 29 || 10 || '''64''' || 224 || 239\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Owen Sound Platers]] || 66 || 27 || 34 || 5 || '''59''' || 270 || 312\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[Sudbury Wolves]] || 66 || 25 || 34 || 7 || '''57''' || 257 || 268\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| [[North Bay Centennials]] || 66 || 15 || 45 || 6 || '''36''' || 213 || 291\n|}\n\n=== West Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| y-[[London Knights]] || 66 || 40 || 21 || 5 || '''85''' || 301 || 238\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Plymouth Whalers]] || 66 || 37 || 22 || 7 || '''81''' || 279 || 223\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Sarnia Sting]] || 66 || 32 || 21 || 13 || '''77''' || 253 || 227\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Erie Otters]] || 66 || 33 || 28 || 5 || '''71''' || 261 || 252\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| [[Sault Ste.

The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] name was reactivated when they are awarded a franchise, to play in the east division. The [[Detroit Whalers]] became the [[Plymouth Whalers]]. Eighteen teams each played 66 games. The [[Guelph Storm]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[Ottawa 67's]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Toronto St. Michael's Majors===\nOn August 15, 1996, the [[Ontario Hockey League]] announced that the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] would join the league as an expansion team, beginning in the 1997-98 season. The Majors would play their home games at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], in which they shared the arena with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. The Majors would join the East Division.\n\nPreviously, the Toronto St. Michael's Majors were a junior hockey franchise from 1906-1962, as they ceased operations at the conclusion of the 1961-62 season. The Majors won the [[Memorial Cup]] in [[1934 Memorial Cup|1934]], [[1945 Memorial Cup|1945]], [[1947 Memorial Cup|1947]] and [[1961 Memorial Cup|1961]].\n\nThe Majors were the first OHL franchise based out of [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] in eight years, as their previous franchise, the [[Toronto Marlboros]], relocated to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] following the [[1988-89 OHL season|1988-89]] season.\n\n==Rebranding==\n===Detroit Whalers to Plymouth Whalers===\nThe [[Detroit Whalers]] rebranded their team as the [[Plymouth Whalers]] during the summer of 1997. The Whalers franchise moved to the [[Compuware Sports Arena]] in [[1996-97 OHL season|1996-97]], which is located in [[Plymouth, Michigan|Plymouth]]. The team would retain their current team name and uniforms.\n\n==Realignment==\nThe newest [[Ontario Hockey League]] club, the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]], joined the East Division.

Kingdom|House of Commons]].{{#tag:ref|A [[county constituency]] (for the purposes of election expenses and type of returning officer)|group= n}}{{#tag:ref|As with all constituencies, the constituency elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election at least every five years.|group= n}}\n\n==History==\n===Creation===\nThe seat was created in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] as part of the reconfiguration of those in the county to avoid [[malapportionment]], abolishing [[Oxford (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford]] as a seat. It merged about half the city with the east of the former [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Abingdon]] seat.\n\n===MPs===\nThe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[John Patten, Baron Patten|John Patten]] (MP for Oxford in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]]\u201383 Parliament), held the seat from its creation until he retired in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]]. The seat was gained by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]], [[Evan Harris|Dr Evan Harris]], who held the seat for thirteen years until the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], when the Conservative [[Nicola Blackwood]] retook the seat in one of the most [[marginal seat|marginal]] results of that election. Blackwood held the seat until the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] when she was defeated by Liberal Democrat [[Layla Moran]] in another marginal result.\n\n===Contests===\nThe seat has been contested nine times, each of them general elections. At each contest the Labour party candidate has polled third&mdash;the peak share of votes to date being 20.2%, in 1997. The strongest victory, in share of the vote, was that of Dr Harris of the Liberal Democrats in 2001, a 17.8% majority (in a seven-way contest).\n\nThe Green or predecessor Ecology Party stood in the first eight contests, in each losing the [[deposit (politics)|deposit]] paid.\n\n==Economic profile==\nThe constituency includes the town of [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], the village of [[Kidlington]], and the western and northern parts of the city of [[Oxford]], as well as a minority of the [[colleges of the University of Oxford]] \u2013 the constituency covering the rest of the city being [[Oxford East]].

Although the proposals were immediately laid before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] they were not brought forward by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] for approval. Accordingly, they will '''not''' come into effect for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]] due to take place on 12 December 2019, which will be contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nThe Commission proposed to extend the constituency both northwards, adding the [[Cherwell District|District of Cherwell]] ward of [[Kirtlington]] from [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]], and southwards, adding the [[Vale of White Horse|Vale of White Horse District]] wards of [[Drayton, Vale of White Horse|Drayton]] and [[Marcham]] from [[Wantage (UK Parliament constituency)|Wantage]].

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond.

The report concluded that the crash was caused by a [[Buk missile system|Buk 9M38-series surface-to-air missile]] with a 9N314M [[warhead]]. The warhead detonated outside and above the left-hand side of the cockpit. The impact killed the three people in the cockpit and caused structural damage to the airplane leading to an in-flight break-up resulting in a wreckage area of 50 square kilometres and loss of the lives of all 298 occupants.<ref name=\"DSB_Final_Report\"/> Based on evidence they were able to exclude meteor strikes, the airplane having technical defects, a bomb, and an air-to-air attack as causes of the crash.
