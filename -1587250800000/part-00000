Directed by [[Martin Campbell]] and written by [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]], and [[Paul Haggis]], it is the first film to star [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], and was produced by Eon Productions for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], making it the first Eon-produced ''Bond'' film to be [[International co-production|co-produced]] by the latter studio.

The plot has Bond on an assignment to bankrupt [[terrorist financing|terrorist financier]] [[Le Chiffre]] in a high-stakes [[poker]] game at the Casino Royale in [[Montenegro]]; Bond falls in love with femme fatale [[Vesper Lynd]], a treasury employee assigned to provide the money he needs for the game. The film begins a [[story arc]] that continues in the 2008 film, ''[[Quantum of Solace]]''.\n\nCasting involved a widespread search for a new actor to succeed [[Pierce Brosnan]] as James Bond; the choice of Craig, announced in October 2005, drew controversy. [[Location shooting|Location filming]] took place in the [[Czech Republic]], [[the Bahamas]], [[Italy]], and the [[United Kingdom]] with interior sets built at [[Barrandov Studios]] and [[Pinewood Studios]].\n\n''Casino Royale'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 14 November 2006. It received an overwhelmingly positive critical response, with reviewers highlighting Craig's reinvention of the character and the film's departure from the tropes of previous Bond films.<ref>{{Citation|title=Casino Royale|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/casino_royale/|language=en|accessdate=2017-11-21}}</ref> It earned ${{Format price|606000000}} worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film until the release of ''[[Skyfall]]'' in 2012.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent James Bond gains his status as a [[00 agent]] by assassinating traitorous section chief Dryden and his contact.\n\nIn [[Uganda]], the mysterious [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] introduces Steven Obanno, a high-ranking member of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]], to [[Le Chiffre]], a [[private bank]]er to terrorists. Obanno entrusts Le Chiffre with a large sum of money to invest; Le Chiffre subsequently buys [[put option]]s on [[aerospace manufacturer]] Skyfleet, betting on the company's failure given his insider knowledge of a terrorist attack.\n\nIn [[Madagascar]], Bond pursues bomb-maker Mollaka to an [[embassy]], killing him and blowing up the building. In [[London]], MI6 chief [[M (James Bond)|M]] admonishes Bond for ignoring [[diplomatic immunity|international law]] and her orders to capture Mollaka alive. Clues point to corrupt [[Greece|Greek]] official [[Alex Dimitrios]], whom Bond finds in the [[Bahamas]]. After winning his 1964 [[Aston Martin DB5]] in a poker game and seducing his wife Solange, Bond pursues Dimitrios to [[Miami]], where he kills him. Following his henchman Carlos to the airport, Bond thwarts the destruction of [[Skyfleet S570|Skyfleet's airliner]] and Le Chiffre loses Obanno's money.\n\nTo recoup the money, Le Chiffre organizes a high-stakes [[Texas hold 'em]] tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the [[British government]] in exchange for information on his clients. Bond is paired with [[Vesper Lynd]], a [[HM Treasury|British Treasury]] agent protecting the $10&nbsp;million [[buying in (poker)|buy-in]]. In Montenegro, they meet their contact, [[Ren\u00e9 Mathis]].\n\nBond initially gains the upper hand, deducing Le Chiffre's [[Tell (poker)|tell]]. Obanno ambushes Le Chiffre and his girlfriend Valenka with a [[machete]], but allows him to continue playing to win back the money. Obanno's bodyguard spots Bond and Vesper, but Bond kills Obanno. After comforting a traumatised Vesper, Bond loses his [[poker staking|stake]] when Le Chiffre is tipped off to his own tell, and Vesper refuses to authorize the $5 million to buy back in. Preparing to kill Le Chiffre, Bond meets fellow player [[Felix Leiter]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent, who agrees to stake Bond in exchange for taking Le Chiffre into American custody. \n\nBond rebuilds his position until Valenka poisons his [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]] with [[digitalis]]. Retrieving an [[antidote]] and [[defibrillation|defibrillator]] from his [[Aston Martin DBS V12]], Bond passes out until Vesper rescues him. Bond returns to the game, which culminates in a $115 million hand in which the remaining players go [[All in (poker)|all in]]. Le Chiffre trumps the others, but Bond wins with a [[straight flush]].\n\nApparently tipped off by Mathis, Le Chiffre kidnaps Vesper. In pursuit, Bond crashes his car to avoid Vesper, tied up in the road. Le Chiffre brings the captive Bond and Vesper to an abandoned ship and tortures Bond to reveal the account number and password to the winnings, but Bond refuses. Le Chiffre prepares to castrate Bond, but Mr. White barges in and kills Le Chiffre, leaving Bond and Vesper alive.\n\nBond awakens in an MI6 hospital and has Mathis arrested as the traitor. After transferring the winnings, Bond goes away with Vesper, with whom he has fallen in love. He resigns from MI6 and they run away to [[Venice]], but when M reveals the money was never deposited, Bond realises Vesper has betrayed him. He follows her to a handoff of the money, where gunmen take her captive. Bond shoots the building's flotation devices, causing the foundation to sink into the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]]. He kills the gunmen but Vesper, imprisoned in an elevator, locks herself inside as the lift plunges into the rising water. Bond is unable to free Vesper before she drowns and his efforts to [[Resuscitation|resuscitate]] her fail. Mr. White escapes with the money.\n\nM informs Bond that the organisation behind Le Chiffre had threatened to kill Vesper's lover unless she became a [[double agent]]; she likely made a deal, trading the money for Bond's life. Bond coldly renounces Vesper as a traitor and tells M he will return to service.

It's the best way to go\".<ref name=\"Real\"/> Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the [[Miami Airport]] chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]] and in Pinewood Studios.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\nThe first scenes shot were ones involving a Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel with which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted  in 1977 during the filming of ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.<ref name=\"Real\"/> In the scene, Bond drives a [[Excavator|digger]] towards the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\nThe sequence at Miami International Airport was partly shot at the [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]], in Surrey, which is known from British car show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports.<ref name=\"Real\"/> In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden, and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards at the moment of full extension away from the plane.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\nThe Skyfleet S570 aircraft in the film was an ex-[[British Airways]] 747-200B [[G-BDXJ]], which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film. The modified aircraft had the outboard engines replaced by external fuel tanks, while the inboard engines were replaced by a mock-up pair of engines on each inboard pylon. The cockpit profile was altered to make the 747 look like a prototype of an advanced airliner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0297.shtml |title=Boeing 747 in Casino Royale}}</ref> The plane used can be seen on the BBC motoring programme ''Top Gear'' on the [[Top Gear Test Track|Test Track]].\n\nThe sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film,<ref name=\"Real\"/> with tank consisting of a Venetian [[piazza]] and the interior of an abandoned house being constructed. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated electronics with hydraulic valves that were closely controlled by computer because of the dynamic movement within the system on its two axes. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model, which the effects team had built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model elevator within the rig could be immersed in {{convert|19|ft|m}} of water, and used banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n[[File:Aston Martin DBS (Casino Royale) front-left-2 National Motor Museum, Beaulieu.jpg|thumbnail|right|Aston Martin DBS driven by Bond in the film]]\nAt the time of filming, [[Aston Martin]] was still in the final phases of designing the [[Aston Martin DBS|DBS]]. Aston Martin delivered two working \u2018hero\u2019 cars to the film. In addition to the two \u2018hero\u2019 cars, Aston Martin had to prepare, and reinforce to withstand impact, three former development DB9's for use as DBS look-a-like stunt cars for the scene involving the car crash. Also a white prototype DB9 manual was supplied to the film crew so that the stunt drivers had something to practice with.<ref>https://astonmartins.com/car/dbs-v12-for-007/</ref> Owing to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450&nbsp;mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at [[Millbrook Proving Ground]]s and Adam Kirley, the stunt driver who performed the stunt, had to use an [[air blaster|air cannon]] located behind the driver's seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a speed exceeding <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">70&nbsp;mph&nbsp;(113&nbsp;km/h)</span>, the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' on 5 November 2006 as a new [[world record]].<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Casino Royale (2006 soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack of ''Casino Royale'', released by [[Sony Classical Records]] on 14 November 2006, featured music composed by veteran composer [[David Arnold]], his fourth soundtrack for the ''Bond'' film series, while Nicholas Dodd orchestrated and conducted the [[Film score|score]].

The plot has Bond on an assignment to bankrupt [[terrorist financing|terrorist financier]] [[Le Chiffre]] in a high-stakes [[poker]] game at the Casino Royale in [[Montenegro]]; Bond falls in love with femme fatale [[Vesper Lynd]], a treasury employee assigned to provide the money he needs for the game. The film begins a [[story arc]] that continues in the 2008 film, ''[[Quantum of Solace]]''.\n\nCasting involved a widespread search for a new actor to succeed [[Pierce Brosnan]] as James Bond; the choice of Craig, announced in October 2005, drew controversy. [[Location shooting|Location filming]] took place in the [[Czech Republic]], [[the Bahamas]], [[Italy]], and the [[United Kingdom]] with interior sets built at [[Barrandov Studios]] and [[Pinewood Studios]].\n\n''Casino Royale'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 14 November 2006. It received an overwhelmingly positive critical response, with reviewers highlighting Craig's reinvention of the character and the film's departure from the tropes of previous Bond films.<ref>{{Citation|title=Casino Royale|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/casino_royale/|language=en|accessdate=2017-11-21}}</ref> It earned ${{Format price|606000000}} worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film until the release of ''[[Skyfall]]'' in 2012.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent James Bond gains his status as a [[00 agent]] by assassinating traitorous section chief Dryden and his contact.\n\nIn [[Uganda]], the mysterious [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] introduces Steven Obanno, a high-ranking member of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]], to [[Le Chiffre]], a [[private bank]]er to terrorists. Obanno entrusts Le Chiffre with a large sum of money to invest; Le Chiffre subsequently buys [[put option]]s on [[aerospace manufacturer]] Skyfleet, betting on the company's failure given his insider knowledge of a terrorist attack.\n\nIn [[Madagascar]], Bond pursues bomb-maker Mollaka to an [[embassy]], killing him and blowing up the building. In [[London]], MI6 chief [[M (James Bond)|M]] admonishes Bond for ignoring [[diplomatic immunity|international law]] and her orders to capture Mollaka alive. Clues point to corrupt [[Greece|Greek]] official [[Alex Dimitrios]], whom Bond finds in the [[Bahamas]]. After winning his 1964 [[Aston Martin DB5]] in a poker game and seducing his wife Solange, Bond pursues Dimitrios to [[Miami]], where he kills him. Following his henchman Carlos to the airport, Bond thwarts the destruction of [[Skyfleet S570|Skyfleet's airliner]] and Le Chiffre loses Obanno's money.\n\nTo recoup the money, Le Chiffre organizes a high-stakes [[Texas hold 'em]] tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the [[British government]] in exchange for information on his clients. Bond is paired with [[Vesper Lynd]], a [[HM Treasury|British Treasury]] agent protecting the $10&nbsp;million [[buying in (poker)|buy-in]]. In Montenegro, they meet their contact, [[Ren\u00e9 Mathis]].\n\nBond initially gains the upper hand, deducing Le Chiffre's [[Tell (poker)|tell]]. Obanno ambushes Le Chiffre and his girlfriend Valenka with a [[machete]], but allows him to continue playing to win back the money. Obanno's bodyguard spots Bond and Vesper, but Bond kills Obanno. After comforting a traumatised Vesper, Bond loses his [[poker staking|stake]] when Le Chiffre is tipped off to his own tell, and Vesper refuses to authorize the $5 million to buy back in. Preparing to kill Le Chiffre, Bond meets fellow player [[Felix Leiter]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent, who agrees to stake Bond in exchange for taking Le Chiffre into American custody. \n\nBond rebuilds his position until Valenka poisons his [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]] with [[digitalis]]. Retrieving an [[antidote]] and [[defibrillation|defibrillator]] from his [[Aston Martin DBS V12]], Bond passes out until Vesper rescues him. Bond returns to the game, which culminates in a $115 million hand in which the remaining players go [[All in (poker)|all in]]. Le Chiffre trumps the others, but Bond wins with a [[straight flush]].\n\nApparently tipped off by Mathis, Le Chiffre kidnaps Vesper. In pursuit, Bond crashes his car to avoid Vesper, tied up in the road. Le Chiffre brings the captive Bond and Vesper to an abandoned ship and tortures Bond to reveal the account number and password to the winnings, but Bond refuses. Le Chiffre prepares to castrate Bond, but Mr. White barges in and kills Le Chiffre, leaving Bond and Vesper alive.\n\nBond awakens in an MI6 hospital and has Mathis arrested as the traitor. After transferring the winnings, Bond goes away with Vesper, with whom he has fallen in love. He resigns from MI6 and they run away to [[Venice]], but when M reveals the money was never deposited, Bond realises Vesper has betrayed him. He follows her to a handoff of the money, where gunmen take her captive. Bond shoots the building's flotation devices, causing the foundation to sink into the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]]. He kills the gunmen but Vesper, imprisoned in an elevator, locks herself inside as the lift plunges into the rising water. Bond is unable to free Vesper before she drowns and his efforts to [[Resuscitation|resuscitate]] her fail. Mr. White escapes with the money.\n\nM informs Bond that the organisation behind Le Chiffre had threatened to kill Vesper's lover unless she became a [[double agent]]; she likely made a deal, trading the money for Bond's life. Bond coldly renounces Vesper as a traitor and tells M he will return to service. At an estate in [[Lake Como]], Bond locates Mr. White, shooting him in the leg and introducing himself: \"The name's Bond. James Bond.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]: A British MI6 officer who, after being assigned 00 status, is sent on a mission to arrest a bomb-maker in [[Madagascar]], where he stumbles upon Le Chiffre's terrorist cell and is then sent to defeat him in a high-stakes poker game at Casino Royale.\n* [[Eva Green]] as [[Vesper Lynd]]: An agent for Her Majesty's Treasury assigned to supervise Bond and finance him in a high-stakes poker game.\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as [[Le Chiffre]]: A banker who services many of the world's terrorists, he is a mathematical genius and expert chess player, and uses these skills when playing poker.\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[M (James Bond)|M]]: The head of MI6, although she feels she has promoted Bond too soon and chides him for his rash actions, she acts as an important maternal figure in his life.

According to Corbould, \"CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It's the best way to go\".<ref name=\"Real\"/> Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the [[Miami Airport]] chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]] and in Pinewood Studios.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\nThe first scenes shot were ones involving a Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel with which Michael G.

A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\nThe sequence at Miami International Airport was partly shot at the [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]], in Surrey, which is known from British car show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports.<ref name=\"Real\"/> In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden, and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards at the moment of full extension away from the plane.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\nThe Skyfleet S570 aircraft in the film was an ex-[[British Airways]] 747-200B [[G-BDXJ]], which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film.
