The severe-weather event produced at least 32 [[tornado]]es, at least nine\u2014and possibly 10 or more\u2014of which were [[Fujita scale#Rating classifications|violent]] tornadoes, all of which rated F4 on the Fujita scale. Powerful tornado activity was distributed from the [[Great Plains]] to [[South Carolina]]. The first day of the outbreak occurred on April 20 and produced numerous strong to violent tornadoes across parts of North Texas, [[Oklahoma]], and [[Kansas]]. A second day of intense tornadoes occurred on April 21, with several strong to violent tornadoes across [[Illinois]] and [[Indiana]]. The final day, April 22, produced an F4 tornado in Georgia as well. The entire outbreak killed 56 people, and was followed days later by another intense [[1912 Oklahoma tornado outbreak|tornado outbreak]] on April 27. That outbreak killed about 40 people, mostly in Oklahoma. Both outbreaks produced a combined total of nine F4 tornadoes in Oklahoma alone.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Tornado table==\n{{Tornado Chart Pre-1950|Total = \u2265 32|F? = 1|F0 = ?|F1 = 1|F2 = 12|F3 = 9|F4 = 9|F5 = 0|Enhanced=no}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Confirmed tornadoes==\n\n===April 20===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ List of confirmed tornadoes \u2013 April 20, 1912{{#tag:ref|All dates are based on the local [[time zone]] where the tornado touched down; however, all times are in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] for consistency.||group=\"nb\"|name=\"Date/Time\"}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"3%\" align=\"center\"|[[Fujita scale|F#]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"7%\" align=\"center\" class=\"unsortable\"|Location\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"6%\" align=\"center\" class=\"unsortable\"|County / Parish\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\" align=\"center\"|State\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"6%\" align=\"center\"|Time ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]])\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"6%\" align=\"center\"|Path length\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"6%\" align=\"center\"|Max width\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"48%\" class=\"unsortable\" align=\"center\"|Summary\n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{storm colour|cat1}} align=\"center\" | F1\n|[[Taylor, Texas|Taylor]] area\n|[[Williamson County, Texas|Williamson]]\n|[[Texas|TX]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|'''1 death''' \u2013 A tornado destroyed frail structures, killing a man and injuring his wife.<ref name=Grazulis1>Grazulis, ''Significant Tornadoes'', 731</ref>\n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{storm colour|cat3}} align=\"center\" | F3\n|[[Alvord, Texas|Alvord]] to S of [[Rosston, Texas|Rosston]]\n|[[Wise County, Texas|Wise]], [[Cooke County, Texas|Cooke]]\n|[[Texas|TX]]\n|2100\n|{{convert|22|mi|km|sortable=on}}\n|{{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|The first of four strong tornadoes to hit [[North Texas]] on April 20 destroyed nine homes and a church as it passed through Alvord.

The entire outbreak killed 56 people, and was followed days later by another intense [[1912 Oklahoma tornado outbreak|tornado outbreak]] on April 27. That outbreak killed about 40 people, mostly in Oklahoma. Both outbreaks produced a combined total of nine F4 tornadoes in Oklahoma alone.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Tornado table==\n{{Tornado Chart Pre-1950|Total = \u2265 32|F? = 1|F0 = ?|F1 = 1|F2 = 12|F3 = 9|F4 = 9|F5 = 0|Enhanced=no}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Confirmed tornadoes==\n\n===April 20===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ List of confirmed tornadoes \u2013 April 20, 1912{{#tag:ref|All dates are based on the local [[time zone]] where the tornado touched down; however, all times are in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] for consistency.||group=\"nb\"|name=\"Date/Time\"}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"3%\" align=\"center\"|[[Fujita scale|F#]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"7%\" align=\"center\" class=\"unsortable\"|Location\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"6%\" align=\"center\" class=\"unsortable\"|County / Parish\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\" align=\"center\"|State\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"6%\" align=\"center\"|Time ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]])\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"6%\" align=\"center\"|Path length\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"6%\" align=\"center\"|Max width\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"48%\" class=\"unsortable\" align=\"center\"|Summary\n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{storm colour|cat1}} align=\"center\" | F1\n|[[Taylor, Texas|Taylor]] area\n|[[Williamson County, Texas|Williamson]]\n|[[Texas|TX]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|'''1 death''' \u2013 A tornado destroyed frail structures, killing a man and injuring his wife.<ref name=Grazulis1>Grazulis, ''Significant Tornadoes'', 731</ref>\n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{storm colour|cat3}} align=\"center\" | F3\n|[[Alvord, Texas|Alvord]] to S of [[Rosston, Texas|Rosston]]\n|[[Wise County, Texas|Wise]], [[Cooke County, Texas|Cooke]]\n|[[Texas|TX]]\n|2100\n|{{convert|22|mi|km|sortable=on}}\n|{{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|The first of four strong tornadoes to hit [[North Texas]] on April 20 destroyed nine homes and a church as it passed through Alvord.

The story concerns a violent clash of cultures and ideals between the [[counter-culture]] and traditional [[conservative]] values, with the film's squealing antagonist [[Leatherface]] carrying a chainsaw and wearing the faces of victims he and his family eat. ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'' spawned imitators and its false \"based on a true story\" advertisements gave way to reenactments of [[true crime]].

''Sleepaway Camp'' featured [[homosexual]] scenes, which were [[taboo]] at the time.{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pages=132\u201344}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thenewbev.com/blog/2017/02/the-sexual-politics-of-sleepaway-camp/|title=The Sexual Politics of Sleepaway Camp {{!}} New Beverly Cinema|last=Influence|first=Urban|website=New Beverly Cinema - The premier revival theater in Los Angeles|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}</ref>\n\nIn Canada, [[whodunit]] ''[[Curtains (1983 film)|Curtains]]'' had a brief theatrical life before finding new life on VHS, while criticism toward ''[[American Nightmare (film)|American Nightmare]]'''s portrayal of [[prostitutes]], [[drug addicts]], and [[Pornography addiction|pornography addicts]] hurt its video rentals.{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pages=132\u201344}} ''[[Sledgehammer (film)|Sledgehammer]] was'' shot-on-video for just $40,000, with a gender-reversal climax showing ''[[Playgirl]]'' model [[Ted Prior (actor)|Ted Prior]] as a \"final guy.\"<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> Other home video slashers from the year include ''[[Blood Beat (1983)|Blood Beat]],'' ''[[Double Exposure (1983)|Double Exposure]]'', and ''[[Scalps]]'', the latter claiming to be one of the most censored films in history.{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pages=132\u201344}} Releases began to distance from the genre. The poster for ''[[Mortuary (1983 American film)|Mortuary]]'' features a hand is bursting from the grave, though the undead have nothing to do with the film. Distributors were aware of fading box office profits, and they were attempting to hoodwink audiences into thinking long-shelved releases like ''Mortuary'' were different.\n\n===1984===\nThe public had largely lost interest in theatrical released slashers, drawing a close to the Golden Age.<ref name=\"Harper04\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Production rates plummeted and major studios all but abandoned the genre that, only a few years earlier, had been very profitable. Many 1984 slasher films with brief theatrical runs found varying degrees of success on home video, such as ''[[Splatter University]]'', ''[[Satan's Blade]]'', ''[[Blood Theatre]]'', ''[[Rocktober Blood]]'' and ''[[Fatal Games]]''. Movies like ''[[The Prey (1984 film)|The Prey]]'' and ''[[Evil Judgement (1984)|Evil Judgement]]'' were filmed years prior and finally were given small theatrical releases. ''[[Silent Madness]]'' used [[3D film|3D]] to ride the success of ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' (1982), though the effect did not translate to the [[VHS]] format.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'' brought the saga of [[Jason Voorhees]] to a close, with his demise the main marketing tool. It worked, with ''The Final Chapter'' selling 10-million tickets in North America, hinting the series would continue even if Jason's demise marked a shift in the genre.<ref name=\":10\" /> This shift was emphasized by [[controversy]] from ''[[Silent Night, Deadly Night]]'' (1984): Protesters picketed theaters playing the film with placards reading, \"Deck the hall with holly \u2013 not bodies!\" Despite other Christmas-themed horror films, including the same year's ''[[Don't Open till Christmas]]'', promotional material for ''Silent Night, Deadly Night'' featured a killer Santa with the tagline: \"He knows when you've been naughty!\" Released in November 1984 by [[TriStar Pictures]], persistent [[Caroling|carol]]-singers forced one [[Bronx, New York|Bronx]] cinema to pull ''Silent Night, Deadly Night'' a week into its run. Soon widespread outrage led to the film's removal, with only 741,500 tickets sold.{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pages=142\u201352}}<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nAs interest in the Golden Age slasher waned, [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' revitalized the genre by mixing fantasy and the supernatural in a cost-effective way. Craven had toyed with slasher films before in ''Deadly Blessing'' (1981), though he was frustrated that the genre he had helped create with ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (1977) had not benefited him financially. Developing ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' since 1981, Craven recognized time running out due to declining revenues from theatrical slasher film releases.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tribecafilm.com/stories/wes-craven-obituary-tribute-last-house-on-left-nightmare-on-elm-street-scream|title=Master Class: How Wes Craven Reinvented the Horror Genre Three Decades in a Row {{!}} Tribeca|work=Tribeca|access-date=2018-05-14}}</ref> ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' and especially its villain [[Freddy Krueger]] ([[Robert Englund]]) became cultural phenomenons.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/lists/making-of-nightmare-on-elm-street-10-best-scenes-20141030|title=Behind the 10 Most Shocking 'Nightmare on Elm Street' Scenes|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-05-14|date=2014-10-30}}</ref> On a budget of just $1.8 million, the film was a commercial success, grossing more than $25.5 million in North America and launched one of the most successful film series in history.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' provided the success that [[New Line Cinema]] needed to become major [[Hollywood]] company.

The [[home video]] revolution, fueled by the popularity of [[VHS]], provided a new outlet for [[low-budget film]]making. Without [[major studios|major studio]] backing for theatrical release, slasher films became second only to [[pornography]] in the home video market. The drop in budgets to accommodate a more economic approach was usually met with a decline in quality. Holdovers filmed during the Golden Age such as ''[[Too Scared to Scream]]'' (1985), ''[[The Mutilator]]'' (1985), ''[[Blood Rage]]'' (1987) ''[[Killer Party]]'' (1986) and ''[[Mountaintop Motel Massacre]]'' (1986) found video distribution. Mirroring the [[punk rock]] movement, novice filmmakers proved anyone could make a movie on home video, resulting in shot-on-video slashers ''[[Blood Cult]]'' (1985), ''[[The Ripper (1985)|The Ripper]]'' (1985), ''[[Spine (film)|Spine]]'' (1986), ''[[Truth or Dare? (film)|Truth or Dare?]]'' (1986), ''[[Killer Workout]]'' (1987), and ''[[Death Spa]]'' (1989).{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pages=156\u20137}} Lesser-known horror properties ''[[Sleepaway Camp (film series)|Sleepaway Camp]]'', ''[[Massacre (film series)|The Slumber Party Massacre]]'' and ''[[Silent Night, Deadly Night (franchise)|Silent Night, Deadly Night]]'' became series on home video. ''[[The Hills Have Eyes Part 2]]'' (1985) and ''[[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning]]'' (1985) were theatrically released but neither film was embraced like ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge]]'' (1985), a sequel rushed into production. Distinguished by overtly [[homoerotic]] undertones, ''Freddy's Revenge'' became the highest grossing horror film of 1985 and inspired  \"dream\" slashes ''[[Dreamaniac (1986)|Dreamaniac]]'' (1986), ''[[Bad Dreams (film)|Bad Dreams]]'' (1988), ''[[Deadly Dreams]]'' (1988), and ''[[Dream Demon]]'' (1988).\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] released the [[parody]] ''[[April Fool's Day (1986 film)|April Fool's Day]]'' (1986) with hopes to start a sister series to its ''Friday the 13th'' property, though the film's modest box office run never led to a series. Three other [[Parody science|spoofs]], ''[[Evil Laugh]]'' (1986), ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]'' (1986) and ''[[Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives]]'' (1986), were box office disappointments; ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2'' sold just 2 million tickets while ''Jason Lives'' sold 5.2 million, both significantly down from their predecessors.{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pages=158\u20139}} Trying to cater the public of adult action thrillers that were popular in the 1980s, [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s cop-thriller ''[[Cobra (1986 film)|Cobra]]'' (1986) is a thinly-veiled slasher film advertised as an action movie, and sold 13.2 million tickets. The home video market made stars out of [[character actor]]s such as [[Terry O'Quinn]] and [[Bruce Campbell]], whose respective independent horror-thrillers ''[[The Stepfather (1987 film)|The Stepfather]]'' (1987) and ''[[Maniac Cop]]'' (1988) found more support on home video than in theaters. Quinn returned for ''[[Stepfather II]]'' (1989) but chose not to reprise his role in \"[[Stepfather III]]\" (1992), while Campbell followed a similar route with a cameo in ''[[Maniac Cop 2]]'' (1990) and no participation in ''[[Maniac Cop III: Badge of Silence]]'' (1993).\n\nThe ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' series dominated late-1980s horror wave, with ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'' (1987) selling 11.5 million tickets in North America, and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]'' (1988) following another 12 million tickets. By comparison, ''[[Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood]]'' (1988) and ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'' (1988) sold approximately 4.5 million tickets each, less than half of the ''Elm Street'' films. The personality-driven appeal of [[Freddy Krueger]] was not lost on filmmakers, as characters like [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] and Candyman were given ample dialogue and placed in urban settings that had largely been ignored by the Golden Age. Chucky's ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'' (1988) and [[Child's Play 2|its 1990 sequel]] sold over 14.7 million tickets combined, while ''[[Candyman (1992 film)|Candyman]]'' (1992) sold a healthy 6.2 million. Both series fell out rather quickly, when ''[[Child's Play 3]]'' (1991) selling only 3.5 million tickets in North America and ''[[Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh]]'' (1995) selling only 3.2 million.{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pages=159\u201361}}\n\nInternationally, the slasher film remained profitable. Mexico released ''[[Zombie Apocalypse]]'' (1985), ''[[Don't Panic (1988 film)|Don't Panic]]'' (1988), ''[[Grave Robbers (1990 film)|Grave Robbers]]'' (1990) and ''[[Hell's Trap (1990)|Hell's Trap]]'' (1990). Europe saw releases from Sweden's ''[[Blood Tracks (1985)|Blood Tracks]]'' (1985), The United Kingdom's ''[[Lucifer (1987 film)|Lucifer]]'' (1987), Spain's ''[[Anguish (1987 film)|Anguish]]'' (1987) and Italy's ''[[Stage Fright (1987 film)|StageFright]]'' (1987) and ''[[Body Count (1987 film)|BodyCount]]'' (1987). In the Pacific, Australia released ''[[Symphony of Evil (1987)|Symphony of Evil]]'' (1987), ''[[Houseboat Horror]]'' (1989), and ''[[Bloodmoon (1990 film)|Bloodmoon]]'' (1990), while Japan released ''[[Evil Dead Trap]]'' (1988).{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pages=166\u20138}}\n\nBy 1989 the major series had faded from public interest, resulting in box office failures from ''[[Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan]]'' (1989), ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]'' (1989) and ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'' (1989).{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|p=161}} ''The Dream Child''<nowiki/>'s 5.6 million tickets were a sharp decline, while ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' and ''The Revenge of Michael Myers'' each sold only about 3 million tickets. Due to the declining ticket sales, rights to the ''Friday the 13th'' and ''Halloween'' series were sold to [[New Line Cinema]] and [[Miramax|Miramax Films]], respectively. Now owning both the [[Jason Voorhees]] and [[Freddy Krueger]] characters, New Line would look into a series-crossover event film. ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' (1991) and ''[[Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday]]'' (1993) began this crossover series, but profit losses from both films stalled the project for a decade. ''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]'' (1995) was released under Miramax's [[Dimension Films]] banner, to negative fan reaction, and a weak box office.{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|p=165}}\n\n==Post-modern slashers (1996\u2013present)==\n[[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare|New Nightmare]]'' (1994) utilized characters from [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|his original ''Elm Street'' film]] in self-referential and ironic ways, as the actors played versions of their true personas targeted by a Freddy Krueger-inspired demon. ''New Nightmare'' sold 2.3 million tickets the North American box office. The slasher film's surprising resurrection came in the form of ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996), a box office smash and redefined the genre's rules. Directed by Craven and written by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]], ''Scream'' juggled postmodern humor with visceral horror. The film played on [[nostalgia]] for the Golden Age, but appealed to a younger audience with contemporary young actors and popular music. Williamson, a self-confessed fan of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[Prom Night (1980 film)|Prom Night]]'' (1980), and ''[[Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives]]'' (1986), wrote the characters as well-versed in horror film lore and knowing all the [[clich\u00e9]]s that the audience were aware of. The film grossed $173 million worldwide, it became both the highest grossing slasher film of all time and the first one to cross $100 million at the domestic box office, and the most successful horror film since ''The Silence of the Lambs'' (1991). The marketing for ''Scream'' distanced itself from the slasher subgenre as it passed itself as a \"new thriller\" that showcased the [[celebrity]] of its stars, promoting the appearances of then-popular stars [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Courteney Cox]] and [[Neve Campbell]] over its violence.\n\nWilliamson's follow-up, ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1997), was heavily inspired by ''Prom Night'' and ''[[The House on Sorority Row]]'' (1983). Released less than a year after ''Scream'' to \"critic proof\" success, the film sold nearly 16 million tickets at the North American box office. Two months later [[Dimension Films]] released ''[[Scream 2]]'' (1997) to the highest grossing opening weekend of any R-rated film at the time; the sequel sold 22 million tickets and was a critical hit. Taking note from the marketing success of ''Scream'', the promotional materials for ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' and ''Scream 2'' relied heavily on the recognizability of cast-members [[Rebecca Gayheart]], [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]], [[Joshua Jackson]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], [[Jerry O'Connell]], [[Ryan Phillippe]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]], [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] and [[Liev Schreiber]].\n\n''Scream'' and ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' were internationally popular. In Asia, [[Hong Kong]] released ''[[The Deadly Camp]]'' (1999) and South Korea released ''[[Bloody Beach]]'' (2000), ''The Record'' (2001), and ''[[Nightmare (2000 film)|Nightmare]]'' (2000). Australia's postmodern ''[[Cut (2000 film)|Cut]]'' (2000) cast American actress [[Molly Ringwald]] as its heroine. Britain released ''[[Lighthouse (film)|Lighthouse]]'' (1999) and the Netherlands had two teen slashers, ''[[School's Out (1999 film)|School's Out]]'' (1999) and ''[[Swimming Pool (2001 film)|The Pool]]'' (2001). [[Bollywood]] produced the first [[Musical film|musical]]-slasher hybrid with ''[[Kucch To Hai]]'' (2003), as well as the more straightforward ''[[Dhund: The Fog]]'' (2003).\n\n''Scream 2'' marked a high-point for interest in the 1990s slasher film. ''[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]'' (1998) was a modest hit, selling 8 million tickets, though slasher sales were already starting to drop. The sequels ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998), ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' (1998) and ''[[I Still Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1998) were each box office successes, again marketing on the appeal their casts, which included [[Adam Arkin]], [[Jack Black]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Brandy Norwood]], [[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe|Jodi Lynn O'Keefe]], [[Mekhi Phifer]], [[John Ritter]], [[Jennifer Tilly]], and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]]. Low-budget slasher films ''[[The Clown at Midnight]]'' (1998) and ''[[Cherry Falls]]'' (2000) had trouble competing with big-budget horror films that could afford then-bankable actors.\n\n''[[Scream 3]]'' (2000), the first entry in the [[Scream (series)|''Scream'' series]] not written by Kevin Williamson, was another huge success with 16.5 million tickets sold, though poor [[Word-of-mouth marketing|word-of-mouth]] prevented it from reaching the heights of its predecessors. ''[[Urban Legends: Final Cut]]'' (2000) sold a meager 4 million tickets, less than half of what its predecessor had sold just two years earlier. Both the ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer (film series)|I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' and ''Urban Legend'' sequels were relegated to the [[direct-to-video]] market. The genre continued to fall apart with [[box office bomb]]s ''[[Valentine (film)|Valentine]]'' (2001) and ''[[Jason X]]'' (2002), as well as the critically maligned ''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]'' (2002), a sequel that sold less than half its predecessor's tickets. [[New Line Cinema]]'s highly anticipated ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' (2003), in development since 1986, took note from ''Scream'', and mixed nostalgia with recognizable actors. It sold a massive 14 million tickets at the domestic box office, acting as a symbolic love-letter to slasher films of the Golden Age.\n\nFilms like ''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'' (2000) and ''[[Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)|Jeepers Creepers]]'' (2001) kept slasher film values in mainstream movies, but they deviated from the standard formula set forth by movies such as ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984) and ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996). The filmmakers behind ''[[Make a Wish (2002 film)|Make a Wish]]'' (2002) and ''[[Hellbent (2004 film)|HellBent]]'' (2004) diversified their stories to appeal to their [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] audiences. African American filmmakers with largely black casts took stabs at the genre in ''[[Killjoy (2000 film)|Killjoy]]'' (2000), ''[[Holla If I Kill You]]'' (2003), ''[[Holla (2006)|Holla]]'' (2006), and ''[[Somebody Help Me (film)|Somebody Help Me]]'' (2007).\n\nWith 2.5 million tickets sold on a low-budget, ''[[Wrong Turn]]'' (2003) launched a [[Wrong Turn (film series)|series of straight-to-video sequels]]. Filmmakers around the world tested the levels of on-screen violence an audience would accept. Musician-filmmaker [[Rob Zombie]] strove to bring the horror genre away from pop-culture and back to its [[Exploitation film|exploitative]] roots in ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'' (2003) and ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'' (2005). [[New French Extremity]] violence was influential in ''[[High Tension]]'' (2003), ''[[Them (2006 film)|Them]]'' (2006), ''[[Inside (2007 film)|Inside]]'' (2007), ''[[Frontier(s)]]'' (2007) and ''[[Martyrs (2008 film)|Martyrs]]'' (2008) became worldwide hits. Other European slasher films of the time included Austria's ''[[Dead in 3 Days]]'' (2006), Norway's ''[[Cold Prey]]'' (2006) and [[Cold Prey 2|its 2008 sequel]], as well as a number of British thrillers: ''[[Long Time Dead]]'' (2002), ''[[Creep (2004 film)|Creep]]'' (2004), ''[[Severance (film)|Severance]]'' (2006), ''[[Wilderness (2006 film)|Wilderness]]'' (2008), ''[[The Children (2008 film)|The Children]]'' (2008), ''[[Eden Lake]]'' (2008) and ''[[Tormented (2009 British film)|Tormented]]'' (2009). In Asia, [[Taiwan]] released ''[[Invitation Only (film)|Invitation Only]]'' (2009), ''[[Scared (2005 film)|Scared]]'' (2005), and ''[[Slice (2009 film)|Slice]]'' (2009), while [[South Korea]]'s released ''[[Bloody Reunion]]'' (2006),\n\nLow-budget North American slasher films received limited theatrical releases before the [[DVD]] releases (which had replaced the obsolete [[VHS]] format). ''[[Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon]]'' (2006), ''[[All the Boys Love Mandy Lane]]'' (2006), ''[[Dark Ride (film)|Dark Ride]]'' (2006), ''[[Hatchet (film)|Hatchet]]'' (2006), ''[[Simon Says (film)|Simon Says]]'' (2006), ''[[The Tripper]]'' (2006), ''[[See No Evil (2006 film)|See No Evil]]'' (2006), and ''[[Gutterballs (film)|Gutterballs]]'' (2008) each reference early 80s slasher films, though they were sidelined to limited distribution in a market crowded by [[splatter film]]s in the wake of ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' (2004) and [[Saw (franchise)|its sequels]]. [[Wes Craven]], one of the biggest names in horror for over three decades, directed box office disappointments ''[[My Soul to Take]]'' (2011) and ''[[Scream 4]]'' (2011), which sold only 1.8 million and 4.7 million tickets, respectively. ''[[The Strangers (2008 film)|The Strangers]]'' (2008) and ''[[You're Next]]'' (2011) were applauded for their craftsmanship and post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] twist on the [[List of films featuring home invasions|home invasion]] genre, though neither film generated much interest beyond horror fans. 80s homages ''[[Tucker & Dale vs. Evil]]'' (2010) and ''[[The Final Girls]]'' (2015) add thematic and emotional subtexts (i.e. [[Stereotype|stereotyping]] and [[grief]]), bringing praise for effectively mixing horror with heart.<ref>{{Citation|title=Tucker and Dale vs. Evil|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tucker_and_dale_vs_evil|language=en|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=The Final Girls|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_final_girls/|language=en|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> [[Meta]]-horror [[Sleeper hit|sleeper-hit]] ''[[The Cabin in the Woods]]'' (2012) was a financial and critical success that shook preconceived notions, and twisted them unexpected ways that marked a conscious-turning point for the whole horror genre, not just slasher films: audiences wanted surprising and original thrillers that were not strict throwbacks. These small but noticeable changes would come to affect the genre in the coming decade.\n\n=== Remakes and reboots ===\nAs 1990s ''Scream''-inspired slasher films dwindled in popularity, the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003) became a [[sleeper hit]] by playing on public's familiarity of [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|the 1974 original]] but promising updated thrills and suspense. Like [[Gus Van Sant]]'s ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' dilute the original film's controversial aspects for maximum commercial appeal. ''The'' ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' remake sold over 13.5 million tickets in North America and was followed by ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning]]'' (2006), which sold a respectable 6-million tickets, though it was still struck by diminishing returns.\n\nRiding on the success of the [[21st century|21st Century]]'s ''Chainsaw Massacre'' remake was ''[[House of Wax (2005 film)|House of Wax]]'' (2005), ''[[Black Christmas (2006 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (2006), ''[[April Fool's Day (2008 film)|April Fool's Day]]'' (2008), ''[[Train (film)|Train]]'' (2008). Remakes of ''[[The Fog (2005 film)|The Fog]]'' (2005), ''[[When a Stranger Calls (2006 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'' (2006) and ''[[Prom Night (2008 film)|Prom Night]]'' (2008) were watered down, and released with PG-13 ratings to pull in the largest teenage audience possible, though only ''Prom Night'' sold more tickets than its original counterpart. [[Rob Zombie]]'s ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'' (2007) took the simplicity of [[Halloween (1978 film)|the original 1978 film]] but added an extreme vision that, according to critics, replaced everything that made the first film a success. Despite these criticisms, Zombie's ''Halloween'' sold nearly 8.5 million tickets, but its negative reception hurt its violent sequel ''[[Halloween II (2009 film)|Halloween II]]'' (2009), which could not sell 4.5 million tickets just two years after its predecessor. Extreme violence in the ''Halloween'' or ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' remakes hit its peak with ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (2006) and its less-well received sequel, ''[[The Hills Have Eyes 2]]'' (2007).\n\nThe remake-era peaked in 2009 under releases of ''[[My Bloody Valentine 3D|My Bloody Valentine]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', [[The Last House on the Left (2009 film)|''The Last House on the Left'']], ''[[Sorority Row]]'', ''[[The Stepfather (2009 film)|The Stepfather]]'' and ''Halloween II''. Of those, ''Friday the 13th'' was most successful selling 8.7 million tickets and ''Sorority Row'' was least successful with under 1.6 million tickets sold. The following year ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (2010), like the ''Friday the 13th'' remake, had a large opening weekend but quickly fell off the box office charts after.

''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' (2013), a sequel (with elements of a reboot) of the [[Child's Play (franchise)|''Child's Play'' series]] and the first entry not released in theaters, was well-received and given [[Cult of Chucky|a sequel of its own]] in 2017. The reboot ''[[Texas Chainsaw 3D]]'' (2013) acts as a sequel to the [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|1974 original film]], but lackluster box office profits led to its prequel ''[[Leatherface (2017 film)|Leatherface]]'' (2017) to a direct-to-download release (''Leatherface'' was filmed in 2015 but shelved for two years).\n\n===Recent works===\nA decline in theatrical profits encouraged film producers to creatively translate the horror film genre to a television audience. The success of [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]'s ''[[American Horror Story]]'' and [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' [[Green-light|green-lit]] a number of networks to develop horror series, several structured or based on slasher films. [[A&E Networks|A&E]]'s ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'' and former [[MTV]] and now, [[VH1]]'s ''[[Scream (TV series)|Scream]]''  offered creative deaths and cathartic suspense, while [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]'s ''[[Pretty Little Liars (TV series)|Pretty Little Liars]]'' and [[The CW]]'s ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]'' took more restrained approaches to the [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] demographic. [[Netflix]]'s ''[[Slasher (TV series)|Slasher]]'' and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[Scream Queens (2015 TV series)|Scream Queens]]'' are/were intended to be [[Anthology|anthologies]] with new settings and mysteries every season.

[[The Purge|Three sequels]] and a [[The Purge (TV series)|television series]] followed ''The Purge'', while ''[[Happy Death Day 2U]]'' found modest success in February 2019.

[[Paul Lynch (director)|Paul Lynch]]'s ''[[Humongous (1982 film)|Humongous]]'' was released through [[AVCO Embassy Pictures]], but a change in management severely limited the film's theatrical release.

''[[Alone in the Dark (1982 film)|Alone in the Dark]]'' was [[New Line Cinema]]'s first feature film, released to little revenue and initially dismissed by critics, though the film has gained critical reappraisal.

[[Universal Pictures]] had a tiny release for ''[[Death Valley (1982 film)|Death Valley]]'', while [[Columbia Pictures]] found modest success with ''[[Silent Rage]]''. Independent distributor [[Embassy Pictures]] released ''[[The Seduction (film)|The Seduction]]'' to a surprising $11 million, an erotic slasher-thriller that predates [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'' (1987) and ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992) by several years.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nInternationally, Australia released ''[[Next of Kin (1982 film)|Next of Kin]]'' while Puerto Rico's ''[[Pieces (film)|Pieces]]'' was filmed in [[Boston]] and [[Madrid]] by an Italian-American producer with a Spanish director.

''[[The House on Sorority Row]]'' followed the same general plot as ''Prom Night'' (1980) with guilty teens stalked and punished for a terrible secret. ''[[The Final Terror]]'' borrows visual and thematic elements from ''Just Before Dawn'' (1981), as ''[[Sweet Sixteen (1983 film)|Sweet Sixteen]]'' borrows from ''Happy Birthday to Me'' (1981). The most successful slasher of the year was ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', which grossed over $34 million at the box office.

The poster for ''[[Mortuary (1983 American film)|Mortuary]]'' features a hand is bursting from the grave, though the undead have nothing to do with the film. Distributors were aware of fading box office profits, and they were attempting to hoodwink audiences into thinking long-shelved releases like ''Mortuary'' were different.\n\n===1984===\nThe public had largely lost interest in theatrical released slashers, drawing a close to the Golden Age.<ref name=\"Harper04\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Production rates plummeted and major studios all but abandoned the genre that, only a few years earlier, had been very profitable. Many 1984 slasher films with brief theatrical runs found varying degrees of success on home video, such as ''[[Splatter University]]'', ''[[Satan's Blade]]'', ''[[Blood Theatre]]'', ''[[Rocktober Blood]]'' and ''[[Fatal Games]]''. Movies like ''[[The Prey (1984 film)|The Prey]]'' and ''[[Evil Judgement (1984)|Evil Judgement]]'' were filmed years prior and finally were given small theatrical releases. ''[[Silent Madness]]'' used [[3D film|3D]] to ride the success of ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' (1982), though the effect did not translate to the [[VHS]] format.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'' brought the saga of [[Jason Voorhees]] to a close, with his demise the main marketing tool. It worked, with ''The Final Chapter'' selling 10-million tickets in North America, hinting the series would continue even if Jason's demise marked a shift in the genre.<ref name=\":10\" /> This shift was emphasized by [[controversy]] from ''[[Silent Night, Deadly Night]]'' (1984): Protesters picketed theaters playing the film with placards reading, \"Deck the hall with holly \u2013 not bodies!\" Despite other Christmas-themed horror films, including the same year's ''[[Don't Open till Christmas]]'', promotional material for ''Silent Night, Deadly Night'' featured a killer Santa with the tagline: \"He knows when you've been naughty!\" Released in November 1984 by [[TriStar Pictures]], persistent [[Caroling|carol]]-singers forced one [[Bronx, New York|Bronx]] cinema to pull ''Silent Night, Deadly Night'' a week into its run. Soon widespread outrage led to the film's removal, with only 741,500 tickets sold.{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pages=142\u201352}}<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nAs interest in the Golden Age slasher waned, [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' revitalized the genre by mixing fantasy and the supernatural in a cost-effective way. Craven had toyed with slasher films before in ''Deadly Blessing'' (1981), though he was frustrated that the genre he had helped create with ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (1977) had not benefited him financially.

The [[home video]] revolution, fueled by the popularity of [[VHS]], provided a new outlet for [[low-budget film]]making. Without [[major studios|major studio]] backing for theatrical release, slasher films became second only to [[pornography]] in the home video market. The drop in budgets to accommodate a more economic approach was usually met with a decline in quality. Holdovers filmed during the Golden Age such as ''[[Too Scared to Scream]]'' (1985), ''[[The Mutilator]]'' (1985), ''[[Blood Rage]]'' (1987) ''[[Killer Party]]'' (1986) and ''[[Mountaintop Motel Massacre]]'' (1986) found video distribution. Mirroring the [[punk rock]] movement, novice filmmakers proved anyone could make a movie on home video, resulting in shot-on-video slashers ''[[Blood Cult]]'' (1985), ''[[The Ripper (1985)|The Ripper]]'' (1985), ''[[Spine (film)|Spine]]'' (1986), ''[[Truth or Dare? (film)|Truth or Dare?]]'' (1986), ''[[Killer Workout]]'' (1987), and ''[[Death Spa]]'' (1989).{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pages=156\u20137}} Lesser-known horror properties ''[[Sleepaway Camp (film series)|Sleepaway Camp]]'', ''[[Massacre (film series)|The Slumber Party Massacre]]'' and ''[[Silent Night, Deadly Night (franchise)|Silent Night, Deadly Night]]'' became series on home video. ''[[The Hills Have Eyes Part 2]]'' (1985) and ''[[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning]]'' (1985) were theatrically released but neither film was embraced like ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge]]'' (1985), a sequel rushed into production. Distinguished by overtly [[homoerotic]] undertones, ''Freddy's Revenge'' became the highest grossing horror film of 1985 and inspired  \"dream\" slashes ''[[Dreamaniac (1986)|Dreamaniac]]'' (1986), ''[[Bad Dreams (film)|Bad Dreams]]'' (1988), ''[[Deadly Dreams]]'' (1988), and ''[[Dream Demon]]'' (1988).\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] released the [[parody]] ''[[April Fool's Day (1986 film)|April Fool's Day]]'' (1986) with hopes to start a sister series to its ''Friday the 13th'' property, though the film's modest box office run never led to a series. Three other [[Parody science|spoofs]], ''[[Evil Laugh]]'' (1986), ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]'' (1986) and ''[[Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives]]'' (1986), were box office disappointments; ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2'' sold just 2 million tickets while ''Jason Lives'' sold 5.2 million, both significantly down from their predecessors.{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pages=158\u20139}} Trying to cater the public of adult action thrillers that were popular in the 1980s, [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s cop-thriller ''[[Cobra (1986 film)|Cobra]]'' (1986) is a thinly-veiled slasher film advertised as an action movie, and sold 13.2 million tickets. The home video market made stars out of [[character actor]]s such as [[Terry O'Quinn]] and [[Bruce Campbell]], whose respective independent horror-thrillers ''[[The Stepfather (1987 film)|The Stepfather]]'' (1987) and ''[[Maniac Cop]]'' (1988) found more support on home video than in theaters. Quinn returned for ''[[Stepfather II]]'' (1989) but chose not to reprise his role in \"[[Stepfather III]]\" (1992), while Campbell followed a similar route with a cameo in ''[[Maniac Cop 2]]'' (1990) and no participation in ''[[Maniac Cop III: Badge of Silence]]'' (1993).\n\nThe ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' series dominated late-1980s horror wave, with ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'' (1987) selling 11.5 million tickets in North America, and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]'' (1988) following another 12 million tickets. By comparison, ''[[Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood]]'' (1988) and ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'' (1988) sold approximately 4.5 million tickets each, less than half of the ''Elm Street'' films. The personality-driven appeal of [[Freddy Krueger]] was not lost on filmmakers, as characters like [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] and Candyman were given ample dialogue and placed in urban settings that had largely been ignored by the Golden Age. Chucky's ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'' (1988) and [[Child's Play 2|its 1990 sequel]] sold over 14.7 million tickets combined, while ''[[Candyman (1992 film)|Candyman]]'' (1992) sold a healthy 6.2 million. Both series fell out rather quickly, when ''[[Child's Play 3]]'' (1991) selling only 3.5 million tickets in North America and ''[[Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh]]'' (1995) selling only 3.2 million.{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pages=159\u201361}}\n\nInternationally, the slasher film remained profitable. Mexico released ''[[Zombie Apocalypse]]'' (1985), ''[[Don't Panic (1988 film)|Don't Panic]]'' (1988), ''[[Grave Robbers (1990 film)|Grave Robbers]]'' (1990) and ''[[Hell's Trap (1990)|Hell's Trap]]'' (1990). Europe saw releases from Sweden's ''[[Blood Tracks (1985)|Blood Tracks]]'' (1985), The United Kingdom's ''[[Lucifer (1987 film)|Lucifer]]'' (1987), Spain's ''[[Anguish (1987 film)|Anguish]]'' (1987) and Italy's ''[[Stage Fright (1987 film)|StageFright]]'' (1987) and ''[[Body Count (1987 film)|BodyCount]]'' (1987). In the Pacific, Australia released ''[[Symphony of Evil (1987)|Symphony of Evil]]'' (1987), ''[[Houseboat Horror]]'' (1989), and ''[[Bloodmoon (1990 film)|Bloodmoon]]'' (1990), while Japan released ''[[Evil Dead Trap]]'' (1988).{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pages=166\u20138}}\n\nBy 1989 the major series had faded from public interest, resulting in box office failures from ''[[Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan]]'' (1989), ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]'' (1989) and ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'' (1989).{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|p=161}} ''The Dream Child''<nowiki/>'s 5.6 million tickets were a sharp decline, while ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' and ''The Revenge of Michael Myers'' each sold only about 3 million tickets. Due to the declining ticket sales, rights to the ''Friday the 13th'' and ''Halloween'' series were sold to [[New Line Cinema]] and [[Miramax|Miramax Films]], respectively. Now owning both the [[Jason Voorhees]] and [[Freddy Krueger]] characters, New Line would look into a series-crossover event film. ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' (1991) and ''[[Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday]]'' (1993) began this crossover series, but profit losses from both films stalled the project for a decade. ''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]'' (1995) was released under Miramax's [[Dimension Films]] banner, to negative fan reaction, and a weak box office.{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|p=165}}\n\n==Post-modern slashers (1996\u2013present)==\n[[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare|New Nightmare]]'' (1994) utilized characters from [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|his original ''Elm Street'' film]] in self-referential and ironic ways, as the actors played versions of their true personas targeted by a Freddy Krueger-inspired demon. ''New Nightmare'' sold 2.3 million tickets the North American box office. The slasher film's surprising resurrection came in the form of ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996), a box office smash and redefined the genre's rules. Directed by Craven and written by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]], ''Scream'' juggled postmodern humor with visceral horror. The film played on [[nostalgia]] for the Golden Age, but appealed to a younger audience with contemporary young actors and popular music. Williamson, a self-confessed fan of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[Prom Night (1980 film)|Prom Night]]'' (1980), and ''[[Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives]]'' (1986), wrote the characters as well-versed in horror film lore and knowing all the [[clich\u00e9]]s that the audience were aware of. The film grossed $173 million worldwide, it became both the highest grossing slasher film of all time and the first one to cross $100 million at the domestic box office, and the most successful horror film since ''The Silence of the Lambs'' (1991). The marketing for ''Scream'' distanced itself from the slasher subgenre as it passed itself as a \"new thriller\" that showcased the [[celebrity]] of its stars, promoting the appearances of then-popular stars [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Courteney Cox]] and [[Neve Campbell]] over its violence.\n\nWilliamson's follow-up, ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1997), was heavily inspired by ''Prom Night'' and ''[[The House on Sorority Row]]'' (1983). Released less than a year after ''Scream'' to \"critic proof\" success, the film sold nearly 16 million tickets at the North American box office. Two months later [[Dimension Films]] released ''[[Scream 2]]'' (1997) to the highest grossing opening weekend of any R-rated film at the time; the sequel sold 22 million tickets and was a critical hit. Taking note from the marketing success of ''Scream'', the promotional materials for ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' and ''Scream 2'' relied heavily on the recognizability of cast-members [[Rebecca Gayheart]], [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]], [[Joshua Jackson]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], [[Jerry O'Connell]], [[Ryan Phillippe]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]], [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] and [[Liev Schreiber]].\n\n''Scream'' and ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' were internationally popular. In Asia, [[Hong Kong]] released ''[[The Deadly Camp]]'' (1999) and South Korea released ''[[Bloody Beach]]'' (2000), ''The Record'' (2001), and ''[[Nightmare (2000 film)|Nightmare]]'' (2000). Australia's postmodern ''[[Cut (2000 film)|Cut]]'' (2000) cast American actress [[Molly Ringwald]] as its heroine. Britain released ''[[Lighthouse (film)|Lighthouse]]'' (1999) and the Netherlands had two teen slashers, ''[[School's Out (1999 film)|School's Out]]'' (1999) and ''[[Swimming Pool (2001 film)|The Pool]]'' (2001). [[Bollywood]] produced the first [[Musical film|musical]]-slasher hybrid with ''[[Kucch To Hai]]'' (2003), as well as the more straightforward ''[[Dhund: The Fog]]'' (2003).\n\n''Scream 2'' marked a high-point for interest in the 1990s slasher film. ''[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]'' (1998) was a modest hit, selling 8 million tickets, though slasher sales were already starting to drop. The sequels ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998), ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' (1998) and ''[[I Still Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1998) were each box office successes, again marketing on the appeal their casts, which included [[Adam Arkin]], [[Jack Black]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Brandy Norwood]], [[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe|Jodi Lynn O'Keefe]], [[Mekhi Phifer]], [[John Ritter]], [[Jennifer Tilly]], and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]]. Low-budget slasher films ''[[The Clown at Midnight]]'' (1998) and ''[[Cherry Falls]]'' (2000) had trouble competing with big-budget horror films that could afford then-bankable actors.\n\n''[[Scream 3]]'' (2000), the first entry in the [[Scream (series)|''Scream'' series]] not written by Kevin Williamson, was another huge success with 16.5 million tickets sold, though poor [[Word-of-mouth marketing|word-of-mouth]] prevented it from reaching the heights of its predecessors. ''[[Urban Legends: Final Cut]]'' (2000) sold a meager 4 million tickets, less than half of what its predecessor had sold just two years earlier. Both the ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer (film series)|I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' and ''Urban Legend'' sequels were relegated to the [[direct-to-video]] market. The genre continued to fall apart with [[box office bomb]]s ''[[Valentine (film)|Valentine]]'' (2001) and ''[[Jason X]]'' (2002), as well as the critically maligned ''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]'' (2002), a sequel that sold less than half its predecessor's tickets. [[New Line Cinema]]'s highly anticipated ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' (2003), in development since 1986, took note from ''Scream'', and mixed nostalgia with recognizable actors. It sold a massive 14 million tickets at the domestic box office, acting as a symbolic love-letter to slasher films of the Golden Age.\n\nFilms like ''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'' (2000) and ''[[Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)|Jeepers Creepers]]'' (2001) kept slasher film values in mainstream movies, but they deviated from the standard formula set forth by movies such as ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984) and ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996). The filmmakers behind ''[[Make a Wish (2002 film)|Make a Wish]]'' (2002) and ''[[Hellbent (2004 film)|HellBent]]'' (2004) diversified their stories to appeal to their [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] audiences. African American filmmakers with largely black casts took stabs at the genre in ''[[Killjoy (2000 film)|Killjoy]]'' (2000), ''[[Holla If I Kill You]]'' (2003), ''[[Holla (2006)|Holla]]'' (2006), and ''[[Somebody Help Me (film)|Somebody Help Me]]'' (2007).\n\nWith 2.5 million tickets sold on a low-budget, ''[[Wrong Turn]]'' (2003) launched a [[Wrong Turn (film series)|series of straight-to-video sequels]]. Filmmakers around the world tested the levels of on-screen violence an audience would accept. Musician-filmmaker [[Rob Zombie]] strove to bring the horror genre away from pop-culture and back to its [[Exploitation film|exploitative]] roots in ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'' (2003) and ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'' (2005). [[New French Extremity]] violence was influential in ''[[High Tension]]'' (2003), ''[[Them (2006 film)|Them]]'' (2006), ''[[Inside (2007 film)|Inside]]'' (2007), ''[[Frontier(s)]]'' (2007) and ''[[Martyrs (2008 film)|Martyrs]]'' (2008) became worldwide hits. Other European slasher films of the time included Austria's ''[[Dead in 3 Days]]'' (2006), Norway's ''[[Cold Prey]]'' (2006) and [[Cold Prey 2|its 2008 sequel]], as well as a number of British thrillers: ''[[Long Time Dead]]'' (2002), ''[[Creep (2004 film)|Creep]]'' (2004), ''[[Severance (film)|Severance]]'' (2006), ''[[Wilderness (2006 film)|Wilderness]]'' (2008), ''[[The Children (2008 film)|The Children]]'' (2008), ''[[Eden Lake]]'' (2008) and ''[[Tormented (2009 British film)|Tormented]]'' (2009). In Asia, [[Taiwan]] released ''[[Invitation Only (film)|Invitation Only]]'' (2009), ''[[Scared (2005 film)|Scared]]'' (2005), and ''[[Slice (2009 film)|Slice]]'' (2009), while [[South Korea]]'s released ''[[Bloody Reunion]]'' (2006),\n\nLow-budget North American slasher films received limited theatrical releases before the [[DVD]] releases (which had replaced the obsolete [[VHS]] format). ''[[Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon]]'' (2006), ''[[All the Boys Love Mandy Lane]]'' (2006), ''[[Dark Ride (film)|Dark Ride]]'' (2006), ''[[Hatchet (film)|Hatchet]]'' (2006), ''[[Simon Says (film)|Simon Says]]'' (2006), ''[[The Tripper]]'' (2006), ''[[See No Evil (2006 film)|See No Evil]]'' (2006), and ''[[Gutterballs (film)|Gutterballs]]'' (2008) each reference early 80s slasher films, though they were sidelined to limited distribution in a market crowded by [[splatter film]]s in the wake of ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' (2004) and [[Saw (franchise)|its sequels]]. [[Wes Craven]], one of the biggest names in horror for over three decades, directed box office disappointments ''[[My Soul to Take]]'' (2011) and ''[[Scream 4]]'' (2011), which sold only 1.8 million and 4.7 million tickets, respectively. ''[[The Strangers (2008 film)|The Strangers]]'' (2008) and ''[[You're Next]]'' (2011) were applauded for their craftsmanship and post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] twist on the [[List of films featuring home invasions|home invasion]] genre, though neither film generated much interest beyond horror fans. 80s homages ''[[Tucker & Dale vs. Evil]]'' (2010) and ''[[The Final Girls]]'' (2015) add thematic and emotional subtexts (i.e. [[Stereotype|stereotyping]] and [[grief]]), bringing praise for effectively mixing horror with heart.<ref>{{Citation|title=Tucker and Dale vs. Evil|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tucker_and_dale_vs_evil|language=en|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=The Final Girls|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_final_girls/|language=en|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> [[Meta]]-horror [[Sleeper hit|sleeper-hit]] ''[[The Cabin in the Woods]]'' (2012) was a financial and critical success that shook preconceived notions, and twisted them unexpected ways that marked a conscious-turning point for the whole horror genre, not just slasher films: audiences wanted surprising and original thrillers that were not strict throwbacks. These small but noticeable changes would come to affect the genre in the coming decade.\n\n=== Remakes and reboots ===\nAs 1990s ''Scream''-inspired slasher films dwindled in popularity, the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003) became a [[sleeper hit]] by playing on public's familiarity of [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|the 1974 original]] but promising updated thrills and suspense. Like [[Gus Van Sant]]'s ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' dilute the original film's controversial aspects for maximum commercial appeal. ''The'' ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' remake sold over 13.5 million tickets in North America and was followed by ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning]]'' (2006), which sold a respectable 6-million tickets, though it was still struck by diminishing returns.\n\nRiding on the success of the [[21st century|21st Century]]'s ''Chainsaw Massacre'' remake was ''[[House of Wax (2005 film)|House of Wax]]'' (2005), ''[[Black Christmas (2006 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (2006), ''[[April Fool's Day (2008 film)|April Fool's Day]]'' (2008), ''[[Train (film)|Train]]'' (2008). Remakes of ''[[The Fog (2005 film)|The Fog]]'' (2005), ''[[When a Stranger Calls (2006 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'' (2006) and ''[[Prom Night (2008 film)|Prom Night]]'' (2008) were watered down, and released with PG-13 ratings to pull in the largest teenage audience possible, though only ''Prom Night'' sold more tickets than its original counterpart. [[Rob Zombie]]'s ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'' (2007) took the simplicity of [[Halloween (1978 film)|the original 1978 film]] but added an extreme vision that, according to critics, replaced everything that made the first film a success. Despite these criticisms, Zombie's ''Halloween'' sold nearly 8.5 million tickets, but its negative reception hurt its violent sequel ''[[Halloween II (2009 film)|Halloween II]]'' (2009), which could not sell 4.5 million tickets just two years after its predecessor. Extreme violence in the ''Halloween'' or ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' remakes hit its peak with ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (2006) and its less-well received sequel, ''[[The Hills Have Eyes 2]]'' (2007).\n\nThe remake-era peaked in 2009 under releases of ''[[My Bloody Valentine 3D|My Bloody Valentine]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', [[The Last House on the Left (2009 film)|''The Last House on the Left'']], ''[[Sorority Row]]'', ''[[The Stepfather (2009 film)|The Stepfather]]'' and ''Halloween II''. Of those, ''Friday the 13th'' was most successful selling 8.7 million tickets and ''Sorority Row'' was least successful with under 1.6 million tickets sold. The following year ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (2010), like the ''Friday the 13th'' remake, had a large opening weekend but quickly fell off the box office charts after. Straight-to-video remakes ''[[Mother's Day (2010 film)|Mother's Day]]'' (2010), ''[[Silent Night (2012 film)|Silent Night]]'' (2012) and ''[[Silent Night, Bloody Night: The Homecoming]]'' (2013) were met with little reception or praise. ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' (2013), a sequel (with elements of a reboot) of the [[Child's Play (franchise)|''Child's Play'' series]] and the first entry not released in theaters, was well-received and given [[Cult of Chucky|a sequel of its own]] in 2017. The reboot ''[[Texas Chainsaw 3D]]'' (2013) acts as a sequel to the [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|1974 original film]], but lackluster box office profits led to its prequel ''[[Leatherface (2017 film)|Leatherface]]'' (2017) to a direct-to-download release (''Leatherface'' was filmed in 2015 but shelved for two years).\n\n===Recent works===\nA decline in theatrical profits encouraged film producers to creatively translate the horror film genre to a television audience. The success of [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]'s ''[[American Horror Story]]'' and [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' [[Green-light|green-lit]] a number of networks to develop horror series, several structured or based on slasher films. [[A&E Networks|A&E]]'s ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'' and former [[MTV]] and now, [[VH1]]'s ''[[Scream (TV series)|Scream]]''  offered creative deaths and cathartic suspense, while [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]'s ''[[Pretty Little Liars (TV series)|Pretty Little Liars]]'' and [[The CW]]'s ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]'' took more restrained approaches to the [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] demographic. [[Netflix]]'s ''[[Slasher (TV series)|Slasher]]'' and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[Scream Queens (2015 TV series)|Scream Queens]]'' are/were intended to be [[Anthology|anthologies]] with new settings and mysteries every season. A [[Television film|TV remake]] of ''[[The Bad Seed (1956 film)|The Bad Seed]]'' aired on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] in fall 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/12/rob-lowe-star-direct-the-bad-seed-remake-lifetime-gender-switch-1202217662/|title=Rob Lowe Stars In 'The Bad Seed' Remake With A Gender Switch Eyed By Lifetime|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2017-12-15|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en-US}}</ref> In June 2018 ''[[Child's Play (franchise)|Child's Play]]'' creator [[Don Mancini]] [[Twitter|Tweeted]] that he is shopping a TV series with [[Brad Dourif]] as [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]].

[[The Guest (film)|''The Guest'']] (2014) and ''[[Don't Breathe]]'' (2016) twisted conventional tropes into unexpected takes on the horror genre.\n\n[[Blumhouse Productions]], founded by [[Jason Blum]] on his successful [[Paranormal Activity (film series)|''Paranormal Activity'']]  and [[Insidious (film series)|''Insidious'' series]], released mid-budget slasher films ''[[The Purge]]'' (2013), ''[[Happy Death Day]]'' (2017) and ''[[Truth or Dare (2018 film)|Truth or Dare]]'' (2018). [[The Purge|Three sequels]] and a [[The Purge (TV series)|television series]] followed ''The Purge'', while ''[[Happy Death Day 2U]]'' found modest success in February 2019. Blumhouse released [[Metafiction|meta]]-[[sequel]]s [[The Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014 film)|''The Town That Dreaded Sundown'']] (2014) and ''[[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween]]'' (2018), which retconned their predecessors to begin a new continuity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/04/halloween-movie-jamie-lee-curtis-first-trailer-revealed-cinemacon-1202376629/|title='Halloween': Jamie Lee Curtis Unmasks First Trailer At CinemaCon|last=N'Duka|first=Amanda|date=2018-04-25|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en-US}}</ref> ''Halloween'', in particular, was a huge success for Blumhouse and [[Universal Pictures]].

{"title_page": "Gaelic broadcasting in Scotland", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n{{more footnotes|date=June 2015}}\n\n'''Gaelic broadcasting in Scotland''' is a developing area of the media in Scotland which deals with broadcasts given in [[Scottish Gaelic]] and has important links with the efforts of Gaelic revival in Scotland. As well as being informative, Gaelic broadcasting in Scotland has acquired some symbolic importance. Whilst [[opinion polls]] show that the vast majority of [[Gaels]] feel they have been ill-served by [[Scottish media|broadcasting media]],<ref name=\"bbctrust\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/consult/gaelic_digital_service/pva_research_p.pdf Summary of PVA Research] - [[BBC Online]] on behalf of the [[BBC Trust]].</ref> Scotland now has Gaelic broadcasting all over Scotland both on television and radio.\n\n==History==\n===1923\u20131945===\nThe first [[BBC]] radio broadcast in the Gaelic language was aired throughout [[Scotland]] on Sunday 2 December 1923; this was a 15-minute religious address by Rev. John Bain, recorded in the [[High kirk|High]] [[United Free Church]] in [[Aberdeen]].  Two weeks later, a recital of Gaelic singing was broadcast, though it was introduced in [[English language|English]].\n\nThe first regular programme was singer [[Neil MacLean (singer)|Neil MacLean]]'s {{lang|gd|Sgeulachdan agus Oran|italic=yes}} ('Stories and songs'), broadcast from the Aberdeen studio.  The first Gaelic radio play, entitled {{lang|gd|Dunach|italic=yes}}, was aired in 1933.  It is perhaps indicative of the status of Gaelic broadcasting at this time that the producer of {{lang|gd|Dunach|italic=yes}} knew no Gaelic.\n\nIn 1934 a series of lessons for Gaelic learners was broadcast.  In 1936, Scotland's first outside broadcast was a Gaelic service from [[Iona Abbey]].  In 1939 a weekly Gaelic news review was launched.\n\nIn 1935, Hugh MacPhee was appointed head of the BBC's first Gaelic department,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-1VRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LjQNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5559%2C2302193 |title=BBC Gaelic Assistant: {{lang|gd|An Comunn|nocat=y}} Official\u2019s Appointment |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |date=16 August 1935 |page=8 |accessdate=8 June 2016}}</ref> which moved to Glasgow in 1938; this seems to have been the first attempt to put Gaelic broadcasting on a serious footing.\n\nIn 1940, {{lang|gd|[[An Comunn G\u00e0idhealach]]|italic=no}} requested an increase of output to two news programmes and a children's programme each week.  This was refused, which resulted in questions being raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].\n\n===The post-war years===\nAfter the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Finlay J. Macdonald]] (later co-founder of {{lang|gd|[[Gairm]]|italic=yes}}) joined Hugh MacPhee in the [[Glasgow]] studios; he was replaced in 1954 by [[Fred Macaulay (Radio Producer)|Fred Macaulay]].  With two full-time producers, the regular programming was expanded to 90 minutes per week.  There was a Friday evening news slot which [[George Orwell]], writing at that time in [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], criticised for its \"amateurishness\".  A number of radio plays were produced, including {{lang|gd|An Tunnag Fhiadhaich|italic=yes}}, a translation by Lachlan MacKinnon of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''The Wild Duck'' (1951).\n\n===Television===\nBecause few areas of the [[West Highlands]] and virtually none of the [[islands of Scotland|islands]] could receive television signals before the early 1960s, Gaelic TV was not an issue at first, though there had been coverage of the {{lang|gd|[[Royal National M\u00f2d|M\u00f2d]]|italic=no}}.  As with radio, Gaelic TV broadcasting began with Gaelic songs introduced in English, such as {{lang|gd|Ce\u00f2l nan Gaidheal|italic=yes}} ('Music of the Gaels'), introduced by [[James Shaw Grant]] (1962).  The first genuine Gaelic TV programme was in the light entertainment category: {{lang|gd|[[Se Ur Beatha]]|italic=yes}} ('You're welcome') in 1964.  The first current affairs television series, {{lang|gd|Bonn Comhraidh|italic=yes}}, was launched in 1970.  Gaelic schools programmes began in 1975. The first Gaelic children's TV programme, {{lang|gd|Cuir Car|italic=yes}}, was aired in 1977, followed by ''Bzzz'' in 1981, and the first programme for pre-school children, {{lang|gd|Mag is Mog|italic=yes}}, in 1982.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vfE9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=6EgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2140%2C4976202 |title=Gaelic fun with Mag and Mag |first=Andrew |last=Young |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |date=30 January 1982 |page=9 |accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref> The pre-school \"classic\" {{lang|gd|[[D\u00f2taman]]|italic=yes}} was broadcast from 1985.\n\n===Radio Highland===\nIn 1976, BBC Radio Highland began broadcasting from [[Inverness]].

[[BBC One Scotland]] broadcast the programmes in the morning usually before  ''Children's BBC'' at 10:10{{snd}}10:30{{nbsp}}am, before moving to 9:45{{nbsp}}am in October 1986 as part of new BBC Daytime line up. Since then, the timeslots have varied for children's Gaelic programmes during the daytime hours varying from around 9am - 2pm on [[BBC One Scotland]] between 1987 - 1995, From October 1995, The new timeslots were mostly in the mid-afternoon (3pm - 3:30pm from October 1995 - June 1998 and subsequently 2:55pm - 3:25pm from January 1999 - June 2002) with an occasional lunchtime slot at around 12 - 1pm (12:05pm - 12:30pm from February 1996 - May 1996 and again in January - March 1997, 12:25pm - 12:50pm from October - December 1998 and 12:30pm - 1pm from February - June 1999 and briefly in November 2001). The BBC introduced a new two hour Thursday evening Gaelic block on [[BBC Two Scotland]] in September 1993, including {{lang|gd|De a nis|italic=yes}}, Gaelic comedy, documentaries, music, and current affairs {{lang|gd|[[E\u00f2rpa]]|italic=yes}}. The programming block has continued until April 2011, virtually all the programmes were moved to [[BBC ALBA]] following the completion of the digital switchover with the exception of Children's Gaelic programmes which continued to be broadcast on weekday mornings during [[CBeebies]] until March 2013 and the long-running current affairs programme [[E\u00f2rpa]] until January 2019. E\u00f2rpa is currently being repeated on [[BBC Parliament]] on Saturday nights.\n\nThe [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] established a Gaelic Television Fund, administered by a Gaelic Television Committee ({{lang|gd|Comataidh Telebhisein G\u00e0idhlig|italic=yes}}).  The committee were given a \u00a39 million budget,<ref>Scottish Cinema Now edited by Jonathan Murray, Fidelma Farley, Rod Stoneman</ref> which was given independent producers, BBC, Grampian and STV.

A bilingual Scottish Pop Chart show, produced to commission by MFR ([[Moray Firth Radio]]) in Inverness is also broadcast each week on several of these stations.\n\n==Broadcasting for Gaelic learners==\nThe broadcasting media have also carried Gaelic lessons for learners of the language.  The first was a short radio series in 1934, six fortnightly Gaelic lessons in Gaelic by J. Nicolson. The weekly series ''Learning Gaelic'' by Edward Purcell with John M Bannerman and Archie Henry began in 1949.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/alba/tasglann/timeline/?era=1940 BBC ALBA - History Timeline] from [[BBC Online]]</ref>\n\nAmong the early BBC TV courses for beginners' Gaelic was {{lang|gd|[[Can Seo]]|italic=yes}} (1979).

As well as being informative, Gaelic broadcasting in Scotland has acquired some symbolic importance. Whilst [[opinion polls]] show that the vast majority of [[Gaels]] feel they have been ill-served by [[Scottish media|broadcasting media]],<ref name=\"bbctrust\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/consult/gaelic_digital_service/pva_research_p.pdf Summary of PVA Research] - [[BBC Online]] on behalf of the [[BBC Trust]].</ref> Scotland now has Gaelic broadcasting all over Scotland both on television and radio.\n\n==History==\n===1923\u20131945===\nThe first [[BBC]] radio broadcast in the Gaelic language was aired throughout [[Scotland]] on Sunday 2 December 1923; this was a 15-minute religious address by Rev. John Bain, recorded in the [[High kirk|High]] [[United Free Church]] in [[Aberdeen]].  Two weeks later, a recital of Gaelic singing was broadcast, though it was introduced in [[English language|English]].\n\nThe first regular programme was singer [[Neil MacLean (singer)|Neil MacLean]]'s {{lang|gd|Sgeulachdan agus Oran|italic=yes}} ('Stories and songs'), broadcast from the Aberdeen studio.  The first Gaelic radio play, entitled {{lang|gd|Dunach|italic=yes}}, was aired in 1933.  It is perhaps indicative of the status of Gaelic broadcasting at this time that the producer of {{lang|gd|Dunach|italic=yes}} knew no Gaelic.\n\nIn 1934 a series of lessons for Gaelic learners was broadcast.  In 1936, Scotland's first outside broadcast was a Gaelic service from [[Iona Abbey]].  In 1939 a weekly Gaelic news review was launched.\n\nIn 1935, Hugh MacPhee was appointed head of the BBC's first Gaelic department,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-1VRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LjQNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5559%2C2302193 |title=BBC Gaelic Assistant: {{lang|gd|An Comunn|nocat=y}} Official\u2019s Appointment |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |date=16 August 1935 |page=8 |accessdate=8 June 2016}}</ref> which moved to Glasgow in 1938; this seems to have been the first attempt to put Gaelic broadcasting on a serious footing.\n\nIn 1940, {{lang|gd|[[An Comunn G\u00e0idhealach]]|italic=no}} requested an increase of output to two news programmes and a children's programme each week.  This was refused, which resulted in questions being raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].\n\n===The post-war years===\nAfter the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Finlay J. Macdonald]] (later co-founder of {{lang|gd|[[Gairm]]|italic=yes}}) joined Hugh MacPhee in the [[Glasgow]] studios; he was replaced in 1954 by [[Fred Macaulay (Radio Producer)|Fred Macaulay]].  With two full-time producers, the regular programming was expanded to 90 minutes per week.  There was a Friday evening news slot which [[George Orwell]], writing at that time in [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], criticised for its \"amateurishness\".  A number of radio plays were produced, including {{lang|gd|An Tunnag Fhiadhaich|italic=yes}}, a translation by Lachlan MacKinnon of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''The Wild Duck'' (1951).\n\n===Television===\nBecause few areas of the [[West Highlands]] and virtually none of the [[islands of Scotland|islands]] could receive television signals before the early 1960s, Gaelic TV was not an issue at first, though there had been coverage of the {{lang|gd|[[Royal National M\u00f2d|M\u00f2d]]|italic=no}}.  As with radio, Gaelic TV broadcasting began with Gaelic songs introduced in English, such as {{lang|gd|Ce\u00f2l nan Gaidheal|italic=yes}} ('Music of the Gaels'), introduced by [[James Shaw Grant]] (1962).  The first genuine Gaelic TV programme was in the light entertainment category: {{lang|gd|[[Se Ur Beatha]]|italic=yes}} ('You're welcome') in 1964.  The first current affairs television series, {{lang|gd|Bonn Comhraidh|italic=yes}}, was launched in 1970.  Gaelic schools programmes began in 1975. The first Gaelic children's TV programme, {{lang|gd|Cuir Car|italic=yes}}, was aired in 1977, followed by ''Bzzz'' in 1981, and the first programme for pre-school children, {{lang|gd|Mag is Mog|italic=yes}}, in 1982.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vfE9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=6EgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2140%2C4976202 |title=Gaelic fun with Mag and Mag |first=Andrew |last=Young |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |date=30 January 1982 |page=9 |accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref> The pre-school \"classic\" {{lang|gd|[[D\u00f2taman]]|italic=yes}} was broadcast from 1985.\n\n===Radio Highland===\nIn 1976, BBC Radio Highland began broadcasting from [[Inverness]].

[[BBC One Scotland]] broadcast the programmes in the morning usually before  ''Children's BBC'' at 10:10{{snd}}10:30{{nbsp}}am, before moving to 9:45{{nbsp}}am in October 1986 as part of new BBC Daytime line up. Since then, the timeslots have varied for children's Gaelic programmes during the daytime hours varying from around 9am - 2pm on [[BBC One Scotland]] between 1987 - 1995, From October 1995, The new timeslots were mostly in the mid-afternoon (3pm - 3:30pm from October 1995 - June 1998 and subsequently 2:55pm - 3:25pm from January 1999 - June 2002) with an occasional lunchtime slot at around 12 - 1pm (12:05pm - 12:30pm from February 1996 - May 1996 and again in January - March 1997, 12:25pm - 12:50pm from October - December 1998 and 12:30pm - 1pm from February - June 1999 and briefly in November 2001).

E\u00f2rpa is currently being repeated on [[BBC Parliament]] on Saturday nights.\n\nThe [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] established a Gaelic Television Fund, administered by a Gaelic Television Committee ({{lang|gd|Comataidh Telebhisein G\u00e0idhlig|italic=yes}}).  The committee were given a \u00a39 million budget,<ref>Scottish Cinema Now edited by Jonathan Murray, Fidelma Farley, Rod Stoneman</ref> which was given independent producers, BBC, Grampian and STV.

Mouse''''' is an American [[surreal humour]] and [[psychological thriller]] [[Animated series#Television|animated television series]] created by [[Matt Maiellaro]] for [[Cartoon Network]]'s late-night programming block, [[Adult Swim]].<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=665}}</ref> The series revolves around Mouse Fitzgerald, nicknamed \"Fitz\" (voiced by Maiellaro), an alcoholic mouse who performs odd jobs so he can buy more beer. Together with his [[chinchilla]] companion Skillet, Fitz begins to recover [[memory inhibition|suppressed memories]] that he once had a wife and a child who have now vanished. This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world.\n\nIn producing the series, Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost-cutting measure; the series is animated by [[Radical Axis (studio)|Radical Axis]]. He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot, but established a [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]] format after starting the second episode. He had constructed an ending for the series as well as a detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned. Maiellaro cast people around his office for the characters, starring himself as the protagonist and [[Nine Pound Hammer]] vocalist Scott Luallen as the voice of Roostre; the band also performs the opening theme.\n\nThe [[pilot episode]] for ''12 oz. Mouse'', \"Hired\", premiered on June 19, 2005. The series became a regular staple of Adult Swim's lineup on October 23 of that year, and ended on December 17, 2006. Critical reception was polarized; some praised the series' experimental nature, while others felt confounded by it.\n\nThe June 14, 2018 episode of the Adult Swim streaming series ''Development Meeting'' featured a new clip from ''12 oz.

The show employs a serial format, and its ongoing storyline developed from [[absurdism|absurdist]] comedy to include mystery and [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] elements.<ref name=\"Norman2007\">{{cite web | url=http://www.shriekingtree.com/12_oz_Mouse/ | title=''12 oz.

This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world.\n\nFitz suspects there is a sinister conspiracy which appears to revolve around fields of \"{{sic|aspr|ind}}\" pills beneath the city, and Shark ([[Adam Reed]]), Clock, and Rectangular Businessman's (Kurt Soccolich) attempts to control the nature of time and reality. Fitz and Skillet receive help from Liquor ([[Matt Harrigan]]), Roostre (Scott Luallen), Stoned Peanut Cop (Nick Weidenfeld) and others as they engage in gun battles, blow things up, and try to understand cryptic hints. The show also sometimes contains surreal \"subliminal\" images that flash across the screen during key plot moments, including [[skull]]s, [[mustache]]d snake beasts and people screaming.\n\nThe series concludes with the revelation that Fitz has been kidnapped and placed into a simulation by the Shadowy Figure. He is about to be killed by Shark and the Rectangular Businessman, in their true forms outside the simulation, when he is rescued by the true form of Peanut Cop and a nurse who works in the simulation chamber. They kill Shark and Rectangle Businessman, but it is unknown if they are truly dead because the simulation in which most of the show takes place is probably taking place in another simulation. One of the purposes of the simulation seen in most of the show was to extract information from Fitz. The conclusion to episode 20 is ambiguous as to whether or not it is actually the end of the series, as some aspects of the plot remain unresolved&nbsp;\u2013 Golden Joe says \"I thought this was done,\" to which Fitz replies, \"I thought so too. I guess we're not.\"<ref name=\"Prolegomenon\">{{cite episode | title=Prolegomenon | publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] | date=December 17, 2006 | series=12 oz.

Golden Joe is carried away by birds, while later one night, Peanut Cop mysteriously disappears. Fitz and Skillet later meet a woman, Lee, who turns out to be a werewolf. Their fate at the end of the episode was unknown.\n\nIn 2018, a half-hour special episode aired, which continued the story. Fitz, now with a mustache and suffering from amnesia, is shown to be living in a new city during an unspecified amount of time after the original finale. Shark and Square Guy have returned somehow, and are trying to kidnap Fitz so they can return to the \"real\" world with the help of exterminator bee, Buzby ([[Dana Snyder]]). Skillet, Roostre, Peanut Cop, Golden Joe, and The New Guy ([[Mike Lazzo]]) must find and escape the simulation with Fitz before Shark and Square Guy do. The story is to continue in the third season, which is set to air in 2020.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Production===\nAccording to Maiellaro, the series was pitched as a [[table read]] to the network.

He provides the voice of the protagonist, Mouse Fitzgerald. He originally only gave the scratch dialogue for the character during production of the pilot episode, but chose himself to voice Mouse regularly after hearing his lines assembled in the final cut. Kurt Soccolich was chosen by Maiellaro to voice Rectangular Businessman, who \"already had that sort of smooth arrogance in his voice\", making him a \"perfect\" fit for him.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> [[Matt Harrigan]] was selected to voice Liquor, who is \"always looking to make light of a situation\", according to Maiellaro.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/>\n\nNick Weidenfeld provides the voice of Peanut Cop; Melissa Warrenburg portrays an annoying woman in a green sweater, who Maiellaro dubs \"Robogirl\". Bonnie Rosmarin voices Man/Woman, picked for what Maiellaro stated is a \"pouty, stand-offish quality\" in her delivery.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Nick Ingkatanuwat voices The Eye and Adam Reed plays Shark. Vocalist of [[Nine Pound Hammer]] Scott Luallen voices Roostre; the band also composed the opening theme song for the series. Golden Joe is voiced by Vishal Roney; after hearing his first take on the character, Maiellaro explained that he was left unable to write any of his lines. He proceeded to only provide the basic structure of his lines in the script, instructing him to [[retroscript]] the rest.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/>\n\n===Title sequence and music===\nMaiellaro spent three weeks working with Ingkatanuwat on putting together the set for the opening title sequence. The set was filmed with a [[Motion control photography|motion control camera]], and was inserted with miniature explosives and smoke bombs for [[special effect]]. Nine Pound Hammer composed the opening theme song; Maiellaro sought for a song representing the \"carefree\" lifestyle of Mouse who \"does things like drive drunk, film porno and shoot guns.\"<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Maiellaro, who plays the [[electric guitar]] in his free time, also composed the song \"F-Off\", featured in both the first episode and in \"Auraphull\", which he wrote while working on ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Swedish [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Amaranthe]] performed the credits theme song for the 2018 special, \"Invictus\".\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of 12 oz.

Together with his [[chinchilla]] companion Skillet, Fitz begins to recover [[memory inhibition|suppressed memories]] that he once had a wife and a child who have now vanished. This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world.\n\nIn producing the series, Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost-cutting measure; the series is animated by [[Radical Axis (studio)|Radical Axis]]. He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot, but established a [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]] format after starting the second episode. He had constructed an ending for the series as well as a detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned. Maiellaro cast people around his office for the characters, starring himself as the protagonist and [[Nine Pound Hammer]] vocalist Scott Luallen as the voice of Roostre; the band also performs the opening theme.\n\nThe [[pilot episode]] for ''12 oz. Mouse'', \"Hired\", premiered on June 19, 2005. The series became a regular staple of Adult Swim's lineup on October 23 of that year, and ended on December 17, 2006. Critical reception was polarized; some praised the series' experimental nature, while others felt confounded by it.\n\nThe June 14, 2018 episode of the Adult Swim streaming series ''Development Meeting'' featured a new clip from ''12 oz.

The show employs a serial format, and its ongoing storyline developed from [[absurdism|absurdist]] comedy to include mystery and [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] elements.<ref name=\"Norman2007\">{{cite web | url=http://www.shriekingtree.com/12_oz_Mouse/ | title=''12 oz.

This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world.\n\nFitz suspects there is a sinister conspiracy which appears to revolve around fields of \"{{sic|aspr|ind}}\" pills beneath the city, and Shark ([[Adam Reed]]), Clock, and Rectangular Businessman's (Kurt Soccolich) attempts to control the nature of time and reality. Fitz and Skillet receive help from Liquor ([[Matt Harrigan]]), Roostre (Scott Luallen), Stoned Peanut Cop (Nick Weidenfeld) and others as they engage in gun battles, blow things up, and try to understand cryptic hints. The show also sometimes contains surreal \"subliminal\" images that flash across the screen during key plot moments, including [[skull]]s, [[mustache]]d snake beasts and people screaming.\n\nThe series concludes with the revelation that Fitz has been kidnapped and placed into a simulation by the Shadowy Figure. He is about to be killed by Shark and the Rectangular Businessman, in their true forms outside the simulation, when he is rescued by the true form of Peanut Cop and a nurse who works in the simulation chamber. They kill Shark and Rectangle Businessman, but it is unknown if they are truly dead because the simulation in which most of the show takes place is probably taking place in another simulation. One of the purposes of the simulation seen in most of the show was to extract information from Fitz. The conclusion to episode 20 is ambiguous as to whether or not it is actually the end of the series, as some aspects of the plot remain unresolved&nbsp;\u2013 Golden Joe says \"I thought this was done,\" to which Fitz replies, \"I thought so too. I guess we're not.\"<ref name=\"Prolegomenon\">{{cite episode | title=Prolegomenon | publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] | date=December 17, 2006 | series=12 oz.

Golden Joe is carried away by birds, while later one night, Peanut Cop mysteriously disappears. Fitz and Skillet later meet a woman, Lee, who turns out to be a werewolf. Their fate at the end of the episode was unknown.\n\nIn 2018, a half-hour special episode aired, which continued the story. Fitz, now with a mustache and suffering from amnesia, is shown to be living in a new city during an unspecified amount of time after the original finale. Shark and Square Guy have returned somehow, and are trying to kidnap Fitz so they can return to the \"real\" world with the help of exterminator bee, Buzby ([[Dana Snyder]]). Skillet, Roostre, Peanut Cop, Golden Joe, and The New Guy ([[Mike Lazzo]]) must find and escape the simulation with Fitz before Shark and Square Guy do. The story is to continue in the third season, which is set to air in 2020.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Production===\nAccording to Maiellaro, the series was pitched as a [[table read]] to the network. He jokingly stated that they accepted it after claiming that production costs would total \"five dollars and will take some of the paper sitting in the copier.\"<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Maiellaro borrowed inspiration from [[surrealism]] and the films of [[David Lynch]].<ref name=\"Turner Content Solutions2009\">{{cite web | url=http://www.turnercontentsolutions.com/viewprogram/67C8C8C0-E415-4BA0-B99C-2E0662CD37E7 | title=''12 oz.

He provides the voice of the protagonist, Mouse Fitzgerald. He originally only gave the scratch dialogue for the character during production of the pilot episode, but chose himself to voice Mouse regularly after hearing his lines assembled in the final cut. Kurt Soccolich was chosen by Maiellaro to voice Rectangular Businessman, who \"already had that sort of smooth arrogance in his voice\", making him a \"perfect\" fit for him.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> [[Matt Harrigan]] was selected to voice Liquor, who is \"always looking to make light of a situation\", according to Maiellaro.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/>\n\nNick Weidenfeld provides the voice of Peanut Cop; Melissa Warrenburg portrays an annoying woman in a green sweater, who Maiellaro dubs \"Robogirl\". Bonnie Rosmarin voices Man/Woman, picked for what Maiellaro stated is a \"pouty, stand-offish quality\" in her delivery.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Nick Ingkatanuwat voices The Eye and Adam Reed plays Shark. Vocalist of [[Nine Pound Hammer]] Scott Luallen voices Roostre; the band also composed the opening theme song for the series. Golden Joe is voiced by Vishal Roney; after hearing his first take on the character, Maiellaro explained that he was left unable to write any of his lines. He proceeded to only provide the basic structure of his lines in the script, instructing him to [[retroscript]] the rest.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/>\n\n===Title sequence and music===\nMaiellaro spent three weeks working with Ingkatanuwat on putting together the set for the opening title sequence. The set was filmed with a [[Motion control photography|motion control camera]], and was inserted with miniature explosives and smoke bombs for [[special effect]]. Nine Pound Hammer composed the opening theme song; Maiellaro sought for a song representing the \"carefree\" lifestyle of Mouse who \"does things like drive drunk, film porno and shoot guns.\"<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Maiellaro, who plays the [[electric guitar]] in his free time, also composed the song \"F-Off\", featured in both the first episode and in \"Auraphull\", which he wrote while working on ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''.<ref name=\"Norman2007\"/> Swedish [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Amaranthe]] performed the credits theme song for the 2018 special, \"Invictus\".\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of 12 oz.

The roof was designed to be made of a clear, lightweight polymer material that can adjust its opacity to control light, and much of the exterior is clear polymer or glass to allow views to the outside.

It opened with two oversized locker rooms, each capable of housing 100 players, reflecting the much larger size of college football rosters compared to those of the NFL.

This only applies to concessions; cash is still accepted for ticket sales and any third-party merchandising that may operate during events, and kiosks are provided for loading cash onto prepaid debit cards (with no transaction fees charged).

However, many of Carpenter's films from the 1970s and the 1980s have come to be considered as [[Cult film|cult classics]], and he has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker. The cult classics that Carpenter has directed include ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974), ''[[Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 film)|Assault on Precinct 13]]'' (1976), ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), ''[[Christine (1983 film)|Christine]]'' (1983), ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' (1987), ''[[They Live]]'' (1988), and ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1995). He returned to the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' franchise]] as both composer and executive producer for the horror sequel ''[[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween]]'' (2018).\n\nCarpenter composed or co-composed most of his films' music. He won a [[Saturn Award for Best Music]] for the film ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998). Carpenter has released three studio albums, titled ''[[Lost Themes]]'' (2015), ''[[Lost Themes II]]'' (2016), and ''[[Anthology: Movie Themes 1974\u20131998]]'' (2017).\n\n==Early life==\nCarpenter was born on January 16, 1948 in [[Carthage, New York]], the son of Milton Jean (''n\u00e9e'' Carter) and Howard Ralph Carpenter, a music professor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/70/John-Carpenter.html|work=Film Reference|title=John Carpenter Biography (1948\u2013)}}</ref> He and his family relocated to [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]] during 1953.<ref name=kye>{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D.

The film reportedly cost only $60,000 and was difficult to make as both Carpenter and O'Bannon completed the film by multitasking, with Carpenter doing the musical score as well as the writing, producing, and directing, while O'Bannon acted in the film and did the special effects (which caught the attention of [[George Lucas]] who hired him to work with the special effects for the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'').

As with ''Dark Star'', Carpenter was responsible for many aspects of the film's creation. He not only wrote, directed, and scored it, but also edited the film using the pseudonym \"John T.

As also stated in the 2009 documentary ''Clarkworld'' (written and directed by Clark's former production designer Deren Abram after Clark's tragic death in 2007), Carpenter directly asked Clark about  his thoughts on developing the anonymous slasher in '' Black Christmas'': \n{{quote|...I did a film about three years later, started a film with John Carpenter, it was his first film for Warner Bros.

He said, \"Well what would you do if you did do a sequel?\" I said it would be the next year and the guy would have actually been caught, escape from a mental institution, go back to the house and they would start all over again. And I would call it 'Halloween'. The truth is John didn't copy 'Black Christmas', he wrote a script, directed the script, did the casting. 'Halloween' is his movie and besides, the script came to him already titled anyway. He liked 'Black Christmas' and may have been influenced by it, but in no way did John Carpenter copy the idea.

In order to make the film more coherent and frightening, Carpenter filmed additional footage that included a number of new scenes.\n\nDespite production problems and mostly negative critical reception, ''The Fog'' was another commercial success for Carpenter.

Moreover, unlike the Hawks film, ''The Thing'' was part of what Carpenter later called his \"Apocalypse Trilogy,\" a trio of films (''The Thing'', ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'', and ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'') with bleak endings for the film's characters.

''Christine'' did respectable business upon its release and was received well by critics; however, Carpenter has been quoted as saying he directed the film because it was the only thing offered to him at the time.<ref>Interview with John Carpenter on the DVD documentary film \"Christine: Ignition\"</ref>\n\n''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984) was produced by [[Michael Douglas]], the script was well received by [[Columbia Pictures]], which chose it in preference to the script for ''E.T.'' and prompted [[Steven Spielberg]] to go to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].

Salkind made the offer to Carpenter during lunch at The Ritz, and while he loved the idea of differing from his normal traditions and directing a children's fantasy film, he requested 24 hours to think about the offer. The next day he had made a list of requirements should he direct the film; they were: 100 percent creative control, the right to assume scriptwriting duties, being able to co-compose the film's musical score, total editorial control, the casting of [[Brian Dennehy]] as Santa Claus and a $5 million signing-on fee (the same amount that the film's star [[Dudley Moore]] was receiving). Salkind withdrew his offer for him to direct.\n\nAfter the financial failure of his big-budget action\u2013comedy ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), Carpenter struggled to get films financed. He resumed making lower budget films such as ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' (1987), a film influenced by the [[BBC]] series ''[[Quatermass]]''. Although some of the films from this time, such as ''[[They Live]]'' (1988) did develop a cult audience, he never again realized mass-market potential.\n\nCarpenter was also offered ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' during 1989, and met with writer [[William Peter Blatty]] (who also authored the novel on which it was based, ''[[Legion (Blatty novel)|Legion]]'') during the course of a week. However, the two disagreed about the film's climax and Carpenter refused the project. Blatty directed the film himself a year later. Carpenter said that although they argued about the ending, they had a mutual respect and talked about an interest they both shared: quantum physics.<ref>Gilles Boulenger.

Also notable from this decade are ''[[Body Bags (film)|Body Bags]]'', a television horror anthology film that was made in collaboration with [[Tobe Hooper]], ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1995), yet another Lovecraftian homage, which did not do well either commercially or with critics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_the_mouth_of_madness/ |title=In the Mouth of Madness |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> but now has a cult following,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/12/05/in-the-mouth-of-john-carpenters-misunderstood-masterpiece/ | title=In the Mouth of John Carpenter's Misunderstood Masterpiece | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=December 5, 2014 | accessdate=November 20, 2016 | author=Calia, Michael}}</ref> and ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998), which featured [[James Woods]] as the leader of a band of vampire hunters in league with the Catholic Church.\n\nCarpenter was originally in consideration to be the director for the ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) sequel project, ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998). Since [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], the main actress from the original and the sequel ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981), wanted to reunite the cast and crew of the original film, she asked Carpenter to direct ''Halloween H20: 20 Years Later''. Carpenter agreed to direct the film, but his starting fee as director was $10 million. Carpenter rationalized this by believing the hefty fee was compensation for revenue he had never received from the original ''Halloween'', a matter that was still a contention between Carpenter and ''Halloween'' producer [[Moustapha Akkad]] even after twenty years. When Akkad balked at Carpenter's fee, Carpenter quit the project. [[Steve Miner]] assumed directing of ''Halloween H20: 20 Years Later'', which was a commercial success despite receiving mixed reviews.\n\nDuring 1998, Carpenter composed the soundtrack (titled \"Earth/Air\") for the [[video game]] ''[[Sentinel Returns]]'', published for [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bestwesterngamesoundtracks.com/soundtracks/sentinel-returns-soundtrack/|title=Sentinel Returns Soundtrack \u2013 Review|date=May 14, 2015|website=Bestwesterngamessoundtracks.com|accessdate=December 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2000s: Semi-retirement===\n[[File:JohnCarpenter01.jpg|thumb|right|Carpenter in September 2001]]\nIn 2001, the film ''[[Ghosts of Mars]]'' was released.

Go home.\"\n\nDuring 2007, [[Rob Zombie]] produced and directed ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'', a re-imagining of Carpenter's 1978 film that resulted in a [[Halloween II (2009 film)|sequel]] two years later.\n\nCarpenter worked as director during 2005 for an episode of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime's]] ''[[Masters of Horror]]'' television series as one of the thirteen filmmakers involved in the first season. His episode, \"[[John Carpenter's Cigarette Burns|Cigarette Burns]]\", received generally positive reviews, and positive reactions from Carpenter fans, many of whom regard it as on par with his earlier horror classics. He has since contributed another original episode for the show's second season entitled \"[[Pro-Life (Masters of Horror)|Pro-Life]]\", about a young girl who is raped and impregnated by a demon and wants to have an abortion, but whose efforts are halted by her religious fanatic, gun-toting father and her three brothers.\n\n===2010s: ''The Ward'', focus on music and return to ''Halloween''===\n''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'', Carpenter's first film since 2001's ''[[Ghosts of Mars]]'', premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 13, 2010.

Although Carpenter has worked with various movie [[genres]], he is associated most commonly with [[horror film|horror]], [[action film|action]], and [[science fiction film]]s of the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/movies/john-carpenter-directs-the-ward.html|title=A Lord of Fright Reclaims His Dark Domain|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Jason Zinoman|date=June 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMost films of Carpenter's career were initially commercial and critical failures, with the notable exceptions of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[The Fog]]'' (1980), ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981), and ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984). However, many of Carpenter's films from the 1970s and the 1980s have come to be considered as [[Cult film|cult classics]], and he has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker. The cult classics that Carpenter has directed include ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974), ''[[Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 film)|Assault on Precinct 13]]'' (1976), ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), ''[[Christine (1983 film)|Christine]]'' (1983), ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' (1987), ''[[They Live]]'' (1988), and ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1995). He returned to the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' franchise]] as both composer and executive producer for the horror sequel ''[[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween]]'' (2018).\n\nCarpenter composed or co-composed most of his films' music. He won a [[Saturn Award for Best Music]] for the film ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998). Carpenter has released three studio albums, titled ''[[Lost Themes]]'' (2015), ''[[Lost Themes II]]'' (2016), and ''[[Anthology: Movie Themes 1974\u20131998]]'' (2017).\n\n==Early life==\nCarpenter was born on January 16, 1948 in [[Carthage, New York]], the son of Milton Jean (''n\u00e9e'' Carter) and Howard Ralph Carpenter, a music professor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/70/John-Carpenter.html|work=Film Reference|title=John Carpenter Biography (1948\u2013)}}</ref> He and his family relocated to [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]] during 1953.<ref name=kye>{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D.

The film was rediscovered in the USC archives in 2011 and proved interesting because it revealed elements that would appear in his later film, ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-carpenter-halloween-student-film-captain-voyeur-253747 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Mike | last=Barnes | title='Halloween' Director John Carpenter's First Student Film Unearthed | date=October 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe next year he collaborated with producer [[John Longenecker]] as co-writer, film editor, and music composer for ''[[The Resurrection of Broncho Billy]]'' (1970), which won an [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film]]. The short film was enlarged to [[35 mm movie film|35 mm]], sixty prints were made, and the film was released theatrically by Universal Studios for two years in the United States and Canada.\n\n===1970s: From student films to theatrical releases===\nCarpenter's first major film as director, ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974), was a science fiction comedy that he cowrote with [[Dan O'Bannon]] (who later went on to write ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', borrowing freely from much of ''Dark Star''). The film reportedly cost only $60,000 and was difficult to make as both Carpenter and O'Bannon completed the film by multitasking, with Carpenter doing the musical score as well as the writing, producing, and directing, while O'Bannon acted in the film and did the special effects (which caught the attention of [[George Lucas]] who hired him to work with the special effects for the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'').

As with ''Dark Star'', Carpenter was responsible for many aspects of the film's creation. He not only wrote, directed, and scored it, but also edited the film using the pseudonym \"John T. Chance\" (the name of [[John Wayne]]'s character in ''Rio Bravo''). Carpenter has said that he considers ''Assault on Precinct 13'' to have been his first real film because it was the first film that he filmed on a schedule.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldwasser |first=Dan |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/features/article/?id=12 |title=John Carpenter \u2013 Interview |publisher=Soundtrack.net |date=May 9, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> The film was the first time Carpenter worked with [[Debra Hill]], who played prominently in the making of some of Carpenter's most important films.\n\nCarpenter assembled a main cast that consisted of experienced but relatively obscure actors. The two main actors were [[Austin Stoker]], who had appeared previously in science fiction, disaster, and [[blaxploitation]] films, and [[Darwin Joston]], who had worked primarily for television and had once been Carpenter's next-door neighbor.<ref>Q & A session with John Carpenter and Austin Stoker at American Cinematheque's 2002 John Carpenter retrospective, in the ''Assault on Precinct 13'' 2003 special edition DVD.</ref>\n\nThe film received a critical reassessment in the United States, where it is now generally regarded as one of the best [[exploitation film]]s of the 1970s.<ref name=stills>Production Gallery (included in the 2003 special edition Region 1 DVD of ''Assault on Precinct 13''). 2003.</ref>\n\nCarpenter both wrote and directed the Lauren Hutton thriller ''[[Someone's Watching Me!]]''.

Originally an idea suggested by producer [[Irwin Yablans]] (titled ''The Babysitter Murders''), who thought of a film about babysitters being menaced by a stalker, Carpenter took the idea and another suggestion from Yablans that it occur during Halloween and developed a story.<ref name=\"scifi1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue339/interview.html |title=Syfy \u2013 Watch Full Episodes &#124; Imagine Greater |publisher=Scifi.com |date= |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> Carpenter said of the basic concept: \"Halloween night.

As also stated in the 2009 documentary ''Clarkworld'' (written and directed by Clark's former production designer Deren Abram after Clark's tragic death in 2007), Carpenter directly asked Clark about  his thoughts on developing the anonymous slasher in '' Black Christmas'': \n{{quote|...I did a film about three years later, started a film with John Carpenter, it was his first film for Warner Bros. (which picked up 'Black Christmas'), he asked me if I was ever gonna do a sequel and I said no. I was through with horror, I didn't come into the business to do just horror. He said, \"Well what would you do if you did do a sequel?\" I said it would be the next year and the guy would have actually been caught, escape from a mental institution, go back to the house and they would start all over again. And I would call it 'Halloween'. The truth is John didn't copy 'Black Christmas', he wrote a script, directed the script, did the casting. 'Halloween' is his movie and besides, the script came to him already titled anyway. He liked 'Black Christmas' and may have been influenced by it, but in no way did John Carpenter copy the idea. Fifteen other people at that time had thought to do a movie called 'Halloween' but the script came to John with that title on it.\n\n|author = Bob Clark, 2005\n|source = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iconsoffright.com/IV_BClark.htm|title=Bob Clark Interview |date=May 2005 |accessdate=February 22, 2020 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222200805/http://www.iconsoffright.com/IV_BClark.htm |archivedate=February 22, 2020 }}</ref>}} \nThe film was written by Carpenter and Debra Hill with Carpenter admitting that the music was inspired by both [[Dario Argento]]'s ''[[Suspiria]]'' (which also influenced the film's slightly surreal color scheme) and [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.<ref name=\"theofficialjohncarpenter.com\"/>\n\nCarpenter again worked with a relatively small budget, $300,000.<ref>Audio commentary by John Carpenter and Debra Hill in ''The Fog'', 2002 special edition DVD</ref> The film grossed more than $65 million initially, making it one of the most successful [[independent films]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houseofhorrors.com/halloween.htm |title=Halloween |publisher=Houseofhorrors.com |date= |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nCarpenter has described ''Halloween'' as: \"True crass exploitation.

After viewing a rough cut of the film, he was dissatisfied with the result. For the only time in his filmmaking career, he had to devise a way to salvage a nearly finished film that did not meet his standards. In order to make the film more coherent and frightening, Carpenter filmed additional footage that included a number of new scenes.\n\nDespite production problems and mostly negative critical reception, ''The Fog'' was another commercial success for Carpenter. The film was made on a budget of $1,000,000,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/rollingstone790628.html |title='THE FOG': A SPOOK RIDE ON FILM |access-date=March 16, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228140340/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/rollingstone790628.html |archive-date=February 28, 2015 |magazine= Rolling Stone | via = theofficialjohncarpenter.com }}</ref> but it grossed over $21,000,000 in the United States alone. Carpenter has said that ''The Fog'' is not his favorite film, although he considers it a \"minor horror classic\".<ref name=\"Audio\"/>\n\nCarpenter immediately followed ''The Fog'' with the science-fiction adventure ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981).

''The Thing'' was distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nAlthough Carpenter's film used the same source material as the 1951 Howard Hawks film, ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', it is more faithful to the [[John W. Campbell, Jr.]] novella, ''[[Who Goes There?]]'', upon which both films were based. Moreover, unlike the Hawks film, ''The Thing'' was part of what Carpenter later called his \"Apocalypse Trilogy,\" a trio of films (''The Thing'', ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'', and ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'') with bleak endings for the film's characters.

Salkind made the offer to Carpenter during lunch at The Ritz, and while he loved the idea of differing from his normal traditions and directing a children's fantasy film, he requested 24 hours to think about the offer. The next day he had made a list of requirements should he direct the film; they were: 100 percent creative control, the right to assume scriptwriting duties, being able to co-compose the film's musical score, total editorial control, the casting of [[Brian Dennehy]] as Santa Claus and a $5 million signing-on fee (the same amount that the film's star [[Dudley Moore]] was receiving). Salkind withdrew his offer for him to direct.\n\nAfter the financial failure of his big-budget action\u2013comedy ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), Carpenter struggled to get films financed. He resumed making lower budget films such as ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' (1987), a film influenced by the [[BBC]] series ''[[Quatermass]]''. Although some of the films from this time, such as ''[[They Live]]'' (1988) did develop a cult audience, he never again realized mass-market potential.\n\nCarpenter was also offered ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' during 1989, and met with writer [[William Peter Blatty]] (who also authored the novel on which it was based, ''[[Legion (Blatty novel)|Legion]]'') during the course of a week.

Also notable from this decade are ''[[Body Bags (film)|Body Bags]]'', a television horror anthology film that was made in collaboration with [[Tobe Hooper]], ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1995), yet another Lovecraftian homage, which did not do well either commercially or with critics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_the_mouth_of_madness/ |title=In the Mouth of Madness |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> but now has a cult following,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/12/05/in-the-mouth-of-john-carpenters-misunderstood-masterpiece/ | title=In the Mouth of John Carpenter's Misunderstood Masterpiece | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=December 5, 2014 | accessdate=November 20, 2016 | author=Calia, Michael}}</ref> and ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998), which featured [[James Woods]] as the leader of a band of vampire hunters in league with the Catholic Church.\n\nCarpenter was originally in consideration to be the director for the ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) sequel project, ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998). Since [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], the main actress from the original and the sequel ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981), wanted to reunite the cast and crew of the original film, she asked Carpenter to direct ''Halloween H20: 20 Years Later''. Carpenter agreed to direct the film, but his starting fee as director was $10 million. Carpenter rationalized this by believing the hefty fee was compensation for revenue he had never received from the original ''Halloween'', a matter that was still a contention between Carpenter and ''Halloween'' producer [[Moustapha Akkad]] even after twenty years. When Akkad balked at Carpenter's fee, Carpenter quit the project. [[Steve Miner]] assumed directing of ''Halloween H20: 20 Years Later'', which was a commercial success despite receiving mixed reviews.\n\nDuring 1998, Carpenter composed the soundtrack (titled \"Earth/Air\") for the [[video game]] ''[[Sentinel Returns]]'', published for [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bestwesterngamesoundtracks.com/soundtracks/sentinel-returns-soundtrack/|title=Sentinel Returns Soundtrack \u2013 Review|date=May 14, 2015|website=Bestwesterngamessoundtracks.com|accessdate=December 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2000s: Semi-retirement===\n[[File:JohnCarpenter01.jpg|thumb|right|Carpenter in September 2001]]\nIn 2001, the film ''[[Ghosts of Mars]]'' was released.

Go home.\"\n\nDuring 2007, [[Rob Zombie]] produced and directed ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'', a re-imagining of Carpenter's 1978 film that resulted in a [[Halloween II (2009 film)|sequel]] two years later.\n\nCarpenter worked as director during 2005 for an episode of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime's]] ''[[Masters of Horror]]'' television series as one of the thirteen filmmakers involved in the first season. His episode, \"[[John Carpenter's Cigarette Burns|Cigarette Burns]]\", received generally positive reviews, and positive reactions from Carpenter fans, many of whom regard it as on par with his earlier horror classics. He has since contributed another original episode for the show's second season entitled \"[[Pro-Life (Masters of Horror)|Pro-Life]]\", about a young girl who is raped and impregnated by a demon and wants to have an abortion, but whose efforts are halted by her religious fanatic, gun-toting father and her three brothers.\n\n===2010s: ''The Ward'', focus on music and return to ''Halloween''===\n''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'', Carpenter's first film since 2001's ''[[Ghosts of Mars]]'', premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 13, 2010.

{"title_page": "Complexity class", "text_new": "[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among several important complexity classes]]\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], a '''complexity class''' is a set of [[Computational problem|problems]] of related resource-based complexity. A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of allowable error. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 0. Another is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/2 for strings in the language and with error probability 0 for strings not in the language. Finally, the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time) is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/3. The class '''BPP''' is at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP'''\u2014the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine\u2014is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by the prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuit models====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the language <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in '''TIME'''<math>(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class in its own right because it turns out it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of allowable error. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 0. Another is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/2 for strings in the language and with error probability 0 for strings not in the language. Finally, the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time) is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/3. The class '''BPP''' is at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP'''\u2014the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine\u2014is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by the prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuit models====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the langauge <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in '''TIME'''<math>(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class in its own right because it turns out it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

It was unusual in that it was a [[maxi single]], playing at 33-1/3 rpm, whereas singles generally played at 45 rpm. It included an additional song also written and composed by Dorset, \"Mighty Man,\" on the A-side, and a much longer track, the [[Woody Guthrie]] song \"Dust Pneumonia Blues,\" on the B-side. As the record was sold in a picture sleeve, also not standard at the time, and only sold at a few pence more than the normal 45 rpm two-track single, it was considered value for money. A small quantity of 45 rpm discs on the Pye record label, with \"Mighty Man\" on the B-side, and without a picture sleeve, were pressed for use in [[jukebox]]es.

But I couldn't find a motorcycle. Howard Barry, the engineer had an old, well, it wasn't old then, a [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph]] sports car, which he drove past the studio while Barry Marrit was holding the microphone.

In 1970, it reached number one in charts around the world, including seven weeks on the [[UK Singles Chart]], two weeks on one of the [[RPM (magazine)|Canadian charts]], and number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart in the US.

It was unusual in that it was a [[maxi single]], playing at 33-1/3 rpm, whereas singles generally played at 45 rpm. It included an additional song also written and composed by Dorset, \"Mighty Man,\" on the A-side, and a much longer track, the [[Woody Guthrie]] song \"Dust Pneumonia Blues,\" on the B-side. As the record was sold in a picture sleeve, also not standard at the time, and only sold at a few pence more than the normal 45 rpm two-track single, it was considered value for money. A small quantity of 45 rpm discs on the Pye record label, with \"Mighty Man\" on the B-side, and without a picture sleeve, were pressed for use in [[jukebox]]es. These are now rare collector's items.\n\nIn 2012, Dorset sued his former management company Associated Music International, run by his former friend and business manager Eliot Cohen, claiming over \u00a32 million in [[royalties]] from the song that he believed had been withheld from him.<ref>{{cite web|title= Mungo Jerry Star Suing Over Alleged Unpaid Royalties |website= [[Contactmusic.com]] |date= 22 January 2012 |accessdate= 25 May 2014 |url= http://www.contactmusic.com/news/mungo-jerry-star-suing-over-alleged-unpaid-royalties_1285706}}</ref><!-- outcome unclear, so assuming out-of-court settlement with reporting restrictions-->\n\nIn an interview with Gary James, Dorset explained the origin of the \"motorcycle\" sound towards the false ending in the middle of the song: \"I said, 'We'll just get a recording of a motorcycle, stick it on the end of the song and then re-edit the front and then put the front off to the motorcycle so it starts up again.' But I couldn't find a motorcycle. Howard Barry, the engineer had an old, well, it wasn't old then, a [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph]] sports car, which he drove past the studio while Barry Marrit was holding the microphone. So, he got the stereo effects from left to right or right to left, whatever.

Cruickshank was awarded the VC for sinking a German U-boat and then, despite serious injuries, safely landing his aircraft. He is the last [[List of living Victoria Cross recipients|living recipient]] to have been awarded the VC during the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn on 20 May 1920 in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland, Cruickshank was educated at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], [[Edinburgh]],<ref>William C.

Apprentice Banker and Territorial Before the War', ''Scotsman'' (2 September 1944), p. 4.</ref> He was apprenticed to the Commercial Bank in Edinburgh.\n\n==Military service==\nWithin a year, on his father's suggestion, he joined the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]], enlisting in the [[Royal Artillery]] in May 1939; he served there until the summer of 1941 when he transferred to the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).<ref name=\"Scotsman\"/> He underwent flight training in Canada and the United States, earning his wings in July 1942. After further training, he was assigned to [[No. 210 Squadron RAF|No. 210 Squadron]] in March 1943, piloting [[Consolidated Aircraft|Consolidated]] [[PBY Catalina]] flying boats, flying from [[RAF Sullom Voe]].\n\nSullom Voe in [[Shetland]], now known for its oil terminal, was a flying-boat base during the Second World War. It was used by 210 Squadron of the Royal Air Force Coastal Command in its battle to keep the North Atlantic and Arctic sea lanes open for supply convoys. Flying Officer Cruickshank was twenty-four years old when he piloted a Consolidated Catalina anti-submarine flying boat from Sullom Voe on 17 July 1944 on a patrol north into the Norwegian Sea. The objective was to protect the British Home Fleet as it returned from the unsuccessful [[Operation Mascot]] raid on the [[German battleship Tirpitz|German battleship ''Tirpitz'']]. There the \"Cat\" caught a [[German Type VII submarine|German Type VIIC U-boat]] on the surface.\n\nAt this point in the war U-boats had been fitted with anti-aircraft guns as an attempt to counter the aerial threat. Cruickshank attacked the U-boat, flying his Catalina through a hail of flak. His first pass was unsuccessful, as his depth charges did not release. He brought the aircraft around for a second pass, this time straddling the U-boat and sinking it. All 52 crew members were lost. The U-boat was thought to be [[German submarine U-347|''U-347'']], as Cruickshank's VC citation states, but the boat was actually [[German submarine U-361|''U-361'']].\n\nThe German anti-aircraft fire had been deadly accurate, killing the navigator and injuring four others, including both Cruickshank and less seriously wounded second pilot Flight Sergeant Jack Garnett. Cruickshank was hit in seventy-two places, with two serious wounds to his lungs and ten penetrating wounds to his lower limbs. Despite this, he refused medical attention until he was sure that the appropriate radio signals had been sent and the aircraft was on course for its home base. Even then, he refused [[morphine]], aware that it would cloud his judgement. Flying through the night, it took the damaged Catalina five and a half hours to return to Sullom Voe, with Garnett at the controls and Cruickshank lapsing in and out of consciousness in the back. Cruickshank then returned to the cockpit and took command of the aircraft again. Deciding that the light and the sea conditions for a water landing were too risky for the inexperienced Garnett to put the aircraft down safely, he kept the flying boat in the air circling for an extra hour until he considered it safer, when they landed the Catalina on the water and taxied to an area where it could be safely beached.\n\nWhen the RAF medical officer boarded the aircraft, he discovered Cruickshank had lost a great deal of blood, and had to give him a transfusion before he was stable enough to be transferred to hospital.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1315709/Air-Vice-Marshal-Patrick-OConnor.html</ref>  John Cruickshank's injuries were such that he never flew in command of an aircraft again.

No. 210 Squadron.\n\nThis officer was the captain and pilot of a Catalina flying boat which was recently engaged on an  anti-submarine patrol over northern waters. When a U-boat was sighted on the surface, Flying Officer Cruickshank at once turned to the attack.  In the face of fierce anti-aircraft fire he manoeuvred into position and ran in to release his depth charges. Unfortunately they failed to drop.\n\nFlying Officer Cruickshank knew that the failure of this attack had deprived him of the advantage of surprise and that his aircraft offered a good target to the enemy's determined and now heartened gunners.\n\nWithout hesitation, he climbed and turned to come in again. The Catalina was met by intense and accurate fire and was repeatedly hit. The navigator/bomb aimer, was killed. The second pilot and two other members of the crew were injured. Flying Officer Cruickshank was struck in seventy-two places, receiving two serious wounds in the lungs and ten penetrating wounds in the lower limbs. His aircraft was badly damaged and filled with the fumes of exploding shells. But he did not falter. He pressed home his attack, and released the depth charges himself, straddling the submarine perfectly. The U-boat was sunk.\n\nHe then collapsed and the second pilot took over the controls. He recovered shortly afterwards and, though bleeding profusely, insisted on resuming command and retaining it until he was satisfied that the damaged aircraft was under control, that a course had been set for base and that all the necessary signals had been sent. Only then would he consent to receive medical aid and have his wounds attended to. He refused morphia in case it might prevent him from carrying on.\n\nDuring the next five and a half hours of the return flight he several times lapsed into unconsciousness owing to loss of blood.  When he came to his first thought on each occasion was for the safety of his aircraft and crew. The damaged aircraft eventually reached base but it was clear that an immediate landing would be a hazardous task for the wounded and less experienced second pilot. Although able to breathe only with the greatest difficulty, Flying Officer Cruickshank insisted on being carried forward and propped up in the second pilot's seat. For a full hour, in spite of his agony and ever-increasing weakness, he gave orders as necessary, refusing to allow the aircraft to be brought down until the conditions of light and sea made this possible without undue risk.\n\nWith his assistance the aircraft was safely landed on the water. He then directed the taxying and beaching of the aircraft so that it could easily be salvaged. When the medical officer went on board, Flying Officer Cruickshank collapsed and he had to be given a blood transfusion before he could be removed to hospital.\n\nBy pressing home the second attack in his gravely wounded condition and continuing his exertions on the return journey with his strength failing all the time, he seriously prejudiced his chance of survival even if the aircraft safely reached its base.

Following the release of the album, the band headlined a tour in Europe and participated in an American tour with [[Pelican (band)|Pelican]], [[Big Business (band)|Big Business]] and [[Breather Resist]].
