The competition worked brilliantly for months as a publicity stunt, and the resulting entries still reveal a unique turning point in American architectural history. More than 260 entries were received.\n\nThe winner was a [[neo-Gothic]] design by New York architects [[John Mead Howells]] and [[Raymond Hood]], with [[buttress]]es near the top.\n\nThe entry that many perceived as the best, by the [[Finland|Finnish]] architect [[Eliel Saarinen]], took second place and received $20,000. [[Eliel Saarinen's Tribune Tower design|Saarinen's tower]] was preferred by architects like [[Louis Sullivan]], and was a strong influence on the next generation of skyscrapers including Raymond Hood's own subsequent work on the [[330 West 42nd Street|McGraw-Hill Building]] and [[Rockefeller Center]]. The 1929 [[Gulf Building (Houston)|Gulf Building]] in [[Houston, Texas]], designed by architects [[Alfred C. Finn]], Kenneth Franzheim, and [[J. E. R.

[[C\u00e9sar Pelli]]'s [[181 West Madison Street]] Building in Chicago is also thought to be inspired by Saarinen's design.\n\nOther Tribune tower entries by figures like [[Walter Gropius]], [[Bertram Goodhue]], [[Bruno Taut]], and [[Adolf Loos]] remain intriguing suggestions of what might have been, but perhaps not as intriguing as the one surmounted by a Mount Rushmore-like head of an American Indian. These entries were originally published by the Tribune Company in 1923 under the title ''Tribune Tower Competition'' and later in ''The Chicago Tribune Tower Competition: Skyscraper Design and Cultural Change in the 1920s'' by Katherine Solomonson and Richard A. Etlin, 2001.\n\nIn the 1980 book entitled ''The Tribune Tower Competition'' published by Rizzoli, authors [[Robert A. M. Stern]], [[Stanley Tigerman]] as well as Bruce Abbey and other architects jokingly submitted \"late entries\" in Volume II of the work.\n\nArchival materials regarding the competition and the building are held by the [[Ryerson & Burnham|Ryerson & Burnham Libraries]] at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].\n\n==The building==\n\n===Design===\nBy 1922 the neo-Gothic skyscraper had become an established design tactic, with the first important so-called \"American Perpendicular Style\" at [[Cass Gilbert]]'s [[Woolworth Building]] of 1913. This was a late example, perhaps the last important example, and criticized for its perceived historicism. Construction on the Tribune Tower was completed in 1925 and reached a height of 462 feet (141&nbsp;m) above ground. The ornate buttresses surrounding the peak of the tower are especially visible when the tower is lit at night.\n\nAs was the case with most of Hood's projects, the sculptures and decorations were executed by the American artist [[Rene Paul Chambellan]]. The tower features carved images of [[Robin Hood]] (Hood) and a howling dog (Howells) near the main entrance to commemorate the architects. The top of the tower is designed after the ''Tour de beurre'' (\u2033butter tower\u2033) of the [[Rouen Cathedral]] in France,<ref name=\"chicagotribune\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-tribunetower-htmlstory-htmlstory.html|publisher=chicagotribune.com|title=Tribune Tower - Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2017-01-28}}</ref> which is characteristic of the [[Late-Gothic]] style, that is to say, without a spire but with a crown-shaped top.\n\nRene Paul Chambellan contributed his sculpture talents to the buildings ornamentation, gargoyles and the famous Aesops' Screen over the main entrance doors. Rene Chambellan worked on other projects with Raymond Hood including the [[American Radiator Building]] and [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City. Also, among the gargoyles on the Tribune Tower is one of a frog. That piece was created by Rene Chambellan to represent himself jokingly as he is of French ancestry.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Tribune Tower Chicago 2012-0244.jpg|Cornerstone of the tower\nFile:20080615 Wrigley Building clock and Tribune Tower from Sixteen.jpg|Tribune Tower along with Wrigley Building clock tower as seen from [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]]'s restaurant, [[Sixteen (restaurant)|Sixteen]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Collection of famous building fragments===\nPrior to the building of the Tribune Tower, correspondents for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' brought back rocks and bricks from a variety of historically important sites throughout the world at the request of [[Robert R. McCormick|Colonel McCormick]]. Many of these reliefs have been incorporated into the lowest levels of the building and are labeled with their location of origin. Stones included in the wall are from such sites as the [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]], [[Trondheim Cathedral]], [[Taj Mahal]], [[Clementine Hall]], the [[Parthenon]], [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Corregidor Island]], [[Palace of Westminster]], [[petrified wood]] from the [[Redwood National and State Parks]], the [[Great Pyramid at Giza|Great Pyramid]], [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|The Alamo]], [[Notre Dame de Paris]], [[Abraham Lincoln]]\u2019s [[Lincoln Tomb|Tomb]], the [[Great Wall of China]], [[Independence Hall]], [[Fort Santiago]], [[Angkor Wat]], Ta Prohm, [[Wawel Castle]], [[Banteay Srei]], and [[Rouen Cathedral]]'s Butter Tower, which inspired the shape of the building.<ref name=\"chicagoarchitecture\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoarchitecture.org/2013/03/05/pictures-of-all-149-rocks-stuck-on-the-tribune-tower/tribune-tower-rock-butter-tower-notre-dame-cathedral-rouen-france/|publisher=chicagoarchitecture.org|title=Tribune Tower rock &#8211; Butter Tower &#8211; Notre Dame Cathedral &#8211; Rouen &#8211; France :: Chicago Architecture|accessdate=2017-01-28}}</ref><ref name=\"chicagotribune\"/>\n\nSome of these had a political or social context such as the stone from the [[Berlin Wall]] and the column fragment of [[Wawel Castle]] located in its own niche over the upper-left corner of the main entrance, as a visual tribute{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} to [[Poles in Chicago|Chicago's large Polish population]], the largest such presence outside of the [[Republic of Poland]]. There are 149 fragments in the building. In 1999, during a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, [[Buzz Aldrin]] presented a rock brought from the [[Moon]], which was displayed in a window in the Tribune giftstore (it could not be added to the wall as [[NASA]] owns a large majority of the Apollo Moon rocks, and this one, within that category, was merely on loan to the Tribune).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/clip/35734377/chicago_tribune/|title=Sliver of Moon Brightens Michigan Avenue|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|location=Chicago, Illinois|last1=Manier|first1=Jeremy|date=July 22, 1999|page=197|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> The rock was removed in 2011 due to an outdated display.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2011-09-28-chi-tribune-tower-moon-rock-gone-but-new-one-to-take-its-place-20110928-story.html|title=Tribune Tower moon rock gone, but new one to take its place|newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=September 28, 2011|access-date=September 8, 2019}}</ref> A new rock display is planned but has not been installed {{asof|2018|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thenewchicagoan.com/chicago/tribune|title=How did Tribune Tower get all those stones?|website=The New Chicagoan|date=June 5, 2018|access-date=September 8, 2019}}</ref> A piece of steel recovered from the World Trade Center has been added to the wall.\n\n===Buildings influenced by the Tower===\nSeveral buildings around the world make reference to the design of the Tribune tower.

Stern]], [[Stanley Tigerman]] as well as Bruce Abbey and other architects jokingly submitted \"late entries\" in Volume II of the work.\n\nArchival materials regarding the competition and the building are held by the [[Ryerson & Burnham|Ryerson & Burnham Libraries]] at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].\n\n==The building==\n\n===Design===\nBy 1922 the neo-Gothic skyscraper had become an established design tactic, with the first important so-called \"American Perpendicular Style\" at [[Cass Gilbert]]'s [[Woolworth Building]] of 1913. This was a late example, perhaps the last important example, and criticized for its perceived historicism. Construction on the Tribune Tower was completed in 1925 and reached a height of 462 feet (141&nbsp;m) above ground. The ornate buttresses surrounding the peak of the tower are especially visible when the tower is lit at night.\n\nAs was the case with most of Hood's projects, the sculptures and decorations were executed by the American artist [[Rene Paul Chambellan]]. The tower features carved images of [[Robin Hood]] (Hood) and a howling dog (Howells) near the main entrance to commemorate the architects. The top of the tower is designed after the ''Tour de beurre'' (\u2033butter tower\u2033) of the [[Rouen Cathedral]] in France,<ref name=\"chicagotribune\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-tribunetower-htmlstory-htmlstory.html|publisher=chicagotribune.com|title=Tribune Tower - Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2017-01-28}}</ref> which is characteristic of the [[Late-Gothic]] style, that is to say, without a spire but with a crown-shaped top.\n\nRene Paul Chambellan contributed his sculpture talents to the buildings ornamentation, gargoyles and the famous Aesops' Screen over the main entrance doors. Rene Chambellan worked on other projects with Raymond Hood including the [[American Radiator Building]] and [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City. Also, among the gargoyles on the Tribune Tower is one of a frog. That piece was created by Rene Chambellan to represent himself jokingly as he is of French ancestry.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Tribune Tower Chicago 2012-0244.jpg|Cornerstone of the tower\nFile:20080615 Wrigley Building clock and Tribune Tower from Sixteen.jpg|Tribune Tower along with Wrigley Building clock tower as seen from [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]]'s restaurant, [[Sixteen (restaurant)|Sixteen]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Collection of famous building fragments===\nPrior to the building of the Tribune Tower, correspondents for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' brought back rocks and bricks from a variety of historically important sites throughout the world at the request of [[Robert R. McCormick|Colonel McCormick]]. Many of these reliefs have been incorporated into the lowest levels of the building and are labeled with their location of origin. Stones included in the wall are from such sites as the [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]], [[Trondheim Cathedral]], [[Taj Mahal]], [[Clementine Hall]], the [[Parthenon]], [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Corregidor Island]], [[Palace of Westminster]], [[petrified wood]] from the [[Redwood National and State Parks]], the [[Great Pyramid at Giza|Great Pyramid]], [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|The Alamo]], [[Notre Dame de Paris]], [[Abraham Lincoln]]\u2019s [[Lincoln Tomb|Tomb]], the [[Great Wall of China]], [[Independence Hall]], [[Fort Santiago]], [[Angkor Wat]], Ta Prohm, [[Wawel Castle]], [[Banteay Srei]], and [[Rouen Cathedral]]'s Butter Tower, which inspired the shape of the building.<ref name=\"chicagoarchitecture\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoarchitecture.org/2013/03/05/pictures-of-all-149-rocks-stuck-on-the-tribune-tower/tribune-tower-rock-butter-tower-notre-dame-cathedral-rouen-france/|publisher=chicagoarchitecture.org|title=Tribune Tower rock &#8211; Butter Tower &#8211; Notre Dame Cathedral &#8211; Rouen &#8211; France :: Chicago Architecture|accessdate=2017-01-28}}</ref><ref name=\"chicagotribune\"/>\n\nSome of these had a political or social context such as the stone from the [[Berlin Wall]] and the column fragment of [[Wawel Castle]] located in its own niche over the upper-left corner of the main entrance, as a visual tribute{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} to [[Poles in Chicago|Chicago's large Polish population]], the largest such presence outside of the [[Republic of Poland]]. There are 149 fragments in the building. In 1999, during a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, [[Buzz Aldrin]] presented a rock brought from the [[Moon]], which was displayed in a window in the Tribune giftstore (it could not be added to the wall as [[NASA]] owns a large majority of the Apollo Moon rocks, and this one, within that category, was merely on loan to the Tribune).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/clip/35734377/chicago_tribune/|title=Sliver of Moon Brightens Michigan Avenue|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|location=Chicago, Illinois|last1=Manier|first1=Jeremy|date=July 22, 1999|page=197|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> The rock was removed in 2011 due to an outdated display.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2011-09-28-chi-tribune-tower-moon-rock-gone-but-new-one-to-take-its-place-20110928-story.html|title=Tribune Tower moon rock gone, but new one to take its place|newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=September 28, 2011|access-date=September 8, 2019}}</ref> A new rock display is planned but has not been installed {{asof|2018|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thenewchicagoan.com/chicago/tribune|title=How did Tribune Tower get all those stones?|website=The New Chicagoan|date=June 5, 2018|access-date=September 8, 2019}}</ref> A piece of steel recovered from the World Trade Center has been added to the wall.\n\n===Buildings influenced by the Tower===\nSeveral buildings around the world make reference to the design of the Tribune tower. Most notably in Australia, the spires of the [[Grace Building (Sydney)|Grace Building]] in [[Sydney]] and the [[Manchester Unity Building]] in [[Melbourne]].\n\n===Freedom Museum===\nOn April 11, 2006 the [[McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum]] opened, occupying two stories of the building, including the previous location of high-end gift store [[Hammacher Schlemmer]]. The museum closed this location on March 1, 2009 and redirected its efforts to become an online museum.\n\n===Open House Chicago===\nTribune Tower has participated in [[Chicago Architecture Foundation]]'s event [[Open House Chicago]] every year, starting in 2011. This annual opportunity allows visitors to tour the interior of the building for free.<ref name=\"chicagotribune2\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-10-13/entertainment/ct-ent-1013-openhouse-overview-20111014_1_chicago-architecture-foundation-sites-lake-point-tower |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |title=Open House Chicago architectural walking tour - tribunedigital-chicagotribune|accessdate=2017-01-28}}</ref><ref name=\"curbed\">{{cite web|url=http://chicago.curbed.com/archives/2012/10/17/open-house-2012-chicago-tribune-towers.php|publisher=Curbed Chicago |title=The Immensely Gratifying and Deceptively Short Tribune Tower |accessdate=2017-01-28}}</ref><ref name=\"openhousechicago\">{{cite web|url=http://openhousechicago.org/sites/|publisher=openhousechicago.org|title=Sites&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Open House Chicago|accessdate=2017-01-28}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* On the November 21 and 28, 2007 in episodes entitled \"One Wedding and a Funeral\" and \"The Thing About Heroes\" of the television series ''[[CSI: NY]]'', historical pieces stolen from the building led [[Mac Taylor]] ([[Gary Sinise]]) to his hometown of [[Chicago]]. Upon further investigation of the man stalking him, Taylor found a dead body in an office of an unused floor in the building. The episodes were filmed entirely on location in Chicago.\n* [[Conan O'Brien]] was seen running past the tower while en route from [[New York City|New York]] to [[Los Angeles]] on his first episode as host of ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]''.\n* The snipers in ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'' are shooting from the 26th floor of Tribune Tower just below the buttresses.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Chicago}}\n* [[Chicago architecture]]\n* [[Open House Chicago]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Tribune Tower}}\n* {{Structurae|id=20000244|title=Chicago Tribune Tower}}\n* [http://archiseek.com/2009/1925-chicago-tribune-tower-chicago-illinois/ 1925 \u2013 Chicago Tribune Tower, Chicago, Illinois] at Archiseek\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170303220751/https://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/fa267/20th/tribune_saarinen.jpg Saarinen's second place entry]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080626145002/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chicago-tribune-tower-zell-jun25,0,3211701.story/ \"Tribune Tower could be for sale\"&nbsp;\u2013 ''Chicago Tribune'', June 25, 2008]\n* [http://www.jitterbuzz.com/trib_tower.html Impact of competition entries on skyscraper design]\n* [http://www.thecrownchicago.com/ The Crown at the Tribune Tower]\n* [http://www.howellsandhood.com/ Howells & Hood restaurant]\n* [http://www.tribunetowerevents.com/ Tribune Tower Events]\n* [https://mcid.mcah.columbia.edu/art-atlas/modern-architecture-chicago/tribune-tower Tribune Tower] at Art Atlas\u2014high-resolution 360\u00b0 panoramas and images\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Articles and topics related to Tribune Tower\n|state=collapsed\n|list1=\n{{Near North Side, Chicago}}\n{{Chicago Landmark skyscrapers}}\n{{Chicago skyscrapers}}\n{{Chicago}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Central Chicago]]\n[[Category:Chicago Tribune]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Newspaper headquarters in the United States]]\n[[Category:Newspaper buildings]]\n[[Category:Media company headquarters in the United States]]\n[[Category:Office buildings completed in 1925]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival skyscrapers]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Illinois]]\n[[Category:1925 establishments in Illinois]]\n", "name_user": "Hmains", "label": "safe", "comment": "category refine, sort sequence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribune_Tower"}

On 22 November 1916, the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|Spanish Football Federation]] proposed that the clubs from [[Cantabria]] move from the Northern Federation, where the Basque teams were integrated, to the Regional Cantabric one, with the Asturian clubs.\n\nWith the name of ''Cantabric team'', it played four official matches between 1917 and 1918 in the defunct [[:es:Copa del Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias de f\u00fatbol|Copa Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias]], organised by the Spanish Federation and played by all the Spanish Regional teams.<ref name=principe>{{cite web|url=http://www.cihefe.es/cuadernosdefutbol/2009/09/la-copa-principe-de-asturias/|title=La Copa Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias|trans-title=The Prince of Asturias Cup|language=es|publisher=[[:es:Centro de Investigaciones de Historia y Estad\u00edstica del F\u00fatbol Espa\u00f1ol|CIHEFE]]|author=Vicente Mart\u00ednez Calatrava|date=17 August 2009|accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Asturian Federation===\nOn 28 May 1918 the Cantabrian clubs moved back to the Northern Federation, so the Spanish Federation agreed to change the name of the Cantabric Federation to ''[[Royal Asturias Football Federation|Regional Asturian Federation of Football Clubs]].''

During the 1930s, the Asturian team continued playing several friendly games until the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\n===Revival in the 2000s===\nOn 23 December 2000, the Royal Asturian Football Federation rescued the Regional team to play a friendly game at [[Estadio Carlos Tartiere]] against [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]]. [[Juanele]] scored the only goal of the match, with 30,000 people filling the stadium in [[Oviedo]].
