These include a series of biological, social, economic, political and religious upheavals which had profound effects on the course of [[world history]], especially the [[History of Europe]]. Often simply referred to as \"The Plague\", the Black Death was one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, peaking in Europe between 1348 and 1350 with an estimated one-third of the continent's population ultimately succumbing to the disease. Historians estimate that it reduced the total [[world population]] from 475 million to between 350 and 375 million. In most parts of Europe, it took nearly 80 years for population sizes to recover, and in some areas more than 150 years.\n\nFrom the perspective of many of the survivors, the effect of the plague may have been ultimately favorable, as the massive reduction of the workforce meant their labor was suddenly in higher demand. [[R. H. Hilton]] has argued that those English peasants who survived found their situation to be much improved. For many Europeans, the 15th century was a [[golden age]] of prosperity and new opportunities. The land was plentiful, wages high, and [[serfdom]] had all but disappeared. A century later, as [[population growth]] resumed, the lower classes again faced deprivation and famine.<ref>Barbara A.

Larger cities were the worst off, as population densities and close living quarters made disease transmission easier. Cities were also strikingly filthy, infested with [[Louse|lice]], [[flea]]s, and [[rat]]s, and subject to diseases caused by malnutrition and poor [[hygiene]].<ref>According to Kelly (2005), \"[w]oefully inadequate sanitation made medieval urban Europe so disease-ridden, no city of any size could maintain its population without a constant influx of immigrants from the countryside\". The influx of new citizens facilitated the movement of the plague between communities and contributed to the longevity of the plague within larger communities. Kelly, John.

Other areas which escaped the plague were isolated in mountainous regions (e.g. the [[Pyrenees]]).\n\nAll social classes were affected, although the lower classes, living together in unhealthy places, were most vulnerable. [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] and [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan of Navarre]] (daughter of [[Louis X of France|Louis X ''le Hutin'']] and [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]]) were the only European monarch to die of the plague, but [[Peter IV of Aragon]] lost [[Eleanor of Portugal, Queen of Aragon|his wife]], his daughter, and a niece in six months.

Mortality was particularly high in rural areas, including significant areas of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and [[Syria]]. Many rural people fled, leaving their fields and crops, and entire rural provinces are recorded as being totally depopulated. Surviving records in some cities reveal a devastating number of deaths. The 1348 outbreak in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] left an estimated 10,000 people dead, while [[Aleppo]] recorded a death rate of 500 per day during the same year. In [[Damascus]], at the disease's peak in September and October 1348, a thousand deaths were recorded every day, with overall mortality estimated at between 25 and 38 percent. [[Syria]] lost a total of 400,000 people by the time the epidemic subsided in March 1349. In contrast to some higher mortality estimates in Asia and Europe, scholars such as John Fields of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in Dublin believe the mortality rate in the Middle East was less than one-third of the total population, with higher rates in selected areas.\n\n==Social, environmental, and economic effects==\n\nBecause 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause of the Black Death, many Europeans ascribed supernatural forces, earthquakes and malicious conspiracies, among other things, as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.<ref name=Bennett-329>{{cite book|title=Medieval Europe: A Short History |author1 =Judith M.

At best, they proved mostly unenforceable. At worst, they contributed to a continent-wide downward spiral. The hardest hit lands, like England, were unable to buy grain abroad from France because of the prohibition and from most of the rest of the grain producers because of crop failures from shortage of labour. Any grain that could be shipped was eventually taken by [[piracy|pirates]] or [[looters]] to be sold on the black market. Meanwhile, many of the largest countries, most notably England and Scotland, had been at war, using up much of their [[treasury]] and exacerbating [[inflation]]. In 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what would become known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Malnutrition, poverty, disease and hunger, coupled with war, growing inflation and other economic concerns made Europe in the mid-14th century ripe for tragedy.\n\nEurope had been [[Human overpopulation|overpopulated]] before the plague, and a reduction of 30 to 50 percent of the population could have resulted in higher wages and more available land and food for peasants because of less competition for resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yahoo.com/|title=Yahoo|website=Yahoo}}</ref> Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] contends that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the Black Death had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labour, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered [[economic inequality]] by making landowners and employers less well off while improving the lot of the workers. He states that \"the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations.\" This leveling effect was reversed by a \"demographic recovery that resulted in renewed population pressure.\"<ref>{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|pages=292\u201393, 304}}</ref> In 1357, a third of property in London was unused due to a severe outbreak in 1348\u201349.<ref name=guardian811/> However, for reasons that are still debated, population levels declined after the Black Death's first outbreak until around 1420 and did not begin to rise again until 1470, so the initial Black Death event on its own does not entirely provide a satisfactory explanation to this extended period of decline in prosperity. See [[Medieval demography]] for a more complete treatment of this issue and current theories on why improvements in living standards took longer to evolve.\n\n===Effect on the peasantry===\n\nThe great population loss brought favourable results to the surviving peasants in England and Western Europe. There was increased social mobility, as depopulation further eroded the peasants' already weakened obligations to remain on their traditional holdings. [[Seigneurialism]] never recovered. Land was plentiful, wages high, and serfdom had all but disappeared. It was possible to move about and rise higher in life. Younger sons and women especially benefited.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jay O'Brien|author2=William Roseberry|title=Golden Ages, Dark Ages: Imagining the Past in Anthropology and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Is3mtuIZ9cC&pg=PA25|year=1991|publisher=U. of California Press|page=25|isbn=978-0-520-07018-9}}</ref> As population growth resumed, however, the peasants again faced deprivation and famine.<ref name=\"reference\" /><ref>Barbara A.

Sparsely populated Eastern Europe was less affected by the Black Death and so peasant revolts were less common in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, not occurring in the east until the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries.\n\nFurthermore, the plague's great population reduction brought cheaper land prices, more food for the average peasant, and a relatively large increase in per capita income among the peasantry, if not immediately, in the coming century.<ref name=econ/> Since the plague left vast areas of farmland untended, they were made available for pasture and put more meat on the market; the consumption of meat and dairy products went up, as did the export of beef and butter from the Low Countries, Scandinavia and northern Germany. However, the upper class often attempted to stop these changes, initially in Western Europe, and more forcefully and successfully in Eastern Europe, by instituting [[sumptuary law]]s. These regulated what people (particularly of the peasant class) could wear, so that nobles could ensure that peasants did not begin to dress and act as a higher class member with their increased wealth. Another tactic was to fix prices and wages so that peasants could not demand more with increasing value. In England, the [[Statute of Labourers 1351]] was enforced, meaning no peasant could ask for more wages than in 1346.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/YALDstatute.htm|title=Statute of Labourers Act|website=Spartacus Educational}}</ref> This was met with varying success depending on the amount of rebellion it inspired; such a law was one of the causes of the 1381 [[Peasants' Revolt]] in [[England in the Middle Ages|England]].\n\nThe rapid development of the [[Use (law)|use]] was probably one of the consequences of the Black Death, during which many landowning nobility died, leaving their realty to their widows and minor orphans.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Effect on urban workers===\n\nIn the wake of the drastic population decline brought on by the plague, wages shot up and labourers could move to new localities in response to wage offers.

Instead, he says the energetic local and royal measures to control labor and artisans' prices was a response to elite fears of the greed and possible new powers of lesser classes that had gained new freedom.

The manorial system was already in trouble, but the Black Death assured its demise throughout much of western and central Europe by 1500.

This resulted in much lower rents in western Europe. By 1500, a new form of tenure called copyhold became prevalent in Europe. In copyhold, both a Lord and peasant made their best business deal, whereby the peasant got use of the land and the Lord got a fixed annual payment and both possessed a copy of the tenure agreement. Serfdom did not end everywhere. It lingered in parts of Western Europe and was introduced to Eastern Europe after the Black Death.<ref name=\"The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe\"/>\n\nThere was change in the inheritance law.

Byrne, ''The Black Death'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2004), 108.</ref> Byrne writes that in 1438, the sultan of Cairo was informed by his religious lawyers that the arrival of the plague was Allah's punishment for the sin of [[fornication]] and that in accordance with this theory, a law was set in place stating that women were not allowed to make public appearances as they may tempt men into sin. Byrne describes that this law was only lifted when \"the wealthy complained that their female servants could not shop for food.\"<ref name=byrne/>\n\n===Religion===\n\nThe Black Death hit the [[monastery|monasteries]] very hard because of their proximity with the sick who sought refuge there. This left a severe shortage of clergy after the epidemic cycle. Eventually the losses were replaced by hastily trained and inexperienced clergy members, many of whom knew little of the rigors of their predecessors. New colleges were opened at established universities, and the training process sped up.<ref>Steven A. Epstein, ''An Economic and Social History of Later Medieval Europe, 1000\u20131500'' (2009) p. 182</ref> The shortage of priests opened new opportunities for laywomen to assume more extensive and more important service roles in the local parish.<ref>Katherine L.

The movement became popular after the Black Death. It may be that the flagellants' later involvement in hedonism was an effort to accelerate or absorb God's wrath, to shorten the time with which others suffered. More likely, the focus of attention and popularity of their cause contributed to a sense that the world itself was ending and that their individual actions were of no consequence.\n\nReformers rarely pointed to failures on the part of the Church in dealing with the catastrophe.<ref>Epstein, p. 182</ref>\n\n==Cultural effect==\n{{Main|Black Death in medieval culture}}\n[[File:Trionfo della morte, gi\u00e0 a palazzo sclafani, galleria regionale di Palazzo Abbatellis, palermo (1446) , affresco staccato.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Triumph of Death (Palermo)|The Triumph of Death]]'' (1446)]]\n\nThe Black Death had a profound effect on art and literature. After 1350, [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] in general turned very morbid. The general mood was one of pessimism, and contemporary art turned dark with representations of death. The widespread image of the \"dance of death\" showed death (a skeleton) choosing victims at random. Many of the most graphic depictions come from writers such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]].<ref>J. M. Bennett and C. W.

The basic Gothic style was revamped with elaborate decoration in the late medieval period. Sculptors in Italian city-states emulated the work of their Roman forefathers while sculptors in northern Europe, no doubt inspired by the devastation they had witnessed, gave way to a heightened expression of emotion and an emphasis on individual differences.<ref>Bennett and Hollister, p. 375.</ref> A tough realism came forth in architecture as in literature. Images of intense sorrow, decaying corpses, and individuals with faults as well as virtues emerged. North of the Alps, painting reached a pinnacle of precise realism with [[Early Dutch painting]] by artists such as [[Jan van Eyck]] (c. 1390\u2013by 1441). The natural world was reproduced in these works with meticulous detail whose realism was not unlike photography.<ref>Bennett and Hollister, p. 376.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n[[Depopulation#Economic Consequences]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{ibid|date=March 2018}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n{{col-begin|2}}\n{{col-break}}\n* Aberth, John, ed.

These include a series of biological, social, economic, political and religious upheavals which had profound effects on the course of [[world history]], especially the [[History of Europe]]. Often simply referred to as \"The Plague\", the Black Death was one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, peaking in Europe between 1348 and 1350 with an estimated one-third of the continent's population ultimately succumbing to the disease. Historians estimate that it reduced the total [[world population]] from 475 million to between 350 and 375 million. In most parts of Europe, it took nearly 80 years for population sizes to recover, and in some areas more than 150 years.\n\nFrom the perspective of many of the survivors, the effect of the plague may have been ultimately favorable, as the massive reduction of the workforce meant their labor was suddenly in higher demand. [[R. H. Hilton]] has argued that those English peasants who survived found their situation to be much improved. For many Europeans, the 15th century was a [[golden age]] of prosperity and new opportunities. The land was plentiful, wages high, and [[serfdom]] had all but disappeared. A century later, as [[population growth]] resumed, the lower classes again faced deprivation and famine.<ref>Barbara A.

Larger cities were the worst off, as population densities and close living quarters made disease transmission easier.

Mortality was particularly high in rural areas, including significant areas of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and [[Syria]]. Many rural people fled, leaving their fields and crops, and entire rural provinces are recorded as being totally depopulated. Surviving records in some cities reveal a devastating number of deaths. The 1348 outbreak in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] left an estimated 10,000 people dead, while [[Aleppo]] recorded a death rate of 500 per day during the same year. In [[Damascus]], at the disease's peak in September and October 1348, a thousand deaths were recorded every day, with overall mortality estimated at between 25 and 38 percent. [[Syria]] lost a total of 400,000 people by the time the epidemic subsided in March 1349. In contrast to some higher mortality estimates in Asia and Europe, scholars such as John Fields of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in Dublin believe the mortality rate in the Middle East was less than one-third of the total population, with higher rates in selected areas.\n\n==Social, environmental, and economic effects==\n\nBecause 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause of the Black Death, many Europeans ascribed supernatural forces, earthquakes and malicious conspiracies, among other things, as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.<ref name=Bennett-329>{{cite book|title=Medieval Europe: A Short History |author1 =Judith M.

At best, they proved mostly unenforceable. At worst, they contributed to a continent-wide downward spiral. The hardest hit lands, like England, were unable to buy grain abroad from France because of the prohibition and from most of the rest of the grain producers because of crop failures from shortage of labour. Any grain that could be shipped was eventually taken by [[piracy|pirates]] or [[looters]] to be sold on the black market. Meanwhile, many of the largest countries, most notably England and Scotland, had been at war, using up much of their [[treasury]] and exacerbating [[inflation]]. In 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what would become known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Malnutrition, poverty, disease and hunger, coupled with war, growing inflation and other economic concerns made Europe in the mid-14th century ripe for tragedy.\n\nEurope had been [[Human overpopulation|overpopulated]] before the plague, and a reduction of 30 to 50 percent of the population could have resulted in higher wages and more available land and food for peasants because of less competition for resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yahoo.com/|title=Yahoo|website=Yahoo}}</ref> Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] contends that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the Black Death had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labour, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered [[economic inequality]] by making landowners and employers less well off while improving the lot of the workers. He states that \"the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations.\" This leveling effect was reversed by a \"demographic recovery that resulted in renewed population pressure.\"<ref>{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|pages=292\u201393, 304}}</ref> In 1357, a third of property in London was unused due to a severe outbreak in 1348\u201349.<ref name=guardian811/> However, for reasons that are still debated, population levels declined after the Black Death's first outbreak until around 1420 and did not begin to rise again until 1470, so the initial Black Death event on its own does not entirely provide a satisfactory explanation to this extended period of decline in prosperity. See [[Medieval demography]] for a more complete treatment of this issue and current theories on why improvements in living standards took longer to evolve.\n\n===Effect on the peasantry===\n\nThe great population loss brought favourable results to the surviving peasants in England and Western Europe. There was increased social mobility, as depopulation further eroded the peasants' already weakened obligations to remain on their traditional holdings. [[Seigneurialism]] never recovered. Land was plentiful, wages high, and serfdom had all but disappeared. It was possible to move about and rise higher in life. Younger sons and women especially benefited.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jay O'Brien|author2=William Roseberry|title=Golden Ages, Dark Ages: Imagining the Past in Anthropology and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Is3mtuIZ9cC&pg=PA25|year=1991|publisher=U. of California Press|page=25|isbn=978-0-520-07018-9}}</ref> As population growth resumed, however, the peasants again faced deprivation and famine.<ref name=\"reference\" /><ref>Barbara A.

Sparsely populated Eastern Europe was less affected by the Black Death and so peasant revolts were less common in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, not occurring in the east until the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries.\n\nFurthermore, the plague's great population reduction brought cheaper land prices, more food for the average peasant, and a relatively large increase in per capita income among the peasantry, if not immediately, in the coming century.<ref name=econ/> Since the plague left vast areas of farmland untended, they were made available for pasture and put more meat on the market; the consumption of meat and dairy products went up, as did the export of beef and butter from the Low Countries, Scandinavia and northern Germany. However, the upper class often attempted to stop these changes, initially in Western Europe, and more forcefully and successfully in Eastern Europe, by instituting [[sumptuary law]]s. These regulated what people (particularly of the peasant class) could wear, so that nobles could ensure that peasants did not begin to dress and act as a higher class member with their increased wealth. Another tactic was to fix prices and wages so that peasants could not demand more with increasing value. In England, the [[Statute of Labourers 1351]] was enforced, meaning no peasant could ask for more wages than in 1346.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/YALDstatute.htm|title=Statute of Labourers Act|website=Spartacus Educational}}</ref> This was met with varying success depending on the amount of rebellion it inspired; such a law was one of the causes of the 1381 [[Peasants' Revolt]] in [[England in the Middle Ages|England]].\n\nThe rapid development of the [[Use (law)|use]] was probably one of the consequences of the Black Death, during which many landowning nobility died, leaving their realty to their widows and minor orphans.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Effect on urban workers===\n\nIn the wake of the drastic population decline brought on by the plague, wages shot up and labourers could move to new localities in response to wage offers.

Instead, he says the energetic local and royal measures to control labor and artisans' prices was a response to elite fears of the greed and possible new powers of lesser classes that had gained new freedom. Cohn says the laws reflect the anxiety that followed the Black Death's new horrors of mass mortality and destruction, and from elite anxiety about manifestations such as the flagellant movement and the persecution of Jews, Catalans (in Sicily), and beggars.<ref>Samuel Cohn, \"After the Black Death: Labour Legislation and Attitudes Towards Labour in Late-Medieval Western Europe,\" ''Economic History Review'' (2007) 60#3 pp. 457\u201385 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4502106 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===Labour-saving innovation===\nBy 1200, virtually all of the Mediterranean basin and most of northern Germany had been deforested and cultivated. Indigenous flora and fauna were replaced by domestic grasses and animals and domestic woodlands were lost. With depopulation, this process was reversed. Much of the primeval vegetation returned, and abandoned fields and pastures were reforested.<ref name=\"The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe\"/>\n\nThe Black Death encouraged innovation of labour-saving technologies, leading to higher productivity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plagued by dear labour|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/10/economic-history-1|work=The Economist|accessdate=5 August 2014|location=London|date=21 October 2013}}</ref> There was a shift from grain farming to animal husbandry. Grain farming was very labor-intensive, but animal husbandry needed only a shepherd and a few dogs and pastureland.<ref name=\"The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe\"/>\n\nPlague brought an eventual end of Serfdom in Western Europe. The manorial system was already in trouble, but the Black Death assured its demise throughout much of western and central Europe by 1500. Severe depopulation and migration of the village to cities caused an acute shortage of agricultural labourers. Many villages were abandoned. In England, more than 1300 villages were deserted between 1350 and 1500.<ref name=\"The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe\">{{cite book|last=Gottfried|first=Robert S.|title=The black death: natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe|year=1983|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-912630-4 |edition=1.

This resulted in much lower rents in western Europe. By 1500, a new form of tenure called copyhold became prevalent in Europe. In copyhold, both a Lord and peasant made their best business deal, whereby the peasant got use of the land and the Lord got a fixed annual payment and both possessed a copy of the tenure agreement. Serfdom did not end everywhere. It lingered in parts of Western Europe and was introduced to Eastern Europe after the Black Death.<ref name=\"The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe\"/>\n\nThere was change in the inheritance law. Before the plague, only sons and especially the elder son inherited the ancestral property. Post plague all sons as well as daughters started inheriting property.<ref name=\"The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe\"/>\n\n===Persecutions===\n{{See also|Black Death Jewish persecutions}}\n\nRenewed religious fervor and fanaticism came in the wake of the Black Death. Some Europeans targeted \"groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims\",<ref name=nirenberg>David Nirenberg, ''Communities of Violence'', 1998, {{ISBN|0-691-05889-X}}.</ref> lepers<ref name=nirenberg/><ref>R.I. Moore ''The Formation of a Persecuting Society'', Oxford, 1987 {{ISBN|0-631-17145-2}}</ref> and [[Romani people|Romani]], thinking that they were to blame for the crisis.\n\nDifferences in cultural and lifestyle practices also led to persecution. As the plague swept across Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than half the population, Jews were taken as [[scapegoat#Political/sociological scapegoating|scapegoats]], in part because better hygiene among Jewish communities and isolation in the ghettos meant that Jews were less affected.<ref>Naomi E. Pasachoff, Robert J. Littman ''A Concise History of the Jewish People'' 2005. p. 154 \"However, Jews regularly ritually washed and bathed, and their abodes were slightly cleaner than their Christian neighbors'.

Levy ''Antisemitism'' 2005 p. 763 \"Panic emerged again during the scourge of the Black Death in 1348, when widespread terror prompted a revival of the well poisoning charge. In areas where Jews appeared to die of the plague in fewer numbers than Christians, possibly because of better hygiene and greater isolation, lower mortality rates provided evidence of Jewish guilt.\"</ref> European mobs attacked Jewish settlements across Europe; by 1351, 60 major and 150 smaller Jewish communities had been destroyed, and more than 350 separate massacres had occurred.\n\nAccording to Joseph P. Byrne, women also faced persecution during the Black Death. Muslim women in [[Cairo]] became scapegoats when the plague struck.<ref name=byrne>Joseph P. Byrne, ''The Black Death'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2004), 108.</ref> Byrne writes that in 1438, the sultan of Cairo was informed by his religious lawyers that the arrival of the plague was Allah's punishment for the sin of [[fornication]] and that in accordance with this theory, a law was set in place stating that women were not allowed to make public appearances as they may tempt men into sin. Byrne describes that this law was only lifted when \"the wealthy complained that their female servants could not shop for food.\"<ref name=byrne/>\n\n===Religion===\n\nThe Black Death hit the [[monastery|monasteries]] very hard because of their proximity with the sick who sought refuge there. This left a severe shortage of clergy after the epidemic cycle. Eventually the losses were replaced by hastily trained and inexperienced clergy members, many of whom knew little of the rigors of their predecessors. New colleges were opened at established universities, and the training process sped up.<ref>Steven A. Epstein, ''An Economic and Social History of Later Medieval Europe, 1000\u20131500'' (2009) p. 182</ref> The shortage of priests opened new opportunities for laywomen to assume more extensive and more important service roles in the local parish.<ref>Katherine L. French, ''The Good Women of the Parish: Gender and Religion After the Black Death'' (U of Pennsylvania Press, 2011)</ref>\n\n[[File:Flagellants.png|thumb|Woodcut of flagellants ([[Nuremberg Chronicle]], 1493)]]\n[[Flagellants]] practiced self-flogging (whipping of oneself) to atone for sins. The movement became popular after the Black Death. It may be that the flagellants' later involvement in hedonism was an effort to accelerate or absorb God's wrath, to shorten the time with which others suffered. More likely, the focus of attention and popularity of their cause contributed to a sense that the world itself was ending and that their individual actions were of no consequence.\n\nReformers rarely pointed to failures on the part of the Church in dealing with the catastrophe.<ref>Epstein, p. 182</ref>\n\n==Cultural effect==\n{{Main|Black Death in medieval culture}}\n[[File:Trionfo della morte, gi\u00e0 a palazzo sclafani, galleria regionale di Palazzo Abbatellis, palermo (1446) , affresco staccato.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Triumph of Death (Palermo)|The Triumph of Death]]'' (1446)]]\n\nThe Black Death had a profound effect on art and literature. After 1350, [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] in general turned very morbid. The general mood was one of pessimism, and contemporary art turned dark with representations of death. The widespread image of the \"dance of death\" showed death (a skeleton) choosing victims at random. Many of the most graphic depictions come from writers such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]].<ref>J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 372.</ref> [[Peire Lunel de Montech]], writing about 1348 in the [[lyric poetry|lyric style]] long out of fashion, composed the following sorrowful ''[[sirventes]]'' \"Meravilhar no\u00b7s devo pas las gens\" during the height of the plague in [[Toulouse]]:\n\n{{quote|They died by the hundreds, both day and night, and all were thrown in ... ditches and covered with earth.

The condition of the people was pitiable to behold. They sickened by the thousands daily, and died unattended and without help. Many died in the open street, others dying in their houses, made it known by the stench of their rotting bodies. Consecrated churchyards did not suffice for the burial of the vast multitude of bodies, which were heaped by the hundreds in vast trenches, like goods in a ship's hold and covered with a little earth.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spignesi |first1=Stephen |title=Catastrophe!: The 100 Greatest Disasters of All Time |date=2002 |publisher=Kensington Publishing Corp |location=New York |page=1}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Dance of Death (CCLXIIIIv).jpg|thumb|right| ''[[Danse Macabre]]'' from the Nuremberg Chronicle (1493).]]\n\n===Medicine===\n\nAlthough the Black Death highlighted the shortcomings of medical science in the medieval era, it also led to positive changes in the field of medicine. As described by David Herlihy in ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West,'' more emphasis was placed on \"anatomical investigations\" following the Black Death.<ref name=herlihy>David Herlihy, ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1997), 72.</ref> How individuals studied the human body notably changed, becoming a process that dealt more directly with the human body in varied states of sickness and health. Further, at this time, the importance of surgeons became more evident.<ref name=herlihy/>\n\nA theory put forth by Stephen O'Brien says the Black Death is likely responsible, through [[natural selection]], for the high frequency of the [[CCR5|CCR5-\u039432]] genetic defect in people of European descent. The gene affects [[T cell]] function and provides protection against [[HIV]], [[smallpox]], and possibly plague,<ref>{{cite journal | last1= Jefferys | first1= Richard | author2= Anne-christine d'Adesky | title = Designer Genes | journal = [[LPI Media#HIV Plus|HIV Plus]] | date=March 1999 | url = http://www.aidsinfonyc.org/hivplus/issue3/ahead/genes.html | accessdate = 2006-12-12 |issn=1522-3086 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214110211/http://www.aidsinfonyc.org/hivplus/issue3/ahead/genes.html |archivedate=14 February 2008 | issue=3}}</ref> though for the last, no explanation as to how it would do that exists.

The basic Gothic style was revamped with elaborate decoration in the late medieval period. Sculptors in Italian city-states emulated the work of their Roman forefathers while sculptors in northern Europe, no doubt inspired by the devastation they had witnessed, gave way to a heightened expression of emotion and an emphasis on individual differences.<ref>Bennett and Hollister, p. 375.</ref> A tough realism came forth in architecture as in literature. Images of intense sorrow, decaying corpses, and individuals with faults as well as virtues emerged. North of the Alps, painting reached a pinnacle of precise realism with [[Early Dutch painting]] by artists such as [[Jan van Eyck]] (c. 1390\u2013by 1441). The natural world was reproduced in these works with meticulous detail whose realism was not unlike photography.<ref>Bennett and Hollister, p. 376.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n[[Depopulation#Economic Consequences]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{ibid|date=March 2018}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n{{col-begin|2}}\n{{col-break}}\n* Aberth, John, ed.

German colonial forces withdrew from the capital [[Lom\u00e9]] and the coastal province, to fight delaying actions on the route north to [[Kamina, Togo|Kamina]], where the [[Kamina Funkstation, Togo|''Kamina Funkstation'']] (wireless transmitter) linked the government in Berlin to Togoland, the Atlantic and South America. The main British and French force from the neighbouring colonies of [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] and [[Dahomey]], advanced from the coast up the road and railway, as smaller forces converged on Kamina from the north. The German defenders were able to delay the invaders for several days at the battles of Agbeluvhoe and Chra but surrendered the colony on 26 August 1914. In 1916, Togoland was partitioned by the victors and in July 1922, [[British Togoland]] and [[French Togoland]] were established as [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]].\n\n== Background ==\n===Togoland, 1914===\nThe [[German Empire]] had established a protectorate over Togoland in 1884, which was slightly larger than Ireland and had a population of about one million people in 1914.

South of the high ground the ground rises from coastal marshes and lagoons to a plateau about {{convert|200|\u2013|300|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, covered in forest, high grass and scrub, where farmers had cleared the forest for palm oil cultivation. The climate was tropical, with more rainfall in the interior and a dry season in August.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=6}} Half of the border with Gold Coast ran along the Volta river and a tributary but in the south, the border for {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=on}} was beyond the east bank. The Germans had made the southern region one of the most developed colonies in Africa, having built three metre-gauge railway lines and several roads from [[Lom\u00e9]] the capital and main city. There was no port and ships had to lie off Lom\u00e9 and transfer freight via [[surfboat]]. One line ran along the coast from Anekho to Lom\u00e9, one ran from Lom\u00e9 to Atakpame and one from Lom\u00e9 to Palime. Roads had been built from Lom\u00e9 to Atakpame and Sokode, Palime to Kete Krachi and from Kete Krachi to Sansame Mangu; in 1914 the roads were reported to be fit for motor vehicles.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=4\u20135}}\n\nGerman military forces in Togoland were exiguous, there were no German army units in Togoland, only {{nowrap|693 [[Schutztruppe|''Polizeitruppen'']]}} (paramilitary police) under the command of Captain Georg Pf\u00e4hler and about {{nowrap|300 colonists}} with military training.{{sfn|Strachan|2004|p=14}} The colony was adjacent to [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] territory, with [[French Dahomey]] on its northern and eastern borders and the [[British Gold Coast]] to the west. Lom\u00e9 and the wireless station at Kamina about {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} inland, which was connected to the coast by road and rail, were the only places of military significance. Kamina was near the town of [[Atakpame]] and had been completed in June 1914. The transmitter was a relay station for communication between Germany, the overseas colonies, the [[Imperial German Navy]] and South America.{{sfn|Killingray|2012|p=116}} The [[Admiralty]] wished to prevent the station from being used to co-ordinate attacks on shipping in the Atlantic. At the outbreak of war the Governor of Togoland, [[Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg]] was in Germany and his deputy, Major Hans-Major Georg von D\u00f6ring was the acting-Governor.{{sfn|Strachan|2004|p=14}}\n\n===Gold Coast, 1914===\n[[File:West Africa 1914-1918.jpg|thumb|{{centre|West Africa, 1914\u20131918}}]]\nSir [[Hugh Clifford]], the Governor of the Gold Coast, Lieutenant-General [[Charles Macpherson Dobell]], commander of the [[Royal West African Frontier Force|West African Frontier Force]] (WAFF) and Lieutenant-Colonel R. A. de B. Rose, commander of the [[Gold Coast Regiment]] were absent during July 1914. W. C. F. Robertson was the acting-Governor and Captain Frederick Bryant was acting-Commandant of the Gold Coast Regiment.{{sfn|Strachan|2004|p=14}} The Gold Coast Regiment had one pioneer company, seven infantry companies with a machine-gun each, and a battery of four [[QF 2.95-inch Mountain Gun]]s, amounting to {{nowrap|1,595 men}} including {{nowrap|124 carriers}} and about 330 reservists. There were four \"Volunteer Corps\" with about 900 men and {{nowrap|1,200 police}} and customs officers. The Defence Scheme for the Gold Coast (1913) provided for war against the French in neighbouring Ivory Coast and the Germans in Togoland; in the event of war with Germany, the colony was to be defended along [[Lake Volta]] and the north-eastern frontier against the possibility of a raid, which was the most that the Germans in Togoland were thought capable of.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=9}}\n\nThe plan also provided for an offensive across the lake into the north of Togoland, before making a thrust south to the more populated portion of the colony. On 29 July, a Colonial Office telegram arrived at Accra, ordering the adoption of the ''precautionary stage'' of the Defence Scheme and Robertson forwarded the information to Bryant the next day.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=11}} Bryant dispensed with the Scheme, which had not been revised after the wireless station at Kamina was built and by 31 July, had mobilised the Gold Coast Regiment along the southern, rather than the northern border with Togoland.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=9\u201310, 13}} In London on 3 August, Dobell proposed an advance if war was declared, along the coast road from Ada to Keta and thence to Lom\u00e9, which was fewer than {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the border. Bryant had reached the same conclusion as Dobell and had already organised small expeditionary columns at Krachi and Ada and assembled the main force at Kumasi, ready to move in either direction.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=13\u201314}}\n\n==Prelude==\n===Anglo-French offensive preparations===\n\n[[File:M 46&47 13 troupes anglaises au Togo.jpg|thumb|{{centre|British troops on parade in Togoland, 1914}}]]\nOn 5 August 1914, a day after Britain declared war on Germany, the Allies cut the German sea cables between Monrovia and Tenerife, leaving the radio station at Kamina the only connexion between the colony and Germany.{{sfn|Friedenwald|2001|p=11}} The same day the acting-Governor of Togoland, D\u00f6ring sent a telegram to Robertson proposing neutrality, in accordance with articles X and XI of the [[Berlin Conference|Congo Act]], which stated that colonies in the [[Congo Basin]] were to remain neutral in the event of a conflict in Europe.{{sfn|Chappell|2005|p=7}} D\u00f6ring also appealed for neutrality because of the economic interdependence of the West African colonies and their common interest in dominating local populations.{{sfn|Strachan|2004|p=15}} On 6 August, the Cabinet in London refused the offer of neutrality and Bryant on his own initiative, after hearing that the French in Dahomey wished to co-operate, sent Captain Barker and the District Commissioner of Keta to D\u00f6ring, with a demand the surrender of the colony and gave {{nowrap|24-hours}} to reply. The next morning the British intercepted a wireless message from D\u00f6ring that he was withdrawing from the coast to Kamina and that Lom\u00e9 would be surrendered if attacked.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=17\u201319}} A similar proposal for neutrality from D\u00f6ring had been received by the Governor of Dahomey, who took it for a declaration of war and ordered an invasion. A French contingency plan to seize Lom\u00e9 and the coast had been drafted in ignorance of the wireless station at Kamina, only {{convert|60|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} from the Dahomey border.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=21}}\n\n== Invasion ==\n=== Capture of Lom\u00e9 ===\nLate on 6 August, French police occupied customs posts near Athieme and next day Major Maroix, the commander of French military forces in Dahomey, ordered the capture of Agbanake and [[An\u00e9ho|Aneho]]. Agbanake was occupied late on 7 August, the Mono River was crossed and a column under Captain Marchand took Aneho early on 8 August; both moves were unopposed and local civilians helped to see off the Germans, by burning down the Government House at Sebe. The ~460 colonists and [[Askaris]] retreated inland, impressing civilians and calling up reservists as they moved north.{{sfn|Friedenwald|2001|p=11}} Repairs began on the Aneho\u2013Lom\u00e9 railway and the French advanced to Porto Seguro and Togo before stopping the advance, once it was clear that Lom\u00e9 had been surrendered to British forces.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=21\u201322}} The British invasion began late on 7 August, the British emissaries returned to Lom\u00e9 by lorry, to find that the Germans had left for Kamina and given Herr Clausnitzer discretion to surrender the colony up to Chra, {{convert|120|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} inland, to prevent a naval bombardment of Lom\u00e9. On 8 August, the emissaries took command of fourteen British soldiers and police from Aflao; a telegraph operator arrived by bicycle and repaired the line to Keta and Accra.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nThe British flag was raised and on 9 August, parties of troops arrived having marched {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} in exhausting heat.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=21\u201322}} Over the border, Bryant had arranged to move the main force by sea and embarked on the ''Elele'' on 10 August. Three other companies had been ordered to Krachi, to begin a land advance to Kamina. The ''Elele'' arrived off Lom\u00e9 on 12 August and the force disembarked through the surf.{{efn|A British patrol near a factory in [[Nots\u00e9|Nuatja]], came into contact with German police and exchanged fire. Private [[Alhaji Grunshi]] (who retired after the war as a Regimental Sergeant-Major) is believed to be the first British soldier to fire a rifle in anger in the First World War.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=8}}}} Arrangements were made with the French, for a converging advance towards Atakpame by the British and the French from Aneho, a French column under Maroix from [[Tchetti]] in the north and the British column at Krachi under Captain Elgee. Small British forces on the northern border, were put under the command of Maroix and ordered to move south, as ~560 French cavalry were ordered across the northern border from Senegal and Niger, towards Sansane Mangu from {{nowrap|13\u201315 August.}} The British force at Lom\u00e9 comprised {{nowrap|558 soldiers,}} {{nowrap|2,084 carriers,}} police and volunteers, who were preparing to advance inland, when Bryant received news of a German foray to Togblekove.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=25\u201327}}\n\n=== Advance to Kamina ===\n\n{{Main|Battle of Agbeluvhoe}}\n\n[[File:Transmitter mast kamina togo.jpg|thumb|{{centre|An aerial mast at the ''Kamina Funkstation'', (wireless transmitter)}}]]\nThe Battle of Bafilo was a skirmish between [[French Third Republic|French]] and German troops in north-east [[Togoland]] on 13 August. French forces had crossed the border between [[Dahomey|French Dahomey]] and Togoland on {{nowrap|8\u20139 August.}} The French were engaged by German troops in the districts of Sansane-Mangu and Skode-Balfilo. The French company retreated, after facing greater resistance than expected.{{sfn|Schreckenbach|1920|p=886}} After the capture of Lom\u00e9 on the coast, Bryant was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel, made commander of all Allied forces in the operation and landed at Lom\u00e9 on 12 August, with the main British force of {{nowrap|558 soldiers,}} {{nowrap|2,084 carriers,}} police and volunteers. As preparations began to advance northwards to Kamina, Bryant heard that a German party had travelled south by train the day before. The party had destroyed a small wireless transmitter and railway bridge at Togblekove, about {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the north. Bryant detached half an infantry company on 12 August and sent another {{frac|1|1|2}} companies forward the next day, to prevent further attacks.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nBy the evening, \"I\" Company had reached Tsevie, scouts reported that the country south of Agbeluvhoe was clear of German troops and the main force had reached Togblekove; at {{nowrap|10:00 p.m.}} \"I\" Company began to advance up the road to Agbeluvhoe. The relatively harsh terrain of bushland and swamp impeded the Allied push to Kamina, by keeping the invaders on the railway and the road, which had fallen into disrepair and was impassable by wheeled vehicles. Communication between the parties was difficult, because of the intervening high grass and thick scrub. The main force moved on from Togblekove at {{nowrap|6:00 a.m.}} on 15 August and at {{nowrap|8:30 a.m.,}} local civilians told Bryant that a train full of Germans had steamed into Tsevie that morning and shot up the station.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=26\u201328}} In the afternoon the British advanced guard met German troops near the Lili river, who blew the bridge and dug in on a ridge on the far side.{{efn|British engineers were quick to build replacement bridges.{{sfn|Morlang|2008|p=36}}}}\n\nThe demolitions and the delaying action, held up the advance until {{nowrap|4:30 p.m.}} and the force spent the night at Ekuni rather than joining \"I\" Company as intended.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=28\u201329}} D\u00f6ring had sent two raiding parties with {{nowrap|200 men}} south in trains, to delay the advancing Allied force.{{sfn|Fecitte|2012|nopp=y}} \"I\" Company had heard the train run south at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.,}} while halted on the road near Ekuni, a village about {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Agbeluvhoe. A section was sent to cut off the train and the rest of \"I\" Company pressed on to Agbeluvhoe. A local civilian guided the section to the railway, where Lieutenant Collins and his men piled stones and a heavy iron plate on the tracks, about {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} north of the bridge at Ekuni and then set an ambush. One of the trains of {{nowrap|20 cars}} was derailed by the obstacles placed on the tracks and the other train was halted by the rest of \"I\" Company at the [[Battle of Agbeluvhoe]]. In the fight between German troops in the railway carriages and the British, the Germans were defeated, Pf\u00e4hler was killed and a quarter of the German force became casualties.{{sfn|Friedenwald|2001|p=12}}{{sfn|Strachan|2004|p=17}}\n\n=== Battle of Chra, 22 August ===\n{{main|Battle of Chra}}\nDespite the skirmish in the north-west at Bafilo and the action at Agbeluvhoe, Allied forces advancing towards the German base at Kamina had not encountered substantial resistance. The last natural barrier south of Kamina was the Chra River, where D\u00f6ring chose to make a stand. The railway bridge over the river was destroyed and the approaches to the river and village were mined. On 21 August, British scouts found {{nowrap|460\u2013560 German}} police troops entrenched on the north bank of the river.{{sfn|Friedenwald|2001|p=12}} The West African Rifles, supported by French forces from the east, assembled on the south bank and during 22 August Bryant ordered attacks on the German entrenchments.

The Germans had withdrawn to the wireless station and during the night of {{nowrap|24/25 August,}} explosions were heard from the direction of Kamina. French and British forces arrived at Kamina on 26 August, to find that the nine radio towers had been demolished and the electrical equipment destroyed. D\u00f6ring and {{nowrap|200 remaining}} troops surrendered the colony to Bryant; the rest of the German force had deserted.{{sfn|Friedenwald|2001|p=12}} The Allied troops recovered three [[Maxim gun|Maxim]] machine-guns, {{nowrap|1,000 rifles}} and about 320,000 rounds of ammunition.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=39}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n===Analysis===\n[[File:Togoland.svg|lang=en|thumb|{{centre|Partition of German Togoland between Britain (green) and France (purple)}}]]\nBefore the wireless station at Kamina was destroyed, {{nowrap|229 messages}} were passed between Germany, the navy and colonies following the outbreak of war.{{sfn|Strachan|2004|p=17}} The first military operations of British soldiers during the First World War occurred in Togoland and ended soon after British operations began in continental Europe.{{sfn|Andrew|Kanya-Forstner|1981|p=61}} In December 1916, the colony was split into British and French occupation zones, which cut through administrative divisions and civilian boundaries.{{sfn|Louis|2006|p=217}} Both powers sought a new partition and in 1919, Article 22 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] partitioned former German colonies between the Allies.{{sfn|Strandman|1967|p=9}} In July 1922, [[British Togoland]] and [[French Togoland]] were created from former German Togoland, as [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]].{{sfn|Gorman|Newman|2009|p=629}} The French acquisition consisted of about sixty percent of the colony, including the coast.

German colonial forces withdrew from the capital [[Lom\u00e9]] and the coastal province, to fight delaying actions on the route north to [[Kamina, Togo|Kamina]], where the [[Kamina Funkstation, Togo|''Kamina Funkstation'']] (wireless transmitter) linked the government in Berlin to Togoland, the Atlantic and South America. The main British and French force from the neighbouring colonies of [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] and [[Dahomey]], advanced from the coast up the road and railway, as smaller forces converged on Kamina from the north. The German defenders were able to delay the invaders for several days at the battles of Agbeluvhoe and Chra but surrendered the colony on 26 August 1914. In 1916, Togoland was partitioned by the victors and in July 1922, [[British Togoland]] and [[French Togoland]] were established as [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]].\n\n== Background ==\n===Togoland, 1914===\nThe [[German Empire]] had established a protectorate over Togoland in 1884, which was slightly larger than Ireland and had a population of about one million people in 1914. A mountain range with heights of over {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}} ran south-east to north-west and restricted traffic between the coast and hinterland. South of the high ground the ground rises from coastal marshes and lagoons to a plateau about {{convert|200|\u2013|300|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, covered in forest, high grass and scrub, where farmers had cleared the forest for palm oil cultivation. The climate was tropical, with more rainfall in the interior and a dry season in August.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=6}} Half of the border with Gold Coast ran along the Volta river and a tributary but in the south, the border for {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=on}} was beyond the east bank. The Germans had made the southern region one of the most developed colonies in Africa, having built three metre-gauge railway lines and several roads from [[Lom\u00e9]] the capital and main city. There was no port and ships had to lie off Lom\u00e9 and transfer freight via [[surfboat]]. One line ran along the coast from Anekho to Lom\u00e9, one ran from Lom\u00e9 to Atakpame and one from Lom\u00e9 to Palime. Roads had been built from Lom\u00e9 to Atakpame and Sokode, Palime to Kete Krachi and from Kete Krachi to Sansame Mangu; in 1914 the roads were reported to be fit for motor vehicles.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=4\u20135}}\n\nGerman military forces in Togoland were exiguous, there were no German army units in Togoland, only {{nowrap|693 [[Schutztruppe|''Polizeitruppen'']]}} (paramilitary police) under the command of Captain Georg Pf\u00e4hler and about {{nowrap|300 colonists}} with military training.{{sfn|Strachan|2004|p=14}} The colony was adjacent to [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] territory, with [[French Dahomey]] on its northern and eastern borders and the [[British Gold Coast]] to the west. Lom\u00e9 and the wireless station at Kamina about {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} inland, which was connected to the coast by road and rail, were the only places of military significance. Kamina was near the town of [[Atakpame]] and had been completed in June 1914. The transmitter was a relay station for communication between Germany, the overseas colonies, the [[Imperial German Navy]] and South America.{{sfn|Killingray|2012|p=116}} The [[Admiralty]] wished to prevent the station from being used to co-ordinate attacks on shipping in the Atlantic. At the outbreak of war the Governor of Togoland, [[Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg]] was in Germany and his deputy, Major Hans-Major Georg von D\u00f6ring was the acting-Governor.{{sfn|Strachan|2004|p=14}}\n\n===Gold Coast, 1914===\n[[File:West Africa 1914-1918.jpg|thumb|{{centre|West Africa, 1914\u20131918}}]]\nSir [[Hugh Clifford]], the Governor of the Gold Coast, Lieutenant-General [[Charles Macpherson Dobell]], commander of the [[Royal West African Frontier Force|West African Frontier Force]] (WAFF) and Lieutenant-Colonel R. A. de B. Rose, commander of the [[Gold Coast Regiment]] were absent during July 1914. W. C. F. Robertson was the acting-Governor and Captain Frederick Bryant was acting-Commandant of the Gold Coast Regiment.{{sfn|Strachan|2004|p=14}} The Gold Coast Regiment had one pioneer company, seven infantry companies with a machine-gun each, and a battery of four [[QF 2.95-inch Mountain Gun]]s, amounting to {{nowrap|1,595 men}} including {{nowrap|124 carriers}} and about 330 reservists. There were four \"Volunteer Corps\" with about 900 men and {{nowrap|1,200 police}} and customs officers. The Defence Scheme for the Gold Coast (1913) provided for war against the French in neighbouring Ivory Coast and the Germans in Togoland; in the event of war with Germany, the colony was to be defended along [[Lake Volta]] and the north-eastern frontier against the possibility of a raid, which was the most that the Germans in Togoland were thought capable of.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=9}}\n\nThe plan also provided for an offensive across the lake into the north of Togoland, before making a thrust south to the more populated portion of the colony. On 29 July, a Colonial Office telegram arrived at Accra, ordering the adoption of the ''precautionary stage'' of the Defence Scheme and Robertson forwarded the information to Bryant the next day.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=11}} Bryant dispensed with the Scheme, which had not been revised after the wireless station at Kamina was built and by 31 July, had mobilised the Gold Coast Regiment along the southern, rather than the northern border with Togoland.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=9\u201310, 13}} In London on 3 August, Dobell proposed an advance if war was declared, along the coast road from Ada to Keta and thence to Lom\u00e9, which was fewer than {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the border. Bryant had reached the same conclusion as Dobell and had already organised small expeditionary columns at Krachi and Ada and assembled the main force at Kumasi, ready to move in either direction.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=13\u201314}}\n\n==Prelude==\n===Anglo-French offensive preparations===\n\n[[File:M 46&47 13 troupes anglaises au Togo.jpg|thumb|{{centre|British troops on parade in Togoland, 1914}}]]\nOn 5 August 1914, a day after Britain declared war on Germany, the Allies cut the German sea cables between Monrovia and Tenerife, leaving the radio station at Kamina the only connexion between the colony and Germany.{{sfn|Friedenwald|2001|p=11}} The same day the acting-Governor of Togoland, D\u00f6ring sent a telegram to Robertson proposing neutrality, in accordance with articles X and XI of the [[Berlin Conference|Congo Act]], which stated that colonies in the [[Congo Basin]] were to remain neutral in the event of a conflict in Europe.{{sfn|Chappell|2005|p=7}} D\u00f6ring also appealed for neutrality because of the economic interdependence of the West African colonies and their common interest in dominating local populations.{{sfn|Strachan|2004|p=15}} On 6 August, the Cabinet in London refused the offer of neutrality and Bryant on his own initiative, after hearing that the French in Dahomey wished to co-operate, sent Captain Barker and the District Commissioner of Keta to D\u00f6ring, with a demand the surrender of the colony and gave {{nowrap|24-hours}} to reply. The next morning the British intercepted a wireless message from D\u00f6ring that he was withdrawing from the coast to Kamina and that Lom\u00e9 would be surrendered if attacked.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=17\u201319}} A similar proposal for neutrality from D\u00f6ring had been received by the Governor of Dahomey, who took it for a declaration of war and ordered an invasion. A French contingency plan to seize Lom\u00e9 and the coast had been drafted in ignorance of the wireless station at Kamina, only {{convert|60|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} from the Dahomey border.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=21}}\n\n== Invasion ==\n=== Capture of Lom\u00e9 ===\nLate on 6 August, French police occupied customs posts near Athieme and next day Major Maroix, the commander of French military forces in Dahomey, ordered the capture of Agbanake and [[An\u00e9ho|Aneho]]. Agbanake was occupied late on 7 August, the Mono River was crossed and a column under Captain Marchand took Aneho early on 8 August; both moves were unopposed and local civilians helped to see off the Germans, by burning down the Government House at Sebe. The ~460 colonists and [[Askaris]] retreated inland, impressing civilians and calling up reservists as they moved north.{{sfn|Friedenwald|2001|p=11}} Repairs began on the Aneho\u2013Lom\u00e9 railway and the French advanced to Porto Seguro and Togo before stopping the advance, once it was clear that Lom\u00e9 had been surrendered to British forces.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=21\u201322}} The British invasion began late on 7 August, the British emissaries returned to Lom\u00e9 by lorry, to find that the Germans had left for Kamina and given Herr Clausnitzer discretion to surrender the colony up to Chra, {{convert|120|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} inland, to prevent a naval bombardment of Lom\u00e9. On 8 August, the emissaries took command of fourteen British soldiers and police from Aflao; a telegraph operator arrived by bicycle and repaired the line to Keta and Accra.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nThe British flag was raised and on 9 August, parties of troops arrived having marched {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} in exhausting heat.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=21\u201322}} Over the border, Bryant had arranged to move the main force by sea and embarked on the ''Elele'' on 10 August. Three other companies had been ordered to Krachi, to begin a land advance to Kamina. The ''Elele'' arrived off Lom\u00e9 on 12 August and the force disembarked through the surf.{{efn|A British patrol near a factory in [[Nots\u00e9|Nuatja]], came into contact with German police and exchanged fire. Private [[Alhaji Grunshi]] (who retired after the war as a Regimental Sergeant-Major) is believed to be the first British soldier to fire a rifle in anger in the First World War.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=8}}}} Arrangements were made with the French, for a converging advance towards Atakpame by the British and the French from Aneho, a French column under Maroix from [[Tchetti]] in the north and the British column at Krachi under Captain Elgee. Small British forces on the northern border, were put under the command of Maroix and ordered to move south, as ~560 French cavalry were ordered across the northern border from Senegal and Niger, towards Sansane Mangu from {{nowrap|13\u201315 August.}} The British force at Lom\u00e9 comprised {{nowrap|558 soldiers,}} {{nowrap|2,084 carriers,}} police and volunteers, who were preparing to advance inland, when Bryant received news of a German foray to Togblekove.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=25\u201327}}\n\n=== Advance to Kamina ===\n\n{{Main|Battle of Agbeluvhoe}}\n\n[[File:Transmitter mast kamina togo.jpg|thumb|{{centre|An aerial mast at the ''Kamina Funkstation'', (wireless transmitter)}}]]\nThe Battle of Bafilo was a skirmish between [[French Third Republic|French]] and German troops in north-east [[Togoland]] on 13 August. French forces had crossed the border between [[Dahomey|French Dahomey]] and Togoland on {{nowrap|8\u20139 August.}} The French were engaged by German troops in the districts of Sansane-Mangu and Skode-Balfilo. The French company retreated, after facing greater resistance than expected.{{sfn|Schreckenbach|1920|p=886}} After the capture of Lom\u00e9 on the coast, Bryant was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel, made commander of all Allied forces in the operation and landed at Lom\u00e9 on 12 August, with the main British force of {{nowrap|558 soldiers,}} {{nowrap|2,084 carriers,}} police and volunteers. As preparations began to advance northwards to Kamina, Bryant heard that a German party had travelled south by train the day before. The party had destroyed a small wireless transmitter and railway bridge at Togblekove, about {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the north. Bryant detached half an infantry company on 12 August and sent another {{frac|1|1|2}} companies forward the next day, to prevent further attacks.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nBy the evening, \"I\" Company had reached Tsevie, scouts reported that the country south of Agbeluvhoe was clear of German troops and the main force had reached Togblekove; at {{nowrap|10:00 p.m.}} \"I\" Company began to advance up the road to Agbeluvhoe. The relatively harsh terrain of bushland and swamp impeded the Allied push to Kamina, by keeping the invaders on the railway and the road, which had fallen into disrepair and was impassable by wheeled vehicles. Communication between the parties was difficult, because of the intervening high grass and thick scrub. The main force moved on from Togblekove at {{nowrap|6:00 a.m.}} on 15 August and at {{nowrap|8:30 a.m.,}} local civilians told Bryant that a train full of Germans had steamed into Tsevie that morning and shot up the station.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=26\u201328}} In the afternoon the British advanced guard met German troops near the Lili river, who blew the bridge and dug in on a ridge on the far side.{{efn|British engineers were quick to build replacement bridges.{{sfn|Morlang|2008|p=36}}}}\n\nThe demolitions and the delaying action, held up the advance until {{nowrap|4:30 p.m.}} and the force spent the night at Ekuni rather than joining \"I\" Company as intended.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|pp=28\u201329}} D\u00f6ring had sent two raiding parties with {{nowrap|200 men}} south in trains, to delay the advancing Allied force.{{sfn|Fecitte|2012|nopp=y}} \"I\" Company had heard the train run south at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.,}} while halted on the road near Ekuni, a village about {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Agbeluvhoe. A section was sent to cut off the train and the rest of \"I\" Company pressed on to Agbeluvhoe. A local civilian guided the section to the railway, where Lieutenant Collins and his men piled stones and a heavy iron plate on the tracks, about {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} north of the bridge at Ekuni and then set an ambush. One of the trains of {{nowrap|20 cars}} was derailed by the obstacles placed on the tracks and the other train was halted by the rest of \"I\" Company at the [[Battle of Agbeluvhoe]]. In the fight between German troops in the railway carriages and the British, the Germans were defeated, Pf\u00e4hler was killed and a quarter of the German force became casualties.{{sfn|Friedenwald|2001|p=12}}{{sfn|Strachan|2004|p=17}}\n\n=== Battle of Chra, 22 August ===\n{{main|Battle of Chra}}\nDespite the skirmish in the north-west at Bafilo and the action at Agbeluvhoe, Allied forces advancing towards the German base at Kamina had not encountered substantial resistance. The last natural barrier south of Kamina was the Chra River, where D\u00f6ring chose to make a stand. The railway bridge over the river was destroyed and the approaches to the river and village were mined. On 21 August, British scouts found {{nowrap|460\u2013560 German}} police troops entrenched on the north bank of the river.{{sfn|Friedenwald|2001|p=12}} The West African Rifles, supported by French forces from the east, assembled on the south bank and during 22 August Bryant ordered attacks on the German entrenchments. The British forces were repulsed and suffered {{nowrap|17 percent casualties.}}{{sfn|Morlang|2008|p=36}}{{sfn|Strachan|2004|p=16}} Lieutenant George Thompson became the first British officer to be killed in action in the First World War.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=36}}\n\nAlthough the Germans had repelled the Allied force from an easily supplied, fortified position, French troops were advancing from the north and east towards Kamina unchecked and a British column was advancing on the station from [[Kete Krachi]] in the west.{{sfn|Strachan|2004|p=17}} On the morning of 23 August, the British found that the German trenches had been abandoned. The Germans had withdrawn to the wireless station and during the night of {{nowrap|24/25 August,}} explosions were heard from the direction of Kamina. French and British forces arrived at Kamina on 26 August, to find that the nine radio towers had been demolished and the electrical equipment destroyed. D\u00f6ring and {{nowrap|200 remaining}} troops surrendered the colony to Bryant; the rest of the German force had deserted.{{sfn|Friedenwald|2001|p=12}} The Allied troops recovered three [[Maxim gun|Maxim]] machine-guns, {{nowrap|1,000 rifles}} and about 320,000 rounds of ammunition.{{sfn|Moberly|1995|p=39}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n===Analysis===\n[[File:Togoland.svg|lang=en|thumb|{{centre|Partition of German Togoland between Britain (green) and France (purple)}}]]\nBefore the wireless station at Kamina was destroyed, {{nowrap|229 messages}} were passed between Germany, the navy and colonies following the outbreak of war.{{sfn|Strachan|2004|p=17}} The first military operations of British soldiers during the First World War occurred in Togoland and ended soon after British operations began in continental Europe.{{sfn|Andrew|Kanya-Forstner|1981|p=61}} In December 1916, the colony was split into British and French occupation zones, which cut through administrative divisions and civilian boundaries.{{sfn|Louis|2006|p=217}} Both powers sought a new partition and in 1919, Article 22 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] partitioned former German colonies between the Allies.{{sfn|Strandman|1967|p=9}} In July 1922, [[British Togoland]] and [[French Togoland]] were created from former German Togoland, as [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]].{{sfn|Gorman|Newman|2009|p=629}} The French acquisition consisted of about sixty percent of the colony, including the coast.

First a [[Kohen|priest]] and then a [[Levite]] comes by, but both avoid the man. Finally, a [[Samaritan]] happens upon the traveller. Samaritans and Jews despised each other, but the Samaritan helps the injured man. [[Jesus]] is described as telling the [[parable]] in response to the question from a lawyer, \"And who is my neighbour?\". In response, Jesus tells the parable, the conclusion of which is that the neighbour figure in the parable is the man who shows mercy to the injured man\u2014that is, the Samaritan.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Exposition of the Old Testament|last=Gill|first=John|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-0801037566|location=|date=1980|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSome Christians, such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], have interpreted the parable allegorically, with the Samaritan representing Jesus Christ, who saves the sinful soul.<ref name=\"Caird, G.

In the same way a [[Levite]] also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain [[Samaritan]], as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on  oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two [[denarii]], gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.'

We rented a car and drove from Jerusalem down to Jericho. And as soon as we got on that road, I said to my wife, \"I can see why Jesus used this as the setting for his parable.\" It's a winding, meandering road. It's really conducive for ambushing. You start out in Jerusalem, which is about 1200 miles -- or rather 1200 feet above sea level. And by the time you get down to Jericho, fifteen or twenty minutes later, you're about 2200 feet below sea level.

Today, the story is often recast in a more modern setting where the people are ones in equivalent social groups known not to interact comfortably. Thus, cast appropriately, the parable regains its message to modern listeners: namely, that an individual of a social group they disapprove of can exhibit moral behavior that is superior to individuals of the groups they approve. Christians have used it as an example of Christianity's opposition to racial, ethnic, and sectarian prejudice.<ref>''Karl Barth's theological exegesis'' by Richard E.

According to them, under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall; from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly extinguished in him; because he is said to be only half-dead. As if it had been the design of Christ, in this passage, to speak of the corruption of human nature, and to inquire whether the wound which Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable; nay, as if he had not plainly, and without a figure, declared in another passage, that all are dead, but those whom he quickens by his voice ({{bibleverse|John|5:25|NIV}}). As little plausibility belongs to another allegory, which, however, has been so highly satisfactory, that it has been admitted by almost universal consent, as if it had been a revelation from heaven. This Samaritan they imagine to be Christ, because he is our guardian; and they tell us that wine was poured, along with oil, into the wound, because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace. They have contrived a third subtlety, that Christ does not immediately restore health, but sends us to the Church, as an innkeeper, to be gradually cured. I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these interpretations; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning. And, indeed, any one may see that the curiosity of certain men has led them to contrive these speculations, contrary to the intention of Christ.<ref name=\"CalvinHarmony\">[[John Calvin]], ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom33.ii.vii.html Commentary on Matthew, Mark, Luke \u2013 Volume 3]''.</ref>}}\n\n[[Francis Schaeffer]] suggested: \"Christians are not to love their believing brothers to the exclusion of their non-believing fellowmen.

Some have suggested that [[religious tolerance]] was an important message of the parable. By selecting for the moral protagonist of the story someone whose religion (Samaritanism) was despised by the Jewish audience to which Jesus was speaking, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay religious differences in favor of focusing on moral character and good works.<ref>{{cite book | author=Smith, John Hunter | title=Greek Testament lessons, consisting chiefly of the Sermon on the mount, and the parables of our Lord.

By contrasting the noble acts of a despised religion to the crass and selfish acts of a priest and a Levite, two representatives of the Jewish religious establishment, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay the importance of status in the religious hierarchy (or importance of knowledge of scripture) in favor of the practice of religious principles.<ref>{{cite book | author=Andrews, Dave | title=Not Religion but Love: Practicing a Radical Spirituality of Compassion | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTxNAwAAQBAJ | publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers | year=2012 | page=117| isbn=9781610978514 }}<br />{{cite book | author=Wilson, Jared C. | title=The Storytelling God: Seeing the Glory of Jesus in His Parables | publisher=Crossway | year=2014 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2pneAgAAQBAJ | page=88| isbn=9781433536717 }}</ref>\n\n====Modern Jewish view====\n''The following is based on the public domain article [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1509&letter=B&search=great%20commandment Brotherly Love] found in the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''\n{{Further|Jewish views on love|Chesed}}\n\nThe story of the good Samaritan, in the Pauline Gospel of Luke x. 25\u201337, related to illustrate the meaning of the word \"neighbor,\" possesses a feature which puzzles the student of rabbinical lore. The kind Samaritan who comes to the rescue of the men that had fallen among the robbers, is contrasted with the unkind priest and Levite; whereas the third class of Jews\u2014i.e., the ordinary Israelites who, as a rule, follow the Cohen and the Levite are omitted; and therefore suspicion is aroused regarding the original form of the story. If \"Samaritan\" has been substituted by the anti-Judean gospel-writer for the original \"Israelite,\" no reflection was intended by Jesus upon Jewish teaching concerning the meaning of neighbor; and the lesson implied is that he who is in need must be the object of our love.\n\nThe term \"neighbor\" has not at all times been thus understood by Jewish teachers.<ref>Several recognize that Lev 19:18  exclusively refers to the Israelitish neighbor (e.g., Stade, \"Gesch. des Volkes Israel,\" i. 510a). This debate is reflected in the question by the Jewish Torah expert re the definition of \"neighbor\" in Lev 19:18 (Luke 10:29).</ref> In Tanna debe Eliyahu R. xv. it is said: \"Blessed be the Lord who is impartial toward all. He says: 'Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor. Thy neighbor is like thy brother, and thy brother is like thy neighbor.'\" Likewise in xxviii.: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\"; that is, thou shalt make the name of God beloved to the creatures by a righteous conduct toward Gentiles as well as Jews (compare Sifre, Deut. 32). Aaron b. Abraham ibn \u1e24ayyim of the sixteenth century, in his commentary to Sifre, l.c.; \u1e24ayyim Vital, the cabalist, in his \"Sha'are \u1e32edushah,\" i. 5; and Moses \u1e24agis of the eighteenth century, in his work on the 613 commandments, while commenting on Deut. xxiii. 7, teach alike that the law of love of the neighbor includes the non-Israelite as well as the Israelite. There is nowhere a dissenting opinion expressed by Jewish writers. For modern times, see among others the conservative opinion of Plessner's religious catechism, \"Dat Mosheh we-Yehudit,\" p.&nbsp;258.\n\nAccordingly, the synod at [[Leipzig]] in 1869, and the German-Israelitish Union of Congregations in 1885, stood on old historical ground when declaring (Lazarus, \"Ethics of Judaism,\" i. 234, 302) that \"'Love thy neighbor as thyself' is a command of all-embracing love, and is a fundamental principle of the Jewish religion\"; and Stade, when charging with imposture the rabbis who made this declaration, is entirely in error (see his \"Geschichte des Volkes Israel,\" l.c.).\n\n=={{anchor|Historical reliability}} Authenticity==\n[[File:Aime-Morot-Le-bon-Samaritain.JPG|thumb|200px|''The Good Samaritan'' by [[Aim\u00e9 Morot]] (1880) shows the Good Samaritan taking the injured man to the inn.]]\n\nThe [[Jesus Seminar]] voted this parable to be authentic,<ref name = \"5GLuke\">[[Robert W.

In the same way a [[Levite]] also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain [[Samaritan]], as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on  oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two [[denarii]], gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.'

Today, the story is often recast in a more modern setting where the people are ones in equivalent social groups known not to interact comfortably. Thus, cast appropriately, the parable regains its message to modern listeners: namely, that an individual of a social group they disapprove of can exhibit moral behavior that is superior to individuals of the groups they approve.

According to them, under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall; from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly extinguished in him; because he is said to be only half-dead. As if it had been the design of Christ, in this passage, to speak of the corruption of human nature, and to inquire whether the wound which Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable; nay, as if he had not plainly, and without a figure, declared in another passage, that all are dead, but those whom he quickens by his voice ({{bibleverse|John|5:25|NIV}}). As little plausibility belongs to another allegory, which, however, has been so highly satisfactory, that it has been admitted by almost universal consent, as if it had been a revelation from heaven. This Samaritan they imagine to be Christ, because he is our guardian; and they tell us that wine was poured, along with oil, into the wound, because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace. They have contrived a third subtlety, that Christ does not immediately restore health, but sends us to the Church, as an innkeeper, to be gradually cured. I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these interpretations; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning.

Some have suggested that [[religious tolerance]] was an important message of the parable.

By contrasting the noble acts of a despised religion to the crass and selfish acts of a priest and a Levite, two representatives of the Jewish religious establishment, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay the importance of status in the religious hierarchy (or importance of knowledge of scripture) in favor of the practice of religious principles.<ref>{{cite book | author=Andrews, Dave | title=Not Religion but Love: Practicing a Radical Spirituality of Compassion | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTxNAwAAQBAJ | publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers | year=2012 | page=117| isbn=9781610978514 }}<br />{{cite book | author=Wilson, Jared C. | title=The Storytelling God: Seeing the Glory of Jesus in His Parables | publisher=Crossway | year=2014 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2pneAgAAQBAJ | page=88| isbn=9781433536717 }}</ref>\n\n====Modern Jewish view====\n''The following is based on the public domain article [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1509&letter=B&search=great%20commandment Brotherly Love] found in the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''\n{{Further|Jewish views on love|Chesed}}\n\nThe story of the good Samaritan, in the Pauline Gospel of Luke x. 25-37, related to illustrate the meaning of the word \"neighbor,\" possesses a feature which puzzles the student of rabbinical lore. The kind Samaritan who comes to the rescue of the men that had fallen among the robbers, is contrasted with the unkind priest and Levite; whereas the third class of Jews\u2014i.e., the ordinary Israelites who, as a rule, follow the Cohen and the Levite are omitted; and therefore suspicion is aroused regarding the original form of the story. If \"Samaritan\" has been substituted by the anti-Judean gospel-writer for the original \"Israelite,\" no reflection was intended by Jesus upon Jewish teaching concerning the meaning of neighbor; and the lesson implied is that he who is in need must be the object of our love.\n\nThe term \"neighbor\" has not at all times been thus understood by Jewish teachers.<ref>Several recognize that Lev 19:18  exclusively refers to the Israelitish neighbor (e.g., Stade, \"Gesch. des Volkes Israel,\" i. 510a). This debate is reflected in the question by the Jewish Torah expert re the definition of \"neighbor\" in Lev 19:18 (Luke 10:29).</ref> In Tanna debe Eliyahu R. xv. it is said: \"Blessed be the Lord who is impartial toward all. He says: 'Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor. Thy neighbor is like thy brother, and thy brother is like thy neighbor.'\" Likewise in xxviii.: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\"; that is, thou shalt make the name of God beloved to the creatures by a righteous conduct toward Gentiles as well as Jews (compare Sifre, Deut. 32). Aaron b. Abraham ibn \u1e24ayyim of the sixteenth century, in his commentary to Sifre, l.c.; \u1e24ayyim Vital, the cabalist, in his \"Sha'are \u1e32edushah,\" i. 5; and Moses \u1e24agis of the eighteenth century, in his work on the 613 commandments, while commenting on Deut. xxiii. 7, teach alike that the law of love of the neighbor includes the non-Israelite as well as the Israelite. There is nowhere a dissenting opinion expressed by Jewish writers. For modern times, see among others the conservative opinion of Plessner's religious catechism, \"Dat Mosheh we-Yehudit,\" p.&nbsp;258.\n\nAccordingly, the synod at [[Leipzig]] in 1869, and the German-Israelitish Union of Congregations in 1885, stood on old historical ground when declaring (Lazarus, \"Ethics of Judaism,\" i. 234, 302) that \"'Love thy neighbor as thyself' is a command of all-embracing love, and is a fundamental principle of the Jewish religion\"; and Stade, when charging with imposture the rabbis who made this declaration, is entirely in error (see his \"Geschichte des Volkes Israel,\" l.c.).\n\n=={{anchor|Historical reliability}} Authenticity==\n[[File:Aime-Morot-Le-bon-Samaritain.JPG|thumb|200px|''The Good Samaritan'' by [[Aim\u00e9 Morot]] (1880) shows the Good Samaritan taking the injured man to the inn.]]\n\nThe [[Jesus Seminar]] voted this parable to be authentic,<ref name = \"5GLuke\">[[Robert W.
