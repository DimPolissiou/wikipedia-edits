The history of the relationship can be traced back to when the [[United States]] first gained independence. The relationship between the two countries have been, until recent years, quite strong, complex, and even somewhat positive in various aspects. Both countries used to have an extremely extensive economic partnership, and the great amount of trade between the two countries necessitated for constructive political relations, but significant issues still exist. The relationship is of economic cooperation, [[hegemony|hegemonic]] rivalry in the Pacific, and mutual suspicion over each other's intentions. Therefore, each nation has adopted a wary attitude regarding the other as a potential adversary but has meanwhile maintained an extremely strong economic partnership.<ref>Woon, C.Y., 2018.

President [[John Tyler]] In 1843 appointed \nMassachusetts diplomat [[Caleb Cushing]] as commissioner and [[United States Ambassador to China|Minister]]. With the goal of impressing the Royal Chinese court, the Cushing mission suddenly appeared with four American warships, loaded with gifts that exalted scientific wonders including revolvers, telescopes, and an encyclopedia. His arrival at Macau in February 1844 created a local sensation, but the Chinese government was reluctant to designate another most favored nation. Cushing cleverly mixed the carrot and stick. He warned \u2013 against the backdrop of his warships \u2013 that not to receive an envoy was a national insult. He threatened to go directly to the Emperor \u2013 an unheard of procedure. The Emperor tried delay, but he finally sent an envoy to negotiate with Cushing, leading to the signing of the [[Treaty of Wanghia]] in the village of Wanghia on July 3, 1844. In addition to most favored nation status, Cushing made sure that Americans received [[extraterritoriality]], which meant that legal cases involving Americans inside China would be tried by Western judges, not by Chinese judges. In the following years American trade with China grew rapidly, thanks to the high-speed clipper ships which carried relatively small amounts of high-value cargo, such as ginseng and silk. American Protestant missionaries also began to arrive.  The popular Chinese reaction was mostly hostile, but there was a favorable element that provided a base of support for American missionaries and businessmen. By 1850-64, China was emeshed in the Taiping rebellion which caused millions of lives, and foreign trade stagnated.<ref>{{cite book |last=Koon|first=Yeewan |editor-last=Johnson |editor-first=Kendall|title=Narratives of Free Trade: The Commercial Cultures of Early US-China Relations|publisher=Hong Kong University Press |date=2012 |pages=131\u2013148 |chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/8340388 |chapter=The Face of Diplomacy in 19th-Century China: Qiying's Portrait Gifts }}</ref><ref>Richard E.

Burlingame toured the country to build support for equitable treatment for China and for Chinese emigrants. The 1868 [[Burlingame Treaty]] embodied these principles. In 1871, the [[Chinese Educational Mission]] brought the first of two groups of 120 Chinese boys to study in the United States. They were led by [[Yung Wing]], the first Chinese man to graduate from an American university.\n\nDuring the [[California Gold Rush]] and the construction of the [[transcontinental railroad]], large numbers of Chinese emigrated to the U.S., spurring animosity from American citizens. After being forcibly driven from the mines, most Chinese settled in [[Chinatown]]s in cities such as [[San Francisco]], taking up low-end wage labor, such as restaurant and cleaning work. With the post-Civil War economy in decline by the 1870s, anti-Chinese animosity became politicized by labor leader [[Denis Kearney]] and his [[Workingmen's Party of California|party]], as well as by the California governor [[John Bigler]]. Both blamed Chinese ''[[coolies]]'' for depressed wage levels.\n\nIn the first significant restriction on free immigration in U.S. history, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act on May 6, 1882, following revisions made in 1880 to the Burlingame Treaty. Those revisions allowed the United States to suspend [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]], and Congress acted quickly to implement the suspension of Chinese immigration and exclude Chinese skilled and unskilled laborers from entering the country for ten years, under penalty of imprisonment and deportation. The ban was renewed a number of times, lasting for over 60 years.\n\n===Searching for the China market===\nThe [[American China Development Company]], founded in 1895 by industrialists J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie, sought to provide the American capital and management that would generate a rapid industrialization of China. It started building the Hankow-Canton Railroad, to link central and southern China. It only managed to finish 30 miles of line. Americans soon grew disillusioned, and sold out to a rival Belgian syndicate.<ref>William R. Braisted, \"The United States and the American China Development Company,\" ''Far Eastern Quarterly'' 11 (1952): 147\u201365.</ref> On the whole, the American dream of getting rich by investing in China or selling to hundreds of millions of Chinese was almost always a failure.

The [[Military history of China before 1911|campaigns]] took place from November 1899 to September 7, 1901, during the final years of [[Manchu people|Manchu]] rule in China under the [[Qing dynasty]].<ref>Robert A. Bickers, ''Robert A. Bickers, The Scramble for China: Foreign Devils in the Qing Empire, 1800\u20131914'' (London: Allen Lane, 2011)</ref>\n\nThe uprising began as an [[Xenophobia|anti-foreign]], [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]], peasant-based movement in northern China, in response to foreign westerners seizing land from locals, concession grabbing, and granting immunity to criminals who converted to Catholicism. The insurgents attacked foreigners, who were building railroads and violating [[Feng shui]], and [[Christians]], who were held responsible for the foreign domination of China. In June 1900, the Boxers entered [[Beijing|Peking]], and ransacked the area around the Foreign Legations. On June 21, in response to the [[Battle of Dagu Forts (1900)|Western attack on the Chinese Dagu Forts]], [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] declared war against all Western powers. Diplomats, foreign civilians, soldiers, and Chinese Christians were besieged during the [[Siege of the International Legations]] for 55 days. A coalition called the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] comprising [[Austria-Hungary]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and the [[United States]] rushed 20,000 troops to their rescue. The multinational forces were initially defeated by a Chinese Muslim army at the [[Battle of Langfang]], but the second attempt in the [[Gaselee Expedition]] was successful due to internal rivalries among the Chinese forces.\n\n[[File:Marines fight rebellious Boxers outside Peking Legation, 1900.

Copy of painting by Sergeant John Clymer.]]\nThe Chinese government was forced to indemnify the victims and make many additional concessions. Subsequent reforms implemented after the rebellion contributed to the end of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the establishment of the modern [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Chinese Republic]]. The United States played a secondary but significant role in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion, largely due to the presence of US ships and troops deployed in the [[First Philippine Republic|Philippines]] since the American conquest of the [[Spanish\u2013American War|Spanish\u2013American]] and [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. Within the [[United States Armed Forces]], the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion was known as the [[China Relief Expedition]].\n\nThe Chinese paid indemnities to each of the powers. The U.S. used its $11 million share to promote cultural and educational exchanges and help China modernize.  A number of schools were established in China, such as [[Tsinghua University|Tsinghua College]] in Peking.<ref>Michael H.

They supported 500 missionaries in 1890, more than 2000 in 1914, and 8300 in 1920.  By 1927 they opened 16 American universities, six medical schools, and four theology schools, together with 265 middle schools and a large number of elementary schools. The number of converts was not large, but the educational influence was dramatic.<ref>Varg (1980) p 102.</ref>\n\n===Open Door Policy===\n{{Main|Open Door Policy}}\n[[File:Putting his foot down.jpg|thumb|350px|\"Putting his foot down\" Uncle Sam in 1899 demands [[Open Door Policy|Open Door]] while major powers plan to cut up China for themselves; Germany, Italy, England, Austria, Russia & France are represented by Wilhelm II, Umberto I, John Bull, Franz Joseph I (in rear) Uncle Sam, Nicholas II, and Emile Loubet.

The United States demanded these proposals to be discarded so that all nations could trade on an equal footing. In 1899, U.S. Secretary of State [[John Hay]] sent diplomatic letters to these nations, asking them to guarantee the territorial and administrative integrity of China and to not interfere with the free use of [[treaty ports]] within their theoretical spheres of influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=406 |title=Text of the first Open Door note, to Germany |publisher=China.usc.edu |date=1964-10-16 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref> The major powers evaded commitment, saying they could not agree to anything until the other powers had consented first. Hay took this as acceptance of his proposal, which came to be known as the [[Open Door Policy]].<ref>Yoneyuki Sugita, \"The Rise of an American Principle in China: A Reinterpretation of the First Open Door Notes toward China\" in [[Richard J.

The U.S. protested Russia's actions. Japan and Russia fought the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904, in which the U.S. mediated a peace. Japan also presented a further challenge to the policy with its [[Twenty-One Demands]] in 1915 made on the then-[[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. Japan also made secret treaties with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] promising Japan the German territories in China.

Roosevelt]]. A series of [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] had been passed in the US with the support of [[Isolationism|isolationists]] who forbade American aid to countries at war. Because the Second Sino-Japanese War was undeclared, however, Roosevelt denied that a state of war existed in China and proceeded to send aid to Chiang.\n\nAmerican public sympathy for the Chinese was aroused by reports from missionaries, novelists such as [[Pearl S. Buck]], and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' of Japanese brutality in China, including reports surrounding the [[Nanking Massacre]], also known as the 'Rape of Nanking'. Japanese-American relations were further soured by the [[USS Panay incident]] during the bombing of [[Nanjing]], in which a gunboat of the US Navy was accidentally sunk by Japanese aircraft. Roosevelt demanded an apology and compensation from the Japanese, which was received, but relations between the two countries continued to deteriorate.<ref>Hamilton Darby Perry, ''The Panay Incident: Prelude to Pearl Harbor'' (1969).</ref>  American public opinion overwhelmingly favored China and denounced Japan.<ref>Quincy Wright and Carl J.

Congress amended the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and Roosevelt moved to end the [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] by establishing the [[Sino-American New Equal Treaty|Treaty for Relinquishment of Extraterritorial Rights in China]]. However, the perception that Chiang's government was unable to effectively resist the Japanese or that he preferred to focus more on defeating the Communists grew. [[China Hands]] such as [[Joseph Stilwell|Joseph \"Vinegar Joe\" Stilwell]]\u2014who spoke fluent Mandarin Chinese\u2014argued that it was in American interest to establish communication with the Communists to prepare for a land-based counteroffensive invasion of Japan. The [[Dixie Mission]], which began in 1943, was the first official American contact with the Communists. Other Americans, such as [[Claire Lee Chennault]], argued for air power and supported Chiang's position. In 1944, successfully demanded that Stilwell be recalled.

In response to the Soviet-backed North Korean invasion of South Korea, the [[United Nations Security Council]] was convened and passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 82|UNSC Resolution 82]], declaring war on North Korea unanimously. The resolution was adopted mainly because the Soviet Union, a [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto-wielding power]], had been boycotting UN proceedings since January, in protest that the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] and not the [[China|People's Republic of China]] held a permanent seat on the council.<ref>{{cite book |last=Malkasian |first=Carter|title=The Korean War: Essential Histories |publisher=Osprey Publishing |year=2001 |page=16}}</ref>\n\nThe American-led allied forces pushed the invading [[Korean People's Army]] back into North Korea, past the North-South border at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] and began to approach the [[Yalu River]] on the China-North Korea border.

In late March 1951, after the Chinese army had moved large numbers of new forces near the Korean border, US bomb loading pits at [[Kadena Air Base]] in [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] were made operational. On April 5, the US [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] released orders for immediate retaliatory attacks using [[nuclear weapon]]s against Manchurian bases to prevent new Chinese troops from entering the battles or bombing attacks originating from those bases.

In particular, President Johnson and Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] ruled out the possibility of a ground invasion of North Vietnam early on, for fear of repeating the Korean War but now with a thermonuclear-armed China. However, it is unclear exactly what Beijing's reaction to a US invasion of North Vietnam would have been\u2014Mao Zedong reportedly told journalist [[Edgar Snow]] in 1965 that China had no intention of fighting to save the Hanoi regime and would not engage the US military unless it crossed into Chinese territory. On other occasions, Mao expressed confidence that the People's Liberation Army could take on the US again, much like it did in Korea. Whatever Chinese plans might have been, the Johnson Administration was unwilling to tempt fate and so US ground troops never crossed into North Vietnam.<ref>Kwan Ha Yim, ''China & the US, 1964-72'' (1975) pp 57-82.</ref><ref> Frank E.

The United States placed an embargo on trading with the PRC, and encouraged allies to follow it. The [[596 (nuclear test)|PRC developed nuclear weapons]] in 1964 and, as later declassified documents revealed, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] considered preemptive attacks to halt its nuclear program. He ultimately decided the measure carried too much risk and it was abandoned.\n\nFor most of the 22 years between 1949 and 1971, Sino-US relations were uniformly hostile, with Mao Zedong frequently referring to the United States as \"the most dangerous imperialist power\",{{Quote without source|date=April 2018}} and the U.S. frequently attacked by Chinese propaganda. President Kennedy believed that US policy towards China was \"nonsensical\",{{Quote without source|date=April 2018}} and he considered reestablishing diplomatic ties in his second term.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} However, Kennedy's assassination in late 1963, followed by the Vietnam War and Cultural Revolution, ended any possibility of normalized relations with Beijing for years.\n\nDespite this official non-recognition, the United States and the People's Republic of China held 136 meetings at the ambassadorial level beginning in 1954 and continuing until 1970, first in [[Geneva]] and in 1958\u20131970 in Warsaw.<ref>Steven M.

For China, when American president Johnson decided to wind down the Vietnam war in 1968, it gave China an impression that the US had no interest of expanding in Asia anymore while the USSR became a more serious threat as [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|it intervened in Czechoslovakia]] to displace a communist government and might well interfere in China.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dunbabin|first=J.P.D.|title=International relations since 1945|year=1996|publisher=Longman|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-582-49365-0|page=255|edition=[Nachdr.].}}</ref>\n\nThis became an especially important concern for the People's Republic of China after the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] of 1969. The PRC was diplomatically isolated and the leadership came to believe that improved relations with the United States would be a useful counterbalance to the Soviet threat. [[Zhou Enlai]], the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of China]], was at the forefront of this effort with the committed backing of Chairman Mao Zedong. In 1969, the United States initiated measures to relax trade restrictions and other impediments to bilateral contact, to which China responded. However, this rapprochement process was stalled by the Vietnam War where China was supporting the enemies of the United States. Communication between Chinese and American leaders, however, was conducted through [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[Pakistan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nixonfoundation.org/exhibit/the-opening-of-china/|title=The Week that Chenged the World|website=Richard Nixon Foundation|date=2017-01-18}}</ref> and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] as intermediaries.\n\n[[File:Kissinger Mao.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Kissinger, Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong' Kissinger made two secret trips to the PRC in 1971 before Nixon's groundbreaking visit in 1972.]]\n\nIn the United States, academics such as [[John K. Fairbank]] and [[A. Doak Barnett]] pointed to the need to deal realistically with the Beijing government, while organizations such as the [[National Committee on United States\u2013China Relations]] sponsored debates to promote public awareness. Many saw the specter of Communist China behind communist movements in [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]], but a growing number concluded that if the PRC would align with the US it would mean a major redistribution of global power against the Soviets. Mainland China's market of nearly one billion consumers appealed to American business. Senator [[J. William Fulbright]], Chair of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], held a series of hearings on the matter.<ref>Goh, Evelyn, ''Constructing the US Rapprochement with China, 1961\u20131974: From 'Red Menace' to 'Tacit Ally' '', Cambridge University Press, 2005</ref>\n \nRichard M. Nixon mentioned in his [[First inauguration of Richard Nixon|inaugural address]] that the two countries were entering an era of negotiation after an era of confrontation. Although Nixon during his 1960 presidential campaign had vociferously supported Chiang Kai-Shek, by the second half of the decade, he increasingly began to speak of there \"being no reason to leave China angry and isolated\". Nixon's election as president in 1968 was initially met with hostility by Beijing\u2014an editorial in the ''People's Daily'' denounced him as \"a chieftain whom the capitalist world had turned to out of desperation\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Leffler|first=edited by Melvyn P.|title=The Cambridge history of the Cold War.|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-83720-0|page=373|edition=1. publ.|author2=Westad, Odd Arne}}</ref> Nixon believed it was in the American national interest to forge a relationship with China, even though there were enormous differences between the two countries.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dube|first=Clayton|title=Getting to Beijing: Kissinger's Secret 1971 Trip|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2483|publisher=USC US-China Institute|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>  He was assisted in this by his [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]]. Domestic politics also entered into Nixon's thinking, as the boost from a successful courting of the PRC could help him in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 American presidential election]]. He also worried that one of the Democrats would preempt him and go to the PRC before he had the opportunity.\n\nIn 1971, an unexpectedly friendly encounter between the American and Chinese ping-pong athletes called [[Glenn Cowan]] and [[Zhuang Zedong]] in Japan opened the way for a visit to China, which Chairman Mao personally approved.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dube|first=Clayton|title=Sports diplomacy and back channel negotiations|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2470|work=Talking Points, July 22 \u2013 August 3, 2011|publisher=USC US-China Institute|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>  In April 1971, the athletes became the first Americans to officially visit China since the communist takeover. The smooth acceptance of this so-called \"[[ping-pong diplomacy]]\" gave confidence to both sides. In July 1971, Henry Kissinger feigned illness while on a trip to Pakistan and did not appear in public for a day. He was actually on a top-secret mission to Beijing to negotiate with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai.\n\nKissinger and his aides did not receive a warm welcome in Beijing, and the hotel they stayed in was equipped with pamphlets excoriating US imperialism. However, the meeting with Zhou Enlai was productive, and the Chinese premier expressed his hope for improved Sino-US relations. He commented that the US had intentionally isolated China, not vice versa, and any initiative to restore diplomatic ties had to come from the American side. Zhou spoke of the late President Kennedy's plans to restore relations with China and told Kissinger \"We are willing to wait as long as we need to. If these negotiations fail, in time another Kennedy or another Nixon will come along.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kisslibrary.com/book/7138CDB42A74355EA5B6?search=2011+American+Business+in+China+White+Paper&a_aid=ddmidovv&a_bid=11110007|title=2011 American Business in China White Paper by American Chamber of Commerce in China / KissLibrary: Affordable Ebooks|website=kisslibrary.com|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\nOn July 15, 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] revealed the mission to the world and that he had accepted an invitation to visit the PRC.<ref>Magaret MacMillan, ''Nixon and Mao: The Week That Changed The World'' (2008)</ref>\n\nThis announcement<ref>{{cite web|last=Nixon|first=Richard|title=Announcement of the President's Trip to China|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2258|work=US-China documents collection|publisher=USC US-China Institute|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>  caused immediate shock around the world. In the United States, some hard-line anti-communists (most notably Arizona Senator [[Barry Goldwater]]) denounced the decision, but most public opinion supported the move and Nixon saw the jump in the polls he had been hoping for. Since Nixon had sterling anti-communist credentials he was all but immune to being called \"soft on communism.\" Nixon and his aides wanted to ensure that press coverage offered dramatic imagery.<ref>See [http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2705 \"Getting to know you: The US and China shake the world\"] and [http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2672 \"The Week that Changed the World\"] for recordings, documents, and interviews.</ref> Nixon was particularly eager for strong news coverage.\n\n[[File:President and Mrs. Nixon visit the Great Wall of China and the Ming tombs - NARA - 194421.tif|thumb|right|President Nixon and First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] walk with the American delegation and their Chinese hosts on the [[Great Wall of China]].]]\n[[File:Nixon and Zhou toast.jpg|thumb|right|President Nixon and Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] toast during Nixon's 1972 visit to China]]\nWithin the PRC there was also opposition from left-wing elements. This effort was allegedly led by [[Lin Biao]], head of the military, who died in a mysterious plane crash over [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]] while trying to defect to the Soviet Union. His death silenced most internal dissent over the visit.\n\nInternationally, reactions varied. In the communist world, the Soviets were very concerned that two major enemies seemed to have resolved their differences, and the new world alignment contributed significantly to the policy of ''[[d\u00e9tente]]''. Romania's president [[Nicolai Ceausescu|Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] praised the US initiative as a \"move for world peace\".{{Quote without source|date=April 2018}} Several communist regimes, including Cuba, Albania, and North Vietnam, accused China of \"capitulationism to the imperialists\".{{Quote without source|date=April 2018}} North Korea proclaimed that it was the reverse and that the US had been forced to capitulate to China, having failed to isolate it.\n\nAmerica's European [[NATO|allies]] and [[Canada]] were pleased by the initiative, especially since many of them had already recognized the PRC. In [[Asia]], the reaction was far more mixed. [[Japan]] was annoyed that it had not been told of the announcement until fifteen minutes before it had been made, and feared that the Americans were abandoning them in favor of the PRC. A short time later, Japan also recognized the PRC and committed to substantial trade with the continental power. [[South Korea]] and [[South Vietnam]] were both concerned that peace between the United States and the PRC could mean an end to American support for them against their communist enemies. Throughout the period of rapprochement, both countries had to be regularly assured that they would not be abandoned.\n\nFrom February 21 to February 28, 1972, President Nixon [[1972 Nixon visit to China|traveled]] to [[Beijing]], [[Hangzhou]], and [[Shanghai]]. At the conclusion of his trip, the US and the PRC issued the [[Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9]], a statement of their respective foreign policy views. In the Communiqu\u00e9, both nations pledged to work toward the full normalization of diplomatic relations. This did not lead to immediate recognition of the People's Republic of China but 'liaison offices' were established in Beijing and Washington.<ref name=\"Dunbabin 1996 258\">{{cite book|last=Dunbabin|first=J.P.D.|title=International relations since 1945|year=1996|publisher=Longman|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-582-49365-0|page=258|edition=[Nachdr.].}}</ref> The US acknowledged the PRC position that all Chinese on both sides of the [[Taiwan Strait]] maintain that [[One-China policy|there is only one China]] and that Taiwan is part of China. The statement enabled the US and PRC to temporarily set aside the issue of Taiwan and open trade and communication. Also, the US and China both agreed to take action against 'any country' that is to establish 'hegemony' in the Asia-Pacific. On several issues, such as the ongoing conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and Israel, the US and China were unable to reach a common understanding.<ref name=\"Dunbabin 1996 258\"/>\n\nMost major anti-US propaganda disappeared in China after the Nixon visit; although there was still occasional criticism of US imperialism, the Soviet Union had definitively become China's arch-foe in the 1970s.\n\nThe rapprochement with the United States benefited the PRC immensely and greatly increased its security for the rest of the [[Cold War]]. It has been argued that the United States, on the other hand, saw fewer benefits than it had hoped for, inasmuch as China continued to back America's enemies in Hanoi and Pyongyang. Eventually, however, the PRC's suspicion of Vietnam's motives led to a break in Sino-Vietnamese cooperation and, upon the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1979, the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]]. Both China and the United States backed combatants in [[Africa]] against Soviet and [[Cuba]]n-supported movements. The economic benefits of normalization were slow as it would take decades for American products to penetrate the vast Chinese market. While Nixon's China policy is regarded by many as the highlight of his presidency, others such as [[William Bundy]] have argued that it provided very little benefit to the United States.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Liaison Office (1973\u20131978)===\n[[File:President Ford makes remarks in the People's Republic of China - NARA - 7062599.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Gerald Ford]] makes remarks at a Reciprocal Dinner in Beijing on December 4, 1975.]]\n\nIn May 1973, in an effort to build toward formal diplomatic relations, the US and the PRC established the [[United States Liaison Office]] (USLO) in Beijing and a counterpart PRC office in Washington.

Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, Carter's National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], and senior staff member of the National Security Council [[Michel Oksenberg]] encouraged Carter to seek full diplomatic and trade relations with China. Although Brzezinski sought to quickly establish a security relationship with Beijing to counter the Soviet Union, Carter sided with Vance in believing that such a deal would threaten existing U.S.-Soviet relations, including the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II]] negotiations. Thus, the administration decided to cautiously pursue political normalization and not military relations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vance|first1=Cyrus|title=Hard Choices|date=1983|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=78\u201379}}</ref> Vance, Brzezinski, and Oksenberg traveled to Beijing in early 1978 to work with [[Leonard Woodcock]], then head of the liaison office, to lay the groundwork to do so.

The US reiterated the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9's acknowledgment of the Chinese position that there is only [[One-China policy|one China]] and that Taiwan is a part of China; Beijing acknowledged that the American people would continue to carry on commercial, cultural, and other unofficial contacts with the people of Taiwan.<ref>Jim Mann, ''About face: A history of America's curious relationship with China, from Nixon to Clinton'' (1999).</ref>\n\nMuch like the Nixon visit to Beijing six years earlier, the formal establishment of Sino-US ties met with a mixed response from many countries. Taiwan, although fully expecting this step, nonetheless expressed disappointment at having not been consulted first. The reaction of the communist world was similar to 1972, with the Soviet Union and its allies in Eastern Europe mostly being noncommittal, Romania welcoming the move, and Cuba and Albania being strongly against it. North Korea issued a statement congratulating \"our brotherly neighbors for ending long-hostile relations with the US\".{{Quote without source|date=April 2018}}\n\nVice Premier [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s [[1979 visit by Deng Xiaoping to the United States|January 1979 visit]] to Washington initiated a series of important, high-level exchanges which continued until the spring of 1989. This resulted in many bilateral agreements, especially in the fields of scientific, technological, and cultural interchange, as well as trade relations. Since early 1979, the United States and the PRC have initiated hundreds of joint research projects and cooperative programs under the Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology, the largest bilateral program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=1196 |title=US-China Institute :: news & features :: china in u.s. campaign politics: part 6 of election '08 and the challenge of china |publisher=China.usc.edu |date=1964-10-16 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref>\n\nOn March 1, 1979, the two countries formally established embassies in each other's capitals. In 1979, outstanding private claims were resolved and a bilateral trade agreement was completed. Vice President Walter Mondale reciprocated Vice Premier Deng's visit with an August 1979 trip to China. This visit led to agreements in September 1980 on maritime affairs, civil aviation links, and textile matters, as well as a bilateral consular convention.\n\nThe threats of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[Cambodian-Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia]] were major factors that brought Washington and Beijing closer than ever before.<ref name=shichor>{{cite book|last=Frederick Starr|first=S.|title=Xinjiang: China's Muslim Borderland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXj4a3gss8wC&pg=PA157|year=2004|publisher=M.E.

In 1983, the US State Department changed its classification of China to \"a friendly, developing nation\",{{Quote without source|date=April 2018}} thereby increasing the amount of technology and armaments that could be sold. The skepticism of some US Congressmen was not entirely unmerited as China during the 1980s continued to sell arms to [[Iran]] and other states that were openly hostile to American interests.\n\n[[File:Carter DengXiaoping (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Deng Xiaoping with [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]]]\nAs a consequence of high-level and working-level contacts initiated in 1980, New York City and Beijing become sister cities, US dialogue with the PRC broadened to cover a wide range of issues, including global and regional strategic problems, political-military questions, including arms control, UN, and other multilateral organization affairs, and international narcotics matters.<ref>Michel Oksenberg, \"Reconsiderations: A Decade of Sino-American Relations.\" ''Foreign Affairs'' 61.1 (1982): 190.</ref>\n\nHigh-level exchanges continued to be a significant means for developing US\u2013PRC relations in the 1980s. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and Premier [[Zhao Ziyang]] made reciprocal visits in 1984. Reagan's visit to Beijing went well, however a speech he made criticizing the Soviet Union and praising capitalism, democracy, and freedom of religion was not aired on Chinese state TV. In July 1985, Chinese President [[Li Xiannian]] traveled to the United States, the first such visit by a PRC head of state. Vice President Bush visited the PRC in October 1985 and opened the US Consulate General in [[Chengdu]], the US's fourth consular post in the PRC. Further exchanges of cabinet-level officials occurred between 1985 and 1989, capped by President Bush's visit to Beijing in February 1989.\n\n[[File:Zhao Ziyang cropped.jpg|left|150px|thumb|President [[Ronald Reagan]] walking with Premier [[Zhao Ziyang]] during his visit to the White House on 10 January 1984.]]\n\nShortly after being elected president in 1980, Ronald Reagan made a speech criticizing the PRC and welcoming restoration of ties with Taiwan. These remarks aroused initial panic in Beijing, but Reagan's advisers quickly apologized for his comments, and the president-elect soon retracted them.\n\nReagan's first two years in office saw some deterioration in Sino-US relations due to the president's vociferous anti-communism, as well as the inability of the two nations to come to a common understanding over the Korean standoff, the Israel\u2013Palestine conflict, or the Falkland War. In 1982, Deng Xiaoping, in a reiteration of Mao Zedong's \"Three Worlds\" theory, criticized both the US and Soviet Union for imperialism. In 1983, there were quarrels over a Chinese tennis player, Hu Na, who defected to the US, and over an incident where an Olympic parade float in New York City displayed the flag of Taiwan rather than the PRC's flag.\n\nIn the period before the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], a growing number of cultural exchange activities gave the American and Chinese peoples broad exposure to each other's cultural, artistic, and educational achievements. Numerous mainland Chinese professional and official delegations visited the United States each month. Many of these exchanges continued after the suppression of the Tiananmen protests.<ref>Robert Suettinger, ''Beyond Tiananmen: The Politics of US-China Relations, 1989\u20132000'' (Brookings Institution Press, 2004).</ref>\n\n===Taiwan issue===\nSince the renewal of Sino-American relations in early 1979, the Taiwan issue remained a major source of contention.

The expanding relationship that followed normalization was threatened in 1981 by PRC objections to the level of US arms sales to the Republic of China on Taiwan. Secretary of State [[Alexander Haig]] visited China in June 1981 in an effort to resolve Chinese concerns about America's unofficial relations with Taiwan. Vice President Bush visited the PRC in May 1982. Eight months of negotiations produced the US-PRC Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of August 17, 1982. In this third communiqu\u00e9, the US stated its intention to gradually reduce the level of arms sales to the Republic of China, and the PRC described as a fundamental policy their effort to strive for a peaceful resolution to the [[political status of Taiwan|Taiwan question]]. China's Ambassador to Washington, in an interview with [[CGTN (TV channel)|CGTN]] in April 2018, is quoted as saying that Sino-American relations hinge largely upon the US-PRC Joint Communiqu\u00e9 signed between the two parties and where the USA had agreed not to challenge the PRC's sovereignty over the island of Taiwan, but to respect China's \"anti-secession law,\" until such time that Taiwan will be reunified with the Mainland.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giBRQ1q1yJg Dialogue: Interview with China's Ambassador to the US], [[CGTN (TV channel)|CGTV]], 4 April 2018 (minutes: 16:22\u201320:13).</ref> When the Trump administration came to power, contention over the Taiwan issue intensified; President Trump became the first sitting US president since Jimmy Carter in 1979 to have any formal political or diplomatic contacts with Taiwan when he decided to receive a phone call from president Tsai Ing-Wen.

In addition, American warships have reportedly crossed the Taiwan strait and increased military drills with Taiwan, which mainland China views as a direct threat to its sovereignty. The Taiwanese government has also warned the Solomon Islands not to switch recognition to the PRC as part of a bid to preserve its shrinking number of allies worldwide.<ref name=\"cnn.com\">{{cite news| title= US Navy warship challenges Chinese claims in the South China Sea| url= https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/13/_politics-zone-injection/us-warship-south-china-sea/index.html}}</ref><ref name=\"cnn.com\"/><ref name=\"asia.nikkei.com\">{{cite news| title=In Beijing rebuke, Taiwan signals closer defense ties with US and Japan|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/In-Beijing-rebuke-Taiwan-signals-closer-defense-ties-with-US-and-Japan }}</ref><ref name=\"asia.nikkei.com\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. officials urge caution as Solomons considers cutting Taiwan link|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pacific-china-solomonislands/us-officials-urge-caution-as-solomons-considers-cutting-taiwan-link-idUSKCN1VX0F7}}</ref>\n\n===Tiananmen protests to 9/11 attacks (1989\u20132001)===\n[[File:Clinton and jiang.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Clinton]] and [[Jiang Zemin]] holding a joint press conference at the White House, October 29, 1997.]]\nFollowing China's [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989#Military action|violent suppression]] of [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|political protests]] in June 1989, the US and other governments enacted a number of measures against China's violation of [[Human rights in China|human rights]].

The United States dispatched two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region. Subsequently, tensions in the Taiwan Strait diminished and relations between the US and the PRC improved, with increased high-level exchanges and progress on numerous bilateral issues, including human rights, [[nuclear proliferation]], and trade. China's leader [[Jiang Zemin]] visited the United States in the fall of 1997, the first state visit to the US by a [[President of the People's Republic of China|PRC president]] since 1985 and the first visit to the US by a [[paramount leader]] since 1979. In connection with that visit, the two sides came to a consensus on implementation of their 1985 agreement on Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation, as well as a number of other issues.<ref>U.Hawaii, 1997</ref> President Clinton visited the PRC in June 1998. He traveled extensively in mainland China, and had direct interaction with the Chinese people, including live speeches and a radio show which allowed the President to convey a sense of American ideals and values. President Clinton was criticized by some, however, for failing to pay adequate attention to human rights abuses in mainland China.<ref>Eckholm</ref>\n\nRelations were damaged for a time by the [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]] in May 1999, which was stated by the White House to be miscoordination between intelligence and the military, although which some Chinese believed to be deliberate. In any case, Beijing for several days was rocked by massive anti-US demonstrations. By the end of 1999, relations began to gradually improve. In October 1999, the two countries reached an agreement on compensation for families of those who were victims, as well as payments for damages to respective diplomatic properties in [[Belgrade]] and China. Sino-US relations in 1999 were also damaged by accusations that a Chinese-American scientist at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] had given US nuclear secrets to Beijing.\n\nIn April 2001, a PRC [[Shenyang J-8|J-8 fighter jet]] collided with a US [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3]] reconnaissance aircraft flying south of the PRC in what became known as the [[Hainan Island incident]]. The EP-3 was able to make an emergency landing on PRC's [[Hainan|Hainan Island]] despite extensive damage; the PRC aircraft crashed with the loss of its pilot, Wang Wei. The crew were detained by the PLA after destroying all classified documents pertaining to the aircraft's operation. It was widely believed that the EP-3 recon aircraft was conducting a spying mission on the PLA before the collision, which however took place over international waters. Following extensive negotiations resulting in the \"letter of the two sorries,\" the crew of the EP-3 was released from imprisonment and allowed to leave the PRC eleven days later. The US aircraft was returned by Beijing three months later in pieces, after which the relationship between the US and the PRC gradually improved once more.\n\n===George W.

The PRC, itself troubled by Muslim separatists in Xinjiang, offered strong public support for the [[War on Terror]] in [[APEC China 2001]]. The PRC voted in favor of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373|UNSCR 1373]], publicly supported the coalition campaign in [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/china/29871.htm |title=U.S. State Department \u2013 China (03/03) |publisher=state.gov |accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref> and contributed $150 million of bilateral assistance to Afghan reconstruction following the defeat of the [[Taliban]]. Shortly after 9/11, the US and PRC also commenced a counterterrorism dialogue. The third round of that dialogue was held in Beijing in February 2003.\n\nIn the United States, the terrorist attacks greatly changed the nature of discourse. It was no longer plausible to argue, as the [[Blue Team (U.S. politics)|Blue Team]] had earlier asserted, that the PRC was the primary security threat to the United States, and the need to focus on the [[Middle East]] and the [[War on Terror]] made the avoidance of potential distractions in East Asia a priority for the United States.\n\nThere were initial fears among the PRC leadership that the war on terrorism would lead to an anti-PRC effort by the US, especially as the US began establishing bases in [[Central Asia]]n countries like [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]] and renewed efforts against [[Iraq]]. Because of setbacks in America's Iraq campaign, these fears have largely subsided. The application of American power in Iraq and continuing efforts by the United States to cooperate with the PRC has significantly reduced the popular anti-Americanism that had developed in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe PRC and the US have also worked closely on regional issues, including those pertaining to [[North Korea]] and its [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons program]]. The People's Republic of China has stressed its opposition to North Korea's decision to withdraw from the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]], its concerns over North Korea's nuclear capabilities, and its desire for a non-nuclear [[Korean Peninsula]]. It also voted to refer North Korea's noncompliance with its [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] obligations to the UN Security Council.\n\nTaiwan remains a volatile issue, but one that remains under control. The United States policy toward Taiwan has involved emphasizing the [[Four Noes and One Without]]. On occasion the United States has rebuked Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian for provocative pro-independence rhetoric. However, in 2005, the PRC passed the [[Anti-Secession Law]] which stated that the PRC would be prepared to resort to \"non-peaceful means\" if Taiwan declared formal independence. Many critics of the PRC, such as the Blue Team, argue that the PRC was trying to take advantage of the US war in Iraq to assert its claims on Republic of China's territory. In 2008, Taiwan voters elected Ma Ying-jeou. Ma, representing the Kuomintang, campaigned on a platform that included rapprochement with mainland China. His election has significant implications for the future of cross-strait relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=986 |title=US-China Institute :: news & features :: usci symposium explores the taiwan vote |publisher=China.usc.edu |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref>\n\nChina's paramount leader Hu Jintao visited the United States in April 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=442 |title=Text of Pres.

Mainland China has increasingly become the last link in a long chain of value-added production. Because US trade data attributes the full value of a product to the final assembler, mainland Chinese value added is overcounted.\n*US demand for labor-intensive goods exceeds domestic output: the PRC has restrictive trade practices in mainland China, which include a wide array of barriers to foreign goods and services, often aimed at protecting [[state-owned enterprise]]s. These practices include high [[tariff]]s, lack of transparency, requiring firms to obtain special permission to import goods, inconsistent application of laws and regulations, and leveraging technology from foreign firms in return for market access. Mainland China's accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] is meant to help address these barriers.\n*The undervaluation of the [[Renminbi]] relative to the [[United States dollar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/01/data/weorept.aspx?sy=2004&ey=2007&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=924&s=PPPEX&grp=0&a=&pr1.x=62&pr1.y=9 |title=''World Economic Outlook Database, April 2007'' |publisher=Imf.org |date=2006-09-14 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 2009, the US and China agreed to hold regular high-level talks about economic issues and other mutual concerns by establishing the [[Strategic Economic Dialogue]], which meets biannually.

President [[John Tyler]] In 1843 appointed \nMassachusetts diplomat [[Caleb Cushing]] as commissioner and [[United States Ambassador to China|Minister]]. With the goal of impressing the Royal Chinese court, the Cushing mission suddenly appeared with four American warships, loaded with gifts that exalted scientific wonders including revolvers, telescopes, and an encyclopedia. His arrival at Macau in February 1844 created a local sensation, but the Chinese government was reluctant to designate another most favored nation. Cushing cleverly mixed the carrot and stick. He warned \u2013 against the backdrop of his warships \u2013 that not to receive an envoy was a national insult. He threatened to go directly to the Emperor \u2013 an unheard of procedure. The Emperor tried delay, but he finally sent an envoy to negotiate with Cushing, leading to the signing of the [[Treaty of Wanghia]] in the village of Wanghia on July 3, 1844. In addition to most favored nation status, Cushing made sure that Americans received [[extraterritoriality]], which meant that legal cases involving Americans inside China would be tried by Western judges, not by Chinese judges. In the following years American trade with China grew rapidly, thanks to the high-speed clipper ships which carried relatively small amounts of high-value cargo, such as ginseng and silk. American Protestant missionaries also began to arrive.  The popular Chinese reaction was mostly hostile, but there was a favorable element that provided a base of support for American missionaries and businessmen. By 1850-64, China was emeshed in the Taiping rebellion which caused millions of lives, and foreign trade stagnated.<ref>{{cite book |last=Koon|first=Yeewan |editor-last=Johnson |editor-first=Kendall|title=Narratives of Free Trade: The Commercial Cultures of Early US-China Relations|publisher=Hong Kong University Press |date=2012 |pages=131\u2013148 |chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/8340388 |chapter=The Face of Diplomacy in 19th-Century China: Qiying's Portrait Gifts }}</ref><ref>Richard E.

Burlingame toured the country to build support for equitable treatment for China and for Chinese emigrants. The 1868 [[Burlingame Treaty]] embodied these principles. In 1871, the [[Chinese Educational Mission]] brought the first of two groups of 120 Chinese boys to study in the United States. They were led by [[Yung Wing]], the first Chinese man to graduate from an American university.\n\nDuring the [[California Gold Rush]] and the construction of the [[transcontinental railroad]], large numbers of Chinese emigrated to the U.S., spurring animosity from American citizens. After being forcibly driven from the mines, most Chinese settled in [[Chinatown]]s in cities such as [[San Francisco]], taking up low-end wage labor, such as restaurant and cleaning work. With the post-Civil War economy in decline by the 1870s, anti-Chinese animosity became politicized by labor leader [[Denis Kearney]] and his [[Workingmen's Party of California|party]], as well as by the California governor [[John Bigler]]. Both blamed Chinese ''[[coolies]]'' for depressed wage levels.\n\nIn the first significant restriction on free immigration in U.S. history, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act on May 6, 1882, following revisions made in 1880 to the Burlingame Treaty. Those revisions allowed the United States to suspend [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]], and Congress acted quickly to implement the suspension of Chinese immigration and exclude Chinese skilled and unskilled laborers from entering the country for ten years, under penalty of imprisonment and deportation. The ban was renewed a number of times, lasting for over 60 years.\n\n===Searching for the China market===\nThe [[American China Development Company]], founded in 1895 by industrialists J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie, sought to provide the American capital and management that would generate a rapid industrialization of China. It started building the Hankow-Canton Railroad, to link central and southern China. It only managed to finish 30 miles of line. Americans soon grew disillusioned, and sold out to a rival Belgian syndicate.<ref>William R. Braisted, \"The United States and the American China Development Company,\" ''Far Eastern Quarterly'' 11 (1952): 147\u201365.</ref> On the whole, the American dream of getting rich by investing in China or selling to hundreds of millions of Chinese was almost always a failure.

The [[Military history of China before 1911|campaigns]] took place from November 1899 to September 7, 1901, during the final years of [[Manchu people|Manchu]] rule in China under the [[Qing dynasty]].<ref>Robert A. Bickers, ''Robert A. Bickers, The Scramble for China: Foreign Devils in the Qing Empire, 1800\u20131914'' (London: Allen Lane, 2011)</ref>\n\nThe uprising began as an [[Xenophobia|anti-foreign]], [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]], peasant-based movement in northern China, in response to foreign westerners seizing land from locals, concession grabbing, and granting immunity to criminals who converted to Catholicism. The insurgents attacked foreigners, who were building railroads and violating [[Feng shui]], and [[Christians]], who were held responsible for the foreign domination of China. In June 1900, the Boxers entered [[Beijing|Peking]], and ransacked the area around the Foreign Legations. On June 21, in response to the [[Battle of Dagu Forts (1900)|Western attack on the Chinese Dagu Forts]], [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] declared war against all Western powers. Diplomats, foreign civilians, soldiers, and Chinese Christians were besieged during the [[Siege of the International Legations]] for 55 days. A coalition called the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] comprising [[Austria-Hungary]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and the [[United States]] rushed 20,000 troops to their rescue. The multinational forces were initially defeated by a Chinese Muslim army at the [[Battle of Langfang]], but the second attempt in the [[Gaselee Expedition]] was successful due to internal rivalries among the Chinese forces.\n\n[[File:Marines fight rebellious Boxers outside Peking Legation, 1900.

Copy of painting by Sergeant John Clymer.]]\nThe Chinese government was forced to indemnify the victims and make many additional concessions. Subsequent reforms implemented after the rebellion contributed to the end of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the establishment of the modern [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Chinese Republic]]. The United States played a secondary but significant role in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion, largely due to the presence of US ships and troops deployed in the [[First Philippine Republic|Philippines]] since the American conquest of the [[Spanish\u2013American War|Spanish\u2013American]] and [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. Within the [[United States Armed Forces]], the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion was known as the [[China Relief Expedition]].\n\nThe Chinese paid indemnities to each of the powers. The U.S. used its $11 million share to promote cultural and educational exchanges and help China modernize.  A number of schools were established in China, such as [[Tsinghua University|Tsinghua College]] in Peking.<ref>Michael H.

They supported 500 missionaries in 1890, more than 2000 in 1914, and 8300 in 1920.  By 1927 they opened 16 American universities, six medical schools, and four theology schools, together with 265 middle schools and a large number of elementary schools. The number of converts was not large, but the educational influence was dramatic.<ref>Varg (1980) p 102.</ref>\n\n===Open Door Policy===\n{{Main|Open Door Policy}}\n[[File:Putting his foot down.jpg|thumb|350px|\"Putting his foot down\" Uncle Sam in 1899 demands [[Open Door Policy|Open Door]] while major powers plan to cut up China for themselves; Germany, Italy, England, Austria, Russia & France are represented by Wilhelm II, Umberto I, John Bull, Franz Joseph I (in rear) Uncle Sam, Nicholas II, and Emile Loubet.

The United States demanded these proposals to be discarded so that all nations could trade on an equal footing. In 1899, U.S. Secretary of State [[John Hay]] sent diplomatic letters to these nations, asking them to guarantee the territorial and administrative integrity of China and to not interfere with the free use of [[treaty ports]] within their theoretical spheres of influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=406 |title=Text of the first Open Door note, to Germany |publisher=China.usc.edu |date=1964-10-16 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref> The major powers evaded commitment, saying they could not agree to anything until the other powers had consented first. Hay took this as acceptance of his proposal, which came to be known as the [[Open Door Policy]].<ref>Yoneyuki Sugita, \"The Rise of an American Principle in China: A Reinterpretation of the First Open Door Notes toward China\" in [[Richard J.

The U.S. protested Russia's actions. Japan and Russia fought the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904, in which the U.S. mediated a peace. Japan also presented a further challenge to the policy with its [[Twenty-One Demands]] in 1915 made on the then-[[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. Japan also made secret treaties with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] promising Japan the German territories in China. In 1931, Japan [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invaded and occupied Manchuria]]. The United States along with other countries condemned the action, leading to U.S. support for China in its war with Japan after 1937.<ref>Youli Sun and You-Li Sun, ''China and the Origins of the Pacific War, 1931\u20131941'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1993.)</ref>\n[[File:Schneider mansion.jpg|thumb|Residence of China's envoy [[Wu Tingfang]] ]]\n\n==The Republic of China and the United States of America==\n\n===1911\u20131937===\nAfter the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, the [[United States]] government recognized the [[Government of the Chinese Republic]] as the sole and legitimate government of China despite [[Warlord Era|a number of governments]] ruling various parts of China.

They discovered the demand for Western education was much stronger, and much more elite, than the demand for Christianity.  Programs were set up to fund Chinese students In American colleges.<ref>Madeline Y.

Roosevelt]]. A series of [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] had been passed in the US with the support of [[Isolationism|isolationists]] who forbade American aid to countries at war. Because the Second Sino-Japanese War was undeclared, however, Roosevelt denied that a state of war existed in China and proceeded to send aid to Chiang.\n\nAmerican public sympathy for the Chinese was aroused by reports from missionaries, novelists such as [[Pearl S. Buck]], and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' of Japanese brutality in China, including reports surrounding the [[Nanking Massacre]], also known as the 'Rape of Nanking'. Japanese-American relations were further soured by the [[USS Panay incident]] during the bombing of [[Nanjing]], in which a gunboat of the US Navy was accidentally sunk by Japanese aircraft. Roosevelt demanded an apology and compensation from the Japanese, which was received, but relations between the two countries continued to deteriorate.<ref>Hamilton Darby Perry, ''The Panay Incident: Prelude to Pearl Harbor'' (1969).</ref>  American public opinion overwhelmingly favored China and denounced Japan.<ref>Quincy Wright and Carl J.

Congress amended the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and Roosevelt moved to end the [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] by establishing the [[Sino-American New Equal Treaty|Treaty for Relinquishment of Extraterritorial Rights in China]]. However, the perception that Chiang's government was unable to effectively resist the Japanese or that he preferred to focus more on defeating the Communists grew. [[China Hands]] such as [[Joseph Stilwell|Joseph \"Vinegar Joe\" Stilwell]]\u2014who spoke fluent Mandarin Chinese\u2014argued that it was in American interest to establish communication with the Communists to prepare for a land-based counteroffensive invasion of Japan. The [[Dixie Mission]], which began in 1943, was the first official American contact with the Communists. Other Americans, such as [[Claire Lee Chennault]], argued for air power and supported Chiang's position. In 1944, successfully demanded that Stilwell be recalled. General [[Albert Coady Wedemeyer]] replaced Stilwell, and [[Patrick J. Hurley]] became ambassador.<ref>Michael Schaller, ''The US Crusade in China, 1938\u20131945'' (1979).</ref><ref>Herbert Feis, ''The China Tangle: The American Effort in China from Pearl Harbor to the Marshall Mission'' (1953)</ref>\n\n===Civil War in Mainland China===\nAfter World War II ended in 1945, the hostility between the Nationalists and the Communists exploded into the open [[Chinese Civil War]].

Such a dissipation of U.S. resources would inevitably play into the hands of the Russians, or would provoke a reaction which would possibly, even probably, lead to another Spanish type of revolution or general hostilities....the cost of an all-out effort to see Communist forces resisted and destroyed in China...would clearly be out of all proportion to the results to be obtained.<ref>George Marshall testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, 20 February 1948, in {{cite book|author=Sharon Ritenour Stevens and Mark A.

An enemy of the Chiang family, [[K. C. Wu]], was removed from his position as governor of Taiwan by [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] and fled to America in 1953. [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[president of the Republic of China]] (ROC), suspected that the American CIA was engineering a coup with [[Sun Li-jen]], an American-educated Chinese man who attended the [[Virginia Military Institute]], with the goal of making Taiwan an independent state.

In response to the Soviet-backed North Korean invasion of South Korea, the [[United Nations Security Council]] was convened and passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 82|UNSC Resolution 82]], declaring war on North Korea unanimously. The resolution was adopted mainly because the Soviet Union, a [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto-wielding power]], had been boycotting UN proceedings since January, in protest that the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] and not the [[China|People's Republic of China]] held a permanent seat on the council.<ref>{{cite book |last=Malkasian |first=Carter|title=The Korean War: Essential Histories |publisher=Osprey Publishing |year=2001 |page=16}}</ref>\n\nThe American-led allied forces pushed the invading [[Korean People's Army]] back into North Korea, past the North-South border at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] and began to approach the [[Yalu River]] on the China-North Korea border. Chinese warnings for the UN forces to not venture too close to their border were ignored, and in November 1950, a massive Chinese counterattack was launched. The Chinese army struck in the west along the Chongchon River and completely overran several South Korean divisions, successfully landing a heavy blow to the flank of the remaining forces.

In late March 1951, after the Chinese army had moved large numbers of new forces near the Korean border, US bomb loading pits at [[Kadena Air Base]] in [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] were made operational. On April 5, the US [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] released orders for immediate retaliatory attacks using [[nuclear weapon]]s against Manchurian bases to prevent new Chinese troops from entering the battles or bombing attacks originating from those bases. On the same day, Truman gave his approval for transfer of nine Mark IV nuclear capsules \"to the [[United States Air Force|Air Force's]] [[9th Operations Group|Ninth Bomb Group]], the designated carrier of the weapons,\"{{Quote without source|date=April 2018}} signing an order to use them against Chinese and Korean targets.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Two years of continued fighting ended in a stalemate, until the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] was signed on July 27, 1953. Since then, a [[Division of Korea|divided Korea]] has become an important factor in US-China relations. Also, the entry of China in the Korean War caused a major change in US policy from minimal support of the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist government]] in [[Taiwan]] to Taiwan as protected by the United States.\n\n===Vietnam War===\n{{Main|Vietnam War}}\n\nThe People's Republic of China provided resources and training to North Vietnam, and in the summer of 1962, Mao agreed to supply Hanoi with 90,000 rifles and guns free of charge. After the launch of the America's Operation \"Rolling Thunder\" in 1965, China sent anti-aircraft units and engineering battalions to North Vietnam to repair the damage caused by American bombing, rebuild roads and railroads, and perform other engineering work, freeing additional hundreds of thousands North Vietnamese army units for combat in American supported South Vietnam. The United States lost 58,159 troops in the Vietnam War.<ref>Xiaorong Han,  \"Spoiled guests or dedicated patriots?

In particular, President Johnson and Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] ruled out the possibility of a ground invasion of North Vietnam early on, for fear of repeating the Korean War but now with a thermonuclear-armed China. However, it is unclear exactly what Beijing's reaction to a US invasion of North Vietnam would have been\u2014Mao Zedong reportedly told journalist [[Edgar Snow]] in 1965 that China had no intention of fighting to save the Hanoi regime and would not engage the US military unless it crossed into Chinese territory. On other occasions, Mao expressed confidence that the People's Liberation Army could take on the US again, much like it did in Korea. Whatever Chinese plans might have been, the Johnson Administration was unwilling to tempt fate and so US ground troops never crossed into North Vietnam.<ref>Kwan Ha Yim, ''China & the US, 1964-72'' (1975) pp 57-82.</ref><ref> Frank E.

The United States placed an embargo on trading with the PRC, and encouraged allies to follow it. The [[596 (nuclear test)|PRC developed nuclear weapons]] in 1964 and, as later declassified documents revealed, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] considered preemptive attacks to halt its nuclear program. He ultimately decided the measure carried too much risk and it was abandoned.\n\nFor most of the 22 years between 1949 and 1971, Sino-US relations were uniformly hostile, with Mao Zedong frequently referring to the United States as \"the most dangerous imperialist power\",{{Quote without source|date=April 2018}} and the U.S. frequently attacked by Chinese propaganda. President Kennedy believed that US policy towards China was \"nonsensical\",{{Quote without source|date=April 2018}} and he considered reestablishing diplomatic ties in his second term.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} However, Kennedy's assassination in late 1963, followed by the Vietnam War and Cultural Revolution, ended any possibility of normalized relations with Beijing for years.\n\nDespite this official non-recognition, the United States and the People's Republic of China held 136 meetings at the ambassadorial level beginning in 1954 and continuing until 1970, first in [[Geneva]] and in 1958\u20131970 in Warsaw.<ref>Steven M.

American companies were reluctant to invest in China despite (future Chairman) Deng Xiaoping's reassurances of a stable business environment.<ref>Pamela G.

For China, when American president Johnson decided to wind down the Vietnam war in 1968, it gave China an impression that the US had no interest of expanding in Asia anymore while the USSR became a more serious threat as [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|it intervened in Czechoslovakia]] to displace a communist government and might well interfere in China.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dunbabin|first=J.P.D.|title=International relations since 1945|year=1996|publisher=Longman|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-582-49365-0|page=255|edition=[Nachdr.].}}</ref>\n\nThis became an especially important concern for the People's Republic of China after the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] of 1969. The PRC was diplomatically isolated and the leadership came to believe that improved relations with the United States would be a useful counterbalance to the Soviet threat. [[Zhou Enlai]], the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of China]], was at the forefront of this effort with the committed backing of Chairman Mao Zedong. In 1969, the United States initiated measures to relax trade restrictions and other impediments to bilateral contact, to which China responded. However, this rapprochement process was stalled by the Vietnam War where China was supporting the enemies of the United States. Communication between Chinese and American leaders, however, was conducted through [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[Pakistan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nixonfoundation.org/exhibit/the-opening-of-china/|title=The Week that Chenged the World|website=Richard Nixon Foundation|date=2017-01-18}}</ref> and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] as intermediaries.\n\n[[File:Kissinger Mao.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Kissinger, Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong' Kissinger made two secret trips to the PRC in 1971 before Nixon's groundbreaking visit in 1972.]]\n\nIn the United States, academics such as [[John K. Fairbank]] and [[A. Doak Barnett]] pointed to the need to deal realistically with the Beijing government, while organizations such as the [[National Committee on United States\u2013China Relations]] sponsored debates to promote public awareness. Many saw the specter of Communist China behind communist movements in [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]], but a growing number concluded that if the PRC would align with the US it would mean a major redistribution of global power against the Soviets. Mainland China's market of nearly one billion consumers appealed to American business. Senator [[J. William Fulbright]], Chair of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], held a series of hearings on the matter.<ref>Goh, Evelyn, ''Constructing the US Rapprochement with China, 1961\u20131974: From 'Red Menace' to 'Tacit Ally' '', Cambridge University Press, 2005</ref>\n \nRichard M. Nixon mentioned in his [[First inauguration of Richard Nixon|inaugural address]] that the two countries were entering an era of negotiation after an era of confrontation. Although Nixon during his 1960 presidential campaign had vociferously supported Chiang Kai-Shek, by the second half of the decade, he increasingly began to speak of there \"being no reason to leave China angry and isolated\". Nixon's election as president in 1968 was initially met with hostility by Beijing\u2014an editorial in the ''People's Daily'' denounced him as \"a chieftain whom the capitalist world had turned to out of desperation\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Leffler|first=edited by Melvyn P.|title=The Cambridge history of the Cold War.|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-83720-0|page=373|edition=1. publ.|author2=Westad, Odd Arne}}</ref> Nixon believed it was in the American national interest to forge a relationship with China, even though there were enormous differences between the two countries.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dube|first=Clayton|title=Getting to Beijing: Kissinger's Secret 1971 Trip|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2483|publisher=USC US-China Institute|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>  He was assisted in this by his [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]]. Domestic politics also entered into Nixon's thinking, as the boost from a successful courting of the PRC could help him in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 American presidential election]]. He also worried that one of the Democrats would preempt him and go to the PRC before he had the opportunity.\n\nIn 1971, an unexpectedly friendly encounter between the American and Chinese ping-pong athletes called [[Glenn Cowan]] and [[Zhuang Zedong]] in Japan opened the way for a visit to China, which Chairman Mao personally approved.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dube|first=Clayton|title=Sports diplomacy and back channel negotiations|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2470|work=Talking Points, July 22 \u2013 August 3, 2011|publisher=USC US-China Institute|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>  In April 1971, the athletes became the first Americans to officially visit China since the communist takeover. The smooth acceptance of this so-called \"[[ping-pong diplomacy]]\" gave confidence to both sides. In July 1971, Henry Kissinger feigned illness while on a trip to Pakistan and did not appear in public for a day. He was actually on a top-secret mission to Beijing to negotiate with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai.\n\nKissinger and his aides did not receive a warm welcome in Beijing, and the hotel they stayed in was equipped with pamphlets excoriating US imperialism. However, the meeting with Zhou Enlai was productive, and the Chinese premier expressed his hope for improved Sino-US relations. He commented that the US had intentionally isolated China, not vice versa, and any initiative to restore diplomatic ties had to come from the American side. Zhou spoke of the late President Kennedy's plans to restore relations with China and told Kissinger \"We are willing to wait as long as we need to. If these negotiations fail, in time another Kennedy or another Nixon will come along.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kisslibrary.com/book/7138CDB42A74355EA5B6?search=2011+American+Business+in+China+White+Paper&a_aid=ddmidovv&a_bid=11110007|title=2011 American Business in China White Paper by American Chamber of Commerce in China / KissLibrary: Affordable Ebooks|website=kisslibrary.com|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\nOn July 15, 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] revealed the mission to the world and that he had accepted an invitation to visit the PRC.<ref>Magaret MacMillan, ''Nixon and Mao: The Week That Changed The World'' (2008)</ref>\n\nThis announcement<ref>{{cite web|last=Nixon|first=Richard|title=Announcement of the President's Trip to China|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2258|work=US-China documents collection|publisher=USC US-China Institute|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>  caused immediate shock around the world. In the United States, some hard-line anti-communists (most notably Arizona Senator [[Barry Goldwater]]) denounced the decision, but most public opinion supported the move and Nixon saw the jump in the polls he had been hoping for. Since Nixon had sterling anti-communist credentials he was all but immune to being called \"soft on communism.\" Nixon and his aides wanted to ensure that press coverage offered dramatic imagery.<ref>See [http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2705 \"Getting to know you: The US and China shake the world\"] and [http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2672 \"The Week that Changed the World\"] for recordings, documents, and interviews.</ref> Nixon was particularly eager for strong news coverage.\n\n[[File:President and Mrs. Nixon visit the Great Wall of China and the Ming tombs - NARA - 194421.tif|thumb|right|President Nixon and First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] walk with the American delegation and their Chinese hosts on the [[Great Wall of China]].]]\n[[File:Nixon and Zhou toast.jpg|thumb|right|President Nixon and Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] toast during Nixon's 1972 visit to China]]\nWithin the PRC there was also opposition from left-wing elements. This effort was allegedly led by [[Lin Biao]], head of the military, who died in a mysterious plane crash over [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]] while trying to defect to the Soviet Union. His death silenced most internal dissent over the visit.\n\nInternationally, reactions varied. In the communist world, the Soviets were very concerned that two major enemies seemed to have resolved their differences, and the new world alignment contributed significantly to the policy of ''[[d\u00e9tente]]''. Romania's president [[Nicolai Ceausescu|Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] praised the US initiative as a \"move for world peace\".{{Quote without source|date=April 2018}} Several communist regimes, including Cuba, Albania, and North Vietnam, accused China of \"capitulationism to the imperialists\".{{Quote without source|date=April 2018}} North Korea proclaimed that it was the reverse and that the US had been forced to capitulate to China, having failed to isolate it.\n\nAmerica's European [[NATO|allies]] and [[Canada]] were pleased by the initiative, especially since many of them had already recognized the PRC. In [[Asia]], the reaction was far more mixed. [[Japan]] was annoyed that it had not been told of the announcement until fifteen minutes before it had been made, and feared that the Americans were abandoning them in favor of the PRC. A short time later, Japan also recognized the PRC and committed to substantial trade with the continental power. [[South Korea]] and [[South Vietnam]] were both concerned that peace between the United States and the PRC could mean an end to American support for them against their communist enemies. Throughout the period of rapprochement, both countries had to be regularly assured that they would not be abandoned.\n\nFrom February 21 to February 28, 1972, President Nixon [[1972 Nixon visit to China|traveled]] to [[Beijing]], [[Hangzhou]], and [[Shanghai]]. At the conclusion of his trip, the US and the PRC issued the [[Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9]], a statement of their respective foreign policy views. In the Communiqu\u00e9, both nations pledged to work toward the full normalization of diplomatic relations. This did not lead to immediate recognition of the People's Republic of China but 'liaison offices' were established in Beijing and Washington.<ref name=\"Dunbabin 1996 258\">{{cite book|last=Dunbabin|first=J.P.D.|title=International relations since 1945|year=1996|publisher=Longman|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-582-49365-0|page=258|edition=[Nachdr.].}}</ref> The US acknowledged the PRC position that all Chinese on both sides of the [[Taiwan Strait]] maintain that [[One-China policy|there is only one China]] and that Taiwan is part of China. The statement enabled the US and PRC to temporarily set aside the issue of Taiwan and open trade and communication. Also, the US and China both agreed to take action against 'any country' that is to establish 'hegemony' in the Asia-Pacific. On several issues, such as the ongoing conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and Israel, the US and China were unable to reach a common understanding.<ref name=\"Dunbabin 1996 258\"/>\n\nMost major anti-US propaganda disappeared in China after the Nixon visit; although there was still occasional criticism of US imperialism, the Soviet Union had definitively become China's arch-foe in the 1970s.\n\nThe rapprochement with the United States benefited the PRC immensely and greatly increased its security for the rest of the [[Cold War]]. It has been argued that the United States, on the other hand, saw fewer benefits than it had hoped for, inasmuch as China continued to back America's enemies in Hanoi and Pyongyang. Eventually, however, the PRC's suspicion of Vietnam's motives led to a break in Sino-Vietnamese cooperation and, upon the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1979, the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]]. Both China and the United States backed combatants in [[Africa]] against Soviet and [[Cuba]]n-supported movements. The economic benefits of normalization were slow as it would take decades for American products to penetrate the vast Chinese market. While Nixon's China policy is regarded by many as the highlight of his presidency, others such as [[William Bundy]] have argued that it provided very little benefit to the United States.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Liaison Office (1973\u20131978)===\n[[File:President Ford makes remarks in the People's Republic of China - NARA - 7062599.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Gerald Ford]] makes remarks at a Reciprocal Dinner in Beijing on December 4, 1975.]]\n\nIn May 1973, in an effort to build toward formal diplomatic relations, the US and the PRC established the [[United States Liaison Office]] (USLO) in Beijing and a counterpart PRC office in Washington.

Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, Carter's National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], and senior staff member of the National Security Council [[Michel Oksenberg]] encouraged Carter to seek full diplomatic and trade relations with China. Although Brzezinski sought to quickly establish a security relationship with Beijing to counter the Soviet Union, Carter sided with Vance in believing that such a deal would threaten existing U.S.-Soviet relations, including the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II]] negotiations.

Taiwan, although fully expecting this step, nonetheless expressed disappointment at having not been consulted first. The reaction of the communist world was similar to 1972, with the Soviet Union and its allies in Eastern Europe mostly being noncommittal, Romania welcoming the move, and Cuba and Albania being strongly against it. North Korea issued a statement congratulating \"our brotherly neighbors for ending long-hostile relations with the US\".{{Quote without source|date=April 2018}}\n\nVice Premier [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s [[1979 visit by Deng Xiaoping to the United States|January 1979 visit]] to Washington initiated a series of important, high-level exchanges which continued until the spring of 1989. This resulted in many bilateral agreements, especially in the fields of scientific, technological, and cultural interchange, as well as trade relations.

In 1983, the US State Department changed its classification of China to \"a friendly, developing nation\",{{Quote without source|date=April 2018}} thereby increasing the amount of technology and armaments that could be sold. The skepticism of some US Congressmen was not entirely unmerited as China during the 1980s continued to sell arms to [[Iran]] and other states that were openly hostile to American interests.\n\n[[File:Carter DengXiaoping (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Deng Xiaoping with [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]]]\nAs a consequence of high-level and working-level contacts initiated in 1980, New York City and Beijing become sister cities, US dialogue with the PRC broadened to cover a wide range of issues, including global and regional strategic problems, political-military questions, including arms control, UN, and other multilateral organization affairs, and international narcotics matters.<ref>Michel Oksenberg, \"Reconsiderations: A Decade of Sino-American Relations.\" ''Foreign Affairs'' 61.1 (1982): 190.</ref>\n\nHigh-level exchanges continued to be a significant means for developing US\u2013PRC relations in the 1980s. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and Premier [[Zhao Ziyang]] made reciprocal visits in 1984. Reagan's visit to Beijing went well, however a speech he made criticizing the Soviet Union and praising capitalism, democracy, and freedom of religion was not aired on Chinese state TV. In July 1985, Chinese President [[Li Xiannian]] traveled to the United States, the first such visit by a PRC head of state. Vice President Bush visited the PRC in October 1985 and opened the US Consulate General in [[Chengdu]], the US's fourth consular post in the PRC. Further exchanges of cabinet-level officials occurred between 1985 and 1989, capped by President Bush's visit to Beijing in February 1989.\n\n[[File:Zhao Ziyang cropped.jpg|left|150px|thumb|President [[Ronald Reagan]] walking with Premier [[Zhao Ziyang]] during his visit to the White House on 10 January 1984.]]\n\nShortly after being elected president in 1980, Ronald Reagan made a speech criticizing the PRC and welcoming restoration of ties with Taiwan. These remarks aroused initial panic in Beijing, but Reagan's advisers quickly apologized for his comments, and the president-elect soon retracted them.\n\nReagan's first two years in office saw some deterioration in Sino-US relations due to the president's vociferous anti-communism, as well as the inability of the two nations to come to a common understanding over the Korean standoff, the Israel\u2013Palestine conflict, or the Falkland War. In 1982, Deng Xiaoping, in a reiteration of Mao Zedong's \"Three Worlds\" theory, criticized both the US and Soviet Union for imperialism. In 1983, there were quarrels over a Chinese tennis player, Hu Na, who defected to the US, and over an incident where an Olympic parade float in New York City displayed the flag of Taiwan rather than the PRC's flag.\n\nIn the period before the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], a growing number of cultural exchange activities gave the American and Chinese peoples broad exposure to each other's cultural, artistic, and educational achievements. Numerous mainland Chinese professional and official delegations visited the United States each month. Many of these exchanges continued after the suppression of the Tiananmen protests.<ref>Robert Suettinger, ''Beyond Tiananmen: The Politics of US-China Relations, 1989\u20132000'' (Brookings Institution Press, 2004).</ref>\n\n===Taiwan issue===\nSince the renewal of Sino-American relations in early 1979, the Taiwan issue remained a major source of contention.

The expanding relationship that followed normalization was threatened in 1981 by PRC objections to the level of US arms sales to the Republic of China on Taiwan. Secretary of State [[Alexander Haig]] visited China in June 1981 in an effort to resolve Chinese concerns about America's unofficial relations with Taiwan. Vice President Bush visited the PRC in May 1982. Eight months of negotiations produced the US-PRC Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of August 17, 1982. In this third communiqu\u00e9, the US stated its intention to gradually reduce the level of arms sales to the Republic of China, and the PRC described as a fundamental policy their effort to strive for a peaceful resolution to the [[political status of Taiwan|Taiwan question]]. China's Ambassador to Washington, in an interview with [[CGTN (TV channel)|CGTN]] in April 2018, is quoted as saying that Sino-American relations hinge largely upon the US-PRC Joint Communiqu\u00e9 signed between the two parties and where the USA had agreed not to challenge the PRC's sovereignty over the island of Taiwan, but to respect China's \"anti-secession law,\" until such time that Taiwan will be reunified with the Mainland.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giBRQ1q1yJg Dialogue: Interview with China's Ambassador to the US], [[CGTN (TV channel)|CGTV]], 4 April 2018 (minutes: 16:22\u201320:13).</ref> When the Trump administration came to power, contention over the Taiwan issue intensified; President Trump became the first sitting US president since Jimmy Carter in 1979 to have any formal political or diplomatic contacts with Taiwan when he decided to receive a phone call from president Tsai Ing-Wen.

In addition, American warships have reportedly crossed the Taiwan strait and increased military drills with Taiwan, which mainland China views as a direct threat to its sovereignty.

The United States dispatched two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region. Subsequently, tensions in the Taiwan Strait diminished and relations between the US and the PRC improved, with increased high-level exchanges and progress on numerous bilateral issues, including human rights, [[nuclear proliferation]], and trade. China's leader [[Jiang Zemin]] visited the United States in the fall of 1997, the first state visit to the US by a [[President of the People's Republic of China|PRC president]] since 1985 and the first visit to the US by a [[paramount leader]] since 1979. In connection with that visit, the two sides came to a consensus on implementation of their 1985 agreement on Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation, as well as a number of other issues.<ref>U.Hawaii, 1997</ref> President Clinton visited the PRC in June 1998. He traveled extensively in mainland China, and had direct interaction with the Chinese people, including live speeches and a radio show which allowed the President to convey a sense of American ideals and values. President Clinton was criticized by some, however, for failing to pay adequate attention to human rights abuses in mainland China.<ref>Eckholm</ref>\n\nRelations were damaged for a time by the [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]] in May 1999, which was stated by the White House to be miscoordination between intelligence and the military, although which some Chinese believed to be deliberate. In any case, Beijing for several days was rocked by massive anti-US demonstrations. By the end of 1999, relations began to gradually improve. In October 1999, the two countries reached an agreement on compensation for families of those who were victims, as well as payments for damages to respective diplomatic properties in [[Belgrade]] and China. Sino-US relations in 1999 were also damaged by accusations that a Chinese-American scientist at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] had given US nuclear secrets to Beijing.\n\nIn April 2001, a PRC [[Shenyang J-8|J-8 fighter jet]] collided with a US [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3]] reconnaissance aircraft flying south of the PRC in what became known as the [[Hainan Island incident]]. The EP-3 was able to make an emergency landing on PRC's [[Hainan|Hainan Island]] despite extensive damage; the PRC aircraft crashed with the loss of its pilot, Wang Wei. The crew were detained by the PLA after destroying all classified documents pertaining to the aircraft's operation. It was widely believed that the EP-3 recon aircraft was conducting a spying mission on the PLA before the collision, which however took place over international waters. Following extensive negotiations resulting in the \"letter of the two sorries,\" the crew of the EP-3 was released from imprisonment and allowed to leave the PRC eleven days later. The US aircraft was returned by Beijing three months later in pieces, after which the relationship between the US and the PRC gradually improved once more.\n\n===George W.

The PRC, itself troubled by Muslim separatists in Xinjiang, offered strong public support for the [[War on Terror]] in [[APEC China 2001]]. The PRC voted in favor of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373|UNSCR 1373]], publicly supported the coalition campaign in [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/china/29871.htm |title=U.S. State Department \u2013 China (03/03) |publisher=state.gov |accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref> and contributed $150 million of bilateral assistance to Afghan reconstruction following the defeat of the [[Taliban]]. Shortly after 9/11, the US and PRC also commenced a counterterrorism dialogue. The third round of that dialogue was held in Beijing in February 2003.\n\nIn the United States, the terrorist attacks greatly changed the nature of discourse. It was no longer plausible to argue, as the [[Blue Team (U.S. politics)|Blue Team]] had earlier asserted, that the PRC was the primary security threat to the United States, and the need to focus on the [[Middle East]] and the [[War on Terror]] made the avoidance of potential distractions in East Asia a priority for the United States.\n\nThere were initial fears among the PRC leadership that the war on terrorism would lead to an anti-PRC effort by the US, especially as the US began establishing bases in [[Central Asia]]n countries like [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]] and renewed efforts against [[Iraq]]. Because of setbacks in America's Iraq campaign, these fears have largely subsided. The application of American power in Iraq and continuing efforts by the United States to cooperate with the PRC has significantly reduced the popular anti-Americanism that had developed in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe PRC and the US have also worked closely on regional issues, including those pertaining to [[North Korea]] and its [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons program]]. The People's Republic of China has stressed its opposition to North Korea's decision to withdraw from the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]], its concerns over North Korea's nuclear capabilities, and its desire for a non-nuclear [[Korean Peninsula]]. It also voted to refer North Korea's noncompliance with its [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] obligations to the UN Security Council.\n\nTaiwan remains a volatile issue, but one that remains under control. The United States policy toward Taiwan has involved emphasizing the [[Four Noes and One Without]]. On occasion the United States has rebuked Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian for provocative pro-independence rhetoric. However, in 2005, the PRC passed the [[Anti-Secession Law]] which stated that the PRC would be prepared to resort to \"non-peaceful means\" if Taiwan declared formal independence. Many critics of the PRC, such as the Blue Team, argue that the PRC was trying to take advantage of the US war in Iraq to assert its claims on Republic of China's territory. In 2008, Taiwan voters elected Ma Ying-jeou. Ma, representing the Kuomintang, campaigned on a platform that included rapprochement with mainland China. His election has significant implications for the future of cross-strait relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=986 |title=US-China Institute :: news & features :: usci symposium explores the taiwan vote |publisher=China.usc.edu |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref>\n\nChina's paramount leader Hu Jintao visited the United States in April 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=442 |title=Text of Pres.

Mainland China has increasingly become the last link in a long chain of value-added production. Because US trade data attributes the full value of a product to the final assembler, mainland Chinese value added is overcounted.\n*US demand for labor-intensive goods exceeds domestic output: the PRC has restrictive trade practices in mainland China, which include a wide array of barriers to foreign goods and services, often aimed at protecting [[state-owned enterprise]]s. These practices include high [[tariff]]s, lack of transparency, requiring firms to obtain special permission to import goods, inconsistent application of laws and regulations, and leveraging technology from foreign firms in return for market access. Mainland China's accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] is meant to help address these barriers.\n*The undervaluation of the [[Renminbi]] relative to the [[United States dollar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/01/data/weorept.aspx?sy=2004&ey=2007&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=924&s=PPPEX&grp=0&a=&pr1.x=62&pr1.y=9 |title=''World Economic Outlook Database, April 2007'' |publisher=Imf.org |date=2006-09-14 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 2009, the US and China agreed to hold regular high-level talks about economic issues and other mutual concerns by establishing the [[Strategic Economic Dialogue]], which meets biannually.

In ''New Mutants'' #7, his father is described as a very driven man, who \"grew up [...] a barefoot houseboy\", \"by age 20 [...] a millionaire [and] by 30, an economic and political force to be reckoned with.\" Emmanuel constantly pushes his son to reach for both his physical and intellectual limits. Thanks to his father's encouragement, Roberto rose to the position of star [[soccer]] player at school<ref name=MGN4>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #4</ref> and was considered by recruiters for the [[Olympic Games]].\n\nWhen Roberto was playing a soccer game with his team, racist members of the opposing team assaulted him, and Roberto responded by initiating a fight on the field. While taking a brutal beating, his mutant powers manifested, suddenly transforming him into a creature of solid black solar energy. Surprised and terrified, people abandoned the stadium, and only his girlfriend Juliana refused to abandon him.<ref name=MGN4 />\n\n===New Mutants===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Marfan027sun.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Sunspot in his original outfit from ''Marvel Fanfare #27''.

In [[Miami, Florida]], the team crash a charity gala only to discover that the wealthy CEO's were kidnapped and replaced by robots. During the battle, the team manages to defeat and capture the Golden Skull, who was wearing a golden armored suit. Danielle then goes back to her timeline with the Golden Skull as her prisoner.

He is also able to create thermal updrafts for flight, project heat and light, as well as concussive blasts of solar energy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> At will, he is able to take on a superhuman \"powered up\" form that is entirely nonreflective black, save for his eyes which turn a solid bright white. Though the color black optimizes solar absorption, he absorbs solar power at all times, not only when he is in his \"powered up\" form. If he has not absorbed sufficient amounts of solar energy in normal form, he will be too weak to \"power up\". Likewise, when not in direct sunlight, use of his superhuman strength rapidly exhausts the stores of energy within his body.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Bruce |title=The New Mutants: From Superhero Spin-Off to Sci-Fi/Fantasy|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29 |page=63|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>\n\nWhen in his solar form, Sunspot also has a [[solar corona|corona]] effect, an aura that has been depicted in multiple ways, though two predominant conventions exist for its portrayal: one is that the air close to him manifests black globes of various sizes, reminiscent of [[Kirby dots]], and the other is a unified field glowing a bright yellow or white.  Although Sunspot can absorb energy from stars and reflected solar energy from the moon, the amounts that reach him on Earth are too minuscule to add significantly to his power. In other regions, such as [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], his power is significantly enhanced, allowing him - with much effort - to lift [[Volstagg]] off the ground for a few seconds before suffering a backache.<ref>''New Mutants Special Edition'' #1 (Dec. 1985)</ref>\n\nOriginally, Sunspot's superhuman power was limited solely to superhuman strength and enhanced durability, and then only in his solar form. Unlike many superhumanly strong heroes, Sunspot was unique in that his physical resistance to impact only increased somewhat when he employed his superhuman strength, and he was not bulletproof by any means. The phrase, \"Careful Bobby, you're strong, not invulnerable!\" or variations was seen many times. In addition, Sunspot's powers have radically changed and grown since the character was introduced; he can now withstand the force of a speeding eighteen-wheeler traveling at speeds of 100&nbsp;mph. Alongside surviving an A.I.M explosive charge latched onto his side.<ref>''Avengers World'' Vol. 1 #18</ref>\n\nSunspot maintained his original powerset for roughly the first ten years of his existence, remaining a super strong but vulnerable individual throughout the entire ''New Mutants'' series. During the mid-1990s in ''X-Force'' his powers began to change, under writer [[Fabian Nicieza]]. Nicieza had the supervillain Gideon capture Roberto and subject him to experimentation where the limits of Roberto's power absorption were tested by feeding him immense amounts of solar power. Roberto was rescued by X-Force, but the overload had permanently altered his powers in such a way that he was now able to release concussive blasts of solar energy, with a considerable heat and light projection component; this experimentation also made him immune to all types of heat and fire. He can also now absorb other forms of energy; such as heat, light or even radiation in a manner similar to photo/radio- or thermokinesis, It was believed they do not power up his abilities but this was proven false.<ref>''Hulk'' Vol 3 #3</ref><ref name=\"Avengers World Vol. 1 #19\">''Avengers World'' Vol. 1 #19</ref> Sunspot also has some capacity to manipulate light based energy effects, but it remains a largely unexplored portent of his mutant power.<ref name=\"Avengers World Vol. 1 #19\"/> It has been debated that Roberto would have reached these levels of his abilities of his own accord, and that Gideon's experimentation only increased his evolution process.\n\nThe fact that the solar blasts were concussive in origin led directly into ''X-Force'' #28, where Sunspot thinks of using them as a means of propulsion, and thus fly by blasting in the opposite direction of where he wanted to go \u2013 initially leaving a slight trail behind him, but in later years, Roberto would learn to use the propulsion more subtly \u2013 to appear to hover in place with no blast wake at all other than his usual \"powered up\" corona effect. His capacity to fly has similarly been enhanced as he is able to breach planetary orbit and reach Saturn's belt with relative ease.<ref>''Hulk'' Vol 3 #3-4</ref>\n\nSunspot also had the rituals and ideas of the [[Askani]] inside his head, due to a telepathic contact with Cable. While being strongly influenced by it for a while, the memories seem to have faded.\n\nSignificant non-superhuman abilities include business administration, as he owns and runs a multibillion-dollar international conglomerate. He is an Olympic-class athlete as the result of having been trained in combat by the X-Men and later by Cable. He is an expert in many languages (see below) and has an assortment of other more minor talents such as piloting aircraft. He was trained in swordsmanship by the Gladiators, and is also an excellent soccer player.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nSunspot was in the X-Ternals with [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[Strong Guy]], and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]].

Roberto da Costa is an angry vigilante mutant of Brazilian descent. Originally came from Harlem in this continuity, he sees the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] as decadent [[Uncle Tom]] figures and has accused them of living in an ivory tower, considering themselves separate from \"second-class muties\" like himself. He also harbors a deep hatred for [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and his followers because of the anti-mutant hysteria that followed the Brooklyn Bridge's destruction at the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]'s hands.{{Issue|date=March 2010}}\n\nAfterward he has joined Emma Frost's [[New Mutants|Academy of Tomorrow]], a school for gifted beings. Initially, Roberto is confused as he knows his grades are not impressive.

He is approached by Alex Summers (Polaris's boyfriend) and is convinced to help assist in breaking Lorna out. He works with [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]. The team relies on Roberto's knowledge of New York City, but because Roberto had rarely been ''outside'' of Harlem, this reliance results in the team becoming lost. During this time, the X-Men attack them, and Roberto is subdued and removed from the fight.{{issue|date=March 2016}}\n\nMagneto has him killed in Ultimatum along with the rest of the Academy of Tomorrow except for [[Havok (comics)|Havok]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Sunspot is murdered in an attack.{{Issue|date=March 2010}} He is buried on the grounds of the [[X-Mansion]].<ref>''[[Ultimate Requiem]]''</ref>\n\n===What If?===\nIn \"What if Some of the X-Men Had Stayed In Asgard?\", Sunspot is one of the X-Men and New Mutants members who choose to remain in Asgard.

[[Robert Maverick|Red Hulk]] crash-landed into the floating volcanic island base, hard enough to destroy it.

In [[Miami, Florida]], the team crash a charity gala only to discover that the wealthy CEO's were kidnapped and replaced by robots. During the battle, the team manages to defeat and capture the Golden Skull, who was wearing a golden armored suit. Danielle then goes back to her timeline with the Golden Skull as her prisoner. Sunspot then sends Red Hulk to confront and defeat an out-of-control American Kaiju, who was attacking [[Europe]].<ref>''U.S. Avengers'' #2-4</ref>\n\nDuring the \"Opening Salvo\" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Captain America, whose memory was altered by Red Skull's clone using the powers of [[Kobik]], has a meeting with Roberto da Costa and tells him that he is no longer in charge of the team.

After restoring order to the planet, the heroes head home.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #12</ref>\n\n===[[War of the Realms]]===\n\nAfter the Age of X-Man removes most X-Men members to an alternate reality, Sunspot reappears to assist [[Dani Moonstar|Mirage]] and the remaining X-Men repel Malekith's invasion of Midgard.<ref>Uncanny X-Men: War of the Realms #2 (2019)</ref> In a ploy to allow [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] to teleport the invading horde to Limbo, he breaks a cursed amulet blocking her powers, and in doing so, is vaporized, joining the fallen Valkyries in their journey to the afterlife.<ref>Uncanny X-Men: War of the Realms #3 (2019)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[Image:XMEN SunspotPowerup.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sunspot's energized state.<br/>''New Mutants'' #6<br/>Art by [[Diogenes Neves]].]]\nSunspot is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] whose cells have the ability to absorb [[solar energy]] and convert it for use as physical strength. He is also able to create thermal updrafts for flight, project heat and light, as well as concussive blasts of solar energy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> At will, he is able to take on a superhuman \"powered up\" form that is entirely nonreflective black, save for his eyes which turn a solid bright white. Though the color black optimizes solar absorption, he absorbs solar power at all times, not only when he is in his \"powered up\" form. If he has not absorbed sufficient amounts of solar energy in normal form, he will be too weak to \"power up\". Likewise, when not in direct sunlight, use of his superhuman strength rapidly exhausts the stores of energy within his body.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Bruce |title=The New Mutants: From Superhero Spin-Off to Sci-Fi/Fantasy|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29 |page=63|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>\n\nWhen in his solar form, Sunspot also has a [[corona]] effect, an aura that has been depicted in multiple ways, though two predominant conventions exist for its portrayal: one is that the air close to him manifests black globes of various sizes, reminiscent of [[Kirby dots]], and the other is a unified field glowing a bright yellow or white.  Although Sunspot can absorb energy from stars and reflected solar energy from the moon, the amounts that reach him on Earth are too minuscule to add significantly to his power. In other regions, such as [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], his power is significantly enhanced, allowing him - with much effort - to lift [[Volstagg]] off the ground for a few seconds before suffering a backache.<ref>''New Mutants Special Edition'' #1 (Dec. 1985)</ref>\n\nOriginally, Sunspot's superhuman power was limited solely to superhuman strength and enhanced durability, and then only in his solar form. Unlike many superhumanly strong heroes, Sunspot was unique in that his physical resistance to impact only increased somewhat when he employed his superhuman strength, and he was not bulletproof by any means. The phrase, \"Careful Bobby, you're strong, not invulnerable!\" or variations was seen many times. In addition, Sunspot's powers have radically changed and grown since the character was introduced; he can now withstand the force of a speeding eighteen-wheeler traveling at speeds of 100&nbsp;mph. Alongside surviving an A.I.M explosive charge latched onto his side.<ref>''Avengers World'' Vol. 1 #18</ref>\n\nSunspot maintained his original powerset for roughly the first ten years of his existence, remaining a super strong but vulnerable individual throughout the entire ''New Mutants'' series. During the mid-1990s in ''X-Force'' his powers began to change, under writer [[Fabian Nicieza]]. Nicieza had the supervillain Gideon capture Roberto and subject him to experimentation where the limits of Roberto's power absorption were tested by feeding him immense amounts of solar power. Roberto was rescued by X-Force, but the overload had permanently altered his powers in such a way that he was now able to release concussive blasts of solar energy, with a considerable heat and light projection component; this experimentation also made him immune to all types of heat and fire. He can also now absorb other forms of energy; such as heat, light or even radiation in a manner similar to photo/radio- or thermokinesis, It was believed they do not power up his abilities but this was proven false.<ref>''Hulk'' Vol 3 #3</ref><ref name=\"Avengers World Vol. 1 #19\">''Avengers World'' Vol. 1 #19</ref> Sunspot also has some capacity to manipulate light based energy effects, but it remains a largely unexplored portent of his mutant power.<ref name=\"Avengers World Vol. 1 #19\"/> It has been debated that Roberto would have reached these levels of his abilities of his own accord, and that Gideon's experimentation only increased his evolution process.\n\nThe fact that the solar blasts were concussive in origin led directly into ''X-Force'' #28, where Sunspot thinks of using them as a means of propulsion, and thus fly by blasting in the opposite direction of where he wanted to go \u2013 initially leaving a slight trail behind him, but in later years, Roberto would learn to use the propulsion more subtly \u2013 to appear to hover in place with no blast wake at all other than his usual \"powered up\" corona effect. His capacity to fly has similarly been enhanced as he is able to breach planetary orbit and reach Saturn's belt with relative ease.<ref>''Hulk'' Vol 3 #3-4</ref>\n\nSunspot also had the rituals and ideas of the [[Askani]] inside his head, due to a telepathic contact with Cable. While being strongly influenced by it for a while, the memories seem to have faded.\n\nSignificant non-superhuman abilities include business administration, as he owns and runs a multibillion-dollar international conglomerate. He is an Olympic-class athlete as the result of having been trained in combat by the X-Men and later by Cable. He is an expert in many languages (see below) and has an assortment of other more minor talents such as piloting aircraft. He was trained in swordsmanship by the Gladiators, and is also an excellent soccer player.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nSunspot was in the X-Ternals with [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[Strong Guy]], and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]. Like [[Robin Hood]], they take money from [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and give to the poor. [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] assigns them to travel to the [[Shi'ar]] Galaxy to steal the powerful [[M'Kraan Crystal]].<ref>''Gambit and the X-Ternals'' #1\u20134 (1995\u201396)</ref> Sunspot dies after absorbing too much energy in an attempt to help his teammates escape.{{issue|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Days of Future Now===\nIn this reality, Sunspot is shown as the leader of the [[Gene Nation]].{{Issue|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Mutant X===\nSunspot is part of a murderous team of '[[Marauders (comics)#Mutant X|Marauders]]', which consists of [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], and [[Husk (comics)|Husk]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Sunspot a.k.a. Roberto da Costa is an angry vigilante mutant of Brazilian descent. Originally came from Harlem in this continuity, he sees the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] as decadent [[Uncle Tom]] figures and has accused them of living in an ivory tower, considering themselves separate from \"second-class muties\" like himself. He also harbors a deep hatred for [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and his followers because of the anti-mutant hysteria that followed the Brooklyn Bridge's destruction at the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]'s hands.{{Issue|date=March 2010}}\n\nAfterward he has joined Emma Frost's [[New Mutants|Academy of Tomorrow]], a school for gifted beings. Initially, Roberto is confused as he knows his grades are not impressive. Emma assures him that grades (or even mutant powers) do not always classify a person as 'gifted'.{{Issue|date=March 2010}} Soon after Roberto is accepted into the school, he is in trouble: fellow student [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Lorna Dane]] is framed and imprisoned for the murder of several dozen people.  He is approached by Alex Summers (Polaris's boyfriend) and is convinced to help assist in breaking Lorna out. He works with [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]. The team relies on Roberto's knowledge of New York City, but because Roberto had rarely been ''outside'' of Harlem, this reliance results in the team becoming lost. During this time, the X-Men attack them, and Roberto is subdued and removed from the fight.{{issue|date=March 2016}}\n\nMagneto has him killed in Ultimatum along with the rest of the Academy of Tomorrow except for [[Havok (comics)|Havok]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Sunspot is murdered in an attack.{{Issue|date=March 2010}} He is buried on the grounds of the [[X-Mansion]].<ref>''[[Ultimate Requiem]]''</ref>\n\n===What If?===\nIn \"What if Some of the X-Men Had Stayed In Asgard?\", Sunspot is one of the X-Men and New Mutants members who choose to remain in Asgard.

A tropical version of chestnut trees can reach 20\u201330 m with fruits or seeds half the size of the Chinese version. It is edible and taste like ''C. mollissima''. It is found in Malaysia and perhaps other Southeast Asian countries, as well. Perhaps because its seeds are relatively small, it is not commercially cultivated. \n* The European chestnut, ''[[Castanea sativa]]'' (sweet chestnut; also called \"Spanish chestnut\" in the US and the UK), is the only European species of chestnut, though it was successfully introduced to the [[Himalayas]] and other temperate parts of Asia. \n\nThe unrelated [[Horse chestnut]]s (genus ''Aesculus'') are not true chestnuts but are named for producing nuts of similar appearance that are mildly poisonous to humans. Nor should they be confused with [[Eleocharis dulcis|water chestnut]]s, which are tubers of an aquatic herbaceous plant in the sedge family [[Cyperaceae]].<ref name=answers/><ref name=chestnutbrook/>\nOther species commonly mistaken for chestnut trees are the chestnut oak (''[[Quercus prinus]]'') and the American beech (''[[Fagus grandifolia]]''),<ref name=chestnuttree>[http://www.chestnuttree.net/ Chestnut Tree] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705113403/http://www.chestnuttree.net/ |date=July 5, 2008 }} in chestnuttree.net.</ref><ref name=nzcouncil/> both of which are also in the Fagaceae.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Japanese Chestnut01.jpg|thumb|Female chestnut flowers]]\n[[File:Japanese Chestnut02.jpg|thumb|Male chestnut flowers]]\nThe name \"chestnut\" is derived from an earlier English term \"chesten nut\", which descends from the Old French word ''chastain'' (Modern French, ''ch\u00e2taigne'').<ref>{{OEtymD|chestnut}}</ref> The French word in turn derives from [[Latin]] ''Castanea'' (also the scientific name of the tree), which traces to the [[Ancient Greek]] word \u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (sweet chestnut).<ref name=rhs>''New RHS Dictionary of Gardening''.

In Hungary, it swarms in chestnut [[orchard]]s around August 20, particularly strongly around noon and in sunny weather. The eggs are laid into the [[Calybium and cupule|cupule]]s or around the [[peduncle (botany)|peduncle]] joints. The larvae feed on the nuts and leave only nutchips and excrement within. While the chestnuts ripen, the larvae retreat into the ground after having chewed their way out of the nuts. The following July, they turn into [[pupa]]e. <br> The larvae of the chestnut weevil can only chew their way out of a fallen nut, so breeding occurs mostly where chestnuts lie on the ground for a sufficient length of time, or where the trees produce many small fruits which remain behind at the harvest. Timing the harvests to pick up the chestnuts as soon as they fall reduces the numbers of the [[overwinter]]ing larvae. Regular soil work is also unfavourable to its life habits. Small [[Grafting|grafts]] are sprayed with chemicals. A warm, aerosol-based protection has been developed for older trees, by Sifter and B\u00fcrg\u00e9s in 1971. Planting chestnut orchards beside [[Quercus cerris|turkey oak]] forests is not advised, because both trees are susceptible to the chestnut weevil (which also uses the turkey oak acorn to develop), and the turkey oak trees can pass it on to the chestnut trees.<ref name=szenti/>\n* In Hungary, the most common moth threatening chestnut trees is the [[Tortricidae|acorn moth]] (''Laspeyreisa splendana'') and its subspecies. Its grayish-yellow larvae cause similar damage to that of the chestnut weevil, but they spin characteristic webs among the nutchips and larval excrement. This moth causes about 5\u201341% of the damage that occurs in western Hungary's plantations. Plantations need regular protection against these moths, the occurrence of which does not decrease.<ref name=szenti/>\n* In New Zealand, the grass grub beetle eats the soft, new-season foliage. They can entirely strip a young tree in the late spring, when they fly at dusk, often in huge numbers.<ref name=nzcouncil/>\n\n===Diseases===\n* [[Chestnut blight]] fungus (''Cryphonectria parasitica'') (formerly ''Endothia parasitica'') affects chestnut trees. The Eastern Asian species have coevolved with this disease and are moderately to very resistant to it, while the European and North American species, not having been exposed to it in the past, have little or no resistance.<ref name=rhs/> Early in the 20th century, chestnut blight destroyed about four billion American chestnut trees,<ref name=\"acfh\"/> and reduced the most important tree throughout the East Coast to an insignificant presence. The American chinkapins are also very susceptible to chestnut blight. The European and West Asian chestnuts are susceptible, but less so than the American species.<ref name=rhs/> The resistant species (particularly Japanese and Chinese chestnut, but also Seguin's chestnut and Henry's chestnut) have been used in breeding programs in the U.S. to create [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] with the American chestnut that are also disease-resistant.<ref name=rhs/> <br>The bark miner ''Spulerina simploniella'' (Lepidoptera: Gracilariidae) was found in intensively managed chestnut [[Coppicing|coppices]] in Greece, but not in orchards. The larvae (and the rain) may be agents in the spread of the disease. They mine under the thin periderm of young trees up to 10 years old, while the stem bark is still smooth. Rain during the pupation period (around the last week of May and first two weeks of June), and the actions of the larvae, may collude for [[Conidium|conidiospores]] to come into contact with the freshly exposed [[phloem]], thus causing cankers.<ref name=nagref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118712634/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 ''The role of Spulerina simploniella in the spread of Chestnut blight'']{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}.

The disease attacks the phloem tissue and the [[cambium (botany)|cambium]] of the [[root]]s and root collars about 10\u201320&nbsp;cm above ground. [[Wet rot]] settles in as a result. It was named after the ink-black color of the [[tannic acid]] becoming ([[Redox|oxidized]]) after seeping out, but that symptom is not a characteristic of only that disease. The same ink-black color can appear following other types of [[Decomposition|decays]] and mechanical injuries that make liquids seep through; these liquids can also oxidize after contact with air. Moreover, with some phytophthoric diseases, no tannic acid is generated. With the ink disease, the leaves turn yellow and later fall off; the fruits remain small, and the nuts prematurely drop out of the burrs. These dry and remain on the trees throughout winter. In acute cases, root decay makes the trees dry out and wither away.<ref name=szenti/> It is caused by ''[[Phytophthora cambivora]]'' and ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]''.<ref name=\"Robin\">{{cite journal|last=Robin|first=C\u00e9cile |author2=Olivier Morel |author3=Anna-Maria Vettraino |author4=Charikleia Perlerou |author5=Stephanos Diamandis |author6=Andrea Vannini|date=1 May 2006|title=Genetic variation in susceptibility to Phytophthora Cambivora in European chestnut (Castanea sativa) |journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=226|issue=1\u20133|pages=199\u2013207|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2006.01.035}}</ref>\n* ''Phytophthora'' disease is the longest-known chestnut tree disease leading to tree death. Of the two main [[pathogen]]s for this disease, the one in European chestnuts is known since 1971 to be ''[[Phytophthora cambivora]]''. ''[[Phytophthora cinnamoni]]'' was discovered in chestnut trees in the United States in 1932. Both trigger similar symptoms. Since then, it has also been shown to occur in most European chestnut-growing countries. Differentiating between the two pathogens is difficult. Chemicals seem of little effectiveness. Many countries impose strict [[Prophylaxis|prophylactic]] rules to prevent the spread of the disease.<ref name=szenti/>\n* ''Melanconis modonia'' can infect trees through injuries and induce \"bark death\". It was first reported in Hungary by Hausz in 1972. The damage is of little consequence in older or stronger trees, but it affects sapling graftings in nurseries. ''Coryneum perniciosum'', one of the two [[conidium]]-like side forms of this fungus, occurs on all decayed, [[lignin|ligneous]] parts of a chestnut tree. The symptoms of infection on young, smooth trunks is similar to that of the chestnut blight fungus ''Cryphonectria''. For this reason, it has persistently been wrongly thought of as the pathogen for ink disease. With ''Melanconis'', the bark sinks in and takes on brownish-red tones, with black, lentil-like multicell conidium bodies and black cone-like [[Thylakoid|stromata]] breaking through the bark. Unlike with ''Cryphonectria'', though, no orange-colored fruiting bodies are seen. Prevention primarily includes keeping trees in good shape; some further protections against ''Cryphonectria'' also help prevent bark death caused by ''Melanconis''.<ref name=szenti/>\n* Chestnut mosaic virus is probably transmitted by the oak aphid ''Myzocallis castanicola''.<ref name=\"ctifl\"/>\n* [[Root rot]] is caused by the [[honey fungus]] ''Armillaria mellia''. When planting ''Castanea'', recently cleared land is best avoided to help resist this fungus.<ref name=laren60/> The disease is more prevalent on heavier and poorly drained soil types.<ref name=nzcouncil/>\n* [[Leaf spot]] is the most common disease for chestnut trees (''Mycosphaerella maculiformis''). It is known as ''cylindrosporium'' leaf spot disease, after its summer conidium form ''Cylindrosporium castaneae''. The pathogens spend the winter in the white spots of the fallen leaves. At spring time, it reinfects the new leaves. In or near June, tiny white spots on the leaves appear, which grow and turn brown over time. At the end of the summer, the spots entirely cover the leaf, which turns yellow. In rainy and humid weather with large temperature fluctuation, the tree loses its leaves. If August is dry and warm, the infected leaves roll up, the arteries twist, and the dead leaves dry on the tree until defoliage. This recurs yearly, though the extent of the damage varies from year to year. Some species are more resistant than others.<ref name=szenti/>\n* Oak mildew is among several foliage diseases of smaller significance for European chestnut growing. It infects the most trees (''Microsphaera alphitoides''). Younger trees suffer most; their shoots become short-jointed, growth is delayed, and they develop sensitivity to frostbite. In older trees, the fungus usually infects only the tip of the shoots. The pathogens hibernate in the shoots and infect the leaves from there. The fungus grows on the top of the leaves, with the appearance of a coating only in midsummer. The infected leaves' development slows down or stops, the distance between their [[Vascular tissue|vessels]] shrinks, and the vessels themselves become curly.<ref name=szenti/>\n* In storage rot, breaking the tuft provides the most common entrance for fungal [[spore]]s during storage. ''Cyboria'', the most diffuse, turns the flesh black and spongy. Other fungi are known, such as ''Rhizopus'', ''Fusarium'', and ''[[Colletotrichum]]''.<ref name=fao/> In chestnuts, Colletotrichum disease symptoms may also be called '''blossom end rot'''. Browning of the chestnut burs at the blossom end may be a first sign in August. At harvest time, blackening of pointed end of the chestnut shell and kernel indicates infection. The extent of blackening can vary. It can range from a barely visible black tip of the kernel to the whole nut being black. Parts of the nut kernel with no color change remain edible.<ref>Greg Miller, Blossom End Rot of Chestnut: A Small Problem Becomes a Big Problem, The Chestnut Grower, Winter 2017</ref>\n\n===Coppicing===\nMost chestnut wood production is done by [[coppice]] systems, cut on a 12-year rotation to provide small timber which does not split as badly as large logs.<ref name=edlin/> In southern England (particularly in [[Kent]]), sweet chestnut has traditionally been grown as coppices, being recut every 10 years or so on rotation for poles used for firewood, [[fencing]] (fence posts and chestnut paling), and especially to support the strings up when [[hops]] are grown.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Sustainable forest management===\nAn excellent soil-enriching understory<ref name=botanical/> in [[pine]] forests,<ref name=rhs/><ref name=pfaf/>\n[[sustainable forest management]] incorporates more mixed plantings of proven efficiency, as opposed to monosylviculture. A study presented in 1997 has evaluated positively the potential increase in productivity with mixed stands and plantations, compared to plots of only one species. The relative yield total values of the mixed plantings steadily increase with time. ''C. sativa'' responds well to competitive pressure from ''Pseudotsuga menziesii'', the latter also showing a higher productivity.<ref name=\" salesmonteiro\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090108183227/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T6X-3VJRRSB-11&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=9938875c5feac45071595ecd5adf3b50 ''Dynamics of a broadleaved (Castanea sativa) conifer (Pseudotsuga menziesii) mixed stands in Northern Portugal''].

Cooked chestnuts, either whole, chopped, or pureed, may be frozen in an airtight container and held up to 9 months.

In Hungary, it swarms in chestnut [[orchard]]s around August 20, particularly strongly around noon and in sunny weather. The eggs are laid into the [[Calybium and cupule|cupule]]s or around the [[peduncle (botany)|peduncle]] joints. The larvae feed on the nuts and leave only nutchips and excrement within. While the chestnuts ripen, the larvae retreat into the ground after having chewed their way out of the nuts. The following July, they turn into [[pupa]]e. <br> The larvae of the chestnut weevil can only chew their way out of a fallen nut, so breeding occurs mostly where chestnuts lie on the ground for a sufficient length of time, or where the trees produce many small fruits which remain behind at the harvest. Timing the harvests to pick up the chestnuts as soon as they fall reduces the numbers of the [[overwinter]]ing larvae. Regular soil work is also unfavourable to its life habits. Small [[Grafting|grafts]] are sprayed with chemicals. A warm, aerosol-based protection has been developed for older trees, by Sifter and B\u00fcrg\u00e9s in 1971. Planting chestnut orchards beside [[Quercus cerris|turkey oak]] forests is not advised, because both trees are susceptible to the chestnut weevil (which also uses the turkey oak acorn to develop), and the turkey oak trees can pass it on to the chestnut trees.<ref name=szenti/>\n* In Hungary, the most common moth threatening chestnut trees is the [[Tortricidae|acorn moth]] (''Laspeyreisa splendana'') and its subspecies. Its grayish-yellow larvae cause similar damage to that of the chestnut weevil, but they spin characteristic webs among the nutchips and larval excrement. This moth causes about 5\u201341% of the damage that occurs in western Hungary's plantations. Plantations need regular protection against these moths, the occurrence of which does not decrease.<ref name=szenti/>\n* In New Zealand, the grass grub beetle eats the soft, new-season foliage. They can entirely strip a young tree in the late spring, when they fly at dusk, often in huge numbers.<ref name=nzcouncil/>\n\n===Diseases===\n* [[Chestnut blight]] fungus (''Cryphonectria parasitica'') (formerly ''Endothia parasitica'') affects chestnut trees. The Eastern Asian species have coevolved with this disease and are moderately to very resistant to it, while the European and North American species, not having been exposed to it in the past, have little or no resistance.<ref name=rhs/> Early in the 20th century, chestnut blight destroyed about four billion American chestnut trees,<ref name=\"acfh\"/> and reduced the most important tree throughout the East Coast to an insignificant presence. The American chinkapins are also very susceptible to chestnut blight. The European and West Asian chestnuts are susceptible, but less so than the American species.<ref name=rhs/> The resistant species (particularly Japanese and Chinese chestnut, but also Seguin's chestnut and Henry's chestnut) have been used in breeding programs in the U.S. to create [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] with the American chestnut that are also disease-resistant.<ref name=rhs/> <br>The bark miner ''Spulerina simploniella'' (Lepidoptera: Gracilariidae) was found in intensively managed chestnut [[Coppicing|coppices]] in Greece, but not in orchards. The larvae (and the rain) may be agents in the spread of the disease. They mine under the thin periderm of young trees up to 10 years old, while the stem bark is still smooth. Rain during the pupation period (around the last week of May and first two weeks of June), and the actions of the larvae, may collude for [[Conidium|conidiospores]] to come into contact with the freshly exposed [[phloem]], thus causing cankers.<ref name=nagref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118712634/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 ''The role of Spulerina simploniella in the spread of Chestnut blight'']{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}.

The disease attacks the phloem tissue and the [[cambium (botany)|cambium]] of the [[root]]s and root collars about 10\u201320&nbsp;cm above ground. [[Wet rot]] settles in as a result. It was named after the ink-black color of the [[tannic acid]] becoming ([[Redox|oxidized]]) after seeping out, but that symptom is not a characteristic of only that disease. The same ink-black color can appear following other types of [[Decomposition|decays]] and mechanical injuries that make liquids seep through; these liquids can also oxidize after contact with air. Moreover, with some phytophthoric diseases, no tannic acid is generated. With the ink disease, the leaves turn yellow and later fall off; the fruits remain small, and the nuts prematurely drop out of the burrs. These dry and remain on the trees throughout winter. In acute cases, root decay makes the trees dry out and wither away.<ref name=szenti/> It is caused by ''[[Phytophthora cambivora]]'' and ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]''.<ref name=\"Robin\">{{cite journal|last=Robin|first=C\u00e9cile |author2=Olivier Morel |author3=Anna-Maria Vettraino |author4=Charikleia Perlerou |author5=Stephanos Diamandis |author6=Andrea Vannini|date=1 May 2006|title=Genetic variation in susceptibility to Phytophthora Cambivora in European chestnut (Castanea sativa) |journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=226|issue=1\u20133|pages=199\u2013207|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2006.01.035}}</ref>\n* ''Phytophthora'' disease is the longest-known chestnut tree disease leading to tree death. Of the two main [[pathogen]]s for this disease, the one in European chestnuts is known since 1971 to be ''[[Phytophthora cambivora]]''. ''[[Phytophthora cinnamoni]]'' was discovered in chestnut trees in the United States in 1932. Both trigger similar symptoms. Since then, it has also been shown to occur in most European chestnut-growing countries. Differentiating between the two pathogens is difficult. Chemicals seem of little effectiveness. Many countries impose strict [[Prophylaxis|prophylactic]] rules to prevent the spread of the disease.<ref name=szenti/>\n* ''Melanconis modonia'' can infect trees through injuries and induce \"bark death\". It was first reported in Hungary by Hausz in 1972. The damage is of little consequence in older or stronger trees, but it affects sapling graftings in nurseries. ''Coryneum perniciosum'', one of the two [[conidium]]-like side forms of this fungus, occurs on all decayed, [[lignin|ligneous]] parts of a chestnut tree. The symptoms of infection on young, smooth trunks is similar to that of the chestnut blight fungus ''Cryphonectria''. For this reason, it has persistently been wrongly thought of as the pathogen for ink disease. With ''Melanconis'', the bark sinks in and takes on brownish-red tones, with black, lentil-like multicell conidium bodies and black cone-like [[Thylakoid|stromata]] breaking through the bark. Unlike with ''Cryphonectria'', though, no orange-colored fruiting bodies are seen. Prevention primarily includes keeping trees in good shape; some further protections against ''Cryphonectria'' also help prevent bark death caused by ''Melanconis''.<ref name=szenti/>\n* Chestnut mosaic virus is probably transmitted by the oak aphid ''Myzocallis castanicola''.<ref name=\"ctifl\"/>\n* [[Root rot]] is caused by the [[honey fungus]] ''Armillaria mellia''. When planting ''Castanea'', recently cleared land is best avoided to help resist this fungus.<ref name=laren60/> The disease is more prevalent on heavier and poorly drained soil types.<ref name=nzcouncil/>\n* [[Leaf spot]] is the most common disease for chestnut trees (''Mycosphaerella maculiformis''). It is known as ''cylindrosporium'' leaf spot disease, after its summer conidium form ''Cylindrosporium castaneae''. The pathogens spend the winter in the white spots of the fallen leaves. At spring time, it reinfects the new leaves. In or near June, tiny white spots on the leaves appear, which grow and turn brown over time. At the end of the summer, the spots entirely cover the leaf, which turns yellow. In rainy and humid weather with large temperature fluctuation, the tree loses its leaves. If August is dry and warm, the infected leaves roll up, the arteries twist, and the dead leaves dry on the tree until defoliage. This recurs yearly, though the extent of the damage varies from year to year. Some species are more resistant than others.<ref name=szenti/>\n* Oak mildew is among several foliage diseases of smaller significance for European chestnut growing. It infects the most trees (''Microsphaera alphitoides''). Younger trees suffer most; their shoots become short-jointed, growth is delayed, and they develop sensitivity to frostbite. In older trees, the fungus usually infects only the tip of the shoots. The pathogens hibernate in the shoots and infect the leaves from there. The fungus grows on the top of the leaves, with the appearance of a coating only in midsummer. The infected leaves' development slows down or stops, the distance between their [[Vascular tissue|vessels]] shrinks, and the vessels themselves become curly.<ref name=szenti/>\n* In storage rot, breaking the tuft provides the most common entrance for fungal [[spore]]s during storage. ''Cyboria'', the most diffuse, turns the flesh black and spongy. Other fungi are known, such as ''Rhizopus'', ''Fusarium'', and ''[[Colletotrichum]]''.<ref name=fao/> In chestnuts, Colletotrichum disease symptoms may also be called '''blossom end rot'''. Browning of the chestnut burs at the blossom end may be a first sign in August. At harvest time, blackening of pointed end of the chestnut shell and kernel indicates infection. The extent of blackening can vary. It can range from a barely visible black tip of the kernel to the whole nut being black. Parts of the nut kernel with no color change remain edible.<ref>Greg Miller, Blossom End Rot of Chestnut: A Small Problem Becomes a Big Problem, The Chestnut Grower, Winter 2017</ref>\n\n===Coppicing===\nMost chestnut wood production is done by [[coppice]] systems, cut on a 12-year rotation to provide small timber which does not split as badly as large logs.<ref name=edlin/> In southern England (particularly in [[Kent]]), sweet chestnut has traditionally been grown as coppices, being recut every 10 years or so on rotation for poles used for firewood, [[fencing]] (fence posts and chestnut paling), and especially to support the strings up when [[hops]] are grown.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Sustainable forest management===\nAn excellent soil-enriching understory<ref name=botanical/> in [[pine]] forests,<ref name=rhs/><ref name=pfaf/>\n[[sustainable forest management]] incorporates more mixed plantings of proven efficiency, as opposed to monosylviculture. A study presented in 1997 has evaluated positively the potential increase in productivity with mixed stands and plantations, compared to plots of only one species. The relative yield total values of the mixed plantings steadily increase with time. ''C. sativa'' responds well to competitive pressure from ''Pseudotsuga menziesii'', the latter also showing a higher productivity.<ref name=\" salesmonteiro\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090108183227/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T6X-3VJRRSB-11&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=9938875c5feac45071595ecd5adf3b50 ''Dynamics of a broadleaved (Castanea sativa) conifer (Pseudotsuga menziesii) mixed stands in Northern Portugal''].

The RXTE had three instruments\u2014an All Sky Monitor, the Proportional Counter Array, and the High-Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE).  The RXTE observed X-rays from [[black holes]], [[neutron stars]], [[X-ray pulsars]] and [[X-ray bursts]]. It was funded as part of the [[Explorer program]], and is sometimes also called Explorer 69.\n\nRXTE had a mass of 3200&nbsp;kg and was launched from [[Cape Canaveral]] on 30 December 1995 on a [[Delta (rocket)|Delta]] rocket.  Its [[International Designator]] is [https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1995-074A 1995-074A].\n\nObservations from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer have been used as evidence for the existence of the [[frame-dragging]] effect predicted by the theory of [[general relativity]].  RXTE results have, as of late 2007, been used in more than 1400 scientific papers.\n\nIn January 2006, it was announced that Rossi had been used to locate a candidate [[intermediate-mass black hole]] named M82 X-1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/dying_star_reveals_more_evidence_for_new_kind_of_black_hole_9685 |title=Dying Star Reveals More Evidence for New Kind of Black Hole |publisher=ScienceBlog.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}</ref>  In February 2006, data from RXTE was used to prove that the diffuse background X-ray glow in our galaxy comes from innumerable, previously undetected [[white dwarf]]s and from other stars' [[stellar corona|coronae]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://skyandtelescope.com/news/article_1681_1.asp |title=\nGalactic Glow Gleaned}}</ref> In April 2008, RXTE data was used to infer the size of the smallest known black hole.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA Scientists Identify Smallest Known Black Hole | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2008/smallest_blackhole.html | date=2008-04-01}}</ref>\n\nRXTE ceased science operations on 3 January 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=The RXTE Mission is Approaching the End of Science Operations | url=http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/xhp_new.html#endofoperations | date=2012-01-04}}</ref>\n\nNASA scientists said that the decommissioned RXTE would re-enter the Earth's atmosphere \"between 2014 and 2023\".<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA's ageing black hole-stalking probe switched off | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/01/11/rxte_satellite/ | date=2012-01-11}}</ref>  Later it became clear that the satellite would re-enter in late April or early May 2018,<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA FAQ: RXTE Spacecraft Re-entry|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/nasa-frequently-asked-questions-rxte-spacecraft-re-entry|publisher=NASA|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref> and the spacecraft fell out of orbit on April 30, 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/40592-nasa-rxte-satellite-falls-to-earth.html|title=A Pioneering NASA Satellite Just Fell to Earth After 2 Decades in Space|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref>\n\n== Instruments ==\n[[File:XTE launch.gif|thumb|right|XTE launches]]\n\n=== All-Sky Monitor (ASM) ===\nThe ASM consisted of three wide-angle shadow cameras equipped with proportional counters with a total collecting area of 90 square cm.

The RXTE had three instruments\u2014an All Sky Monitor, the Proportional Counter Array, and the High-Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE).  The RXTE observed X-rays from [[black holes]], [[neutron stars]], [[X-ray pulsars]] and [[X-ray bursts]]. It was funded as part of the [[Explorer program]], and is sometimes also called Explorer 69.\n\nRXTE had a mass of 3200&nbsp;kg and was launched from [[Cape Canaveral]] on 30 December 1995 on a [[Delta (rocket)|Delta]] rocket.  Its [[International Designator]] is [https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1995-074A 1995-074A].\n\nObservations from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer have been used as evidence for the existence of the [[frame-dragging]] effect predicted by the theory of [[general relativity]].  RXTE results have, as of late 2007, been used in more than 1400 scientific papers.\n\nIn January 2006, it was announced that Rossi had been used to locate a candidate [[intermediate-mass black hole]] named M82 X-1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/dying_star_reveals_more_evidence_for_new_kind_of_black_hole_9685 |title=Dying Star Reveals More Evidence for New Kind of Black Hole |publisher=ScienceBlog.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}</ref>  In February 2006, data from RXTE was used to prove that the diffuse background X-ray glow in our galaxy comes from innumerable, previously undetected [[white dwarf]]s and from other stars' [[corona]]e.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://skyandtelescope.com/news/article_1681_1.asp |title=\nGalactic Glow Gleaned}}</ref> In April 2008, RXTE data was used to infer the size of the smallest known black hole.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA Scientists Identify Smallest Known Black Hole | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2008/smallest_blackhole.html | date=2008-04-01}}</ref>\n\nRXTE ceased science operations on 3 January 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=The RXTE Mission is Approaching the End of Science Operations | url=http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/xhp_new.html#endofoperations | date=2012-01-04}}</ref>\n\nNASA scientists said that the decommissioned RXTE would re-enter the Earth's atmosphere \"between 2014 and 2023\".<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA's ageing black hole-stalking probe switched off | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/01/11/rxte_satellite/ | date=2012-01-11}}</ref>  Later it became clear that the satellite would re-enter in late April or early May 2018,<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA FAQ: RXTE Spacecraft Re-entry|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/nasa-frequently-asked-questions-rxte-spacecraft-re-entry|publisher=NASA|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref> and the spacecraft fell out of orbit on April 30, 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/40592-nasa-rxte-satellite-falls-to-earth.html|title=A Pioneering NASA Satellite Just Fell to Earth After 2 Decades in Space|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref>\n\n== Instruments ==\n[[File:XTE launch.gif|thumb|right|XTE launches]]\n\n=== All-Sky Monitor (ASM) ===\nThe ASM consisted of three wide-angle shadow cameras equipped with proportional counters with a total collecting area of 90 square cm.
