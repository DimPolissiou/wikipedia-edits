In 2001, [[UNESCO]] declared it one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].\n\n==Origins==\nTwo stories exist regarding the date of creation of the ''Misteri d'Elx''. The older account, which placed its origin in the 13th century, was put forth by Cristobal Sanz in his history of the city written at the beginning of the 17th century. After confessing that he was unable to prove his history, he proposed that the earliest inhabitants of the city had celebrated it in 1276. He also adds another older story: after the conquest of the city by [[James I of Aragon|James I the Conqueror]] in 1265, the inhabitants of the city conceived the idea of a [[mystery play]] on the day the city was retaken from the [[Moors]].\n\nIn 1717, Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3n, Attorney General of the Marquisate of Elche, also supported the theory and added a miraculous element: the arrival on the beaches of Elche of a mysterious ark in May 1266. The box contained the image of the Virgin of the Assumption that is today enshrined in the basilica and the ''Consueta'', a document containing the script and occasionally the music of the play. This story was maintained in part to excuse a possible mistake of the composer, [[\u00d3scar Espl\u00e1]] (1886\u20131976), who asserted that in 1924, he had been shown a letter of 1266 authorizing the play. This letter was allegedly preserved in the Municipal Archives of Elche, despite the fact that it has never been seen since or even cited. The work carried out by Espl\u00e1, and his importance as a composer, revived the theory of the play's origin in the 13th century.\n\nSince the end of the 19th century when historians first arrived at Elche and studied the play, the date of its composition was given a ''[[terminus ante quem]]'' sometime around the turn of 15th century. At present, most scholars from  multiple disciplines (literary, theatrical, musical, linguistics, iconographic, etc.) agree to it composition in the latter half of the 15th century, without emphasizing any precedents in existence in the city.\n\n==Scene==\nThe play is performed within the Basilica, and the stage comprises several areas and devices:\n\n===The Heaven===\nThe great linen, located at the height of the ring of the basilica's dome, fulfills the double function of representing the sky and concealing mechanisms that permit the ascent and descent of aerial stage devices. It is possibly as old as the current play, since older stage directions from as early as 1530 already seem to indicate its presence.\n\nThe linen acts as a divider between celestial and earthly actions, and possesses a peephole towards the choir called the \"Door to Heaven\". The Door is a square aperture that is opened and closed three times during the play in order to admit aerial stage devices.\n\n===''La Magrana''===\n[[Image:Misterio de Elche, La Mangrana.JPG|thumb|300px|''La Magrana'' partway through the Door to Heaven during ''La Vespra''.]]\nThis aerial device, called ''la magrana'' (\"the [[pomegranate]]\"), transports the first Angel who delivers the golden palm frond to Mary, and shows her the way to heaven. In its current form, the device dates the second half of the 16th century. Both its structure and its name are reminiscent of period mechanisms commonly used in Spain, such as [[Decorative boxes|boxes]], [[globe]]s, and [[armillary sphere]]s.\n\nUntil recently, the term \u201cpomegranate\u201d was thought to be quite modern, with the term \u201ccloud\u201d considered to be more ancient and correct. This was thought to have been the result of the device's supposedly having changed in colour from an older blue to red. Modern research, however, suggests that the name was already used in the 16th century, possibly because the current, more compact and sturdy device replaced a less substantial structure made of cotton, paper, and fabric.\n\n===The Araceli===\nThe Araceli is the second aerial device to appear, and enters the scene on two occasions. It is first used by five angels who fetch Mary's soul (in the form of a statuette) to Heaven; four of the angels sing as the central angel (often a priest) bears the Virgin's spirit. They appear to the Apostles, who organize a procession to bury her body. Its second appearance is in the great finale, where the fifth angel with Mary's soul is replaced by the full image of Mary. This image is taken into the ceiling and is crowned by the [[Holy Trinity]] at the halfway point of its ascension.\n\nThe Araceli is not a statue unique to the mystery play. It is similar to sculptures made at the end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th.\n\n===''Cadafal''=== \nThis is the platform on which much of the drama takes place. Roughly square in shape and covered in wood, it is raised to conceal the hollow that it contains. There is where some aerial devices descend, where actors change costumes, or disappear into. It is located under the dome and the Heaven, but extends in part into the choir to connect the Sepulchre with the shaft of the Door of Heaven.\n\nIn [[Elche]], the ''Cadafal'' is, in words of Quirante Santacruz, \"Mary's area, which contains the places that are hers exclusively, her house and her tomb. Here, the Virgin experiences all the process of sacralization and glorification that contains the work, it is the only place where celestial personages and earthly people live together\".\n\nThe term \"''cadafal''\" appears early on in the first reports of mystery plays staged within of churches with an invariable meaning: dais or platform where the dramatic action takes place.\n\n===The Corridor===\nThis is the great ramp built on top of the Basilica's main aisle. It rises from the principal door to the ''Cadafal''; two small bays to the each side at the point where it joins the latter provide seating for three [[laity|lay]] organisers and the priest overseeing the play.\n\nIts importance is largely symbolic, primarily because it is the only physical element that converts the entire church into a framework for dramatic actions. Secondarily, the walkway is the road that permits communication between the earthly and the divine, and represents the spiritual road that everyone travels.\n\nDuring the play, the actor playing Mary also travels this path, from the door to the ''Cadafal'', symbolising her total achievement of the Christian ideal of uniting with the Christ through his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].\n\n==Music==\nThe music for the play is contained in the '''''Consueta''''', a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''Consuetudine'' and ''Ordinatio''. These manuscripts of the liturgical ceremonies, which contain precious annotations on stage directions, musical score, and stage devices, date from as early as 1625.\n\n==Performances==\n===Normal===\nAugust 14 is when the first act, known as ''La Vespr\u00e0'' (\"The Vigil\") is performed. As it is the eve of the Feast of the Assumption, it recounts the final hours and [[Death of the Virgin]], when her soul is brought to Heaven leaving her corpse surrounded by the grieving Apostles.\n\nAugust 15 is when the second act, known as ''La Festa'' (\"The Feast\") is staged. It focuses on the burial, Assumption and [[Coronation of Mary|Coronation]] of the Virgin. It begins at 10 o'clock with \"''El Soterrar''\" (\"The Interment\"): this portion takes place in the streets outside the basilica, with a procession of the image of the dead Virgin, the actors, and bands playing songs of ''La Festa''.\n\n====Preparations====\nIn the weeks leading to the staging of the ''Misteri'', several preparatory events occur.\n\nOn August 6, in the Room of the Council, \"''la prova de veus''\" (\"the test of voices\") takes place, to select those who will sing in the ''Misteri''. This shows that Elche's City Council, and not the Church, financially supports the play.\n\nAt 6 o'clock in the evening of August 10, \"''La prova de l'\u00e0ngel''\" (\"the test of the angel\") is conducted inside the basilica. This is when organizers identify children resistant to dizziness and are thus fit to descend and ascend on the aerial stage devices.\n\n===Extraordinary===\nOn 11-13 August, the so-called \"''Assajos generals''\" or extraordinary representations, take place.\n\n==Antisemitism==\nThe play has been criticized for its viciously medieval portrayals of evil Jews, with critic [[David Nirenberg]] asking whether the sponsors ought to remove the racist material as the actors in the [[Oberammergau Passion Play]] have done, and pointing out that the play, which will be broadcast on Facebook for the first time in 2019, violates [[Facebook]]'s hate-speech policy.<ref name=\"Facebook\">{{cite news |first=David |last=Nirenberg |title=Facebook\u2019s Hate Speech Policy and the \u2018Mystery of Elche\u2019 |url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/291497/elche-facebook-hate-speech-policy |accessdate=23 October 2019 |publisher=Tablet Magazine |date=10 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Oberammergau Passion Play]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* ''Misteri d'Elx / Misterio de Elche.

Mid Rhondda were one of the earlier South Wales teams to form, as competition from [[rugby union]] within the [[Rhondda|Rhondda Valleys]] was very strong. The team played in both the [[Southern Football League|Southern]] and [[Welsh Football League|Welsh League]]s, and should have been promoted to the first division of the Southern League after topping the second Division during the 1919\u201320 season. This though was denied them by a restructuring of the league, which in turn saw the club flounder and collapse by 1928.\n\n==Club history==\n\n===The adoption of football in Tonypandy===\nThe Mid Rhondda Ground was built in the early part of the 1910s, as an attempt to form the 'best athletics ground in Wales'.<ref name=\"Young4\">Young (2003) p.4</ref> It was built by the Mid Rhondda Athletic Company, and officially opened on 13 April 1913.<ref name=\"Young4\"/> The company raised \u00a33,000 to complete the venture, and when complete it housed an outer cycle track with an inner field for the promotion of [[association football|football]], [[cricket]] and foot running.<ref name=\"Young4\"/> Although housing large events, such as an annual [[horse show]], there appeared to be little sign of the Athletic Company recouping their outlay, until the committee of the Mid Rhondda Social and Athletic Club decided to embrace professional [[rugby league]] in 1908.<ref name=\"Young5\">Young (2003) p.5</ref>\n\nOn 20 April 1908, the world's first rugby league international between the [[England national rugby league team|England]] and [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] national sides took place on the Mid Rhondda Ground. 15,000 paying spectators turned out to watch an exciting game which Wales won 35\u201318.<ref name=\"Young6\">Young (2003) p.6</ref> The gate receipts were enough to impress the committee to compete in the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] and in 1908, [[Mid-Rhondda RLFC]] were formed, playing not only in the Northern League but also in the [[Welsh League]] and [[Challenge Cup]]. Although the team performed well on the pitch, and hosted international competition from the touring Australia side, the venture was unprofitable.<ref name=\"Young6\"/> The rugby league crowds averaged between 3,000 and 4,000,<ref name=\"Young8\">Young (2003) p.8</ref> but when the Mid Rhondda Ground hosted the 1909 final of the South Wales and Monmouthshire Football cup, a crowd of 8,000 was recorded.<ref name=\"Young8\"/> Association football was traditionally more popular in north Wales, but the cup final between local Rhondda team Ton Pentre F.C. and the newly formed [[Merthyr Town F.C.]] showed the Mid Rhondda Club that \"soccer was the coming game\".<ref name=\"Young8\"/> Mid-Rhondda RLFC folded at the end on the 1908\u201309 season, and plans were put into action to form an association team.\n\n===The Formation of Mid Rhondda F.C.===\nEarly attempts to form a football club were placed on hold when industrial unrest spread through the Rhondda during 1910 and 1911. The coal mining area of the valleys experienced several strikes centred on the Glamorgan Colliery in Llwynypia, neighbouring Tonypandy.<ref name=\"Young8\"/> The events game to a climax in 1911 with the [[Tonypandy riots]], where the town centre was vandalised and looted.\n\nIn 1912, with the events of the previous years settled, an attempt was made to introduce a football team in Tonypandy.<ref name=\"Young9\">Young (2003) p.9</ref> The Mid Rhondda Football Club was set up, and a Board of Directors founded. All were from the Tonypandy area and were a cross section of tradesmen and workers representatives. Amongst the shareholders was [[David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda|D.A. Thomas]], the owner of the Cambrian Combine of collieries, which had been at the heart of the strike just a year prior.<ref name=\"Young9\"/>\n\nThe club applied to join the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] and was accepted even though the club had yet to select a team. With a fortnight to go before the start of the 1912\u201313 season the club was facing closure due to lack of funds, but good press encouraged the promoters to carry on and a week later the team had a manager and enough players for a starting XI.<ref name=\"Young9\"/> The club's swift growth earned them the nickname ''The Mushrooms'', though normally called ''The Mush''.<ref name=\"Young9\"/> Their first season in the Second Division of the Southern League saw them face the first teams of [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea Town]], [[Croydon Common F.C.|Croydon Common]] and [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. Mid Rhondda made a steady if unspectacular start to their professional career, finishing 8th out of 13 teams in their first season.<ref name=\"Twydell35\">Twydell (2001), p.35</ref>\n\nThe promoters were happy with the club's progress in their first season, and over the next few seasons the team were often supported by crowds of over 10,000.<ref name=\"Young11\">Young (2003) p.11</ref> Despite some good figures these crowds were inconsistent. The home clash with [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] in 1913 for example witnessed just 3,000 spectators, leading to financial concerns.<ref name=\"Twydell35\"/> The team finished a respectful 7th in the 1913/14 season, in an expanded league of 16 clubs. The 1914/15 season saw a drop in fortunes with the team winning just 3 of their 12 games and ending 12th from 13.<ref name=\"Twydell35\"/> The club suspended play during the First World War, and the club lay dormant until the first season after the war.<ref name=\"Young11\"/>\n\n===1919\u201320 Season===\nOf all the seasons of the club's existence, 1919\u201320 was the most notable. With more funds available the committee of the Mid Rhondda Club made a decision to push the first team for promotion to the First Division, emulating Cardiff City.<ref name=\"Young11\"/>  They turned to a local ex-international footballer [[Haydn Price]] to manage the team.<ref name=\"Young11\"/>  He joined Mid Rhondda as secretary manager and immediately signed as captain former Aston Villa player, [[Joe Bache]].<ref name=\"Young11\"/> Bache brought experience to the team, but it was the signing of an untested young player from Durham, [[Jimmy Seed]], that would be Haydn's most important signing.<ref name=\"Young11\"/> Seed had started his career as a seventeen-year-old with [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], and showed great potential in the reserves. During the war, Seed was posted to the front and was gassed in the trenches.<ref name=\"Young12\">Young (2003) p.12</ref> On his return to training with Sunderland, he was told that because of lung problems his career was finished.<ref name=\"Young12\"/> Price disagreed and signed Seed.\n{{Quote box\n | quote  =...as soon as I got off the train, I was cheered like as if I was a heavyweight champion of the world, rather than a reject who had been told his footballing days were over.<ref name=\"Young12\"/>\n | source =&nbsp;\u2013 <small>Jimmy Seed describing his reception at Tonypandy after joining Mid Rhondda</small>\n | width  =35%\n | align  =right\n | bgcolor =#B0E0E6\n}}\nSeed played \"non-stop football\" from the time he joined Mid Rhondda, and his lungs appeared to recover. By the end of his first season Seed was signed by [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for \u00a31,000, and enjoyed a long career with both Spurs and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] as well as making five appearances for [[England national football team|England]]. Another notable player on Mid Rhondda's books at this time was future Wales international, [[Dai Collier]].\n\nA highlight of the season was when Mid Rhondda played local rivals [[Ton Pentre F.C.|Ton Pentre]] in a preliminary round of the FA cup. 20,000 spectators watched the game, filling the ground with many more covering the mountainside overlooking the pitch.<ref name=\"Young12\"/> More success was to come when the team won the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Division Two, amassing 37 points over 20 games, losing none and drawing only three games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/MIDRHOND.HTM|title=Club history: Mid Rhondda |work=Football Club History Database|accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref> They then took the [[Welsh Football League|Welsh League]] title, beating Cardiff City into second place, losing just five of the thirty games. They completed the season with a third trophy, beating Barry F.C. 1\u20130 at Merthyr to take the South Wales Cup.<ref name=\"Young13\">Young (2003) p.13</ref>\n\nThe strength of the club at the time is best gauged by the challenge matches the team undertook against Football League clubs.<ref name=\"Young13\"/> Due to the large following the club possessed, they were able to offer incentives to league clubs to travel to Tonypandy. These were teams that normally played [[Bristol]] on the Saturday, then brought their first teams to the Rhondda for a Monday night encounter.<ref name=\"Young13\"/> Crowds in excess of 15,000 and the substantial win bonus that was offered elevated these games above friendlies. These encounters included wins over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] (3\u20131), [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] (2\u20130) and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] (1\u20130) in 1919 and a draw against Tottenham Hotspur and a narrow loss to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] (1\u20132) in 1920.<ref name=\"Young13\"/>\n\n===Club demise===\nThe club and supporters expected continued success for the 1920\u201321 season in the First Division of the Southern League. A new stand was built, and other ground improvements were added, including a press box and a gymnasium.<ref name=\"Young15\">Young (2003) p.15</ref> Then ready for the new season, the Southern League was invited to form a [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] of [[the Football League]]. The current First Division of the Southern League became the new Third Division, and no promotions were accepted. Mid Rhondda remained in the Second Division.<ref name=\"Young15\"/>\n\nFrom this, the team disintegrated.

Mid Rhondda were one of the earlier South Wales teams to form, as competition from [[rugby union]] within the [[Rhondda|Rhondda Valleys]] was very strong. The team played in both the [[Southern Football League|Southern]] and [[Welsh Football League|Welsh League]]s, and should have been promoted to the first division of the Southern League after topping the second Division during the 1919\u201320 season. This though was denied them by a restructuring of the league, which in turn saw the club flounder and collapse by 1928.\n\n==Club history==\n\n===The adoption of football in Tonypandy===\nThe Mid Rhondda Ground was built in the early part of the 1910s, as an attempt to form the 'best athletics ground in Wales'.<ref name=\"Young4\">Young (2003) p.4</ref> It was built by the Mid Rhondda Athletic Company, and officially opened on 13 April 1913.<ref name=\"Young4\"/> The company raised \u00a33,000 to complete the venture, and when complete it housed an outer cycle track with an inner field for the promotion of [[association football|football]], [[cricket]] and foot running.<ref name=\"Young4\"/> Although housing large events, such as an annual [[horse show]], there appeared to be little sign of the Athletic Company recouping their outlay, until the committee of the Mid Rhondda Social and Athletic Club decided to embrace professional [[rugby league]] in 1908.<ref name=\"Young5\">Young (2003) p.5</ref>\n\nOn 20 April 1908, the world's first rugby league international between the [[England national rugby league team|England]] and [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] national sides took place on the Mid Rhondda Ground. 15,000 paying spectators turned out to watch an exciting game which Wales won 35\u201318.<ref name=\"Young6\">Young (2003) p.6</ref> The gate receipts were enough to impress the committee to compete in the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] and in 1908, [[Mid-Rhondda RLFC]] were formed, playing not only in the Northern League but also in the [[Welsh League]] and [[Challenge Cup]]. Although the team performed well on the pitch, and hosted international competition from the touring Australia side, the venture was unprofitable.<ref name=\"Young6\"/> The rugby league crowds averaged between 3,000 and 4,000,<ref name=\"Young8\">Young (2003) p.8</ref> but when the Mid Rhondda Ground hosted the 1909 final of the South Wales and Monmouthshire Football cup, a crowd of 8,000 was recorded.<ref name=\"Young8\"/> Association football was traditionally more popular in north Wales, but the cup final between local Rhondda team Ton Pentre F.C. and the newly formed [[Merthyr Town F.C.]] showed the Mid Rhondda Club that \"soccer was the coming game\".<ref name=\"Young8\"/> Mid-Rhondda RLFC folded at the end on the 1908\u201309 season, and plans were put into action to form an association team.\n\n===The Formation of Mid Rhondda F.C.===\nEarly attempts to form a football club were placed on hold when industrial unrest spread through the Rhondda during 1910 and 1911. The coal mining area of the valleys experienced several strikes centred on the Glamorgan Colliery in Llwynypia, neighbouring Tonypandy.<ref name=\"Young8\"/> The events game to a climax in 1911 with the [[Tonypandy Riots]], where the town centre was vandalised and looted.\n\nIn 1912, with the events of the previous years settled, an attempt was made to introduce a football team in Tonypandy.<ref name=\"Young9\">Young (2003) p.9</ref> The Mid Rhondda Football Club was set up, and a Board of Directors founded. All were from the Tonypandy area and were a cross section of tradesmen and workers representatives. Amongst the shareholders was [[David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda|D.A. Thomas]], the owner of the Cambrian Combine of collieries, which had been at the heart of the strike just a year prior.<ref name=\"Young9\"/>\n\nThe club applied to join the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] and was accepted even though the club had yet to select a team. With a fortnight to go before the start of the 1912\u201313 season the club was facing closure due to lack of funds, but good press encouraged the promoters to carry on and a week later the team had a manager and enough players for a starting XI.<ref name=\"Young9\"/> The club's swift growth earned them the nickname ''The Mushrooms'', though normally called ''The Mush''.<ref name=\"Young9\"/> Their first season in the Second Division of the Southern League saw them face the first teams of [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea Town]], [[Croydon Common F.C.|Croydon Common]] and [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. Mid Rhondda made a steady if unspectacular start to their professional career, finishing 8th out of 13 teams in their first season.<ref name=\"Twydell35\">Twydell (2001), p.35</ref>\n\nThe promoters were happy with the club's progress in their first season, and over the next few seasons the team were often supported by crowds of over 10,000.<ref name=\"Young11\">Young (2003) p.11</ref> Despite some good figures these crowds were inconsistent. The home clash with [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] in 1913 for example witnessed just 3,000 spectators, leading to financial concerns.<ref name=\"Twydell35\"/> The team finished a respectful 7th in the 1913/14 season, in an expanded league of 16 clubs. The 1914/15 season saw a drop in fortunes with the team winning just 3 of their 12 games and ending 12th from 13.<ref name=\"Twydell35\"/> The club suspended play during the First World War, and the club lay dormant until the first season after the war.<ref name=\"Young11\"/>\n\n===1919\u201320 Season===\nOf all the seasons of the club's existence, 1919\u201320 was the most notable. With more funds available the committee of the Mid Rhondda Club made a decision to push the first team for promotion to the First Division, emulating Cardiff City.<ref name=\"Young11\"/>  They turned to a local ex-international footballer [[Haydn Price]] to manage the team.<ref name=\"Young11\"/>  He joined Mid Rhondda as secretary manager and immediately signed as captain former Aston Villa player, [[Joe Bache]].<ref name=\"Young11\"/> Bache brought experience to the team, but it was the signing of an untested young player from Durham, [[Jimmy Seed]], that would be Haydn's most important signing.<ref name=\"Young11\"/> Seed had started his career as a seventeen-year-old with [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], and showed great potential in the reserves. During the war, Seed was posted to the front and was gassed in the trenches.<ref name=\"Young12\">Young (2003) p.12</ref> On his return to training with Sunderland, he was told that because of lung problems his career was finished.<ref name=\"Young12\"/> Price disagreed and signed Seed.\n{{Quote box\n | quote  =...as soon as I got off the train, I was cheered like as if I was a heavyweight champion of the world, rather than a reject who had been told his footballing days were over.<ref name=\"Young12\"/>\n | source =&nbsp;\u2013 <small>Jimmy Seed describing his reception at Tonypandy after joining Mid Rhondda</small>\n | width  =35%\n | align  =right\n | bgcolor =#B0E0E6\n}}\nSeed played \"non-stop football\" from the time he joined Mid Rhondda, and his lungs appeared to recover. By the end of his first season Seed was signed by [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for \u00a31,000, and enjoyed a long career with both Spurs and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] as well as making five appearances for [[England national football team|England]]. Another notable player on Mid Rhondda's books at this time was future Wales international, [[Dai Collier]].\n\nA highlight of the season was when Mid Rhondda played local rivals [[Ton Pentre F.C.|Ton Pentre]] in a preliminary round of the FA cup. 20,000 spectators watched the game, filling the ground with many more covering the mountainside overlooking the pitch.<ref name=\"Young12\"/> More success was to come when the team won the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Division Two, amassing 37 points over 20 games, losing none and drawing only three games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/MIDRHOND.HTM|title=Club history: Mid Rhondda |work=Football Club History Database|accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref> They then took the [[Welsh Football League|Welsh League]] title, beating Cardiff City into second place, losing just five of the thirty games. They completed the season with a third trophy, beating Barry F.C. 1\u20130 at Merthyr to take the South Wales Cup.<ref name=\"Young13\">Young (2003) p.13</ref>\n\nThe strength of the club at the time is best gauged by the challenge matches the team undertook against Football League clubs.<ref name=\"Young13\"/> Due to the large following the club possessed, they were able to offer incentives to league clubs to travel to Tonypandy. These were teams that normally played [[Bristol]] on the Saturday, then brought their first teams to the Rhondda for a Monday night encounter.<ref name=\"Young13\"/> Crowds in excess of 15,000 and the substantial win bonus that was offered elevated these games above friendlies. These encounters included wins over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] (3\u20131), [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] (2\u20130) and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] (1\u20130) in 1919 and a draw against Tottenham Hotspur and a narrow loss to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] (1\u20132) in 1920.<ref name=\"Young13\"/>\n\n===Club demise===\nThe club and supporters expected continued success for the 1920\u201321 season in the First Division of the Southern League. A new stand was built, and other ground improvements were added, including a press box and a gymnasium.<ref name=\"Young15\">Young (2003) p.15</ref> Then ready for the new season, the Southern League was invited to form a [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] of [[the Football League]]. The current First Division of the Southern League became the new Third Division, and no promotions were accepted. Mid Rhondda remained in the Second Division.<ref name=\"Young15\"/>\n\nFrom this, the team disintegrated. Price left for [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] and took five players with him, while the remaining players of the previous season found different clubs.<ref name=\"Young15\"/> This was followed by a national coal strike in 1921 which crippled the South Wales valleys, and the Club was suspended by the [[Football Association of Wales]] for non-payment of debts.<ref name=\"Young15\"/> The club reformed in 1922, mainly thanks to voluntary donations from local miners, but now known as Mid Rhondda United. The club rejoined the Southern League for the 1924\u201325 season and applied for Football League membership in 1925.

This is because [[Flotation (archaeology)|flotation]] data recovery techniques were not in wide use among archaeologists of that era.  The 1979 excavations took 42 samples for flotation analysis (24 from features and 18 from [[Midden|midden]] contexts) and as a result a wide variety of plant remains (wood charcoal, nutshell, maize, seeds and bulbs) were found which contribute immensely to our knowledge of [[Upper Mississippian]] subsistence.<ref name=\"Asch\">{{cite book |last1=Asch |first1=David L. |last2=Sidell |first2=Nancy Asch |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 13: Archaeobotany}}</ref>\n\nPlant analysis of flotation data is based primarily on carbonized remains; on plant material that was burned in a [[fire pit]] or [[hearth]] but not completely consumed.  The carbonized materials are rendered much more resistant to decay and thus are often available for the archaeologist to examine.  Not all of the carbonized plant remains are from food items; some of the small seeds recovered may have been intrusive due to the normal seed dispersal process (i.e. the wind just blew them into the fire).  Plant material that was not carbonized was of course subject to the normal process of decay and would not be available to the archaeologist except under extraordinary conditions.\n\n'''Summary of Findings:'''<ref name=\"Asch\"/>\n\n* [[Wood]] [[charcoal]] - the vast majority of all flotation samples (from 82-95%) were naturally from the wood that was used as firewood.  Each sample showed a great deal of diversity and although [[oak]] and [[hickory]] were dominant, [[maple]], [[ash]], [[American hornbeam]], [[American elm]], [[American hop hornbeam]], [[Populus|poplar]] and [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] were also present.  This mix reflects the trees present in the surrounding [[Deciduous forest|deciduous forests]] and [[Oak savanna|oak savannas]].\n* [[Nutshell]] - was ubiquitous and present in every sample.  [[Hickory nut]] and [[black walnut]] were the dominant species; [[hazelnut]] and [[acorn]] were also present.  Trace amounts of [[Butternut (tree)|butternut]] were present in a few features.\n* [[Maize]] - was the most abundant of the food plant remains.  Kernels, cupules and cob fragments of the 8- or 10-row variety were present in all samples.\n* Cultivated seeds - 80% of all seeds recovered were of [[Chenopodium berlandieri|goosefoot (Chenopodium berlandieri)]], [[Hordeum pusillum|little barley (Hordeum pusillum)]] and [[Polygonum erectum|knotweed (Polygonum erectum)]].  This indicates that the [[Upper Mississippian]] residents were part of the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]] (EAC) of cultivated seed plants that predated the introduction of [[maize]] in parts of [[North America]].  The EAC plants were first identified in [[Middle Woodland]] contexts and their use continued to the early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.\n* Other cultivated plants - [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[sunflower]] and the [[Common bean|common bean]] were also present.\n* [[Wild rice]] - was also present.  There is abundant evidence of Native American utilization of this resource in early Historic accounts.<ref name=\"Blair\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Blair |editor1-first=Emma Helen |title=The Indian Tribes of the Upper Mississippi Valley and Region of the Great Lakes |date=1911-1912 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |edition=1996 reprint}}</ref>\n* Fruit seeds - [[Plum|plum]], [[sumac]], [[grape]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] and [[ground cherry]] were also noted.\n* [[Bulb]] - a carbonized bulb of what appears to be [[Allium|wild onion]] was recovered.\n* Noneconomic seeds - seeds from several plants that are present in small quantities and do not have a food or other economic use are presumed to be intrusive; such as [[Desmodium|Desmodium (ground bulrush)]], [[Galium|Galium (tick trefoil)]], [[Xanthium|Xanthium (cocklebur)]] and [[Hypoxis hirsuta|Hypoxis hirsuta (yellow star-grass)]].  Even these intrusive seeds are useful to the archaeologist, because they can be used to help recreate the environment present at the time of site occupation.  Some of the intrusive seeds present at Oak Forest indicate a moist marshy environment was nearby, and others indicate a habitat of open fields and oak savannas.\n\n=== Animal Remains ===\n\nRemains from several species were recovered from the site.  The main species present were [[deer]] and [[fish]]; also present were [[turtle]], [[dog]], [[bald eagle]], [[sandhill crane]], [[otter]] and others.  These remains were not modified into tools like the bone tools described in the Artifacts section below, and may be considered food remains or, in the case of the dog, the remains of [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] activities.  Dog sacrifice and dog meat consumption was observed to have ceremonial and religious implications in early [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes.<ref name=\"Greenman\">{{cite journal |last1=Greenman |first1=E.F. |title=An Early Historic Cemetery in St. Ignace |journal=The Michigan Archaeologist |date=1958 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=29-30}}</ref>  In addition, bald eagles, sandhill cranes and otters were known to have spiritual significance in historic Native American religious groups/ceremonies such as the [[Midewiwin]].<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n=== Artifacts ===\n\n[[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] recovered from the site included:<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\n* [[Pottery]] - total of 1,270 sherds were recovered in the 1958 excavations, and another 3,347 were recovered in 1979.  The pottery artifacts will be discussed in more detail below.\n* Stone artifacts - including [[Projectile point|projectile points]], [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]] (including humpback scrapers), [[Burin (lithic flake)|gravers]], graver drills, knives, cores, utilized flakes and a chopper.  Of the projectile points, the most numerous category was the small triangular Madison point.\n* Ground stone artifacts - including [[Grinding Stone|grinding stones]], [[Hammerstone|hammerstones]]/[[Mano (stone)|manos]], [[Metate|metates]], abraders and a piece of [[hematite]] that may be a [[rubstone]].  \n* [[Bone]] and [[antler]] tools - including [[scapula]] [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]], an antler [[Wrench|wrench]] and a [[harpoon]].\n* [[Marine shell]] - a unique [[duck]] effigy [[pendant]] made out of [[marine shell]] was present at the site.\n* Early Historic artifacts - in 1958, a single [[iron]] fragment was found which was thought to be an early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] artifact of [[Europe|European]] manufacture.  In 1979 many more such remains were found due largely to the use of [[Flotation (archaeology)|flotation]]; including 2 tubular sheet [[brass]] hair pipes (similar to the [[copper]] specimens found at the [[Dumaw Creek Site|Dumaw Creek site]]<ref name=\"Quimby\">{{cite journal |last1=Quimby |first1=George I. |title=The Dumaw Creek Site |journal=Fieldiana |date=1966 |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=1-91}}</ref>), 3 fragments of crumpled sheet brass, 15 iron pieces (6 nails, 1 bolt, 1 washer, a strap with pendant tabs, 2 sheet fragments and 4 unidentified fragments), and a single white glass [[bead]] similar to those found at [[Iroquois|Iroquoian]] sites in [[Ontario]] and [[New York (state)|New York State]] (where they have been dated to the early 1600s).\n\nThe non-pottery artifacts found at an archaeological site can provide useful cultural context as well as a glimpse into the domestic tasks performed at a site; [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] or [[Religion|religious]] activities; recreational activities; and clothing or personal adornment.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/>\n\nSome of the most prominent and diagnostic non-pottery artifacts are presented here in more detail:<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n!

Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed over cordmarked.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Michalik\">{{cite book |last1=Michalik |first1=Laura K. |last2=Brown |first2=James A. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 10: Ceramic Artifacts}}</ref><ref name=\"Griffin\">{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=James Bennett |title=The Fort Ancient Aspect: Its Cultural and Chronological Position in Mississippi Valley Archaeology |date=1943 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref>\n\nThe 1958 excavations recovered 1,270 sherds, almost all of it Huber ware.  Surface was plain on 98% of sherds and cordmarked on 2%.  Half of the lips were unnotched.  The most common rim profile reported was everted with flat lip and either wide-notched or unnotched lip.  Rarely, sherds were red-slipped on the exterior and/or interior.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\nAn additional 3,347 sherds were recovered in the 1979 excavations, of very similar attributes.

Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips. Early Huber sites have also been observed to have significant amounts of Fisher Ware as well.  Late Huber pottery has predominately plain surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nIn the Oak Forest site assemblage, only 2.5%  of sherds are cordmarked, Wide-line decoration is reported to be rare.  Also, about half of the lips are unnotched. There is also no Fisher Ware at all in the Oak Forest assemblage; but Danner Ware is present, which has been found in early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] contexts at the Zimmerman site in northwestern [[Illinois]].  This combination of traits indicates a relatively later time placement for Oak Forest within the Huber sequence.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/><ref name=\"Michalik\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/>.

Both Fisher and Huber are [[Upper Mississippian]] cultures which existed in the southern [[Lake Michigan]] region in the states of northern [[Illinois]] and [[Indiana]] and southwest [[Michigan]].

James Griffin, upon examining the artifacts from the original 1929 excavations, felt that Huber was a Component of the [[Oneota]] Aspect based on the form and design of the pottery, close to the Orr and Lake Winnebago foci, and that Fisher was part of a separate Focus.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  Since that date, we\u2019ve obtained a great deal more information and now we know that Fisher is the older of the two and Huber is the one that survived to the [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.  Nevertheless, both Fisher and Huber coexist at the same sites seemingly at the same time.

The relationship between the two is time-related in that Huber is derived from Fisher; but there are also late Fisher sites like [[Fifield Site|Fifield]], where Fisher pottery is associated with late [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] artifacts, so it is possible that Fisher also survived until the [[Protohistory|Protohistoric]] or early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.<ref name=\"Brown3\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThere is direct evidence of cultivated plants at Oak Forest. The remains of [[maize]] were found along with [[Squash (plant)|squash]] and the [[common bean]].  [[Sunflower]] and [[wild rice]] were also recovered.  Also, the recovery of [[Polygonum|knotweed]], [[Hordeum pusillum|little barley]] and [[Chenopodium berlandieri|goosefoot]] indicates the Huber culture participated in the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]].  [[Deer]] bone was also present in abundance, along with [[Arrowhead|arrowheads]] for [[Bow and arrow|bows-and-arrows]], indicating the site residents still relied on [[hunting]]; and [[fish]] and [[turtle]] were also present in the animal bone remains, so they were also exploiting food resources of the nearby marshes and creeks.<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\nWith regards to seasonality of occupation, based on the presence of several house structures, and supported by an analysis of the animal bone and plant remains, the researchers determined the site functioned as a permanent to semi-permanent agricultural village.<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\nAlong with the [[Palos Site|Palos]] site, Oak Forest had some European-made trade articles included in the assemblage.  This indicates the Huber culture lasted until European contact and therefore was one of the Historic [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes encountered by the early explorers and [[Fur trade|fur traders]]. It has not been conclusively demonstrated which tribe exactly made the Huber pottery. However, the [[Potawatomi]], [[Illinois tribe|Illinois]] and [[Miami people|Miami]] have been recorded as present in the lower shores of [[Lake Michigan]] in the early historic period, and all have been suggested as the tribe corresponding to the Huber culture.<ref name=\"Brown3\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/><ref name=\"Brown4\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations Into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 5: Ethnohistoric Connections}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation | editor = James A.

The 1979 excavations took 42 samples for flotation analysis (24 from features and 18 from [[Midden|midden]] contexts) and as a result a wide variety of plant remains (wood charcoal, nutshell, maize, seeds and bulbs) were found which contribute immensely to our knowledge of [[Upper Mississippian]] subsistence.<ref name=\"Asch\">{{cite book |last1=Asch |first1=David L. |last2=Sidell |first2=Nancy Asch |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 13: Archaeobotany}}</ref>\n\nPlant analysis of flotation data is based primarily on carbonized remains; on plant material that was burned in a [[fire pit]] or [[hearth]] but not completely consumed.  The carbonized materials are rendered much more resistant to decay and thus are often available for the archaeologist to examine.  Not all of the carbonized plant remains are from food items; some of the small seeds recovered may have been intrusive due to the normal seed dispersal process (i.e. the wind just blew them into the fire).  Plant material that was not carbonized was of course subject to the normal process of decay and would not be available to the archaeologist except under extraordinary conditions.\n\n'''Summary of Findings:'''<ref name=\"Asch\"/>\n\n* [[Wood]] [[charcoal]] - the vast majority of all flotation samples (from 82-95%) were naturally from the wood that was used as firewood.  Each sample showed a great deal of diversity and although [[oak]] and [[hickory]] were dominant, [[maple]], [[ash]], [[American hornbeam]], [[American elm]], [[American hop hornbeam]], [[Populus|poplar]] and [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] were also present.  This mix reflects the trees present in the surrounding [[Deciduous forest|deciduous forests]] and [[Oak savanna|oak savannas]].\n* [[Nutshell]] - was ubiquitous and present in every sample.  [[Hickory nut]] and [[black walnut]] were the dominant species; [[hazelnut]] and [[acorn]] were also present.  Trace amounts of [[Butternut (tree)|butternut]] were present in a few features.\n* [[Maize]] - was the most abundant of the food plant remains.  Kernels, cupules and cob fragments of the 8- or 10-row variety were present in all samples.\n* Cultivated seeds - 80% of all seeds recovered were of [[Chenopodium berlandieri|goosefoot (Chenopodium berlandieri)]], [[Hordeum pusillum|little barley (Hordeum pusillum)]] and [[Polygonum erectum|knotweed (Polygonum erectum)]].  This indicates that the [[Upper Mississippian]] residents were part of the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]] (EAC) of cultivated seed plants that predated the introduction of [[maize]] in parts of [[North America]].  The EAC plants were first identified in [[Middle Woodland]] contexts and their use continued to the early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.\n* Other cultivated plants - [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[sunflower]] and the [[Common bean|common bean]] were also present.\n* [[Wild rice]] - was also present.  There is abundant evidence of Native American utilization of this resource in early Historic accounts.<ref name=\"Blair\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Blair |editor1-first=Emma Helen |title=The Indian Tribes of the Upper Mississippi Valley and Region of the Great Lakes |date=1911-1912 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |edition=1996 reprint}}</ref>\n* Fruit seeds - [[Plum|plum]], [[sumac]], [[grape]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] and [[ground cherry]] were also noted.\n* [[Bulb]] - a carbonized bulb of what appears to be [[Allium|wild onion]] was recovered.\n* Noneconomic seeds - seeds from several plants that are present in small quantities and do not have a food or other economic use are presumed to be intrusive; such as [[Desmodium|Desmodium (ground bulrush)]], [[Galium|Galium (tick trefoil)]], [[Xanthium|Xanthium (cocklebur)]] and [[Hypoxis hirsuta|Hypoxis hirsuta (yellow star-grass)]].  Even these intrusive seeds are useful to the archaeologist, because they can be used to help recreate the environment present at the time of site occupation.  Some of the intrusive seeds present at Oak Forest indicate a moist marshy environment was nearby, and others indicate a habitat of open fields and oak savannas.\n\n=== Animal Remains ===\n\nRemains from several species were recovered from the site.  The main species present were [[deer]] and [[fish]]; also present were [[turtle]], [[dog]], [[bald eagle]], [[sandhill crane]], [[otter]] and others.  These remains were not modified into tools like the bone tools described in the Artifacts section below, and may be considered food remains or, in the case of the dog, the remains of [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] activities.  Dog sacrifice and dog meat consumption was observed to have ceremonial and religious implications in early [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes.<ref name=\"Greenman\">{{cite journal |last1=Greenman |first1=E.F. |title=An Early Historic Cemetery in St. Ignace |journal=The Michigan Archaeologist |date=1958 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=29-30}}</ref>  In addition, bald eagles, sandhill cranes and otters were known to have spiritual significance in historic Native American religious groups/ceremonies such as the [[Midewiwin]].<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n=== Artifacts ===\n\n[[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] recovered from the site included:<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\n* [[Pottery]] - total of 1,270 sherds were recovered in the 1958 excavations, and another 3,347 were recovered in 1979.  The pottery artifacts will be discussed in more detail below.\n* Stone artifacts - including [[Projectile point|projectile points]], [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]] (including humpback scrapers), [[Burin (lithic flake)|gravers]], graver drills, knives, cores, utilized flakes and a chopper.  Of the projectile points, the most numerous category was the small triangular Madison point.\n* Ground stone artifacts - including [[Grinding Stone|grinding stones]], [[Hammerstone|hammerstones]]/[[Mano (stone)|manos]], [[Metate|metates]], abraders and a piece of [[hematite]] that may be a [[rubstone]].  \n* [[Bone]] and [[antler]] tools - including [[scapula]] [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]], an antler [[Wrench|wrench]] and a [[harpoon]].\n* [[Marine shell]] - a unique [[duck]] effigy [[pendant]] made out of [[marine shell]] was present at the site.\n* Early Historic artifacts - in 1958, a single [[iron]] fragment was found which was thought to be an early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] artifact of [[Europe|European]] manufacture.  In 1979 many more such remains were found due largely to the use of [[Flotation (archaeology)|flotation]]; including 2 tubular sheet [[brass]] hair pipes (similar to the [[copper]] specimens found at the [[Dumaw Creek Site|Dumaw Creek site]]<ref name=\"Quimby\">{{cite journal |last1=Quimby |first1=George I. |title=The Dumaw Creek Site |journal=Fieldiana |date=1966 |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=1-91}}</ref>), 3 fragments of crumpled sheet brass, 15 iron pieces (6 nails, 1 bolt, 1 washer, a strap with pendant tabs, 2 sheet fragments and 4 unidentified fragments), and a single white glass [[bead]] similar to those found at [[Iroquois|Iroquoian]] sites in [[Ontario]] and [[New York (state)|New York State]] (where they have been dated to the early 1600s).\n\nThe non-pottery artifacts found at an archaeological site can provide useful cultural context as well as a glimpse into the domestic tasks performed at a site; [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] or [[Religion|religious]] activities; recreational activities; and clothing or personal adornment.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/>\n\nSome of the most prominent and diagnostic non-pottery artifacts are presented here in more detail:<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n!

Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed over cordmarked.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.

Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips. Early Huber sites have also been observed to have significant amounts of Fisher Ware as well.  Late Huber pottery has predominately plain surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nIn the Oak Forest site assemblage, only 2.5%  of sherds are cordmarked, Wide-line decoration is reported to be rare.  Also, about half of the lips are unnotched. There is also no Fisher Ware at all in the Oak Forest assemblage; but Danner Ware is present, which has been found in early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] contexts at the Zimmerman site in northwestern [[Illinois]].  This combination of traits indicates a relatively later time placement for Oak Forest within the Huber sequence.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/><ref name=\"Michalik\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/>.

Both Fisher and Huber are [[Upper Mississippian]] cultures which existed in the southern [[Lake Michigan]] region in the states of northern [[Illinois]] and [[Indiana]] and southwest [[Michigan]].

James Griffin, upon examining the artifacts from the original 1929 excavations, felt that Huber was a Component of the [[Oneota]] Aspect based on the form and design of the pottery, close to the Orr and Lake Winnebago foci, and that Fisher was part of a separate Focus.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  Since that date, we\u2019ve obtained a great deal more information and now we know that Fisher is the older of the two and Huber is the one that survived to the [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.  Nevertheless, both Fisher and Huber coexist at the same sites seemingly at the same time.  [[Hoxie Farm Site|Hoxie Farm]], [[Griesmer Site|Griesmer]] and [[Moccasin Bluff Site|Moccasin Bluff]] are examples of this.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/><ref name=\"Brown3\"/>\n\nMost archaeologists now believe that both Fisher and Huber are taxonomically-related phases within the [[Oneota]] tradition.  The relationship between the two is time-related in that Huber is derived from Fisher; but there are also late Fisher sites like [[Fifield Site|Fifield]], where Fisher pottery is associated with late [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] artifacts, so it is possible that Fisher also survived until the [[Protohistory|Protohistoric]] or early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.<ref name=\"Brown3\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThere is direct evidence of cultivated plants at Oak Forest. The remains of [[maize]] were found along with [[Squash (plant)|squash]] and the [[common bean]].  [[Sunflower]] and [[wild rice]] were also recovered.  Also, the recovery of [[Polygonum|knotweed]], [[Hordeum pusillum|little barley]] and [[Chenopodium berlandieri|goosefoot]] indicates the Huber culture participated in the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]].  [[Deer]] bone was also present in abundance, along with [[Arrowhead|arrowheads]] for [[Bow and arrow|bows-and-arrows]], indicating the site residents still relied on [[hunting]]; and [[fish]] and [[turtle]] were also present in the animal bone remains, so they were also exploiting food resources of the nearby marshes and creeks.<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\nWith regards to seasonality of occupation, based on the presence of several house structures, and supported by an analysis of the animal bone and plant remains, the researchers determined the site functioned as a permanent to semi-permanent agricultural village.<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\nAlong with the [[Palos Site|Palos]] site, Oak Forest had some European-made trade articles included in the assemblage.  This indicates the Huber culture lasted until European contact and therefore was one of the Historic [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes encountered by the early explorers and [[Fur trade|fur traders]]. It has not been conclusively demonstrated which tribe exactly made the Huber pottery. However, the [[Potawatomi]], [[Illinois tribe|Illinois]] and [[Miami people|Miami]] have been recorded as present in the lower shores of [[Lake Michigan]] in the early historic period, and all have been suggested as the tribe corresponding to the Huber culture.<ref name=\"Brown3\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/><ref name=\"Brown4\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations Into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 5: Ethnohistoric Connections}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation | editor = James A.

In the contraction of ''Yehoshua`'' to ''Yeshua`'', the vowel is instead fronted (perhaps due to the influence of the ''y'' in the triliteral root ''y-\u0161-\u02bf'').

Since Greek had no equivalent to the Semitic letter {{hebrew|\u05e9}} ''shin'' {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, it was replaced with a {{lang|grc|\u03c3}} ''sigma'' {{IPA|[s]}}, and a masculine singular ending {{IPA|[-s]}} was added in the nominative case, in order to allow the name to be inflected for case (nominative, accusative, etc.) in the grammar of the Greek language. The diphthongal {{IPA|[a]}} vowel of Masoretic ''Yehoshua`'' or ''Yeshua`'' would not have been present in Hebrew/Aramaic pronunciation during this period, and some scholars believe some dialects dropped the [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] sound of the final letter {{hebrew|\u05e2}} ''`ayin'' {{IPA|[\u0295]}}, which in any case had no counterpart in ancient Greek.

The morphological jump this time was not as large as previous changes between language families. {{lang|grc|\u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2}} ''I\u0113sous'' was [[transliterated]] to Latin ''IESVS'', where it stood for many centuries. The Latin name has an irregular declension, with a genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative of {{lang|la|Jesu}}, accusative of {{lang|la|Jesum}}, and nominative of {{lang|la|Jesus}}. [[Lower case|Minuscule]] (lower case) letters were developed around 800 and some time later the [[U]] was invented to distinguish the [[vowel]] sound from the [[consonant]]al sound and the [[J]] to distinguish the consonant from [[I]]. Similarly, Greek minuscules were invented about the same time, prior to that the name was written in [[capital letters]] ({{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9\u039f\u03a5\u03f9}}) or abbreviated as ({{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9}}) with a line over the top, see also [[Christogram]].\n\n[[Modern English]] Jesus derives from Early Middle English ''Iesu'' (attested from the 12th century). The name participated in the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in late [[Middle English]] (15th century). The letter [[J]] was first distinguished from 'I' by the Frenchman [[Petrus Ramus|Pierre Ramus]] in the 16th century, but did not become common in Modern English until the 17th century, so that early 17th century works such as the first edition of the [[King James Version of the Bible]] (1611) continued to print the name with an I.<ref>[http://nazirene.peopleofhonoronly.com/images/kjv1611/Jesus_Iesus.jpg Image] of the first edition of the [[King James Version of the Bible]], [[Gospel of Luke]].

[[Tyndale]] in the 16th century has the occasional ''Iesu'' in oblique cases and in the vocative; The 1611 [[King James Version]] uses ''Iesus'' throughout, regardless of syntax.

In the contraction of ''Yehoshua`'' to ''Yeshua`'', the vowel is instead fronted (perhaps due to the influence of the ''y'' in the triliteral root ''y-\u0161-\u02bf'').

Since Greek had no equivalent to the Semitic letter {{hebrew|\u05e9}} ''shin'' {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, it was replaced with a {{lang|grc|\u03c3}} ''sigma'' {{IPA|[s]}}, and a masculine singular ending {{IPA|[-s]}} was added in the nominative case, in order to allow the name to be inflected for case (nominative, accusative, etc.) in the grammar of the Greek language. The diphthongal {{IPA|[a]}} vowel of Masoretic ''Yehoshua`'' or ''Yeshua`'' would not have been present in Hebrew/Aramaic pronunciation during this period, and some scholars believe some dialects dropped the [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] sound of the final letter {{hebrew|\u05e2}} ''`ayin'' {{IPA|[\u0295]}}, which in any case had no counterpart in ancient Greek. The Greek writings of [[Philo of Alexandria]]<ref name=\"Philo\">Philo Judaeus, <cite>De ebrietate</cite> in <cite>Philonis Alexandrini opera quae supersunt</cite>ed. P.

It also occurs in the Greek New Testament at Acts 7:45 and Hebrews 4:8, referring to Joshua son of Nun.\n\nFrom Greek, {{lang|grc|\u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2}} ''I\u0113sous'' moved into [[Latin]] at least by the time of the [[Vetus Latina]]. The morphological jump this time was not as large as previous changes between language families. {{lang|grc|\u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2}} ''I\u0113sous'' was [[transliterated]] to Latin ''IESVS'', where it stood for many centuries. The Latin name has an irregular declension, with a genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative of {{lang|la|Jesu}}, accusative of {{lang|la|Jesum}}, and nominative of {{lang|la|Jesus}}. [[Lower case|Minuscule]] (lower case) letters were developed around 800 and some time later the [[U]] was invented to distinguish the [[vowel]] sound from the [[consonant]]al sound and the [[J]] to distinguish the consonant from [[I]]. Similarly, Greek minuscules were invented about the same time, prior to that the name was written in [[capital letters]] ({{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9\u039f\u03a5\u03f9}}) or abbreviated as ({{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9}}) with a line over the top, see also [[Christogram]].\n\n[[Modern English]] Jesus derives from Early Middle English ''Iesu'' (attested from the 12th century). The name participated in the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in late [[Middle English]] (15th century). The letter [[J]] was first distinguished from 'I' by the Frenchman [[Petrus Ramus|Pierre Ramus]] in the 16th century, but did not become common in Modern English until the 17th century, so that early 17th century works such as the first edition of the [[King James Version of the Bible]] (1611) continued to print the name with an I.<ref>[http://nazirene.peopleofhonoronly.com/images/kjv1611/Jesus_Iesus.jpg Image] of the first edition of the [[King James Version of the Bible]], [[Gospel of Luke]].

[[Tyndale]] in the 16th century has the occasional ''Iesu'' in oblique cases and in the vocative; The 1611 [[King James Version]] uses ''Iesus'' throughout, regardless of syntax. ''Jesu'' came to be used in English, especially in [[hymn]]s.\n\n''Jesu'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|i\u02d0|z|u\u02d0}} {{respell|JEE|zoo}}; from [[Latin]] ''Iesu'') is sometimes used as the [[vocative case|vocative]] of [[Jesus]] in English.  The oblique form, ''Iesu.'', came to be used in [[Middle English]].\n\n===Other languages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\n[[File:Early Syriac alphabet form of the name of Jesus.svg |thumb|''Isho'' or ''Eesho'', the [[Aramaic]]/[[Syriac language|Syriac]] name of [[Jesus]]]]\nIn [[North Germanic languages|East Scandinavian]], [[German language|German]] and several other languages, the name ''Jesus'' is used.
