In a joint effort with the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] and the [[Voters Telecommunications Watch]], iWorld and Mecklermedia publicly endorsed a national day of protest {{ref|iworldprotest}}, turning the background of [[web page]]s around the world to black. The protest received national news coverage and was a catalyst in the planning for a lawsuit ([[Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union]]) which went to the [[United States Supreme Court]] and reaffirmed [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protection for Internet publishers.\n\nAfter leaving iWorld, Louis contributed to many publications as a [[freelance]] writer, including a popular line of introductions to the internet, and helped co-found several [[startup company|start-ups]], including Earthweb and Net Quotient, a consulting group. At Earthweb, Louis reprised his role of editor, hoping to reproduce the early success of iWorld{{ref|tristanearthweb}} and helping launch the company on the stock market.\n\nFrom 1999 to early 2000, Louis joined the short-lived [[Dot-com company|dot-com]] [[Boo.com]]; when the company failed, he wrote a detailed analysis of the challenges the company had faced{{ref|boofails}}, offering some context in terms of running large scale [[website]]s, which was widely circulated.\n\nIn January 2006, Louis participated in [[Microsoft]] Search Champs v4 in Seattle.\n\nIn 2011, Louis returned to startups, launching Keepskor, a branded app company which was acquired in 2014.\n\nSince 2017, Mr. Louis serves as president and CEO of [[Casebook PBC]], an organization focused on building a SaaS platform for social services.\n\n== Wall Street career ==\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Louis worked in several roles on Wall Street, most notably as Global Chief Innovation Officer for [[HSBC]], where he was instrumental to developing several large scale internet offerings and provided the company with thought leadership in the technology innovation arena and Global Head of Mobile and Internet at [[Deutsche Bank]]. This led him to work on effort as varied as internet-only banking, transaction banking system, credit card clearing systems, and micro-transaction offerings. Mr. Louis has been credited with improving relationships between the video-game and banking industry by helping video-game companies understand the need for the kind of strong authentication, fraud-monitoring, and payment solutions that only large multinational banks can offer. In September 2008, in a speech at the [[Web 2.0 Summit|Web 2.0 conference]]{{ref|web20}} (reprised in a different way at the [[World Economic Forum]] Annual Meeting), Louis predicted the rise of crypto-currencies (which he called \"virtual currencies\") long before the popularity of Bitcoin.\n\n==Contributions to standards==\nThroughout the 1990s, Louis was involved in a number of initiatives led by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]], including the development of an early draft standard for merging television with the web{{ref|tvml}}. The initiative was launched too early in the development of the web and the effort quickly died off with few people adopting the proposed standard.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Louis was involved in the development community surrounding [[RSS (file format)|RSS]], proposing a number of amendments to the specifications{{ref|rss}} of the time. The proposal included creating a date element for every item in an RSS feed and provided the theoretical framework to distribute data files over an RSS channel, anticipating what is now known as [[podcasting]].\n\n==Writing==\nIn 1994-1995, Louis served as editor on a number of guides to the Internet. He was a principal research editor on five books authored by Michael Wolff: Net.Games{{ref|netgames}}, Net.Money{{ref|netmoney}}, Net.Sports{{ref|netsports}}, Net.Trek{{ref|nettrek}}, and Net.Tech{{ref|nettech}}. Louis also wrote articles for a wide number of technology publications{{ref|bibliography}} including ''The [[Silicon Alley]] Reporter,'' ''Business 2.0, IEEE Spectrum, The New York Times, ''and'' others.''\n\nBeginning in 2000, Louis started publishing a weblog, which is noted for its dissection and research into technology trends.\n\nIn 2010, Louis became a frequent contributor to [[Business Insider]]{{ref|bi}} and [[Forbes]]{{ref|forbes}}.\n\nIn 2011, Louis started a weekly column called \"On technology\".

Since the 1940s, New York had been a Democratic-leaning [[swing state]], usually voting Democratic in close elections, but often by small margins. Republicans would dominate much of upstate New York and populated suburban counties like [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. However they would be narrowly outvoted statewide by the fiercely Democratic and massively populated [[New York City]] area, along with some upstate cities like [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and the college town of [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]]. This pattern would endure in 1988 for the final time, allowing Bush to keep the race fairly close, only losing the state to Dukakis by 4%. As a result, 1988 was the last time in the state's history that New York was considered a swing state.\n\nDukakis\u2019 statewide victory is largely attributable to winning the five boroughs of New York City overall with 66.2% of the vote. However even though losing the city in a landslide, Bush\u2019s 32.8% of the vote was a relatively respectable showing for a Republican in NYC, particularly in retrospect. In the 6 elections that have followed 1988, Republican presidential candidates have received only 17 to 24% of the vote in New York City.\n\nThis was the last election in which a Republican presidential nominee won heavily populated Nassau and Westchester Counties, as well as [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga]], and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster Counties]],<ref name=\"how\">Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century \u2018How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century\u2019]; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref> and also the last election in which New York was decided by a single-digit margin. Beginning in [[1992 United States presidential election in New York|1992]], the Democrats would make substantial inroads in the suburbs around New York City as well as parts of upstate, making New York a solid [[Red states and blue states|blue state]] that has gone Democratic by double-digit margins in every election since.\n\n==Results==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1988 United States presidential election in New York\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n| ''Michael Dukakis''\n| align=\"right\" | 3,255,487\n| align=\"right\" | 50.19%\n| align=\"right\" |\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#CC0000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal]]\n| ''Michael Dukakis''\n| align=\"right\" | 92,395\n| align=\"right\" | 1.42%\t\n| align=\"right\" |\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#B2BEB5; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | '''Total'''\n| '''[[Michael Dukakis]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''3,347,882'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''51.62%'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''36'''\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n| ''George H.

Since the 1940s, New York had been a Democratic-leaning [[swing state]], usually voting Democratic in close elections, but often by small margins. Republicans would dominate much of upstate New York and populated suburban counties like [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. However they would be narrowly outvoted statewide by the fiercely Democratic and massively populated [[New York City]] area, along with some upstate cities like [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and the college town of [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]]. This pattern would endure in 1988 for the final time, allowing Bush to keep the race fairly close, only losing the state to Dukakis by 4%. As a result, 1988 was the last time in the state's history that New York was considered a swing state.\n\nDukakis\u2019 statewide victory is largely attributable to winning the five boroughs of New York City overall with 66.2% of the vote. However even though losing the city in a landslide, Bush\u2019s 32.8% of the vote was a relatively respectable showing for a Republican in NYC, particularly in retrospect. In the 6 elections that have followed 1988, Republican presidential candidates have received only 17 to 24% of the vote in New York City.\n\nThis was the last election in which a Republican presidential nominee won heavily populated Nassau and Westchester Counties, as well as [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga]], and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster Counties]],<ref name=\"how\">Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century \u2018How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century\u2019]; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref> and also the last election in which New York was decided by a single-digit margin. Beginning in [[1992 United States presidential election in New York|1992]], the Democrats would make substantial inroads in the suburbs around New York City as well as parts of upstate, making New York a solid [[Red states and blue states|blue state]] that has gone Democratic by double-digit margins in every election since.\n\n==Results==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1988 United States presidential election in New York\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n| ''Michael Dukakis''\n| align=\"right\" | 3,255,487\n| align=\"right\" | 50.19%\n| align=\"right\" |\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#CC0000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal]]\n| ''Michael Dukakis''\n| align=\"right\" | 92,395\n| align=\"right\" | 1.42%\t\n| align=\"right\" |\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#B2BEB5; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | '''Total'''\n| '''[[Michael Dukakis]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''3,347,882'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''51.62%'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''36'''\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n| ''George H.W.

It is based on the best-selling [[The Girl Who Played with Fire|novel of the same name]] by the late Swedish author and journalist [[Stieg Larsson]], the second in his [[Millennium series|''Millennium'' series]].\n\nThe film follows [[Lisbeth Salander]] as she returns to Sweden after spending a year abroad. She falls under suspicion of having murdered a journalist and his girlfriend as well as her own social services guardian, Nils Bjurman. [[Mikael Blomkvist]] has to do what he can to find her before the authorities do.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lisbeth Salander]] purchases an apartment in [[Stockholm]]. On returning to [[Sweden]] after nearly a year living abroad, Salander reconnects with her best friend and former partner Miriam Wu and offers her free use of her old apartment in return for forwarding her mail. Later, Salander confronts Nils Bjurman after hacking into his mail and discovering that he has an appointment booked with a tattoo removal specialist. Threatening him with his own gun, she warns him not to remove the tattoo that she etched on his abdomen.\n\n''Millennium'' magazine welcomes Dag Svensson, a new journalist who is writing an expos\u00e9 on prostitution and [[human trafficking]] in Sweden. Dag's girlfriend, Mia Bergman, is writing her [[thesis|doctoral thesis]] on [[sex trafficking]]. Dag is nearly finished with the story and is confronting those who will be exposed by the article. Dag and his girlfriend are about to leave on a holiday and ask Mikael Blomkvist to come to his apartment and collect some photographs. At the same time Dag also asks Blomkvist to inquire about someone called \"Zala,\" who may have a connection to his present research. Blomkvist arrives at their apartment and finds the two lying dead. The murder weapon is tracked to Bjurman who is also deceased. Salander is the prime suspect, as her fingerprints happen to be on the gun. Salander tells Blomkvist that she did not kill anyone and that he needs to find the mysterious \"Zala.\"\n\nBlomkvist is contacted by Salander's boxing trainer and friend, [[Paolo Roberto]].  While he is unaware of Salander's whereabouts, Paolo does know Miriam, who also trained with them, and promises to pay her a visit. Near her apartment, Paolo witnesses Miriam being kidnapped by strongman Ronald Niedermann. Paolo follows his car to a deserted barn, where he hears him beat Miriam for information about Salander. Paolo comes in to rescue her but Niedermann beats him too. He then sets the barn aflame, but the two manage to escape.\n\nNews breaks of the attack, and Paolo gives his account to the police. After Blomkvist leaves information that he has discovered about the case on his computer for Salander to hack into and read, she leaves a message to him saying, \"Thank you for being my friend.\" He realizes that she intends to set out alone to find the man who framed her and that she may not survive. A disguised Salander visits Miriam in hospital to apologize for getting her involved. Without giving anything away, Salander confirms the police sketch of Niedermann with Miriam and then disappears. Knowing now that he is Salander's friend, Miriam calls Blomkvist to the hospital to give him keys that Lisbeth dropped during her visit. Noticing that one of them is for a post office box, Blomkvist is able to access and read Salander's mail and locate her apartment. Meanwhile, Salander continues her efforts to find Niedermann by patiently staking out his post office box. She eventually sees someone retrieve his mail and follows him to a small house near Gosseberga. Reading the material in Lisbeth's apartment, Blomkvist finds the video of Bjurman raping Salander.\n\nIn the offices of ''Millennium'' magazine, Paolo explains that he tracked down Niedermann and learned that he has [[Congenital insensitivity to pain|congenital analgesia]] which makes him unable to feel pain. They trace Niedermann to a company owned by \"Karl Axel Bodin.\" Blomkvist has Erika Berger forward documents to Bublanski and sets out to find Salander.\n\nSalander crosses the grounds and enters the Gosseberga house, but Niedermann has been alerted by motion detectors and knocks her out. She awakens to see her father, Alexander \"Zala\" Zalachenko, an old man who walks with a stick and is heavily scarred by the burns that she inflicted as a child. He dismisses her mother as a whore and belittles her rape at the hands of Bjurman. He reveals that Niedermann is her half-brother and that Niedermann killed Bjurman to prevent him from revealing any of Zalachenko's secrets.\n\nThey lead Lisbeth to a shallow grave in the woods. She tells him that the police will find him soon and all that he has said has been published online through her hidden cellphone. Seeing through her bluff, he shoots Lisbeth several times as she attempts to escape and buries her alive. Salander digs her way out using her cigarette case. Hidden in the woodshed, she surprises Zalachenko sticking an axe into his leg. She then keeps Niedermann at bay with Zalachenko's gun as Blomkvist comes coasting up the driveway. Ambulances and police arrive to take away Salander and Zalachenko who are both very badly injured.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Nyqvist]] as Mikael Blomkvist\n* [[Noomi Rapace]] as Lisbeth Salander\n* [[Lena Endre]] as Erika Berger\n* [[Peter Andersson (actor)|Peter Andersson]] as Nils Erik Bjurman\n* [[Per Oscarsson]] as Holger Palmgren\n* [[Georgi Staykov]] as Alexander Zalachenko\n* [[Sofia Ledarp]] as Malin Eriksson\n* [[Yasmine Garbi]] as Miriam Wu\n* [[Annika Hallin]] as Annika Giannini\n* [[Tanja Lorentzon]] as Sonja Modig\n* [[Paolo Roberto]] as himself\n* [[Johan Kyl\u00e9n]] as Jan Bublanski <!-- police Inspector, lead investigator -->\n* [[Magnus Krepper]] as Hans Faste <!-- police officer -->\n* [[Ralph Carlsson]] as Gunnar Bj\u00f6rck\n* [[Micke Spreitz]] as Ronald Niedermann\n* [[Anders Ahlbom]] as Dr. Peter Teleborian\n* [[Tehilla Blad]] as young Lisbeth Salander\n\n==Production==\n[[Daniel Alfredson]] takes over from [[Niels Arden Oplev]], who directed ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009 film)|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', the first part of the trilogy.\n<!-- different director and adapter <ref name=\"chicagotribune\" /> -->\n<!-- \"originally made for television\" \nmuch more sober, scaled-down and businesslike affair than its made-for-the-big-screen predecessor. \nhttps://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/article/833771--the-girl-who-played-with-fire-burning-curiosity-about-lisbeth-salander \n-->\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n{{Anchor|Critics}}\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics, although some noted it a step down from its predecessor.

Such being the extent of desperation, this naturally resulted in hatred and suspicion and their status is classified as active.\n\n=== NLFT ===\n\nThe [[National Liberation Front of Tripura]] was formed in March 1989.\n\n=== ATTF ===\n\nThe [[All Tripura Tiger Force]] was formed by local aboriginal tribes in 1990, who were gradually outnumbered both directly and indirectly, even at the cost of being threatened for their survival economically and culturally, not to speak of their being reduced to minority population-wise; their sole aim is the expulsion of all [[Bengali language|Bengali speaking]] immigrants from the rest of India and nearby Bangladesh.\n\n== Meghalaya ==\n{{Main|Insurgency in Meghalaya}}\nThe state of [[Meghalaya]] was separated from the state of Assam in 1971, in order to satisfy the [[Khasi people|Khasi]], [[Synteng]] and [[Garo people|Garo]] for a separate state. The decision was initially praised as an example of successful national integration into the wider Indian state.<ref name=SwO>{{cite web|url=http://www.bethanylacina.com/Lacina_IndiaSeparatism_2013.pdf |title=Nationalism and the origins of separatist civil war in India |work=University of Rochester |accessdate=18 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133721/http://www.bethanylacina.com/Lacina_IndiaSeparatism_2013.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThis, however, failed to prevent the rise of [[national consciousness]] among the local tribal populations, later leading to a direct confrontation between [[Indian nationalism]] and the newly created Garo and Khasi nationalisms. A parallel rise of nationalism in the other members of the [[Seven Sister States]] further complicated the situation, resulting in occasional clashes between rebel groups.<ref name=SwO/>\n\nThe state wealth distribution system further fueled the rising separatist movements, as funding is practised through per-capita transfers, which largely benefits the leading ethnic group.<ref name=SwO/>\n\nThe first militant outfit to emerge in the region was the [[Hynniewtrep Achik Liberation Council]] (HALC).

In 1986, the [[Mizo accord]] ended the main secessionist movement led by the [[Mizo National Front]], bringing peace to the region.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Insurgency status is classified as partially active, due to secessionist/autonomy demands by the Chakmas and Brus.\n\n=== HPC-D ===\n\nThe [[Hmar Peopl]]e's Convention-Democracy is an armed insurgency group formed in 1995 to create an independent [[Hmar]] State in North East India. It is the offspring of the Hmar People's Convention (HPC), which entered into an agreement with the Government of Mizoram in 1994 resulting in the formation of the Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) in North Mizoram.

The camps were set up by four Assamese separatist movements: the ULFA, NDFB, [[Bodo Liberation Tigers Force]] (BLTF)  and [[Kamtapur Liberation Organization]] (KLO).

The government of Bhutan initially pursued a peaceful solution, opening dialogue with the militant groups on 1998. Five rounds of talks were held with ULFA, three rounds with DNFB, with KLO ignoring all invitations sent by the government. In June 2001 ULFA agreed to close down four of its camps; however, the Bhutanese government soon realized that the camps had simply been relocated.<ref name=XdF>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcs.org/pdf_file/issue/IB18-OperationAllClear.pdf|title=Implications for insurgency and security cooperation|author=Dipankar Banerjee|work=IPCS|date=January 2004|accessdate=5 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924040812/http://www.ipcs.org/pdf_file/issue/IB18-OperationAllClear.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBy 2003 the talks had failed to produce any significant result.

Such being the extent of desperation, this naturally resulted in hatred and suspicion and their status is classified as active.\n\n=== NLFT ===\n\nThe [[National Liberation Front of Tripura]] was formed in March 1989.\n\n=== ATTF ===\n\nThe [[All Tripura Tiger Force]] was formed by local aboriginal tribes in 1990, who were gradually outnumbered both directly and indirectly, even at the cost of being threatened for their survival economically and culturally, not to speak of their being reduced to minority population-wise; their sole aim is the expulsion of all [[Bengali language|Bengali speaking]] immigrants from the rest of India and nearby Bangladesh.\n\n== Meghalaya ==\n{{Main|Insurgency in Meghalaya}}\nThe state of [[Meghalaya]] was separated from the state of Assam in 1971, in order to satisfy the [[Khasi people|Khasi]], [[Synteng]] and [[Garo people|Garo]] for a separate state. The decision was initially praised as an example of successful national integration into the wider Indian state.<ref name=SwO>{{cite web|url=http://www.bethanylacina.com/Lacina_IndiaSeparatism_2013.pdf |title=Nationalism and the origins of separatist civil war in India |work=University of Rochester |accessdate=18 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133721/http://www.bethanylacina.com/Lacina_IndiaSeparatism_2013.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThis, however, failed to prevent the rise of [[national consciousness]] among the local tribal populations, later leading to a direct confrontation between [[Indian nationalism]] and the newly created Garo and Khasi nationalisms. A parallel rise of nationalism in the other members of the [[Seven Sister States]] further complicated the situation, resulting in occasional clashes between rebel groups.<ref name=SwO/>\n\nThe state wealth distribution system further fueled the rising separatist movements, as funding is practised through per-capita transfers, which largely benefits the leading ethnic group.<ref name=SwO/>\n\nThe first militant outfit to emerge in the region was the [[Hynniewtrep Achik Liberation Council]] (HALC).

The camps were set up by four Assamese separatist movements: the ULFA, NDFB, [[Bodo Liberation Tigers Force]] (BLTF)  and [[Kamtapur Liberation Organization]] (KLO).

The government of Bhutan initially pursued a peaceful solution, opening dialogue with the militant groups on 1998. Five rounds of talks were held with ULFA, three rounds with DNFB, with KLO ignoring all invitations sent by the government. In June 2001 ULFA agreed to close down four of its camps; however, the Bhutanese government soon realized that the camps had simply been relocated.<ref name=XdF>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcs.org/pdf_file/issue/IB18-OperationAllClear.pdf|title=Implications for insurgency and security cooperation|author=Dipankar Banerjee|work=IPCS|date=January 2004|accessdate=5 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924040812/http://www.ipcs.org/pdf_file/issue/IB18-OperationAllClear.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBy 2003 the talks had failed to produce any significant result.
