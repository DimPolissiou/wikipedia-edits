The disk is about 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;in) in diameter and covered on both sides with a spiral of stamped symbols. Its purpose and meaning, and even its original geographical place of manufacture, remain disputed, making it one of the most famous mysteries of [[archaeology]]. This unique object is now on display at the [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum|archaeological museum]] of [[Heraklion]].\n\nThe disc was discovered in 1908 by the Italian archaeologist [[Luigi Pernier]] in the Minoan palace-site of Phaistos, and features 241 tokens, comprising 45 distinct signs, which were apparently made by pressing hieroglyphic \"seals\" into a disc of soft clay, in a clockwise sequence spiraling toward the center of the disk.\n\nThe Phaistos Disc captured the imagination of amateur and professional archaeologists, and many [[Phaistos Disc decipherment claims|attempts have been made to decipher the code]] behind the disc's signs. While it is not clear that it is a script, most attempted [[decipherment]]s assume that it is; most additionally assume a [[syllabary]], others an [[alphabet]] or [[logography]]. Attempts at decipherment are generally thought to be unlikely to succeed unless more examples of the signs are found, as it is generally agreed that there is not enough context available for a meaningful analysis.\n\nAlthough the Phaistos Disc is generally accepted as authentic by archaeologists, a few scholars believe that the disc is a [[forgery]] or a [[hoax]].\n\n==Discovery==\n[[Image:Table Ph1.png|thumb|250px|Tablet PH-1]]The Phaistos Disc was discovered in the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] palace-site of [[Phaistos]], near [[Hagia Triada]], on the south coast of [[Crete]];<ref>[http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10857/phaistos.html#fieldnotes C.Michael Hogan, ''Phaistos fieldnotes'', The Modern Antiquarian, 2007]</ref> specifically the disc was found in the basement of room 8 in building 101 of a group of buildings to the northeast of the main palace. This grouping of four rooms also served as a formal entry into the palace complex.  [[Italy|Italian]] archaeologist [[Luigi Pernier]] recovered the intact \"dish\", about {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and uniformly slightly more than {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=off}} in thickness, on 3 July 1908 during his [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] of the first Minoan palace.\n\nIt was found in the main cell of an underground \"temple depository\". These basement cells, only accessible from above, were neatly covered with a layer of fine [[plaster]]. Their content was poor in precious artifacts, but rich in black earth and ashes, mixed with burnt [[bovine]] bones. In the northern part of the main cell, in the same black layer, a few centimetres south-east of the disc and about {{cvt|50|cm|abbr=off}} above the floor, [[Linear A]] tablet ''PH 1'' was also found. The site apparently collapsed as a result of an [[earthquake]], possibly linked with the  [[Minoan eruption|eruption]] of the [[Santorini]] volcano that affected large parts of the [[Mediterranean region]] during the mid second millennium B.C.\n\n=== Authenticity ===\nThe Phaistos Disc is generally accepted as authentic by archaeologists.<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell-Dunn|first=Graham|title=Who Were the Minoans?|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2006|pages=207|isbn=978-1-4259-2007-4}}</ref> The assumption of authenticity is based on the excavation records by Luigi Pernier.

([[Minoan chronology|MMIII]]) on the basis of Luigi Pernier's report, which says that the Disc was in a  Middle Minoan undisturbed context. Jeppesen (1963) dates it to after 1400 ([[Minoan chronology|LMII-III]]). Doubting the viability of Pernier's report, [[Louis Godart]] (1990) resigns himself to admitting that archaeologically, the disc may be dated to anywhere in Middle or Late Minoan times (MMI-LMIII, a period spanning most of the [[second millennium B.C.]]). J. Best suggests a date in the first half of the fourteenth century B.C. (LMIIIA) based on his dating of tablet PH 1.<ref name=\"AchterbergSociety2004\">{{cite book|author1=Winfried Achterberg|author2=Dutch Archaeological and Historical Society|title=The Phaistos disc: a Luwian letter to Nestor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9hmAAAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Dutch Archaeological and Historical Society|isbn=978-90-72067-11-1}}</ref>\n\n== Typography ==\nThe inscription was apparently made by pressing hieroglyphic \"seals\" into the soft clay, in a clockwise sequence spiraling toward the center of the disk. It was then fired at high temperature. The unique character of the Phaistos Disc stems from the fact that the entire text was inscribed in this way, reproducing a body of text with reusable characters.\n\nThe German typesetter and linguist [[Herbert Brekle]], in his article \"The typographic principle\" in the ''[[Gutenberg-Jahrbuch]]'', argues that the Phaistos Disc is an early document of [[movable type]] printing, since it meets the essential criterion of [[typographic]] printing, that of type identity:\n\n{{quote|An early clear incidence for the realization of the typographic principle is the notorious Phaistos Disc (ca. 1800\u20131600 B.C.). If the disc is, as assumed, a textual representation, we are really dealing with a \"printed\" text, which fulfills all definitional criteria of the typographic principle. The spiral sequencing of the graphematical units, the fact that they are impressed in a clay disc (blind printing!) and not imprinted are merely possible technological variants of textual representation.

The disc shows traces of [[#Corrections|corrections]] made by the scribe in several places.

Of the eight twice-occurring symbols, four (03, 21, 28, 41) occur on side A only, three (09, 16, 20) on side B only, and only one (14) on both sides.\n\n===Oblique stroke signs===\nThere are a number of signs marked with an oblique stroke; the strokes are not imprinted but carved by hand, and are attached to the first or last sign of a \"word\", depending on the direction of reading chosen. Their meaning is a matter of discussion. One hypothesis, supported by Evans, Duhoux, Ohlenroth and others, is that they were used to subdivide the text into paragraphs, but alternative meanings have been offered by other scholars.\n\n===Directionality===\nEvans, at one point, published an assertion that the disc had been written, and should be read, from the center out; because it would have been easiest to place the inscription first and then size the disc to fit the text. There is general agreement that he was wrong, and Evans himself later changed his mind: the inscription was made, and should be read, from the outside in toward the centre. The centres of the spirals are not in the centre of the disc, and some of the symbols near the centre are crowded, as though the maker was cramped for space. One pair of symbols are set top-to-bottom, so it is hard to tell what order they should be in. Except in the cramped section, when there are overstrikes, the inner symbol overlies the outer symbol. Jean Faucounau has proposed a reconstruction of the scribe's movements, which would also require an inward direction; Yves Duhoux says that any outward reading may be discarded. Despite this consensus, there are still a few such attempted decipherments (See [[Phaistos Disc decipherment claims]]).\n\nIn addition to the question of the directionality of the text on the disc itself, different viewpoints are held as to how the Phaistos Disc characters should be displayed when transcribed into text. The disc itself probably has right-to-left directionality, if reading proceeds from the outside to the centre; this means that the reading direction is into the faces of the people and animals, as it is in Egyptian and Anatolian. Phaistos Disc characters are shown with left-to-right directionality in this article, with the glyphs mirrored compared to their orientation on the disc; which is also the typical practice for edited Egyptian and Anatolian hieroglyphic text.\n\n===Inscription text===\nThe following is a rendering of the Phaistos Disc inscription in [[Unicode]] characters (the text will only be displayed correctly if a font that supports Unicode Phaistos Disc characters, such as [[Noto Sans|Noto Sans Symbols]] or [[Everson Mono]] is installed):\n\nSide A\n\n<span style=\"font-size:140%;\">\u00a6 \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\udddc\ud800\uddd0\ud800\udde1\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\udde7\ud800\uddf7\ud800\udddb | \ud800\uddec\ud800\uddfc\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddec\ud800\uddec\ud800\uddf1 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddd3\ud800\uddf7\ud800\uddf0 | \ud800\uddea\ud800\uddfc\ud800\uddd6\ud800\udddb | \ud800\uddea\ud800\uddfb\ud800\uddd7 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddd5\ud800\udde1[.] | \ud800\uddee\ud800\udde9\ud800\uddf2 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddf8\ud800\udde2\ud800\uddf2 | \ud800\uddd0\ud800\uddf8\ud800\uddf7\ud800\uddd6 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddef\ud800\udde6\ud800\uddf5\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddf6\ud800\uddda | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\uddea\ud800\udde8\ud800\uddd9\ud800\udde6\ud800\udde1 | \ud800\uddeb\ud800\uddd0\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddee\ud800\udde9\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddea\ud800\uddea\ud800\uddf2\ud800\uddf4\ud800\udde4 | \ud800\uddf0\ud800\udde6 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddee\ud800\udde9\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\uddea\ud800\udde8\ud800\uddd9\ud800\udde6\ud800\udde1 | \ud800\uddeb\ud800\uddd0\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddee\ud800\udde9\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddea\ud800\udddd\ud800\uddef\ud800\udde1\ud800\uddea | \ud800\uddd5\ud800\udde1\ud800\udde0\ud800\udde2 | \ud800\uddee\ud800\udde9\ud800\udddb | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\udddc\ud800\uddd0 | \ud800\udde6\ud800\udde2\ud800\uddf2\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd9\ud800\uddd2\ud800\uddf5 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddea\ud800\uddea\ud800\uddf2\ud800\uddf4\ud800\udde4 | \ud800\udddc\ud800\uddd0 | \ud800\uddd9\ud800\uddd2\ud800\uddf5 |</span>\n\nSide B\n\n<span style=\"font-size:140%;\">\u00a6 \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\udde5\ud800\uddf7\ud800\uddd6 | \ud800\uddea\ud800\uddfc\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddf2 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\uddf4\ud800\udde6\ud800\uddd4\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\udde5\ud800\udde8\ud800\uddea | \ud800\uddf0\ud800\udde7\ud800\udde3\ud800\udddb | \ud800\udddf\ud800\udde6\ud800\udde1\ud800\uddfa\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\udddc\ud800\uddd0\ud800\uddf6\ud800\uddf0 | \ud800\uddde\ud800\uddd6\ud800\udddc\ud800\uddd0\ud800\udde1 | \ud800\udde5\ud800\uddf4\ud800\uddf9\ud800\udde8 | \ud800\uddd6\ud800\udde7\ud800\uddf7\ud800\uddf2 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udde9\ud800\uddf3\ud800\uddf7 | \ud800\uddea\ud800\udde8\ud800\uddf5\ud800\uddd0 | \ud800\uddec\ud800\udde7\ud800\udde7\ud800\udde3\ud800\uddf2 | \ud800\udddf\ud800\udddd\ud800\udde1 | \ud800\uddec\ud800\uddf0\ud800\uddd0 | \ud800\uddd5\ud800\uddf2\ud800\uddef\ud800\uddf6\ud800\uddf0 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\uddd8\ud800\uddea\ud800\uddd0 | \ud800\uddec\ud800\uddf3\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddd7\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddec\ud800\uddd7\ud800\udddc | \ud800\uddec\ud800\uddfc\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\udde5\ud800\uddec\ud800\uddf3\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddd7\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddea\ud800\uddf1\ud800\udde6\ud800\udde8 | \ud800\uddd6\ud800\udde1\ud800\uddf2 | \ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddfc\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd6\ud800\udde6\ud800\udde1\ud800\udde7 | \ud800\udde5\ud800\uddec\ud800\uddf3\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddd7\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd8\ud800\udded\ud800\uddf6\ud800\udde1\ud800\uddd6 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\uddd5\ud800\uddf2\ud800\udde6\ud800\uddd6 | \ud800\uddec\ud800\uddf1\ud800\udde6\ud800\udde8 | \ud800\uddfc\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddfd |</span>\n\n[[File:PhaistosDiskTranscribed.png|center|frame|Width200|Image of the transcription for those who do not have the appropriate fonts installed.]]\n\n[[File:Discos Phaitos Umzeichnung.png|thumb|Fields numbering by Louis Godart]]\nThere are 61 \"words\", 31 on side A and 30 on side B (numbered A1 to A31 and B1 to B30, outside to inside), here read outside-to-inside (putting the \"plumed head\" signs word-initially and the strokes word-finally). The shortest words are two symbols in length, the longest seven symbols. The strokes are here transcribed as diagonal strokes (/). The transcription begins at the vertical line of five dots, circling the rim of the disc once, clockwise (13 words on A, 12 words on B) before spiralling toward the center (18 more words on each side). There is one word-final effaced sign at A8, which Godart (1995:101) notes as resembling sign 3 or 20; or less probably 8 or 44. Evans considered side A as the front side, but technical arguments have since been forwarded favouring side B as the front side.\n\nThe signs in the transcription below appear in left-to-right orientation, and the reader may read into the faces of the human and animal figures (as one reads Egyptian and Anatolian hieroglyphs):\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\"

word-initially, in 13 instances followed by the \"shield\" (12, which in some instances also occurs word-finally). Six words occur twice each:\nThe three-word sequence 02-27-25-10-23-18 28-01/ 02-12-31-26/ occurs twice (A14-16, A20-22). 02-12-31-26/ recurs for a third time (A19). Four more words occur twice each, 02-12-27-27-35-37-21 (A17, A29), 10-03-38 (A28, A31), 22-29-36-07-08/ (B21, B26) and 29-45-07/ (A3, B20).\n\n===Corrections===\nAs noted [[#Signs|above]], corrections have been made. Signs have been erased and over-printed by other signs.\n\nGodart (1995:99-107) describes these corrections, by word.\nThey occur in the following words: A1 (signs 02-12-13-01), A4 (29-29-34) together with A5 (02-12-04), A8 (12), A10 (02-41-19?-35), A12 (12), A16 (12-31-26?), A17 (second 27?), A29 (second 27?), B1 (12-22), B3 (37?), B4 (22-25 imprinted over the same), B10 (07?-24?-40?), B13 (beside 29?). Question marks indicate uncertainty about that particular sign being the result of a correction.\n\nAlso, the borders of word B28 has been widened to make room for sign 02. See Duhoux (1977:34-35) and Godart (1995:107).\n\n=== Rotations ===\n\nThe two signs 27 (Hide) in word A29 are rotated 180 degrees compared with all other occurrences of this sign: \"head down\" versus \"head up\". This rotation might be motivated by lack of space in A29; see Duhoux (1977), p.24 (section 6A-8). \n\nThe rotations of the signs 29 (Cat) and 31 (Eagle) have no lack of space. Defining the sign 29 in words B19, B20 and B21 as \"head to the right\", we have: head down in B29; head to the left in A3 and B15; head up in B18 and B26; head in between up and left in B13; head in between right and down in A4 (twice). The direction of the head of sign 31 is as follows: to the right in A16, up in A9 and A25, and to the left in A22.\n\nThe sign 02 (Plumed head) in word A29 is 90 degrees rotated to the right compared with all other occurrences of this sign. This might well be due to lack of space; the word is crowded and messy, with the sign 12 (Shield) pushed aside. \n\nThe two occurrences of sign 28 (Bull's leg) are not rotated compared with each other. Rather, the way this sign is shown in the literature (including Unicode), with the foot down, is rotated compared with the sign on the disc, with the foot up. \n\nIf one assumes the rotations are completely randomly distributed, then the probability that they end up in only two (or three) signs is very small. This suggests that these rotations might be deliberate.<ref>ten Cate, Arie, \"A statistical analysis of the rotated signs of the Phaistos Disc\", ''Pioneer Journal of Theoretical and Applied Statistics'', Vol 6, Issue 2, pp.81-88 (2013)</ref>\n\n===Signs in adjacent windings===\nThere are several occurrences on side A where the same sign is at two places near each other in adjacent windings of the spiral. For example, consider the Plumed Head (sign 02) in word A1 and the Plumed Head in word A14. Three patterns of such occurrences have been identified. A computer analysis of one of them (involving most of the Plumed Head signs on side A) has been performed with the conclusion that the probability of this pattern being coincidental is small. The existence of the two other patterns further decreases the probability of coincidence.<ref>ten Cate, Arie, \"Patterns on an ancient artifact: a coincidence?\", ''Statistica Neerlandica'', Vol 65, pp.116\u2013124 (2011) {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9574.2010.00478.x}}</ref>\n\nSeveral occurrences are caused by a [[#Corrections|correction]]. Also, the orientation of the signs seems to be relevant: the two Hides (sign 27) in word A29 are upside down, with the \"heads\" pointing to the Hide sign in the adjacent winding in word A23.\n\nIf this is indeed not coincidental then the inscription is not a one-dimensional text. Of course this does not give us a decipherment; rather it narrows down the potential decipherments.\n\n==Decipherment attempts==\n{{further|Phaistos Disc decipherment claims}}\n\nA great deal of speculation developed around the disc during the twentieth century. The Phaistos Disc captured the imagination of amateur archeologists. Many attempts have been made to [[decipher]] the code behind the disc's signs. Historically, almost anything has been proposed, including prayers, a narrative or an adventure story, a \"[[psaltery|psalterion]]\", a call to arms, a [[board game]], and a geometric [[theorem]]. Some of the more fanciful interpretations of its meaning are classic examples of [[pseudoarchaeology]].\n\nMost linguistic interpretations assume a [[syllabary]], based on the proportion of 45 symbols in a text of 241 tokens typical for that type of script; some assume a syllabary with interspersed [[logographic]] symbols, a property of every known syllabary of the [[Ancient Near East]] ([[Linear B]] as well as [[cuneiform]] and [[hieroglyph]]ic writing). There are, however, also alphabetic and purely logographical interpretations.\n\nWhile enthusiasts still believe the mystery can be solved, scholarly attempts at decipherment are thought to be unlikely to succeed unless more examples of the signs turn up somewhere, as it is generally thought that there is not enough context available for meaningful analysis. Any decipherment without external confirmation, such as successful comparison to other inscriptions, is unlikely to be accepted as conclusive.\n\n===Origin of the script===\n====Cretan or foreign origin?====\nThere are a few main theories about the origin of the signs. For the first few decades after its discovery most scholars argued strongly against the local origin of the artifact. Evans (1909:24f.) wrote that\n{{quote|when one comes to compare the figures in detail with those of the [[Minoan hieroglyphic signary]], very great discrepancy is observable... Out of the forty-five separate signs on the Phaistos Disk, no more than ten more or less resemble Cretan hieroglyphic forms... The human figures in their outline and costume are non-Minoan... The representation of the ship also differs from all similar designs that occur either among the hieroglyphic or the linear documents of Crete.\n}}\n\nGlotz (1925:381) claimed that the clay was not from Crete. Ipsen (1929:15) concluded that the Disc was certainly from somewhere on the Aegean. Because of its differences from Linear A or B, Ipsen found it tempting to assume, like Evans, a non-Cretan origin for the Disc. He observes, however, that since Linear A was a common Aegean script such an assumption will not resolve the problem of multiplicity.\n\nThe [[Arkalochori Axe]] and other finds have made Cretan origin more popular: female images with pendulous breasts have also been found at Malia and Phaistos. (Godart 1995:125).  Duhoux asserts the Cretan ''provenance'' of the disc; in his review of current research, Trauth (1990:154) concludes that \"Crete as [the] source of the Disc can no longer be called into question.\" [[W. Andrew Robinson|Andrew Robinson]] (2008), in a review in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', wrote \"Most scholars today, including Duhoux, think it a plausible working hypothesis that the disc was made in Crete.\"\n\n====Original invention or derivation?====\nIpsen (1929:11) also speaks  against an entirely independent origin of the scripts, arguing that its inventors did not leap from no knowledge of writing to a syllabic script with these elegant signs. He goes on to cite [[Anatolian hieroglyph|Hieroglyphic Luwian]] as a \"perfect parallel\" (Ipsen 1929:17) of an original script inspired under the direct influence of other scripts (its symbol values inspired by [[cuneiform]], its shapes by [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s)\n\nSchwartz (1956:108) asserts a genetic relationship between the Phaistos Disc script and the Cretan linear scripts.\n\nAmong the known scripts, there are three main candidates for being related to the Disc's script, all of them partly syllabic, partly logographic: [[Linear A]], [[Anatolian hieroglyph]]s and Egyptian hieroglyphs. More remote possibilities are comparison with the [[Phoenician abjad]] or the [[Byblos syllabary]].\n\n====Linear A====\nSome signs are close enough to both [[Linear A]] and [[Linear B]] that they may have the same phonetic values, as [[Image:Phaistos glyph 12.svg|40x30px|12]] 12 = ''qe'', [[Image:Phaistos glyph 43.svg|40x30px|43]] 43 = ''ta''<sub>2</sub>, or [[Image:Phaistos glyph 31.svg|40x30px|31]] 31 = ''ku''. But this opinion is not shared by all specialists of the Aegean Scripts.\nA recent systematic comparison with Linear A is that of  Torsten Timm, 2004.<ref name=\"Timm2004\" />  Based on the [[Linear A]] character distribution patterns collected by Facchetti<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Statistical data and morphematic elements in Linear A|first=Giulio M.|last=Facchetti|journal=Kadmos|issue= Vol. 38, No. 2. (1999)}}</ref> Timm concludes that the language of the Disc inscription is the same as the language of Linear A. Timm identifies 20 of the 45 characters with Linear signs, assigning Linear B phonetic values to 16.\n\n====Anatolian hieroglyphs====\nAchterberg et al. (2004) present a systematic comparison with [[Anatolian hieroglyph]]s, resulting in a full decipherment claim (see below). In particular, they consider the stroke symbol cognate to the [[Luwian language|Luwian]] ''r(a/i)'' symbol, but assign it the value ''-ti''. The stroke on A3 is identified as the personal name determinative. [[Image:Phaistos glyph 01.svg|40x30px|01]] 01 is compared to the [[logogram]] ''SARU'', a walking man or walking legs in Luwian. [[Image:Phaistos glyph 02.svg|40x30px|02]] 02 is compared to word-initial ''a<sub>2</sub>'', a head with a crown in Luwian. The \"bow\" [[Image:Phaistos glyph 11.svg|40x30px|11]] 11 is identified as the logogram ''sol suus'', the [[winged sun]] known from Luwian royal seals. The \"shield\" [[Image:Phaistos glyph 12.svg|40x30px|12]] 12 is compared to the near identical Luwian logogram ''TURPI'' \"bread\" and assigned the value ''tu''.  [[Image:Phaistos glyph 39.svg|40x30px|39]] 39 they read as the \"[[thunderbolt]]\", logogram of [[Tarhunt]], in Luwian a W-shaped hieroglyph.\n\n=== List of decipherment claims ===\n{{main|Phaistos Disc decipherment claims}}\n\nThe decipherment claims listed are categorized into linguistic decipherments, identifying the language of the inscription, and non-linguistic decipherments. A purely [[logogram|logographical]] reading is not linguistic in the strict sense: while it may reveal the meaning of the inscription, it will not allow for the identification of the underlying language.\n\n====Linguistic====\n* [[George Hempl]], 1911 (interpretation as [[Ionic Greek]], syllabic writing); A-side first; reading inward;\n* [[Florence Stawell]], 1911 (interpretation as [[Homeric Greek]], syllabic writing); B-side first; reading inward;\n* [[Albert Cuny]], 1914 (interpretation as an ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] document, syllabic-logographic writing);\n* [[Benjamin Schwarz (archaeologist)|Benjamin Schwarz]], 1959 (interpretation as Mycenean Greek, syllabic writing, comparison to Linear B); A-side first; reading inward;\n* [[Jean Faucounau]], 1975,  (interpretation as \"[[proto-Ionic]]\" Greek, syllabic writing [https://web.archive.org/web/20060314222548/http://www.robotwisdom.com/science/phaistos/]; A-side first; reading inward;\n* [[Vladimir I.

The disk is about 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;in) in diameter and covered on both sides with a spiral of stamped symbols. Its purpose and meaning, and even its original geographical place of manufacture, remain disputed, making it one of the most famous mysteries of [[archaeology]]. This unique object is now on display at the [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum|archaeological museum]] of [[Heraklion]].\n\nThe disc was discovered in 1908 by the Italian archaeologist [[Luigi Pernier]] in the Minoan palace-site of Phaistos, and features 241 tokens, comprising 45 distinct signs, which were apparently made by pressing hieroglyphic \"seals\" into a disc of soft clay, in a clockwise sequence spiraling toward the center of the disk.\n\nThe Phaistos Disc captured the imagination of amateur and professional archaeologists, and many [[Phaistos Disc decipherment claims|attempts have been made to decipher the code]] behind the disc's signs. While it is not clear that it is a script, most attempted [[decipherment]]s assume that it is; most additionally assume a [[syllabary]], others an [[alphabet]] or [[logography]]. Attempts at decipherment are generally thought to be unlikely to succeed unless more examples of the signs are found, as it is generally agreed that there is not enough context available for a meaningful analysis.\n\nAlthough the Phaistos Disc is generally accepted as authentic by archaeologists, a few scholars believe that the disc is a [[forgery]] or a [[hoax]].\n\n==Discovery==\n[[Image:Table Ph1.png|thumb|250px|Tablet PH-1]]The Phaistos Disc was discovered in the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] palace-site of [[Phaistos]], near [[Hagia Triada]], on the south coast of [[Crete]];<ref>[http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10857/phaistos.html#fieldnotes C.Michael Hogan, ''Phaistos fieldnotes'', The Modern Antiquarian, 2007]</ref> specifically the disc was found in the basement of room 8 in building 101 of a group of buildings to the northeast of the main palace. This grouping of four rooms also served as a formal entry into the palace complex.  [[Italy|Italian]] archaeologist [[Luigi Pernier]] recovered the intact \"dish\", about {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and uniformly slightly more than {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=off}} in thickness, on 3 July 1908 during his [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] of the first Minoan palace.\n\nIt was found in the main cell of an underground \"temple depository\". These basement cells, only accessible from above, were neatly covered with a layer of fine [[plaster]]. Their content was poor in precious artifacts, but rich in black earth and ashes, mixed with burnt [[bovine]] bones. In the northern part of the main cell, in the same black layer, a few cenitmetres south-east of the disc and about {{cvt|50|cm|abbr=off}} above the floor, [[Linear A]] tablet ''PH 1'' was also found. The site apparently collapsed as a result of an [[earthquake]], possibly linked with the  [[Minoan eruption|eruption]] of the [[Santorini]] volcano that affected large parts of the [[Mediterranean region]] during the mid second millennium B.C.\n\n=== Authenticity ===\nThe Phaistos Disc is generally accepted as authentic by archaeologists.<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell-Dunn|first=Graham|title=Who Were the Minoans?|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2006|pages=207|isbn=978-1-4259-2007-4}}</ref> The assumption of authenticity is based on the excavation records by Luigi Pernier. This assumption is supported by the later discovery of the [[Arkalochori Axe]] with similar but not identical glyphs.<ref name=\"Timm2004\" />\n\nThe possibility that the disc is a 1908 [[archaeological forgery|forgery]] or hoax has been raised by two scholars.<ref name=\"Robinson:2008\">Robinson:2008</ref><ref name=\"Eisenberg2008A\">{{Cite journal | last = Eisenberg | first = Jerome M. | title = The Phaistos Disk: one hundred year old hoax? | journal = Minerva | issue = July/August | year = 2008 | pages = 9\u201324}}</ref><ref name=\"Eisenberg2008B\">{{Cite journal | last = Eisenberg | first = Jerome M. | title = Phaistos Disk: A 100-Year-Old Hoax?

([[Minoan chronology|MMIII]]) on the basis of Luigi Pernier's report, which says that the Disc was in a  Middle Minoan undisturbed context. Jeppesen (1963) dates it to after 1400 ([[Minoan chronology|LMII-III]]). Doubting the viability of Pernier's report, [[Louis Godart]] (1990) resigns himself to admitting that archaeologically, the disc may be dated to anywhere in Middle or Late Minoan times (MMI-LMIII, a period spanning most of the [[second millennium B.C.]]). J. Best suggests a date in the first half of the fourteenth century B.C. (LMIIIA) based on his dating of tablet PH 1.<ref name=\"AchterbergSociety2004\">{{cite book|author1=Winfried Achterberg|author2=Dutch Archaeological and Historical Society|title=The Phaistos disc: a Luwian letter to Nestor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9hmAAAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Dutch Archaeological and Historical Society|isbn=978-90-72067-11-1}}</ref>\n\n== Typography ==\nThe inscription was apparently made by pressing hieroglyphic \"seals\" into the soft clay, in a clockwise sequence spiraling toward the center of the disk. It was then fired at high temperature. The unique character of the Phaistos Disc stems from the fact that the entire text was inscribed in this way, reproducing a body of text with reusable characters.\n\nThe German typesetter and linguist [[Herbert Brekle]], in his article \"The typographic principle\" in the ''[[Gutenberg-Jahrbuch]]'', argues that the Phaistos Disc is an early document of [[movable type]] printing, since it meets the essential criterion of [[typographic]] printing, that of type identity:\n\n{{quote|An early clear incidence for the realization of the typographic principle is the notorious Phaistos Disc (ca. 1800\u20131600 B.C.). If the disc is, as assumed, a textual representation, we are really dealing with a \"printed\" text, which fulfills all definitional criteria of the typographic principle. The spiral sequencing of the graphematical units, the fact that they are impressed in a clay disc (blind printing!) and not imprinted are merely possible technological variants of textual representation. The decisive factor is that the material \"types\" are proven to be repeatedly instantiated on the clay disc.<ref>[[Herbert E.

Of the eight twice-occurring symbols, four (03, 21, 28, 41) occur on side A only, three (09, 16, 20) on side B only, and only one (14) on both sides.\n\n===Oblique stroke signs===\nThere are a number of signs marked with an oblique stroke; the strokes are not imprinted but carved by hand, and are attached to the first or last sign of a \"word\", depending on the direction of reading chosen. Their meaning is a matter of discussion. One hypothesis, supported by Evans, Duhoux, Ohlenroth and others, is that they were used to subdivide the text into paragraphs, but alternative meanings have been offered by other scholars.\n\n===Directionality===\nEvans, at one point, published an assertion that the disc had been written, and should be read, from the center out; because it would have been easiest to place the inscription first and then size the disc to fit the text. There is general agreement that he was wrong, and Evans himself later changed his mind: the inscription was made, and should be read, from the outside in toward the centre. The centres of the spirals are not in the centre of the disc, and some of the symbols near the centre are crowded, as though the maker was cramped for space. One pair of symbols are set top-to-bottom, so it is hard to tell what order they should be in. Except in the cramped section, when there are overstrikes, the inner symbol overlies the outer symbol. Jean Faucounau has proposed a reconstruction of the scribe's movements, which would also require an inward direction; Yves Duhoux says that any outward reading may be discarded. Despite this consensus, there are still a few such attempted decipherments (See [[Phaistos Disc decipherment claims]]).\n\nIn addition to the question of the directionality of the text on the disc itself, different viewpoints are held as to how the Phaistos Disc characters should be displayed when transcribed into text. The disc itself probably has right-to-left directionality, if reading proceeds from the outside to the centre; this means that the reading direction is into the faces of the people and animals, as it is in Egyptian and Anatolian. Phaistos Disc characters are shown with left-to-right directionality in this article, with the glyphs mirrored compared to their orientation on the disc; which is also the typical practice for edited Egyptian and Anatolian hieroglyphic text.\n\n===Inscription text===\nThe following is a rendering of the Phaistos Disc inscription in [[Unicode]] characters (the text will only be displayed correctly if a font that supports Unicode Phaistos Disc characters, such as [[Noto Sans|Noto Sans Symbols]] or [[Everson Mono]] is installed):\n\nSide A\n\n<span style=\"font-size:140%;\">\u00a6 \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\udddc\ud800\uddd0\ud800\udde1\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\udde7\ud800\uddf7\ud800\udddb | \ud800\uddec\ud800\uddfc\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddec\ud800\uddec\ud800\uddf1 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddd3\ud800\uddf7\ud800\uddf0 | \ud800\uddea\ud800\uddfc\ud800\uddd6\ud800\udddb | \ud800\uddea\ud800\uddfb\ud800\uddd7 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddd5\ud800\udde1[.] | \ud800\uddee\ud800\udde9\ud800\uddf2 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddf8\ud800\udde2\ud800\uddf2 | \ud800\uddd0\ud800\uddf8\ud800\uddf7\ud800\uddd6 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddef\ud800\udde6\ud800\uddf5\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddf6\ud800\uddda | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\uddea\ud800\udde8\ud800\uddd9\ud800\udde6\ud800\udde1 | \ud800\uddeb\ud800\uddd0\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddee\ud800\udde9\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddea\ud800\uddea\ud800\uddf2\ud800\uddf4\ud800\udde4 | \ud800\uddf0\ud800\udde6 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddee\ud800\udde9\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\uddea\ud800\udde8\ud800\uddd9\ud800\udde6\ud800\udde1 | \ud800\uddeb\ud800\uddd0\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddee\ud800\udde9\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddea\ud800\udddd\ud800\uddef\ud800\udde1\ud800\uddea | \ud800\uddd5\ud800\udde1\ud800\udde0\ud800\udde2 | \ud800\uddee\ud800\udde9\ud800\udddb | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\udddc\ud800\uddd0 | \ud800\udde6\ud800\udde2\ud800\uddf2\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd9\ud800\uddd2\ud800\uddf5 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\uddea\ud800\uddea\ud800\uddf2\ud800\uddf4\ud800\udde4 | \ud800\udddc\ud800\uddd0 | \ud800\uddd9\ud800\uddd2\ud800\uddf5 |</span>\n\nSide B\n\n<span style=\"font-size:140%;\">\u00a6 \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udddb\ud800\udde5\ud800\uddf7\ud800\uddd6 | \ud800\uddea\ud800\uddfc\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddf2 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\uddf4\ud800\udde6\ud800\uddd4\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\udde5\ud800\udde8\ud800\uddea | \ud800\uddf0\ud800\udde7\ud800\udde3\ud800\udddb | \ud800\udddf\ud800\udde6\ud800\udde1\ud800\uddfa\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\udddc\ud800\uddd0\ud800\uddf6\ud800\uddf0 | \ud800\uddde\ud800\uddd6\ud800\udddc\ud800\uddd0\ud800\udde1 | \ud800\udde5\ud800\uddf4\ud800\uddf9\ud800\udde8 | \ud800\uddd6\ud800\udde7\ud800\uddf7\ud800\uddf2 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\udde9\ud800\uddf3\ud800\uddf7 | \ud800\uddea\ud800\udde8\ud800\uddf5\ud800\uddd0 | \ud800\uddec\ud800\udde7\ud800\udde7\ud800\udde3\ud800\uddf2 | \ud800\udddf\ud800\udddd\ud800\udde1 | \ud800\uddec\ud800\uddf0\ud800\uddd0 | \ud800\uddd5\ud800\uddf2\ud800\uddef\ud800\uddf6\ud800\uddf0 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\uddd8\ud800\uddea\ud800\uddd0 | \ud800\uddec\ud800\uddf3\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddd7\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddec\ud800\uddd7\ud800\udddc | \ud800\uddec\ud800\uddfc\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\udde5\ud800\uddec\ud800\uddf3\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddd7\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddea\ud800\uddf1\ud800\udde6\ud800\udde8 | \ud800\uddd6\ud800\udde1\ud800\uddf2 | \ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddfc\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd6\ud800\udde6\ud800\udde1\ud800\udde7 | \ud800\udde5\ud800\uddec\ud800\uddf3\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddd7\ud800\uddfd | \ud800\uddd8\ud800\udded\ud800\uddf6\ud800\udde1\ud800\uddd6 | \ud800\uddd1\ud800\uddd5\ud800\uddf2\ud800\udde6\ud800\uddd6 | \ud800\uddec\ud800\uddf1\ud800\udde6\ud800\udde8 | \ud800\uddfc\ud800\uddd6\ud800\uddfd |</span>\n\n[[File:PhaistosDiskTranscribed.png|center|frame|Width200|Image of the transcription for those who do not have the appropriate fonts installed.]]\n\n[[File:Discos Phaitos Umzeichnung.png|thumb|Fields numbering by Louis Godart]]\nThere are 61 \"words\", 31 on side A and 30 on side B (numbered A1 to A31 and B1 to B30, outside to inside), here read outside-to-inside (putting the \"plumed head\" signs word-initially and the strokes word-finally). The shortest words are two symbols in length, the longest seven symbols. The strokes are here transcribed as diagonal strokes (/). The transcription begins at the vertical line of five dots, circling the rim of the disc once, clockwise (13 words on A, 12 words on B) before spiralling toward the center (18 more words on each side). There is one word-final effaced sign at A8, which Godart (1995:101) notes as resembling sign 3 or 20; or less probably 8 or 44. Evans considered side A as the front side, but technical arguments have since been forwarded favouring side B as the front side.\n\nThe signs in the transcription below appear in left-to-right

word-initially, in 13 instances followed by the \"shield\" (12, which in some instances also occurs word-finally). Six words occur twice each:\nThe three-word sequence 02-27-25-10-23-18 28-01/ 02-12-31-26/ occurs twice (A14-16, A20-22). 02-12-31-26/ recurs for a third time (A19). Four more words occur twice each, 02-12-27-27-35-37-21 (A17, A29), 10-03-38 (A28, A31), 22-29-36-07-08/ (B21, B26) and 29-45-07/ (A3, B20).\n\n===Corrections===\nAs noted [[#Signs|above]], corrections have been made. Signs have been erased and over-printed by other signs.\n\nGodart (1995:99-107) describes these corrections, by word.\nThey occur in the following words: A1 (signs 02-12-13-01), A4 (29-29-34) together with A5 (02-12-04), A8 (12), A10 (02-41-19?-35), A12 (12), A16 (12-31-26?), A17 (second 27?), A29 (second 27?), B1 (12-22), B3 (37?), B4 (22-25 imprinted over the same), B10 (07?-24?-40?), B13 (beside 29?). Question marks indicate uncertainty about that particular sign being the result of a correction.\n\nAlso, the borders of word B28 has been widened to make room for sign 02. See Duhoux (1977:34-35) and Godart (1995:107).\n\n=== Rotations ===\n\nThe two signs 27 (Hide) in word A29 are rotated 180 degrees compared with all other occurrences of this sign: \"head down\" versus \"head up\". This rotation might be motivated by lack of space in A29; see Duhoux (1977), p.24 (section 6A-8). \n\nThe rotations of the signs 29 (Cat) and 31 (Eagle) have no lack of space. Defining the sign 29 in words B19, B20 and B21 as \"head to the right\", we have: head down in B29; head to the left in A3 and B15; head up in B18 and B26; head in between up and left in B13; head in between right and down in A4 (twice). The direction of the head of sign 31 is as follows: to the right in A16, up in A9 and A25, and to the left in A22.\n\nThe sign 02 (Plumed head) in word A29 is 90 degrees rotated to the right compared with all other occurrences of this sign. This might well be due to lack of space; the word is crowded and messy, with the sign 12 (Shield) pushed aside. \n\nThe two occurrences of sign 28 (Bull's leg) are not rotated compared with each other. Rather, the way this sign is shown in the literature (including Unicode), with the foot down, is rotated compared with the sign on the disc, with the foot up. \n\nIf one assumes the rotations are completely randomly distributed, then the probability that they end up in only two (or three) signs is very small. This suggests that these rotations might be deliberate.<ref>ten Cate, Arie, \"A statistical analysis of the rotated signs of the Phaistos Disc\", ''Pioneer Journal of Theoretical and Applied Statistics'', Vol 6, Issue 2, pp.81-88 (2013)</ref>\n\n===Signs in adjacent windings===\nThere are several occurrences on side A where the same sign is at two places near each other in adjacent windings of the spiral. For example, consider the Plumed Head (sign 02) in word A1 and the Plumed Head in word A14. Three patterns of such occurrences have been identified. A computer analysis of one of them (involving most of the Plumed Head signs on side A) has been performed with the conclusion that the probability of this pattern being coincidental is small. The existence of the two other patterns further decreases the probability of coincidence.<ref>ten Cate, Arie, \"Patterns on an ancient artifact: a coincidence?\", ''Statistica Neerlandica'', Vol 65, pp.116\u2013124 (2011) {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9574.2010.00478.x}}</ref>\n\nSeveral occurrences are caused by a [[#Corrections|correction]]. Also, the orientation of the signs seems to be relevant: the two Hides (sign 27) in word A29 are upside down, with the \"heads\" pointing to the Hide sign in the adjacent winding in word A23.\n\nIf this is indeed not coincidental then the inscription is not a one-dimensional text. Of course this does not give us a decipherment; rather it narrows down the potential decipherments.\n\n==Decipherment attempts==\n{{further|Phaistos Disc decipherment claims}}\n\nA great deal of speculation developed around the disc during the twentieth century. The Phaistos Disc captured the imagination of amateur archeologists. Many attempts have been made to [[decipher]] the code behind the disc's signs. Historically, almost anything has been proposed, including prayers, a narrative or an adventure story, a \"[[psaltery|psalterion]]\", a call to arms, a [[board game]], and a geometric [[theorem]]. Some of the more fanciful interpretations of its meaning are classic examples of [[pseudoarchaeology]].\n\nMost linguistic interpretations assume a [[syllabary]], based on the proportion of 45 symbols in a text of 241 tokens typical for that type of script; some assume a syllabary with interspersed [[logographic]] symbols, a property of every known syllabary of the [[Ancient Near East]] ([[Linear B]] as well as [[cuneiform]] and [[hieroglyph]]ic writing). There are, however, also alphabetic and purely logographical interpretations.\n\nWhile enthusiasts still believe the mystery can be solved, scholarly attempts at decipherment are thought to be unlikely to succeed unless more examples of the signs turn up somewhere, as it is generally thought that there is not enough context available for meaningful analysis. Any decipherment without external confirmation, such as successful comparison to other inscriptions, is unlikely to be accepted as conclusive.\n\n===Origin of the script===\n====Cretan or foreign origin?====\nThere are a few main theories about the origin of the signs. For the first few decades after its discovery most scholars argued strongly against the local origin of the artifact. Evans (1909:24f.) wrote that\n{{quote|when one comes to compare the figures in detail with those of the [[Minoan hieroglyphic signary]], very great discrepancy is observable... Out of the forty-five separate signs on the Phaistos Disk, no more than ten more or less resemble Cretan hieroglyphic forms... The human figures in their outline and costume are non-Minoan... The representation of the ship also differs from all similar designs that occur either among the hieroglyphic or the linear documents of Crete.\n}}\n\nGlotz (1925:381) claimed that the clay was not from Crete. Ipsen (1929:15) concluded that the Disc was certainly from somewhere on the Aegean. Because of its differences from Linear A or B, Ipsen found it tempting to assume, like Evans, a non-Cretan origin for the Disc. He observes, however, that since Linear A was a common Aegean script such an assumption will not resolve the problem of multiplicity.\n\nThe [[Arkalochori Axe]] and other finds have made Cretan origin more popular: female images with pendulous breasts have also been found at Malia and Phaistos. (Godart 1995:125).  Duhoux asserts the Cretan ''provenance'' of the disc; in his review of current research, Trauth (1990:154) concludes that \"Crete as [the] source of the Disc can no longer be called into question.\" [[W. Andrew Robinson|Andrew Robinson]] (2008), in a review in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', wrote \"Most scholars today, including Duhoux, think it a plausible working hypothesis that the disc was made in Crete.\"\n\n====Original invention or derivation?====\nIpsen (1929:11) also speaks  against an entirely independent origin of the scripts, arguing that its inventors did not leap from no knowledge of writing to a syllabic script with these elegant signs. He goes on to cite [[Anatolian hieroglyph|Hieroglyphic Luwian]] as a \"perfect parallel\" (Ipsen 1929:17) of an original script inspired under the direct influence of other scripts (its symbol values inspired by [[cuneiform]], its shapes by [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s)\n\nSchwartz (1956:108) asserts a genetic relationship between the Phaistos Disc script and the Cretan linear scripts.\n\nAmong the known scripts, there are three main candidates for being related to the Disc's script, all of them partly syllabic, partly logographic: [[Linear A]], [[Anatolian hieroglyph]]s and Egyptian hieroglyphs. More remote possibilities are comparison with the [[Phoenician abjad]] or the [[Byblos syllabary]].\n\n====Linear A====\nSome signs are close enough to both [[Linear A]] and [[Linear B]] that they may have the same phonetic values, as [[Image:Phaistos glyph 12.svg|40x30px|12]] 12 = ''qe'', [[Image:Phaistos glyph 43.svg|40x30px|43]] 43 = ''ta''<sub>2</sub>, or [[Image:Phaistos glyph 31.svg|40x30px|31]] 31 = ''ku''. But this opinion is not shared by all specialists of the Aegean Scripts.\nA recent systematic comparison with Linear A is that of  Torsten Timm, 2004.<ref name=\"Timm2004\" />  Based on the [[Linear A]] character distribution patterns collected by Facchetti<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Statistical data and morphematic elements in Linear A|first=Giulio M.|last=Facchetti|journal=Kadmos|issue= Vol. 38, No. 2. (1999)}}</ref> Timm concludes that the language of the Disc inscription is the same as the language of Linear A. Timm identifies 20 of the 45 characters with Linear signs, assigning Linear B phonetic values to 16.\n\n====Anatolian hieroglyphs====\nAchterberg et al. (2004) present a systematic comparison with [[Anatolian hieroglyph]]s, resulting in a full decipherment claim (see below). In particular, they consider the stroke symbol cognate to the [[Luwian language|Luwian]] ''r(a/i)'' symbol, but assign it the value ''-ti''. The stroke on A3 is identified as the personal name determinative. [[Image:Phaistos glyph 01.svg|40x30px|01]] 01 is compared to the [[logogram]] ''SARU'', a walking man or walking legs in Luwian. [[Image:Phaistos glyph 02.svg|40x30px|02]] 02 is compared to word-initial ''a<sub>2</sub>'', a head with a crown in Luwian. The \"bow\" [[Image:Phaistos glyph 11.svg|40x30px|11]] 11 is identified as the logogram ''sol suus'', the [[winged sun]] known from Luwian royal seals. The \"shield\" [[Image:Phaistos glyph 12.svg|40x30px|12]] 12 is compared to the near identical Luwian logogram ''TURPI'' \"bread\" and assigned the value ''tu''.  [[Image:Phaistos glyph 39.svg|40x30px|39]] 39 they read as the \"[[thunderbolt]]\", logogram of [[Tarhunt]], in Luwian a W-shaped hieroglyph.\n\n=== List of decipherment claims ===\n{{main|Phaistos Disc decipherment claims}}\n\nThe decipherment claims listed are categorized into linguistic decipherments, identifying the language of the inscription, and non-linguistic decipherments. A purely [[logogram|logographical]] reading is not linguistic in the strict sense: while it may reveal the meaning of the inscription, it will not allow for the identification of the underlying language.\n\n====Linguistic====\n* [[George Hempl]], 1911 (interpretation as [[Ionic Greek]], syllabic writing); A-side first; reading inward;\n* [[Florence Stawell]], 1911 (interpretation as [[Homeric Greek]], syllabic writing); B-side first; reading inward;\n* [[Albert Cuny]], 1914 (interpretation as an ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] document, syllabic-logographic writing);\n* [[Benjamin Schwarz (archaeologist)|Benjamin Schwarz]], 1959 (interpretation as Mycenean Greek, syllabic writing, comparison to Linear B); A-side first; reading inward;\n* [[Jean Faucounau]], 1975,  (interpretation as \"[[proto-Ionic]]\" Greek, syllabic writing [https://web.archive.org/web/20060314222548/http://www.robotwisdom.com/science/phaistos/]; A-side first; reading inward;\n* [[Vladimir I.

It was initially  raised for service during the First World War as part the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] and saw action at [[Gallipoli campaign|Gallipoli]] before being sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in mid-1916, where it spent the next two-and-a-half years taking part in the fighting in the trenches of France and Belgium. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the battalion was disbanded in early 1919 as part of the demobilisation process.\n\nIn 1921, the battalion was re-raised as a part-time unit of the [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizens Forces]] based in [[Newcastle, New South Wales]], drawing lineage from a number of previously existing infantry units. They remained in existence until 1929 when, due to austerity measures during the [[Great Depression]] and manpower shortages, the battalion was amalgamated with two other infantry battalions over the course of a number of re-organisations. It was re-formed in 1939 and undertook garrison duty in Australia during the Second World War until 1943 when it was merged once again.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, the 2nd Battalion was re-raised as part of the Citizens Military Force in 1948.

Early in the action all his company officers were either killed or wounded with the assault such that the company and Brigade became somewhat disorganised. Sgt Brew skilfully took charge and boldly led his company through the village into the position they were to locate. On reaching his place in the line he personally reported to the nearest Co. Commander, and assisted materially in the work of consolidation.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/awm-media/collection/RCDIG1067899/document/5484172.PDF|title=Australian War Memorial Awards and Recommendations|last=|first=|date=April 24|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe two companies passed through hedges and the ruined buildings, clearing the outskirts of the village with little resistance.

It was initially  raised for service during the First World War as part the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] and saw action at [[Gallipoli campaign|Gallipoli]] before being sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in mid-1916, where it spent the next two-and-a-half years taking part in the fighting in the trenches of France and Belgium. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the battalion was disbanded in early 1919 as part of the demobilisation process.\n\nIn 1921, the battalion was re-raised as a part-time unit of the [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizens Forces]] based in [[Newcastle, New South Wales]], drawing lineage from a number of previously existing infantry units. They remained in existence until 1929 when, due to austerity measures during the [[Great Depression]] and manpower shortages, the battalion was amalgamated with two other infantry battalions over the course of a number of re-organisations. It was re-formed in 1939 and undertook garrison duty in Australia during the Second World War until 1943 when it was merged once again.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, the 2nd Battalion was re-raised as part of the Citizens Military Force in 1948. In 1960, it was reduced to a [[Company (military unit)|company]]-level formation but was re-formed as a battalion of the [[Royal New South Wales Regiment]] in 1965. It remained on the Australian order of battle until 1987 when it was amalgamated with the [[17th Battalion (Australia)|17th Battalion]], to form the [[2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment]], a unit which remains part of the Australian Army Reserve today.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==History==\n\n===First World War===\n\n====Formation and training====\nThe 2nd Battalion was raised at [[Randwick, New South Wales]], in August 1914 as part of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF), which was formed from volunteers for overseas service shortly after the outbreak of the First World War.<ref>{{harvnb|Grey|2008|pp=85 & 88}}.</ref> Drawing the majority of its personnel from the [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Hunter Region|Hunter Valley]] regions of the state of [[New South Wales]],<ref>{{harvnb|Bean|1941a|p=41}}.</ref><ref name=offorbat>{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080820024259/http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-army-today/state-regts/rnswr-off-orbat.htm |url= http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-army-today/state-regts/rnswr-off-orbat.htm |title=Off Orbat RNSWR Battalions |author=Harris, Ted |publisher=Digger History |archivedate=20 August 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> the battalion formed part of the [[1st Brigade (Australia)|1st Brigade]] and, along with the [[1st Battalion (Australia)|1st]], [[3rd Battalion (Australia)|3rd]] and [[4th Battalion (Australia)|4th Battalions]],<ref>{{harvnb|Kuring|2004|p=90}}.</ref> it was one of the first infantry units raised by Australia following its entry into the war.<ref name=AWM>{{cite web |url= http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11189.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910025034/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11189.asp|title=2nd Battalion |work=First World War, 1914\u20131918 units |publisher= Australian War Memorial|archivedate=10 September 2011|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> Upon formation, the battalion was established with a complement of over 1,000 men organised into a headquarters, a machine-gun section of two heavy Maxim medium machine-guns, and eight rifle companies, each consisting of three officers and 117 other ranks.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|Cusack|1942|p=29}}.</ref><ref name=Ryan11>{{harvnb|Ryan|2003|p=11}}.</ref> The battalion's first [[commanding officer]] was Lieutenant Colonel [[George Braund]],<ref name=AWM/> a citizen soldier and [[Member of Parliament]] in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]], who held the seat of [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bean|1941a|p=52}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:C Company Australian 2nd Battalion 1914 AWM P00056.001.jpg|left|thumb| Group shot of 'C' Company, 2nd Battalion, in [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington, Sydney]], October 1914 |alt=A group of soldiers standing, kneeling or lying down in a group photograph]]\n\nThe physical standards under which the first contingent of the AIF was recruited were very strict, nevertheless by the end of August over 20,000 men had been recruited into one infantry division\u2014the [[1st Division (Australia)|1st Division]]\u2014and one light horse brigade, the [[1st Light Horse Brigade]].<ref>{{harvnb|Grey|2008|p=88}}.</ref> Following a brief period of training in Australia, the force set sail for the Middle East, assembling off [[Albany, Western Australia]], in early November 1914 before leaving Australian waters,<ref>{{harvnb|Grey|2008|p=91}}.</ref> with the 2nd Battalion embarked upon the HMAT ''Suffolk''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Mallett, Ross |url= http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8888/Infantry.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927100355/http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8888/Infantry.html|title=Part B: Branches&nbsp;\u2013 Infantry Battalions |work= First AIF Order of Battle 1914\u20131918 |publisher=Australian Defence Force Academy |accessdate=2 January 2012|archivedate=27 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nInitially it had been planned that the Australians would be sent to the United Kingdom, where they would undertake further training prior to being sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France and Belgium. However, the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s entry into the war on Germany's side on 29 October meant that the strategically vital [[Suez Canal]] was threatened, and as a result of this and overcrowding in training grounds in the United Kingdom, upon the convoy reaching the Suez at the end of November, plans for the use of the Australian force were changed and they were disembarked in [[Egypt]] instead.<ref>{{harvnb|Grey|2008|p=92}}.</ref>\n\nThe 2nd Battalion arrived in Egypt on 2 December.<ref name=AWM/> The following month, it undertook further training along with the rest of the 1st Division.

Although the battalion's authorised strength remained the same, the eight companies were merged into four, each consisting of six officers and 221 other ranks.<ref name=Ryan11/>\n\nIn February 1915, Ottoman Empire forces [[First Suez Offensive|attacked the Suez Canal]],<ref>{{harvnb|Grey|2008|p=93}}.</ref> and although some units of the 1st Division were put into the line,{{#tag:ref|The [[7th Battalion (Australia)|7th]] and [[8th Battalion (Australia)|8th Battalions]] from the [[2nd Brigade (Australia)|2nd Brigade]] were dispatched to man defensive positions.<ref name=Beana164>{{harvnb|Bean|1941a|p=164}}.</ref>  |group=Note}} the 2nd Battalion was not required, and in the end the attack was turned back mainly by Indian units.<ref name=Beana164/> Later, in an effort to open shipping lanes to the Russians and also knock the Turks out of the war, the British high command decided to land a force on the [[Gallipoli|Gallipoli peninsula]] near the [[Dardanelles]] using mainly British, French and Indian troops along with the Australians and New Zealanders.<ref>{{harvnb|Grey|2008|pp=93\u201394}}.</ref>\n\n====Gallipoli====\nDuring the [[Landing at Anzac Cove]] on 25 April 1915, the 2nd Battalion, under Braund's command, came ashore in the second and third waves,<ref name=AWM/> landing a total of 31 officers and 937 other ranks.<ref>{{harvnb|Bean|1941a|p=281}}.</ref> Upon landing, the 2nd Battalion dispatched two companies, 'A' and 'D' to assist the 3rd Brigade who were  pushing inland towards a high feature known as \"Baby 700\", which overlooked the beachhead.<ref>{{harvnb|Bean|1941a|pp=294, 296 & 299}}.</ref> One of the 2nd Battalion's platoons, under Lieutenant [[Leslie Morshead]], advanced further than any other Australian unit, making it to the slopes of Baby 700, before a determined counter-attack by Ottoman forces drove them back in the afternoon.<ref>{{harvnb|Bean|1941a|pp=309\u2013316}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Captured Turkish trench Lone Pine 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|Members of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions in a captured trench at Lone Pine, August 1915|alt=Soldiers sitting and standing in a trench covered by logs]]\n\nMeanwhile, the battalion's other two companies, 'B' and 'C', had been held back in reserve. In the early afternoon, Braund led them up the steep terrain under fire to the vital junction between two positions known as \"Walker's Ridge\" and \"Russell's Top\".

It stars [[Gary Busey]], [[Jodie Foster]], and [[Robbie Robertson]]. It also includes an early role for [[Fred Ward]].\n\n==Plot==\nFrankie ([[Gary Busey]]) and Patch ([[Robbie Robertson]]) are friends who work for the Great American Carnival,  a small-time carnival that tours the South. Frankie does an act as The Mighty Bozo, a character who sits in a [[dunk tank]] insulting the crowd, while Patch takes the money, points out the next mark to milk of his money to the Bozo, and distributes the balls outside. Patch is also the show's \"adjuster,\" hence his carny name, working with the owner of the carnival, Heavy St. John ([[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]]) negotiating deals with local officials and representatives of the local underworld to keep the show open.\n\nWhat it takes to keep the show open varies from town to town. In one town, it's making good on a city official's losses gambling on the midway and giving a city councilor a pile of free passes to the carnival. In another, it's compromising to allow the strippers to work,  but keeping the freak show closed. In a third, it involves providing an underworld boss's thug with a girl he fancies. He also works to maintain harmony among the carnies. Patch is good at his job of patching together the deals that keep the carnival rolling and keeping the peace on the lot, but never likes being played for a fool.\n\nAt one stand Donna ([[Jodie Foster]]), an independent 18-year-old bored with small town life, strikes up a friendship with Frankie and at his invitation follows the carny onto the carnival circuit. Patch is less than happy with her presence, and would like her out of the picture. To get Patch off her back, she takes a job with the cooch show as a \"side girl,\" a backup dancer who does not actually take her clothes off. Patch plants the suggestion with Delno, the carny who runs the girlie show, that Donna wants to \"work strong\"\u2014be a stripper, in other words. When she is thrust onstage, she freezes and a brawl ensues. Afterwards, she covers with Heavy to keep Patch out of it, taking the blame for Patch's setting her up to fail herself.\n\nFrankie gets her a job in the string joint, one of the midway games of chance, under the tutelage of Gerta ([[Meg Foster]]). Coached in how the game works, Donna is a big success, learning how to con the marks and get their money without giving herself to them (which is what the rubes really want). After one successful scamming, she winds up in bed with Patch and the two of them are caught [[in flagrante]] by Frankie, which puts a strain on his relationships with Patch and with Donna.\n\nWhile this is going on, a con run by Nails ([[Theodore Wilson]]) on Skeets, the local crime boss's main enforcer, goes badly wrong. Upset at losing their money, the local underworld's muscle boys wreck the Bozo Joint and kill On-Your-Mark ([[Elisha Cook]]), a carny who has been \"with it\" for more than fifty years and was planning to retire at the end of the season. Crime boss Marvin Dill ([[Bill McKinney]]) comes after the carnival intending to extort more money than they have already paid him. However, the carnies have had enough of his shaking them down. To avenge On-Your-Mark's death and get Dill off their backs, Patch, Frankie, Donna and Heavy run a scam on Mr. Dill involving the apparent beheading of Skeets. (They don't actually kill him, of course, but the effect used to terrify Dill and make him believe they ''did'' is simple and horrifyingly effective.)\n\nThe movie ends with the Great American Carnival continuing on its way, with Donna her own woman rather than Frankie's girlfriend, Frankie and the Patch reconciled, and the implication that in a season or two Heavy will retire and Patch will be the one running the show.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gary Busey]] as Frankie\n*[[Jodie Foster]] as Donna\n*[[Robbie Robertson]] as Patch\n*[[Meg Foster]] as Gerta\n*[[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]] as Heavy St. John\n*[[Elisha Cook, Jr.]] as On-Your-Mark\n*[[Tim Thomerson]] as Doubles\n*[[Theodore Wilson]] as Nails (as Teddy Wilson)\n*[[John Lehne}} as Skeet\n*[[Bill McKinney]] as Marvin Dill\n*[[Bert Remsen]] as Delno Baptiste\n*[[Woodrow Parfrey]] as W.

'Carny' does.\"<ref>[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (July 18, 1980). \"'Carny' an appealing bit of gritty Americana\". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 4, p. 1, 3.</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film had \"nice performances\" but was \"not cohesive as it might be,\" because the filmmakers \"appear to be unable to resist the colorful or bizarre material that leads nowhere.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |date=June 13, 1980 |title=Screen: Jodie Foster in 'Carny' |url= |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=C8 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' declared, \"An excitingly eccentric, nervously energetic work, 'Carny' is an intriguing look at an infrequently examined American subculture which emerges as more impressive in its various, sometimes brilliant parts than as a satisfying whole.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=May 21, 1980 |title=Carny |url= |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=20 }}</ref> [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the \"excellence of the acting\" but thought the film ended \"in a quite unsatisfactory way that leaves virtually nothing resolved and everyone compromised.\"<ref>[[Charles Chaplin|Champlin, Charles]] (September 7, 1980). \"An Ex-Hawk Sinks Claws Into 'Carny'\". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Calendar, p. 27.</ref> Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, \"The material never does achieve dramatic coordination or resolution. Nevertheless, in a generous mood the seamy show-biz atmosphere may appear novel and compelling enough to justify patience with the shapeless, unfinished story.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Arnold |first=Gary |date=November 14, 1980 |title=Sinister Sideshow |url= |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |page=D4 }}</ref>\n\nReviewing the film 30 years later, Dennis Swartz said, \"The ambiance turns out to be much richer than the narrative, in this still intriguing misanthropic pic (freaks and outsiders against the ugly conventional world) that revels in the pleasure one gets in hustling someone at their con game.\" \n<ref>http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/carny.htm</ref>\n\nFrederic and Mary Ann Brussat said of the movie in 2013, \"''Carny'' is a tightly structured, atmospherically rich little movie. Alex North's excellent music capitalizes on the exotic elements in the storyline.

It stars [[Gary Busey]], [[Jodie Foster]], and [[Robbie Robertson]]. It also includes an early role for [[Fred Ward]].\n\n==Plot==\nFrankie ([[Gary Busey]]) and Patch ([[Robbie Robertson]]) are friends who work for the Great American Carnival,  a small-time carnival that tours the South. Frankie does an act as The Mighty Bozo, a character who sits in a [[dunk tank]] insulting the crowd, while Patch takes the money, points out the next mark to milk of his money to the Bozo, and distributes the balls outside. Patch is also the show's \"adjuster,\" hence his carny name, working with the owner of the carnival, Heavy St. John ([[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]]) negotiating deals with local officials and representatives of the local underworld to keep the show open.\n\nWhat it takes to keep the show open varies from town to town. In one town, it's making good on a city official's losses gambling on the midway and giving a city councilor a pile of free passes to the carnival. In another, it's compromising to allow the strippers to work,  but keeping the freak show closed. In a third, it involves providing an underworld boss's thug with a girl he fancies. He also works to maintain harmony among the carnies. Patch is good at his job of patching together the deals that keep the carnival rolling and keeping the peace on the lot, but never likes being played for a fool.\n\nAt one stand Donna ([[Jodie Foster]]), an independent 18-year-old bored with small town life, strikes up a friendship with Frankie and at his invitation follows the carny onto the carnival circuit. Patch is less than happy with her presence, and would like her out of the picture. To get Patch off her back, she takes a job with the cooch show as a \"side girl,\" a backup dancer who does not actually take her clothes off. Patch plants the suggestion with Delno, the carny who runs the girlie show, that Donna wants to \"work strong\"\u2014be a stripper, in other words. When she is thrust onstage, she freezes and a brawl ensues. Afterwards, she covers with Heavy to keep Patch out of it, taking the blame for Patch's setting her up to fail herself.\n\nFrankie gets her a job in the string joint, one of the midway games of chance, under the tutelage of Gerta ([[Meg Foster]]). Coached in how the game works, Donna is a big success, learning how to con the marks and get their money without giving herself to them (which is what the rubes really want). After one successful scamming, she winds up in bed with Patch and the two of them are caught [[in flagrante]] by Frankie, which puts a strain on his relationships with Patch and with Donna.\n\nWhile this is going on, a con run by Nails ([[Theodore Wilson]]) on Skeets, the local crime boss's main enforcer, goes badly wrong. Upset at losing their money, the local underworld's muscle boys wreck the Bozo Joint and kill On-Your-Mark ([[Elisha Cook]]), a carny who has been \"with it\" for more than fifty years and was planning to retire at the end of the season. Crime boss Marvin Dill ([[Bill McKinney]]) comes after the carnival intending to extort more money than they have already paid him. However, the carnies have had enough of his shaking them down. To avenge On-Your-Mark's death and get Dill off their backs, Patch, Frankie, Donna and Heavy run a scam on Mr. Dill involving the apparent beheading of Skeets. (They don't actually kill him, of course, but the effect used to terrify Dill and make him believe they ''did'' is simple and horrifyingly effective.)\n\nThe movie ends with the Great American Carnival continuing on its way, with Donna her own woman rather than Frankie's girlfriend, Frankie and the Patch reconciled, and the implication that in a season or two Heavy will retire and Patch will be the one running the show.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gary Busey]] as Frankie\n*[[Jodie Foster]] as Donna\n*[[Robbie Robertson]] as Patch\n*[[Meg Foster]] as Gerta\n*[[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]] as Heavy St. John\n*[[Elisha Cook, Jr.]] as On-Your-Mark\n*[[Tim Thomerson]] as Doubles\n*[[Theodore Wilson]] as Nails (as Teddy Wilson)\n*[[John Lehne}} as Skeet\n*[[Bill McKinney]] as Marvin Dill\n*[[Bert Remsen]] as Delno Baptiste\n*[[Woodrow Parfrey]] as W.

Also, Bliss had supplanted Garfield's physician [[Jedediah Hyde Baxter]]. Bliss and the other doctors who attended Garfield had guessed wrong about the path of the bullet in his body; they had probed rightward into his back instead of leftward, missing the location of the bullet but creating a new channel which filled with pus. The autopsy discovered this error and revealed pneumonia in both lungs and a body that was filled with pus due to uncontrolled [[sepsis]].<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|pp=312\u2013313}}</ref> The conventional narrative in regards to James A. Garfield's post-shooting medical condition was challenged by Theodore Pappas and Shahrzad Joharifard in a 2013 article of theirs in the [[American Journal of Surgery]], where they argued that Garfield died from a late rupture of a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm (that initially developed shortly after Guiteau's shooting of Garfield, thus preventing Garfield from bleeding to death immediately after he was shot by Guiteau but instead allowing him to live for an additional 80 days) and that the symptoms that Garfield suffered in the last couple of months of his life were actually caused by acute [[cholecystitis]], a condition that these authors speculate (based on Garfield's [[autopsy]] report) that Garfield developed as a result of his doctors accidentally puncturing his [[bladder]] in July 1881, specifically three or four weeks after he was shot by Guiteau\u2014thus causing the decline in Garfield's condition that was visible starting from July 23, 1881.<ref>[https://www.americanjournalofsurgery.com/article/S0002-9610(13)00297-3/abstract]</ref>\n\nChester Arthur was at his home in New York City when word came the night of September 19 that Garfield had died. He said, \"I hope\u2014my God, I do hope it is a mistake\", but confirmation by telegram came soon after. Arthur was [[Inauguration of Chester A. Arthur|inaugurated]] early in the morning on September 20, and he took the presidential oath of office from [[John R. Brady]], a New York Supreme Court judge. Arthur then left for Long Branch to pay his respects to Mrs. Garfield before going on to Washington.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=608}}</ref>\n\nGarfield's body was taken to Washington, where it lay in state for two days in the [[Capitol Rotunda]] before being taken to [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], where the funeral was held on September 26.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|pp=608\u2013609}}</ref>\n\n== Trial and execution ==\nGuiteau went on trial in November,<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|p=321}}</ref> represented by his brother-in-law George Scolville. He received ample media attention during his trial for his bizarre behavior, including constantly insulting his defense team, formatting his testimony in epic poems which he recited at length, and soliciting legal advice from random spectators in the audience via passed notes. He claimed that he was not guilty because Garfield's murder was the will of God and he was only an instrument of it.<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=173}}</ref> He sang \"[[John Brown's Body]]\" to the court.<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=136}}</ref> He dictated an autobiography to the ''[[New York Herald]]'', ending it with a personal ad for a nice Christian lady under 30.<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|p=250}}</ref> He was oblivious to the American public's outrage and hatred of him, even after he was almost killed twice himself\u2014once while in prison, and again while being transported there. At one point, he argued that Garfield was killed not by him but by medical malpractice: \"I deny the killing, if your honor please. We admit the shooting.\"<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|p=322}}</ref> He was housed at [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]] in the southeastern quadrant of Washington, D.C. throughout the trial and up until his execution.\n\n[[File:SheetMusicCoverPrezGarfieldsFuneralMarch1881.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Funeral music written in Garfield's honor]]\nGuiteau's trial was one of the first high-profile cases in the United States where the insanity defense was considered.<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=175}}</ref> Guiteau vehemently insisted that he had been legally insane at the time of the shooting, but he was not really medically insane, which caused a major rift with his defense lawyers, and which probably contributed to the jury's impression that Guiteau was merely trying to deny responsibility.\n\n[[File:MourningRibbonUSPresidentJamesAGarfieldDeath1881.jpg|thumb|upright|Silk mourning ribbon]]\nGuiteau was actively making plans to start a lecture tour after his release and to run for president himself in 1884; at the same time, he delighted in the media circus surrounding his trial. He was dismayed when the jury was unconvinced of his divine inspiration, convicting him of the murder. He was found guilty on January 25, 1882.<ref>\"Guiteau Found Guilty,\" New York Times. January 26, 1882, p. 1</ref> He appealed, but his appeal was rejected, and he was hanged on June 30, 1882, in the District of Columbia. Guiteau famously danced his way up to the gallows and waved at the audience from the gallows, shook hands with his executioner and, as a last request, recited a poem that he had written called \"[[I am Going to the Lordy]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/guiteau/guiteaulastwords.html |title=Last Words of Assassin Charles Guiteau |accessdate=2007-12-15 |publisher=[[University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City]] School of Law |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213183522/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/guiteau/guiteaulastwords.html |archivedate=13 December 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He requested an orchestra to play as he sang the poem; it was denied.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Garfield Monument1.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The Garfield Monument at the U.S. Capitol]]\n[[File:Garfield Assassination Site (4225800751).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Memorial to President Garfield in the former train station.

Garfield himself had called for civil service reform in his inaugural address<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=540}}</ref> and supported it as president in the belief that it would make government more efficient.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|pp=551\u2013553}}</ref> It was passed as something of a memorial to the fallen President.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=610}}</ref> Arthur lost the Republican Party nomination in 1884 to Blaine, who went on to lose a [[1884 United States presidential election|close election]] to Democrat [[Grover Cleveland]].\n\nThe Sixth Street rail station was later demolished. The site is now occupied by the West Building of the [[National Gallery of Art]]. No plaque or memorial marks the spot where Garfield was shot,<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=159}}</ref> but a few blocks away, a Garfield memorial statue stands on the southwest corner of the Capitol grounds.\n\nThe question of Presidential disability was not addressed. [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Vacancy and disability|Article II, section 1, clause 6]] of the Constitution says that in case of the \"Inability [of the President] to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President\", but gives no further instruction on what constitutes inability or how the President's inability should be determined. Garfield had lain on his sickbed for 80 days without performing any of the duties of his office except for the signing of an extradition paper, but this did not prove to be a difficulty because in the 19th century the federal government effectively shut down for the summer regardless. During Garfield's ordeal, the Congress was not in session and there was little for a president to do. Blaine suggested the Cabinet declare Arthur acting president, but this option was rejected by all, including Arthur, who did not wish to be perceived as grasping for power.<ref name=\"Peskin 604\" /><ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=171}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Garfield Tea House.jpg|thumb|The Garfield Tea House in October 2007]]\nCongress did not deal with the problem of what to do if a President were alive but incapacitated as Garfield was, nor did the Congress take up the question 38 years later, when [[Woodrow Wilson]] suffered a [[stroke]] that put him in a [[coma]] for days and left him partially paralyzed and blind in one eye for the last year and a half of his presidency. It was not until the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] was ratified in 1967 that there was an official procedure for what to do if the president became incapacitated.\n\nLincoln's assassination had taken place roughly 16 years before in the closing stages of the Civil War. On the other hand, Garfield's term was marked (for the most part) by peacetime, and a general complacency with respect to presidential security had developed by this time. Garfield, like many other presidents, often preferred to interact directly with the public, and although some form of security was almost certainly in place, a comprehensive security detail had not been seriously considered by either Congress or the president up to that point. Remarkably, it would not be until the [[assassination of William McKinley]] some twenty years later that Congress would finally task the [[United States Secret Service]] (founded to prevent counterfeiting) with the responsibility of ensuring the president's personal safety.<ref>{{cite book | author = President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Guiteau]] at the [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and died in [[Elberon, New Jersey]]. Guiteau's motive was revenge against Garfield for an imagined political debt.\n\n== Assassination ==\n\n=== Background === \n[[File:CharlesJGuiteau.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Charles J. Guiteau, President James A.

Also, Bliss had supplanted Garfield's physician [[Jedediah Hyde Baxter]]. Bliss and the other doctors who attended Garfield had guessed wrong about the path of the bullet in his body; they had probed rightward into his back instead of leftward, missing the location of the bullet but creating a new channel which filled with pus. The autopsy discovered this error and revealed pneumonia in both lungs and a body that was filled with pus due to uncontrolled [[sepsis]].<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|pp=312\u2013313}}</ref> The conventional narrative in regards to James A. Garfield's post-shooting medical condition was challenged by Theodore Pappas and Shahrzad Joharifard in a 2013 article of theirs in the [[American Journal of Surgery]], where they argued that Garfield died from a late rupture of a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm (that initially developed shortly after Guiteau's shooting of Garfield, thus preventing Garfield from bleeding to death immediately after he was shot by Guiteau but instead allowing him to live for an additional 80 days) and that the symptoms that Garfield suffered in the last couple of months of his life were actually caused by acute [[cholecystitis]], a condition that these authors speculate (based on Garfield's [[autopsy]] report) that Garfield developed as a result of his doctors accidentally puncturing his [[bladder]] in July 1881, specifically three or four weeks after he was shot by Guiteau\u2014thus causing the decline in Garfield's condition that was visible starting from July 23, 1881.<ref>[https://www.americanjournalofsurgery.com/article/S0002-9610(13)00297-3/abstract]</ref>\n\nChester Arthur was at his home in New York City when word came the night of September 19 that Garfield had died. He said, \"I hope\u2014my God, I do hope it is a mistake\", but confirmation by telegram came soon after. Arthur was [[Inauguration of Chester A. Arthur|inaugurated]] early in the morning on September 20, and he took the presidential oath of office from [[John R. Brady]], a New York Supreme Court judge. Arthur then left for Long Branch to pay his respects to Mrs. Garfield before going on to Washington.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=608}}</ref>\n\nGarfield's body was taken to Washington, where it lay in state for two days in the [[Capitol Rotunda]] before being taken to [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], where the funeral was held on September 26.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|pp=608\u2013609}}</ref>\n\n== Trial and execution ==\nGuiteau went on trial in November,<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|p=321}}</ref> represented by his brother-in-law George Scolville. He received ample media attention during his trial for his bizarre behavior, including constantly insulting his defense team, formatting his testimony in epic poems which he recited at length, and soliciting legal advice from random spectators in the audience via passed notes. He claimed that he was not guilty because Garfield's murder was the will of God and he was only an instrument of it.<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=173}}</ref> He sang \"[[John Brown's Body]]\" to the court.<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=136}}</ref> He dictated an autobiography to the ''[[New York Herald]]'', ending it with a personal ad for a nice Christian lady under 30.<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|p=250}}</ref> He was oblivious to the American public's outrage and hatred of him, even after he was almost killed twice himself\u2014once while in prison, and again while being transported there. At one point, he argued that Garfield was killed not by him but by medical malpractice: \"I deny the killing, if your honor please. We admit the shooting.\"<ref>{{harvp|Millard|2011|p=322}}</ref> He was housed at [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]] in the southeastern quadrant of Washington, D.C. throughout the trial and up until his execution.\n\n[[File:SheetMusicCoverPrezGarfieldsFuneralMarch1881.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Funeral music written in Garfield's honor]]\nGuiteau's trial was one of the first high-profile cases in the United States where the insanity defense was considered.<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=175}}</ref> Guiteau vehemently insisted that he had been legally insane at the time of the shooting, but he was not really medically insane, which caused a major rift with his defense lawyers, and which probably contributed to the jury's impression that Guiteau was merely trying to deny responsibility.\n\n[[File:MourningRibbonUSPresidentJamesAGarfieldDeath1881.jpg|thumb|upright|Silk mourning ribbon]]\nGuiteau was actively making plans to start a lecture tour after his release and to run for president himself in 1884; at the same time, he delighted in the media circus surrounding his trial.

C1.</ref> at the Army's [[Forest Glen Annex]] in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]].\nGarfield's assassination was instrumental to the passage of the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] on January 16, 1883. Garfield himself had called for civil service reform in his inaugural address<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=540}}</ref> and supported it as president in the belief that it would make government more efficient.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|pp=551\u2013553}}</ref> It was passed as something of a memorial to the fallen President.<ref>{{harvp|Peskin|1978|p=610}}</ref> Arthur lost the Republican Party nomination in 1884 to Blaine, who went on to lose a [[1884 United States presidential election|close election]] to Democrat [[Grover Cleveland]].\n\nThe Sixth Street rail station was later demolished. The site is now occupied by the West Building of the [[National Gallery of Art]]. No plaque or memorial marks the spot where Garfield was shot,<ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=159}}</ref> but a few blocks away, a Garfield memorial statue stands on the southwest corner of the Capitol grounds.\n\nThe question of Presidential disability was not addressed. [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Vacancy and disability|Article II, section 1, clause 6]] of the Constitution says that in case of the \"Inability [of the President] to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President\", but gives no further instruction on what constitutes inability or how the President's inability should be determined. Garfield had lain on his sickbed for 80 days without performing any of the duties of his office except for the signing of an extradition paper, but this did not prove to be a difficulty because in the 19th century the federal government effectively shut down for the summer regardless. During Garfield's ordeal, the Congress was not in session and there was little for a president to do. Blaine suggested the Cabinet declare Arthur acting president, but this option was rejected by all, including Arthur, who did not wish to be perceived as grasping for power.<ref name=\"Peskin 604\" /><ref>{{harvp|Vowell|2005|p=171}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Garfield Tea House.jpg|thumb|The Garfield Tea House in October 2007]]\nCongress did not deal with the problem of what to do if a President were alive but incapacitated as Garfield was, nor did the Congress take up the question 38 years later, when [[Woodrow Wilson]] suffered a [[stroke]] that put him in a [[coma]] for days and left him partially paralyzed and blind in one eye for the last year and a half of his presidency. It was not until the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] was ratified in 1967 that there was an official procedure for what to do if the president became incapacitated.\n\nLincoln's assassination had taken place roughly 16 years before in the closing stages of the Civil War. On the other hand, Garfield's term was marked (for the most part) by peacetime, and a general complacency with respect to presidential security had developed by this time. Garfield, like many other presidents, often preferred to interact directly with the public, and although some form of security was almost certainly in place, a comprehensive security detail had not been seriously considered by either Congress or the president up to that point. Remarkably, it would not be until the [[assassination of William McKinley]] some twenty years later that Congress would finally task the [[United States Secret Service]] (founded to prevent counterfeiting) with the responsibility of ensuring the president's personal safety.<ref>{{cite book | author = President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.
