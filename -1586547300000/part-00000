His most important original contribution to the Muslim literature is his book ''[[Asrar-i Shari'at]]'' (''The secrets of the Muslim creed'').\n\n==Early life==\nChangawi was a native of [[Changa Bangial]] in [[Rawalpindi]] district ([[Pakistan]]). He was a scion of a respectable Rajput petty landowner family with no particular academic traditions. His preceptor and religious guide was his maternal uncle [[Maulavi Muhammad Umar Bakhsh]] (died 1887), a naqshbandi-mujaddadi Sufi of repute and an author of numerous books on religious subjects, under whose guidance Changawi completed the traditional course of [[Dars- i Nizami]]. By the age of 17 he had a fair knowledge of the religious sciences and a good command of Arabic, Persian and Urdu. His desire to acquire also modern education was fulfilled when he was admitted in 1885, at a rather late age, to the Mission School in Rawalpindi. He completed his academic courses within the short span of three years acquiring thereby good working knowledge of the English language. He later published numerous treatises in English. It was during this period that he was exposed to the natural sciences as well as confronted with the Christian mission.\n\nAfter leaving school he took the job of a private preceptor with the former royal family of Afghanistan, parts of which were residing in Rawalpindi. He was in intimate contact with the Sufi circles of the town and in fact took the oath of allegiance (bai'a) at the hand of [[Khwaja Faqir Muhammad Tirahi]], who happened to make a stop over in Rawalpindi shortly before or in 1887.\n\n==Education==\nOn the one hand he compiled the [[Ahmadiyya]] [[Fiqh]] already during the life-time of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], whose pronouncements ([[Fatwa]]s) pertaining to the rituals and later on also those of his successors were compiled by him initially in [[Fatawa Ahmadiyya]] in two volumes. This compendium was later on expanded into many-volume book on the same subject. Changawi also pursued his studies of Sufi literature, the culmination of which was his translation of the [[Futuhat Makkiya]] by Ibn Arabi. Unfortunately only two volumes could be published. Lately, in 1999 a new edition of this work has appeared in one volume from Lahore. (Futuhat Makkiya. Tarjuma wa tashri': Maulavi Muhammad Fazal Khan. Lahore: Tasawwuf Foundation. 1999). The second part of his translation of [[Futuhat Makkiyya]] has come out in 2013. In fact Changawi had announced that he had compiled and translated another book about the experiences of Ibn Arabi, which was to be published under the title of Mushahadat-i Ibn Arabi. But the book does not seem to have been printed.\n\n==Asrar-i Shari'at==\nChangawis major work [[Asrar-i Shari'at]], which kept him busy for over two decades, was published in or just after 1909.\nThe first volume was also published in Arabic in 1923 on the lower part of [[Nahj al-Musalli]], another book of the author which comprises on the Fiqh of the Ahmadiyya concerning the prayers (salat).\n\n===Volume I===\nThe first volume of Asrar-i Shari'at comprises on three parts: 1) kitab al-tahara (The book of ritual washings), 2) kitab al-salat (The book of prayers), 3) kitab al-zakat (The book of Zakat). In each case important aspects of the respective subject matters are discussed with reference to the wisdom of the specific rulings. For example, in the case of wudu (ritual washings) the prevalent sequence of washing (face, hands, head and feet) is defended \"being the most natural\", as the author puts it. The eyes behold and inform the heart, which in its turn alarms the brain, where the deliberation takes place. The face has a kind of natural preference over other parts of the body. The feelings are expressed by the face and then comes the turn of the hands to carry out the orders of the brain. The washing of the feet in the end is not to belittle their importance.\n\nThe author very often refers to medical findings as well as to general human experience. Why, for example, a cloth should be washed thoroughly if it is wetted by the urine of a girl, but may be cleaned locally, when wetted by the urine of a boy? The reason, he thinks, lies in the difference of the composition of urine of the male and the female infants. Why women have been ordained to substitute the fast of Ramadan, if it falls during their menstruation period, but the substitution of the daily prayers has been waived? The reason, he states, is that the Ramadan commences only once in a year and moreover the substitution of a limited number of fasts does not constitute any particular burden. The prayers are performed daily and may therefore be foregone. Why the mourning period has been limited for women to three days in the case of the death of their parents, but has been extended to four months and ten days in the case of their spouses? As a general rule, said the author, Islam abhors the observation of extended mourning periods. But in the case of the death of a husband, it is important to wait for the prescribed period to ascertain, whether or not the woman was pregnant of her deceased spouse. Only after this period she may remarry.\n\nThese and a host of other questions \u2013 some times they are pertinent and at times of marginal value \u2013 are raised in the book. The answers are at times convincing, even according to our today's standards. But occasionally the reader is left wondering about the logic of the argument. In the chapter of azan (call for prayer) the author discusses the reason for calling azan in one ear and iqama in the other of the newly born baby. After recounting three reasons: a) the first voice leaves a permanent impression on the mind of the infant; b) the call for prayer belongs to the distinctive features of Islam, therefore the child of a Muslim must be acquainted with it right from birth; c) Satan has a horror of the azan and along with him also the Jinnis ran away, he surprisingly also mentions that the infant is immunised through azan against infant mortality. Unconvincing is likewise his discussion about zakat (wealth tax) on camels, which is levied on five camels, whereas any number of horses, asses and mules are exempted from it. He argues that they are devilish animals and the act of paying zakat purifies them. Horses and other beasts of burden are used for jihad (war) and are dedicated to the cause of God. Therefore, they are exempted from zakat.\n\n===Volume II===\nThe second volume of [[Asrar-i Shari\u2019at]] consists on: a) kitab al-saum (The book of fasting), b) kitab al-hajj (The book of pilgrimage), c) kitab al-nikah (The book of matrimony), d) kitab al-riqq (The book of slavery), e) kitab al-buyu\u2019 (The book of trading), f) kitab at-akl wa'l-shurb (The book of eating and drinking), g) kitab al-janayat wa'1-hudud (The book of personal code), h) kitab al-fara\u2019id (The book of inheritance), i) and kitab falsfat al-Islam (The book of the philosophy of Islam).\n\nIn this volume there is one interesting [[ijtihad]] of the author, to which special attention must be drawn. It is about dispensation from fasting for people living on the north and south poles, where the days and nights extend up to six months. The author notes that the Muslims have been ordained to observe the fasting month, when they are witness to the month of Ramadan. On the poles the situation is abnormal, as the year is divided into a day and a night, both extending to six months each. In such a case a Muslim can neither observe the five daily prayers, as they are tied to different stages of the sun in a day, nor can there be any fasting, which also needs shorter division of days and nights, as well as the division of the year into months. Where there is no month of Ramadan, there can be no fasting either. This argumentation in a bit strange in the presence of time measuring devices, such as watches, which are being very well used on both poles for everyday life. Also months are counted there in the same manner as anywhere else in the world.\n\n===Volume III===\nThe third volume is entirely devoted to dogmatic theology. Therefore, this volume is methodologically completely different. In this part, for example, questions pertaining to revelation are discussed and whether God still addresses human beings. After giving a long discourse about divine revelation, the author concludes that God still blesses human beings with divine revelations (ilham, wahi). Inevitably the next question was, whether the prophethood had come to an end with Muhammad, whom the Qur'an had addressed as the last of the prophets (khatam al-nabiyyin). The author thinks that Islam was the culmination of divine law and Muhammad was the last law-giving prophet, after whom there was no place for a new prophet and a new divine law.\n\nBeing a follower of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who had claimed a minor prophethood ([[zilli nabi]]) for himself, Changawi adopted an interesting device of introducing the claims and explanations of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad regarding his position in this and other matters by quoting him verbatim. Also the arguments of his adversaries were given adequate attention and were quoted extensively to present their respective view-points. In this way disputed subject-matters between the Ahmadiyya and their adversaries were discussed without showing bias to one or the other side. For example, questions pertaining to the life and death of Jesus Christ and his advent along with the Mahdi and whether they will be two distinct persons or, as Mirza Ghulam Ahmad had claimed, a single person was duly discussed.\n\nThen he goes on to discuss the nature of the angels and whether it was God's design to misguide humanity by creating Satan. Very interesting are his discourses about the nature of the Jinnis and the mystery of Dajjal. The author is perhaps at his best when he ventures to answer questions pertaining to death, the bridge sirat, which everybody must cross to reach his/her ultimate destination, heaven or hell. And finally the day of judgement is devoted a lengthy discourse.\n\nOn the whole the [[Asrar-i Shari'at]] is an interesting book both theologically as well as historically. Its theological importance lies in its bold attempt to interpret Islamic teachings from rationalistic view-point in a period of the Muslim history, when Islam seemed to be on the defensive every where in the world.\n\n==Other works==\nChangawi's other books include a treatise about Islam's response to Christian missions ([[A'ina-i 'isai'yat]]) and a book about Islamic teachings regarding matrimonial relations between husband and wife ([[Hadayat al-Zaujain]]). The last mentioned book could not be published during the life-time of the author, who had finished the manuscript, but was perhaps too busy during his later years with pamphleteering.\n\nIn fact shortly before his death in 1938 Changawi left the Ahmadiyya after an association of almost 40 years. He had to pay for his convictions dearly which affected his reputation as a scholar.\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.mediafire.com/file/dnxg7scvfewxqn2/Fazl11.pdf\n* Muniruddin Ahmed: Maulavi Muhammad Fazal Khan \u2013 aik aalam-e rabbani ki sawaanih hayat. 2000; 2nd.

One of the animals found here is the [[polar bear]], which is on the [[coat of arms]] of the Danish royal family in Greenland]] The '''history of Greenland''' is a history of life under extreme [[Arctic]] conditions: currently, an [[ice cap]] covers about 80 percent of the island, restricting human activity largely to the coasts.\n\nThe first humans are thought to have arrived in [[Greenland]] around 2500 BC. Their descendants apparently died out and were succeeded by several other groups migrating from continental [[North America]]. There has been no evidence discovered that Greenland was known to Europeans until the 10th century, when [[Iceland]]ic [[Viking]]s settled on its southwestern coast, which seems to have been uninhabited when they arrived. The ancestors of the [[Inuit]] Greenlanders who live there today appear to have migrated there later, around AD 1200, from northwestern Greenland.  While the Inuit survived in the icy world of the [[Little Ice Age]], the early [[Eastern Settlement|Norse settlements]] along the southwestern coast disappeared, leaving the Inuit as the only inhabitants of the island for several centuries. During this time, [[Denmark-Norway]], apparently believing the Norse settlements had survived, continued to claim sovereignty over the island despite the lack of any contact between the Norse Greenlanders and their Scandinavian brethren. In 1721, aspiring to become a [[Danish colonial empire|colonial power]], Denmark-Norway sent a missionary expedition to Greenland with the stated aim of reinstating Christianity among descendants of the Norse Greenlanders who may have reverted to [[Norse mythology|paganism]]. When the missionaries found no descendants of the Norse Greenlanders, they baptized the Inuit Greenlanders they found living there instead. Denmark-Norway then developed trading colonies along the coast and imposed a trade monopoly and other colonial privileges on the area.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], when Germany invaded Denmark, Greenlanders became socially and economically less connected to Denmark and more connected to the [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/1944-12-27_Yanks_Clear_Greenland_of_Nazis |title=Yanks Clear Greenland of Nazis,1944/12/27 (1944) |author= |date= |website= |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref> After the war, Denmark resumed control of Greenland and in 1953, converted its status from colony to overseas ''[[Amt (subnational entity)|amt]]'' (county).

Because of Greenland's remoteness and climate, survival there was difficult. Over the course of centuries, one culture succeeded another as groups died out and were replaced by new immigrants.

During the 980s, explorers led by [[Erik the Red]] set out from [[Iceland]] and reached the southwest coast of Greenland, found the region uninhabited, and subsequently settled there.

He sailed to Greenland, where he explored the coastline and claimed certain regions as his own. He then returned to Iceland to persuade people to join him in establishing a settlement on Greenland. The Icelandic sagas say that 25 ships left Iceland with Erik the Red in 985, and that only 14 of them arrived safely in Greenland.<ref name=\"The Fate of Greenland's Vikings\">[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/greenland/ The Fate of Greenland's Vikings]</ref> This date has been approximately confirmed by radiocarbon dating of remains at the first settlement at [[Brattahl\u00ed\u00f0|Brattahlid]] (now [[Qassiarsuk]]), which yielded a date of about 1000. According to the sagas, it was also in the year 1000 that Erik's son, [[Leif Eirikson]], left the settlement to explore the regions around [[Vinland]], which historians generally assume to have been located in what is now [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].\n\nThe Norse established settlements along Greenland's fjords. It is possible, that the fjords at that time were surrounded by forests of 4- to 6-metre tall birch trees and by hills covered with grass and willow brush as the [[Qinngua Valley]] currently is, but this hasn't been determined yet. <ref>{{cite web | url = https://ign.ku.dk/english/about/arboreta/arboretum-greenland/forest-plantations/ |title=The Forest Plantations in The Greenlandic Arboretum |}}</ref> If the presumption is true then the Norse probably cleared the landscape by felling trees to use as building material and fuel, and by allowing their sheep and goats to graze there in both summer and winter. The occuring soil erosion could have been an important factor in the demise of the colonies, as the land was stripped of its natural cover.\n \nThe Norse settled in three separate locations in south-western Greenland: the larger [[Eastern Settlement]], the smaller [[Western Settlement]], and the still smaller [[Ivittuut|Middle Settlement]] (often considered part of the Eastern one). Estimates put the combined population of the settlements at their height between 2,000 and 10,000, with more recent estimates<ref>N. Lynnerup, in {{harvnb|Fitzhugh|Ward|2000}}</ref> trending toward the lower figure. Archeologists have identified the ruins of approximately 620 farms: 500 in the Eastern Settlement, 95 in the Western Settlement, and 20 in the Middle.\n\n[[File:I. E. C. Rasmussen - Sommernat under den Gr\u00f8nlandske Kyst circa Aar 1000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Summer on the Greenland coast {{circa|1000}}]]\nThe economy of the Norse Greenlanders depended on a combination of pastoral farming with hunting and some fishing. Farmers kept cattle, sheep and goats - shipped into the island - for their milk, cheese and butter, while most of the consumed meat came from hunted caribou and seals. Both individual farmers and groups of farmers organised summer trips to the more northerly [[Disko Bay]] area where they hunted walruses, narwhals and polar bears for their skins, hides and ivory. Besides being used to make garments and shoes, these resources also functioned as a form of currency, as well as making up the most important export commodities.<ref>[https://www.ancient.eu/article/1208/viking-age-greenland/ Viking Age Greenland] ''Ancient History Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nThe settlements carried on a trade in [[ivory trade|ivory]] from [[walrus]] [[tusk]]s with Europe, as well as exporting rope, sheep, seals, wool and cattle hides (according to one 13th-century account). They depended on Iceland and Norway for iron tools, wood (especially for boat building, although they may also have obtained wood from coastal [[Labrador]] - ''[[Markland]]''), supplemental foodstuffs, and religious and social contacts. Trade ships from Iceland and Norway traveled to Greenland every year and would sometimes overwinter in Greenland. Beginning in the late-13th century, laws required all ships from Greenland to sail directly to Norway.  The climate became increasingly colder in the 14th and 15th centuries, during the period of colder weather known as the [[Little Ice Age]].\n\nIn 1126 the Roman Catholic Church founded a [[diocese]] at [[Gardar, Greenland|Gar\u00f0ar]] (now [[Igaliku]]). It was subject to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] archdiocese of [[Nidaros]] (now [[Trondheim]]); at least five churches in Norse Greenland are known from archeological remains. In 1261 the population accepted the overlordship of the [[King of Norway]], although it continued to have its own law. In 1380 the Norwegian kingdom entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark. After initially thriving, the Norse settlements in Greenland declined in the 14th century. The Norse abandoned the Western Settlement around 1350. In 1378 there was no longer a [[bishop]] at Gar\u00f0ar. In 1402\u20131404, the [[Black Death]] hit Iceland for the first time and killed approximately half the population there - but there is no evidence that it reached Greenland.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=66333 | title=Hva\u00f0 er helst vita\u00f0 um svartadau\u00f0a \u00e1 \u00cdslandi?}}</ref> The last written record of the [[Norsemen|Norse]] Greenlanders documents a marriage in 1408 at [[Hvalsey Church]], whose ruins are the best-preserved of the Norse buildings of that period.\n\n[[File:Hvalsey Church.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|Hvalsey Church]]\nAfter 1408 few written records mention the settlers.

In ''The Frozen Echo,'' [[Kirsten Seaver]] contests some of the more generally accepted theories about the demise of the Greenland colony, and asserts that the colony, towards the end, was healthier than Diamond and others have thought. Seaver believes that the Greenlanders cannot have starved to death, but rather may have been wiped out by Inuit or unrecorded European attacks, or they may have abandoned the colony for Iceland or [[Vinland]]. However, the physical evidence from archeological studies of the ancient farm sites does not show evidence of attack.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The paucity of personal belongings at these sites is typical of North Atlantic Norse sites that were abandoned in an orderly fashion, with any useful items being deliberately removed; but to others it suggests a gradual but devastating impoverishment. [[Midden]]s at these sites do show an increasingly impoverished diet for humans and livestock. [[Else Roesdahl]] argues that declining ivory prices in Europe due to the influx of Russian and African ivory adversely affected the Norse settlements in Greenland, which depended largely on the export of walrus ivory to Europe.<ref name=\"Seaver 271\u2013292\">{{Cite journal|last=Seaver|first=Kirsten A.|date=2009-07-01|title=Desirable teeth: the medieval trade in Arctic and African ivory |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/div-classtitledesirable-teeth-the-medieval-trade-in-arctic-and-african-ivorya-hreffn1-ref-typefnadiv/50BFF0443A3CF1EB2C011672D54BAC76|journal=Journal of Global History|volume=4|issue=2|pages=271\u2013292|doi=10.1017/S1740022809003155 }}</ref>\n\nGreenland was always colder in winter than Iceland and Norway, and its terrain less hospitable to agriculture. Erosion of the soil was a danger from the beginning, one that the Greenland settlements may not have recognized until it was too late. For an extended time, nonetheless, the relatively warm West Greenland current flowing northwards along the southwestern coast of Greenland made it feasible for the Norse to farm much as their relatives did in Iceland or northern Norway. [[Palynologist]]s' tests on pollen counts and fossilized plants prove that the Greenlanders must have struggled with [[soil erosion]] and [[deforestation]].<ref name=\"Diamond\">{{harvnb|Diamond|2005|p=217,222}}</ref> A Norse farm in the [[Vatnahverfi (Norse Greenland)|Vatnahverfi]] district, excavated in the 1950s, had been buried in layers of drifting sand up to 10 feet deep.

However, from 1300 or so the climate began to cool.

There are limited sources showing the two cultures interacting; however, scholars know that the Norse referred to the Inuit (and Vinland natives) as [[skr\u00e6ling]]. The ''[[Icelandic Annals]]'' are among the few existing sources that confirm contact between the Norse and the Inuit. They report an instance of hostility initiated by the Inuit against the Norse, leaving eighteen Greenlanders dead and two boys carried into slavery.<ref>Fitzhugh and Ward, 2000: p. 336</ref> Archaeological evidence seems to show that the Inuit traded with the Norse. On the other hand, the evidence shows many Norse artefacts at Inuit sites throughout Greenland and on the Canadian Arctic islands but very few Inuit artefacts in the Norse settlements. This may indicate either European indifference\u2014an instance of cultural resistance to Inuit crafts among them\u2014or perhaps hostile raiding by the Inuit. It is also quite possible that the Norse were trading for perishable items such as meat and furs and had little interest in other Inuit items, much as later Europeans who traded with Native Americans.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe Norse never learned the Inuit techniques of [[kayak]] navigation or [[Ringed seal|ring seal]] hunting. Archaeological evidence plainly establishes that by 1300 or so the Inuit had successfully expanded their winter settlements as close to the Europeans as the outer fjords of the Western Settlement.

It is clear that neither Danish and Norwegian nor Icelandic public functionaries were aware that the Norse Greenland colony had ceased to exist. Around 1514, the Norwegian archbishop Erik Valkendorf (Danish by birth, and still loyal to Christian II) planned an expedition to Greenland, which he believed to be part of a continuous northern landmass leading to the New World with all its wealth, and which he fully expected still to have a Norse population, whose members could be pressed anew to the bosom of church and crown after an interval of well over a hundred years.

This has led to much speculation and argument. Most archaeologists reject any decisive judgment based on this one fact, however, as fish bones decompose more quickly than other remains, and may have been disposed of in a different manner.

This led to general confusion between [[Baffin Island]], Greenland, and [[Spitsbergen]], as seen, for example, in the difficulty locating the [[Frobisher Bay|Frobisher \"Strait\"]], which was not confirmed to be a bay until 1861. Nonetheless, interest in discovering a [[Northwest Passage]] to Asia led to repeated expeditions in the area, though none were successful until [[Northwest Passage#Roald Amundsen|Roald Amundsen]] in 1906 and even that success involved his being iced in for two years. [[Christian I of Denmark]] purportedly sent an expedition to the region under [[Hans Pothorst|Pothorst]] and [[Didrik Pining|Pining]] to Greenland in 1472 or 1473; [[Henry VII of England]] sent another under [[John Cabot|Cabot]] in 1497 and 1498; [[Manuel I of Portugal]] sent a third under [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Corte-Real]] in 1500 and 1501.

Around the same time, the merchant [[Jacob Severin]] took over administration of the colony and its trade, and having secured a large royal stipend and full monopoly from the king, successfully repulsed the Dutch in a series of skirmishes in 1738 and 1739. Egede himself quit the colony on the death of his wife, leaving the Lutheran mission to his son [[Paul Egede|Poul]]. Both of them had studied the [[Kalaallisut language]] extensively and published works on it; as well, Poul and some of the other clergy sent by the Mission College, such as [[Otto Fabricius]], began wide-ranging study of Greenland's flora, fauna, and meteorology. However, though kale, lettuce, and other herbs were successfully introduced, repeated attempts to cultivate wheat or clover failed throughout Greenland, limiting the ability to raise European livestock.<ref name=\"BibNar\"/>\n\nAs a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Norway was ceded to [[Sweden]] at the 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]]. The colonies, including Greenland, remained in Danish possession. The 19th century saw increased interest in the region on the part of polar explorers and scientists like [[William Scoresby]] and Greenland-born [[Knud Rasmussen]]. At the same time, the colonial elements of the earlier trade-oriented Danish presence in Greenland expanded. In 1861, the first [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic-language]] journal was founded. Danish law still applied only to the Danish settlers, though. At the turn of the 19th century, the northern part of Greenland was still sparsely populated; only scattered hunting inhabitants were found there.<ref>Nationalmuseet of Denmark. \"[http://www.natmus.dk/sw18658.asp Thule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313215205/http://www.natmus.dk/sw18658.asp |date=2007-03-13 }}\".</ref> During that century, however, Inuit families immigrated from [[British North America]] to settle in these areas. The last group from what later became Canada arrived in 1864. During the same time, the northeastern part of the coast became depopulated following the violent 1783 [[Lakag\u00edgar]] eruption in Iceland.\n\nDemocratic elections for the district assemblies of Greenland were held for the first time in 1862\u20131863, although no assembly for the land as a whole was allowed. In 1888, a party of six led by [[Fridtjof Nansen]] accomplished the first land crossing of Greenland. The men took 41 days to make the crossing on skis, at approximately 64\u00b0N latitude.<ref>Farley Mowat, ''The Polar Passion: The Quest for the North Pole''. McClelland and Stewart, 1967, pp. 199-222</ref> In 1911, two [[Landsting (Greenland)|Landstings]] were introduced, one for northern Greenland and one for southern Greenland, not to be finally merged until 1951. All this time, most decisions were made in [[Copenhagen]], where the Greenlanders had no representation. Towards the end of the 19th century, traders criticized the Danish trade monopoly. It was argued that it kept the natives in non-profitable ways of life, holding back the potentially large fishing industry. Many Greenlanders however were satisfied with the ''status quo'', as they felt the monopoly would secure the future of commercial whaling. It probably did not help that the only contact the local population had with the outside world was with Danish settlers. Nonetheless, the Danes gradually moved over their investments to the fishing industry.\n\nBy 1911, the population was about 14,000, scattered along the southern shores. They were nearly all Christian, thanks to the missionary efforts of Moravians and especially [[Hans Egede]] (1686\u20131758), a Lutheran missionary called \"the Apostle of Greenland.\" He founded Greenland's capital Godth\u00e5b, now known as Nuuk. His grandson [[Hans Egede Saabye]] (1746\u20131817) continued the missionary activities.<ref>Eve Garnett, ''To Greenland's icy mountains; the story of Hans Egede, explorer, coloniser, missionary'' (London: Heinemann. 1968)</ref>\n\n==Polar exploration==\nAt the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, American explorers, including [[Robert Peary]], explored the northern sections of Greenland, which up to that time had been a mystery and were often shown on maps as extending over the North Pole. Peary discovered that Greenland's northern coast in fact stopped well short of the pole. These discoveries were considered to be the basis of an American territorial claim in the area. But after the United States purchased the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]] from Denmark in 1917, it agreed to relinquish all claims on Greenland.\n\n==Strategic importance==\n{{See also|History of Greenland during World War II|Denmark\u2013United_States_relations#Greenland}}\nAfter [[Norway]] regained full independence in 1905, it argued that Danish claims to Greenland were invalid since the island had been a Norwegian possession prior to 1815. In 1931, Norwegian meteorologist [[Hallvard Devold]] occupied uninhabited eastern Greenland, on his own initiative. After the fact, the occupation was supported by the Norwegian government, who claimed the area as [[Erik the Red's Land]].

These well-meaning reforms have led to a number of problems, particularly modern unemployment and the infamous [[Blok P]] housing project. The attempt to introduce European-style urban housing suffered from such inattention to local detail that Inuit could not fit through the doors in their winter clothing and fire escapes were constantly blocked by fishing gear too bulky to fit into the cramped apartments.<ref>Bode, Mike & al. \"[http://www.artonline.jp/BGWG/mikestaffan/index.html Nuuk]\". 2003.

One of the animals found here is the [[polar bear]], which is on the [[coat of arms]] of the Danish royal family in Greenland]] The '''history of Greenland''' is a history of life under extreme [[Arctic]] conditions: currently, an [[ice cap]] covers about 80 percent of the island, restricting human activity largely to the coasts.\n\nThe first humans are thought to have arrived in [[Greenland]] around 2500 BC. Their descendants apparently died out and were succeeded by several other groups migrating from continental [[North America]]. There has been no evidence discovered that Greenland was known to Europeans until the 10th century, when [[Iceland]]ic [[Viking]]s settled on its southwestern coast, which seems to have been uninhabited when they arrived. The ancestors of the [[Inuit]] Greenlanders who live there today appear to have migrated there later, around AD 1200, from northwestern Greenland.  While the Inuit survived in the icy world of the [[Little Ice Age]], the early [[Eastern Settlement|Norse settlements]] along the southwestern coast disappeared, leaving the Inuit as the only inhabitants of the island for several centuries. During this time, [[Denmark-Norway]], apparently believing the Norse settlements had survived, continued to claim sovereignty over the island despite the lack of any contact between the Norse Greenlanders and their Scandinavian brethren. In 1721, aspiring to become a [[Danish colonial empire|colonial power]], Denmark-Norway sent a missionary expedition to Greenland with the stated aim of reinstating Christianity among descendants of the Norse Greenlanders who may have reverted to [[Norse mythology|paganism]]. When the missionaries found no descendants of the Norse Greenlanders, they baptized the Inuit Greenlanders they found living there instead. Denmark-Norway then developed trading colonies along the coast and imposed a trade monopoly and other colonial privileges on the area.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], when Germany invaded Denmark, Greenlanders became socially and economically less connected to Denmark and more connected to the [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/1944-12-27_Yanks_Clear_Greenland_of_Nazis |title=Yanks Clear Greenland of Nazis,1944/12/27 (1944) |author= |date= |website= |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref> After the war, Denmark resumed control of Greenland and in 1953, converted its status from colony to overseas ''[[Amt (subnational entity)|amt]]'' (county).

(The peoples of those islands are thought to have descended, in turn, from inhabitants of [[Siberia]] who migrated into [[Canada]] thousands of years ago.) Because of Greenland's remoteness and climate, survival there was difficult. Over the course of centuries, one culture succeeded another as groups died out and were replaced by new immigrants. [[Archaeology]] can give only approximate dates for the cultures that flourished before the Norse exploration of Greenland in the 10th century.\n\nThe earliest known cultures in Greenland are the [[Saqqaq culture]] (2500\u2013800 BC)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.natmus.dk/sw18632.asp|title=Saqqaq culture chronology|publisher=Sila, the Greenland Research Centre at the National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=2 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419200203/http://www.natmus.dk/sw18632.asp|archivedate=19 April 2011}}</ref> and the [[Independence I culture]] in northern Greenland (2400\u20131300 BC).

During the 980s, explorers led by [[Erik the Red]] set out from [[Iceland]] and reached the southwest coast of Greenland, found the region uninhabited, and subsequently settled there. Erik named the island Greenland (''Gr\u0153nland'' in [[Old Norse]], ''Gr\u00e6nland'' in modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], ''Gr\u00f8nland'' in modern [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]) - in effect as a marketing device.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Both the ''Book of Icelanders'' (''[[\u00cdslendingab\u00f3k]]'', a medieval account of [[Icelandic history]] from the 12th century onward) and the ''[[Saga of Erik the Red|Saga of Eric the Red]]'' (''Eir\u00edks saga rau\u00f0a'', a medieval account of his life and of the Norse settlement of Greenland) state that Erik said that ''it would encourage people to go there that the land had a good name''.\"<ref>Grove, Jonath.

He sailed to Greenland, where he explored the coastline and claimed certain regions as his own. He then returned to Iceland to persuade people to join him in establishing a settlement on Greenland. The Icelandic sagas say that 25 ships left Iceland with Erik the Red in 985, and that only 14 of them arrived safely in Greenland.<ref name=\"The Fate of Greenland's Vikings\">[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/greenland/ The Fate of Greenland's Vikings]</ref> This date has been approximately confirmed by radiocarbon dating of remains at the first settlement at [[Brattahl\u00ed\u00f0|Brattahlid]] (now [[Qassiarsuk]]), which yielded a date of about 1000. According to the sagas, it was also in the year 1000 that Erik's son, [[Leif Eirikson]], left the settlement to explore the regions around [[Vinland]], which historians generally assume to have been located in what is now [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].\n\nThe Norse established settlements along Greenland's fjords. It is possible, that the fjords at that time were surrounded by forests of 4- to 6-metre tall birch trees and by hills covered with grass and willow brush as the [[Qinngua Valley]] currently is, but this hasn't been determined yet. <ref>{{cite web | url = https://ign.ku.dk/english/about/arboreta/arboretum-greenland/forest-plantations/ }}</ref> If the presumption is true then the Norse probably cleared the landscape by felling trees to use as building material and fuel, and by allowing their sheep and goats to graze there in both summer and winter. The occuring soil erosion could have been an important factor in the demise of the colonies, as the land was stripped of its natural cover.\n \nThe Norse settled in three separate locations in south-western Greenland: the larger [[Eastern Settlement]], the smaller [[Western Settlement]], and the still smaller [[Ivittuut|Middle Settlement]] (often considered part of the Eastern one). Estimates put the combined population of the settlements at their height between 2,000 and 10,000, with more recent estimates<ref>N. Lynnerup, in {{harvnb|Fitzhugh|Ward|2000}}</ref> trending toward the lower figure. Archeologists have identified the ruins of approximately 620 farms: 500 in the Eastern Settlement, 95 in the Western Settlement, and 20 in the Middle.\n\n[[File:I. E. C. Rasmussen - Sommernat under den Gr\u00f8nlandske Kyst circa Aar 1000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Summer on the Greenland coast {{circa|1000}}]]\nThe economy of the Norse Greenlanders depended on a combination of pastoral farming with hunting and some fishing. Farmers kept cattle, sheep and goats - shipped into the island - for their milk, cheese and butter, while most of the consumed meat came from hunted caribou and seals. Both individual farmers and groups of farmers organised summer trips to the more northerly [[Disko Bay]] area where they hunted walruses, narwhals and polar bears for their skins, hides and ivory. Besides being used to make garments and shoes, these resources also functioned as a form of currency, as well as making up the most important export commodities.<ref>[https://www.ancient.eu/article/1208/viking-age-greenland/ Viking Age Greenland] ''Ancient History Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nThe settlements carried on a trade in [[ivory trade|ivory]] from [[walrus]] [[tusk]]s with Europe, as well as exporting rope, sheep, seals, wool and cattle hides (according to one 13th-century account). They depended on Iceland and Norway for iron tools, wood (especially for boat building, although they may also have obtained wood from coastal [[Labrador]] - ''[[Markland]]''), supplemental foodstuffs, and religious and social contacts. Trade ships from Iceland and Norway traveled to Greenland every year and would sometimes overwinter in Greenland. Beginning in the late-13th century, laws required all ships from Greenland to sail directly to Norway.  The climate became increasingly colder in the 14th and 15th centuries, during the period of colder weather known as the [[Little Ice Age]].\n\nIn 1126 the Roman Catholic Church founded a [[diocese]] at [[Gardar, Greenland|Gar\u00f0ar]] (now [[Igaliku]]). It was subject to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] archdiocese of [[Nidaros]] (now [[Trondheim]]); at least five churches in Norse Greenland are known from archeological remains. In 1261 the population accepted the overlordship of the [[King of Norway]], although it continued to have its own law. In 1380 the Norwegian kingdom entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark. After initially thriving, the Norse settlements in Greenland declined in the 14th century. The Norse abandoned the Western Settlement around 1350. In 1378 there was no longer a [[bishop]] at Gar\u00f0ar. In 1402\u20131404, the [[Black Death]] hit Iceland for the first time and killed approximately half the population there - but there is no evidence that it reached Greenland.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=66333 | title=Hva\u00f0 er helst vita\u00f0 um svartadau\u00f0a \u00e1 \u00cdslandi?}}</ref> The last written record of the [[Norsemen|Norse]] Greenlanders documents a marriage in 1408 at [[Hvalsey Church]], whose ruins are the best-preserved of the Norse buildings of that period.\n\n[[File:Hvalsey Church.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|Hvalsey Church]]\nAfter 1408 few written records mention the settlers.

In ''The Frozen Echo,'' [[Kirsten Seaver]] contests some of the more generally accepted theories about the demise of the Greenland colony, and asserts that the colony, towards the end, was healthier than Diamond and others have thought. Seaver believes that the Greenlanders cannot have starved to death, but rather may have been wiped out by Inuit or unrecorded European attacks, or they may have abandoned the colony for Iceland or [[Vinland]]. However, the physical evidence from archeological studies of the ancient farm sites does not show evidence of attack.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The paucity of personal belongings at these sites is typical of North Atlantic Norse sites that were abandoned in an orderly fashion, with any useful items being deliberately removed; but to others it suggests a gradual but devastating impoverishment. [[Midden]]s at these sites do show an increasingly impoverished diet for humans and livestock. [[Else Roesdahl]] argues that declining ivory prices in Europe due to the influx of Russian and African ivory adversely affected the Norse settlements in Greenland, which depended largely on the export of walrus ivory to Europe.<ref name=\"Seaver 271\u2013292\">{{Cite journal|last=Seaver|first=Kirsten A.|date=2009-07-01|title=Desirable teeth: the medieval trade in Arctic and African ivory |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/div-classtitledesirable-teeth-the-medieval-trade-in-arctic-and-african-ivorya-hreffn1-ref-typefnadiv/50BFF0443A3CF1EB2C011672D54BAC76|journal=Journal of Global History|volume=4|issue=2|pages=271\u2013292|doi=10.1017/S1740022809003155 }}</ref>\n\nGreenland was always colder in winter than Iceland and Norway, and its terrain less hospitable to agriculture. Erosion of the soil was a danger from the beginning, one that the Greenland settlements may not have recognized until it was too late. For an extended time, nonetheless, the relatively warm West Greenland current flowing northwards along the southwestern coast of Greenland made it feasible for the Norse to farm much as their relatives did in Iceland or northern Norway. [[Palynologist]]s' tests on pollen counts and fossilized plants prove that the Greenlanders must have struggled with [[soil erosion]] and [[deforestation]].<ref name=\"Diamond\">{{harvnb|Diamond|2005|p=217,222}}</ref> A Norse farm in the [[Vatnahverfi (Norse Greenland)|Vatnahverfi]] district, excavated in the 1950s, had been buried in layers of drifting sand up to 10 feet deep.

There are limited sources showing the two cultures interacting; however, scholars know that the Norse referred to the Inuit (and Vinland natives) as [[skr\u00e6ling]]. The ''[[Icelandic Annals]]'' are among the few existing sources that confirm contact between the Norse and the Inuit. They report an instance of hostility initiated by the Inuit against the Norse, leaving eighteen Greenlanders dead and two boys carried into slavery.<ref>Fitzhugh and Ward, 2000: p. 336</ref> Archaeological evidence seems to show that the Inuit traded with the Norse. On the other hand, the evidence shows many Norse artefacts at Inuit sites throughout Greenland and on the Canadian Arctic islands but very few Inuit artefacts in the Norse settlements. This may indicate either European indifference\u2014an instance of cultural resistance to Inuit crafts among them\u2014or perhaps hostile raiding by the Inuit. It is also quite possible that the Norse were trading for perishable items such as meat and furs and had little interest in other Inuit items, much as later Europeans who traded with Native Americans.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe Norse never learned the Inuit techniques of [[kayak]] navigation or [[Ringed seal|ring seal]] hunting.

At the same time, the colonial elements of the earlier trade-oriented Danish presence in Greenland expanded. In 1861, the first [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic-language]] journal was founded. Danish law still applied only to the Danish settlers, though. At the turn of the 19th century, the northern part of Greenland was still sparsely populated; only scattered hunting inhabitants were found there.<ref>Nationalmuseet of Denmark. \"[http://www.natmus.dk/sw18658.asp Thule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313215205/http://www.natmus.dk/sw18658.asp |date=2007-03-13 }}\".</ref> During that century, however, Inuit families immigrated from [[British North America]] to settle in these areas.

All this time, most decisions were made in [[Copenhagen]], where the Greenlanders had no representation. Towards the end of the 19th century, traders criticized the Danish trade monopoly. It was argued that it kept the natives in non-profitable ways of life, holding back the potentially large fishing industry. Many Greenlanders however were satisfied with the ''status quo'', as they felt the monopoly would secure the future of commercial whaling. It probably did not help that the only contact the local population had with the outside world was with Danish settlers. Nonetheless, the Danes gradually moved over their investments to the fishing industry.\n\nBy 1911, the population was about 14,000, scattered along the southern shores. They were nearly all Christian, thanks to the missionary efforts of Moravians and especially [[Hans Egede]] (1686\u20131758), a Lutheran missionary called \"the Apostle of Greenland.\" He founded Greenland's capital Godth\u00e5b, now known as Nuuk.

Peary discovered that Greenland's northern coast in fact stopped well short of the pole. These discoveries were considered to be the basis of an American territorial claim in the area. But after the United States purchased the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]] from Denmark in 1917, it agreed to relinquish all claims on Greenland.\n\n==Strategic importance==\n{{See also|History of Greenland during World War II|Denmark\u2013United_States_relations#Greenland}}\nAfter [[Norway]] regained full independence in 1905, it argued that Danish claims to Greenland were invalid since the island had been a Norwegian possession prior to 1815. In 1931, Norwegian meteorologist [[Hallvard Devold]] occupied uninhabited eastern Greenland, on his own initiative. After the fact, the occupation was supported by the Norwegian government, who claimed the area as [[Erik the Red's Land]]. Two years later, the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] ruled in favor of Denmark.\n\n[[Image:ThuleAirBase.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Thule Air Base]], established after [[World War II]], is the northernmost base of the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] ]]\n\n=== World War II ===\nDuring [[World War II]], when [[Nazi Germany]] extended its war operations to Greenland, [[Henrik Kauffmann]], the [[Danish Ambassador to the United States|Danish Minister to the United States]]&nbsp;\u2014 who had already refused to recognize the German occupation of Denmark&nbsp;\u2014 signed a treaty with the United States on April 9, 1941, granting permission to establish stations in Greenland.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://arcticjournal.com/culture/2968/sledge-patrol|title=The Sledge Patrol|work=The Arctic Journal|access-date=2017-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308222716/http://arcticjournal.com/culture/2968/sledge-patrol|archive-date=2017-03-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> Kauffmann did this without the knowledge of the Danish government, and consequently \"the Danish government accused him of high treason, fired him and told him to come home immediately \u2013 none of which had any result\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Because it was difficult for the Danish government to govern the island during the war, and because of successful exports, especially of [[cryolite]], Greenland came to enjoy a rather independent status.

In 1953, some Inuit families were forced by Denmark to move from their homes to provide space for extension of the base. For this reason, the base has been a source of friction between the Danish government and the Greenlandic people. In the [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash]] of January 21, 1968, four [[hydrogen bomb]]s contaminated the area with radioactive debris.  Although most of the contaminated ice was cleaned up, one of the bombs was not accounted for.  A 1995 Danish parliamentary scandal, dubbed [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash#Thulegate|Thulegate]], highlighted that nuclear weapons were routinely present in Greenland's airspace in the years leading up to the accident, and that Denmark had tacitly given the go-ahead for this activity despite its official nuclear free policy.\n\nThe United States upgraded the [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System]] to a [[phased array]] radar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcus.org/publications/downloads/greenland.pdf |title=Greenland: Security Perspectives |author=Taagholt, J\u00f8rgen & Jens Claus Hansen (Trans.

In the end, the [[Royal Greenland Trading Department]]'s monopolies were finally removed. In 1953, Greenland was raised from the status of colony to that of an autonomous province or [[Countries of the Kingdom of Denmark|constituent country]] of the [[Danish Realm]]. Greenland was also assigned its own [[Counties of Denmark|Danish county]]. Despite its small population, it was provided nominal representation in the Danish [[Folketing]].\n\nA plantation of exotic arctic trees was created in 1954 near [[Narsarsuaq]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ign.ku.dk/om/arboreter/arboret-groenland/skovplantninger/ | title=Skovplantninger i Det Gr\u00f8nlandske Arboret| date=2013-10-10}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greenland flag on building.jpg|thumb|right|222px|[[Blok P]], the largest building in Greenland and formerly home to about 1% of its population, was demolished on October 19, 2012.]]\nDenmark also began a number of reforms aimed at urbanizing the Greenlanders, principally to replace their dependence on (then) dwindling seal populations and provide workers for the (then) swelling cod fisheries, but also to provide improved social services such as health care, education, and transportation. These well-meaning reforms have led to a number of problems, particularly modern unemployment and the infamous [[Blok P]] housing project. The attempt to introduce European-style urban housing suffered from such inattention to local detail that Inuit could not fit through the doors in their winter clothing and fire escapes were constantly blocked by fishing gear too bulky to fit into the cramped apartments.<ref>Bode, Mike & al. \"[http://www.artonline.jp/BGWG/mikestaffan/index.html Nuuk]\". 2003. Accessed 15 May 2012.</ref> Television broadcasts began in 1982. The collapse of the cod fisheries and mines in the late 1980s and early 1990s greatly damaged the economy, which now principally depends on Danish aid and cold-water shrimp exports. Large sectors of the economy remain controlled by state-owned corporations, with [[Air Greenland]] and the [[Arctic Umiaq Line|Arctic Umiaq ferry]] heavily subsidized to provide access to remote settlements. The major airport remains the former [[United States Air Force|US]] air base at [[Kangerlussuaq]] well north of Nuuk, with the capital unable to accept international flights on its own, owing to concerns about expense and noise pollution.\n\nGreenland's minimal representation in the Folketing meant that despite 70.3% of Greenlanders rejecting entry into the European [[European Economic Community|Common Market]] (EEC), it was pulled in along with Denmark in 1973. Fears that the [[customs union]] would allow foreign firms to compete and [[overfish]] its waters were quickly realized and the local parties began to push strongly for increased autonomy. The Folketing approved devolution in 1978 and the next year enacted [[Home rule#Greenland|home rule]] under a local [[Parliament of Greenland|Landsting]]. On 23 February 1982, a bare majority (53%) of Greenland's population voted to leave the EEC, a process which lasted until 1985. This resulted in The Greenland Treaty of 1985.<ref name=\"Treaty of 1985\">Government of Greenland. \"[https://naalakkersuisut.gl/en/Naalakkersuisut/Greenland-Representation-to-the-EU/European-Union-and-Greenland/The-Greenland-Treaty-of-1985 The Greenland Treaty of 1985]\". Accessed 2 October 2018.</ref>\n\n[[Greenland Home Rule]] has become increasingly Greenlandized, rejecting Danish and avoiding regional dialects to standardize the country under the language and culture of the [[Kalaallit]] (West Greenland Inuit). The capital [[Godth\u00e5b]] was renamed [[Nuuk]] in 1979; a [[flag of Greenland|local flag]] was adopted in 1985; the Danish KGH became the locally administered [[Kalaallit Niuerfiat]] (now [[KNI A/S]]) in 1986. Following a successful [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|referendum on self-government]] in 2008, the local parliament's powers were expanded and Danish was removed as an official language in 2009.\n\n[[International relations]] are now largely, but not entirely, also left to the discretion of the home rule government. As part of the treaty controlling Greenland's exit of the EEC, Greenland was declared a \"special case\" with access to the EEC market as a constituent country of Denmark, which remains a member.<ref name=\"Treaty of 1985\" /> Greenland is also a member of several small organizations{{which|date=May 2012}} along with [[Iceland]], the [[Faroe Islands|Faroes]], and the Inuit populations of [[Nunavut|Canada]] and Russia.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} It was one of the founders of the environmental [[Arctic Council]] in 1996. The US military bases on the island remain a major issue, with some politicians pushing for renegotiation of the 1951 US&ndash;Denmark treaty by the Home Rule government.

Prior to the creation of the [[County of London]] in 1889, Sydenham was located in [[Kent]], bordering [[Surrey]]. Historically, the area was very affluent, with [[the Crystal Palace]] being relocated to [[Sydenham Hill]] in 1854. Today, Sydenham is a diverse area, with a population of 28,378 (2011 census)<ref name=\"Sydenham population 2\"/> and borders [[Forest Hill, London|Forest Hill]], [[Dulwich]], [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]], [[Penge]], [[Beckenham]], [[Catford]] and [[Bellingham, London|Bellingham]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lewisham Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the Sydenham ward of Lewisham Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916.]]\nOriginally known as '''Shippenham''',<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Sydenham|url=http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/lewisham/assets/histories/sydenham|website=Ideal Homes: A History of South East London Suburbs|accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref> Sydenham began as a small settlement, a few cottages among the woods, whose inhabitants grazed their animals and collected wood. In the 1640s, springs of water in what is now [[Sydenham Wells Park|Wells Park]] were discovered to have medicinal properties, attracting crowds of people to the area. Sydenham grew rapidly in the 19th century after the introduction of the [[Croydon Canal]] in 1809 which linked the [[Grand Surrey Canal]] to [[Croydon]] and a [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] was constructed in Sydenham. However, the canal was never successful and closed in 1836<ref name=hadfield374>{{harvnb|Hadfield|1969|p=374}}</ref> resulting in it being the first canal to be abandoned by an Act of Parliament. The [[London & Croydon Railway]] purchased the canal for \u00a340,250 and quickly converted the alignment for a railway from [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] to [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]], opening in 1839. After the railway opened potential gas companies began to consider the Sydenham area with the Crystal Palace and District Gas Company having works at Bell Green, which continued production until 1969; a retail park now occupies most of the site.\n\n[[File:Crystal Palace General view from Water Temple.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The Crystal Palace]]\n\nIn 1851 the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park was housed in an immense glass building, called [[the Crystal Palace]]. In 1854 the building was bought by a private company, dismantled and re-erected in Sydenham Park (now called [[Crystal Palace Park]]). Exhibitions, concerts, conferences and sporting events were held at the Crystal Palace (until it burned down in 1936), and Sydenham became a fashionable area; many new houses were built. In 1872, the Children's Hospital, Sydenham opened. It closed in 1991, its services being now part of the [[University Hospital Lewisham]].<ref>http://www.ezits.myzen.co.uk/childrensydenham.html</ref>\n\nIn 1860, the [[Walter Cobb (department store)|Walter Cobb]] department store at Lawrie Place, Kirkdale (now known as Cobbs Corner) opened, lasting until the 1980s. In 1884, [[Upper Sydenham railway station]] opened on the [[Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway]] linking Crystal Palace to London Victoria via Peckham Rye.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butt |first=R.V.J. |title=The Directory of Railway Stations |year=1995 |publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd |location=Yeovil |isbn=978-1-85260-508-7 |id=R508 |page=237 |ref=harv }}</ref> The station and the line were poorly used despite new houses being built in the area, as passengers preferred to use other stations near-by [[Sydenham Hill railway station|Sydenham Hill]] (opening in 1863), [[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace (Lower Level)]] and Sydenham which were on more direct routes. The ill fate of the Crystal Palace in 1936 saw patronage reduced and the route finally closed in 1954.\n\nSydenham was attacked by enemies during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The gas works were a target, but were never damaged. The railway which ran through Upper Sydenham station was damaged, and some homes in the area were destroyed.\n\n==Local area==\nSydenham is divided into several localities:\n[[File:Sydenham Hill Apartments.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Apartment building on Sydenham Hill]]\n'''[[Sydenham Hill]]''' in the Boroughs of Lewisham and Southwark runs alongside Dulwich and Sydenham Woods on one of the highest points of Greater London being 112 metres above sea level.<ref>[http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/LondonBoroughs.php Hill Bagging: Tallest Hills of London] Retrieved 9 June 2013</ref> From here, the City of London skyline is visible. Sydenham Hill has an abandoned railway tunnel from the [[Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway]] located within the Woods. Another railway tunnel (one of the longest in Britain being 1,958 metres) goes beneath on the [[Chatham Main Line]] with {{rws|Sydenham Hill}} station at the London end serving both Sydenham Hill and the College area of Dulwich.\n\n'''Upper Sydenham''' is also located on Sydenham Hill and is a part of the Parish of [[St Bartholomew]]. It is diverse both racially and in terms of income; the central section of Kirkdale was Sydenham's original High Street. Renamed \"Kirkdale\" in 1936, the area now has a small range of shops including [[Costcutter]], [[Tesco Express]], local pubs and off-licences. Sydenham School is located on Dartmouth Road with Forest Hill Library and Forest Hill Pools alongside Thorpewood Avenue. Green Flag awarded [[Sydenham Wells Park]], the location of the once famous Springs is one of the largest parks within the postcode. Upper Sydenham is also the location of the Sydenham Park allotments, the Sydenham electricity sub station which had a major fire in 2008<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7443326.stm BBC News: Blaze at sub-station investigated] Retrieved 9 June 2013</ref> and the Sydenham Hill estate.\n\n'''Lower Sydenham & Bell Green''' is the location of the Sydenham Community Library, formally run and funded by the local council. Alongside to the library is Home Park and the Home Park estate. The Bridge Leisure Centre is located on Kangley Bridge Road, near to {{rws|Lower Sydenham}} railway station and Sydenham industrial estate. The industrial estate is home to the Clarkes of London coach company, Beckenham and Sydenham Cricket Ground and many other businesses. Bell Green retail park houses the Sydenham Gas Works and a large [[Sainsbury's]] superstore, formally part of the [[Savacentre]] brand. Other retailers include [[B&Q]], [[Currys|Currys PC World]], [[Next plc|Next]] (with [[Costa Coffee]]), [[Toys \"R\" Us]] and [[McDonald's]] among others.\n\n===Commercial area===\nSydenham's main commercial area begins on Kirkdale around Cobbs Corner, continuing onto Sydenham Road, often known as \"Sydenham High Street\". It houses many independent shops, including a bakery, bookshop and several restaurants. Furthermore, Sydenham is noted for the number of independent coffee shops.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bloomfield|first1=Ruth|title=Where to buy in London 2017: south-east London is the place to invest, says report that links house price growth with coffee shop openings|url=http://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/property-news/london-s-homes-hotspots-2017-southeast-london-is-the-place-to-invest-says-new-report-that-links-a109031.html#gallery|accessdate=31 May 2017|agency=Evening Standard, Homes & Property|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=23 March 2017}}</ref> Chain stores include [[Boots UK|Boots]], [[Nando's]], [[Lidl]], [[Morley's]], [[Sainsbury's Local]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Superdrug]] and [[Tesco Express]].

Prior to the creation of the [[County of London]] in 1889, Sydenham was located in [[Kent]], bordering [[Surrey]]. Historically, the area was very affluent, with [[the Crystal Palace]] being relocated to [[Sydenham Hill]] in 1854. Today, Sydenham is a diverse area, with a population of 28,378 (2011 census)<ref name=\"Sydenham population 2\"/> and borders [[Forest Hill, London|Forest Hill]], [[Dulwich]], [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]], [[Penge]], [[Beckenham]], [[Catford]] and [[Bellingham, London|Bellingham]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lewisham Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the Sydenham ward of Lewisham Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916.]]\nOriginally known as '''Shippenham''',<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Sydenham|url=http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/lewisham/assets/histories/sydenham|website=Ideal Homes: A History of South East London Suburbs|accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref> Sydenham began as a small settlement, a few cottages among the woods, whose inhabitants grazed their animals and collected wood. In the 1640s, springs of water in what is now [[Sydenham Wells Park|Wells Park]] were discovered to have medicinal properties, attracting crowds of people to the area. Sydenham grew rapidly in the 19th century after the introduction of the [[Croydon Canal]] in 1809 which linked the [[Grand Surrey Canal]] to [[Croydon]] and a [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] was constructed in Sydenham. However, the canal was never successful and closed in 1836<ref name=hadfield374>{{harvnb|Hadfield|1969|p=374}}</ref> resulting in it being the first canal to be abandoned by an Act of Parliament. The [[London & Croydon Railway]] purchased the canal for \u00a340,250 and quickly converted the alignment for a railway from [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] to [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]], opening in 1839. After the railway opened potential gas companies began to consider the Sydenham area with the Crystal Palace and District Gas Company having works at Bell Green, which continued production until 1969; a retail park now occupies most of the site.\n\n[[File:Crystal Palace General view from Water Temple.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The Crystal Palace]]\n\nIn 1851 the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park was housed in an immense glass building, called [[the Crystal Palace]]. In 1854 the building was bought by a private company, dismantled and re-erected in Sydenham Park (now called [[Crystal Palace Park]]). Exhibitions, concerts, conferences and sporting events were held at the Crystal Palace (until it burned down in 1936), and Sydenham became a fashionable area; many new houses were built. In 1872, the Children's Hospital, Sydenham opened. It closed in 1991, its services being now part of the [[University Hospital Lewisham]].<ref>http://www.ezits.myzen.co.uk/childrensydenham.html</ref>\n\nIn 1860, the [[Walter Cobb (department store)|Walter Cobb]] department store at Lawrie Place, Kirkdale (now known as Cobbs Corner) opened, lasting until the 1980s. In 1884, [[Upper Sydenham railway station]] opened on the [[Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway]] linking Crystal Palace to London Victoria via Peckham Rye.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butt |first=R.V.J. |title=The Directory of Railway Stations |year=1995 |publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd |location=Yeovil |isbn=978-1-85260-508-7 |id=R508 |page=237 |ref=harv }}</ref> The station and the line were poorly used despite new houses being built in the area, as passengers preferred to use other stations near-by [[Sydenham Hill railway station|Sydenham Hill]] (opening in 1863), [[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace (Lower Level)]] and Sydenham which were on more direct routes. The ill fate of the Crystal Palace in 1936 saw patronage reduced and the route finally closed in 1954.\n\nSydenham was attacked by enemies during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The gas works were a target, but were never damaged. The railway which ran through Upper Sydenham station was damaged, and some homes in the area were destroyed.\n\n==Local area==\nSydenham is divided into several localities:\n[[File:Sydenham Hill Apartments.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Apartment building on Sydenham Hill]]\n'''[[Sydenham Hill]]''' in the Boroughs of Lewisham and Southwark runs alongside Dulwich and Sydenham Woods on one of the highest points of Greater London being 112 metres above sea level.<ref>[http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/LondonBoroughs.php Hill Bagging: Tallest Hills of London] Retrieved 9 June 2013</ref> From here, the City of London skyline is visible.

Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] against the [[Kingdom of France]]. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the '''Senior Service'''.\n\nFrom the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the [[Dutch Navy]] and later with the [[French Navy]] for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th century, it was the world's most powerful navy until the [[Second World War]]. The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the [[British Empire]] as the [[superpower|unmatched world power]] during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries. Due to this historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it as \"the Royal Navy\" without qualification.\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size,<ref>Rose, ''Power at Sea'', p. 36</ref> although at the onset of [[World War II]] it was still the world's largest. During the [[Cold War]], the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine force]], hunting for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarines and mostly active in the [[GIUK gap]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], its focus has returned to [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] operations [[Standing Royal Navy deployments|around the world]] and it remains one of the world's foremost [[blue-water navy|blue-water navies]].<ref>Hyde-Price, ''European Security'', pp. 105\u2013106.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Royal Navy: Britain\u2019s Trident for a Global Agenda |date=4 November 2006 |url=http://henryjacksonsociety.org/2006/11/04/the-royal-navy-britains-trident-for-a-global-agenda/ |publisher=[[Henry Jackson Society]] |accessdate=4 November 2006 |quote=Britannia, with her shield and trident, is the very symbol, not only of the Royal Navy, but also of British global power.

There is no evidence that William adopted or kept the Anglo-Saxon ship mustering system, known as the ''scipfryd.'' Hardly noted after 1066, it appears that the Normans let the ''scipfryd'' languish so that by 1086, when the [[Doomsday Book]] was completed, it had apparently ceased to exist.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Safeguard of the Sea, A Naval History of Britain 660\u20131649|last=Roger|first=N.|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=London|pages=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', in 1068, [[Harold Godwinson]]'s sons [[Godwin, son of Harold Godwinson|Godwine]] and [[Edmund, son of Harold Godwinson|Edmund]] conducted a \"raiding-ship army\" which came from Ireland, raiding across the region and to the townships of [[Bristol]] and [[Somerset]]. In the following year of 1069, they returned with a bigger fleet which they sailed up the River Taw before being beaten back by a local earl near [[Devon]]. However, this made explicitly clear that the newly conquered England under Norman rule, in effect, ceded the Irish Sea to the Irish, the Vikings of Dublin, and other Norwegians.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Wartime|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|pages=225\u2013226}}</ref> Besides ceding away the Irish Sea, the Normans also ceded the North Sea, a major area where Nordic peoples traveled. In 1069, this lack of naval presence in the North Sea allowed for the invasion and ravaging of England by Jarl Osborn (brother of [[Sweyn II of Denmark|King Svein Estridsson]]) and his sons [[Harald III of Denmark|Harald]], [[Canute IV of Denmark|Cnut]], and Bjorn. In addition to the ravaging of the English townships of [[Dover]], [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Ipswich]], and [[Norwich]], the Danes connected with the ''aetheling'' (Anglo-Saxon Heir to the crown) Edgar and rebels in Northumbria. William chased Edgar and the rebels to Scotland, but could not defeat the Danes, causing him to resort to the old Anglo-Saxon practice of paying them off.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|last=Michael|first=Swanton|publisher=|year=1069|isbn=|location=London|pages=202\u2013204}}</ref>\n\nThough William the Conqueror caused a massive decline in English naval practices, he did occasionally assemble small fleets of ships, but only for limited activities. Most of these limited actions also did not involve direct combat at sea. An example of this was when the rebellious Anglo-Saxon [[Morcar|Earl Morcar]] and his ally Bishop [[\u00c6thelwine (bishop of Durham)|\u00c6thelwine]] of Durham sought refuge on the [[Isle of Ely]] in 1071. According to [[Florence of Worcester]] reported, \"The king [William the Conqueror] hearing of this, blocked up every outlet on the eastern side by means of boatmen [butescarls], and caused a bridge two miles long to be constructed on the western side.\" The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' also confirms these events. Though William used ships for blockading purposes and for important strategic engagements, his infrequent use of an established navy promoted a damaging practice of infrequent maritime operations, which his successors would practice on frequent basis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|page=226}}</ref>\n\nMedieval fleets, in England as elsewhere, were almost entirely composed of merchant ships enlisted into naval service in time of war. From time to time a few \"king's ships\" owned by the monarch were built for specifically warlike purposes; but, unlike some European states, England did not maintain a small permanent core of warships in peacetime. England's naval organisation was haphazard and the mobilization of fleets when war broke out was slow.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 52\u201353, 117\u2013130.</ref>\n\n=====Barons' Revolt and the evolving English Navy, 1215\u20131217=====\nWhen [[John, King of England|King John]]\u2019s campaign to recover Normandy from the French was at a breaking-point, the northern barons of England began to rise in revolt. Forced by the insurrection, John signed the [[Magna Carta]] on 15 June 1215, in hopes of satisfying the barons to buy time for [[Pope Innocent III]] to excommunicate the rebellious barons and condemn the Magna Carta. From this, the barons revolted, commencing the [[First Barons' War]] with the capture of [[Rochester Castle]]. Grasping, however, that they (the barons) were outmatched by royalists and King John, the barons decided to turn to France for assistance. Realizing the baron's intentions, John attempted to assemble a Navy, to prevent the arrival of the French.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Flowers of History|author=Roger of Wendover|author-link=Roger of Wendover|translator-last=Giles|translator-first=J.

With John unable to swiftly build up his navy, due to the adopting of infrequent maritime operations from William the Conqueror, the French Navy under Louis invaded and landed at Sandwich unopposed in April 1216.<ref name=\":0\" /> With Louis near London, John fled to [[Winchester]], where he would stay until his death on 19 October 1216, having his nine-year-old son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] as heir to the throne.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Dues de Normandie et des Rois d'Angleterre|last=Michel|first=F.|publisher=|year=1840|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=172\u2013177}}</ref>\n\nParadoxically, John's death turned the tide against Louis, the rebellion in England, and the development of the English navy. [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]], who became regent to the son of the recently deceased English king, began to regain the loyalties to the royalist cause through a regimen of compromise. Among these were the [[Cinque Ports]], who had substantial amounts of maritime ships. With the English now having substantial amount of vessels, Louis returned to France to gather reinforcements and more maritime vessels. Though he succeeded, English vessels began to [[blockade]] and harass French shipping, trade, and blockaded multiple French-controlled English ports.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183\u2013185}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-1217, English royalists began to gain the advantage over the rebellious Barons and their French allies. Again needing more troops, Louis requested from his wife [[Blanche of Castile]] to assemble more troops for him. Up to the task, Blanche assisted in gathering forces for her husband, with a massive French force being assembled by August 1217, at the port of Calais. At the head of the French transports was [[Eustace the Monk]], Louis\u2019 best naval commander, who had helped Louis escape many English blockade, such as the one in Winchelsea&nbsp; in January 1217.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=|page=232}}</ref>\n\nThe subsequent encounter between the two fleets came in the Downs off Sandwich, known as the [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Battle of Sandwich]]. For the first time in northern waters a decisive naval battle was fought on the open sea. The battle was dominated by the English, with French losing almost all of their ships, including Eustace the Monk who was killed in the action that took place. With the death of Eustace the Monk and the defeat of the French at Sandwich, William Marshal was able to isolate Louis in London, compelling him to renounce his claim to the English throne and force him to return to France.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=198\u2013205}}</ref>\n\n=====Scottish and English Navies, 1249\u20131318===== \nThere are mentions in medieval records of fleets commanded by Scottish kings including [[William the Lion]]<ref name=\"Tytler1829pp309-10\">P.

However, while subsequent French invasion schemes came to nothing, England's naval forces could not prevent frequent raids on the south-coast ports by the French and their [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] allies. Such raids halted finally only with the occupation of northern France by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 91\u201397, 99\u2013116, 143\u2013144.</ref>\n\n[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] deserves a large share of credit in fostering sea power.

This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal [[man-of-war]] near his palace at [[Cardross, Argyll and Bute|Cardross]] on the [[River Clyde]].

After an indecisive engagement with the English off [[Gravelines]], the Armada ran out of ammunition. The Spanish had expended 125,000 cannonballs against the English.

In the 1690s, two separate schemes for larger naval forces were put in motion. As usual, the larger part was played by the merchant community rather than the government. The first was the [[Darien Scheme]] to found a Scottish colony in Spanish controlled America. It was undertaken by the [[Company of Scotland]], who created a fleet of five ships, including ''Caledonia'' and ''St. Andrew'', all built or chartered in Holland and Hamburg. It sailed to the [[Isthmus of Darien]] in 1698, but the venture failed and only one ship returned to Scotland.<ref>A. I. MacInnes and A. H.

Amphibious operations by the Anglo-Dutch fleet brought about the capture of [[Sardinia]], the [[Balearic Islands]] and a number of Spanish mainland ports, most importantly [[Barcelona]]. While most of these gains were turned over to the Habsburgs, Britain held on to [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]], which were retained in the peace settlement, providing the Navy with Mediterranean bases. Early in the war French naval squadrons had done considerable damage to English and Dutch commercial convoys. However, a major victory over France and Spain at [[Battle of Vigo Bay|Vigo Bay]] (1702), further successes in battle, and the scuttling of the entire French Mediterranean fleet at [[Toulon]] in 1707 virtually cleared the Navy's opponents from the seas for the latter part of the war.

For much of the war this submarine campaign was restricted by [[prize rules]] requiring merchant ships to be warned and evacuated before sinking. In 1915, the Germans renounced these restrictions and began to sink merchant ships on sight, but later returned to the previous [[rules of engagement]] to placate neutral opinion. A resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 raised the prospect of Britain and its allies being starved into submission. The Navy's response to this new form of warfare had proved inadequate due to its refusal to adopt a [[convoy]] system for merchant shipping, despite the demonstrated effectiveness of the technique in protecting troop ships.

By 1938, treaty limits were effectively being ignored. The re-armament of the Royal Navy was well under way by this point; the Royal Navy had begun construction of the still treaty-affected and undergunned [[King George V-class battleship (1939)|new battleships]] and its first full-sized purpose-built aircraft carriers. In addition to new construction, several existing old battleships (whose gun power offset to a significant extent the weakly armed new battleships), battlecruisers and heavy cruisers were reconstructed, and anti-aircraft weaponry reinforced, while new technologies, such as [[ASDIC]], [[Huff-Duff]] and [[hydrophones]], were developed. The Navy had lost control of naval aviation when the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] was merged with the [[Royal Flying Corps]] to form the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1918, but regained control of ship-board aircraft with the return of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] to Naval control in 1937.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/pages/fleet_air_arm_history/history.shtml |title=The History of the Fleet Air Arm Officers Association, FAAOA |work=fleetairarmoa.org |accessdate=8 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418115613/http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/pages/fleet_air_arm_history/history.shtml |archive-date=18 April 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===1939\u20131945===\n{{Main|Naval history of World War II}}\n[[File:HM King George VI greeting the Flag Officers of the Home Fleet on board the flagship HMS DUKE OF YORK at Scapa Flow, 16 August 1943.

A traditional convoy system was instituted from the start of the war, but German submarine tactics, based on group attacks by \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolf-packs]]\", were much more effective than in the previous war, and the threat remained serious for well over three years. Defences were strengthened by deployment of purpose-built escorts, of [[escort carrier]]s, of long-range patrol aircraft, improved anti-submarine weapons and sensors, and by the deciphering of German signals by the code-breakers of [[Bletchley Park]]. The threat was at last effectively broken by devastating losses inflicted on the U-boats in the spring of 1943. Intense convoy battles of a different sort, against combined air, surface and submarine threats, were fought off enemy-controlled coasts in [[Arctic convoys of World War II|the Arctic]], where Britain ran supply convoys through to Russia, and in the Mediterranean, where the struggle focused on [[Malta convoys|Convoys to Malta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbournestar.co.uk/Operation_Pedestal.html|title=Operation Pedestal|publisher=Melbourne Star|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223001713/http://www.melbournestar.co.uk/Operation_Pedestal.html|archive-date=23 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Navy was also vital in guarding the sea lanes that enabled British forces to fight in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Far East.

All of the pre-war ships (except for the {{sclass2-|Town|cruiser|0||1936}} light cruisers) were quickly retired and most sold for scrapping over the years 1945\u20131948, and only the best condition ships (the four surviving ''King George V''-class battleships, carriers, cruisers, and some destroyers) were retained and refitted for service. The increasingly powerful United States Navy took on the former role of the Royal Navy as global naval power and police force of the sea. The combination of the threat of the Soviet Union, and Britain's commitments throughout the world, created a new role for the Navy. Governments since the Second World War have had to balance commitments with increasing budgetary pressures, partly due to the increasing cost of weapons systems, what historian [[Paul Kennedy]] called the [[Upward Spiral]].<ref>Kennedy, 1989, pp. 570\u2013571.</ref>\n\nThese pressures were exacerbated by bitter inter-service rivalry.

A plan was drawn up for three large aircraft carriers, each displacing about 60,000&nbsp;tons; the plan was designated [[CVA-01]]. These carriers would be able to operate the latest aircraft coming into service and keep the Royal Navy's place as a major naval power. The new [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government that came to power in 1964 was determined to cut defence expenditure as a means to reduce public spending, and in the [[1966 Defence White Paper]] the project was cancelled.<ref>Eric J.

At the beginning of the 1980s, the Royal Navy was a force focused on blue-water anti-submarine warfare. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic, and to operate the nuclear deterrent submarine force. For a time ''Hermes'' was retained, along with all three of the ''Invincible''-class light aircraft carriers. More Sea Harriers were ordered; not just to replace losses, but to also increase the size of the [[Fleet Air Arm]]. New and more capable ships were built; notably the [[Type 42 destroyer|''Sheffield''-class destroyers]], the [[Type 21 frigate|Type 21]], [[Type 22 frigate|Type 22]], and [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23]] [[frigate]]s, new LPDs of the {{sclass-|Albion|landing platform dock|4}}, and {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}, but never in the numbers of the ships that they replaced.

Submarines are styled HM Submarine, also abbreviated \"HMS\". Names are allocated to ships and submarines by a naming committee within the MOD and given by class, with the names of ships within a class often being thematic (for example, the [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23s]] are named after [[Duke#United Kingdom|British dukes]]) or traditional (for example, the {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s all carry the names of famous historic ships). Names are frequently re-used, offering a new ship the rich heritage, battle honours and traditions of her predecessors. Often, a particular vessel class will be named after the first ship of that type to be built.

Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] against the [[Kingdom of France]]. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the '''Senior Service'''.\n\nFrom the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the [[Dutch Navy]] and later with the [[French Navy]] for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th century, it was the world's most powerful navy until the [[Second World War]]. The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the [[British Empire]] as the [[superpower|unmatched world power]] during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries. Due to this historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it as \"the Royal Navy\" without qualification.\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size,<ref>Rose, ''Power at Sea'', p. 36</ref> although at the onset of [[World War II]] it was still the world's largest. During the [[Cold War]], the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine force]], hunting for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarines and mostly active in the [[GIUK gap]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], its focus has returned to [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] operations [[Standing Royal Navy deployments|around the world]] and it remains one of the world's foremost [[blue-water navy|blue-water navies]].<ref>Hyde-Price, ''European Security'', pp. 105\u2013106.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Royal Navy: Britain\u2019s Trident for a Global Agenda |date=4 November 2006 |url=http://henryjacksonsociety.org/2006/11/04/the-royal-navy-britains-trident-for-a-global-agenda/ |publisher=[[Henry Jackson Society]] |accessdate=4 November 2006 |quote=Britannia, with her shield and trident, is the very symbol, not only of the Royal Navy, but also of British global power.

There is no evidence that William adopted or kept the Anglo-Saxon ship mustering system, known as the ''scipfryd.'' Hardly noted after 1066, it appears that the Normans let the ''scipfryd'' languish so that by 1086, when the [[Doomsday Book]] was completed, it had apparently ceased to exist.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Safeguard of the Sea, A Naval History of Britain 660\u20131649|last=Roger|first=N.|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=London|pages=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', in 1068, [[Harold Godwinson]]'s sons [[Godwin, son of Harold Godwinson|Godwine]] and [[Edmund, son of Harold Godwinson|Edmund]] conducted a \"raiding-ship army\" which came from Ireland, raiding across the region and to the townships of [[Bristol]] and [[Somerset]]. In the following year of 1069, they returned with a bigger fleet which they sailed up the River Taw before being beaten back by a local earl near [[Devon]]. However, this made explicitly clear that the newly conquered England under Norman rule, in effect, ceded the Irish Sea to the Irish, the Vikings of Dublin, and other Norwegians.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Wartime|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|pages=225\u2013226}}</ref> Besides ceding away the Irish Sea, the Normans also ceded the North Sea, a major area where Nordic peoples traveled. In 1069, this lack of naval presence in the North Sea allowed for the invasion and ravaging of England by Jarl Osborn (brother of [[Sweyn II of Denmark|King Svein Estridsson]]) and his sons [[Harald III of Denmark|Harald]], [[Canute IV of Denmark|Cnut]], and Bjorn. In addition to the ravaging of the English townships of [[Dover]], [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Ipswich]], and [[Norwich]], the Danes connected with the ''aetheling'' (Anglo-Saxon Heir to the crown) Edgar and rebels in Northumbria. William chased Edgar and the rebels to Scotland, but could not defeat the Danes, causing him to resort to the old Anglo-Saxon practice of paying them off.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|last=Michael|first=Swanton|publisher=|year=1069|isbn=|location=London|pages=202\u2013204}}</ref>\n\nThough William the Conqueror caused a massive decline in English naval practices, he did occasionally assemble small fleets of ships, but only for limited activities. Most of these limited actions also did not involve direct combat at sea. An example of this was when the rebellious Anglo-Saxon [[Morcar|Earl Morcar]] and his ally Bishop [[\u00c6thelwine (bishop of Durham)|\u00c6thelwine]] of Durham sought refuge on the [[Isle of Ely]] in 1071. According to [[Florence of Worcester]] reported, \"The king [William the Conqueror] hearing of this, blocked up every outlet on the eastern side by means of boatmen [butescarls], and caused a bridge two miles long to be constructed on the western side.\" The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' also confirms these events. Though William used ships for blockading purposes and for important strategic engagements, his infrequent use of an established navy promoted a damaging practice of infrequent maritime operations, which his successors would practice on frequent basis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|page=226}}</ref>\n\nMedieval fleets, in England as elsewhere, were almost entirely composed of merchant ships enlisted into naval service in time of war. From time to time a few \"king's ships\" owned by the monarch were built for specifically warlike purposes; but, unlike some European states, England did not maintain a small permanent core of warships in peacetime. England's naval organisation was haphazard and the mobilization of fleets when war broke out was slow.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 52\u201353, 117\u2013130.</ref>\n\n=====Barons' Revolt and the evolving English Navy, 1215\u20131217=====\nWhen [[John, King of England|King John]]\u2019s campaign to recover Normandy from the French was at a breaking-point, the northern barons of England began to rise in revolt. Forced by the insurrection, John signed the [[Magna Carta]] on 15 June 1215, in hopes of satisfying the barons to buy time for [[Pope Innocent III]] to excommunicate the rebellious barons and condemn the Magna Carta. From this, the barons revolted, commencing the [[First Barons' War]] with the capture of [[Rochester Castle]]. Grasping, however, that they (the barons) were outmatched by royalists and King John, the barons decided to turn to France for assistance. Realizing the baron's intentions, John attempted to assemble a Navy, to prevent the arrival of the French.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Flowers of History|author=Roger of Wendover|author-link=Roger of Wendover|translator-last=Giles|translator-first=J.

With John unable to swiftly build up his navy, due to the adopting of infrequent maritime operations from William the Conqueror, the French Navy under Louis invaded and landed at Sandwich unopposed in April 1216.<ref name=\":0\" /> With Louis near London, John fled to [[Winchester]], where he would stay until his death on 19 October 1216, having his nine-year-old son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] as heir to the throne.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Dues de Normandie et des Rois d'Angleterre|last=Michel|first=F.|publisher=|year=1840|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=172\u2013177}}</ref>\n\nParadoxically, John's death turned the tide against Louis, the rebellion in England, and the development of the English navy. [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]], who became regent to the son of the recently deceased English king, began to regain the loyalties to the royalist cause through a regimen of compromise. Among these were the [[Cinque Ports]], who had substantial amounts of maritime ships. With the English now having substantial amount of vessels, Louis returned to France to gather reinforcements and more maritime vessels. Though he succeeded, English vessels began to [[blockade]] and harass French shipping, trade, and blockaded multiple French-controlled English ports.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183\u2013185}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-1217, English royalists began to gain the advantage over the rebellious Barons and their French allies. Again needing more troops, Louis requested from his wife [[Blanche of Castile]] to assemble more troops for him. Up to the task, Blanche assisted in gathering forces for her husband, with a massive French force being assembled by August 1217, at the port of Calais. At the head of the French transports was [[Eustace the Monk]], Louis\u2019 best naval commander, who had helped Louis escape many English blockade, such as the one in Winchelsea&nbsp; in January 1217.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=|page=232}}</ref>\n\nThe subsequent encounter between the two fleets came in the Downs off Sandwich, known as the [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Battle of Sandwich]]. For the first time in northern waters a decisive naval battle was fought on the open sea. The battle was dominated by the English, with French losing almost all of their ships, including Eustace the Monk who was killed in the action that took place. With the death of Eustace the Monk and the defeat of the French at Sandwich, William Marshal was able to isolate Louis in London, compelling him to renounce his claim to the English throne and force him to return to France.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=198\u2013205}}</ref>\n\n=====Scottish and English Navies, 1249\u20131318===== \nThere are mentions in medieval records of fleets commanded by Scottish kings including [[William the Lion]]<ref name=\"Tytler1829pp309-10\">P.

In the 1690s, two separate schemes for larger naval forces were put in motion. As usual, the larger part was played by the merchant community rather than the government. The first was the [[Darien Scheme]] to found a Scottish colony in Spanish controlled America.

For much of the war this submarine campaign was restricted by [[prize rules]] requiring merchant ships to be warned and evacuated before sinking. In 1915, the Germans renounced these restrictions and began to sink merchant ships on sight, but later returned to the previous [[rules of engagement]] to placate neutral opinion. A resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 raised the prospect of Britain and its allies being starved into submission. The Navy's response to this new form of warfare had proved inadequate due to its refusal to adopt a [[convoy]] system for merchant shipping, despite the demonstrated effectiveness of the technique in protecting troop ships. The belated introduction of convoys sharply reduced losses and brought the U-boat threat under control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-naval-convoy-system-introduced|title=British naval convoy system introduced|publisher=History|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051642/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-naval-convoy-system-introduced|archive-date=31 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal h85716.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}}]]\nIn the inter-war period, the Royal Navy was stripped of much of its power.

In addition to new construction, several existing old battleships (whose gun power offset to a significant extent the weakly armed new battleships), battlecruisers and heavy cruisers were reconstructed, and anti-aircraft weaponry reinforced, while new technologies, such as [[ASDIC]], [[Huff-Duff]] and [[hydrophones]], were developed. The Navy had lost control of naval aviation when the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] was merged with the [[Royal Flying Corps]] to form the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1918, but regained control of ship-board aircraft with the return of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] to Naval control in 1937.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/pages/fleet_air_arm_history/history.shtml |title=The History of the Fleet Air Arm Officers Association, FAAOA |work=fleetairarmoa.org |accessdate=8 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418115613/http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/pages/fleet_air_arm_history/history.shtml |archive-date=18 April 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===1939\u20131945===\n{{Main|Naval history of World War II}}\n[[File:HM King George VI greeting the Flag Officers of the Home Fleet on board the flagship HMS DUKE OF YORK at Scapa Flow, 16 August 1943.

A traditional convoy system was instituted from the start of the war, but German submarine tactics, based on group attacks by \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolf-packs]]\", were much more effective than in the previous war, and the threat remained serious for well over three years. Defences were strengthened by deployment of purpose-built escorts, of [[escort carrier]]s, of long-range patrol aircraft, improved anti-submarine weapons and sensors, and by the deciphering of German signals by the code-breakers of [[Bletchley Park]]. The threat was at last effectively broken by devastating losses inflicted on the U-boats in the spring of 1943. Intense convoy battles of a different sort, against combined air, surface and submarine threats, were fought off enemy-controlled coasts in [[Arctic convoys of World War II|the Arctic]], where Britain ran supply convoys through to Russia, and in the Mediterranean, where the struggle focused on [[Malta convoys|Convoys to Malta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbournestar.co.uk/Operation_Pedestal.html|title=Operation Pedestal|publisher=Melbourne Star|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223001713/http://www.melbournestar.co.uk/Operation_Pedestal.html|archive-date=23 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Navy was also vital in guarding the sea lanes that enabled British forces to fight in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Far East.

All of the pre-war ships (except for the {{sclass2-|Town|cruiser|0||1936}} light cruisers) were quickly retired and most sold for scrapping over the years 1945\u20131948, and only the best condition ships (the four surviving ''King George V''-class battleships, carriers, cruisers, and some destroyers) were retained and refitted for service. The increasingly powerful United States Navy took on the former role of the Royal Navy as global naval power and police force of the sea. The combination of the threat of the Soviet Union, and Britain's commitments throughout the world, created a new role for the Navy. Governments since the Second World War have had to balance commitments with increasing budgetary pressures, partly due to the increasing cost of weapons systems, what historian [[Paul Kennedy]] called the [[Upward Spiral]].<ref>Kennedy, 1989, pp. 570\u2013571.</ref>\n\nThese pressures were exacerbated by bitter inter-service rivalry.

A plan was drawn up for three large aircraft carriers, each displacing about 60,000&nbsp;tons; the plan was designated [[CVA-01]]. These carriers would be able to operate the latest aircraft coming into service and keep the Royal Navy's place as a major naval power. The new [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government that came to power in 1964 was determined to cut defence expenditure as a means to reduce public spending, and in the [[1966 Defence White Paper]] the project was cancelled.<ref>Eric J.

At the beginning of the 1980s, the Royal Navy was a force focused on blue-water anti-submarine warfare. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic, and to operate the nuclear deterrent submarine force. For a time ''Hermes'' was retained, along with all three of the ''Invincible''-class light aircraft carriers. More Sea Harriers were ordered; not just to replace losses, but to also increase the size of the [[Fleet Air Arm]]. New and more capable ships were built; notably the [[Type 42 destroyer|''Sheffield''-class destroyers]], the [[Type 21 frigate|Type 21]], [[Type 22 frigate|Type 22]], and [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23]] [[frigate]]s, new LPDs of the {{sclass-|Albion|landing platform dock|4}}, and {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}, but never in the numbers of the ships that they replaced.

Submarines are styled HM Submarine, also abbreviated \"HMS\". Names are allocated to ships and submarines by a naming committee within the MOD and given by class, with the names of ships within a class often being thematic (for example, the [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23s]] are named after [[Duke#United Kingdom|British dukes]]) or traditional (for example, the {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s all carry the names of famous historic ships). Names are frequently re-used, offering a new ship the rich heritage, battle honours and traditions of her predecessors. Often, a particular vessel class will be named after the first ship of that type to be built.

It was designed to burn [[bituminous coal]] mined by the [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]] (DEVCO) at the nearby Lingan Colliery and the adjacent Phalen Colliery as a means of reducing Nova Scotia's reliance of foreign oil for electrical generation.\n\n==History==\nIn the years following [[World War II]], Nova Scotia, in common with many other areas of the world, turned to oil to fire its generating stations to such an extent that 70% of its electricity was then generated from oil. Formation of the [[1973 oil crisis|OPEC cartel in 1973]] brought an end to low-priced oil and the price of electricity produced from burning oil increased dramatically. Nova Scotia\u2019s solution to the international oil crisis was to exploit a provincial natural resource, coal.<ref name=\"IEEE\">{{cite web |last1=Kee |first1=Fred |title=Electric Utilities across Canada |url=https://www.ieee.ca/diglib/library/electricity/pdf/P_one_4.pdf |website=IEEE Canada |publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Canada |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Technical characteristics==\nThe Lingan Generating Station consists of four 150 MW units commissioned between 1979 and 1984.
