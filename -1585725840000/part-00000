TouchWiz is available only on Samsung devices. It is sometimes incorrectly identified as an operating system. TouchWiz is used internally by Samsung for [[smartphone]]s, [[feature phone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s, and is not available for licensing by external parties. The Android version of TouchWiz also comes with the Samsung-made [[app store]] [[Samsung Galaxy Apps|Galaxy Apps]].\n\nThe first, original edition of TouchWiz, released in 2008. This 1.0 version is officially launched with the original Samsung Solstice<ref>https://www.phonearena.com/reviews/Samsung-Solstice-A887-Review_id2236</ref> in 2009. The latest version of TouchWiz is TouchWiz 6.0, which is on the [[Samsung Galaxy J1 mini Prime]] and TouchWiz Nature UX 5.0 on the [[Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016)]] feature a more refined user interface as compared to the previous versions found on Samsung's older phones released prior to Galaxy S5's release. The status bar is now transparent during home screen mode in TouchWiz Nature UX 2.0 and TouchWiz Nature UX 2.5. In TouchWiz 4.0 on [[Samsung Galaxy S II|Galaxy S II]] and the [[Samsung Galaxy Note (original)|Galaxy Note]] (both later updated to Nature UX), some of the features added include panning and tilt,<ref name=\":0\">[http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/13582/what-are-the-features-that-touchwiz-has-that-stock-android-does-not-have What are the features that TouchWiz has that stock Android does not have?]</ref> which makes use of the accelerometer and gyroscope in the phone to detect motion.\n\nTouchWiz was abandoned by Samsung in late 2016 in favor of [[Samsung Experience]]. TouchWiz is used by Samsung's own proprietary operating systems, [[Bada]] and [[Samsung REX|REX]],<ref name=\":0\" /> as well as phones based on the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system. It is also present in phones running the [[Tizen]] operating system.\n\nTouchWiz was a central issue in ''[[Apple v. Samsung]]''.\n\n==History==\n<!--\n===TouchWiz 1.0===\nThis was the original edition of TouchWiz, released in 2008, with pre-introduction (trial) on SGH-F480. This version is officially launched with the original [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung Solstice]]<ref>https://www.phonearena.com/reviews/Samsung-Solstice-A887-Review_id2236</ref> in 2009. Various versions of TouchWiz 1.0, with different features, were used on Solstice's siblings such as the Samsung Eternity, Impression, [[Samsung SGH-T749|Impact]] and [[Samsung SGH-T749|Highlight]].<ref>https://www.phonearena.com/reviews/Samsung-Solstice-A887-Review_id2236</ref>\n\n===TouchWiz 2.0===\nThis was the original second edition of TouchWiz, released in 2009. This version premiered with the [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung Solstice 2]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/samsung-solstice-ii-sgh/4505-6454_7-34209336.html|title=Samsung Solstice II SGH-A817 (AT&T)|publisher=[[Cnet|CNET]]|date=November 17, 2010}}</ref> in 2010.\n-->\n\n===TouchWiz 3.0===\n[[File:Samsung Galaxy Mini.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Samsung Galaxy Mini|Galaxy Mini]] using TouchWiz 3.0]]\n\nReleased in 2010, to support [[Android Froyo]] (2.1 \u2013 2.2). This version premiered with the [[Samsung Galaxy S]]. A lite version of TouchWiz 3.0, with reduced features, was used on the Samsung Galaxy Proclaim.\n\n===TouchWiz 4.0===\n[[File:Samsung I9100.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Samsung Galaxy S II|Galaxy S II]] using TouchWiz 4.0]]\n\nThe second version of TouchWiz was released in 2011, to support [[Android Gingerbread]] and [[Android Honeycomb]] (2.3 - 3.2.6). The [[Samsung Galaxy S II|Galaxy S II]] was the first device preloaded with TouchWiz 4.0. This version includes better [[hardware acceleration]] than 3.0, as well multiple touchscreen options involving [[Multi-touch#Multi-touch gestures|multi-touch gestures]] and using the phone's [[accelerometer]]. One such feature allows users to place two fingers on the screen and tilt the device towards and away from themselves, to zoom in and out, respectively. \"Panning\" on TouchWiz 4.0 allows users to scroll through [[home screen]]s by moving the device from side to side.\n\n===TouchWiz Nature UX===\nThe third version of TouchWiz was renamed to TouchWiz Nature UX. It was released in 2012 and supported [[Android Ice Cream Sandwich]] (4.0). The [[Samsung Galaxy S III|Galaxy S III]], [[Samsung Galaxy Star|Galaxy Star]] and [[Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1|Galaxy Note 10.1]] were the first devices preloaded with this version, although a lite version was used beforehand on the [[Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0]]. TouchWiz Nature UX contains more interactive elements than previous version, such as a water ripple effect on the lock screen, and \"smart stay\", a feature which uses [[eye tracking]] technology to determine if the user is still watching the screen. To complement the TouchWiz interface, and as a response to Apple's [[Siri]], this version introduces [[S Voice]], Samsung's [[intelligent personal assistant]].\n\nThe [[colour palette]] of the user interface has been adapted to the colours of nature, prominently green (plants, forest, grass) and blue (ocean, sky), to visually represent the slogan \u201cInspired by Nature\u201d.\n\nThis version of TouchWiz also utilized many [[colour gradient]]s.\n\n===TouchWiz Nature UX 2.0===\n[[File:Galaxy S4 with TouchWiz.png|thumb|upright|Samsung Galaxy S4 using TouchWiz on [[Android Jelly Bean]]]]\n\nThis version supports [[Android Jellybean]] (4.2.2) and was released in 2013; the [[Samsung Galaxy S4]] was the first device to use TouchWiz Nature UX 2.0. Even more eye tracking abilities were introduced with this version, such as \"smart scroll\", which allows users to scroll down and up on webpages by tilting their head downwards and upwards, respectively.\n\n===TouchWiz Nature UX 2.5===\nTouchWiz Nature UX 2.5 was released in 2013 to support the last updates to [[Android Jelly Bean|Android Jellybean]] (4.3 - 4.4), and was first used on the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 3|Galaxy Note 3]] and the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition|Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition]]. This version completely supports the [[Samsung Knox]] security solution, as well as [[multi-user]] capabilities. The camera was also improved in this update: [[shutter lag]] was reduced, and features like a 360\u00b0 [[panorama]] mode were added.\n\n===TouchWiz Nature UX 3.0===\nThis update was released in 2014 to support [[Android KitKat]]. It was first seen on the [[Samsung Galaxy S5|Galaxy S5]], [[Galaxy K Zoom]] and the [[Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2|Galaxy Note Pro 12.2]]. It later appeared on the [[Galaxy Alpha]].\n\nThe home screen and settings menu were made more user-friendly with larger icons and less clutter. Also, icons in the [[context menu]]s were removed for [[minimalism#ui|minimalism]],<ref name=contextmenu>[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1IRA6fA9yYs/U4Vz146wPmI/AAAAAAAAB1w/hXq02Y3v3ug/s1600/use+buddy+photo+share+in+Galaxy+S4.png Context menu on the Galaxy S4 (2013, with icons)] and [https://i0.wp.com/www.gottabemobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gs5-history.jpg on the Galaxy S5 (2014, without icons)]</ref> and any disabled options, where previously they would have been visible but unusable ([[grayed out]]), now do not show up at all.\n\nThe new [[colour palette]] utilizes oceanic colours (e.g. ''<code>#006578</code>, <code>#00151C</code>, <code>#004754</code>, <code>#009ba1</code>, <code>#005060</code>, <code>#0034da</code> and <code>#001d27</code>''<ref name=S5-menu>[http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lcocSf2Ud0U/U7tw629n9GI/AAAAAAAACZw/bgOynnRk_CM/s1600/enable+disable+power+saving+via+quick+settings+panel+in+Galaxy+S5.png Galaxy S5 quick toggle settings menu (or ''\u201ccontrol panel\u201d; \u201ccontrol center\u201d'') screenshot.]</ref><ref name=S5-settings>[https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/121718-gallery/Screenshot-2014-05-26-13-28-36.png Samsung Galaxy S5 screenshot: ''settings''].

This version has an  ultra-power-saving mode, which drastically extends the battery duration by making the screen [[grayscale]], restricting the apps that can be used, and turning off features like [[Wi-Fi]] and [[Bluetooth]].\n\n=== TouchWiz Nature UX 3.5===\nThis is a slightly modified version of TouchWiz Nature UX 3.0, released in 2014 for the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 4|Galaxy Note 4]], [[Samsung Galaxy Note Edge|Galaxy Note Edge]] and [[Samsung Galaxy A series|Galaxy A-series (2015)]]. Most of the changes made were minor, aesthetic ones, including an overhaul of the cluttered settings menu, the inclusion of quick setting shortcuts and centralization of the lock screen clock. However, the camera application was stripped down to its most basic features, nonetheless gaining an [[Autofocus|AF]]/[[Exposure (photography)#Automatic exposure|AE]] lock.\n\n===TouchWiz Nature UX 4.0===\nThis version comes with [[Samsung Galaxy S5|Galaxy S5]], and so supports [[Android Lollipop]] and was released in 2015. Update 4.0 eventually became available to the [[Samsung Galaxy S5|Galaxy S5]], [[Samsung Galaxy Note 3|Note 3]], [[Samsung Galaxy Note 4|Note 4]], and other Lollipop-compatible devices, but with less features.\n\nThis version of TouchWiz continued the design that was initially seen on the Galaxy S5, with slightly more rounded icons, but also incorporated Lollipop's additions and changes, such as making the notification [[Drop-down list|drop-down menu]] merely an overlay instead of a full-screen drawer. TouchWiz Nature UX 4.0 also included a visual overhaul for the whole system, changing the black background in system apps to a white theme, similar to TouchWiz UX 3.5 seen on the Note 4 & A series. The black theme had been in place since the original [[Samsung Galaxy S|Galaxy S]], because it reduced battery consumption as Samsung mainly uses [[AMOLED]] display technology. It was changed because of a patent licensing deal with [[Google]], which required that the TouchWiz interface follow the design of \"stock\" Android more closely.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2014/02/24/google-has-strangled-the-innovation-out-of-the-samsung-galaxy-s5s-touchwiz-ui/#3805e4e557b7|title=Google Has Strangled The Innovation Out Of The Samsung Galaxy S5's TouchWiz UI|last=Spence|first=Ewan|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===TouchWiz 5.0===\nWith TouchWiz 5.0, Samsung reverted to the earlier, simpler naming system, without the \"Nature UX\" infix, to reflect aesthetic changes. This version was released in 2015 primarily for the [[Samsung Galaxy S6]], and supports later updates to [[Android Lollipop]] (5.0.2 - 5.1.1). This update cleaned up the user interface, reduced the number of duplicate functions, and used brighter and simpler colours with icon shadows.\n\nA new version of TouchWiz 5.0 was released in September 2015 for the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 5|Galaxy Note 5]] and [[Samsung Galaxy S6|S6 Edge+]]. The new version features updated iconography, with stock apps now featuring \"[[squircle]]\" icons instead of freeform.\n\nMid-range and entry-level devices feature a version named <nowiki>''</nowiki>TouchWiz Essence 2.0<nowiki>''</nowiki>. It is similar to TouchWiz 5.0 but icon shadows are not included along with or without Theme Support. It is comparatively lighter, faster and featured on devices such as the 2016 [[Samsung Galaxy A series|A series]], [[Samsung Galaxy A8 (2015)|Galaxy A8]], [[Galaxy S5 Neo]], [[Samsung Galaxy Tab series|tablets]] and the [[Samsung Galaxy J series|J series]] devices which run Android Lollipop. It also doesn't feature the Sparkling Bubbles lockscreen effect exclusive to [[Samsung Galaxy S6|Galaxy S6 devices]] and the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 5|Note 5]].\n\n===TouchWiz 6.0===\nThis version of TouchWiz began during initial beta testing of [[Android Marshmallow]] on the [[Samsung Galaxy S6|Galaxy S6]] in December 2015, for users who had signed up for the beta program,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-marshmallow-beta-program-664080/|title=(Update: UK too) Samsung launches a Marshmallow beta program for the Galaxy S6 in Korea|last=Bogdan|first=Petrovan|date=23 December 2015|website=Android Authority|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-03-13}}</ref> and became formally available in February 2016. It features a redesigned notification drop-down and colour overhaul, replacing the original blue and green hue to white. This version also removed the weather while centring and enlarging the clock on the [[lock screen]], as well as bringing back the ability to customize the shortcuts on the lock screen. Icons are slightly modified with a flatter look, removing the shadows that featured previously. The Smart Manager was removed as an app, and was moved to a settings option instead.\n\nOn this version, Samsung also added the ability to change the [[Pixel density|display density]] setting, although this was initially only accessible through a third-party app as the setting was hidden by the system. An update to the [[Samsung Galaxy S7|Galaxy S7]] and S7 Edge made it official, allowing users to change it under the display settings.\n\nTouchWiz 6.0 also includes Google's additions to Android: Doze and App Standby to improve battery performance (although Samsung's own app optimization feature remains available, thus meaning there are two separate \"app optimization\" settings: one within the Smart Manager app, and the other within the battery usage screen), Now on Tap to quickly access the [[intelligent personal assistant]] [[Google Now]], and Permission Control to limit the permissions granted to a particular application.\n\n===TouchWiz Grace UX===\n{{main|Samsung Experience}}\n\nFirst released with the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 7]] for [[Android Marshmallow]], the Grace UX was named after the device's codename, and eventually made its way to older devices, including the Galaxy Note 5 through an update, the [[Samsung Galaxy S7|Galaxy S7]] and S7 Edge through the official [[Android Nougat]] update. The Grace UX features a cleaner, flatter look to iconography and extensive use of white space. TouchWiz Grace UX devices also benefit from the Secure Folder functionality, which enables users to keep certain data, and even apps, behind a secure password.\n\nIn addition, for most countries, all the languages that were absent from previous versions ([[Android Marshmallow]] or earlier) will be available in this release, starting with the [[Samsung Galaxy Tab S3|Galaxy Tab S3]].\n\n==Phones

interface created, designed and developed by [[Samsung Electronics]] with partners, featuring a full [[touch user interface]]. TouchWiz is available only on Samsung devices. It is sometimes incorrectly identified as an operating system. TouchWiz is used internally by Samsung for [[smartphone]]s, [[feature phone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s, and is not available for licensing by external parties. The Android version of TouchWiz also comes with the Samsung-made [[app store]] [[Samsung Galaxy Apps|Galaxy Apps]].\n\nThe first, original edition of TouchWiz, released in 2008. This 1.0 version is officially launched with the original Samsung Solstice<ref>https://www.phonearena.com/reviews/Samsung-Solstice-A887-Review_id2236</ref> in 2009. The latest version of TouchWiz is TouchWiz 6.0, which is on the [[Samsung Galaxy J1 mini Prime]] and TouchWiz Nature UX 5.0 on the [[Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016)]] feature a more refined user interface as compared to the previous versions found on Samsung's older phones released prior to Galaxy S5's release. The status bar is now transparent during home screen mode in TouchWiz Nature UX 2.0 and TouchWiz Nature UX 2.5. In TouchWiz 4.0 on [[Samsung Galaxy S II|Galaxy S II]] and the [[Samsung Galaxy Note (original)|Galaxy Note]] (both later updated to Nature UX), some of the features added include panning and tilt,<ref name=\":0\">[http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/13582/what-are-the-features-that-touchwiz-has-that-stock-android-does-not-have What are the features that TouchWiz has that stock Android does not have?]</ref> which makes use of the accelerometer and gyroscope in the phone to detect motion.\n\nTouchWiz was abandoned by Samsung in late 2016 in favor of [[Samsung Experience]]. TouchWiz is used by Samsung's own proprietary operating systems, [[Bada]] and [[Samsung REX|REX]],<ref name=\":0\" /> as well as phones based on the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system. It is also present in phones running the [[Tizen]] operating system.\n\nTouchWiz was a central issue in ''[[Apple v. Samsung]]''.\n\n==History==\n<!--\n===TouchWiz 1.0===\nThis was the original edition of TouchWiz, released in 2008, with pre-introduction (trial) on SGH-F480. This version is officially launched with the original [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung Solstice]]<ref>https://www.phonearena.com/reviews/Samsung-Solstice-A887-Review_id2236</ref> in 2009. Various versions of TouchWiz 1.0, with different features, were used on Solstice's siblings such as the Samsung Eternity, Impression, [[Samsung SGH-T749|Impact]] and [[Samsung SGH-T749|Highlight]].<ref>https://www.phonearena.com/reviews/Samsung-Solstice-A887-Review_id2236</ref>\n\n===TouchWiz 2.0===\nThis was the original second edition of TouchWiz, released in 2009. This version premiered with the [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung Solstice 2]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/samsung-solstice-ii-sgh/4505-6454_7-34209336.html|title=Samsung Solstice II SGH-A817 (AT&T)|publisher=[[Cnet|CNET]]|date=November 17, 2010}}</ref> in 2010.\n-->\n\n===TouchWiz 3.0===\n[[File:Samsung Galaxy Mini.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Samsung Galaxy Mini|Galaxy Mini]] using TouchWiz 3.0]]\n\nReleased in 2010, to support [[Android Froyo]] (2.1 \u2013 2.2). This version premiered with the [[Samsung Galaxy S]]. A lite version of TouchWiz 3.0, with reduced features, was used on the Samsung Galaxy Proclaim.\n\n===TouchWiz 4.0===\n[[File:Samsung I9100.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Samsung Galaxy S II|Galaxy S II]] using TouchWiz 4.0]]\n\nThe second version of TouchWiz was released in 2011, to support [[Android Gingerbread]] and [[Android Honeycomb]] (2.3 - 3.2.6). The [[Samsung Galaxy S II|Galaxy S II]] was the first device preloaded with TouchWiz 4.0. This version includes better [[hardware acceleration]] than 3.0, as well multiple touchscreen options involving [[Multi-touch#Multi-touch gestures|multi-touch gestures]] and using the phone's [[accelerometer]]. One such feature allows users to place two fingers on the screen and tilt the device towards and away from themselves, to zoom in and out, respectively. \"Panning\" on TouchWiz 4.0 allows users to scroll through [[home screen]]s by moving the device from side to side.\n\n===TouchWiz Nature UX===\nThe third version of TouchWiz was renamed to TouchWiz Nature UX. It was released in 2012 and supported [[Android Ice Cream Sandwich]] (4.0). The [[Samsung Galaxy S III|Galaxy S III]], [[Samsung Galaxy Star|Galaxy Star]] and [[Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1|Galaxy Note 10.1]] were the first devices preloaded with this version, although a lite version was used beforehand on the [[Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0]]. TouchWiz Nature UX contains more interactive elements than previous version, such as a water ripple effect on the lock screen, and \"smart stay\", a feature which uses [[eye tracking]] technology to determine if the user is still watching the screen. To complement the TouchWiz interface, and as a response to Apple's [[Siri]], this version introduces [[S Voice]], Samsung's [[intelligent personal assistant]].\n\nThe [[colour palette]] of the user interface has been adapted to the colours of nature, prominently green (plants, forest, grass) and blue (ocean, sky), to visually represent the slogan \u201cInspired by Nature\u201d.\n\nThis version of TouchWiz also utilized many [[colour gradient]]s.\n\n===TouchWiz Nature UX 2.0===\n[[File:Galaxy S4 with TouchWiz.png|thumb|upright|Samsung Galaxy S4 using TouchWiz on [[Android Jelly Bean]]]]\n\nThis version supports [[Android Jellybean]] (4.2.2) and was released in 2013; the [[Samsung Galaxy S4]] was the first device to use TouchWiz Nature UX 2.0. Even more eye tracking abilities were introduced with this version, such as \"smart scroll\", which allows users to scroll down and up on webpages by tilting their head downwards and upwards, respectively.\n\n===TouchWiz Nature UX 2.5===\nTouchWiz Nature UX 2.5 was released in 2013 to support the last updates to [[Android Jelly Bean|Android Jellybean]] (4.3 - 4.4), and was first used on the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 3|Galaxy Note 3]] and the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition|Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition]]. This version completely supports the [[Samsung Knox]] security solution, as well as [[multi-user]] capabilities. The camera was also improved in this update: [[shutter lag]] was reduced, and features like a 360\u00b0 [[panorama]] mode were added.\n\n===TouchWiz Nature UX 3.0===\nThis update was released in 2014 to support [[Android KitKat]]. It was first seen on the [[Samsung Galaxy S5|Galaxy S5]], [[Galaxy K Zoom]] and the [[Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2|Galaxy Note Pro 12.2]]. It later appeared on the [[Galaxy Alpha]].\n\nThe home screen and settings menu were made more user-friendly with larger icons and less clutter. Also, icons in the [[context menu]]s were removed for [[minimalism#ui|minimalism]],<ref name=contextmenu>[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1IRA6fA9yYs/U4Vz146wPmI/AAAAAAAAB1w/hXq02Y3v3ug/s1600/use+buddy+photo+share+in+Galaxy+S4.png Context menu on the Galaxy S4 (2013, with icons)] and [https://i0.wp.com/www.gottabemobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gs5-history.jpg on the Galaxy S5 (2014, without icons)]</ref> and any disabled options, where previously they would have been visible but unusable ([[grayed out]]), now do not show up at all.\n\nThe new [[colour palette]] utilizes oceanic colours (e.g. ''<code>#006578</code>, <code>#00151C</code>, <code>#004754</code>, <code>#009ba1</code>, <code>#005060</code>, <code>#0034da</code> and <code>#001d27</code>''<ref name=S5-menu>[http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lcocSf2Ud0U/U7tw629n9GI/AAAAAAAACZw/bgOynnRk_CM/s1600/enable+disable+power+saving+via+quick+settings+panel+in+Galaxy+S5.png Galaxy S5 quick toggle settings menu (or ''\u201ccontrol panel\u201d; \u201ccontrol center\u201d'') screenshot.]</ref><ref name=S5-settings>[https://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/121718-gallery/Screenshot-2014-05-26-13-28-36.png Samsung Galaxy S5 screenshot: ''settings''].

This version has an  ultra-power-saving mode, which drastically extends the battery duration by making the screen [[grayscale]], restricting the apps that can be used, and turning off features like [[Wi-Fi]] and [[Bluetooth]].\n\n=== TouchWiz Nature UX 3.5===\nThis is a slightly modified version of TouchWiz Nature UX 3.0, released in 2014 for the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 4|Galaxy Note 4]], [[Samsung Galaxy Note Edge|Galaxy Note Edge]] and [[Samsung Galaxy A series|Galaxy A-series (2015)]]. Most of the changes made were minor, aesthetic ones, including an overhaul of the cluttered settings menu, the inclusion of quick setting shortcuts and centralization of the lock screen clock. However, the camera application was stripped down to its most basic features, nonetheless gaining an [[Autofocus|AF]]/[[Exposure (photography)#Automatic exposure|AE]] lock.\n\n===TouchWiz Nature UX 4.0===\nThis version comes with [[Samsung Galaxy S5|Galaxy S5]], and so supports [[Android Lollipop]] and was released in 2015. Update 4.0 eventually became available to the [[Samsung Galaxy S5|Galaxy S5]], [[Samsung Galaxy Note 3|Note 3]], [[Samsung Galaxy Note 4|Note 4]], and other Lollipop-compatible devices, but with less features.\n\nThis version of TouchWiz continued the design that was initially seen on the Galaxy S5, with slightly more rounded icons, but also incorporated Lollipop's additions and changes, such as making the notification [[Drop-down list|drop-down menu]] merely an overlay instead of a full-screen drawer. TouchWiz Nature UX 4.0 also included a visual overhaul for the whole system, changing the black background in system apps to a white theme, similar to TouchWiz UX 3.5 seen on the Note 4 & A series. The black theme had been in place since the original [[Samsung Galaxy S|Galaxy S]], because it reduced battery consumption as Samsung mainly uses [[AMOLED]] display technology. It was changed because of a patent licensing deal with [[Google]], which required that the TouchWiz interface follow the design of \"stock\" Android more closely.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2014/02/24/google-has-strangled-the-innovation-out-of-the-samsung-galaxy-s5s-touchwiz-ui/#3805e4e557b7|title=Google Has Strangled The Innovation Out Of The Samsung Galaxy S5's TouchWiz UI|last=Spence|first=Ewan|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===TouchWiz 5.0===\nWith TouchWiz 5.0, Samsung reverted to the earlier, simpler naming system, without the \"Nature UX\" infix, perhaps to reflect aesthetic changes. This version was released in 2015 primarily for the [[Samsung Galaxy S6]], and supports later updates to [[Android Lollipop]] (5.0.2 - 5.1.1). This update cleaned up the user interface, reduced the number of duplicate functions, and used brighter and simpler colours with icon shadows.\n\nA new version of TouchWiz 5.0 was released in September 2015 for the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 5|Galaxy Note 5]] and [[Samsung Galaxy S6|S6 Edge+]]. The new version features updated iconography, with stock apps now featuring \"[[squircle]]\" icons instead of freeform.\n\n===TouchWiz 6.0===\nThis version of TouchWiz began during initial beta testing of [[Android Marshmallow]] on the [[Samsung Galaxy S6|Galaxy S6]] in December 2015, for users who had signed up for the beta program,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-marshmallow-beta-program-664080/|title=(Update: UK too) Samsung launches a Marshmallow beta program for the Galaxy S6 in Korea|last=Bogdan|first=Petrovan|date=23 December 2015|website=Android Authority|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-03-13}}</ref> and became formally available in February 2016. It features a redesigned notification drop-down and colour overhaul, replacing the original blue and green hue to white. This version also removed the weather while centring and enlarging the clock on the [[lock screen]], as well as bringing back the ability to customize the shortcuts on the lock screen. Icons are slightly modified with a flatter look, removing the shadows that featured previously. The Smart Manager was removed as an app, and was moved to a settings option instead.\n\nOn this version, Samsung also added the ability to change the [[Pixel density|display density]] setting, although this was initially only accessible through a third-party app as the setting was hidden by the system. An update to the [[Samsung Galaxy S7|Galaxy S7]] and S7 Edge made it official, allowing users to change it under the display settings.\n\nTouchWiz 6.0 also includes Google's additions to Android: Doze and App Standby to improve battery performance (although Samsung's own app optimization feature remains available, thus meaning there are two separate \"app optimization\" settings: one within the Smart Manager app, and the other within the battery usage screen), Now on Tap to quickly access the [[intelligent personal assistant]] [[Google Now]], and Permission Control to limit the permissions granted to a particular application.\n\n===TouchWiz Grace UX===\n{{main|Samsung Experience}}\n\nFirst released with the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 7]] for [[Android Marshmallow]], the Grace UX was named after the device's codename, and eventually made its way to older devices, including the Galaxy Note 5 through an update, the [[Samsung Galaxy S7|Galaxy S7]] and S7 Edge through the official [[Android Nougat]] update. The Grace UX features a cleaner, flatter look to iconography and extensive use of white space. TouchWiz Grace UX devices also benefit from the Secure Folder functionality, which enables users to keep certain data, and even apps, behind a secure password.\n\nIn addition, for most countries, all the languages that were absent from previous versions ([[Android Marshmallow]] or earlier) will be available in this release, starting with the [[Samsung Galaxy Tab S3|Galaxy Tab S3]].\n\n==Phones

The film is loosely based on the [[Howl's Moving Castle|1986 novel of the same name]] by British author [[Diana Wynne Jones]]. The film was produced by [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], animated by [[Studio Ghibli]] and distributed by [[Toho]]. The Japanese voice cast featured [[Chieko Baisho]] and [[Takuya Kimura]], while the version dubbed in English starred [[Jean Simmons]], [[Emily Mortimer]], [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Christian Bale]] and [[Billy Crystal]].\n\nThe story is set in a fictional kingdom where both magic and early 20th-century technology are prevalent, against the backdrop of a war with another kingdom. The film tells the story of a young, content milliner named Sophie who is turned into an old woman by a witch who enters her shop and curses her. She encounters a wizard named Howl, and gets caught up in his resistance to fighting for the king.\n\nInfluenced by Miyazaki's opposition to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|United States' invasion of Iraq]] in 2003, the film contains strong [[Pacifism|anti-war]] themes. Miyazaki stated that he \"had a great deal of rage about [the Iraq war],\" which led him to make a film which he felt would be poorly received in the US.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} It also explores the theme of [[old age]], depicting age positively as something which grants the protagonist freedom. The film contains [[Feminism|feminist]] elements as well, and carries messages about the value of [[compassion]].\n\nIn 2013, Miyazaki said the film was his favorite creation, explaining \"I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} The movie is thematically significantly different from the book; while the book focuses on challenging class and gender norms, the film focuses on love, and personal loyalty and the destructive effects of war.{{sfn|Levi|2008}}\n\n''Howl's Moving Castle'' had its [[Film premiere|world premiere]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on 5 September 2004, and was theatrically released in Japan on 20 November 2004. It went on to gross $190 million in Japan and $236 million worldwide, making it one of the most financially successful Japanese films in history. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for its visuals and Miyazaki's presentation of the themes. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', in 2006, and won several other awards, including four [[Tokyo Anime Award]]s and a [[Nebula Award for Best Script]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nSophie, a young [[milliner]], encounters a wizard named Howl on her way to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning home, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a ninety-year-old woman. Seeking to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the countryside. She meets a living scarecrow, whom she calls \"Turnip Head\". He leads her to Howl's moving castle, where she enters without invitation. She subsequently meets Howl's young apprentice Markl and a fire demon named Calcifer, who is the source of the castle's magic and movement. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that she has \"hired herself\" as a cleaning lady.\n\nMeanwhile, Sophie's nation is caught up in a war with a neighboring kingdom, who is searching for their missing prince. The King summons Howl to fight in the war. However, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King (under the pretense of being his mother) to tell him that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives Sophie a charmed ring that leads her to Calcifer and guarantees her safety. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's advisor, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power, turning her into a harmless old woman. Suliman warns Sophie that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight and so Howl arrives to rescue Sophie. Suliman tries to trap him, but with Sophie's help they escape along with the former Witch of The Waste and Suliman's dog Heen.\n\nSophie learns that Howl's life is somehow bound to Calcifer's and that Howl has been transforming into a bird-like creature to interfere with both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Howl then has the castle magically-linked to Sophie's home, parking the castle itself on the town's outskirts. A few days later, the town is bombed by enemy aircraft and Suliman's henchmen attack the house and Sophie's hat shop. Howl heads out to protect the group. Sophie then moves everyone out of the house and removes Calcifer from the fireplace, which collapses the castle. The Witch of The Waste realizes that Calcifer has Howl's heart and grabs the fire demon, setting herself on fire. Sophie panics and pours water onto the Witch, which douses Calcifer. The castle then splits in two; Sophie falls down a chasm and is separated from the group.\n\nFollowing the charmed ring, Sophie wanders into a scene from the past, where she sees a young Howl catch a falling star \u2013 Calcifer \u2013 and give him his heart. Sophie calls for them to find her in the future as she is teleported away. She returns to the present, finds Howl, and they reunite with the others. The Witch returns Howl's heart, and Sophie places it back inside Howl, reviving him and freeing Calcifer, though he decides to stay. Sophie's curse is broken, though her hair remains white. After she kisses Turnip Head on the cheek, he returns to human form, revealing himself to be Justin, the missing prince from the enemy kingdom, who promptly heads for home. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, decides to end the war. As the bombers fly away, Sophie, Howl and the others travel high in the air in a new flying castle.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Chieko Baish\u014d at the Tokyo International Film Festival 2019 (49013476248) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Chieko Baisho]], who voiced Sophie in the Japanese version of the film]]\n[[File:Emily Mortimer 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Picture of Emily Mortimer dressed in white against a green background|[[Emily Mortimer]], who voiced the young Sophie in the version of the film dubbed into English]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

So [he] felt some hesitation about the award.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} Miyazaki identifies as a [[pacifist]].{{sfn|Gordon|2005}}{{sfn|Smith|2011}}{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} On the eve of the Iraq War, Miyazaki decided to make a film that he felt would be poorly received in the [[United States]]. Despite the film's success in that country, literary scholar Dani Cavallaro stated that Miyazaki was able to \"create a film which ought, in principle, to have caused a certain unease among American audiences.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} In the movie, Madame Suliman appears to have only sadistic motivations for creating conflict,{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} and despite being [[omniscient]], is unable to recognize the idiocy of the war until the very end of the story. This reflects Miyazaki's desire to show real-world conflicts as also being somewhat arbitrary and fueled by the desires of capricious people.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|p=8}} Cavallaro stated that the depiction of the war carried \"an unmistakable bitter taste.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}}\n\nThe universe of ''Howl's Moving Castle'' is depicted as not having clear-cut villains and heroes; instead, the characters are complex, and even those that are initially portrayed in a negative light, such as Howl, are shown as capable of change.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Matt Kimmich has stated, however, that the simplistic message of the film is that \"war is bad.\"{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} A scene where Sophie is standing in a beautiful field of flowers is interrupted by a war machine, \"a finger accusing empire as the destroyer of peace.\"{{sfn|Lioi|2010}} This portrayal is in strong contrast to other Miyazaki films like ''Princess Mononoke'', which criticizes military conflict in a more nuanced manner.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} Andrew Osmond stated that \"Howl's pure-hearted anti-war stance is presented as nihilism with no alternative as he fights forces from each side and becomes the worst terror of all,\" in the form of the monstrous bird. By transforming into the bird, Howl risks losing his own humanity; Calcifer comments at one point that he will soon not be able to return to human form.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} In contrast, Ashitaka in ''Princess Mononoke'' fights the demonic sickness with which he is afflicted, and tries to negotiate a peace between the two sides.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} Osmond states that both films also point out the limits of [[masculinity]], as exemplified by Howl and Ashitaka.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\n===Flight and critique of modernity===\nLike several other Miyazaki films,{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} ''Howl's Moving Castle'' reflects the director's love of [[flight|flying]].{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Sequences in the film include both several aircraft of inventive design, as well as Howl transforming into a bird.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Miyazaki examines flight as a theme most directly in the later film ''[[The Wind Rises]]''.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Miyazaki stated that he was attracted to military aircraft as a child, but that he grew to detest them because of the destructive purpose for which they are created.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Thus ''Howl's Moving Castle'' contains images both of aircraft shown as harmless and beautiful, and large military craft depicted as ugly and destructive.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Cavallaro writes that Miyazaki wants to \"portray flight as an object of admiration and awe,\" but that he is not \"[blind] to its abuse by unscrupulous strategists and rulers.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}}\n\nThe nuanced view of flight is part of Miyazaki's broader critique of modern society and technology. Margaret Talbot writes that in person, Miyazaki exhibits \"a profound dissatisfaction with modern life,\"{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} particularly with the effects of technology and a disconnection from nature.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Many of his films depict technological hubris as among the roots of evil.{{sfn|Scott|2005a}} The battleships which are seen moving over the landscape are depicted as \"gleaming with modernity and parading righteousness,\"{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} but are then shown to be highly destructive.{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} In contrast, the semi-organic castle demonstrates \"Miyazaki\u2019s Taoist presentation of industrialism needing to be aligned with nature\" according to Carl and Garrath Wilson.{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} Antonio Lioi writes that Miyazaki often depicts beautiful scenes in contrast to those containing symbols of modernity, such as the scene where Sophie's reverie is interrupted by a war machine. This contrast is part of an [[Ecology|ecological]] criticism of modernity, but Miyazaki also offers an alternative, in the form of beautiful natural scenery.{{sfn|Lioi|2010}}\n\n===Old age and compassion===\nMiyazaki stated that an attractive aspect of the story of ''Howl's Moving Castle'' was the relatively positive light it shed on growing old.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} When Sophie becomes old as a result of the witch's spell, she also feels more able to speak her mind. According to Miyazaki, old women are only infrequently allowed to dominate the screen as in ''Howl's Moving Castle'', which made it a risky concept.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Elizabeth Parsons stated that the film disrupts the stereotype of \"aged unattractiveness,\" when the artificially aged Sophie manages to rescue two attractive men (who come to love her) and to unintentionally end the war in her country.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Sophie's actions are those usually associated with grandmothers, such as being kind and nurturing to those around her, and engaging in housework; however, these actions are depicted as being powerful and heroic.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Sophie is one of several strong female protagonists in Miyazaki's films.{{sfn|Lioi|2010}} According to Parsons, this gives the film a feminist aspect as well.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Additionally, even though Sophie manages to make her presence in the castle legitimate by claiming to be a cleaning lady, the film goes on to show that the housework is equitably distributed, strengthening its feminist aspect.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}}\n\nIn 2013, Miyazaki stated that ''Howl's Moving Castle'' was his favorite creation, and explained his choice by saying \"I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} In the film, Sophie is shown to overcome extreme challenges by learning to put the well-being of those she cares about above her own self-interest, a quality which Miyazaki refers to as devotion.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Several of the protagonists in Miyazaki's films, such as Ashitaka and San in ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' and Sheeta and Pazu in ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' learn to survive by learning the same lesson.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Cavallaro states that Miyazaki spreads this moral through the entire film, to convey human beings' ability to be compassionate, such as when the scarecrow holds an umbrella over Sophie's head when it rains.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Over the course of the film, Howl, its most vain and selfish character, also learns to put others before himself.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} When Madame Suliman returns the Witch of the Waste to her true form as a decrepit old woman, Sophie takes her in and cares for her, despite the witch being responsible for Sophie's curse, thus strongly demonstrating the idea of compassion.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} The witch then nearly destroys Howl through her selfish behavior, but also helps save the castle at the end. Parsons writes that \"In Miyazaki's balancing act, old women can be powerful and weak, positive and negative, nurturing and selfish, maligned and loved; in short, they can not be simply categorized or stereotyped, and they can not be dismissed as fantasy malefactors embodied by evil witches.\"{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} They are also given a lot of space in the film as active characters, something not commonly found in western movies.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = \n| width     = 220\n| image1    = HayaoMiyazakiCCJuly09.jpg\n|alt1            = Picture of Miyazaki holding a microphone \n| caption1  = Director and screenwriter [[Hayao Miyazaki]] in 2009\n| image2    = Toshio Suzuki, Howl's Moving Castle premiere.jpg\n|alt2            = refer to caption\n| caption2  = [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], who produced the film, at its premiere\n}}\nIn September 2001, Studio Ghibli announced the production of two films.

Therefore, the studio chose to manually retouch the digitally altered images, recreating the \"feel\" of a hand-drawn image.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|p=137}}\n\nLike with the other Studio Ghibli movies, the film was co-produced with other companies, which were [[Tokuma Shoten]], the [[Nippon Television Network]], [[Dentsu]], [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]], [[Mitsubishi Corporation|Mitsubishi]] and [[Toho]].<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Rooney|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/awards/howl-s-moving-castle-1200531227/|title=Howl's Moving Castle|work=Variety|date=8 September 2004|accessdate=5 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305202742/http://variety.com/2004/film/awards/howl-s-moving-castle-1200531227/|archive-date=5 March 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Comparisons between film and novel==\nThe film has several differences from the novel, partly due to the different requirements of the two media. [[Diana Wynne Jones]]' novel has a very large cast of characters, and several plot threads that were too complex to be transferred into the film.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=127}} As a result, characters such as Sophie's second sister Martha are left out, as is the plot thread involving Markl (who is called Michael in the novel, and depicted as an adolescent, rather than as a young boy) courting her.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Jones discussed the film with [[Studio Ghibli]] representatives, but did not have any input or involvement in the production of the film. Miyazaki traveled to England in the summer of 2004 to give Jones a private viewing of the finished film. She has been quoted as saying \"It's fantastic. No, I have no input\u2014I write books, not films. Yes, it will be ''different'' from the book\u2014in fact it's likely to be very different, but that's as it should be. It will still be a fantastic film.\"{{sfn|nausicaa1|2016}}\n\nThe novel depicts Howl's castle as a tall, dark and sinister wizard's tower, very different from the complex image in the film. The film's castle may be seen as a parody of the machines seen in the movie, driven both by steam-engines and by magic. In the film, it is a \"rotund collage of chimneys, roofs, steam pipes, and other odd appendages, borne along on mechanized bird legs\"{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} that is similar to [[Baba Yaga]]'s hut in the popular fairy tale. It is vaguely organic, and almost depicted as a life-form.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Similarly, Calcifer is a demonic figure in the book, as compared to the \"endearing\" persona and image that he has in the film.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Both film and novel try to render fantastic elements as mundane and ordinary things. Although they are set in a [[fantasy]] universe, the characters are often shown performing routine tasks, like cooking breakfast or washing up, in contrast to the heroic actions typical of a fantasy universe.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=129}} In the novel, Jones disrupts the fantasy-world setting by including scenes in which the characters travel to the real-world [[Wales]]. The movie, however, avoids this digression, and maintains a constant setting.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\nMiyazaki's biggest addition to the plot of the book was the use of the war as a large part of the plot. In the book, the war is only tangentially referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as a superficial and cowardly person.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In the film, however, Howl disappears from the scene in order to transform into a giant bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}}\n\nThe roles of several characters also differ between novel and film due to this plot change. The Witch of the Waste is the chief antagonist of the book, whereas in the film she is reduced by Madame Suliman's magic to an ultimately harmless old woman who evokes sympathy in the audience and in Sophie.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In contrast, the film conflates the novel's two characters of Mrs. Penstemmon and the wizard Suliman into Madame Suliman. Although Suliman comes closest to being a traditional villain in the film, she is shown as having ambiguous motivations, and reviewers have stated that the real villain is war itself.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} Howl loses the \"rakish\" womanizing aspect that was a significant part of his character in the novel.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In contrast, Sophie becomes a more conventional figure in the film; she is less grumpy and outspoken, and demonstrates her love for Howl earlier and more explicitly.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} The storyline in the novel of Sophie being a powerful sorceress in her own right is muted in the film, although she is still shown to have control over her curse.{{sfn|Levi|2008}}\n\nThe thematic focus of the story also differs between the novel and the film. Reviewer Antonia Levi wrote that the experience of watching the film was similar to reading high quality [[fan fiction]]; although the characters and the setting were the same, the story was different.{{sfn|Levi|2008}} Although in both cases the story begins with Sophie being a prisoner of her circumstances and of social norms, the challenges she faces are slightly different.

Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"Admirers of [Hayao Miyazaki's] work, which is wildly imaginative, emotionally intense and surpassingly gentle, will find much to appreciate in this film because it demonstrates, once again, his visual ingenuity and his sensitivity as a storyteller.

The film is loosely based on the [[Howl's Moving Castle|1986 novel of the same name]] by British author [[Diana Wynne Jones]]. The film was produced by [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], animated by [[Studio Ghibli]] and distributed by [[Toho]]. The Japanese voice cast featured [[Chieko Baisho]] and [[Takuya Kimura]], while the version dubbed in English starred [[Jean Simmons]], [[Emily Mortimer]], [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Christian Bale]] and [[Billy Crystal]].\n\nThe story is set in a fictional kingdom where both magic and early 20th-century technology are prevalent, against the backdrop of a war with another kingdom. The film tells the story of a young, content milliner named Sophie who is turned into an old woman by a witch who enters her shop and curses her. She encounters a wizard named Howl, and gets caught up in his resistance to fighting for the king.\n\nInfluenced by Miyazaki's opposition to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|United States' invasion of Iraq]] in 2003, the film contains strong [[Pacifism|anti-war]] themes. Miyazaki stated that he \"had a great deal of rage about [the Iraq war],\" which led him to make a film which he felt would be poorly received in the US.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} It also explores the theme of [[old age]], depicting age positively as something which grants the protagonist freedom. The film contains [[Feminism|feminist]] elements as well, and carries messages about the value of [[compassion]].\n\nIn 2013, Miyazaki said the film was his favorite creation, explaining \"I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} The movie is thematically significantly different from the book; while the book focuses on challenging class and gender norms, the film focuses on love, and personal loyalty and the destructive effects of war.{{sfn|Levi|2008}}\n\n''Howl's Moving Castle'' had its [[Film premiere|world premiere]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on 5 September 2004, and was theatrically released in Japan on 20 November 2004. It went on to gross $190 million in Japan and $236 million worldwide, making it one of the most financially successful Japanese films in history. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for its visuals and Miyazaki's presentation of the themes. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', in 2006, and won several other awards, including four [[Tokyo Anime Award]]s and a [[Nebula Award for Best Script]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nSophie, a young [[milliner]], encounters a wizard named Howl on her way to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning home, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a ninety-year-old woman. Seeking to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the countryside. She meets a living scarecrow, whom she calls \"Turnip Head\". He leads her to Howl's moving castle, where she enters without invitation. She subsequently meets Howl's young apprentice Markl and a fire demon named Calcifer, who is the source of the castle's magic and movement. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that she has \"hired herself\" as a cleaning lady.\n\nMeanwhile, Sophie's nation is caught up in a war with a neighboring kingdom, who is searching for their missing prince. The King summons Howl to fight in the war. However, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King (under the pretense of being his mother) to tell him that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives Sophie a charmed ring that leads her to Calcifer and guarantees her safety. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's advisor, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power, turning her into a harmless old woman. Suliman warns Sophie that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight and so Howl arrives to rescue Sophie. Suliman tries to trap him, but with Sophie's help they escape along with the former Witch of The Waste and Suliman's dog Heen.\n\nSophie learns that Howl's life is somehow bound to Calcifer's and that Howl has been transforming into a bird-like creature to interfere with both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Howl then has the castle magically-linked to Sophie's home, parking the castle itself on the town's outskirts. A few days later, the town is bombed by enemy aircraft and Suliman's henchmen attack the house and Sophie's hat shop. Howl heads out to protect the group. Sophie then moves everyone out of the house and removes Calcifer from the fireplace, which collapses the castle. The Witch of The Waste realizes that Calcifer has Howl's heart and grabs the fire demon, setting herself on fire. Sophie panics and pours water onto the Witch, which douses Calcifer. The castle then splits in two; Sophie falls down a chasm and is separated from the group.\n\nFollowing the charmed ring, Sophie wanders into a scene from the past, where she sees a young Howl catch a falling star \u2013 Calcifer \u2013 and give him his heart. Sophie calls for them to find her in the future as she is teleported away. She returns to the present, finds Howl, and they reunite with the others. The Witch returns Howl's heart, and Sophie places it back inside Howl, reviving him and freeing Calcifer, though he decides to stay. Sophie's curse is broken, though her hair remains white. After she kisses Turnip Head on the cheek, he returns to human form, revealing himself to be Justin, the missing prince from the enemy kingdom, who promptly heads for home. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, decides to end the war. As the bombers fly away, Sophie, Howl and the others travel high in the air in a new flying castle.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Chieko Baish\u014d at the Tokyo International Film Festival 2019 (49013476248) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Chieko Baisho]], who voiced Sophie in the Japanese version of the film]]\n[[File:Emily Mortimer 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Picture of Emily Mortimer dressed in white against a green background|[[Emily Mortimer]], who voiced the young Sophie in the version of the film dubbed into English]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

So [he] felt some hesitation about the award.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} Miyazaki identifies as a [[pacifist]].{{sfn|Gordon|2005}}{{sfn|Smith|2011}}{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} On the eve of the Iraq War, Miyazaki decided to make a film that he felt would be poorly received in the [[United States]]. Despite the film's success in that country, literary scholar Dani Cavallaro stated that Miyazaki was able to \"create a film which ought, in principle, to have caused a certain unease among American audiences.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} In the movie, Madame Suliman appears to have only sadistic motivations for creating conflict,{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} and despite being [[omniscient]], is unable to recognize the idiocy of the war until the very end of the story. This reflects Miyazaki's desire to show real-world conflicts as also being somewhat arbitrary and fueled by the desires of capricious people.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|p=8}} Cavallaro stated that the depiction of the war carried \"an unmistakable bitter taste.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}}\n\nThe universe of ''Howl's Moving Castle'' is depicted as not having clear-cut villains and heroes; instead, the characters are complex, and even those that are initially portrayed in a negative light, such as Howl, are shown as capable of change.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Matt Kimmich has stated, however, that the simplistic message of the film is that \"war is bad.\"{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} A scene where Sophie is standing in a beautiful field of flowers is interrupted by a war machine, \"a finger accusing empire as the destroyer of peace.\"{{sfn|Lioi|2010}} This portrayal is in strong contrast to other Miyazaki films like ''Princess Mononoke'', which criticizes military conflict in a more nuanced manner.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} Andrew Osmond stated that \"Howl's pure-hearted anti-war stance is presented as nihilism with no alternative as he fights forces from each side and becomes the worst terror of all,\" in the form of the monstrous bird. By transforming into the bird, Howl risks losing his own humanity; Calcifer comments at one point that he will soon not be able to return to human form.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} In contrast, Ashitaka in ''Princess Mononoke'' fights the demonic sickness with which he is afflicted, and tries to negotiate a peace between the two sides.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} Osmond states that both films also point out the limits of [[masculinity]], as exemplified by Howl and Ashitaka.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\n===Flight and critique of modernity===\nLike several other Miyazaki films,{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} ''Howl's Moving Castle'' reflects the director's love of [[flight|flying]].{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Sequences in the film include both several aircraft of inventive design, as well as Howl transforming into a bird.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Miyazaki examines flight as a theme most directly in the later film ''[[The Wind Rises]]''.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Miyazaki stated that he was attracted to military aircraft as a child, but that he grew to detest them because of the destructive purpose for which they are created.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Thus ''Howl's Moving Castle'' contains images both of aircraft shown as harmless and beautiful, and large military craft depicted as ugly and destructive.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Cavallaro writes that Miyazaki wants to \"portray flight as an object of admiration and awe,\" but that he is not \"[blind] to its abuse by unscrupulous strategists and rulers.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}}\n\nThe nuanced view of flight is part of Miyazaki's broader critique of modern society and technology. Margaret Talbot writes that in person, Miyazaki exhibits \"a profound dissatisfaction with modern life,\"{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} particularly with the effects of technology and a disconnection from nature.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Many of his films depict technological hubris as among the roots of evil.{{sfn|Scott|2005a}} The battleships which are seen moving over the landscape are depicted as \"gleaming with modernity and parading righteousness,\"{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} but are then shown to be highly destructive.{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} In contrast, the semi-organic castle demonstrates \"Miyazaki\u2019s Taoist presentation of industrialism needing to be aligned with nature\" according to Carl and Garrath Wilson.{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} Antonio Lioi writes that Miyazaki often depicts beautiful scenes in contrast to those containing symbols of modernity, such as the scene where Sophie's reverie is interrupted by a war machine. This contrast is part of an [[Ecology|ecological]] criticism of modernity, but Miyazaki also offers an alternative, in the form of beautiful natural scenery.{{sfn|Lioi|2010}}\n\n===Old age and compassion===\nMiyazaki stated that an attractive aspect of the story of ''Howl's Moving Castle'' was the relatively positive light it shed on growing old.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} When Sophie becomes old as a result of the witch's spell, she also feels more able to speak her mind. According to Miyazaki, old women are only infrequently allowed to dominate the screen as in ''Howl's Moving Castle'', which made it a risky concept.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Elizabeth Parsons stated that the film disrupts the stereotype of \"aged unattractiveness,\" when the artificially aged Sophie manages to rescue two attractive men (who come to love her) and to unintentionally end the war in her country.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Sophie's actions are those usually associated with grandmothers, such as being kind and nurturing to those around her, and engaging in housework; however, these actions are depicted as being powerful and heroic.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Sophie is one of several strong female protagonists in Miyazaki's films.{{sfn|Lioi|2010}} According to Parsons, this gives the film a feminist aspect as well.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Additionally, even though Sophie manages to make her presence in the castle legitimate by claiming to be a cleaning lady, the film goes on to show that the housework is equitably distributed, strengthening its feminist aspect.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}}\n\nIn 2013, Miyazaki stated that ''Howl's Moving Castle'' was his favorite creation, and explained his choice by saying \"I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} In the film, Sophie is shown to overcome extreme challenges by learning to put the well-being of those she cares about above her own self-interest, a quality which Miyazaki refers to as devotion.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Several of the protagonists in Miyazaki's films, such as Ashitaka and San in ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' and Sheeta and Pazu in ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' learn to survive by learning the same lesson.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Cavallaro states that Miyazaki spreads this moral through the entire film, to convey human beings' ability to be compassionate, such as when the scarecrow holds an umbrella over Sophie's head when it rains.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Over the course of the film, Howl, its most vain and selfish character, also learns to put others before himself.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} When Madame Suliman returns the Witch of the Waste to her true form as a decrepit old woman, Sophie takes her in and cares for her, despite the witch being responsible for Sophie's curse, thus strongly demonstrating the idea of compassion.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} The witch then nearly destroys Howl through her selfish behavior, but also helps save the castle at the end.

Therefore, the studio chose to manually retouch the digitally altered images, recreating the \"feel\" of a hand-drawn image.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|p=137}}\n\nLike with the other Studio Ghibli movies, the film was co-produced with other companies, which were [[Tokuma Shoten]], the [[Nippon Television Network]], [[Dentsu]], [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]], [[Mitsubishi Corporation|Mitsubishi]] and [[Toho]].<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Rooney|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/awards/howl-s-moving-castle-1200531227/|title=Howl's Moving Castle|work=Variety|date=8 September 2004|accessdate=5 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305202742/http://variety.com/2004/film/awards/howl-s-moving-castle-1200531227/|archive-date=5 March 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Comparisons between film and novel==\nThe film has several differences from the novel, partly due to the different requirements of the two media. [[Diana Wynne Jones]]' novel has a very large cast of characters, and several plot threads that were too complex to be transferred into the film.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=127}} As a result, characters such as Sophie's second sister Martha are left out, as is the plot thread involving Markl (who is called Michael in the novel, and depicted as an adolescent, rather than as a young boy) courting her.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Jones discussed the film with [[Studio Ghibli]] representatives, but did not have any input or involvement in the production of the film. Miyazaki traveled to England in the summer of 2004 to give Jones a private viewing of the finished film. She has been quoted as saying \"It's fantastic. No, I have no input\u2014I write books, not films. Yes, it will be ''different'' from the book\u2014in fact it's likely to be very different, but that's as it should be. It will still be a fantastic film.\"{{sfn|nausicaa1|2016}}\n\nThe novel depicts Howl's castle as a tall, dark and sinister wizard's tower, very different from the complex image in the film. The film's castle may be seen as a parody of the machines seen in the movie, driven both by steam-engines and by magic. In the film, it is a \"rotund collage of chimneys, roofs, steam pipes, and other odd appendages, borne along on mechanized bird legs\"{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} that is similar to [[Baba Yaga]]'s hut in the popular fairy tale. It is vaguely organic, and almost depicted as a life-form.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Similarly, Calcifer is a demonic figure in the book, as compared to the \"endearing\" persona and image that he has in the film.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Both film and novel try to render fantastic elements as mundane and ordinary things. Although they are set in a [[fantasy]] universe, the characters are often shown performing routine tasks, like cooking breakfast or washing up, in contrast to the heroic actions typical of a fantasy universe.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=129}} In the novel, Jones disrupts the fantasy-world setting by including scenes in which the characters travel to the real-world [[Wales]]. The movie, however, avoids this digression, and maintains a constant setting.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\nMiyazaki's biggest addition to the plot of the book was the use of the war as a large part of the plot. In the book, the war is only tangentially referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as a superficial and cowardly person.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In the film, however, Howl disappears from the scene in order to transform into a giant bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}}\n\nThe roles of several characters also differ between novel and film due to this plot change. The Witch of the Waste is the chief antagonist of the book, whereas in the film she is reduced by Madame Suliman's magic to an ultimately harmless old woman who evokes sympathy in the audience and in Sophie.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In contrast, the film conflates the novel's two characters of Mrs. Penstemmon and the wizard Suliman into Madame Suliman. Although Suliman comes closest to being a traditional villain in the film, she is shown as having ambiguous motivations, and reviewers have stated that the real villain is war itself.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} Howl loses the \"rakish\" womanizing aspect that was a significant part of his character in the novel.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In contrast, Sophie becomes a more conventional figure in the film; she is less grumpy and outspoken, and demonstrates her love for Howl earlier and more explicitly.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} The storyline in the novel of Sophie being a powerful sorceress in her own right is muted in the film, although she is still shown to have control over her curse.{{sfn|Levi|2008}}\n\nThe thematic focus of the story also differs between the novel and the film. Reviewer Antonia Levi wrote that the experience of watching the film was similar to reading high quality [[fan fiction]]; although the characters and the setting were the same, the story was different.{{sfn|Levi|2008}} Although in both cases the story begins with Sophie being a prisoner of her circumstances and of social norms, the challenges she faces are slightly different. Levi said that \"Jones uses Sophie, Howl, and Calcifer in a fairytale format to tell a story about challenging class and gender expectations, Miyazaki uses the same characters to tell a story about personal loyalty, love, and war.\"{{sfn|Levi|2008}}\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Joe Hisaishi 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Hisaishi]], who composed and conducted the score, in 2011]]\nThe score was composed and conducted by [[Joe Hisaishi]], and performed by the [[New Japan Philharmonic]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/other/12911/music-in-the-movies-joe-hisaishi|title=Music in the movies: Joe Hisaishi|work=Den of Geek|access-date=14 December 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215001607/http://www.denofgeek.com/other/12911/music-in-the-movies-joe-hisaishi|archive-date=15 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Film soundtrack|soundtrack CD]] was first released on 19 November 2004 by Tokuma Japan Communications.

At its worst, it's the most amazing 12-course meal you can't bring yourself to finish.\"{{sfn|Burr|2005}} [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"Admirers of [Hayao Miyazaki's] work, which is wildly imaginative, emotionally intense and surpassingly gentle, will find much to appreciate in this film because it demonstrates, once again, his visual ingenuity and his sensitivity as a storyteller. For newcomers to his world, \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a fitting introduction to one of modern cinema's great enchanters.\"{{sfn|Scott|2005b}}\n\nConversely, [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film two and a half out of four stars, and called it a \"disappointment\" compared to other Miyazaki's recent movies.{{sfn|Ebert|2005}} Jonathan Trout of the [[BBC]] said, \"Youngsters and Miyazaki fans will coo at the world's depth and rich surreality, but opaque plotting, and a tendency to mope with Sophie whilst Howl is off affecting events let the momentum of the first act vanish into thin air.\"{{sfn|Trout|2005}} Writing for ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', [[Stephanie Zacharek]] said, \"the plot of \"Howl's Moving Castle\" meanders so listlessly that its details become less and less charming.

It was built on the site of the two previous M\u00fcngersdorfer stadiums. It is the home of the local [[Bundesliga]] team, [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]]. The stadium was one of 5 stadiums hosting both the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. Local energy company [[RheinEnergie AG]] currently holds the naming rights to the stadium.\n\n==History==\nUnder the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919), the fortifications of [[Cologne]] were removed, thus allowing for the building of a new structure in the surrounding area. The new construction enabled the city to create 15,000 jobs. The new stadium was called the '''M\u00fcngersdorfer Stadion'''. This allowed Cologne not only to help stabilize the country but also to gain prestige and economic benefits for the city. The cost was tallied at 47.4 million [[Deutsche Mark]].\n\nFollowing the completion of the stadium the city began to gain prominence in the domestic sports world. Many major football matches were held at the stadium in front of huge crowds. The first international match was held on 20 November 1927, when the [[Germany national football team|German national football team]] drew 2\u20132 with [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]]. Since then, the German team has played 19 times at the stadium, and only one of those matches resulted in a loss. Another notable match was the first post-war game, which saw [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]] beat [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]] 2\u20131, in front of a crowd of 75,000.\n\nOne of the specialties of the M\u00fcngersdorfer Stadion was the track meets for non-professional sportsmen. In 1929 there were over 38,000 participants. However, in 1933 Jews were no longer allowed to take part. After the war the stadium has only hosted professional level sports.\n\n==Recent matches of importance==\nIn 2005, the stadium was a venue for three first-round games of the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup|FIFA Confederations Cup]], including the opening match between [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]]. The game was won by Argentina 2\u20131.\n\nThe M\u00fcngersdorfer has been host to many important [[UEFA Cup]] matches. [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] played against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], and [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] against [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] in the [[1988\u201389 European Cup]]. [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]] played both [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and AS Monaco in the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup]]. The stadium also functioned as the home ground to second-tier [[Alemannia Aachen]] in their 2004\u201305 UEFA Cup campaign.\n\n==Awards==\nIn July 2004, the RheinEnergieStadion was awarded a bronze medal for distinguished sporting and leisure facilities by the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n==Renovation==\n[[File:RheinEnergieStadion K\u00f6ln 002.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Outside the stadium]]\nThere have been two renovations, first from 1972 to 1975 and once more from 2002 to 2004.\n\nIn 1974, the World Cup was held in [[West Germany]], and [[Cologne]] had wanted to be a host city. The city's bid was approved and it soon began work on a new stadium that was to replace the now outdated M\u00fcngersdorfer Stadion. However, the city was unable to raise the money needed for a stadium of the desired size. The original plan was for an 80,000-seat arena, which was planned to have cost 23.5 million Deutsche Mark. But the total kept growing. In the end, if the stadium had been completed, the cost would have amounted to 93.5 million. At the time, the city was able to provide only an extra 6 million Deutsche Mark.\n\nFollowing the World Cup, Cologne still wanted the stadium completed. Hence, on 12 November 1975, a 61,000-seat arena was inaugurated with a match between [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]] and [[SC Fortuna K\u00f6ln]], 1. FC K\u00f6ln winning 1\u20130.\n\nWith the news of the prospect of bringing the World Cup back to Germany, the city reacted and started renovation of the stadium, which was completed in 2003. Unlike previous configurations, there are no track-and-field facilities, allowing spectators to be much closer to the pitch than they might have been in a traditional continental [[multi-purpose stadium]]. Thus, the stadium was designed like English-style football stadia, e.g., Anfield, Stamford Bridge, Villa Park and White Hart Lane, with spectators almost on top of the pitch and players.\n\n==Facilities==\nThe [[List of association football stadiums by capacity|capacity]] is about 50,000 people during club matches and 45,965 for international games, when [[Terrace (stadium)|terracing]] is not allowed. The entire field is lit with a floodlight system. In the north grandstand there is a museum dedicated to [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]].\n\n==External dimensions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Length'''||220 m\n|-\n| '''Width'''||180 m\n|-\n| '''Height to Roof'''||33.25 m\n|-\n| '''Roof Area'''||15,400 m\u00b2\n|}\n\n== 2006 FIFA World Cup ==\nThe stadium was one of the venues for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. However, due to sponsorship contracts, the arena was called \"FIFA World Cup Stadium Cologne\" during the World Cup.\n\nThe following games were played at the stadium during the World Cup of 2006:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Time ([[Central European Time|CET]])\n!Team #\n!Res.\n!Team #2\n!Round\n!Attendance\n|-\n|11 June 2006||21:00||{{fb|ANG}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20131||{{fb|POR}}||[[2006 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|45,000\n|-\n|17 June 2006||17:00||{{fb|CZE}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20132||{{fb|GHA}}||[[2006 FIFA World Cup Group E|Group E]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|45,000\n|-\n|20 June 2006||18:00||{{fb|SWE}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\u20132||{{fb|ENG}}||[[2006 FIFA World Cup Group B|Group B]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|45,000\n|-\n|23 June 2006||20:00||{{fb|TGO}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20132||{{fb|FRA}}||[[2006 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|45,000\n|-\n|26 June 2006||21:00||{{fb|SUI}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20130 (0\u20133p)||{{fb|UKR}}||Round of 16||style=\"text-align:center;\"|45,000\n|}\n[[File:Rheinenergiestadion-panorama.jpg|800px|thumb|center|Panoramic view of the stadium.]]\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe stadion is part of Sportpark M\u00fcngersdorf, adjacent to Aachener Stra\u00dfe.

It was built on the site of the two previous M\u00fcngersdorfer stadiums. It is the home of the local [[Bundesliga]] team, [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]]. The stadium was one of 5 stadiums hosting both the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. Local energy company [[RheinEnergie AG]] currently holds the naming rights to the stadium.\n\n==History==\nUnder the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919), the fortifications of [[Cologne]] were removed, thus allowing for the building of a new structure in the surrounding area. The new construction enabled the city to create 15,000 jobs. The new stadium was called the '''M\u00fcngersdorfer Stadion'''. This allowed Cologne not only to help stabilize the country but also to gain prestige and economic benefits for the city. The cost was tallied at 47.4 million [[Deutsche Mark]].\n\nFollowing the completion of the stadium the city began to gain prominence in the domestic sports world. Many major football matches were held at the stadium in front of huge crowds. The first international match was held on 20 November 1927, when the [[Germany national football team|German national football team]] drew 2\u20132 with [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]]. Since then, the German team has played 19 times at the stadium, and only one of those matches resulted in a loss. Another notable match was the first post-war game, which saw [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]] beat [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]] 2\u20131, in front of a crowd of 75,000.\n\nOne of the specialties of the M\u00fcngersdorfer Stadion was the track meets for non-professional sportsmen. In 1929 there were over 38,000 participants. However, in 1933 Jews were no longer allowed to take part. After the war the stadium has only hosted professional level sports.\n\n==Recent matches of importance==\nIn 2005, the stadium was a venue for three first-round games of the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup|FIFA Confederations Cup]], including the opening match between [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]]. The game was won by Argentina 2\u20131.\n\nThe M\u00fcngersdorfer has been host to many important [[UEFA Cup]] matches. [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] played against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], and [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] against [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] in the [[1988\u201389 European Cup]]. [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]] played both [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and AS Monaco in the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup]]. The stadium also functioned as the home ground to second-tier [[Alemannia Aachen]] in their 2004\u201305 UEFA Cup campaign.\n\n==Awards==\nIn July 2004, the RheinEnergieStadion was awarded a bronze medal for distinguished sporting and leisure facilities by the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n==Renovation==\n[[File:RheinEnergieStadion K\u00f6ln 002.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Outside the stadium]]\nThere have been two renovations, first from 1972 to 1975 and once more from 2002 to 2004.\n\nIn 1974, the World Cup was held in [[West Germany]], and [[Cologne]] had wanted to be a host city. The city's bid was approved and it soon began work on a new stadium that was to replace the now outdated M\u00fcngersdorfer Stadion. However, the city was unable to raise the money needed for a stadium of the desired size. The original plan was for an 80,000-seat arena, which was planned to have cost 23.5 million Deutsche Mark. But the total kept growing. In the end, if the stadium had been completed, the cost would have amounted to 93.5 million. At the time, the city was able to provide only an extra 6 million Deutsche Mark.\n\nFollowing the World Cup, Cologne still wanted the stadium completed. Hence, on 12 November 1975, a 61,000-seat arena was inaugurated with a match between [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]] and [[SC Fortuna K\u00f6ln]], 1. FC K\u00f6ln winning 1\u20130.\n\nWith the news of the prospect of bringing the World Cup back to Germany, the city reacted and started renovation of the stadium, which was completed in 2003. Unlike previous configurations, there are no track-and-field facilities, allowing spectators to be much closer to the pitch than they might have been in a traditional continental [[multi-purpose stadium]]. Thus, the stadium was designed like English-style football stadia, e.g., Anfield, Stamford Bridge, Villa Park and White Hart Lane, with spectators almost on top of the pitch and players.\n\n==Facilities==\nThe [[List of association football stadiums by capacity|capacity]] is about 50,000 people during club matches and 45,965 for international games, when [[Terrace (stadium)|terracing]] is not allowed. The entire field is lit with a floodlight system. In the north grandstand there is a museum dedicated to [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]].\n\n==External dimensions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Length'''||220 m\n|-\n| '''Width'''||180 m\n|-\n| '''Height to Roof'''||33.25 m\n|-\n| '''Roof Area'''||15,400 m\u00b2\n|}\n\n== 2006 FIFA World Cup ==\nThe stadium was one of the venues for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. However, due to sponsorship contracts, the arena was called \"FIFA World Cup Stadium Cologne\" during the World Cup.\n\nThe following games were played at the stadium during the World Cup of 2006:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Time ([[Central European Time|CET]])\n!Team #\n!Res.\n!Team #2\n!Round\n!Attendance\n|-\n|11 June 2006||21:00||{{fb|ANG}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20131||{{fb|POR}}||[[2006 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|45,000\n|-\n|17 June 2006||17:00||{{fb|CZE}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20132||{{fb|GHA}}||[[2006 FIFA World Cup Group E|Group E]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|45,000\n|-\n|20 June 2006||18:00||{{fb|SWE}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\u20132||{{fb|ENG}}||[[2006 FIFA World Cup Group B|Group B]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|45,000\n|-\n|23 June 2006||20:00||{{fb|TGO}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20132||{{fb|FRA}}||[[2006 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|45,000\n|-\n|26 June 2006||21:00||{{fb|SUI}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20130 (0\u20133p)||{{fb|UKR}}||Round of 16||style=\"text-align:center;\"|45,000\n|}\n[[File:Rheinenergiestadion-panorama.jpg|800px|thumb|center|Panoramic view of the stadium.]]\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe stadion is part of Sportpark M\u00fcngersdorf, adjacent to Aachener Stra\u00dfe. It is accessible by car via the [[Cologne Beltway]], only some 1200 m off the [[Bundesautobahn 1]].

romanization|alternately romanized]] as '''Kansu''') is a landlocked [[Provinces of China|province]] in [[Northwest China]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Lanzhou]], located in the southeast part of the province.\n\nThe seventh-largest administrative district by area at {{convert|453700|km2}}, Gansu lies between the [[Tibetan Plateau|Tibetan]] and [[Loess Plateau|Loess]] plateaus and borders [[Mongolia]] ([[Govi-Altai Province]]), [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Ningxia]] to the north, [[Xinjiang]] and [[Qinghai]] to the west, [[Sichuan]] to the south and [[Shaanxi]] to the east. The [[Yellow River]] passes through the southern part of the province. Part of Gansu's territory is located in the [[Gobi Desert]]. The [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] mountains are located in the south of the Province.\n\nGansu has a population of 26 million, ranking [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|22nd in China]]. Its population is mostly [[Han Chinese|Han]], along with [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Dongxiangs|Dongxiang]] and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] minorities. The most common language is Mandarin. Gansu is among the poorest administrative divisions in China, [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|ranking 31st]] in GDP per capita. Most of Gansu's economy is based on the [[mining]] industry and the extraction of [[minerals]], especially [[rare earth elements]].

Jiayuguan Pass was the first pass on the west end of the great wall so it earned the name \"The First And Greatest Pass Under Heaven\".\n\nAn extra brick is said to rest on a ledge over one of the gates.  One legend holds that the official in charge asked the designer to calculate how many bricks would be used. The designer gave him the number and when the project was finished, only one brick was left. It was put on the top of the pass as a symbol of commemoration.  Another account holds that the building project was assigned to a military manager and an architect.  The architect presented the manager with a requisition for the total number of bricks that he would need.  When the manager found out that the architect had not asked for any extra bricks, he demanded that the architect make some provision for unforeseen circumstances.  The architect, taking this as an insult to his planning ability, added a single extra brick to the request.  When the gate was finished, the single extra brick was, in fact, extra and was left on the ledge over the gate.<ref name=\"CNTOLEGEND\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnto.org/iconic/the-great-wall-in-gansu/|title=The Great Wall in Gansu|accessdate=4 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mogao Grottoes===\n{{main|Mogao Caves}}\nThe Mogao Grottoes near [[Dunhuang]] have a collection of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] art.

On the way merchants would go to Dunhuang in Gansu. In Dunhuang they would get fresh camels, food and guards for the journey around the dangerous [[Taklamakan Desert]]. Before departing Dunhuang they would pray to the Mogao Grottoes for a safe journey, if they came back alive they would thank the gods at the grottoes. Across the desert they would form a train of camels to protect themselves from thieving bandits. The next stop, [[Kashgar|Kashi (Kashgar)]], was a welcome sight to the merchants. At Kashi most would trade and go back and the ones who stayed would eat fruit and trade their [[Bactrian camel]]s for [[Dromedary|single humped]] ones.

The [[Yellow River]] passes through the southern part of the province. Part of Gansu's territory is located in the [[Gobi Desert]]. The [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] mountains are located in the south of the Province.\n\nGansu has a population of 26 million, ranking [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|22nd in China]]. Its population is mostly [[Han Chinese|Han]], along with [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Dongxiangs|Dongxiang]] and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] minorities. The most common language is Mandarin. Gansu is among the poorest administrative divisions in China, [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|ranking 31st]] in GDP per capita. Most of Gansu's economy is based on the [[mining]] industry and the extraction of [[minerals]], especially [[rare earth elements]]. Tourism also plays a role in Gansu's economy.\n\nThe [[State of Qin]] originated in what is now southeastern Gansu and went on to form the first known Empire in what is now [[China]].

It lies between the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and the [[Loess Plateau]], bordering [[Mongolia]] ([[Govi-Altai Province]]) to the northwest, [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Ningxia]] to the north, [[Shaanxi]] to the east, [[Sichuan]] to the south, and [[Xinjiang]] to the west. The [[Yellow River]] passes through the southern part of the province. The province contains the [[geographical centre]] of China, marked by the Center of the Country Monument at {{coord|35|50|40.9|N|103|27|7.5|E|region:CN-62_type:landmark|name=Geographical centre of China}}.<ref>[http://en.people.cn/english/200009/13/eng20000913_50419.html English.people.com.cn]</ref>\n\nPart of the [[Gobi Desert]] is located in Gansu, as well as small parts of the [[Badain Jaran Desert]] and the [[Tengger Desert]].\n\nThe [[Yellow River]] gets most of its water from Gansu, flowing straight through Lanzhou. The area around Wuwei is part of [[Shiyang River Basin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurewater.nl/gmep/shiyang/general |accessdate=15 June 2009 |author=FutureWater |title=Groundwater Management Exploration Package |location=# [[Wageningen]], Netherlands |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724152308/http://www.futurewater.nl/gmep/shiyang/general |archivedate=24 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe landscape in Gansu is very mountainous in the south and flat in the north. The mountains in the south are part of the [[Qilian Mountains]], while the far western [[Altyn-Tagh]] contains the province's highest point, at {{convert|5830|m|ft|-1}}.\n\nA natural land passage known as [[Hexi Corridor]], stretching some {{convert|1000|km}} from Lanzhou to the [[Yumen Pass|Jade Gate]], is situated within the province. It is bound from north by the Gobi Desert and Qilian Mountains from the south.\n\nGansu generally has a semi-arid to arid continental climate ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''BSk'' or ''BWk'') with warm to hot summers and cold to very cold winters, although [[diurnal temperature range]]s are often so large that maxima remain above {{convert|0|C|F}} even in winter.  However, due to extreme altitude, some areas of Gansu exhibit a [[subarctic climate]] (''Dwc'') \u2013 with winter temperatures sometimes dropping to {{convert|-40|C|F}}. Most of the limited precipitation is delivered in the summer months: winters are so dry that snow cover is confined to very high altitudes and the [[snow line]] can be as high as {{convert|5500|m|ft|-1}} in the southwest.\n<gallery>\nFile:Crescent Lake (41853077232).jpg|[[Crescent Lake (Dunhuang)|Crescent Lake]], [[Dunhuang]]\nFile:Suzhou, Jiuquan, Gansu, China - panoramio (6).jpg|[[Qilian Mountains]] southeast of [[Jiuquan]]\nFile:\u9e1f\u77b0\u53bb\u9647\u5357\u7684\u516c\u8def - panoramio.jpg|[[Terrace farm]]s near [[Tianshui]]\nFile:\u5cb7\u53bf\u79e6\u8bb8\u4e61.jpg|Grasslands in [[Min County]]\nFile:Southeast Tibet meadows.jpg|Meadows in [[Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Gannan]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n{{main|List of administrative divisions of Gansu|List of township-level divisions of Gansu}}\nGansu is divided into fourteen [[Administrative divisions of China#Prefectural level|prefecture-level divisions]]: twelve [[Prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] and two [[Autonomous prefectures of the People's Republic of China|autonomous prefectures]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto; width:90%; font-size:smaller; text-align:center\"\n!

One legend holds that the official in charge asked the designer to calculate how many bricks would be used. The designer gave him the number and when the project was finished, only one brick was left. It was put on the top of the pass as a symbol of commemoration.  Another account holds that the building project was assigned to a military manager and an architect.  The architect presented the manager with a requisition for the total number of bricks that he would need.  When the manager found out that the architect had not asked for any extra bricks, he demanded that the architect make some provision for unforeseen circumstances.  The architect, taking this as an insult to his planning ability, added a single extra brick to the request.  When the gate was finished, the single extra brick was, in fact, extra and was left on the ledge over the gate.<ref name=\"CNTOLEGEND\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnto.org/iconic/the-great-wall-in-gansu/|title=The Great Wall in Gansu|accessdate=4 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mogao Grottoes===\n{{main|Mogao Caves}}\nThe Mogao Grottoes near [[Dunhuang]] have a collection of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] art. Originally there were a thousand grottoes, but now only 492 cave temples remain. Each temple has a large statue of a [[Buddha (general)|buddha]] or [[bodhisattva]] and paintings of religious scenes. In 336&nbsp;AD, a monk named Le Zun (Lo-tsun) came near Echoing Sand Mountain, when he had a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]. He started to carve the first grotto. During the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Five Dynasties period]] they ran out of room on the cliff and could not build any more grottoes.\n\n===Silk Road and Dunhuang City===\n[[File:Cernuschi Museum 20060812 156.jpg|thumb|200px|A terracotta warrior from Gansu, with traces of polychrome and gold, from the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907)]]\nThe historic [[Silk Road]] starts in [[Chang'an]] and goes to [[Constantinople]]. On the way merchants would go to Dunhuang in Gansu. In Dunhuang they would get fresh camels, food and guards for the journey around the dangerous [[Taklamakan Desert]]. Before departing Dunhuang they would pray to the Mogao Grottoes for a safe journey, if they came back alive they would thank the gods at the grottoes. Across the desert they would form a train of camels to protect themselves from thieving bandits. The next stop, [[Kashgar|Kashi (Kashgar)]], was a welcome sight to the merchants. At Kashi most would trade and go back and the ones who stayed would eat fruit and trade their [[Bactrian camel]]s for [[Dromedary|single humped]] ones. After Kashi they would keep going until they reached their next destination.\n\nLocated about {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} southwest of the city, the [[Crescent Lake (Dunhuang)|Crescent Lake]] or Yueyaquan is an oasis and popular spot for tourists seeking respite from the heat of the desert. Activities includes camel and 4x4 rides.\n\n===Silk Route Museum===\n{{main|Silk Route Museum}}\nThe Silk Route Museum is located in [[Jiuquan]] along the [[Silk Road]], a trading route connecting [[Rome]] to China, used by [[Marco Polo]].

Begun in 420&nbsp;AD during the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]], the site contains dozens of caves and caverns filled with outstanding examples of carvings, sculpture, and frescoes. The great Maitreya Buddha is more than 27 meters tall and is similar in style to the great Buddhas that once lined the cliffs of [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Bamiyan]], Afghanistan. Access to the site is by boat from [[Yongjing County|Yongjing]] in the summer or fall.

At that time, Manassas Junction was little more than a railroad crossing, but a strategic one, with rails leading to [[Richmond, Virginia]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Shenandoah Valley]].

[[I-66]] and [[US-29]] service Manassas, but neither passes through the city itself.\n\n===Airports===\n[[Manassas Regional Airport]] is located within the city limits.  The Manassas Regional Airport is the busiest general aviation airport in the Commonwealth of Virginia with more than 415 based aircraft and 26 businesses based onsite ranging from charter companies, avionics, maintenance, flight schools and aircraft services.\n\n[[File:Cardinal arriving in Manassas.jpg|thumb|right|{{w|Amtrak}} 50, the ''{{w|Cardinal (train)|Cardinal}}'', is arriving in {{w|Manassas station}} on a Friday evening. The train left {{w|Chicago}} last evening and is on its way to {{w|New York City}}. The station is shared with {{w|Virginia Railway Express}} and hosts the city's visitors center.]]\n\n===Rail transportation===\nManassas began life as ''Manassas Junction'', so named for the railroad junction between the [[Orange and Alexandria Railroad]] and the [[Manassas Gap Railroad]].  The O&A owned the railway from Alexandria through Manassas to points south, ending in [[Orange, Virginia]], while the MGRR was an independent line constructed from Manassas Junction through the [[Manassas Gap]] westward. In addition Manassas was the site of the first large scale military use of railroad transportation.\n\nThese original routes are now owned by the [[Norfolk Southern]] railroad. [[Amtrak]] and the [[Virginia Railway Express]] (VRE) provide regular inter-city and commuter service to the city and surrounding area on the tracks owned by NS. [[Manassas station]] is served by VRE and three Amtrak routes - the [[New York City]] to [[Chicago]] [[Cardinal (Amtrak)|''Cardinal'']], [[Boston]] to [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] ''[[Northeast Regional]]'', and New York to [[New Orleans]] [[Crescent (Amtrak)|''Crescent'']].\n\nThe train station was also used for the cover photo for the [[Manassas (album)]].\n\n==Education==\n\n=== Public Education ===\nThe City of Manassas is served by the [[Manassas City Public Schools]]. There are five elementary schools in Manassas, two intermediate school, one middle school, and one high school.  In 2006, Mayfield Intermediate School opened, serving students in fifth and sixth grade. Due to growth, Baldwin Intermediate School opened in September 2017, also serving 5th and 6th graders.\n\nSome schools in the [[Prince William County Public Schools]] district have Manassas addresses, though they are located, and serve areas, outside the Manassas city limits.\n\nSeton School, a private Roman Catholic junior and senior high school affiliated with the [[Diocese of Arlington]], provides Catholic education from its Manassas location.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://setonschool.net/|title=Welcome to Seton School - Private Catholic High School|website=Seton School Manassas|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>  The All Saints Catholic School at the All Saints Parish provides Catholic Education from pre-K through 8th grade.
