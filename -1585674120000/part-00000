The procedure is sometimes semi-public, accompanied with music, special foods, and much festivity.\n\nThere is no equivalent of a Jewish [[mohel]] in Islam. Circumcisions are usually carried out in [[Health facility|health facilities]] or [[hospital]]s, and performed by trained medical practitioners.<ref name=\"Anwer 2017\"/> The circumciser is not required to be a Muslim.<ref name=\"bbc\" /> The position of the scar is usually neither fully \"low\" nor fully \"high\". The only requirement is to have the glans fully exposed at all times and enough of the skin removed to ensure that there are no folds that allow accumulation of body fluids (urine). This is required to ensure the hygiene requirements for the ''[[salat]]'' (daily prayers). However, due to a relatively secular approach to circumcision in Islam, the \"styles\" of the circumcision of a Muslim vary on every individual, and change in the light of new medical knowledge.\n\nEarlier, instead of being carried out in hospitals, they would be carried out in local clinics and at homes by visiting circumciser.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Celebrations==\nIn Indonesia, after a child is circumcised, there is a feast called [[Perayaan Sunatan]], but some ulemas in Indonesia say this is [[bid\u2018ah]] whereas most of them say it is not.

The procedure is sometimes semi-public, accompanied with music, special foods, and much festivity.\n\nThere is no equivalent of a Jewish [[mohel]] in Islam. Circumcisions are usually carried out in [[Health facility|health facilities]] or [[hospital]]s, and performed by trained medical practitioners.<ref name=\"Anwer 2017\"/> The circumciser is not required to be a Muslim.<ref name=\"bbc\" /> The position of the scar is usually neither fully \"low\" nor fully \"high\". The only requirement is to have the glans fully exposed at all times and enough of the skin removed to ensure that there are no folds that allow accumulation of body fluids (urine). This is required to ensure the hygiene requirements for the ''[[salat]]'' (daily prayers). However, due to a relatively secular approach to circumcision in Islam, the \"styles\" of the circumcision of a Muslim vary on every individual, and change in the light of new medical knowledge.\n\nEarlier, instead of being carried out in hospitals, they would be carried out in local clinics and at homes by visiting circumciser.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Celebrations==\nIn Indonesia, after a child is circumcised, there is a feast called [[Perayaan Sunatan]], but some ulemas in Indonesia say this is [[bid\u2018ah]] whereas most of them say it is not.

The UK State Pension was payable in countries like the UK, the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) and a number of disparate countries (the [[United States]], for example), whilst not being payable in predominantly Commonwealth countries such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]. The civil action was held in the Administration Court of the Queens Bench Division of the High Court. Carson lost her case, with the [[Stanley Burnton|Honourable Mr. Justice Burnton]] saying that the decision to uprate the UK State Pension was legislative rather than judicial. Carson was given leave to appeal, and the appeal was heard in 2003. Carson lost this appeal, but was given leave to appeal, this time to the [[House of Lords]]. This appeal heard in 2005.

For example, TICA's Himalayan is considered a colorpoint variety of the Persian by CFA, while the Javanese (or Colorpoint Longhair) is a color variation of the Balinese in TICA and CFA; both breeds are merged (along with the Colorpoint Shorthair) into a single \"mega-breed\", the Colourpoint<!--The WCF name is always spelled with a u-->, by the [[World Cat Federation]] (WCF), who have repurposed the name \"Javanese\" for the [[Oriental Longhair]]. Also, \"Colo[u]rpoint Longhair\" refers to different breeds in other registries. There are many examples of nomenclatural overlap and differences of this sort. Furthermore, many geographical and cultural names for cat breeds are fanciful selections made by Western breeders to be exotic sounding and bear no relationship to the actual origin of the breeds;<ref>{{cite book |last=Somerville |first=Louisa |title=The Ultimate Guide to Cat Breeds |date=2007 |publisher=Chartwell Books |location=Edison, New Jersey |isbn=9780785822646 |page=44 |quote=There is a lot of confusion surrounding the use of this name in the cat world, although it is always used to describe cats of distinctly Oriental type.

Some registries permit them to be [[Pedigree (animal)|pedigreed]] and they have been used as [[foundation stock]] in the establishment of some breeds.

For example, TICA's Himalayan is considered a colorpoint variety of the Persian by CFA, while the Javanese (or Colorpoint Longhair) is a color variation of the Balinese in TICA and CFA; both breeds are merged (along with the Colorpoint Shorthair) into a single \"mega-breed\", the Colourpoint<!--The WCF name is always spelled with a u-->, by the [[World Cat Federation]] (WCF), who have repurposed the name \"Javanese\" for the [[Oriental Longhair]]. Also, \"Colo[u]rpoint Longhair\" refers to different breeds in other registries. There are many examples of nomenclatural overlap and differences of this sort.

Three years later, after Sharif had been captured by the Dey of [[Algiers]], he took control of the Turkish army in Tunis and, on 12 July 1705, had himself proclaimed [[Bey of Tunis]]. He had one of his close relatives proclaimed ''[[dey]]'' by the [[Constantinople]] [[Divan|diwan]], an act which increased his popularity amongst the Ottoman janissaries, and he was also able to gain support from his Tunisian subjects; however, his entourage was mostly composed of [[Mamluk]]s. Husayn's first councillor was a Frenchman from [[Toulon]], a literate man who had helped him in gaining power.\n\nHe imposed a unity upon the country by having Sharif assassinated at [[Ghar el-Melh]] upon his release from captivity. A pious man, Al-Husayn also used Islam to unite Tunisia's numerous different ethnicities. He built numerous edifices dedicated to religion and religious studies (''[[madrasa]]s''), such as the Madrasahs of the Dyers (1727) and al-Husseyniah in Tunis, as well as the mosque of [[Le Bardo]] and other madrasas in the country's mainland ([[Kairouan]], [[Sfax]], [[Sousse]] and [[Nafta, Tunisia|Nafta]]).\n\n[[File:Medersa Ennakhla 6.jpg|thumb|Madrasa Ennakhla ]]\n\nIn 1726 he ordered the construction of [[El Jedid Mosque]] in Tunis.<ref name=\"MUN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.commune-tunis.gov.tn/fr/culture_lieu_culte0.htm|title=Lieux de culte Municipalit\u00e9 de Tunis|publisher=Government of Tunis|language=French|accessdate=23 July  2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811155804/http://www.commune-tunis.gov.tn/fr/culture_lieu_culte0.htm|archivedate=11 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jemaa el jadid 04.JPG|thumb|El jadid Mosque ]]\n\nHusayn tried to establish a succession to the title of bey for his sons Muhammad and Ali (born in 1710 and 1712, respectively). His nephew [[Abu l-Hasan Ali I|Ali Pasha]], who had been plotting against him and had been therefore put under surveillance by Husayn, was able to escape and revolted, with the help of local tribes and of the [[Dey of Algiers]].

Three years later, after Sharif had been captured by the Dey of [[Algiers]], he took control of the Turkish army in Tunis and, on 12 July 1705, had himself proclaimed [[Bey of Tunis]]. He had one of his close relatives proclaimed ''[[dey]]'' by the [[Constantinople]] [[Divan|diwan]], an act which increased his popularity amongst the Ottoman janissaries, and he was also able to gain support from his Tunisian subjects; however, his entourage was mostly composed of [[Mamluk]]s. Husayn's first councillor was a Frenchman from [[Toulon]], a literate man who had helped him in gaining power.\n\nHe imposed a unity upon the country by having Sharif assassinated at [[Ghar el-Melh]] upon his release from captivity. A pious man, Al-Husayn also used Islam to unite Tunisia's numerous different ethnicities. He built numerous edifices dedicated to religion and religious studies (''[[madrasa]]s''), such as the Madrasahs of the Dyers (1727) and al-Husseyniah in Tunis, as well as the mosque of [[Le Bardo]] and other madrasas in the country's mainland ([[Kairouan]], [[Sfax]], [[Sousse]] and [[Nafta, Tunisia|Nafta]]).\n\n[[File:Medersa Ennakhla 6.jpg|thumb|Madrasa Ennakhla ]]\n\nIn 1726 he ordered the construction of [[El Jedid Mosque]] in Tunis.<ref name=\"MUN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.commune-tunis.gov.tn/fr/culture_lieu_culte0.htm|title=Lieux de culte Municipalit\u00e9 de Tunis|publisher=Government of Tunis|language=French|accessdate=23 July  2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811155804/http://www.commune-tunis.gov.tn/fr/culture_lieu_culte0.htm|archivedate=11 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jemaa el jadid 04.JPG|thumb|El jadid Mosque ]]\n\nHusayn tried to establish a succession to the title of bey for his sons Muhammad and Ali (born in 1710 and 1712, respectively).

In 1991, Nando Boom and El General released their covers of \"Dem Bow\", \"Ellos Benia\" and \"Son Bow\", which translated Shabba's original lyrics from English to Spanish. Additionally, the word \u201cbow\u201d was transformed from a verb describing illicit sexuality to a noun used to label a gay person as a social pariah. Other Dem Bow remixes of the mid-'90s originated from Puerto Rico and New York in the form of long, 30-minute mixtapes that fused digital samples of hip-hop, dancehall and the riddim of reggaeton hits. These chopped up mixes of reggaeton and hip-hop created a new intercultural space of blackness within the urban diaspora of New York and San Juan. Additionally, while the introduction of accessible digital production tools widened the inter-diasporic sonic conversation across genres, it also provided a mechanism for the widespread commercialization of reggaeton into reggaeton pop. As seen in Wisin & Yandel's 2003 version of Dem Bow, while there is a remnant of the original riddim, Ranks' political message of anti-colonialism and homophobia is erased and transformed into a song about sensuality. Although there is no explicit retention of these political messages, there is a retention of the implicit \"macho pose\" of Shabba Ranks<ref name=\":1\" />. Instead of expressing this machismo through homophobia Dem Bow expresses it through the traditional form of objectifying women<ref name=\":1\" />. \n\nIn considering these transnational exchanges, there were a variety of factors that fed into the shaping and popularization of reggaeton. The 1990s to early 2000s marked a key shift within the genre. There was an evident erasure of black diasporic roots. For example, in the mid 1990s, the genre was often referred to as \u201cmusica negra\u201d or just hip-hop/reggae; however, as the genre grew and popularized, it became more widely known as \u201creggaeton Latino.\u201d This shift in branding during the early 2000s was coined as \u201c[[blanqueamiento]]\u201d or whitening.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, the sanitization of reggaeton was marked by this intentional movement away from blackness.\n\nThere are various influences that produce this genre as they extend across Jamaican, Panamanian, Puerto Rican, and US culture. While there is existing controversy over which artists/groups can claim ownership over reggaeton, \u201cDem Bow\u201d embodied the base culture that centered and informed the shaping of reggaeton. The history of this musical evolution starts with transnational exchanges between Jamaica and Panama. Many were influenced by Anglo-Caribbean migrant workers who resided in Panama in the late 1970s, and in turn Panamanian artists were the first to perform reggae in Spanish.<ref name=\":0\" /> Often earlier covers of \u201cDem Bow\u201d were lyrically very exact in meaning and translation. However, during these translations there was a significant change of the use of the word \"bow\" from a verb to a noun. In the original Dem Bow song by Shabba Ranks ''bow'' was used as a verb trying to persuade listeners to not ''bow'' to foreign influence. In El General's song entitled ''Son Bow'', \"bow\" is used as a noun and not a verb<ref name=\":1\" />.  Evidently, there was a clear audible engagement with Jamaican riddims, narratives, and socio-political life. These translations and connections were further complicated by expressions of anti-colonial resistance and anti-gay sentiment in the genre.

Later that year, Khanna starred in [[J. P. Dutta]]'s war drama ''[[Border (1997 film)|Border]]'' alongside [[Sunny Deol]], [[Suniel Shetty]], and [[Jackie Shroff]]. Set during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], the film was about the events of the [[Battle of Longewala]] and saw Khanna play the real-life role of Dharamvir Singh Bhan, a commander who is also a part of the battle.

Khanna's final release of 1997 was the romance ''[[Mohabbat (1997 film)|Mohabbat]]'', in which he starred alongside [[Madhuri Dixit]] and [[Sanjay Kapoor]]. The film received a negative critical reception and was commercially unsuccessful.\n\nThe following year, Khanna starred opposite [[Jyothika]] in [[Priyadarshan]]'s romantic drama ''[[Doli Saja Ke Rakhna]]'' (1998), in which he portrayed a rich person who falls in love with Jyothika's character.

Set in Mumbai, it focuses on a major period of transition in the lives of three young friends. Khanna featured as one of the friends named Siddharth Sinha, a quiet and reticent boy.

It received negative reviews from critics and flopped at the box office, but has attained a [[cult status]] over years. Khanna's next role was in ''[[36 China Town]]'', a murder-mystery comedy adapted from the American film ''[[Once Upon a Crime]]'' and co-starring Kareena Kapoor and [[Shahid Kapoor]]. Directed by Abbas\u2013Mustan, the film featured him as a police officer, and proved to be a financial success with earnings of over {{INRConvert|369|m}} worldwide. Khanna's final film release that year was [[Dharmesh Darshan]]'s romantic comedy ''[[Aap Ki Khatir (2006 film)|Aap Ki Khatir]]'' alongside [[Priyanka Chopra]], Ameesha Patel, Suniel Shetty, and [[Anupam Kher]].

He was featured in the first and second chapter opposite [[Ayesha Takia]]. The film received negative reviews from critics and emerged as a major commercial disappointment.

In his final release of that year, Khanna teamed with [[Anil Mehta]] for the dance film ''[[Aaja Nachle]]'', co-starring [[Madhuri Dixit]], [[Konkona Sen Sharma]], [[Kunaal Roy Kapur]], and [[Jugal Hansraj]], which underperformed at the box office.\n\n===Establishing, another failures, and sabbatical (2008\u201312)===\n\nKhanna's performance in the Abbas\u2013Mustan-directed action thriller ''[[Race (2008 film)|Race]]'' (2008) marked a turning point in his career. Cast alongside Saif Ali Khan, Anil Kapoor, [[Katrina Kaif]], and [[Bipasha Basu]], Khanna garnered praise for his portrayal of the main antagonist Rajiv Singh, an alcoholic person who plots to kill his half brother (played by Khan) to secure his wealth.

For his final release of 2008, he reunited with Priyadarshan in the comedy ''[[Mere Baap Pehle Aap]]'', co-starring Paresh Rawal, [[Genelia D'Souza]], and [[Archana Puran Singh]]. The film was a critical and commercial failure, and Khanna's performance was largely criticised.\n\nKhanna's only release in 2009 was [[Neeraj Vora]]'s romantic comedy ''[[Shortkut]]'', in which he starred alongside Amrita Rao and [[Arshad Warsi]], playing the character of Shekhar, an assistant director who hopes to be a writer and director too. The feature garnered negative reviews from critics and bombed at the box office. The following year, he featured in three commercial failures\u2014the first of which was Priyadarshan's action thriller ''[[Aakrosh (2010 film)|Aakrosh]]''.

Khanna's final film of that year was ''[[Tees Maar Khan (2010 film)|Tees Maar Khan]]'', a slapstick comedy directed by [[Farah Khan]] and co-starring [[Akshay Kumar]] and Katrina Kaif. Khanna's role was that of a popular but greedy actor. The film was a semi-hit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficeindia.com/circuit_collection.php?movieid=76&cityid=8&area=domestic|title=Tees Maar Khan - Movie - - Box Office India|website=www.boxofficeindia.com|access-date=25 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008173533/http://boxofficeindia.com/circuit_collection.php?movieid=76&cityid=8&area=domestic|archive-date=8 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> at the box office, his performance earned him a nomination for the [[Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role \u2013 Male]].\n\nIn 2012, Khanna starred in ''[[Gali Gali Chor Hai]]'', an ensemble romantic comedy directed by Rumi Jaffrey and co-starring [[Shriya Saran]] and [[Mugdha Godse]].

Argentina is currently #1 in the [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] Davis Cup rankings.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Argentina Davis Cup team.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Argentine team with the trophies won at [[Casa Rosada]], November 2016.]]\nArgentina's Davis Cup debut in [[1921 International Lawn Tennis Challenge|1921]] started on the wrong foot with a [[walkover]] loss to [[Denmark Davis Cup team|Denmark]] in the first round. They played their first Davis Cup matches in [[1923 International Lawn Tennis Challenge|1923]], losing 1\u20134 in the first round against [[Switzerland Davis Cup team|Switzerland]]. After several years of toiling in the regional and preliminary rounds, led by [[Guillermo Vilas]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Clerc]], Argentina reached their first finals in [[1981 Davis Cup|1981]], losing to the [[United States Davis Cup team|United States]]. After avoiding relegation from the World Group the next year, Argentina reached the semifinals in [[1983 Davis Cup|1983]], losing in [[Stockholm]] against the [[Sweden Davis Cup team|Swedish team]]. In the subsequent years, Argentina couldn't repeat that performance and was relegated to the Americas I Group in [[1987 Davis Cup|1987]]. Returned in the [[1990 Davis Cup|1990]]-[[1992 Davis Cup|92]] World Group, that year was relegated to the Americas Zone again and would not return to main competition until the [[2002 Davis Cup]], reaching the semifinals again in a loss to [[Russia Davis Cup team|Russia]] that included a historical doubles match between [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] and [[Marat Safin]] against [[David Nalbandian]] and [[Lucas Arnold Ker]] that at 6 hours and 20 minutes is the longest doubles match in recorded history.<ref>[http://www.daviscup.com/en/teams/team/profile.aspx?id=ARG Argentina Team Profile], DavisCup.com</ref> Since 2002, Argentina has reached the finals on four occasions in [[2006 Davis Cup|2006]], [[2008 Davis Cup|2008]], [[2011 Davis Cup|2011]] and [[2016 Davis Cup|2016]]. They were crowned as champions for the first time after defeating Croatia in the final in [[2016 Davis Cup|2016]]. However, the following year they were relegated to the first group of the Americas Zone.\n\n==Venues==\nArgentina played all of their home games at the [[Buenos Aires Lawn Tennis Club]] up until 1996.

As of 2016, the team has competed in the World Group since 2002 and reached the finals five times ([[1981 Davis Cup|1981]], [[2006 Davis Cup|2006]], [[2008 Davis Cup|2008]], [[2011 Davis Cup|2011]] and [[2016 Davis Cup|2016]]), winning the cup for the first time in the [[2016 Davis Cup|2016]] edition by defeating [[Croatia Davis Cup team|Croatia]] in the final. Argentina is currently #1 in the [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] Davis Cup rankings.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Argentina Davis Cup team.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Argentine team with the trophies won at [[Casa Rosada]], November 2016.]]\nArgentina's Davis Cup debut in [[1921 International Lawn Tennis Challenge|1921]] started on the wrong foot with a [[walkover]] loss to [[Denmark Davis Cup team|Denmark]] in the first round. They played their first Davis Cup matches in [[1923 International Lawn Tennis Challenge|1923]], losing 1\u20134 in the first round against [[Switzerland Davis Cup team|Switzerland]]. After several years of toiling in the regional and preliminary rounds, led by [[Guillermo Vilas]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Clerc]], Argentina reached their first finals in [[1981 Davis Cup|1981]], losing to the [[United States Davis Cup team|United States]]. After avoiding relegation from the World Group the next year, Argentina reached the semifinals in [[1983 Davis Cup|1983]], losing in [[Stockholm]] against the [[Sweden Davis Cup team|Swedish team]]. In the subsequent years, Argentina couldn't repeat that performance and was relegated to the Americas I Group in [[1987 Davis Cup|1987]]. Returned in the [[1990 Davis Cup|1990]]-[[1992 Davis Cup|92]] World Group, that year was relegated to the Americas Zone again and would not return to main competition until the [[2002 Davis Cup]], reaching the semifinals again in a loss to [[Russia Davis Cup team|Russia]] that included a historical doubles match between [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] and [[Marat Safin]] against [[David Nalbandian]] and [[Lucas Arnold Ker]] that at 6 hours and 20 minutes is the longest doubles match in recorded history.<ref>[http://www.daviscup.com/en/teams/team/profile.aspx?id=ARG Argentina Team Profile], DavisCup.com</ref> Since 2002, Argentina has reached the finals on four occasions in [[2006 Davis Cup|2006]], [[2008 Davis Cup|2008]], [[2011 Davis Cup|2011]] and [[2016 Davis Cup|2016]]. They were crowned as champions for the first time after defeating Croatia in the final in [[2016 Davis Cup|2016]]. However, the following year they were relegated to the first group of the Americas Zone.\n\n==Venues==\nArgentina played all of their home games at the [[Buenos Aires Lawn Tennis Club]] up until 1996. Since then, other venues were used, not only in [[Buenos Aires]],<ref>[http://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=100004090 Argentina vs. Russia, 04 Apr \u2013 06 Apr 2003], DavisCup.com.</ref><ref>[http://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=10000436 Argentina vs. Colombia, 13 Feb \u2013 15 Feb 1998], DavisCup.com.</ref> but also in other cities such as [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]],<ref>[http://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=100002049 Argentina vs. Belarus, 21 Sep \u2013 23 Sep 2003], DavisCup.com.</ref> [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]<ref>[http://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=100000366 Argentina vs. Mexico, 09 Feb \u2013 11 Feb 2001], DavisCup.com.</ref> and [[Mar del Plata]],<ref>[http://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=10000385 Argentina vs. Bahamas, 05 Apr \u2013 07 Apr 1996], DavisCup.com.</ref> the city of choice for the [[2008 Davis Cup|2008 Finals]], the only series of this kind Argentina has hosted so far and also their only home series that was not played on [[Clay court|clay]].<ref>[http://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=100010174 Argentina vs. Spain, 21 Nov \u2013 23 Nov 2008], DavisCup.com.</ref> Since 2006, Argentina began to play their home matches at the [[Estadio Mary Ter\u00e1n de Weiss|Mary Ter\u00e1n de Weiss Stadium]] in Buenos Aires.<ref>[http://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=100007696 Argentina vs. Sweden, 10 Feb \u2013 12 Feb 2006], DavisCup.com.</ref>\n\n==Current squad==\n{{see also|List of Argentina Davis Cup team representatives}}\n\n''Rankings as of 2 April 2018''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+Squad representing Argentina vs. Chile (2018 Davis Cup Americas Group I)\n!width=150| Player !!

Since then, greed and hatred has taken over humanity and has been deteriorating it for past 6000 years. To end this, a mystical sect of saints known as \"Suryanshis\" chose a man to rise up against all odds and defeat the evil prevailing within society. He was taught the way to energise the 7 chakras of body through Kundalini Yoga that helped him get mystical and supernatural powers. During his training, he also conducted the ritual of death in order to get total control over his powers by entering the holy fire and immersing his physical body in it. When the five natural elements of life, fire, earth, water, wind and sky invigorated his body, he gains superpowers and becomes a [[Superhuman]]. At last, he takes a pledge to finish corruption and injustice in society and fight the evil prevailing in the world. Due to his heroic initial works, he is named Shaktimaan by a reporter, [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. Later, it is revealed that\nShaktimaan was the rebirth of Shri Satya who was part of the Suryanshi Sect during the Mahabharata era 5,000 years ago.\n\nHis alter-ego is a funny geek named Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri, who works as a photographer in a daily newspaper office to maintain his secret identity as Shaktimaan and speaks pure [[Hindi]].\n\nShaktimaan's nemesis is Tamraj Kilvish, who is the living embodiment of the evil and dark forces of the world.\n\nShaktimaan is another common human being, but reincarnation of Shri Satya, but has got his internal spiritual powers ignited with the continuous and typical practice of [[Hindu Philosophy|Hindu philosophical]] and cultural values system and activities like [[Yoga|Yog Sadhna]] and [[Meditation]]. Also, he follows the morals and ethical values of truth, non-violence, and values stated in books like the [[Bhagavad Gita]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mukesh Khanna]] as Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri / Shaktimaan, Major Ranjeet Singh (Shaktimaan's Father), Shree Satya (Previous Incarnation of Shaktimaan), Evil Clone Shaktimaan\n* [[Kitu Gidwani]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 1-16)\n* [[Vaishnavi Mahant]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 16-520)\n* [[Surendra Pal]] as Tamraj Kilvish / Guru Sarvagya\n* [[Tom Alter]] as Mahaguru\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]] as Dr. Jaikaal\n* [[Arun Bakshi]] as Dr. Jaikaal (in last few episodes)\n* Raman Khatri as Sahab / Kumar Ranjan\n* Sharad Smart as Satyaprakash Nirala, the 1st editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Raju Shrivastav]] as Durandhar Singh, the 2nd editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Manjeet Kullar]] as Kaushalya / Maharani Shavalika, Shaktimaan's biological mother\n* [[Ashwini Kalsekar]] as Shalaaka / Kaali Billi\n* [[Dolly Minhas]] as Shaliyaa / Safed Billi, elder sister and guardian of Shalaaka\n* [[Kishore Bhanushali]] as Naurangee the thief\n* [[Rajendra Gupta]] as Prof. Vishwas, paranormal scientist, Geeta Vishwas's father.\n* Jay Mishra as Ghosh Babu\n* [[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as Mayor JJ \"Jai Kumar Janardhan\" / Kakodar\n* [[Deepshikha Nagpal]] as Paroma and Sheraali (dual roles)\n* Sunila Karambelkar as Queen Mayaadri and Natasha in starting episodes\n* Brij Mohan Pandey as Bankelal / Toyman\n* Sanjeev Chaddha as Shudhanshu ji\n* Ajit Mehra as Shwami Ji\n* [[Arun Bali]] as Dayal Chopra, Businessman and owner of Aaj Ki Awaz\n* [[Zahida Parveen]] as Nisha Saluja, reporter who replaced Geeta at Aaj Ki Awaz\n* Hemal Dharia as Hemal\n* Sharad Smart as Satya Prakash Nirala\n* Urmila Amar as Leela Lautekar\n*[[Nupur Alankar]] as Kaamini, Film gossip writer at ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Shikha Swaroop]] as Alien (special appearance)\n* [[Goga Kapoor]] as Bilas Rao\n* Zeena Bhatia as Matandeeka Witch\n* [[Deepraj Rana]] as Inspector Jai Singh, a Corrupt Police officer.\n* [[Urvashi Dholakia]] as Maansi Sharma\n* Annu Kashyap as Teemira / Behroopia\n* [[Neelam Mehra]] as Maansi\n* Shravani Goswami as Shalini (Bengali Bahu)\n* Durgesh Nandini as Rachna (Punjabi Bahu)\n* Manav Sohal as Shalini's husband\n\n== Production ==\n''Shaktimaan'' was conceptualised by Khanna in 1981, when he was working on a film with [[Rajshri Productions]]. He narrated the idea to producer Rajkumar Barjatya, who liked it, and the two adapted it into a film titled ''Akash''. In November 1997, ''[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]]'' reported quoted him: \"I would watch my nephew sitting glued to the TV whenever ''Power Zone'' came on, shooting with imaginary [[laser guns]], or operating some imaginary hi-fi gadget in his own little world. That's when it struck me that if I made ''Shaktimaan'' I would have a readymade audience of kids who are always most impressed with [[Special effects|SFX]] tricks.\" Over the development of the titular character, Khanna said, \"In Indian mythology there are a lot of strong characters but no super-heroes. All we get to see are [[Superman]] or [[Spider-Man|Spiderman]], who are alien concepts. That's why I decided to create an Indian super-hero, Shaktimaan, who is born out of a [[yagna]], and a result of all the creative energies of the universe. A superhero who can fly...disappear. And when he is not in his super-hero [[Dual role|avataar]] he's a bumbling photographer who always misses scoop much to the chagrin of his boss Kitu Gidwani.\" He added that the attire of Shaktimaan's alter ego, \"complete with buck teeth and floppy hair\" was inspired by American comedian [[Jerry Lewis]].<ref name=\"screen\">{{cite web |title=Mukesh Khanna: No More Mthologicals |url=http://www.screenindia.com/nov14/tele1.htm |website=Screen |accessdate=14 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031031211440/http://www.screenindia.com/nov14/tele1.htm |archivedate=31 October 2003 |date=November 1997}}</ref>\n\nHaving wanted the \"best ever\" special effects seen on Indian television, following the series' airing, Khanna felt that it \"[fell] short of [his] expectations\". He added, \"When I had planned the serial I wanted the kind of special effects seen in ''Superman'', ''Spiderman'' and ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]''. Maybe I was too ambitious. [[Computer graphics]] has just arrived in India and there is lack of trained professionals here.\" He further said, the special effects for each episode costed him {{INR}}2 [[lakh]], and {{INR}}10 lakh overall.<ref name=\"screen\"/>\n\nThe series was sponsored by [[Parle-G]] from its first episode.<ref name=\"screen\"/>\n\n== Fictional biography ==\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Shaktimaan\n| series             = Shaktimaan\n| caption            = [[Mukesh Khanna]] as Shaktimaan\n| first              = Episode -01 As Pandit Gangadhar.\n| last               = ''Shalu Dupes Sethji''\n| creator            = [[Mukesh Khanna]]\n| portrayer          = [[Mukesh Khanna]]\n| nickname           = Gangadhar\n| alias              = Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shashtri\n| species            = Human ([[Yogi]])\n| occupation         = [[Photographer]] for 'Aaj ki Awaj' newspaper & <br /> [[Professor]]\n| gender             = Male\n| title              = Shashtri\n| family             = Major Ranjit Singh (biological father) <br /> Kaushalya Ranjit Singh (biological mother) <br /> Vidyadhar Shashtri (Foster Father) <br /> Mayadhar Shashtri (Foster Grandfather) <br /> Omkarnath Shashtri (Foster Great Grandfather)\n| children           = none\n| nationality        = [[Indian]]\n| color              = {{colour box |Brown}}\n| full_name          = Gangadhar Vidyadhar Shastri\n| aliases            = The Suryvanshis , Gita Vishwas.\n| religion           = [[Hindu]]\n| affiliation        = Suryvanshi\n| origin             = Himalaya, India.\n| weapon             = Super powers.\n| race               = Human\n| position           = Protect earth from evils, bad peoples and Tamraj Kilvish\n}}\n\n===Origin===\nShaktimaan received powers from seven gurus who trained and blessed him with \"yogic [[shakti]] which was natural power.\" He was the chosen warrior against evil by siddha gurus of a cult named ''Suryavanshi''. They are followers of the star ''Sun''. As part of training, he trained with [[Kundalini Yoga]] to awake the 7 chakras of body and gain 'supernatural' powers from them. To gain complete control over his powers he performed the ritual of death. However, this did not cause death but made him more alive than when he was a normal man. He also performed [[Yajna]] in which he entered the fire himself and dissolved his body in fire. Then, the five elements of life, i.e. fire, wind, water, earth, sky revived his body giving him special powers from them. Thus after leaving his mortal body he was given a superhuman form to fight against the evil in the world as Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgrZ2ofIcT8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 1|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Shaktimaan was created he set out to destroy his archenemy Kilvish. But, as the Mahaguru ([[Tom Alter]]) explained, Kilvish can only be defeated after evil is destroyed. Shaktimaan's mission is to destroy the sin within people, not the sinned people. Shaktimaan's adventures show him pursuing justice and saving his friends while Kilvish and his minions plot to defeat him.\n\n=== Powers ===\nShaktimaan has superhuman powers which lie inside his body in his seven chakras of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] attained through meditation. Shaktimaan worships God through the symbol [[Om]]. Truthfulness is his motto. He can even separate his body into five different bodies of fire, wind, water, earth and sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuTDNEmCzB8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 43|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> He is an expert, skilled and intelligent fighter and has fought with super-skilled enemies. He possesses physical powers like unlimited speed (up to the speed of light), strength, durability as well as psychic powers like telepathy, teleportation, telekinesis etc.\nAlthough he possesses godlike powers, his only weakness is a crystal (Papmani) possessed by Tamraj Kilvish which can be used to defeat and even kill him. This makes him powerless because it is filled with the evil of the world and is the source of the black powers. But he regains his strength after the crystal is taken away from him. He can be killed if the crystal is placed in front of him and he is treated violently to the verge of death. Shaktimaan also gets brief premonitions about the incidents that are going to happen to him in future. This can be observed in kashtak's episode, Geeta going to jail and in kapala's reappearance episodes.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cuwX6vm8dqw | title = Shaktimaan episode 172}}</ref>\n\nShaktimaan's powers are virtually limitless. He can do practically anything he imagines. The only limit to his powers is his own belief in himself and his knowledge of how to manifest his powers. His powers come from his chakras. (Note: Although we'll call them chakras in the vedas, in the series dialogue they will also be called energy centers.)\n\nThe seven chakras in his body which give him powers are:\n* Energy Chakra (1): This chakra gives Shaktimaan super strength enabling him to fly, shoot fire from his hands, emit rays from his fingertips, blow a stream of freezing air, or send out protective force fields which nothing can penetrate (provided he can maintain his willpower and not give in). Shaktimaan's strength allows him to physically penetrate anything and lift any object.\n* Creative Chakra (2): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to manifest things out of thin air.\n* Astral Chakra (3): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control his astral body (a semi-transparent, ethereal duplicate of himself) which can fly, walk through walls, see inside objects, etc.\n* Heart Chakra (4): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control the will of others, but only for good. He can will people to do the right thing, see the error in their ways. This power is most useful when Shaktimaan needs to stop someone who is under the control of Kilvish from doing evil.\n* Vibration Chakra (5): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control all types of vibrations, including sound waves, light waves, healing warmth, etc. He can also use it to hear ultrasonic sounds, and can speed up the vibrations of his own atoms allowing him to transport himself in space or time. This can be very useful for getting out of dangerous situations.\n* Psychic Chakra (6): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power of the \"third eye\" which enables him to read minds and see anywhere in the world at any distance.

The character Gangadhar is completely opposite to that of Shaktimaan in all aspects e.g. appearance, intelligence while he speaks pure [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. Whenever he gets any important job to do, he says that he has written a book on it which had never been published. Staying in the society as a common person helped him to get knowledge about crime. He got a job of a photographer for the newspaper ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' after being interviewed by [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. After a few weeks, he became a co-reporter working with Geeta. Through a series of incidents and the fact that he could never capture a photo of Shaktimaan, Geeta came to know about the dual identity of Shaktimaan, which was previously known only to Suryanshis. After ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, Gangadhar became a Hindi professor at a junior college. Later, he left the college to work for a news channel ''KR TV'' with Geeta.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n\n==== Geeta Vishwas ====\nGeeta Vishwas ([[Vaishnavi Mahant]], previously [[Kitu Gidwani]]), the female lead in the serial, used to work as a brave news reporter in ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''. She was the first to report about Shaktimaan in newspaper and named the superhero as ''Shaktimaan''. Incidentally, she was the only reporter to get interviews of Shaktimaan as Gangadhar used to accompany her as photographer in missions. She died in a crash planned by Dr. Jackal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0r8M4plt9c|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 101|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> As Shaktimaan loved her, he brought her back to life again using his power which resulted in losing his powers temporarily due to his ''against the nature actions''. Geeta came to know about this after Shaktimaan regained power with the vow that he will never repeat the same mistake again. To ensure this, she planned to leave the country. In the lead up to that situation, she got to know about Shaktimaan's dual character for the third time. But unlike first two occasions, Shaktimaan didn't erase it from Geeta's memory this time as she promised to keep it secret forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y8GUm3-UbA|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 109|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOne year later<sup>\u2021</sup>, after ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, its staff members persuaded Geeta in returning to India to join them to release Shaktimaan comics.

Tamraj means King of Darkness (''tama'' = darkness, ''raj'' = king). He has lived 6000 years and is the source of evil in the world. He intends to rule the world by spreading darkness, hatred, sin and evil. It is said that the source of his strength is one-half of the \"Shakti Punj\" (the half which is referred to as \"shaktiman\") which he managed to retain after he originally obtained the entire Shakti Punj by deceit from Shri Satya (Satya means truth), the founder of the Suryavanshi. However, it is also mentioned that the source of his strength is the evil that is committed by people in this world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB9JLeGRUIk|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 70|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt was later revealed that only Shri Satya can kill Tamraj Kilvish. After a death-defying adventure, Shaktimaan was told that he is the rebirth of Shri Satya. Shri Satya had given the exact time of the child's birth and the place before he died about 6000 years ago. Tamraj also knows this and this is the main reason he is frightened by the appearance of Shaktimaan as he knows that only Shaktimaan can kill Tamraj. He murdered Shaktimaan's parents and his adoptive father, Pandit Vidyadhar Shastri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/shakti.htm |title=International Hero&nbsp;\u2013 Shaktimaan |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> He and his minions plot to kill him but always fail. His minions include Electric-man (who can shoot lightning bolts from his body), Stone-man (who can shoot stones from his body), Plastica (who can stretch any part of her body), Dr. Jackal (an evil scientist) and others. Dr. Jackal has helped Kilvish in his various schemes by cloning Shaktimaan and also by turning aliens against him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |newspaper=Indian Express |title=Bad Boys |date=21 June 2006 |author=Tushar Abhichandani |accessdate=23 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919194526/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |archivedate=19 September 2006  }}</ref>\n\nIn the television series, Kilvish is often treated as the personification of darkness itself even though he was once a human being who later becomes very powerful and commits many evil deeds. In an attempt to become immortal, he left his mortal body and took an ethereal body which can't be killed but Shaktimaan is told that he has to kill all the evil in the world to destroy Tamraj's ethereal body. Kilvish's trademark quote is \"Andhera Kaayam Rahe\" (May Darkness Prevail), which is also used by his followers.\n\nKilvish's character evolves as the series progresses. In the beginning episodes of Shaktimaan, his face is never shown and his voice is different from the voice that he uses in the later episodes of Shaktimaan, in which his role is played by [[Surendra Pal]]. Later his face deforms to become a distorted wolf-like face.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bakwaasbybiswas.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/kilwis.jpg|title=Bakwaas by Biswas (WordPress blog)|accessdate= 13 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Dr. Jackal\nDr. Jackal is an evil scientist who works for Kilvish. His earlier intention was not that of becoming evil, but when he was denied scholarship for research, Kilvish provided him with funds and labs, thus making him a supporter of Kilvish & an evil scientist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iof2Ce4egp8|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 224|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\nThough he is overall a brilliant scientist, his specialisation is cloning and various energy rays.\nHis creations against Shaktimaan include Kekda Man (a clone formed by fusing cells of Crab & human), followed by Jonk Jonkaa (a clone using leech), an evil clone of Shaktimaan, Plastica,\nLightman, 3D image, Super-heroine Sunanda and others.

Like Shaktimaan he also possesses double identity, the other being that of a law-abiding industrialist and Mayor, known as Kumar Ranjan. Except for Tamraj Kilvish (and later Dr. Jackal), no one knows that Sahab and Kumar Ranjan are the same person, thus making this his biggest strength. Through his criminal mind, Sahab keeps plotting ways to create trouble for Shaktimaan or to defame him and to find out about the real identity of Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsseb6UtzyA&list|title=shaktimaan 10 1 2011 0002|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Other enemies ====\n; Kakodar\nKakodar is a sorcerer with the visage of a devil who was imprisoned in a statue nearly five hundred years ago. He could only be freed if a good person removes a thread from his neck. It is unclear whether he was cursed by an enemy or punished by Tamraj to end up imprisoned. In the present day, the mayor of Mumbai, Jai Kumar Janardhan a.k.a. JJ (Nawab Shah) was deceived by his personal assistant Mathur (Deepak Bhatia) to break the thread and free him. Mayor JJ died in shock at seeing Kakodar's true form. As instructed by Madhur, Kakodar possessed JJ's body and decided to spread ''Andhera'' (darkness).\n\nHe was the primary super villain in the first part of the series as he uses JJ's wealth and power to hatch plots to kill Shaktimaan but always failed. Unlike most of other assailants of Shaktimaan, he is very sharp and analytical. He even tries to approach Tarendra, an all knowing sentient being of light, to know the truth about Shaktimaan. He is cunning enough to be able to use mental manipulation to trick Shaktimaan on occasion. This put the hero into a dilemma, and self-doubt drained him of his powers temporarily.\n\nThe full extent of his powers is not revealed. On an occasion, JJ's girlfriend Zuby realises that JJ is possessed by a demon and tries to reveal him in public. He uses hypnosis to drive her mad so that the public will ignore her statements. He has a potent and fatal poison inside him that he can spit out of his mouth which affects everyone except Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan and Kakodar end things in a fight when Kakodar turns into his real form and Shaktimaan turns him back to a statue.\n\n; Natasha\nNatasha (Sunila) was also a demonic evil woman sent by Kilvish. Along with Mathur she serves JJ/Kakodar. She was JJ's secretary before he was possessed. She has the ability to change her appearance. She kills a C.B.I. officer and takes her appearance to interrogate Gangadhar and Geeta on one occasion. Her powers were greatly diminished due to Shaktimaan defeating Kakodar. To regain power she and Madhur decide to sacrifice Shaktimaan. For this they kidnap the son of a scientist to get the formula of ''invisible man'' which may help defeating Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dHANSmJg6A|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 24 |publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Madhur\nMadhur (Deepak Bhatia) is one of the two trusted demonic accomplices of JJ/Kakodar along with Natasha. He initially served JJ as his personal assistant (PA) before he was possessed, but was secretly preparing the stage for Kakodar's entry under Tamraj's directions. His true identity is revealed after Kakodar is released from his imprisonment. Not many of his powers are revealed in the series. He has the ability to change his appearance at will, but not shape shift to assume someone else's body. He also loses his powers when Kakodar was defeated by Shaktimaan.\n\n; Electric-man\nHe was the first synthetic villain faced by Shaktimaan. Dr. Chandola, an evil scientist, created him. Dr. Chandola claims that Electric man was his son, whom he killed so that he can resurrect the dead body with electricity. When he comes to life he kills Dr. Chandola. Without recognising friend from foe he kills everyone in his path and spreads destruction in the city. His powers include shooting electricity from eyes and electrocution on contact. Finding him difficult to restrain, Shaktimaan grabs him and tunnels deep into the earth, pushing him deep underground.\n\n; Kapala\nKapala is a corrupted tantrik who serves Tamraj Kilvish. His primary skill is his shape shifting to inanimate objects such as vehicles and weapons. He also has many other magical devices and servants under his control. One such device is metal plate he wears around his neck that has the power to steal his opponent's strength. The villain Stone man was created from his magic skull. Shaktimaan destroys both the metal plate and the magic skull. He has an odd sense of humor as he makes jokes while fighting Shaktimaan. There are occasions where he serves as a comic relief. This is in contrast to other villains who are stark and serious. He also has a very fragile ego and falls victim to taunts. His main accessory is a trident. Shaktimaan eventually turns him into stone and shatters him at one instance. However, in later episodes of Shaktimaan, he is shown resurrected back to life. He is played by Faqira.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41PAj7P6qKk&list|title=shaktimaan 28 12 2010 0003|publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUChETYxkQo|title=shaktimaan 8 12 2010 0001 |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Khali-Bali\nKhali and Bali are two dwarvish green and red imps. Their names originate from the Urdu word Khalbali which means commotion. Throughout their appearances they constantly argue and reconcile with each other over inane reasons. They claim to eat humans but there is no evidence regarding the same. They can combine to form a single full size demon. This demon wears a green and red garb. Their power is insignificant when they are separated but when they both combine they become as physically strong as a full-fledged demon. Not much is shown regarding any psychic powers they possess.\n\n; Kashtak\nDuring an archaeological dig in the ''qila''(fort) at Bhangdu Khati, the lead archaeologist Prof. Hussain and his assistant Hema discover a sarcophagus and a mysteriously untarnished sword made out of an unknown metal in the ruins. Hema accidentally opens the sarcophagus and unleashes Kashtak, a servant of Tamraj Kilvish. Kashtak used to terrorise the world and was imprisoned nearly 2500 years ago by the curse of Komalatha, a lady sage. [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]] turns out to be the reincarnation of Komalatha. His sword ''Khadgi'' has many powers imbued in them such as telekinesis, petrification and resurrection and control of his army. In the series it is enhanced with the power of mind control by Tamraj. When he controls the mind of a scientist to create a weapon of mass destruction, Shaktimaan stops him .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVda1QKR54s|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 30|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Kekda Man\nKekda man (Crab man) is one of the two dangerous clones of Dr. Jackal (along with Jonk Jonkaa). He is a clone created by Dr. Jackal by fusing cells of crab and a kidnapped Suryanshi. Dr. Jackal managed to twist the mind of the pure Suryanshi to become the Kekda man. He can breathe fire which contains an extremely dangerous poison that even impeded Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan left an illusion of him behind and narrowly escaped. Because he returns with only the illusion, Kekda man is destroyed by his short tempered creator.\n\n; Jonk Jonkaa\nJonk (leech) is one of the two most dangerous clones of Dr. Jackal (along with Kekda Man); He was created by fusing genes of humans and alien leech from Mars. He has the power to eat any form of matter and grow larger in size. He was killed by Geeta and the campers using salt. Shaktimaan is however captured in a flying prison in the process.\n\n; Evil clone Shaktimaan\nAfter capturing Shaktimaan, Dr. Jackal makes a clone of him, but twists his mind to be a servant of darkness. The evil clone is created stronger than Shaktimaan, and is unleashed on the world. When the real Shaktimaan escapes his prison, he challenges the evil clone to a fight. He then captures the clone and sends him into deep space.\n\n; Shalaka\nShalaka is a cat girl who has pledged to eliminate Shaktimaan. She first appears in episode 125 of the series in which she tries to harm Geeta. She is an accomplice of Tamraj Kilvish. She has a sister named Shaliyaa. When she sees the cat Mani caressing Shaktimaan, she hurls it to death. She later realises that the cat was her sister, Shaliyaa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shaktimaan.org/category/episodes-121-130/|work=Episode list|publisher=Shatkimaan.org|accessdate=22 March 2012|title=shaktimaansite|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704094512/http://www.shaktimaan.org/category/episodes-121-130/|archive-date=4 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n; Teemiraa\nShe was another devil magician sent by Tamraaj to kill Shaktimaan in childhood but she failed.

Since then, greed and hatred has taken over humanity and has been deteriorating it for past 6000 years. To end this, a mystical sect of saints known as \"Suryanshis\" chose a man to rise up against all odds and defeat the evil prevailing within society. He was taught the way to energise the 7 chakras of body through Kundalini Yoga that helped him get mystical and supernatural powers. During his training, he also conducted the ritual of death in order to get total control over his powers by entering the holy fire and immersing his physical body in it. When the five natural elements of life, fire, earth, water, wind and sky invigorated his body, he gains superpowers and becomes a [[Superhuman]]. At last, he takes a pledge to finish corruption and injustice in society and fight the evil prevailing in the world. Due to his heroic initial works, he is named Shaktimaan by a reporter, [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. Later, it is revealed that\nShaktimaan was the rebirth of Shri Satya who was part of the Suryanshi Sect during the Mahabharata era 5,000 years ago.\n\nHis alter-ego is a funny geek named Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri, who works as a photographer in a daily newspaper office to maintain his secret identity as Shaktimaan and speaks pure [[Hindi]].\n\nShaktimaan's nemesis is Tamraj Kilvish, who is the living embodiment of the evil and dark forces of the world.\n\nShaktimaan is another common human being, but reincarnation of Shri Satya, but has got his internal spiritual powers ignited with the continuous and typical practice of [[Hindu Philosophy|Hindu philosophical]] and cultural values system and activities like [[Yoga|Yog Sadhna]] and [[Meditation]]. Also, he follows the morals and ethical values of truth, non-violence, and values stated in books like the [[Bhagavad Gita]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mukesh Khanna]] as Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri / Shaktimaan, Major Ranjeet Singh (Shaktimaan's Father), Shree Satya (Previous Incarnation of Shaktimaan), Evil Clone Shaktimaan\n* [[Kitu Gidwani]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 1-16)\n* [[Vaishnavi Mahant]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 16-520)\n* [[Surendra Pal]] as Tamraj Kilvish / Guru Sarvagya\n* [[Tom Alter]] as Mahaguru\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]] as Dr. Jaikaal\n* [[Arun Bakshi]] as Dr. Jaikaal (in last few episodes)\n* Raman Khatri as Sahab / Kumar Ranjan\n* Sharad Smart as Satyaprakash Nirala, the 1st editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Raju Shrivastav]] as Durandhar Singh, the 2nd editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Manjeet Kullar]] as Kaushalya / Maharani Shavalika, Shaktimaan's biological mother\n* [[Ashwini Kalsekar]] as Shalaaka / Kaali Billi\n* [[Dolly Minhas]] as Shaliyaa / Safed Billi, elder sister and guardian of Shalaaka\n* [[Kishore Bhanushali]] as Naurangee the thief\n* [[Rajendra Gupta]] as Prof. Vishwas, paranormal scientist, Geeta Vishwas's father.\n* Jay Mishra as Ghosh Babu\n* [[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as Mayor JJ \"Jai Kumar Janardhan\" / Kakodar\n* [[Deepshikha Nagpal]] as Paroma and Sheraali (dual roles)\n* Sunila Karambelkar as Queen Mayaadri and Natasha in starting episodes\n* Brij Mohan Pandey as Bankelal / Toyman\n* Sanjeev Chaddha as Shudhanshu ji\n* Ajit Mehra as Shwami Ji\n* [[Arun Bali]] as Dayal Chopra, Businessman and owner of Aaj Ki Awaz\n* [[Zahida Parveen]] as Nisha Saluja, reporter who replaced Geeta at Aaj Ki Awaz\n* Hemal Dharia as Hemal\n* Sharad Smart as Satya Prakash Nirala\n* Urmila Amar as Leela Lautekar\n*[[Nupur Alankar]] as Kaamini, Film gossip writer at ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Shikha Swaroop]] as Alien (special appearance)\n* [[Goga Kapoor]] as Bilas Rao\n* Zeena Bhatia as Matandeeka Witch\n* [[Deepraj Rana]] as Inspector Jai Singh, a Corrupt Police officer.\n* [[Urvashi Dholakia]] as Maansi Sharma\n* Annu Kashyap as Teemira / Behroopia\n* [[Neelam Mehra]] as Maansi\n* Shravani Goswami as Shalini (Bengali Bahu)\n* Durgesh Nandini as Rachna (Punjabi Bahu)\n* Manav Sohal as Shalini's husband\n\n== Production ==\n''Shaktimaan'' was conceptualised by Khanna in 1981, when he was working on a film with [[Rajshri Productions]]. He narrated the idea to producer Rajkumar Barjatya, who liked it, and the two adapted it into a film titled ''Akash''. In November 1997, ''[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]]'' reported quoted him: \"I would watch my nephew sitting glued to the TV whenever ''Power Zone'' came on, shooting with imaginary [[laser guns]], or operating some imaginary hi-fi gadget in his own little world. That's when it struck me that if I made ''Shaktimaan'' I would have a readymade audience of kids who are always most impressed with [[Special effects|SFX]] tricks.\" Over the development of the titular character, Khanna said, \"In Indian mythology there are a lot of strong characters but no super-heroes. All we get to see are [[Superman]] or [[Spider-Man|Spiderman]], who are alien concepts. That's why I decided to create an Indian super-hero, Shaktimaan, who is born out of a [[yagna]], and a result of all the creative energies of the universe. A superhero who can fly...disappear.

They are followers of the star ''Sun''. As part of training, he trained with [[Kundalini Yoga]] to awake the 7 chakras of body and gain 'supernatural' powers from them. To gain complete control over his powers he performed the ritual of death. However, this did not cause death but made him more alive than when he was a normal man. He also performed [[Yajna]] in which he entered the fire himself and dissolved his body in fire. Then, the five elements of life, i.e. fire, wind, water, earth, sky revived his body giving him special powers from them. Thus after leaving his mortal body he was given a superhuman form to fight against the evil in the world as Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgrZ2ofIcT8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 1|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Shaktimaan was created he set out to destroy his archenemy Kilvish. But, as the Mahaguru ([[Tom Alter]]) explained, Kilvish can only be defeated after evil is destroyed. Shaktimaan's mission is to destroy the sin within people, not the sinned people. Shaktimaan's adventures show him pursuing justice and saving his friends while Kilvish and his minions plot to defeat him.\n\n=== Powers ===\nShaktimaan has superhuman powers which lie inside his body in his seven chakras of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] attained through meditation. Shaktimaan worships God through the symbol [[Om]]. Truthfulness is his motto. He can even separate his body into five different bodies of fire, wind, water, earth and sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuTDNEmCzB8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 43|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> He is an expert, skilled and intelligent fighter and has fought with super-skilled enemies. He possesses physical powers like unlimited speed (up to the speed of light), strength, durability as well as psychic powers like telepathy, teleportation, telekinesis etc.\nAlthough he possesses godlike powers, his only weakness is a crystal (Papmani) possessed by Tamraj Kilvish which can be used to defeat and even kill him. This makes him powerless because it is filled with the evil of the world and is the source of the black powers. But he regains his strength after the crystal is taken away from him. He can be killed if the crystal is placed in front of him and he is treated violently to the verge of death. Shaktimaan also gets brief premonitions about the incidents that are going to happen to him in future. This can be observed in kashtak's episode, Geeta going to jail and in kapala's reappearance episodes.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cuwX6vm8dqw | title = Shaktimaan episode 172}}</ref>\n\nShaktimaan's powers are virtually limitless. He can do practically anything he imagines. The only limit to his powers is his own belief in himself and his knowledge of how to manifest his powers. His powers come from his chakras. (Note: Although we'll call them chakras in the vedas, in the series dialogue they will also be called energy centers.)\n\nThe seven chakras in his body which give him powers are:\n* Energy Chakra (1): This chakra gives Shaktimaan super strength enabling him to fly, shoot fire from his hands, emit rays from his fingertips, blow a stream of freezing air, or send out protective force fields which nothing can penetrate (provided he can maintain his willpower and not give in). Shaktimaan's strength allows him to physically penetrate anything and lift any object.\n* Creative Chakra (2): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to manifest things out of thin air.\n* Astral Chakra (3): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control his astral body (a semi-transparent, ethereal duplicate of himself) which can fly, walk through walls, see inside objects, etc.\n* Heart Chakra (4): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control the will of others, but only for good. He can will people to do the right thing, see the error in their ways. This power is most useful when Shaktimaan needs to stop someone who is under the control of Kilvish from doing evil.\n* Vibration Chakra (5): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control all types of vibrations, including sound waves, light waves, healing warmth, etc. He can also use it to hear ultrasonic sounds, and can speed up the vibrations of his own atoms allowing him to transport himself in space or time. This can be very useful for getting out of dangerous situations.\n* Psychic Chakra (6): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power of the \"third eye\" which enables him to read minds and see anywhere in the world at any distance. He can sense impending danger and see things at any corner of the world.\n\nThe source of power of Shaktimaan is Kundalini,\n\nThere are seven chakras in the Kundalini\n\n* 1. Muladhar Chakra *\n\nThis gives control over the Earth element.\n\nPhysical force like gravitation, gravitational force etc.\n\n*2. Swadhishthan *\n\nWater element control\n\nJalajgraman, living in water, fearlessness etc.\n\n* 3 Manipura Chakra *\n\nFire control\n\nComplete knowledge of yoga, without living water, food or living of air, travel by sky, journey of invisibility, velocity equal to light, knowledge of all languages, knowledge of languages of birds and tree plants\n\nNature control such as climate climatic earthquake, leadership capacity, hypnotism, meditation, removal of all types of rays such as xray vision, medicine as well as knowledge of Ayurveda\n\n* 4. [[Anahata (Heart Chakra)|Anahata Chakra]] *\n\nAir control\n\nNirvikalpa Samadhi, Proximity to Brahma, Trikalagalyta, Doordarshan, Kalnagna, Time Control, such as Time Travel\n\nTelepathy, foreign entry (entering the living or dead body of another)\n\nKnowledge of the action of cosmic intersection, going into different planets, stars, realms, and multiverse, entering 26 dimensions, watching the above-mentioned places from a distance\n\nTo see the invisible, the philosophy of Goddesses, rejuvenation, attracting all, the pace of mind, the meditation and manifestation,\n\nHypnotism\n\n* 5 vishuddh chakra *\n\nSky control\n\nThe establishment of Saraswati, which has knowledge of ancient and modern science\n\nThe ability to betray, curse and boast\nKnowledge of entire texts\nLiterature composition, stream flow discourse,\nSong music and dance art\nTo hold many bodies like yours or different\n\nOn the other hand, Hanuman ji swallowed the sun upon the desire to make the body bigger by the desire.\n\nKnowing the subtle mysteries of the universe,\n\nRevealing any substance from zero, turning one thing into another,\n\nChange of form, philosophy of brahman\n\nEuthanasia (immortality), hypnosis and hipnotism\n\n* 6. Agya chakra *\n\nControl over the whole universe\n\nDevour someone\n\nAwakening of ternate\n\nTo give someone infinite powers, to make their own, to make the unsuccessful success, to remove all types of rays, such as power rays, xray vision, becoming like God, attaining Brahmana\n\n* 7. Sahasrara Chakra *\n\nControl over entire universes (multiverses)\n\nAbility to compose, follow, and destroy the universe\n\nTo be equal to Parabrahma, infinite power, nature is adorned for obedience\n\n=== Personal life ===\nTo avoid being an easy prey of Tamraj Kilvish, Shaktimaan adopted a different identity as\nPandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri in the society. The character Gangadhar is completely opposite to that of Shaktimaan in all aspects e.g. appearance, intelligence while he speaks pure [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. Whenever he gets any important job to do, he says that he has written a book on it which had never been published. Staying in the society as a common person helped him to get knowledge about crime. He got a job of a photographer for the newspaper ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' after being interviewed by [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. After a few weeks, he became a co-reporter working with Geeta. Through a series of incidents and the fact that he could never capture a photo of Shaktimaan, Geeta came to know about the dual identity of Shaktimaan, which was previously known only to Suryanshis. After ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, Gangadhar became a Hindi professor at a junior college. Later, he left the college to work for a news channel ''KR TV'' with Geeta.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n\n==== Geeta Vishwas ====\nGeeta Vishwas ([[Vaishnavi Mahant]], previously [[Kitu Gidwani]]), the female lead in the serial, used to work as a brave news reporter in ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''. She was the first to report about Shaktimaan in newspaper and named the superhero as ''Shaktimaan''. Incidentally, she was the only reporter to get interviews of Shaktimaan as Gangadhar used to accompany her as photographer in missions. She died in a crash planned by Dr. Jackal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0r8M4plt9c|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 101|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> As Shaktimaan loved her, he brought her back to life again using his power which resulted in losing his powers temporarily due to his ''against the nature actions''. Geeta came to know about this after Shaktimaan regained power with the vow that he will never repeat the same mistake again. To ensure this, she planned to leave the country. In the lead up to that situation, she got to know about Shaktimaan's dual character for the third time. But unlike first two occasions, Shaktimaan didn't erase it from Geeta's memory this time as she promised to keep it secret forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y8GUm3-UbA|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 109|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOne year later<sup>\u2021</sup>, after ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, its staff members persuaded Geeta in returning to India to join them to release Shaktimaan comics. Later she teamed up with Gangadhar again and joined ''KR TV''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtPBVkdn6Yc&list|title=shaktimaan 22 12 2010 0002|publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> as a television reporter while working for the comics simultaneously.\n\n<sup>\u2021</sup>&nbsp;\u2013 ''When the journalist character Geeta Vishwas was written out of the series, fan protests prompted the producers to bring her back.''<ref name=interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/interviews/actor/vaishnavi.htm |title=An Interview with vaishnavi Mahant |publisher=Indiantelevision.com |date=12 October 2001 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Enemies ===\n\n==== Main enemies ====\n; Jackal and Kilvish\nTamraj Kilvish is Shaktimaan's archenemy. Tamraj means King of Darkness (''tama'' = darkness, ''raj'' = king). He has lived 6000 years and is the source of evil in the world. He intends to rule the world by spreading darkness, hatred, sin and evil. It is said that the source of his strength is one-half of the \"Shakti Punj\" (the half which is referred to as \"shaktiman\") which he managed to retain after he originally obtained the entire Shakti Punj by deceit from Shri Satya (Satya means truth), the founder of the Suryavanshi. However, it is also mentioned that the source of his strength is the evil that is committed by people in this world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB9JLeGRUIk|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 70|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt was later revealed that only Shri Satya can kill Tamraj Kilvish. After a death-defying adventure, Shaktimaan was told that he is the rebirth of Shri Satya. Shri Satya had given the exact time of the child's birth and the place before he died about 6000 years ago. Tamraj also knows this and this is the main reason he is frightened by the appearance of Shaktimaan as he knows that only Shaktimaan can kill Tamraj. He murdered Shaktimaan's parents and his adoptive father, Pandit Vidyadhar Shastri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/shakti.htm |title=International Hero&nbsp;\u2013 Shaktimaan |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> He and his minions plot to kill him but always fail. His minions include Electric-man (who can shoot lightning bolts from his body), Stone-man (who can shoot stones from his body), Plastica (who can stretch any part of her body), Dr. Jackal (an evil scientist) and others. Dr. Jackal has helped Kilvish in his various schemes by cloning Shaktimaan and also by turning aliens against him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |newspaper=Indian Express |title=Bad Boys |date=21 June 2006 |author=Tushar Abhichandani |accessdate=23 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919194526/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |archivedate=19 September 2006  }}</ref>\n\nIn the television series, Kilvish is often treated as the personification of darkness itself even though he was once a human being who later becomes very powerful and commits many evil deeds. In an attempt to become immortal, he left his mortal body and took an ethereal body which can't be killed but Shaktimaan is told that he has to kill all the evil in the world to destroy Tamraj's ethereal body. Kilvish's trademark quote is \"Andhera Kaayam Rahe\" (May Darkness Prevail), which is also used by his followers.\n\nKilvish's character evolves as the series progresses. In the beginning episodes of Shaktimaan, his face is never shown and his voice is different from the voice that he uses in the later episodes of Shaktimaan, in which his role is played by [[Surendra Pal]]. Later his face deforms to become a distorted wolf-like face.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bakwaasbybiswas.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/kilwis.jpg|title=Bakwaas by Biswas (WordPress blog)|accessdate= 13 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Dr. Jackal\nDr. Jackal is an evil scientist who works for Kilvish. His earlier intention was not that of becoming evil, but when he was denied scholarship for research, Kilvish provided him with funds and labs, thus making him a supporter of Kilvish & an evil scientist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iof2Ce4egp8|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 224|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\nThough he is overall a brilliant scientist, his specialisation is cloning and various energy rays.\nHis creations against Shaktimaan include Kekda Man (a clone formed by fusing cells of Crab & human), followed by Jonk Jonkaa (a clone using leech), an evil clone of Shaktimaan, Plastica,\nLightman, 3D image, Super-heroine Sunanda and others. He also invented a height control solution and fictional EC- rays.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l14zW_E1VzI|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 120|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83uDEE69YlY|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 28|publisher=YouTube.com 3 |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buecO_bwsls|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 301|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-lG6uoeh7E|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 162|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVVTrBXe18s|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 38|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJf6yZZdkes|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 41 |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDNhyZ5abCE|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 42 |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Sahab\nSahab is an organised criminal and drug lord. Like Shaktimaan he also possesses double identity, the other being that of a law-abiding industrialist and Mayor, known as Kumar Ranjan. Except for Tamraj Kilvish (and later Dr. Jackal), no one knows that Sahab and Kumar Ranjan are the same person, thus making this his biggest strength. Through his criminal mind, Sahab keeps plotting ways to create trouble for Shaktimaan or to defame him and to find out about the real identity of Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsseb6UtzyA&list|title=shaktimaan 10 1 2011 0002|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Other enemies ====\n; Kakodar\nKakodar is a sorcerer with the visage of a devil who was imprisoned in a statue nearly five hundred years ago. He could only be freed if a good person removes a thread from his neck. It is unclear whether he was cursed by an enemy or punished by Tamraj to end up imprisoned. In the present day, the mayor of Mumbai, Jai Kumar Janardhan a.k.a. JJ (Nawab Shah) was deceived by his personal assistant Mathur (Deepak Bhatia) to break the thread and free him. Mayor JJ died in shock at seeing Kakodar's true form. As instructed by Madhur, Kakodar possessed JJ's body and decided to spread ''Andhera'' (darkness).\n\nHe was the primary super villain in the first part of the series as he uses JJ's wealth and power to hatch plots to kill Shaktimaan but always failed. Unlike most of other assailants of Shaktimaan, he is very sharp and analytical. He even tries to approach Tarendra, an all knowing sentient being of light, to know the truth about Shaktimaan. He is cunning enough to be able to use mental manipulation to trick Shaktimaan on occasion. This put the hero into a dilemma, and self-doubt drained him of his powers temporarily.\n\nThe full extent of his powers is not revealed. On an occasion, JJ's girlfriend Zuby realises that JJ is possessed by a demon and tries to reveal him in public. He uses hypnosis to drive her mad so that the public will ignore her statements. He has a potent and fatal poison inside him that he can spit out of his mouth which affects everyone except Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan and Kakodar end things in a fight when Kakodar turns into his real form and Shaktimaan turns him back to a statue.\n\n; Natasha\nNatasha (Sunila) was also a demonic evil woman sent by Kilvish. Along with Mathur she serves JJ/Kakodar. She was JJ's secretary before he was possessed. She has the ability to change her appearance. She kills a C.B.I. officer and takes her appearance to interrogate Gangadhar and Geeta on one occasion. Her powers were greatly diminished due to Shaktimaan defeating Kakodar. To regain power she and Madhur decide to sacrifice Shaktimaan. For this they kidnap the son of a scientist to get the formula of ''invisible man'' which may help defeating Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dHANSmJg6A|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 24 |publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Madhur\nMadhur (Deepak Bhatia) is one of the two trusted demonic accomplices of JJ/Kakodar along with Natasha. He initially served JJ as his personal assistant (PA) before he was possessed, but was secretly preparing the stage for Kakodar's entry under Tamraj's directions. His true identity is revealed after Kakodar is released from his imprisonment. Not many of his powers are revealed in the series. He has the ability to change his appearance at will, but not shape shift to assume someone else's body. He also loses his powers when Kakodar was defeated by Shaktimaan.\n\n; Electric-man\nHe was the first synthetic villain faced by Shaktimaan. Dr. Chandola, an evil scientist, created him. Dr. Chandola claims that Electric man was his son, whom he killed so that he can resurrect the dead body with electricity. When he comes to life he kills Dr. Chandola. Without recognising friend from foe he kills everyone in his path and spreads destruction in the city. His powers include shooting electricity from eyes and electrocution on contact. Finding him difficult to restrain, Shaktimaan grabs him and tunnels deep into the earth, pushing him deep underground.\n\n; Kapala\nKapala is a corrupted tantrik who serves Tamraj Kilvish. His primary skill is his shape shifting to inanimate objects such as vehicles and weapons. He also has many other magical devices and servants under his control. One such device is metal plate he wears around his neck that has the power to steal his opponent's strength. The villain Stone man was created from his magic skull. Shaktimaan destroys both the metal plate and the magic skull. He has an odd sense of humor as he makes jokes while fighting Shaktimaan. There are occasions where he serves as a comic relief. This is in contrast to other villains who are stark and serious. He also has a very fragile ego and falls victim to taunts. His main accessory is a trident. Shaktimaan eventually turns him into stone and shatters him at one instance. However, in later episodes of Shaktimaan, he is shown resurrected back to life. He is played by Faqira.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41PAj7P6qKk&list|title=shaktimaan 28 12 2010 0003|publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUChETYxkQo|title=shaktimaan 8 12 2010 0001 |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Khali-Bali\nKhali and Bali are two dwarvish green and red imps. Their names originate from the Urdu word Khalbali which means commotion. Throughout their appearances they constantly argue and reconcile with each other over inane reasons. They claim to eat humans but there is no evidence regarding the same. They can combine to form a single full size demon. This demon wears a green and red garb. Their power is insignificant when they are separated but when they both combine they become as physically strong as a full-fledged demon. Not much is shown regarding any psychic powers they possess.\n\n; Kashtak\nDuring an archaeological dig in the ''qila''(fort) at Bhangdu Khati, the lead archaeologist Prof. Hussain and his assistant Hema discover a sarcophagus and a mysteriously untarnished sword made out of an unknown metal in the ruins. Hema accidentally opens the sarcophagus and unleashes Kashtak, a servant of Tamraj Kilvish. Kashtak used to terrorise the world and was imprisoned nearly 2500 years ago by the curse of Komalatha, a lady sage. [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]] turns out to be the reincarnation of Komalatha. His sword ''Khadgi'' has many powers imbued in them such as telekinesis, petrification and resurrection and control of his army. In the series it is enhanced with the power of mind control by Tamraj. When he controls the mind of a scientist to create a weapon of mass destruction, Shaktimaan stops him .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVda1QKR54s|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 30|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Kekda Man\nKekda man (Crab man) is one of the two dangerous clones of Dr. Jackal (along with Jonk Jonkaa). He is a clone created by Dr. Jackal by fusing cells of crab and a kidnapped Suryanshi. Dr. Jackal managed to twist the mind of the pure Suryanshi to become the Kekda man. He can breathe fire which contains an extremely dangerous poison that even impeded Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan left an illusion of him behind and narrowly escaped. Because he returns with only the illusion, Kekda man is destroyed by his short tempered creator.\n\n; Jonk Jonkaa\nJonk (leech) is one of the two most dangerous clones of Dr. Jackal (along with Kekda Man); He was created by fusing genes of humans and alien leech from Mars. He has the power to eat any form of matter and grow larger in size. He was killed by Geeta and the campers using salt. Shaktimaan is however captured in a flying prison in the process.\n\n; Evil clone Shaktimaan\nAfter capturing Shaktimaan, Dr. Jackal makes a clone of him, but twists his mind to be a servant of darkness. The evil clone is created stronger than Shaktimaan, and is unleashed on the world. When the real Shaktimaan escapes his prison, he challenges the evil clone to a fight. He then captures the clone and sends him into deep space.\n\n; Shalaka\nShalaka is a cat girl who has pledged to eliminate Shaktimaan. She first appears in episode 125 of the series in which she tries to harm Geeta. She is an accomplice of Tamraj Kilvish. She has a sister named Shaliyaa. When she sees the cat Mani caressing Shaktimaan, she hurls it to death. She later realises that the cat was her sister, Shaliyaa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shaktimaan.org/category/episodes-121-130/|work=Episode list|publisher=Shatkimaan.org|accessdate=22 March 2012|title=shaktimaansite|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704094512/http://www.shaktimaan.org/category/episodes-121-130/|archive-date=4 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n; Teemiraa\nShe was another devil magician sent by Tamraaj to kill Shaktimaan in childhood but she failed.

It was originally published in the magazine ''[[Thrilling Wonder Stories]]'' in August 1949, under the title \"The Naming of Names\". It was subsequently included in the short-story collections ''[[A Medicine for Melancholy]]'' and ''[[S is for Space]]''.\n\nThe story takes place in the near future on [[Mars]], as is the case with many of Bradbury's stories.\n\n==Plot summary==\nDONT USE THIS INFO PEOPLE CAN RANDOMLY EDIT THIS DO NOT USE THIS!!!\nIn the midst of an atomic war on Earth, the United States sends a number of colonists to establish an outpost on Mars. The Bittering family, father Harry and mother Cora and their children Dan, Laura, and David, arrives as part of the eight hundred colonists chosen for the first wave. Harry is initially disquieted by the Martian environment, but takes comfort in the fact that the family can return to Earth when resupply ships arrive. \n\nStrange events begin to affect the life brought as part of the settlement effort, including the seeded grass sprouting purple, the family cow growing a third horn in the middle of its head, and other anomalies with the vegetable garden. Harry's discomfort on Mars increases, and the thought of returning to Earth on the next resupply mission soon becomes his only comfort, much to the concern of Cora. This comfort is taken away as Bittering is informed that the war has led to an atomic bomb devastating New York City and destroying the only spaceport capable of supporting travel to Mars. \n\nResolving to build himself a rocket home, Harry isolates himself from his family and the townsfolk, who have begun to show signs of transforming into Martians as their limbs and bodies elongate, their irises become shimmery gold, their skin darkens, and they begin using Martian language, referring to Earth as Iorrt, the ancient Martian name for Earth. Harry staves off the transformation as he only consumes food and water brought from Earth, but the supplies run out and he is forced to eat Martian food to survive. Soon enough, Harry notices his eyes have turned gold. Cows are growing 3 horns.\n\nCora convinces Harry that a family swim in the canals of Mars would do him good to relax, and he hesitantly agrees. While there, their eldest son, Dan, requests to be referred to by the Martian name Linnl. Harry and Cora, now almost entirely Martian, agree easily, and the other two children quickly adopt Martian names as well. As they return to the town, the Bitterings discover that the colonists are retreating to the ancient Martian villas in the mountains, as the summer has made the valley stiflingly hot. Harry briefly expresses a wish to stay and work on his rocket, but is easily persuaded to go with the rest of the colonists and come back when the weather is cooler.\n\nFive years later, the United States, having won the war and rebuilt New York, sends a small military dispatch to recover the colonists sent to Mars, only to find their settlement abandoned. The soldiers instead encounter a large Martian settlement in the mountain villas, where the native Martians are pleasant and have a remarkable affinity for English. Convinced they had nothing to do with the original colony's disappearance, the group agrees to attempt a second, larger settlement using the town built by the first.\n\n==Legacy==\nThere was a [[Dark They Were(bookshop)|bookshop]] of the same name.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Isfdb title|id=64806}}\n\n{{Ray Bradbury|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:1949 short stories]]\n[[Category:Short stories by Ray Bradbury]]\n[[Category:Science fiction short stories]]\n[[Category:Works originally published in Wonder Stories]]\n[[Category:Mars in fiction]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the Ray Bradbury short story|the world science fiction bookshop|Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed (bookshop)}}\n'''\"Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed\"''' is a science fiction   [[short story]] by American writer [[Ray Bradbury]].

Harry briefly expresses a wish to stay and work on his rocket, but is easily persuaded to go with the rest of the colonists and come back when the weather is cooler.\n\nFive years later, the United States, having won the war and rebuilt New York, sends a small military dispatch to recover the colonists sent to Mars, only to find their settlement abandoned. The soldiers instead encounter a large Martian settlement in the mountain villas, where the native Martians are pleasant and have a remarkable affinity for English. Convinced they had nothing to do with the original colony's disappearance, the group agrees to attempt a second, larger settlement using the town built by the first.\n\n==Legacy==\nThere was a [[Dark They Were(bookshop)|bookshop]] of the same name.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Isfdb title|id=64806}}\n\n{{Ray Bradbury|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:1949 short stories]]\n[[Category:Short stories by Ray Bradbury]]\n[[Category:Science fiction short stories]]\n[[Category:Works originally published in Wonder Stories]]\n[[Category:Mars in fiction]]\n", "name_user": "67.243.13.135", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePlot summary)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_They_Were,_and_Golden-Eyed"}
