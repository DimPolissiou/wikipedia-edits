Average approval time has been nine days slower for Trump appointees versus Obama's. Ten of 15 Cabinet agencies had no number two, several deputy secretaries were not nominated until after the Administration's 100-day mark, and some had not yet been nominated.<ref>Yourish, Karen, and Gregor Aisch, [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/17/us/politics/trump-appointments.html \"The Top Jobs in Trump\u2019s Administration Are Mostly Vacant: Who\u2019s to Blame?\"], ''New York Times'', July 17, 2017.

It was Bowie's final studio album on the label and his first following the [[Berlin Trilogy]], which consisted of ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'', ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1977\u20131979). Though considered very significant in artistic terms, the trilogy had proven less successful commercially.<ref>David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination&nbsp;\u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': p.302</ref> With ''Scary Monsters'', Bowie achieved what biographer David Buckley called \"the perfect balance\" of creativity and mainstream success.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (1999). pp.363\u2013375</ref>\n\nUpon release, the album garnered critical acclaim and peaked at No. 1 and went Platinum in the UK while successfully restoring Bowie's commercial standing in the US.<ref>[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': p.314</ref><ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': pp.108\u2013114</ref> ''Scary Monsters'' would later be referred to by some biographers as Bowie's \"last great album\" and a benchmark for later releases, although some give this distinction to ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983). The album has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the ''[[A New Career in a New Town (1977\u20131982)]]'' box set.\n\n==Production==\nAccording to co-producer [[Tony Visconti]], David Bowie's method on ''Scary Monsters'' was somewhat less experimental and more concerned with achieving a commercially viable sound than had been the case with his recent releases; to that end the composer spent more time on his own developing lyrics and melodies before recording, rather than improvising music in the studio and making up words at the last minute.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\" /> Aside from one cover, [[Tom Verlaine]]'s \"Kingdom Come\", all tracks would be credited to Bowie alone, unlike the 'Berlin Trilogy' where there was an increasing amount of input from his collaborators.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\nAmong those collaborators, [[Brian Eno]] was no longer present on ''Scary Monsters'', but [[Chuck Hammer]] added multiple textural layers deploying [[guitar synth]] and, following his absence from ''Lodger'', [[Robert Fripp]] returned with the distinctive guitar sound he had earlier lent to ''\"Heroes\"''. [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s pianist [[Roy Bittan]] was back for his first Bowie album since ''[[Station to Station]]'' five years earlier, while [[the Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] guested on \"Because You're Young\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> This would be the fifth and last Bowie album featuring the rhythm section of [[Dennis Davis]], [[Carlos Alomar]] and [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]], which had been together since ''Station to Station''.<ref>David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination&nbsp;\u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': p.270</ref>\n\n==Development==\nBowie continued to develop songs using non-traditional methods: for \"[[It's No Game]] (No. 1)\", he challenged guitarist Fripp to \"imagine he was playing a guitar duel with [[B.B. King]] where he had to out-B.B. B.B., but do it in his own way.\"<ref name=GuitarPlayer97>Joe Gore, \"Changes 2.1\" , ''Guitar Player'' magazine, June 1997, pp. 45\u201358</ref>\n\n\"We were doing either 'Up the Hill Backwards' or 'It's No Game', and I said, 'Any suggestions?'\" Fripp recalled. \"And David replied, \"[[Ritchie Blackmore]]!\" Because David isn't really a guitarist, he couldn't give me more of a ground plan than that, but I knew what he meant.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Rob|last=Hughes|title=Prog? It's a prison|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]|date=February 2015|p=73}}</ref>\n\n\"Fashion\" began as \"Jamaica\". Unable to think of anything to write, Bowie discarded the song until late in the recording cycle, when it was transformed into the song that appears on the album. Other tracks also began with different names: \"Ashes to Ashes\" as \"People Are Turning to Gold\", \"Teenage Wildlife\" as \"It Happens Everyday\" and \"Scream Like a Baby\" as \"Laser\" (the lyric \"Scream like a baby\" was sung as \"I am a laser\"). \"Laser\" was originally written in 1973, recorded by Ava Cherry and the Astronettes (made up of Bowie collaborators Ava Cherry and Geoff MacCormack), and [[demo (music)|demoed]] by Bowie during the sessions for \"[[Young Americans]]\" in 1975. \"Is There Life After Marriage?\" was fully written and recorded for the album, but, for unknown reasons, never released.<ref name=SIDC>{{citation |title=David Bowie: The Starzone Interviews |editor=David Currie |isbn=978-0-7119-0685-3 |location=England |year=1985 |publisher=Omnibus Press}}</ref> This track is a rough instrumental demo cover of \"[[I Feel Free]]\" (by [[Cream (band)|Cream]]), which later appeared, rerecorded, on 1993's ''[[Black Tie White Noise]]''.\n\n==Style and themes==\nThe public's first taste of ''Scary Monsters'' was \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\", which was released as a single one month prior to the album and made No. 1 in the UK. Built around a guitar synth theme by [[Chuck Hammer]], it revisited the character of [[Major Tom]] from Bowie's early hit \"[[Space Oddity]]\". Aside from its critical and commercial success as a song, the accompanying music video set a benchmark for the art form.<ref>Nicholas Pegg (2000). p.29</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding the lush textures of \"Ashes to Ashes\", Bowie's sound on the album was described by critics as being harsher\u2014and his worldview more desperate\u2014than anything he had released since ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' (1974).<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\" /> This was exemplified by such tracks as \"[[It's No Game]] (No. 1)\", the hard-rocking opener featuring lead female vocals in Japanese; the careering [[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (song)|title track]] with its prominent percussion effects and Bowie's [[cockney]] accent; the second single \"[[Fashion (David Bowie song)|Fashion]]\", which seemed to draw parallels between style and politics and which had its own highly regarded video;<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\" /> and \"[[Scream Like a Baby]]\", a tale of [[political prisoner|political imprisonment]].<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\nIn \"Teenage Wildlife\", against a musical backdrop that owed much to his song [[Heroes (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]], Bowie was variously thought to be taking aim squarely at [[New wave music|new wave]] artists such as [[Gary Numan]],<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\" /> or reflecting on his younger self:<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\n:A broken-nosed mogul are you\n:One of the new wave boys\n:Same old thing in brand new [[drag (clothing)|drag]]\n:Comes sweeping into view\n:As ugly as a teenage millionaire\n:Pretending it's a whiz-kid world\n\n==Packaging==\n[[Image:ScaryMonstersBackCover.jpg|thumb|right|The rear sleeve contained references to four of Bowie's earlier albums.]]\n\nThe [[cover artwork]] of ''Scary Monsters'' is a collage by [[Edward Bell (artist)|Edward Bell]] featuring Bowie in the [[Pierrot]] costume worn in the \"Ashes to Ashes\" music video, along with [[Brian Duffy (photographer)|Brian Duffy]] photographs. The original [[Gramophone record|vinyl album]]'s rear sleeve referred to four earlier albums, namely the immediately preceding 'Berlin Trilogy' and 1973's ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'', the latter also having been designed and photographed by Duffy. The cover images from ''Low'', ''\"Heroes\"'', and ''Lodger''\u2014the last showing Bowie's torso superimposed on the figure from ''Aladdin Sane'''s inside gatefold picture\u2014were portrayed in small frames to the left of the track listing.

The album's final single, \"[[Up the Hill Backwards]]\", was released in March of that year. Other songs from this period, released on CD by Rykodisc, included both sides of the single \"[[Alabama Song (Bowie)|Alabama Song]]\" b/w \"Space Oddity\", the latter a stark remake that debuted New Year's Eve 1979 on ''[[The Kenny Everett Video Show]]'' and served as a \"ritualistic purification\"<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\" /> of Bowie's most famous number prior to its demolition with \"Ashes to Ashes\"; \"[[Crystal Japan]]\", B-side of \"Up the Hill Backwards\" in the UK and an A-side b/w \"Alabama Song\" in Japan, where it was also used for a [[Sake]] commercial;<ref

It was Bowie's final studio album on the label and his first following the [[Berlin Trilogy]], which consisted of ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'', ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1977\u20131979). Though considered very significant in artistic terms, the trilogy had proven less successful commercially.<ref>David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination&nbsp;\u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': p.302</ref> With ''Scary Monsters'', Bowie achieved what biographer David Buckley called \"the perfect balance\" of creativity and mainstream success.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (1999). pp.363\u2013375</ref>\n\nUpon release, the album garnered critical acclaim and peaked at No. 1 and went Platinum in the UK while successfully restoring Bowie's commercial standing in the US.<ref>[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': p.314</ref><ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': pp.108\u2013114</ref> ''Scary Monsters'' would later be referred to by some biographers as Bowie's \"last great album\" and a benchmark for later releases, although some give this distinction to ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983). The album has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the ''[[A New Career in a New Town (1977\u20131982)]]'' box set.\n\n==Production==\nAccording to co-producer [[Tony Visconti]], David Bowie's method on ''Scary Monsters'' was somewhat less experimental and more concerned with achieving a commercially viable sound than had been the case with his recent releases; to that end the composer spent more time on his own developing lyrics and melodies before recording, rather than improvising music in the studio and making up words at the last minute.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\" /> Aside from one cover, [[Tom Verlaine]]'s \"Kingdom Come\", all tracks would be credited to Bowie alone, unlike the 'Berlin Trilogy' where there was an increasing amount of input from his collaborators.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\nAmong those collaborators, [[Brian Eno]] was no longer present on ''Scary Monsters'', but [[Chuck Hammer]] added multiple textural layers deploying [[guitar synth]] and, following his absence from ''Lodger'', [[Robert Fripp]] returned with the distinctive guitar sound he had earlier lent to ''\"Heroes\"''. [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s pianist [[Roy Bittan]] was back for his first Bowie album since ''[[Station to Station]]'' five years earlier, while [[the Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] guested on \"Because You're Young\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> This would be the fifth and last Bowie album featuring the rhythm section of [[Dennis Davis]], [[Carlos Alomar]] and [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]], which had been together since ''Station to Station''.<ref>David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination&nbsp;\u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': p.270</ref>\n\n==Development==\nBowie continued to develop songs using non-traditional methods: for \"[[It's No Game]] (No. 1)\", he challenged guitarist Fripp to \"imagine he was playing a guitar duel with [[B.B. King]] where he had to out-B.B. B.B., but do it in his own way.\"<ref name=GuitarPlayer97>Joe Gore, \"Changes 2.1\" , ''Guitar Player'' magazine, June 1997, pp. 45\u201358</ref>\n\n\"We were doing either 'Up the Hill Backwards' or 'It's No Game', and I said, 'Any suggestions?'\" Fripp recalled. \"And David replied, \"[[Ritchie Blackmore]]!\" Because David isn't really a guitarist, he couldn't give me more of a ground plan than that, but I knew what he meant.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Rob|last=Hughes|title=Prog? It's a prison|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]|date=February 2015|p=73}}</ref>\n\n\"Fashion\" began as \"Jamaica\". Unable to think of anything to write, Bowie discarded the song until late in the recording cycle, when it was transformed into the song that appears on the album. Other tracks also began with different names: \"Ashes to Ashes\" as \"People Are Turning to Gold\", \"Teenage Wildlife\" as \"It Happens Everyday\" and \"Scream Like a Baby\" as \"Laser\" (the lyric \"Scream like a baby\" was sung as \"I am a laser\"). \"Laser\" was originally written in 1973, recorded by Ava Cherry and the Astronettes (made up of Bowie collaborators Ava Cherry and Geoff MacCormack), and [[demo (music)|demoed]] by Bowie during the sessions for \"[[Young Americans]]\" in 1975. \"Is There Life After Marriage?\" was fully written and recorded for the album, but, for unknown reasons, never released.<ref name=SIDC>{{citation |title=David Bowie: The Starzone Interviews |editor=David Currie |isbn=978-0-7119-0685-3 |location=England |year=1985 |publisher=Omnibus Press}}</ref> This track is a rough instrumental demo cover of \"[[I Feel Free]]\" (by [[Cream (band)|Cream]]), which later appeared, rerecorded, on 1993's ''[[Black Tie White Noise]]''.\n\n==Style and themes==\nThe public's first taste of ''Scary Monsters'' was \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\", which was released as a single one month prior to the album and made No. 1 in the UK. Built around a guitar synth theme by [[Chuck Hammer]], it revisited the character of [[Major Tom]] from Bowie's early hit \"[[Space Oddity]]\". Aside from its critical and commercial success as a song, the accompanying music video set a benchmark for the art form.<ref>Nicholas Pegg (2000). p.29</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding the lush textures of \"Ashes to Ashes\", Bowie's sound on the album was described by critics as being harsher\u2014and his worldview more desperate\u2014than anything he had released since ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' (1974).<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\" /> This was exemplified by such tracks as \"[[It's No Game]] (No. 1)\", the hard-rocking opener featuring lead female vocals in Japanese; the careering [[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (song)|title track]] with its prominent percussion effects and Bowie's [[cockney]] accent; the second single \"[[Fashion (David Bowie song)|Fashion]]\", which seemed to draw parallels between style and politics and which had its own highly regarded video;<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\" /> and \"[[Scream Like a Baby]]\", a tale of [[political prisoner|political imprisonment]].<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\nIn \"Teenage Wildlife\", against a musical backdrop that owed much to his song [[Heroes (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]], Bowie was variously thought to be taking aim squarely at [[New wave music|new wave]] artists such as [[Gary Numan]],<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\" /> or reflecting on his younger self:<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\n:A broken-nosed mogul are you\n:One of the new wave boys\n:Same old thing in brand new [[drag (clothing)|drag]]\n:Comes sweeping into view\n:As ugly as a teenage millionaire\n:Pretending it's a whiz-kid world\n\n==Packaging==\n[[Image:ScaryMonstersBackCover.jpg|thumb|right|The rear sleeve contained references to four of Bowie's earlier albums.]]\n\nThe [[cover artwork]] of ''Scary Monsters'' is a collage by [[Edward Bell (artist)|Edward Bell]] featuring Bowie in the [[Pierrot]] costume worn in the \"Ashes to Ashes\" music video, along with [[Brian Duffy (photographer)|Brian Duffy]] photographs. The original [[Gramophone record|vinyl album]]'s rear sleeve referred to four earlier albums, namely the immediately preceding 'Berlin Trilogy' and 1973's ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'', the latter also having been designed and photographed by Duffy. The cover images from ''Low'', ''\"Heroes\"'', and ''Lodger''\u2014the last showing Bowie's torso superimposed on the figure from ''Aladdin Sane'''s inside gatefold picture\u2014were portrayed in small frames to the left of the track listing. Their [[whitewash]]ed brushstrokes was reportedly designed \"to symbolise the discarding of Bowie's old personae.\"<ref>[http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/scarymonsters.html ''Scary Monsters'' at BowieGoldenYears].

Retrieved 11 April 2013.</ref>\n\n==Singles and other songs==\nFollowing the release of \"Ashes to Ashes\" in August 1980, prior to the album, and \"Fashion\" in October, the title track was issued as a single in January 1981 in both [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]] and [[compact cassette]] form. The album's final single, \"[[Up the Hill Backwards]]\", was released in March of that year. Other songs from this period, released on CD by Rykodisc, included both sides of the single \"[[Alabama Song (Bowie)|Alabama Song]]\" b/w \"Space Oddity\", the latter a stark remake that debuted New Year's Eve 1979 on ''[[The Kenny Everett Video Show]]'' and served as a \"ritualistic purification\"<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\" /> of Bowie's most famous number prior to its demolition with \"Ashes to Ashes\"; \"[[Crystal Japan]]\", B-side of \"Up the Hill Backwards\" in the UK and an A-side b/w \"Alabama Song\" in Japan, where it was also used for a [[Sake]] commercial;<ref
