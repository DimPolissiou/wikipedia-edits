{"title_page": "Calendar of saints (Church of the Province of Melanesia)", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=January 2007}}\nThe '''[[calendar of saints]] and commemorations in the [[Church of the Province of Melanesia]]''' (the Anglican Church in the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Vanuatu]]) is a continually developing list. Both old and new, universal and local saints and worthies are celebrated.\n\n== Classification of saint's days and commemorations ==\nThere are three main classes of saint's day within the calendar. This classification is based on the reformed scheme of holy day classification used by the Roman Catholic Church from 1965 to 1970.\n\n=== Class I ===\n''Class I'' days are all the Major Holy Days of the Church. All the festivals of our Lord and a few others are Class I. There is always a First [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]] and Second Evensong. Morning Prayer, the Holy Eucharist and the both Evensongs all have proper psalms and lessons appropriate to the day. The Holy Eucharist is sung, and the Creed and Gloria are used. These Major Holy Days are never transferred unless they fall during Holy Week or Easter Week. Baptism, Confirmation, and Ordination are appropriate for these days, but not funerals or weddings. though these frequently occur.\n\nSundays are all Class I Holy Days because they are festivals of our Lord on which we give thanks for the Resurrection of Christ. Therefore, every Saturday evening there is a First Evensong for the Sunday. On Saturday evenings, only the Collect for the next day should be used.\n\n=== Class II ===\n''Class II'' days are all feasts of the apostles and [[Four Evangelists]] and some others. Sometimes there is a First Evensong. There are propers for the day, i.e. appropriate collects, psalms, lessons. The Second Order provides other propers, such as prefaces and blessings, sentences, etc. The Eucharist should be sung and the Creed and the Gloria are used. These also are appropriate for Baptism, Confirmation and Ordination. Weddings and funerals may be held on these days as well.\n\n=== Class III ===\n''Class III'' days are the days for other saints and special days. There are usually no proper psalms and lessons at the Offices or the Eucharist, but a proper collect for the Holy Day may be used (but not in Advent or Lent). The Eucharist is not usually sung. The Gloria may be used (except in Advent and Lent), but not the Creed.\n\n''Local commemorations'' are observed exactly as for Class III.\n\n== Days of special observance ==\nThese are days appointed by church, civil or local authority. They may be recurring or only happen once. Recurring days of special observance include:\n\n* The quarterly [[Ember Days]], days of abstinence and prayer for those in the ministry and for those exploring a vocation to the ordained ministry. They should be marked by abstinence, prayer (including the [[Litany]] for the Ember Days at the Eucharist or the Daily Office), perhaps by special offerings for theological students in the diocese, region, parish or district. The colour is purple\n* The Rogation Days, observed by asking God's blessings on given resources. These days include giving witness to one's faith in the Rogation Procession (procession is purple, the Eucharist is white).\n\nThere are days celebrated by organisations within the church such as the Mothers' Union, the MBH and Companions, the SSF and TSSF, the CSC and Associates, and CSM and Associates, [[Girls Friendly Society]], Melanesian Guild of Servers, Catechist and Lay Preachers Associations, Men's Fellowships, Youth Groups and Sunday Schools, etc. These are to be coordinated with the rector and may be celebrated on free days or Class III days. They may be celebrated on Class II days (or as Class II days) if they are significant to the organisation and do not contravene the tables of precedence above, or overshadow the saint or event celebrated on that day.\n\n== Calendar of saint's days and holy days ==\n''These dates apply unless transferred according to the Rules of Precedence.''\n\n=== January ===\n*1 [[Circumcision of

This full moon may happen on any date between March 21 and April 18 inclusive. If the full moon falls on a Sunday, Easter Day is always the following Sunday, but Easter Day can never be earlier than March 21 or later than April 25.\n:The date of Easter governs the cycle of feasts dependent upon this, the most important feast. The number of Sundays after Epiphany and the number of Sundays after Pentecost depend on the date of Easter.\n*[[Ash Wednesday]] is always the fortieth weekday before Easter.\n*[[Palm Sunday]] is always the Sunday before Easter.\n*[[Holy Week]] is always the week before Easter.\n*[[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] Day is always the fortieth day after Easter.\n*[[Pentecost]] is always the fiftieth day after Easter.\n*[[Advent Sunday]] is always the Sunday closest to Saint Andrew\u2019s Day.\n*The [[Rogation Days]] are always the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday before Ascension Day.\n*The [[Ember Days]] are the Wednesday, Friday and Saturday after the First Sunday in [[Lent]], the Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, after Pentecost, the Wednesday, Friday and Saturday after [[Feast of the Cross|Holy Cross]] Day, and the Wednesday, Friday and Saturday after December 13.\n\n==See also==\n*{{Portal-inline|Christianity}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Calendar of Saints|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Anglican calendars of saints|Melan]]\n[[Category:Melanesia|Anglican]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=January 2007}}\nThe '''[[calendar of saints]] and commemorations in the [[Church of the Province of Melanesia]]''' (the Anglican Church in the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Vanuatu]]) is a continually developing list. Both old and new, universal and local saints and worthies are celebrated.\n\n== Classification of saint's days and commemorations ==\nThere are three main classes of saint's day within the calendar. This classification is based on the reformed scheme of holy day classification used by the Roman Catholic Church from 1965 to 1970.\n\n=== Class I ===\n''Class I'' days are all the Major Holy Days of the Church. All the festivals of our Lord and a few others are Class I. There is always a First [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]] and Second Evensong. Morning Prayer, the Holy Eucharist and the both Evensongs all have proper psalms and lessons appropriate to the day. The Holy Eucharist is sung, and the Creed and Gloria are used. These Major Holy Days are never transferred unless they fall during Holy Week or Easter Week. Baptism, Confirmation, and Ordination are appropriate for these days, but not funerals or weddings. though these frequently occur.\n\nSundays are all Class I Holy Days because they are festivals of our Lord on which we give thanks for the Resurrection of Christ. Therefore, every Saturday evening there is a First Evensong for the Sunday. On Saturday evenings, only the Collect for the next day should be used.\n\n=== Class II ===\n''Class II'' days are all feasts of the apostles and [[Four Evangelists]] and some others. Sometimes there is a First Evensong. There are propers for the day, i.e. appropriate collects, psalms, lessons. The Second Order provides other propers, such as prefaces and blessings, sentences, etc. The Eucharist should be sung and the Creed and the Gloria are used. These also are appropriate for Baptism, Confirmation and Ordination. Weddings and funerals may be held on these days as well.\n\n=== Class III ===\n''Class III'' days are the days for other saints and special days. There are usually no proper psalms and lessons at the Offices or the Eucharist, but a proper collect for the Holy Day may be used (but not in Advent or Lent). The Eucharist is not usually sung. The Gloria may be used (except in Advent and Lent), but not the Creed.\n\n''Local commemorations'' are observed exactly as for Class III.\n\n== Days of special observance ==\nThese are days appointed by church, civil or local authority. They may be recurring or only happen once. Recurring days of special observance include:\n\n* The quarterly [[Ember Days]], days of abstinence and prayer for those in the ministry and for those exploring a vocation to the ordained ministry. They should be marked by abstinence, prayer (including the [[Litany]] for the Ember Days at the Eucharist or the Daily Office), perhaps by special offerings for theological students in the diocese, region, parish or district. The colour is purple\n* The Rogation Days, observed by asking God's blessings on given resources. These days include giving witness to one's faith in the Rogation Procession (procession is purple, the Eucharist is white).\n\nThere are days celebrated by organisations within the church such as the Mothers' Union, the MBH and Companions, the SSF and TSSF, the CSC and Associates, and CSM and Associates, [[Girls Friendly Society]], Melanesian Guild of Servers, Catechist and Lay Preachers Associations, Men's Fellowships, Youth Groups and Sunday Schools, etc. These are to be coordinated with the rector and may be celebrated on free days or Class III days. They may be celebrated on Class II days (or as Class II days) if they are significant to the organisation and do not contravene the tables of precedence above, or overshadow the saint or event celebrated on that day.\n\n== Calendar of saint's days and holy days ==\n''These dates apply unless transferred according to the Rules of Precedence.''\n\n=== January ===\n*1 [[Circumcision of

It can be an ambiguous term especially as the displayed resolution is controlled by different factors in [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) displays, [[flat-panel display]]s (including [[liquid-crystal display]]s) and projection displays using fixed picture-element (pixel) arrays.\n\nIt is usually quoted as ''{{resx|width|height}}'', with the units in pixels: for example, ''{{resx|1024|768}}'' means the width is 1024 pixels and the height is 768 pixels. This example would normally be spoken as \"ten twenty-four by seven sixty-eight\" or \"ten twenty-four by seven six eight\".\n\nOne use of the term ''display resolution'' applies to fixed-pixel-array displays such as [[plasma display panel]]s (PDP), liquid-crystal displays (LCD), [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP) projectors, [[AMOLED|OLED]] displays, and similar technologies, and is simply the physical number of columns and rows of pixels creating the display (e.g. {{resx|1920|1080}}). A consequence of having a fixed-grid display is that, for multi-format video inputs, all displays need a \"scaling engine\" (a digital video processor that includes a memory array) to match the incoming picture format to the display.\n\nFor device displays such as phones, tablets, monitors and televisions, the use of the term ''display resolution'' as defined above is a misnomer, though common. The term ''display resolution'' is usually used to mean ''pixel dimensions'', the maximum number of pixels in each dimension (e.g. {{resx|1920|1080}}), which does not tell anything about the pixel density of the display on which the image is actually formed: resolution properly refers to the [[pixel density]], the number of pixels per unit distance or area, not the ''total'' number of pixels. In digital measurement, the display resolution would be given in pixels per inch (PPI). In analog measurement, if the screen is 10&nbsp;inches high, then the horizontal resolution is measured across a square 10&nbsp;inches wide. <ref>{{cite web |title=Screen resolution? Aspect ratio?

In the case of television inputs, many manufacturers will take the input and zoom it out to \"[[overscan]]\" the display by as much as 5% so input resolution is not necessarily display resolution. Graphics wise, the input rate of resolution only changes frame rate by a little bit (e.g. 1080p - 720p = 5f).\n\nThe eye's perception of ''display resolution'' can be affected by a number of factors{{snd}} see [[image resolution]] and [[optical resolution]]. One factor is the display screen's rectangular shape, which is expressed as the ratio of the physical picture width to the physical picture height. This is known as the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]. A screen's physical aspect ratio and the individual pixels' aspect ratio may not necessarily be the same. An array of [[Graphics display resolution#WXGA|{{resx|1280|720}}]] on a [[16:9]] display has square pixels, but an array of [[Graphics display resolution#XGA (1024x768)|{{resx|1024|768}}]] on a 16:9 display has oblong pixels.\n\nAn example of pixel shape affecting \"resolution\" or perceived sharpness: displaying more information in a smaller area using a higher resolution makes the image much clearer or \"sharper\". However, most recent screen technologies are fixed at a certain resolution; making the resolution lower on these kinds of screens will greatly decrease sharpness, as an interpolation process is used to \"fix\" the non-native resolution input into the display's [[native resolution]] output.\n\nWhile some CRT-based displays may use [[video processing|digital video processing]] that involves [[image scaling]] using memory arrays, ultimately \"display resolution\" in CRT-type displays is affected by different parameters such as spot size and focus, [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatic effects]] in the display corners, the color phosphor pitch [[shadow mask]] (such as [[Trinitron]]) in color displays, and the video bandwidth.\n\n==Interlacing versus progressive scan==\n{{Main|Interlaced video}}\n\n==Overscan and underscan==\n[[File:Fatty watching himself on TV.jpg|thumb|right|A 16:9-ratio television from October 2004]]\n[[File:MacBookEeePCNintendoDS.JPG|thumb|right|Difference between screen sizes in some common devices, such as a [[Nintendo DS]] and two laptops shown here.]]\n{{Main|Overscan}}\n\nMost television display manufacturers \"overscan\" the pictures on their displays (CRTs and PDPs, LCDs etc.), so that the effective on-screen picture may be reduced from {{resx|720|576}}&nbsp;(480) to {{resx|680|550}}&nbsp;(450), for example. The size of the invisible area somewhat depends on the display device. HD televisions do this as well, to a similar extent.\n\nComputer displays including projectors generally do not overscan although many models (particularly CRT displays) allow it. CRT displays tend to be underscanned in stock configurations, to compensate for the increasing distortions at the corners.\n\n==Current standards==\n{{Further information|List of common resolutions}}\n\n===Televisions===\nTelevisions are of the following resolutions:\n\n* Standard-definition television ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]]):\n** [[480i]] ([[NTSC|NTSC-compatible]] digital standard employing two [[Interlaced video|interlace]]d fields of 243 lines each)\n** [[576i]] ([[PAL|PAL-compatible]] digital standard employing two interlaced fields of 288 lines each)\n* Enhanced-definition television ([[Enhanced-definition television|EDTV]]):\n** [[480p]] ({{resx|720|480}} [[progressive scan]])\n** [[576p]] ({{resx|720|576}} progressive scan)\n* High-definition television ([[High-definition television|HDTV]]):\n** [[720p]] ({{resx|1280|720}} progressive scan)\n** [[1080i]] ({{resx|1920|1080}} split into two interlaced fields of 540 lines)\n** [[1080p]] ({{resx|1920|1080}} progressive scan)\n* Ultra-high-definition television ([[Ultra-high-definition television|UHDTV]]):\n** [[Ultra-high-definition television|4K UHD]] ({{resx|3840|2160}} progressive scan)\n** [[Ultra-high-definition television|DCI 4K]] ({{resx|4096|2160}})\n** [[Ultra-high-definition television|8K UHD]] ({{resx|7680|4320}} progressive scan)\n\n===Computer monitors===\n{{Further information|Computer display standard}}\nComputer monitors have traditionally possessed higher resolutions than most televisions.\n\n====2000s====\nIn 2002, {{resx|1024|768}} [[XGA|eXtended Graphics Array]] was the most common display resolution.<ref>{{cite web |title=Higher screen resolutions more popular for exploring the internet according to OneStat.com |url=http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox8.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716184304/http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox8.html |publisher=OneStat.com |date=2002-07-24 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |accessdate=2012-07-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Screen resolution 800x600 significantly decreased for exploring the Internet according to OneStat.com |url=http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox51_screen_resolutions_internet.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716184450/http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox51_screen_resolutions_internet.html |publisher=OneStat.com |date=2007-04-18 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |accessdate=2012-07-22 }}</ref> Many web sites and multimedia products were re-designed from the previous {{resx|800|600}} format to the layouts optimized for {{resx|1024|768}}.\n\nThe availability of inexpensive LCD monitors has made the 5:4 aspect ratio resolution of {{resx|1280|1024}} more popular for desktop usage during the first decade of the 21st century.

Most LCD manufacturers do make note of the panel's native resolution as working in a non-native resolution on LCDs will result in a poorer image, due to dropping of pixels to make the image fit (when using DVI) or insufficient sampling of the analog signal (when using VGA connector). Few CRT manufacturers will quote the true native resolution, because CRTs are analog in nature and can vary their display from as low as 320 \u00d7 200 (emulation of older computers or game consoles) to as high as the internal board will allow, or the image becomes too detailed for the vacuum tube to recreate (''i.e.'', analog blur). Thus, CRTs provide variability in a resolution that fixed resolution LCDs cannot provide.\n\nIn recent years the 16:9 aspect ratio has become more common in notebook displays. {{resx|1366|768}} ([[720p|HD]]) has become popular for most notebook sizes, while {{resx|1600|900}} (HD+) and {{resx|1920|1080}} ([[1080p|FHD]]) are available for larger notebooks.\n\nAs far as [[Digital cinematography#Acquisition Formats|digital cinematography]] is concerned, video resolution standards depend first on the frames' aspect ratio in the [[film stock]] (which is usually [[motion picture film scanner|scanned]] for [[digital intermediate]] post-production) and then on the actual points' count. Although there is not a unique set of standardized sizes, it is commonplace within the motion picture industry to refer to \"''n''K\" image \"quality\", where ''n'' is a (small, usually even) integer number which translates into a set of actual resolutions, depending on the [[film format]]. As a reference consider that, for a 4:3 (around 1.33:1) aspect ratio which a film frame (no matter what is its format) is expected to ''horizontally fit in'', ''n'' is the multiplier of 1024 such that the horizontal resolution is exactly ''1024\u2022n'' points.{{cn |date=May 2018}} For example, 2K reference resolution is {{resx|2048|1536}} pixels, whereas 4K reference resolution is {{resx|4096|3072}} pixels. Nevertheless, 2K may also refer to resolutions like {{resx|2048|1556}} (full-aperture), {{resx|2048|1152}} ([[HDTV]], 16:9 aspect ratio) or {{resx|2048|872}} pixels ([[Cinemascope]], 2.35:1 aspect ratio). It is also worth noting that while a frame resolution may be, for example, 3:2 ({{resx|720|480}} NTSC), that is not what you will see on-screen (i.e. 4:3 or 16:9 depending on the orientation of the rectangular pixels).\n\n====Evolution of standards====\n<!--Linked from [[Pointer (graphical user interfaces)]]-->\nMany personal computers introduced in the late 1970s and the 1980s were designed to use television receivers as their display devices, making the resolutions dependent on the television standards in use, including [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]]. Picture sizes were usually limited to ensure the visibility of all the pixels in the major television standards and the broad range of television sets with varying amounts of over scan. The actual drawable picture area was, therefore, somewhat smaller than the whole screen, and was usually surrounded by a static-colored border (see image to right). Also, the interlace scanning was usually omitted in order to provide more stability to the picture, effectively halving the vertical resolution in progress. {{resx|160|200}}, {{resx|320|200}} and {{resx|640|200}} on NTSC were relatively common resolutions in the era (224, 240 or 256 scanlines were also common). In the IBM PC world, these resolutions came to be used by 16-color [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] video cards.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of using a classic television is that the computer display resolution is higher than the television could decode. Chroma resolution for NTSC/PAL televisions are bandwidth-limited to a maximum 1.5 megahertz, or approximately 160 pixels wide, which led to blurring of the color for 320- or 640-wide signals, and made text difficult to read (see second image to right). Many users upgraded to higher-quality televisions with [[S-Video]] or [[Color Graphics Adapter|RGBI]] inputs that helped eliminate chroma blur and produce more legible displays. The earliest, lowest cost solution to the chroma problem was offered in the [[Atari 2600]] Video Computer System and the [[Apple II Plus|Apple II+]], both of which offered the option to disable the color and view a legacy black-and-white signal. On the Commodore 64, the [[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]] mirrored the Mac OS method of using black-and-white to improve readability.\n\nThe {{resx|640|400i}} resolution ({{resx|720|480i}} with borders disabled) was first introduced by home computers such as the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] and, later, Atari Falcon. These computers used interlace to boost the maximum vertical resolution. These modes were only suited to graphics or gaming, as the flickering interlace made reading text in word processor, database, or spreadsheet software difficult. (Modern game consoles solve this problem by pre-filtering the 480i video to a lower resolution. For example, [[Final Fantasy XII]] suffers from flicker when the filter is turned off, but stabilizes once filtering is restored. The computers of the 1980s lacked sufficient power to run similar filtering software.)\n\nThe advantage of a {{resx|720|480i}} overscanned computer was an easy interface with interlaced TV production, leading to the development of Newtek's [[Video Toaster]]. This device allowed Amigas to be used for CGI creation in various news departments (example: weather overlays), drama programs such as NBC's ''[[seaQuest DSV|seaQuest]]'', The WB's ''[[Babylon 5]]'', and early computer-generated animation by Disney for ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''.\n\nIn the PC world, the [[IBM PS/2]] VGA (multi-color) on-board graphics chips used a non-interlaced (progressive) 640{{nbsp}}\u00d7{{nbsp}}480{{nbsp}}\u00d7{{nbsp}}16 color resolution that was easier to read and thus more useful for office work. It was the standard resolution from 1990 to around 1996.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The standard resolution was {{resx|800|600}} until around 2000. Microsoft [[Windows XP]], released in 2001, was designed to run at {{resx|800|600}} minimum, although it is possible to select the original {{resx|640|480}} in the Advanced Settings window.\n\nPrograms designed to mimic older hardware such as Atari, Sega, or Nintendo game consoles (emulators) when attached to multiscan CRTs, routinely use much lower resolutions, such as {{resx|160|200}} or {{resx|320|400}} for greater authenticity, though other emulators have taken advantage of pixelation recognition on circle, square, triangle and other geometric features on a lesser resolution for a more scaled vector rendering. Some emulators, at higher resolutions, can even mimic the aperture grille and shadow masks of CRT monitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/CRT-Royale |title=CRT-Royale - Emulation General Wiki |publisher=Emulation.gametechwiki.com |date=2019-02-03 |accessdate=2019-12-15}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:C64 startup animiert.gif|In this image of a [[Commodore 64]] startup screen, the [[overscan]] region (the lighter-coloured border) would have been barely visible when shown on a normal television.\nFile:CGA CompVsRGB Text.png|A {{resx|640|200}} display as produced by a monitor (left) and television\nFile:Torak.gif|16-color (top) and 256-color (bottom) progressive images from a 1980s [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] card.

It can be an ambiguous term especially as the displayed resolution is controlled by different factors in [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) displays, [[flat-panel display]]s (including [[liquid-crystal display]]s) and projection displays using fixed picture-element (pixel) arrays.\n\nIt is usually quoted as ''{{resx|width|height}}'', with the units in pixels: for example, ''{{resx|1024|768}}'' means the width is 1024 pixels and the height is 768 pixels. This example would normally be spoken as \"ten twenty-four by seven sixty-eight\" or \"ten twenty-four by seven six eight\".\n\nOne use of the term ''display resolution'' applies to fixed-pixel-array displays such as [[plasma display panel]]s (PDP), liquid-crystal displays (LCD), [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP) projectors, [[AMOLED|OLED]] displays, and similar technologies, and is simply the physical number of columns and rows of pixels creating the display (e.g. {{resx|1920|1080}}). A consequence of having a fixed-grid display is that, for multi-format video inputs, all displays need a \"scaling engine\" (a digital video processor that includes a memory array) to match the incoming picture format to the display.\n\nFor device displays such as phones, tablets, monitors and televisions, the use of the term ''display resolution'' as defined above is a misnomer, though common. The term ''display resolution'' is usually used to mean ''pixel dimensions'', the maximum number of pixels in each dimension (e.g. {{resx|1920|1080}}), which does not tell anything about the pixel density of the display on which the image is actually formed: resolution properly refers to the [[pixel density]], the number of pixels per unit distance or area, not the ''total'' number of pixels. In digital measurement, the display resolution would be given in pixels per inch (PPI). In analog measurement, if the screen is 10&nbsp;inches high, then the horizontal resolution is measured across a square 10&nbsp;inches wide. <ref>{{cite web |title=Screen resolution? Aspect ratio?

In the case of television inputs, many manufacturers will take the input and zoom it out to \"[[overscan]]\" the display by as much as 5% so input resolution is not necessarily display resolution. Graphics wise, the input rate of resolution only changes frame rate by a little bit (e.g. 1080p - 720p = 5f).\n\nThe eye's perception of ''display resolution'' can be affected by a number of factors{{snd}} see [[image resolution]] and [[optical resolution]]. One factor is the display screen's rectangular shape, which is expressed as the ratio of the physical picture width to the physical picture height. This is known as the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]. A screen's physical aspect ratio and the individual pixels' aspect ratio may not necessarily be the same. An array of [[Graphics display resolution#WXGA|{{resx|1280|720}}]] on a [[16:9]] display has square pixels, but an array of [[Graphics display resolution#XGA (1024x768)|{{resx|1024|768}}]] on a 16:9 display has oblong pixels.\n\nAn example of pixel shape affecting \"resolution\" or perceived sharpness: displaying more information in a smaller area using a higher resolution makes the image much clearer or \"sharper\". However, most recent screen technologies are fixed at a certain resolution; making the resolution lower on these kinds of screens will greatly decrease sharpness, as an interpolation process is used to \"fix\" the non-native resolution input into the display's [[native resolution]] output.\n\nWhile some CRT-based displays may use [[video processing|digital video processing]] that involves [[image scaling]] using memory arrays, ultimately \"display resolution\" in CRT-type displays is affected by different parameters such as spot size and focus, [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatic effects]] in the display corners, the color phosphor pitch [[shadow mask]] (such as [[Trinitron]]) in color displays, and the video bandwidth.\n\n==Interlacing versus progressive scan==\n{{Main|Interlaced video}}\n\n==Overscan and underscan==\n[[File:Fatty watching himself on TV.jpg|thumb|right|A 16:9-ratio television from October 2004]]\n[[File:MacBookEeePCNintendoDS.JPG|thumb|right|Difference between screen sizes in some common devices, such as a [[Nintendo DS]] and two laptops shown here.]]\n{{Main|Overscan}}\n\nMost television display manufacturers \"overscan\" the pictures on their displays (CRTs and PDPs, LCDs etc.), so that the effective on-screen picture may be reduced from {{resx|720|576}}&nbsp;(480) to {{resx|680|550}}&nbsp;(450), for example. The size of the invisible area somewhat depends on the display device. HD televisions do this as well, to a similar extent.\n\nComputer displays including projectors generally do not overscan although many models (particularly CRT displays) allow it. CRT displays tend to be underscanned in stock configurations, to compensate for the increasing distortions at the corners.\n\n==Current standards==\n{{Further information|List of common resolutions}}\n\n===Televisions===\nTelevisions are of the following resolutions:\n\n* Standard-definition television ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]]):\n** [[480i]] ([[NTSC|NTSC-compatible]] digital standard employing two [[Interlaced video|interlace]]d fields of 243 lines each)\n** [[576i]] ([[PAL|PAL-compatible]] digital standard employing two interlaced fields of 288 lines each)\n* Enhanced-definition television ([[Enhanced-definition television|EDTV]]):\n** [[480p]] ({{resx|720|480}} [[progressive scan]])\n** [[576p]] ({{resx|720|576}} progressive scan)\n* High-definition television ([[High-definition television|HDTV]]):\n** [[720p]] ({{resx|1280|720}} progressive scan)\n** [[1080i]] ({{resx|1920|1080}} split into two interlaced fields of 540 lines)\n** [[1080p]] ({{resx|1920|1080}} progressive scan)\n* Ultra-high-definition television ([[Ultra-high-definition television|UHDTV]]):\n** [[Ultra-high-definition television|4K UHD]] ({{resx|3840|2160}} progressive scan)\n** [[Ultra-high-definition television|DCI 4K]] ({{resx|4096|2160}})\n** [[Ultra-high-definition television|8K UHD]] ({{resx|7680|4320}} progressive scan)\n\n===Computer monitors===\n{{Further information|Computer display standard}}\nComputer monitors have traditionally possessed higher resolutions than most televisions.\n\n====2000s====\nIn 2002, {{resx|1024|768}} [[XGA|eXtended Graphics Array]] was the most common display resolution.<ref>{{cite web |title=Higher screen resolutions more popular for exploring the internet according to OneStat.com |url=http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox8.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716184304/http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox8.html |publisher=OneStat.com |date=2002-07-24 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |accessdate=2012-07-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Screen resolution 800x600 significantly decreased for exploring the Internet according to OneStat.com |url=http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox51_screen_resolutions_internet.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716184450/http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox51_screen_resolutions_internet.html |publisher=OneStat.com |date=2007-04-18 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |accessdate=2012-07-22 }}</ref> Many web sites and multimedia products were re-designed from the previous {{resx|800|600}} format to the layouts optimized for {{resx|1024|768}}.\n\nThe availability of inexpensive LCD monitors has made the 5:4 aspect ratio resolution of {{resx|1280|1024}} more popular for desktop usage during the first decade of the 21st century.

Most LCD manufacturers do make note of the panel's native resolution as working in a non-native resolution on LCDs will result in a poorer image, due to dropping of pixels to make the image fit (when using DVI) or insufficient sampling of the analog signal (when using VGA connector). Few CRT manufacturers will quote the true native resolution, because CRTs are analog in nature and can vary their display from as low as 320 \u00d7 200 (emulation of older computers or game consoles) to as high as the internal board will allow, or the image becomes too detailed for the vacuum tube to recreate (''i.e.'', analog blur). Thus, CRTs provide a variability in resolution that fixed resolution LCDs cannot provide.\n\nIn recent years the 16:9 aspect ratio has become more common in notebook displays. {{resx|1366|768}} ([[720p|HD]]) has become popular for most notebook sizes, while {{resx|1600|900}} (HD+) and {{resx|1920|1080}} ([[1080p|FHD]]) are available for larger notebooks.\n\nAs far as [[Digital cinematography#Acquisition Formats|digital cinematography]] is concerned, video resolution standards depend first on the frames' aspect ratio in the [[film stock]] (which is usually [[motion picture film scanner|scanned]] for [[digital intermediate]] post-production) and then on the actual points' count. Although there is not a unique set of standardized sizes, it is commonplace within the motion picture industry to refer to \"''n''K\" image \"quality\", where ''n'' is a (small, usually even) integer number which translates into a set of actual resolutions, depending on the [[film format]]. As a reference consider that, for a 4:3 (around 1.33:1) aspect ratio which a film frame (no matter what is its format) is expected to ''horizontally fit in'', ''n'' is the multiplier of 1024 such that the horizontal resolution is exactly ''1024\u2022n'' points.{{cn |date=May 2018}} For example, 2K reference resolution is {{resx|2048|1536}} pixels, whereas 4K reference resolution is {{resx|4096|3072}} pixels. Nevertheless, 2K may also refer to resolutions like {{resx|2048|1556}} (full-aperture), {{resx|2048|1152}} ([[HDTV]], 16:9 aspect ratio) or {{resx|2048|872}} pixels ([[Cinemascope]], 2.35:1 aspect ratio). It is also worth noting that while a frame resolution may be, for example, 3:2 ({{resx|720|480}} NTSC), that is not what you will see on-screen (i.e. 4:3 or 16:9 depending on the orientation of the rectangular pixels).\n\n====Evolution of standards====\n<!--Linked from [[Pointer (graphical user interfaces)]]-->\nMany personal computers introduced in the late 1970s and the 1980s were designed to use television receivers as their display devices, making the resolutions dependent on the television standards in use, including [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]]. Picture sizes were usually limited to ensure the visibility of all the pixels in the major television standards and the broad range of television sets with varying amounts of over scan. The actual drawable picture area was, therefore, somewhat smaller than the whole screen, and was usually surrounded by a static-colored border (see image to right). Also, the interlace scanning was usually omitted in order to provide more stability to the picture, effectively halving the vertical resolution in progress. {{resx|160|200}}, {{resx|320|200}} and {{resx|640|200}} on NTSC were relatively common resolutions in the era (224, 240 or 256 scanlines were also common). In the IBM PC world, these resolutions came to be used by 16-color [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] video cards.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of using a classic television is that the computer display resolution is higher than the television could decode. Chroma resolution for NTSC/PAL televisions are bandwidth-limited to a maximum 1.5 megahertz, or approximately 160 pixels wide, which led to blurring of the color for 320- or 640-wide signals, and made text difficult to read (see second image to right). Many users upgraded to higher-quality televisions with [[S-Video]] or [[Color Graphics Adapter|RGBI]] inputs that helped eliminate chroma blur and produce more legible displays. The earliest, lowest cost solution to the chroma problem was offered in the [[Atari 2600]] Video Computer System and the [[Apple II Plus|Apple II+]], both of which offered the option to disable the color and view a legacy black-and-white signal. On the Commodore 64, the [[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]] mirrored the Mac OS method of using black-and-white to improve readability.\n\nThe {{resx|640|400i}} resolution ({{resx|720|480i}} with borders disabled) was first introduced by home computers such as the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] and, later, Atari Falcon. These computers used interlace to boost the maximum vertical resolution. These modes were only suited to graphics or gaming, as the flickering interlace made reading text in word processor, database, or spreadsheet software difficult. (Modern game consoles solve this problem by pre-filtering the 480i video to a lower resolution. For example, [[Final Fantasy XII]] suffers from flicker when the filter is turned off, but stabilizes once filtering is restored. The computers of the 1980s lacked sufficient power to run similar filtering software.)\n\nThe advantage of a {{resx|720|480i}} overscanned computer was an easy interface with interlaced TV production, leading to the development of Newtek's [[Video Toaster]]. This device allowed Amigas to be used for CGI creation in various news departments (example: weather overlays), drama programs such as NBC's ''[[seaQuest DSV|seaQuest]]'', The WB's ''[[Babylon 5]]'', and early computer-generated animation by Disney for ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''.\n\nIn the PC world, the [[IBM PS/2]] VGA (multi-color) on-board graphics chips used a non-interlaced (progressive) 640{{nbsp}}\u00d7{{nbsp}}480{{nbsp}}\u00d7{{nbsp}}16 color resolution that was easier to read and thus more useful for office work. It was the standard resolution from 1990 to around 1996.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The standard resolution was {{resx|800|600}} until around 2000. Microsoft [[Windows XP]], released in 2001, was designed to run at {{resx|800|600}} minimum, although it is possible to select the original {{resx|640|480}} in the Advanced Settings window.\n\nPrograms designed to mimic older hardware such as Atari, Sega, or Nintendo game consoles (emulators) when attached to multiscan CRTs, routinely use much lower resolutions, such as {{resx|160|200}} or {{resx|320|400}} for greater authenticity, though other emulators have taken advantage of pixelation recognition on circle, square, triangle and other geometric features on a lesser resolution for a more scaled vector rendering. Some emulators, at higher resolutions, can even mimic the aperture grille and shadow masks of CRT monitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/CRT-Royale |title=CRT-Royale - Emulation General Wiki |publisher=Emulation.gametechwiki.com |date=2019-02-03 |accessdate=2019-12-15}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:C64 startup animiert.gif|In this image of a [[Commodore 64]] startup screen, the [[overscan]] region (the lighter-coloured border) would have been barely visible when shown on a normal television.\nFile:CGA CompVsRGB Text.png|A {{resx|640|200}} display as produced by a monitor (left) and television\nFile:Torak.gif|16-color (top) and 256-color (bottom) progressive images from a 1980s [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] card.
