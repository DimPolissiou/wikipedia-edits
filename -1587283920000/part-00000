''Tree of Life \u2013 Asteraceae'']</ref> Which of the two families actually is the larger is unclear, because of the uncertainty about how many [[Extant taxon|extant]] species each family includes. \n\nNearly all Asteraceae bear their flowers in dense heads (capitula or pseudanthia) surrounded by [[bract#Involucral bracts|involucral bracts]]. When viewed from a distance, each [[Capitulum (flower)|capitulum]] may have the appearance of being a single flower. Enlarged outer (peripheral) flowers in the capitula may resemble petals, and the involucral bracts may look like a calyx. The name Asteraceae comes from the type genus ''[[Aster (genus)|Aster]]'', from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1}}, meaning star, and refers to the star-like form of the  inflorescence.

The family has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], with species ranging from [[Wiktionary:subpolar|subpolar]] to tropical regions, colonizing a wide variety of habitats. The largest proportion of the species occur in the [[arid]] and semiarid regions of subtropical and lower temperate latitudes.<ref name=\"Barkley et al.\">{{eFloras|1|10074|Asteraceae |first1=Theodore M. |last1=Barkley |first2=Luc |last2=Brouillet |first3=John L. |last3=Strother |volume=19, 20 and 21}}</ref> The Asteraceae may represent as much as 10% of [[Autochthon (nature)|autochthonous]] flora in many regions of the world.\n\nAsteraceae is an economically important family, providing products such as [[cooking oil]]s, [[leaf vegetable]]s like [[lettuce]], [[sunflower seed]]s, [[artichoke]]s, [[sweetening agent]]s, coffee substitutes and [[herbal tea]]s. Several genera are of [[horticulture|horticultural]] importance, including pot marigold (''[[Calendula officinalis]]''), ''[[Echinacea]]'' (coneflowers), various daisies, [[Erigeron|fleabane]], [[chrysanthemum]]s, [[dahlia]]s, [[zinnia]]s, and [[helenium]]s.

Of these, many are [[invasive species]] in particular regions, often having been introduced by human agency. Examples include various [[tumbleweed]]s, ''[[Bidens]]'', [[Ambrosia (plant)| ragweeds]], [[thistle]]s, and [[Taraxacum officinale|dandelion]]. Dandelion, as a case in point, was introduced into North America by European settlers who used the young leaves as a salad green.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.invasiveplantatlas.org/subject.html?sub=3887 | title = dandelion Taraxacum officinale | accessdate = 10 September 2012 | work = Invasive Plant Atlas of the United States}}</ref>\n\nThe study of this family is known as [[synantherology]].\n\n== Etymology and pronunciation==\nThe name Asteraceae ({{IPAc-en|lang|\u02cc|\u00e6|s|t|\u0259|\u02c8|r|e\u026a|s|i|,_|-|s|i|\u02cc|a\u026a|,_|-|s|i|\u02cc|e\u026a|,_|-|s|i|\u02cc|i\u02d0}}) comes to [[international scientific vocabulary]] from [[New Latin]], from  ''[[Aster (genus)|Aster]]'', the [[type genus]], + ''[[wikt:-aceae#Suffix|-aceae]]'',<ref name=\"MWU\">{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/ |postscript=.}}</ref> a standardized [[suffix]] for plant family names in modern taxonomy. The genus name comes from the [[Classical Latin]] word {{wikt-lang|la|aster}}, \"star\", which came from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1}} ({{transl|grc|ast\u1e17r}}), \"star\".<ref name=\"MWU\"/>\n\nThe earlier name, Compositae (now recognized as an alternative name<ref name=ICN185/>) means \"composite\" and refers to the characteristic [[inflorescence]], a special type of [[pseudanthium]] found in only a few other [[angiosperm]] families.\n\nThe vernacular name ''daisy'', widely applied to members of this family, is derived from the [[Old English]] name of the daisy (''[[Bellis perennis]]''): {{wikt-lang|ang|d\u00e6\u0121es \u0113a\u0121e}}, meaning \"day's eye\". This is because the petals open at dawn and close at dusk.\n\n== Distribution ==\nAsteraceae species have a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], and are found everywhere except [[Antarctica]] and the extreme Arctic. They are especially numerous in tropical and subtropical regions (notably [[Central America]], eastern [[Brazil]], the [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]], [[the Levant]], [[southern Africa]], [[central Asia]], and [[southwestern China]]).<ref name=\"Panero & Crozier\" />\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{See also|List of Asteraceae genera}}\n\nCompositae, the original name for Asteraceae, were first described in 1792 by the German botanist [[Paul Dietrich Giseke]].<ref>Solbrig, O.T.

As a result, several of these genera have required multiple revisions.<ref name=\"Judd\">Judd, W.S., Campbell, C.S., Kellogg, E.A., Stevens, P.F. (2007) Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland.</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nMembers of the Asteraceae are mostly [[herbaceous plants]], but some shrubs, [[Vine|climbers]] and trees (such as ''[[Lachanodes arborea]]'') do exist. They are generally easy to distinguish from other plants, mainly because of their characteristic [[inflorescence]] and other shared characteristics.<ref name=\"Judd\" /> However, determining genera and species of some groups such as ''[[Hieracium#Species|Hieracium]]'' is notoriously difficult (see \"[[damned yellow composite]]\" for example).\n\n=== Roots and stems ===\nMembers of the Asteraceae generally produce [[taproot]]s, but sometimes they possess fibrous root systems. Stems are herbaceous aerial branched cylindrical with glandular hairs generally erect but can be prostrate to ascending. Some species have underground stems in the form of [[caudex|caudices]] or [[rhizome]]s. These can be fleshy or woody depending on the species.<ref name=\"Barkley et al.\" />\n\n=== Leaves ===\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] and the stems very often contain secretory canals with [[resin]] or [[latex]] (particularly common among the Cichorioideae). The leaves can be [[phyllotaxis|alternate]], [[phyllotaxis|opposite]], or [[phyllotaxis|whorled]]. They may be simple, but are often deeply [[leaf#Morphology|lobed]] or otherwise [[leaf#Morphology|incised]], often [[leaf#Morphology|conduplicate]] or [[leaf#Morphology|revolute]]. The margins can be entire or lobed or toothed.\n\n=== Flowers ===\n\n==== Floral heads ====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Bidens flwr.jpg\n| width1

what appears to be a single flower is actually a cluster of much smaller flowers.<ref name=CDF>Sia Morhardt, Emil Morhardt, California Desert Flowers, University of California Press, pp. 29\u201332</ref> The overall appearance of the cluster, as a single flower, functions in attracting [[pollinators]] in the same way as the structure of an individual flower in some other plant families.<ref name=CDF /> The older family name, Compositae, comes from the fact that what appears to be a single flower is actually a ''composite'' of smaller flowers.<ref name=CDF /> The \"petals\" or \"sunrays\" in a sunflower head are actually individual strap-shaped<ref name=MDW>Pam MacKay, Mojave Desert Wildflowers, illustration p. 35</ref> flowers called '''ray flowers''', and the \"sun disk\" is made of smaller circular shaped individual flowers called '''disc flowers'''.<ref name=CDF /> The word \"aster\" means \"star\" in Greek, referring to the appearance of some family members, as a \"star\" surrounded by \"rays\".<ref name=CDF /> The cluster of flowers that may appear to be a single flower, is called a ''head''.<ref name=CDF /> The entire head may move tracking the sun, like a \"smart\" solar panel, which maximizes reflectivity of the whole unit and can thereby attract more pollinators.<ref name=CDF />\nAt the base of the head, and surrounding the flowers before opening, is a bundle of [[sepal]]-like [[bract]]s or scales called [[phyllaries]], which together form the ''involucre'' that protects the individual flowers in the head before opening.<ref name=CDF /> The individual heads have the smaller individual flowers arranged on a round or dome-like structure called the ''receptacle''.<ref name=CDF /> The flowers mature first at the outside, moving toward the center, with the youngest in the middle.<ref name=CDF />\n\nThe individual flowers in a head have 5 fused petals (rarely 4), but instead of sepals, have threadlike, hairy, or bristly structures called ''[[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]]'', which surround the fruit and can stick to animal fur or be lifted by wind, aiding in seed dispersal.<ref name=CDF /> The whitish fluffy head of a dandelion, commonly blown on by children, is made of the pappus, with tiny seeds attached at the ends, whereby the pappus provides a parachute like structure to help the seed be carried away in the

other members.<ref name=CDF /> A ''ligule'' is the strap-shaped tongue of the [[petal|corolla]] of either a ray flower or of a ligulate flower.<ref name=MDW />  A ''disk flower'' (or ''disc flower'') is a radially symmetric (i.e., with identical shaped petals arranged in circle around the center) individual flower in the head, which is ringed by ray flowers when both are present.<ref name=CDF /><ref name=MDW /> Sometimes ray flowers may be slightly off from radial symmetry, or weakly bilaterally symmetric, as in the case of desert pincushions ''[[Chaenactis fremontii]]''.<ref name=CDF

flowers that are sterile, male, or have both male and female parts, it is a ''discoid head''.<ref name=CDF /> ''Disciform heads'' have only disc flowers, but may have two kinds (male flowers and female flowers) in one head, or may have different heads of two kinds (all male, or all female).<ref name=CDF /> ''Pistillate heads'' have all female flowers. ''Staminate heads'' have all male flowers.<ref name=CDF />\n\nSometimes, but rarely, the head contains only a single flower, or has a single flowered pistillate (female) head, and a multi-flowered male staminate (male) head.<ref name=CDF />\n\n==== Floral structures ====\n[[File:Carduus flowerdiagram.png|thumb|right|Flower diagram of ''[[Carduus]]'' (Carduoideae) shows (outermost to innermost): subtending bract and stem axis; fused calyx; fused corolla; stamens fused to corolla; gynoecium with two carpels and one [[locule]] ]]\nThe distinguishing characteristic of Asteraceae is their [[inflorescence]], a type of specialised, composite flower head or ''[[pseudanthium]]'', technically called a calathium or ''[[Pseudanthium|capitulum]]'',<ref name=Beentje>{{cite book|first=Henk|last=Beentje|year=2010|title=The Kew Plant Glossary, an illustrated dictionary of plant terms|publisher=Kew Publishing|location=Richmond, U.K.|isbn=9781842464229 }}</ref><ref>Usher, G. (1966) A dictionary of botany, including terms used in bio-chemistry, soil science, and statistics. {{LCCN|666025447}}</ref> that may look superficially like a single flower. The ''capitulum'' is a contracted [[raceme]] composed of numerous individual [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] [[flower]]s, called ''florets'', all sharing the same [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]].\n\nA set of [[bract]]s forms an [[involucral bract|involucre]] surrounding the base of the capitulum. These are called \"phyllaries\", or \"involucral bracts\". They may simulate the [[sepal]]s of the pseudanthium. These are mostly herbaceous but can also be brightly coloured (e.g. ''[[Helichrysum]]'') or have a scarious (dry and membranous) texture. The phyllaries can be free or fused, and arranged in one to many rows, overlapping like the tiles of a roof (''imbricate'') or not (this variation is important in identification of tribes and genera).\n\nEach floret may be subtended by a bract, called a \"palea\" or \"receptacular bract\". These bracts are often called \"[[chaff]]\". The presence or absence of these bracts, their distribution on the receptacle, and their size and shape are all important diagnostic characteristics for genera and tribes.\n\nThe florets have five [[petal]]s fused at the base to form a [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] tube and they may be either [[actinomorphic]] or [[zygomorphic]]. ''Disc florets'' are usually actinomorphic, with five petal lips on the rim of the corolla tube. The petal lips may be either very short, or long, in which case they form deeply lobed petals. The latter is the only kind of floret in the Carduoideae, while the first kind is more widespread. ''Ray florets'' are always highly zygomorphic and are characterised by the presence of a ''ligule'', a strap-shaped structure on the edge of the corolla tube consisting of fused petals. In the Asteroideae and other minor subfamilies these are usually borne only on florets at the circumference of the capitulum and have a 3+2 scheme &mdash; above the fused corolla tube, three very long fused [[petal]]s form the ligule, with the other two petals being inconspicuously small. The Cichorioideae has only ray florets, with a 5+0 scheme &mdash; all five petals form the ligule. A 4+1 scheme is found in the Barnadesioideae. The tip of the ligule is often divided into teeth, each one representing a petal. Some marginal florets may have no petals at all (filiform floret).\n\nThe [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] of the florets may be absent, but when present is always modified into a [[pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] of two or more teeth, scales or bristles and this is often involved in the dispersion of the seeds. As with the bracts, the nature of the pappus is an important diagnostic feature.\n\nThere are usually five [[stamen]]s. The filaments are fused to the corolla, while the anthers are generally [[connation|connate]] (''syngenesious'' anthers), thus forming a sort of tube around the style (''theca''). They commonly have basal and/or apical appendages. Pollen is released inside the tube and is collected around the growing style, and then, as the style elongates, is pushed out of the tube (''n\u00fcdelspritze'').\n\nThe [[pistil]] consists of two connate [[carpel]]s. The [[carpel|style]] has two lobes. Stigmatic tissue may be located in the interior surface or form two lateral lines. The [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is inferior and has only one [[ovule]], with basal [[placentation]].\n\n=== Fruits and seeds ===\nIn members of the Asteraceae the fruit is [[achene]]-like, and is called a ''cypsela'' (plural ''cypselae''). Although there are two fused [[carpel]]s, there is only one locule, and only one [[seed]] per fruit is formed.

There are many [[apomixis|apomictic]] species in the family.\n\nSeeds are ordinarily dispersed intact with the fruiting body, the cypsela. ''[[Seed dispersal#Wind|Anemochory]]'' (wind dispersal) is common, assisted by a hairy pappus. ''[[Seed dispersal#By animals|Epizoochory]]'' is another common method, in which the dispersal unit, a single cypsela (e.g. ''[[Bidens]]'') or entire capitulum (e.g. ''[[Arctium]]'') has hooks, spines or some structure to attach to the fur or plumage (or even clothes, as in the photo) of an animal just to fall off later far from its mother plant.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Senecio angulatus flowers.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The [[vine|twining]] [[succulent]], ''[[Senecio angulatus]]'', is used for its [[cut flowers]],<ref>https://landscapeplants.aub.edu.lb/Plants/GetPDF/dcc77b26-1656-4f5f-bbc3-a32e75aaa030  Senecio angulatus\n(Cape ivy, Climbing groundsel, Creeping groundsel)</ref> despite being an invasive [[weed]] in some places, such as Australia and New Zealand.<ref>[https://weeds.brisbane.qld.gov.au/weeds/climbing-groundsel  Senecio angulatus]</ref>]]\nCommercially important plants in Asteraceae include the food crops ''[[Lactuca sativa]]'' (lettuce), ''[[Cichorium]]'' (chicory), ''[[Cynara scolymus]]'' (globe artichoke), ''[[Helianthus annuus]]'' ([[sunflower]]), ''[[Smallanthus sonchifolius]]'' (yac\u00f3n), ''[[Carthamus tinctorius]]'' (safflower) and ''[[Helianthus tuberosus]]'' (Jerusalem artichoke). \n\nPlants are used as herbs and in [[herbal tea]]s and other beverages. Chamomile, for example, comes from two different species: the annual ''[[Matricaria chamomilla]]'' (German chamomile) and the perennial ''[[Chamaemelum nobile]]'' (Roman chamomile). ''[[Calendula]]'' (known as pot marigold) is grown commercially for herbal teas and [[potpourri]]. ''[[Echinacea purpurea|Echinacea]]'' is used as a medicinal tea. The wormwood genus ''[[Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]]'' includes [[absinthe]] (''A. absinthium'') and [[tarragon]] (''A. dracunculus''). Winter tarragon (''[[Tagetes lucida]]''), is commonly grown and used as a tarragon substitute in climates where tarragon will not survive.\n\nMany members of the family are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers, and some are important ornamental crops for the cut flower industry.

As a result, several of these genera have required multiple revisions.<ref name=\"Judd\">Judd, W.S., Campbell, C.S., Kellogg, E.A., Stevens, P.F. (2007) Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland.</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nMembers of the Asteraceae are mostly [[herbaceous plants]], but some shrubs, [[Vine|climbers]] and trees (such as ''[[Lachanodes arborea]]'') do exist. They are generally easy to distinguish from other plants, mainly because of their characteristic [[inflorescence]] and other shared characteristics.<ref name=\"Judd\" /> However, determining genera and species of some groups such as ''[[Hieracium#Species|Hieracium]]'' is notoriously difficult (see \"[[damned yellow composite]]\" for example).\n\n=== Roots and stems ===\nMembers of the Asteraceae generally produce [[taproot]]s, but sometimes they possess fibrous root systems. Stems are herbaceous aerial branched cylindrical with glandular hairs generally erect but can be prostrate to ascending. Some species have underground stems in the form of [[caudex|caudices]] or [[rhizome]]s. These can be fleshy or woody depending on the species.<ref name=\"Barkley et al.\" />\n\n=== Leaves ===\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] and the stems very often contain secretory canals with [[resin]] or [[latex]] (particularly common among the Cichorioideae). The leaves can be [[phyllotaxis|alternate]], [[phyllotaxis|opposite]], or [[phyllotaxis|whorled]]. They may be simple, but are often deeply [[leaf#Morphology|lobed]] or otherwise [[leaf#Morphology|incised]], often [[leaf#Morphology|conduplicate]] or [[leaf#Morphology|revolute]]. The margins can be entire or lobed or toothed.\n\n=== Flowers ===\n\n==== Floral heads ====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Bidens flwr.jpg\n| width1

what appears to be a single flower is actually a cluster of much smaller flowers.<ref name=CDF>Sia Morhardt, Emil Morhardt, California Desert Flowers, University of California Press, pp. 29\u201332</ref> The overall appearance of the cluster, as a single flower, functions in attracting [[pollinators]] in the same way as the structure of an individual flower in some other plant families.<ref name=CDF /> The older family name, Compositae, comes from the fact that what appears to be a single flower is actually a ''composite'' of smaller flowers.<ref name=CDF /> The \"petals\" or \"sunrays\" in a sunflower head are actually individual strap-shaped<ref name=MDW>Pam MacKay, Mojave Desert Wildflowers, illustration p. 35</ref> flowers called '''ray flowers''', and the \"sun disk\" is made of smaller circular shaped individual flowers called '''disc flowers'''.<ref name=CDF /> The word \"aster\" means \"star\" in Greek, referring to the appearance of some family members, as a \"star\" surrounded by \"rays\".<ref name=CDF /> The cluster of flowers that may appear to be a single flower, is called a ''head''.<ref name=CDF /> The entire head may move tracking the sun, like a \"smart\" solar panel, which maximizes reflectivity of the whole unit and can thereby attract more pollinators.<ref name=CDF />\nAt the base of the head, and surrounding the flowers before opening, is a bundle of [[sepal]]-like [[bract]]s or scales called [[phyllaries]], which together form the ''involucre'' that protects the individual flowers in the head before opening.<ref name=CDF /> The individual heads have the smaller individual flowers arranged on a round or dome-like structure called the ''receptacle''.<ref name=CDF /> The flowers mature first at the outside, moving toward the center, with the youngest in the middle.<ref name=CDF />\n\nThe individual flowers in a head have 5 fused petals (rarely 4), but instead of sepals, have threadlike, hairy, or bristly structures called ''[[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]]'', which surround the fruit and can stick to animal fur or be lifted by wind, aiding in seed dispersal.<ref name=CDF /> The whitish fluffy head of a dandelion, commonly blown on by children, is made of the pappus, with tiny seeds attached at the ends, whereby the pappus provides a parachute like structure to help the seed be carried away in the wind.<ref name=CDF />\n\n[[File:Ray-floret.svg|thumb|upright=.77|Ligulate floret: A&nbsp;=&nbsp;ovary, B&nbsp;=&nbsp;pappus, C&nbsp;=&nbsp;anthers, D&nbsp;=&nbsp;ligule, E&nbsp;=&nbsp;style with

other members.<ref name=CDF /> A ''ligule'' is the strap-shaped tongue of the [[petal|corolla]] of either a ray flower or of a ligulate flower.<ref name=MDW />  A ''disk flower'' (or ''disc flower'') is a radially symmetric (i.e., with identical shaped petals arranged in circle around the center) individual flower in the head, which is ringed by ray flowers when both are present.<ref name=CDF

flowers that are sterile, male, or have both male and female parts, it is a ''discoid head''.<ref name=CDF /> ''Disciform heads'' have only disc flowers, but may have two kinds (male flowers and female flowers) in one head, or may have different heads of two kinds (all male, or all female).<ref name=CDF /> ''Pistillate heads'' have all female flowers. ''Staminate heads'' have all male flowers.<ref name=CDF />\n\nSometimes, but rarely, the head contains only a single flower, or has a single flowered pistillate (female) head, and a multi-flowered male staminate (male) head.<ref name=CDF />\n\n==== Floral structures ====\n[[File:Carduus flowerdiagram.png|thumb|right|Flower diagram of ''[[Carduus]]'' (Carduoideae) shows (outermost to innermost): subtending bract and stem axis; fused calyx; fused corolla; stamens fused to corolla; gynoecium with two carpels and one [[locule]] ]]\nThe distinguishing characteristic of Asteraceae is their [[inflorescence]], a type of specialised, composite flower head or ''[[pseudanthium]]'', technically called a calathium or ''[[Pseudanthium|capitulum]]'',<ref name=Beentje>{{cite book|first=Henk|last=Beentje|year=2010|title=The Kew Plant Glossary, an illustrated dictionary of plant terms|publisher=Kew Publishing|location=Richmond, U.K.|isbn=9781842464229 }}</ref><ref>Usher, G. (1966) A dictionary of botany, including terms used in bio-chemistry, soil science, and statistics. {{LCCN|666025447}}</ref> that may look superficially like a single flower. The ''capitulum'' is a contracted [[raceme]] composed of numerous individual [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] [[flower]]s, called ''florets'', all sharing the same [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]].\n\nA set of [[bract]]s forms an [[involucral bract|involucre]] surrounding the base of the capitulum. These are called \"phyllaries\", or \"involucral bracts\". They may simulate the [[sepal]]s of the pseudanthium. These are mostly herbaceous but can also be brightly coloured (e.g. ''[[Helichrysum]]'') or have a scarious (dry and membranous) texture. The phyllaries can be free or fused, and arranged in one to many rows, overlapping like the tiles of a roof (''imbricate'') or not (this variation is important in identification of tribes and genera).\n\nEach floret may be subtended by a bract, called a \"palea\" or \"receptacular bract\". These bracts are often called \"[[chaff]]\". The presence or absence of these bracts, their distribution on the receptacle, and their size and shape are all important diagnostic characteristics for genera and tribes.\n\nThe florets have five [[petal]]s fused at the base to form a [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] tube and they may be either [[actinomorphic]] or [[zygomorphic]]. ''Disc florets'' are usually actinomorphic, with five petal lips on the rim of the corolla tube. The petal lips may be either very short, or long, in which case they form deeply lobed petals. The latter is the only kind of floret in the Carduoideae, while the first kind is more widespread. ''Ray florets'' are always highly zygomorphic and are characterised by the presence of a ''ligule'', a strap-shaped structure on the edge of the corolla tube consisting of fused petals. In the Asteroideae and other minor subfamilies these are usually borne only on florets at the circumference of the capitulum and have a 3+2 scheme &mdash; above the fused corolla tube, three very long fused [[petal]]s form the ligule, with the other two petals being inconspicuously small. The Cichorioideae has only ray florets, with a 5+0 scheme &mdash; all five petals form the ligule. A 4+1 scheme is found in the Barnadesioideae. The tip of the ligule is often divided into teeth, each one representing a petal. Some marginal florets may have no petals at all (filiform floret).\n\nThe [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] of the florets may be absent, but when present is always modified into a [[pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] of two or more teeth, scales or bristles and this is often involved in the dispersion of the seeds. As with the bracts, the nature of the pappus is an important diagnostic feature.\n\nThere are usually five [[stamen]]s. The filaments are fused to the corolla, while the anthers are generally [[connation|connate]] (''syngenesious'' anthers), thus forming a sort of tube around the style (''theca''). They commonly have basal and/or apical appendages. Pollen is released inside the tube and is collected around the growing style, and then, as the style elongates, is pushed out of the tube (''n\u00fcdelspritze'').\n\nThe [[pistil]] consists of two connate [[carpel]]s. The [[carpel|style]] has two lobes. Stigmatic tissue may be located in the interior surface or form two lateral lines. The [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is inferior and has only one [[ovule]], with basal [[placentation]].\n\n=== Fruits and seeds ===\nIn members of the Asteraceae the fruit is [[achene]]-like, and is called a ''cypsela'' (plural ''cypselae''). Although there are two fused [[carpel]]s, there is only one locule, and only one [[seed]] per fruit is formed. It may sometimes be winged or spiny because the [[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]], which is derived from [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]] tissue often remains on the fruit (for example in [[dandelion]]). In some species, however, the pappus falls off (for example in ''[[Helianthus]]''). Cypsela [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] is often used to help determine plant relationships at the genus and species level.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden | pages = 569\u2013594 | url = <!-- http://apt.allenpress.com/aptonline/?request=get-abstract&issn=0026-6493&volume=092&issue=04&page=0569 -->http://cel.webofknowledge.com/InboundService.do?product=CEL&SID=S1JkbNkVD3FqTrQJUhx&UT=000234320700004&SrcApp=Highwire&action=retrieve&Init=Yes&Func=Frame&SrcAuth=Highwire&customersID=Highwire&IsProductCode=Yes&mode=FullRecord | title = Morphology Of Cypselae In Subtribe Arctotidinae (Compositae\u2013Arctotideae) And Its Taxonomic Implications | author = McKenzie, R.J. | author2 = Samuel, J. | author3 = Muller, E.M. | author4 = Skinner, A.K.W. | author5 = Barker, N.P. | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | year = 2005 | jstor = 40035740 | access-date = 21 April 2014 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20140421054746/http://cel.webofknowledge.com/InboundService.do?product=CEL&SID=S1JkbNkVD3FqTrQJUhx&UT=000234320700004&SrcApp=Highwire&action=retrieve&Init=Yes&Func=Frame&SrcAuth=Highwire&customersID=Highwire&IsProductCode=Yes&mode=FullRecord | archive-date = 21 April 2014 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The mature [[seed]]s usually have little [[endosperm]] or none.<ref name=\"Judd\" />\n=== Pollen ===\nThe pollen of composites is typically echinolophate, a [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] term meaning \"with elaborate systems of ridges and spines dispersed around and between the apertures.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tomb |first1=A.

(2015) estimated that the [[crown group]] of Asteraceae evolved at least 85.9 Mya (Late Cretaceous, [[Santonian]]) with a stem node age of 88-89 Mya (Late Cretaceous, [[Coniacian]]).<ref name=PNAS2015 />\n\nIt is still unknown whether the precise cause of their great success was the development of the highly specialised capitulum, their ability to store energy as [[fructan]]s (mainly [[inulin]]), which is an advantage in relatively dry zones, or some combination of these and possibly other factors.<ref name=\"Stevens\" />\n\n== Ecology ==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Kih-silberdistel.jpg\n| width1    = {{#expr: trunc (150 * 800 / 532)}}\n| caption1  = Anemochory in ''[[Carlina]]''\n| image2    = Epizoochoria NRM.jpg\n| width2    = {{#expr: trunc (150 * 800 / 600)}}\n| caption2  = Epizoochory in ''[[Bidens tripartita]]''\n}}\nAsteraceans are especially common in open and dry environments.<ref name=\"Judd\" />\n\nMany members of Asteraceae are [[pollination|pollinated]] by insects, which explains their value in attracting [[beneficial insects]], but [[pollination syndrome|anemophily]] is also present (e.g. ''[[Ragweed|Ambrosia]]'', ''[[Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]]''). There are many [[apomixis|apomictic]] species in the family.\n\nSeeds are ordinarily dispersed intact with the fruiting body, the cypsela. ''[[Seed dispersal#Wind|Anemochory]]'' (wind dispersal) is common, assisted by a hairy pappus. ''[[Seed dispersal#By animals|Epizoochory]]'' is another common method, in which the dispersal unit, a single cypsela (e.g. ''[[Bidens]]'') or entire capitulum (e.g. ''[[Arctium]]'') has hooks, spines or some structure to attach to the fur or plumage (or even clothes, as in the photo) of an animal just to fall off later far from its mother plant.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Senecio angulatus flowers.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The [[vine|twining]] [[succulent]], ''[[Senecio angulatus]]'', is used for its [[cut flowers]],<ref>https://landscapeplants.aub.edu.lb/Plants/GetPDF/dcc77b26-1656-4f5f-bbc3-a32e75aaa030  Senecio angulatus\n(Cape ivy, Climbing groundsel, Creeping groundsel)</ref> despite being an invasive [[weed]] in some places, such as Australia and New Zealand.<ref>[https://weeds.brisbane.qld.gov.au/weeds/climbing-groundsel  Senecio angulatus]</ref>]]\nCommercially important plants in Asteraceae include the food crops ''[[Lactuca sativa]]'' (lettuce), ''[[Cichorium]]'' (chicory), ''[[Cynara scolymus]]'' (globe artichoke), ''[[Helianthus annuus]]'' ([[sunflower]]), ''[[Smallanthus sonchifolius]]'' (yac\u00f3n), ''[[Carthamus tinctorius]]'' (safflower) and ''[[Helianthus tuberosus]]'' (Jerusalem artichoke). \n\nPlants are used as herbs and in [[herbal tea]]s and other beverages. Chamomile, for example, comes from two different species: the annual ''[[Matricaria chamomilla]]'' (German chamomile) and the perennial ''[[Chamaemelum nobile]]'' (Roman chamomile). ''[[Calendula]]'' (known as pot marigold) is grown commercially for herbal teas and [[potpourri]]. ''[[Echinacea purpurea|Echinacea]]'' is used as a medicinal tea. The wormwood genus ''[[Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]]'' includes [[absinthe]] (''A. absinthium'') and [[tarragon]] (''A. dracunculus''). Winter tarragon (''[[Tagetes lucida]]''), is commonly grown and used as a tarragon substitute in climates where tarragon will not survive.\n\nMany members of the family are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers, and some are important ornamental crops for the cut flower industry. Some examples are ''[[Chrysanthemum]]'', ''[[Gerbera]]'', ''[[Calendula]]'', ''[[Dendranthema]]'', ''[[Argyranthemum]]'', ''[[Dahlia]]'', ''[[Tagetes]]'', ''[[Zinnia]]'', and many others.<ref name=\"Aphididae\">{{Citation |title=Diversity of Host Plants of Aphids (Homoptera: Aphididae) Infesting Asteraceae in India | author=Rajendra Singh |display-authors=etal | journal=International Journal of Zoological Investigations | year=2015 | volume=1 | issue=2 | pages=137\u2013167 }}</ref>\n\nMany species of this family possess medicinal properties and are used as traditional [[parasite|antiparasitic]] medicine. <ref name=\"PandaLuyten2018\"/>\n\nMembers of the family are also commonly featured in medical and phytochemical journals because the [[sesquiterpene]] [[lactone]] compounds contained within them are an important cause of [[allergic contact dermatitis]].

He is the head coach of the [[Seattle Sounders FC]], who play in [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS), having been assistant coach for the team until [[Sigi Schmid]]'s departure in 2016. Prior to that, he coached the [[Seattle Sounders (1994\u20132008)|Seattle Sounders]] in the [[USL First Division]] for seven seasons, winning two championships, and played in the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]], [[Major Indoor Soccer League (1978\u201392)|Major Indoor Soccer League]] and [[Western Soccer League]] for various Seattle teams.\n\n==Youth career==\nSchmetzer was born and grew up in [[Seattle]] where he attended [[Nathan Hale High School (Washington)|Nathan Hale High School]].  He learned to play soccer under the tutelage of his father Walter, who coached him with the Lake City Hawks youth team and led them to multiple state championships. Walter, a native of [[Germany]], had played in the German [[Regionalliga (football)|Third Division]] before immigrating to the United States in 1962, opening a sporting goods store in [[Lake City, Seattle|Lake City]].

He appeared in the documentary ''[[Hello London]]'' (1958).\n\nReed's first break was playing [[Richard of Gloucester]] in a 6-part BBC TV series ''[[The Golden Spur]]'' (1959).

The show had many other problems, and a fellow-guest revealed that Reed recognised this when he arrived and virtually had to be dragged in front of the cameras.

It currently appears to be two waterfalls most of the time but when the river is swollen due to summer rains can form one fall again.\n\nIn Vietnamese, the two falls are considered as two parts of one waterfall with the sole name B\u1ea3n Gi\u1ed1c. The two parts are th\u00e1c ch\u00ednh (Main waterfall) and th\u00e1c ph\u1ee5 (Subordinate waterfall).

Rediscovered only recently, it has many species of [[Endemism|endemic]] plants, found only in the gorge.\n\n===Geology===\nThe waterfalls are located in an area of mature [[karst]] formations where the original limestone bedrock layers are being eroded. Numerous streams spring from underground fissures along the lower levels of the area. The waterfalls have multiple drops, from bedrock layer to layer, which shows the multiple depositions of sediments of different hardness which formed the terrain over millions of years.\n\n==History==\n{{POV section|date=April 2017}}\n\nA road running along the top of the falls leads to a stone marker that demarcates the border between China and Vietnam in French and Chinese. Modern disputes arose as there are discrepancies as to the correlating legal documents on border demarcation and the placement of markers between the French and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] administrations in the 19th century.<ref name=\"VN Embassy\">Vietnamese Embassy: On the settlement of Vietnam-China border issue [http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/news/story.php?d=20020916000456 vietnamembassy-usa.org]</ref>\n\nDisputes regarding the border demarcation at this location were settled in ''1999 Viet Nam-China Treaty on Land Borderline''.
