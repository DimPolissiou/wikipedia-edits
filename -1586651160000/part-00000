Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club.

These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects.

In his first appearance at Augusta in 1981, he led during the second nine but ended up finishing fourth.

After making his final putt to win, he broke down sobbing at the hole and was consoled and embraced by his caddie.  In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick. (The \"15th club\" reference is based on the golf rule that limits a player to carrying 14 clubs during a round.)

Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship]], and the [[PGA Championship]]) for the next five years (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Officially known as the \"Masters Club\", it includes only past winners of the Masters, although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members, usually the chairman.\n\nThe defending champion, as host, selects the menu for the dinner. Frequently, Masters champions have served cuisine from their home regions prepared by the Masters chef. Notable examples have included [[haggis]], served by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Sandy Lyle]] in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html#dinner |title=Masters Club |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109192302/http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[bobotie]], a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion [[Trevor Immelman]]. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder [[Clifford Roberts]] is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff.

Scheduled for the first full week of April, the Masters is the first major of the year, and unlike the others, it is always held at the same location, [[Augusta National Golf Club]], a private course in the [[southeastern United States]], in the city of [[Augusta, Georgia]].\n\nThe Masters was started by [[Amateur sports#Golf|amateur]] champion [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] and [[Investment banking|investment banker]] [[Clifford Roberts]].<ref name=\"Hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.com/en_US/tournament/milestones/index.html |title=Masters Milestones |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=February 9, 2016}}</ref> After his [[Grand Slam (golf)|grand slam]] in [[1930 U.S. Open (golf)|1930]], Jones acquired the former [[plant nursery]] and co-designed Augusta National with course architect [[Alister MacKenzie]].<ref name=itcpgat11/> First played {{Years or months ago|1934}} in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]], the tournament is an official money event on the [[PGA Tour]], the [[European Tour]], and the [[Japan Golf Tour]]. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

In his first appearance at Augusta in 1981, he led during the second nine but ended up finishing fourth. In 1986, after birdieing holes 14 through 17 to tie Nicklaus for the lead, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 into the patrons surrounding the green and missed his par putt for a closing bogey.  In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff when [[Larry Mize]] holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole.

Norman finished in the top five at the Masters eight times but never won.\n\nTwo-time champion [[Ben Crenshaw]] captured an emotional Masters win in 1995, just days after the death of his lifelong teacher and mentor [[Harvey Penick]].   After making his final putt to win, he broke down sobbing at the hole and was consoled and embraced by his caddie.  In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick. (The \"15th club\" reference is based on the golf rule that limits a player to carrying 14 clubs during a round.)  Crenshaw first won at Augusta in 1984.\n\nIn 1997, 21 year-old [[Tiger Woods]] became the youngest champion in Masters history, winning by 12 shots with an 18-under par 270 which broke the 72-hole record that had stood for 32 years.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> In 2001 Woods completed his \"Tiger Slam\" by winning his fourth straight major championship at the Masters by two shots over [[David Duval]]. <ref name=past-results/> He won again the following year, making him only the third player in history (after Nicklaus and Faldo) to win the tournament in consecutive years,<ref name=past-results/> as well as in 2005 when he defeated [[Chris DiMarco]] in a playoff for his first major championship win in almost three years.<ref name=past-results/>\n\nThe club was targeted by [[Martha Burk]], who organized a failed protest at the 2003 Masters to pressure the club into accepting female members.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament in a televised ceremony, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the year after their victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they are present on the club grounds. [[Sam Snead]] was the first Masters champion to be awarded the green jacket after he took his first Masters title in 1949.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from the Augusta National grounds by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/golf/2017/04/10/masters-style-green-jacket-bought-for-5-at-toronto-thrift-store-sells-for-139k.html |title=Masters-style green jacket bought for $5 at Toronto thrift store sells for $139K |newspaper=Toronto Star |agency=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Trophies====\nWinners also have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy.

The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

After the arrangement continued into 2004, the tournament reinstated sponsorships for 2005, with the new partners of ExxonMobil, IBM, and SBC.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/aug/28/sports/sp-masters28 |title=Masters Is Back to Commercials |last=Stewart |first=Larry |date=2004-08-28 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2018-04-08 |issn=0458-3035 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/2003/04/08/8104128/the-battle-of-augusta-hootie-vs-martha-a-chronology-of-developments-in-golfs-most-famous-feud-between-martha-burk-the-chairwoman-of-the-national-council-of-womens-organizations-ncwo-and-hootie-johnson-the-chairman-of-augusta-na |title=The Battle of Augusta Hootie vs. Martha: A Chronology of Developments in Golf's Most Famous Feud, Between Martha Burk, the Chairwoman of the National Council Of Women's Organizations (NCWO), and Hootie Johnson, the Chairman of Augusta National Golf Club  |last=Yen |first=Yi-Wyn |magazine=Sports Illustrated |date=April 8, 2003 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe club also sells separate sponsorship packages, which do not provide rights to air commercials on the U.S. telecasts, to two \"international partners\"; in 2014, those companies were [[Rolex]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] (the latter of which replaced Mercedes-Benz upon that company's elevation to \"global sponsor\" status).<ref name=\"2014 sponsors\"/>\n\n===Radio coverage===\nWestwoodOne (previously [[Dial Global]] and [[CBS Radio Network|CBS Radio]]) has provided live radio play-by-play coverage in the United States since 1956.

Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for the actions I have recently performed. I do not really understand myself these days. I am supposed to be an average reasonable and intelligent young man.

These thoughts constantly recur, and it requires a tremendous mental effort to concentrate on useful and progressive tasks.<ref name=\"letter\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn his note, he went on to request an [[autopsy]] be performed on his remains after he was dead to determine if there had been a discernible biological contributory cause for his actions and for his continuing and increasingly intense headaches. He also wrote that he had decided to kill both his mother and wife. Expressing uncertainty about his reasons, he nonetheless stated he did not believe his mother had \"ever enjoyed life as she is entitled to\",<ref name=\"Time-Life Books 1993 51\"/> and that his wife had \"been as fine a wife to me as any man could ever hope to have\". Whitman further explained that he wanted to relieve both his wife and mother of the suffering of this world, and to save them the embarrassment of his actions. He did not mention planning the attack at the university.<ref name=\"helmer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/madman-tower?fullpage=1|title=The Madman on the Tower|last=Helmer|first=William|date=August 1986|publisher=texasmonthly.com}}</ref>\n\nJust after midnight on August 1, Whitman drove to his mother's apartment at 1212 Guadalupe Street.

His wife, Elizabeth, died a little over a year later, in her mid-30s, leaving Orlando's eldest brother, Edward, to care for the orphaned children. Of these children only the eldest son, [[Christopher Gibbons]], became a musician.\n\n==Music==\nOne of the most versatile English composers of his time, Gibbons wrote a large number of keyboard works, around thirty [[Fantasia (music)|fantasias]] for [[viol]]s, a number of [[madrigal]]s (the best-known being \"[[The Silver Swan (song)|The Silver Swan]]\"), and many popular [[verse anthem]]s, all to English texts (the best known being \"Great Lord of Lords\"). Perhaps his best-known verse anthem is ''[[This Is the Record of John]]'', which sets an [[Advent]] text for solo [[countertenor]] or [[tenor]], alternating with full chorus. The soloist is required to demonstrate considerable technical facility, and the work expresses the text's rhetorical force without being demonstrative or bombastic. He also produced two major settings of [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]], the Short Service and the Second Service, an extended composition combining verse and full sections. Gibbons's full anthems include the expressive ''O Lord, in thy wrath'', and the [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Day]] anthem ''O clap your hands together'' (after Psalm 47) for eight voices.\n\nHe contributed six pieces to the first printed collection of keyboard music in England, ''[[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]]'' (to which he was by far the youngest of the three contributors), published in about 1611. Gibbons's surviving keyboard output comprises some 45 pieces. The polyphonic fantasia and dance forms are the best represented genres. Gibbons's writing exhibits a command of three- and four-part counterpoint. Most of the fantasias are complex, multi-sectional pieces, treating multiple subjects imitatively. Gibbons's approach to melody, in both his fantasias and his dances, features extensive development of simple musical ideas, as for example in ''Pavane in D minor'' and ''Lord Salisbury's Pavan and Galliard''.<ref>[[Willi Apel|Apel, Willi]]. 1972.

Then here upon (his death being so sudden) rumours were cast out that he did die of the plague, whereupon we . . . caused his body to be searched by certain women that were sworn to deliver the truth, who did affirm that they never saw a fairer corpse. Yet notwithstanding we to give full satisfaction to all did cause the skull to be opened in our presence & we carefully viewed the body, which we found also to be very clean without any show or spot of any contagious matter. In the brain we found the whole & sole cause of his sickness namely a great admirable blackness & syderation in the outside of the brain.

His wife, Elizabeth, died a little over a year later, in her mid-30s, leaving Orlando's eldest brother, Edward, to care for the orphaned children. Of these children only the eldest son, [[Christopher Gibbons]], became a musician.\n\n==Music==\nOne of the most versatile English composers of his time, Gibbons wrote a large number of keyboard works, around thirty [[Fantasia (music)|fantasias]] for [[viol]]s, a number of [[madrigal]]s (the best-known being \"[[The Silver Swan (song)|The Silver Swan]]\"), and many popular [[verse anthem]]s, all to English texts (the best known being \"Great Lord of Lords\"). Perhaps his best-known verse anthem is ''[[This Is the Record of John]]'', which sets an [[Advent]] text for solo [[countertenor]] or [[tenor]], alternating with full chorus. The soloist is required to demonstrate considerable technical facility, and the work expresses the text's rhetorical force without being demonstrative or bombastic. He also produced two major settings of [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]], the Short Service and the Second Service, an extended composition combining verse and full sections. Gibbons's full anthems include the expressive ''O Lord, in thy wrath'', and the [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Day]] anthem ''O clap your hands together'' (after Psalm 47) for eight voices.\n\nHe contributed six pieces to the first printed collection of keyboard music in England, ''[[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]]'' (to which he was by far the youngest of the three contributors), published in about 1611. Gibbons's surviving keyboard output comprises some 45 pieces. The polyphonic fantasia and dance forms are the best represented genres. Gibbons's writing exhibits a command of three- and four-part counterpoint. Most of the fantasias are complex, multi-sectional pieces, treating multiple subjects imitatively. Gibbons's approach to melody, in both his fantasias and his dances, features extensive development of simple musical ideas, as for example in ''Pavane in D minor'' and ''Lord Salisbury's Pavan and Galliard''.<ref>[[Willi Apel|Apel, Willi]]. 1972.

Then here upon (his death being so sudden) rumours were cast out that he did die of the plague, whereupon we . . . caused his body to be searched by certain women that were sworn to deliver the truth, who did affirm that they never saw a fairer corpse. Yet notwithstanding we to give full satisfaction to all did cause the skull to be opened in our presence & we carefully viewed the body, which we found also to be very clean without any show or spot of any contagious matter. In the brain we found the whole & sole cause of his sickness namely a great admirable blackness & syderation in the outside of the brain.

The airport is located {{convert|6|NM|abbr=on|lk=in}} southwest of Stavanger, in the municipality of [[Sola]].<ref name=\"aip_enzv\"/> It is Norway's [[list of the largest airports in the Nordic countries|third-busiest airport]], with both [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[helicopter]] traffic for the offshore [[North Sea oil]] installations. In addition, the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] operates [[Westland Sea King]] [[search and rescue]] helicopters from [[Sola Air Station]].\n\nThe airport had 85 306 air movements and 4,501,368 passengers in 2015. {{Cn|date=March 2020}} Five airlines offered domestic flights to nine destinations while ten airlines offered international flights to 37 destinations. Two helicopter companies operate out of Sola. The busiest route is Sola\u2013Oslo Gardermoen, which has about 28 daily flights. In the vicinity of the airport there is an aeronautical museum, [[Flyhistorisk Museum, Sola]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===The facilities===\nStavanger Airport, Sola is Norway's second oldest airport, opened by [[King Haakon VII]] 29 May 1937. The airport was the second to have a [[concrete]] [[runway]] in [[Europe]]. The airport was attacked and captured by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (Nazi Germany)|fallschirmj\u00e4gers]] from 1st battalion of the 1st Regiment, [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|7th Flieger Division]] supported by [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft on 9 April 1940. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The attack was over in an hour, and the airport remained in German hands for the duration of [[World War II]]. During the war, the German occupation forces and Luftwaffe expanded the airport considerably, as it was a vital strategic asset for the Germans. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Former anti-aircraft positions are also still visible along the neighboring beach [[Solastranda]].\n\nOriginally, the idea was to locate the Stavanger airport at [[Stavanger Airport, Forus|Forus]], but after the war the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] decided to use Sola temporarily until the new airport was built, and nothing ever became of Forus. [[Sola Air Station]] has since been of vital importance for the Norwegian armed forces, but gradually lost assignments, and in 1982 the last fighter squadron left the airport.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nStavanger Airport has two passenger terminals, one for [[airplanes]] and one for [[helicopters]]. When the present terminal was put into use 28 January 1987, it was the first airport in Norway to have [[jet bridge]]s, nine in total. {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} The old terminal was demolished and made way for taxiway H The airport has two crossing runways: the main runway, north/south (18/36) and the main runway for helicopters, which is oriented northwest\u2013southeast (11/29).\n\nExpansion of the airplane terminal took place in 2009. The new gates were built without jetbridges. The airport's two largest airlines, SAS and Norwegian, showed little interest in such amenity and desired quicker turnaround times.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/bildegallerier/article963503.ece|title=Ingen gangbruer til flyene|last=Helgesen|first=Jan Petter|date=December 19, 2008|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001060119/http://www.aftenbladet.no/bildegallerier/article963503.ece|archive-date=October 1, 2009|df=}}</ref> SAS though later said that they did want jetbridges for their larger jet aircraft, and only wanted gates without jetbridges for their smaller turboprop aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/977597/Uakseptabelt_for_SAS.html|title=Uakseptabelt for SAS|last=Helgesen|first=Jan Petter|date=January 24, 2009|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205233026/http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/977597/Uakseptabelt_for_SAS.html|archive-date=February 5, 2009|df=}}</ref> The lack of jetbridges angered the societies representing the disabled and multiple sclerosis afflicted, and prompting several Rogaland politicians to put pressure on Avinor to reconsider the building.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/980883/Fylket_ber_Navarsete_legge_press_paa_Avinor.html|title=Fylket ber Navarsete legge press p\u00e5 Avinor|last=Tollaksen|first=Tor Gunnar|date=February 1, 2009|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916214648/http://aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/980883/Fylket_ber_Navarsete_legge_press_paa_Avinor.html|archive-date=September 16, 2009|df=}}</ref> In April 2009, Avinor decided not to build jetbridges.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://aftenbladet.no/lokalt/1011198/Rasende__paa_Avinor.html|title=Rasende p\u00e5 Avinor|last=Helgesen|first=Jan Petter|date=April 6, 2009|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407075421/http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/1011198/Rasende__paa_Avinor.html|archive-date=April 7, 2009|df=}}</ref>\n\nOffshore helicopter flights out of Stavanger commenced in 1966. Instead of operating out of Sola, the operator [[Helikopter Service]] decided to operate their services out of [[Stavanger Airport, Forus]], a closed-down airport built during the [[Second World War]].<ref>Olsen-Hagen: 35</ref> Throughout the 1970s and 1980s this became an increasingly problematic solution, not least due to increased development of the area. It eventually became inevitable to relocate the base to Sola.<ref>Olsen-Hagen: 37</ref> To allow for the transfer, the airport authority built a new, separate helicopter terminal at Sola, costing 56 million [[Norwegian krone]]r. It opened on 7 March 1989, at the same time as operations ceased out of Forus. At the same time Helikopter Service built an operations center at the airport, including a hangar and maintenance center. In total the relocation from Forus cost about 120 million kroner.\n<ref>Olsen-Hagen: 39</ref>\n\n===Civilian airlines===\n[[File:Opening of Sola Airport.jpg|thumb|Sola Airport being opened, to the right a [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] [[Junkers G.38]]]]\n\n[[Det Norske Luftfartsselskap]] (DNL, later [[Scandinavian Airlines|Scandinavian Airlines System]] or SAS) started flying to Sola after the war, as did [[Braathens SAFE]] in 1946 on its routes to Europe and the Far East with the [[Douglas DC-3]] aircraft. In 1952, Braathens SAFE received [[concession (contract)|concession]] to fly the routes [[Oslo]]\u2013Stavanger, Oslo\u2013[[Kristiansand]]\u2013Stavanger and the coastal route Stavanger\u2013[[Bergen]]\u2013[[\u00c5lesund]]\u2013[[Trondheim]]\u2013[[Bod\u00f8]]\u2013[[Troms\u00f8]]. [[Wider\u00f8e]] established itself at Sola in the late 1980s after they bought [[Sandefjord Airport, Torp]]-based [[Norsk Air]].  For a time, [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]] operated intercontinental nonstop flights between Stavanger and [[Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] (IAH) located in Texas in the U.S., with this service being operated by [[PrivatAir]] with [[Boeing 737-700]] jetliners configured with 44 business class seats.<ref>[http://airlineroute.net/2015/09/15/sk-iahewr-w15/ airlineroute.net - SAS Cancels Stavanger \u2013 Houston Route] 15 September 2015</ref>\n\nWhen the oil exploration in the Norwegian part of the [[North Sea]] started in 1967, there was a sudden need for helicopter transport out to the [[oil platforms]]. The first helicopter service was [[Helikopter Service]], later renamed CHC Helikopter Service, who started operations with 2 [[Sikorsky S-61]]Ns initially from a makeshift heliport at [[Stavanger Airport, Forus]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The offshore helicopter operations were moved to the Sola in 1989. [[Braathens Helikopter]], a sister company of Braathens SAFE, also operated helicopters from Sola in the period 1989\u20131994, but was then sold to Helikopter Service. [[Norsk Helikopter]], later renamed [[Bristow Norway]], started their offshore flying at Sola in 1993. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Bristow Norway is now the biggest helicopter company in Sola, with the average of 28 departures each day Monday\u2013Friday. {{Cn|date=March 2020}} CHC Helicopter Service has the average of 8 departures each day Monday\u2013Friday. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Foreign airlines===\n[[British Airways]] predecessors had started operating at Sola after [[World War II]], in 1980 they started regular flights with [[British Aircraft Corporation]][[BAC One-Eleven]] jet aircraft to [[London Heathrow Airport]]. Later, the route was operated with [[Boeing 737]]-200/-300/-400s. For a period the [[Boeing 737-400]] morning flight continued to [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle]] after [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] as an extension of the flight. British Airways later started operating [[Boeing 757-200]]s with [[Boeing 737-200]]s flying new services twice daily to [[London Gatwick Airport|London\u2013Gatwick]]. In 1994, British Airways employees at Sola were transferred to Braathens SAFE as part of new cooperation between the two airlines. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} However, in 1997, [[KLM]] bought 30% of Braathens (as the airline was renamed) and British Airways closed its Stavanger routes, because it lacked its own staff. {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Today British Airways operates 2 daily rotations\nutilising [[Airbus A319]] jet aircraft from [[London Heathrow Airport]] in competition with SAS Scandinavian Airlines (Also 2 rotations) to [[London Heathrow Airport]], Norwegian operates a daily rotation to London, Gatwick. [[Dan-Air]] flew the route London\u2013Gatwick \u2013 [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] \u2013 Stavanger, until they were taken over by British Airways in 1992. [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] has flown to Newcastle as well. [[Eastern Airways]] operating [[Embraer ERJ-145]] and [[ERJ-135]] regional jets and [[Wider\u00f8e]] using [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] Dash-8-402Q ([[Q400]]) propjets both fly to Newcastle, U.K.\n\nThe oil industry has also required scheduled routes between Stavanger and [[Scotland]], primarily to British oil center in [[Aberdeen]]. In addition to SAS, [[Air Anglia]] (later [[AirUK]], [[KLMuk]]) flew the route. Today, this route is flown by [[Scandinavian Airlines]], [[Wider\u00f8e]] and [[Eastern Airways]]. In the 1970s, [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]] started flights to Stavanger from [[Amsterdam]]. They have used the [[Douglas DC-9-10]], [[Boeing 737]], [[Fokker 100]], [[Fokker F27]] and [[Fokker 50]] aircraft, and this route was the first operated by KLM with [[Fokker 70]]s (their first Fokker 70 is named \"City of Stavanger\"). The route was operated by Braathens between 1997 and 2002. Today, this route is flown by the KLM five times daily by [[Boeing 737]], [[Fokker 70]] and [[Embraer ERJ-190]] aircraft, the latter two aircraft operated by [[KLM Cityhopper]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n[[Air France]] also operated to Stavanger, initially routing [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle]] - Stavanger - Gothenburg using [[Boeing 737]]s. The route later became a twice-daily direct Paris - Stavanger connection using [[Embraer ERJ-170]] jet aircraft, until it was discontinued in October 2015.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://airlineroute.net/2015/05/21/af-europe-w15/ |title=AIRFRANCE Ends 3 European Routes in W15 |publisher=Airline Route |accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Norwegian authorities have denied, among others, [[Northwest Airlines]] (since merged into [[Delta Air Lines]]) the right to start flying intercontinental flights from the [[United States]]. [[Lufthansa]] started in 2003 to fly twice daily to its [[airline hub|hub]] in [[Frankfurt]] in [[Germany]] with the [[Canadair Regional Jet|Canadair RJ-700]] aircraft, but ceased flying the route in October 2015.\n\nIn 2005, work to upgrade the terminal building started. A new domestic arrival hall was opened in the summer of 2005, followed by the refurbishing of the international arrival hall. A new international lounge finished in 2006 and a new baggage sorting system, and an extension of the check-in areas was completed in 2007. Avinor is working on the [[instrument landing system]] category II/LVTO approach system at the airport. This will allow planes to land with as little as 300 meters of horizontal visibility. {{Cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nOn 15 February 2010, Scandinavian Airlines announced that Wider\u00f8e would take over their regional routes connecting airports in Western Norway, including the route from Stavanger to Kristiansand. SAS will retire their five Fokker 50 aircraft by November 2010, and Wider\u00f8e will take over the operations and 75 employees, and serve the routes using Q300 and Q400 aircraft.<ref>{{cite news

The [[330 Squadron]] operated [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] [[search and rescue]] helicopters are the only squadron left at the airport, but still a number of military aircraft can be seen at the airport. [[NATO]]'s [[E-3 Sentry|AWACS]] aircraft, VIP transports, airlift command and fighter and attack aircraft are regular visitors. Technicians and equipment at the Sola AFB facilitate turnover and housing of fighters, predominately the RNoAF F-16A Fighting Falcons, as well as F-16s and other aircraft from NATO allies. Facilitating the Marines and Airforces training base, NATO FORSACS and NATO Joint Warfare Centre amongst others.\n\nThe Sola AFB is a NATO 24-hour readiness base for deployment of aircraft and military personnel in the event of a military escalated tension or conflict.\n\n==Technical facilities==\nSola has quite a number of technical facilities, and has the largest aviation technical environment in Norway, including the largest helicopter maintenance facilities in Northern Europe, Braathens had its technical main base at Sola, as does Norwegian Air Shuttle, CHC Helikopter Service, Heli-One Norway, Bristow Norway, Norsk Helikopterservice, [[Norcopter]], [[Pratt & Whitney]] Norway Engine Centre and the air force's helicopter main technical base. The former Braathens hangars now house SAS Technical Services, Norwegian Technical Services (which has their technical main base for their Boeing 737 fleet here) and Norsk Helikopterservice is to move into the former Braathens paint-hangar. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Heli-One (when part of Helikopter Service) had final assembly of most of the Bell 412 helicopters when introduced to the RNoAF. Both Bristow and Heli-One have their heavy duty maintenance facilities for their Sikorsky S-92A at the airport. Heli-One also specialises in the maintenance of the Turbomecca engines and the gearbox of the Super Puma. The airport also has the only Norwegian education school for aircraft mechanics, they are certified by Eurocopter qualifying them to make conversions of Eurocopter helicopters, they perform heavy duty maintenance tasks for many operators and air forces of foreign nations.\n\nOn 16 June 2006 the board of SAS decided to close the SAS owned Braathens Technical Services at Sola, which resulted in over 300 job losses. This was despite Beaathens Technical Services being the only profit making heavy maintenance center in the SAS Group and award winner in achievements, the SAS unions having the upper hand since SAS acquired Braathens. Braathens Technical Services undertook services for many customers including Boeing. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nOn 31 March 2012 the board of Pratt & Whitney also decided to close the Pratt & Whitney Norway Engine Center.<ref>http://www.aftenbladet.no/okonomi/195-ansatte-mister-jobben-450960b.html</ref> The last engine left the shop on 20 June 2012.

Although the orientation isn` t ideal for operating planes from both runways, they are both most commonly active at the same time, 18/36 for planes and 11/29 for helicopters operating from it, having to keep well within the bounds of their intersection allowing for helicopters to operate from 29 to taxiway H, and departure from 11 from taxiway H, utilising both directions for helicopters, hotel and to the outer edge. Runway 18\u201336 has a CAT II landing system, enabling landing in very poor visibility. 11/29 only has ILS from one direction, 29, 11 is less frequently used, among other considerations to reduce noise emissions and flying over built areas, catering for population living in central parts of Sola municipality.\n\n==Accidents==\n''See [[1961 Holtaheia Vickers Viking crash]].''\n\nOn 9 August 1961 [[Vickers VC.1 Viking]] 3B (registration: G-AHPM), operated by Cunard Eagle Airways (later [[British Eagle]]) crashed on into a mountain near [[Holta]] on approach to Stavanger Airport, Sola from [[London Heathrow]] airport with the deaths of all 39 on board: 3 crew, 34 schoolboys from [[The Archbishop Lanfranc School]] in [[Thornton Heath]], London, plus two members of staff from the school.

The airport is located {{convert|6|NM|abbr=on|lk=in}} southwest of Stavanger, in the municipality of [[Sola]].<ref name=\"aip_enzv\"/> It is Norway's [[list of the largest airports in the Nordic countries|third-busiest airport]], with both [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[helicopter]] traffic for the offshore [[North Sea oil]] installations. In addition, the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] operates [[Westland Sea King]] [[search and rescue]] helicopters from [[Sola Air Station]].\n\nThe airport had 85 306 air movements and 4,501,368 passengers in 2015. {{Cn|date=March 2020}} Five airlines offered domestic flights to nine destinations while ten airlines offered international flights to 37 destinations. Two helicopter companies operate out of Sola. The busiest route is Sola\u2013Oslo Gardermoen, which has about 28 daily flights. In the vicinity of the airport there is an aeronautical museum, [[Flyhistorisk Museum, Sola]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===The facilities===\nStavanger Airport, Sola is Norway's second oldest airport, opened by [[King Haakon VII]] 29 May 1937. The airport was the second to have a [[concrete]] [[runway]] in [[Europe]]. The airport was attacked and captured by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (Nazi Germany)|fallschirmj\u00e4gers]] from 1st battalion of the 1st Regiment, [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|7th Flieger Division]] supported by [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft on 9 April 1940. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The attack was over in an hour, and the airport remained in German hands for the duration of [[World War II]]. During the war, the German occupation forces and Luftwaffe expanded the airport considerably, as it was a vital strategic asset for the Germans. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Former anti-aircraft positions are also still visible along the neighboring beach [[Solastranda]].\n\nOriginally, the idea was to locate the Stavanger airport at [[Stavanger Airport, Forus|Forus]], but after the war the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] decided to use Sola temporarily until the new airport was built, and nothing ever became of Forus. [[Sola Air Station]] has since been of vital importance for the Norwegian armed forces, but gradually lost assignments, and in 1982 the last fighter squadron left the airport.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nStavanger Airport has two passenger terminals, one for [[airplanes]] and one for [[helicopters]]. When the present terminal was put into use 28 January 1987, it was the first airport in Norway to have [[jet bridge]]s, nine in total. {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} The old terminal was demolished and made way for taxiway H The airport has two crossing runways: the main runway, north/south (18/36) and the main runway for helicopters, which is oriented northwest\u2013southeast (11/29).\n\nExpansion of the airplane terminal took place in 2009. The new gates were built without jetbridges. The airport's two largest airlines, SAS and Norwegian, showed little interest in such amenity and desired quicker turnaround times.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/bildegallerier/article963503.ece|title=Ingen gangbruer til flyene|last=Helgesen|first=Jan Petter|date=December 19, 2008|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001060119/http://www.aftenbladet.no/bildegallerier/article963503.ece|archive-date=October 1, 2009|df=}}</ref> SAS though later said that they did want jetbridges for their larger jet aircraft, and only wanted gates without jetbridges for their smaller turboprop aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/977597/Uakseptabelt_for_SAS.html|title=Uakseptabelt for SAS|last=Helgesen|first=Jan Petter|date=January 24, 2009|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205233026/http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/977597/Uakseptabelt_for_SAS.html|archive-date=February 5, 2009|df=}}</ref> The lack of jetbridges angered the societies representing the disabled and multiple sclerosis afflicted, and prompting several Rogaland politicians to put pressure on Avinor to reconsider the building.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/980883/Fylket_ber_Navarsete_legge_press_paa_Avinor.html|title=Fylket ber Navarsete legge press p\u00e5 Avinor|last=Tollaksen|first=Tor Gunnar|date=February 1, 2009|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916214648/http://aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/980883/Fylket_ber_Navarsete_legge_press_paa_Avinor.html|archive-date=September 16, 2009|df=}}</ref> In April 2009, Avinor decided not to build jetbridges.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://aftenbladet.no/lokalt/1011198/Rasende__paa_Avinor.html|title=Rasende p\u00e5 Avinor|last=Helgesen|first=Jan Petter|date=April 6, 2009|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407075421/http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/1011198/Rasende__paa_Avinor.html|archive-date=April 7, 2009|df=}}</ref>\n\nOffshore helicopter flights out of Stavanger commenced in 1966.

In 1952, Braathens SAFE received [[concession (contract)|concession]] to fly the routes [[Oslo]]\u2013Stavanger, Oslo\u2013[[Kristiansand]]\u2013Stavanger and the coastal route Stavanger\u2013[[Bergen]]\u2013[[\u00c5lesund]]\u2013[[Trondheim]]\u2013[[Bod\u00f8]]\u2013[[Troms\u00f8]]. [[Wider\u00f8e]] established itself at Sola in the late 1980s after they bought [[Sandefjord Airport, Torp]]-based [[Norsk Air]].  For a time, [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]] operated intercontinental nonstop flights between Stavanger and [[Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] (IAH) located in Texas in the U.S., with this service being operated by [[PrivatAir]] with [[Boeing 737-700]] jetliners configured with 44 business class seats.<ref>[http://airlineroute.net/2015/09/15/sk-iahewr-w15/ airlineroute.net - SAS Cancels Stavanger \u2013 Houston Route] 15 September 2015</ref>\n\nWhen the oil exploration in the Norwegian part of the [[North Sea]] started in 1967, there was a sudden need for helicopter transport out to the [[oil platforms]]. The first helicopter service was [[Helikopter Service]], later renamed CHC Helikopter Service, who started operations with 2 [[Sikorsky S-61]]Ns initially from a makeshift heliport at [[Stavanger Airport, Forus]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The offshore helicopter operations were moved to the Sola in 1989. [[Braathens Helikopter]], a sister company of Braathens SAFE, also operated helicopters from Sola in the period 1989\u20131994, but was then sold to Helikopter Service. [[Norsk Helikopter]], later renamed [[Bristow Norway]], started their offshore flying at Sola in 1993. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Bristow Norway is now the biggest helicopter company in Sola, with the average of 28 departures each day Monday\u2013Friday. {{Cn|date=March 2020}} CHC Helicopter Service has the average of 8 departures each day Monday\u2013Friday. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Foreign airlines===\n[[British Airways]] predecessors had started operating at Sola after [[World War II]], in 1980 they started regular flights with [[British Aircraft Corporation]][[BAC One-Eleven]] jet aircraft to [[London Heathrow Airport]]. Later, the route was operated with [[Boeing 737]]-200/-300/-400s. For a period the [[Boeing 737-400]] morning flight continued to [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle]] after [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] as an extension of the flight. British Airways later started operating [[Boeing 757-200]]s with [[Boeing 737-200]]s flying new services twice daily to [[London Gatwick Airport|London\u2013Gatwick]]. In 1994, British Airways employees at Sola were transferred to Braathens SAFE as part of new cooperation between the two airlines. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} However, in 1997, [[KLM]] bought 30% of Braathens (as the airline was renamed) and British Airways closed its Stavanger routes, because it lacked its own staff. {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Today British Airways operates 2 daily rotations\nutilising [[Airbus A319]] jet aircraft from [[London Heathrow Airport]] in competition with SAS Scandinavian Airlines (Also 2 rotations) to [[London Heathrow Airport]], Norwegian operates a daily rotation to London, Gatwick. [[Dan-Air]] flew the route London\u2013Gatwick \u2013 [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] \u2013 Stavanger, until they were taken over by British Airways in 1992. [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] has flown to Newcastle as well. [[Eastern Airways]] operating [[Embraer ERJ-145]] and [[ERJ-135]] regional jets and [[Wider\u00f8e]] using [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] Dash-8-402Q ([[Q400]]) propjets both fly to Newcastle, U.K.\n\nThe oil industry has also required scheduled routes between Stavanger and [[Scotland]], primarily to British oil center in [[Aberdeen]]. In addition to SAS, [[Air Anglia]] (later [[AirUK]], [[KLMuk]]) flew the route. Today, this route is flown by [[Scandinavian Airlines]], [[Wider\u00f8e]] and [[Eastern Airways]]. In the 1970s, [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]] started flights to Stavanger from [[Amsterdam]]. They have used the [[Douglas DC-9-10]], [[Boeing 737]], [[Fokker 100]], [[Fokker F27]] and [[Fokker 50]] aircraft, and this route was the first operated by KLM with [[Fokker 70]]s (their first Fokker 70 is named \"City of Stavanger\"). The route was operated by Braathens between 1997 and 2002. Today, this route is flown by the KLM five times daily by [[Boeing 737]], [[Fokker 70]] and [[Embraer ERJ-190]] aircraft, the latter two aircraft operated by [[KLM Cityhopper]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n[[Air France]] also operated to Stavanger, initially routing [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle]] - Stavanger - Gothenburg using [[Boeing 737]]s. The route later became a twice-daily direct Paris - Stavanger connection using [[Embraer ERJ-170]] jet aircraft, until it was discontinued in October 2015.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://airlineroute.net/2015/05/21/af-europe-w15/ |title=AIRFRANCE Ends 3 European Routes in W15 |publisher=Airline Route |accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Norwegian authorities have denied, among others, [[Northwest Airlines]] (since merged into [[Delta Air Lines]]) the right to start flying intercontinental flights from the [[United States]]. [[Lufthansa]] started in 2003 to fly twice daily to its [[airline hub|hub]] in [[Frankfurt]] in [[Germany]] with the [[Canadair Regional Jet|Canadair RJ-700]] aircraft, but ceased flying the route in October 2015.\n\nIn 2005, work to upgrade the terminal building started. A new domestic arrival hall was opened in the summer of 2005, followed by the refurbishing of the international arrival hall. A new international lounge finished in 2006 and a new baggage sorting system, and an extension of the check-in areas was completed in 2007. Avinor is working on the [[instrument landing system]] category II/LVTO approach system at the airport. This will allow planes to land with as little as 300 meters of horizontal visibility. {{Cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nOn 15 February 2010, Scandinavian Airlines announced that Wider\u00f8e would take over their regional routes connecting airports in Western Norway, including the route from Stavanger to Kristiansand. SAS will retire their five Fokker 50 aircraft by November 2010, and Wider\u00f8e will take over the operations and 75 employees, and serve the routes using Q300 and Q400 aircraft.<ref>{{cite news

The [[330 Squadron]] operated [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] [[search and rescue]] helicopters are the only squadron left at the airport, but still a number of military aircraft can be seen at the airport. [[NATO]]'s [[E-3 Sentry|AWACS]] aircraft, VIP transports, airlift command and fighter and attack aircraft are regular visitors. Technicians and equipment at the Sola AFB facilitate turnover and housing of fighters, predominately the RNoAF F-16A Fighting Falcons, as well as F-16s and other aircraft from NATO allies. Facilitating the Marines and Airforces training base, NATO FORSACS and NATO Joint Warfare Centre amongst others.\n\nThe Sola AFB is a NATO 24-hour readiness base for deployment of aircraft and military personnel in the event of a military escalated tension or conflict.\n\n==Technical facilities==\nSola has quite a number of technical facilities, and has the largest aviation technical environment in Norway, including the largest helicopter maintenance facilities in Northern Europe, Braathens had its technical main base at Sola, as does Norwegian Air Shuttle, CHC Helikopter Service, Heli-One Norway, Bristow Norway, Norsk Helikopterservice, [[Norcopter]], [[Pratt & Whitney]] Norway Engine Centre and the air force's helicopter main technical base. The former Braathens hangars now house SAS Technical Services, Norwegian Technical Services (which has their technical main base for their Boeing 737 fleet here) and Norsk Helikopterservice is to move into the former Braathens paint-hangar. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Heli-One (when part of Helikopter Service) had final assembly of most of the Bell 412 helicopters when introduced to the RNoAF. Both Bristow and Heli-One have their heavy duty maintenance facilities for their Sikorsky S-92A at the airport. Heli-One also specialises in the maintenance of the Turbomecca engines and the gearbox of the Super Puma. The airport also has the only Norwegian education school for aircraft mechanics, they are certified by Eurocopter qualifying them to make conversions of Eurocopter helicopters, they perform heavy duty maintenance tasks for many operators and air forces of foreign nations.\n\nOn 16 June 2006 the board of SAS decided to close the SAS owned Braathens Technical Services at Sola, which resulted in over 300 job losses. This was despite Beaathens Technical Services being the only profit making heavy maintenance center in the SAS Group and award winner in achievements, the SAS unions having the upper hand since SAS acquired Braathens. Braathens Technical Services undertook services for many customers including Boeing. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nOn 31 March 2012 the board of Pratt & Whitney also decided to close the Pratt & Whitney Norway Engine Center.<ref>http://www.aftenbladet.no/okonomi/195-ansatte-mister-jobben-450960b.html</ref> The last engine left the shop on 20 June 2012.

Although the orientation isn` t ideal for operating planes from both runways, they are both most commonly active at the same time, 18/36 for planes and 11/29 for helicopters operating from it, having to keep well within the bounds of their intersection allowing for helicopters to operate from 29 to taxiway H, and departure from 11 from taxiway H, utilising both directions for helicopters, hotel and to the outer edge. Runway 18\u201336 has a CAT II landing system, enabling landing in very poor visibility. 11/29 only has ILS from one direction, 29, 11 is less frequently used, among other considerations to reduce noise emissions and flying over built areas, catering for population living in central parts of Sola municipality.\n\n==Accidents==\n''See [[1961 Holtaheia Vickers Viking crash]].''\n\nOn 9 August 1961 [[Vickers VC.1 Viking]] 3B (registration: G-AHPM), operated by Cunard Eagle Airways (later [[British Eagle]]) crashed on into a mountain near [[Holta]] on approach to Stavanger Airport, Sola from [[London Heathrow]] airport with the deaths of all 39 on board: 3 crew, 34 schoolboys from [[The Archbishop Lanfranc School]] in [[Thornton Heath]], London, plus two members of staff from the school.

Foundation Press, NY: 2004, p. 663</ref> Louisiana's quarantine laws, Justice [[Edward Douglass White|Edward White]] said, were a reasonable exercise of the state's [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] that conflicted with neither the [[Dormant Commerce Clause]] nor the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

Before docking there, it had stopped at a state-run quarantine station further down the [[Mississippi River]], where all 408 passengers, most of whom were [[Italian American|Italian immigrants]], were certified as free from disease. At New Orleans, however, the ship was not allowed to land them there nor in any nearby [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parish]], as it was told that a ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' had been declared on land, forbidding the entry of any uninfected persons into the area.\n\nCompagnie Fran\u00e7aise de Navigation \u00e1 Vapeur (\"French Steam Navigation Company\", in English), the ''Britannia''{{'}}s French owner, filed for a [[restraining order]] in [[Courts of Louisiana#Orleans Parish District Courts|Orleans Parish District Court]] enjoining the state Board of Health from enforcing the quarantine, arguing that the real purpose of the quarantine was to prevent the immigrants from landing in New Orleans; after the court declined the ''Britannia'' took its passengers to [[Pensacola, Florida]], to be unloaded and then returned to New Orleans to deliver its cargo. The company's complaint against the state for damages was dismissed, a decision upheld by the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] on appeal.\n\nQuarantine laws had never been challenged, but ''[[dictum|dicta]]'' in the Court's opinions since ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' in 1824 had recognized them as a justifiable use of state power. Some earlier cases had challenged aspects of quarantine laws such as the taxes collected to fund them, but ''Compagnie Francaise'' challenged the application of quarantine law itself, under the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. It has been cited by later courts as holding involuntary quarantines constitutional, as recently as a [[Ebola virus cases in the United States|case arising from the 2014 African Ebola epidemic]].\n\n==Background==\n\nStarting in 1796, when it was under [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial administration]], [[History of New Orleans#Epidemics|New Orleans began suffering outbreaks]] of [[yellow fever]] every few years, and reported cases every summer. Death tolls began increasing, both from the disease and some then-common treatments for it (such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] injections), as the city's population grew following its return to [[Louisiana (New France)|French rule]] in 1800 and cession to the United States as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] three years later. The first American territorial governor, [[William C. C. Claiborne]], lost two wives and his daughter to the disease, which he himself also contracted but recovered from.<ref name=\"Country Roads article\">{{cite magazine|last=Hall|first=Christie Matherne|title=The Saffron Scourge in New Orleans|url=https://countryroadsmagazine.com/art-and-culture/history/yellow-fever/|magazine=Country Roads|date=March 23, 2018|accessdate=February 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMany other migrants from elsewhere in the U.S. followed; they proved more susceptible to yellow fever than longtime residents. An 1817 outbreak killed 800 in New Orleans alone, prompting [[Louisiana State Legislature|the state legislature]] to create a New Orleans Board of Health, the first government [[public health]] agency in the U.S., only to dissolve it two years later as ineffectual after an outbreak that year claimed 2,000 lives. These deaths were often exacerbated by local newspapers' refusal to report on the disease, as businesses feared the economic effects of a public panic.<ref name=\"Country Roads article\" />\n\nAfter [[History of yellow fever#New Orleans, Louisiana: 1853|an 1853 outbreak]] left almost 8,000{{efn|Some later estimates put the true death toll closer to 12,000.<ref name=\"Country Roads article\" />}} residents of New Orleans dead, the state again created a Board of Health and made it permanent. The [[Union Navy]]'s [[Union blockade|blockade]] of New Orleans six years later, as the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began, the city for the first time in the century recorded no deaths from yellow fever. When General [[Benjamin Butler]] took over control of the city when it fell to [[Union Army|Union forces]] in 1862, [[Benjamin Butler#Public health management|he went further]], dispatching 2,000 troops to dispose of the city's garbage and instituting a quarantine requirement for arriving ships. At a point {{convert|70|mi}} down the [[Mississippi River]] from the city, all vessels were stopped by gunboats and held for 40 days while they were monitored for disease. There were few deaths from yellow fever in New Orleans for the remainder of the war.<ref name=\"Country Roads article\" />\n[[File:Yellow Fever Deaths Lafayette Cemetery 1 New Orleans.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone for family killed by 1878 yellow fever outbreak in New Orleans]]\nYellow fever epidemics in the city resumed after the war, when an 1867 outbreak killed 3,000. During this one the Board of Health was active, putting quarantine flags on houses with known cases and [[fumigation|fumigating]] spaces. [[History of yellow fever#Lower Mississippi Valley: 1878|The 1878 outbreak]], which afflicted cities in the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain|Lower Mississippi Valley]] as far north as [[Memphis, Tennessee]], led the newspapers to abandon their past practice of downplaying outbreaks to avoid public panics since, they realized, it had actually made the epidemics worse.<ref name=\"Country Roads article\" />\n\nBusinesses, particularly shipping companies, still chafed at the quarantine laws. In 1882 the Louisiana legislature amended the statutes to require that vessels stopping at the quarantine station pay as much as $30 (${{inflation|US|30|1882|r=-2}} in today's dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in fees, depending on their size, with the proceeds going to fund the board's operations and infrastructure. One New Orleans-based shipper challenged this in court as a [[tonnage tax]], which they called an unconstitutional violation of the [[Commerce Clause]] since the federal government alone had authority to levy one; they further alleged that it was being used for the city of New Orleans' general revenue rather than its stated purpose.<ref name=\"Morgan's Steamship Company\">{{cite court|litigants=[[Morgan's Steamship Co. v.

The ''Britannia''{{'s}} crew were reportedly additionally told that if they landed anywhere outside of the quarantined area with the intention of offloading their passengers, those areas would be added to the quarantine.<ref name=\"SCOTUS 382\"/>\n \nThe company's agents in New Orleans filed a petition in Orleans Parish [[Louisiana District Courts|District Court]] for a [[restraining order]] enjoining the state from enforcing the quarantine against the ''Britannia''{{'}}s passengers, and a judgement of $2,500 against the board and its members ''[[in solido]]''. They argued the state's real objective had been to prevent it from landing Italian immigrants,<ref name=\"LASC decision\" /> noting that the board had taken no measures to prevent the entry into New Orleans of Italian immigrants who had disembarked at New York and taken the train to Louisiana, and had allowed other large groups to enter the city later.<ref name=\"SCOTUS 382\"/> After the court dismissed the petition for failure to show cause, the ''Britannia'' took its passengers to [[Pensacola, Florida]], to put off and returned to New Orleans, where it unloaded its cargo. The company refiled its action as a damage claim, increasing its requested judgement to $11,000 and naming the individual board members as defendants.<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, at 383</ref>\n\nIn this filing the company alleged that Act 192 of the Laws of 1898, authorizing the ''cordon sanitaire'', violated a provision of the [[Louisiana State Constitution#Louisiana Constitution of 1898|recently adopted state constitution]] requiring that laws have one goal clearly specified by a title,<ref>{{cite web|title=Article 31: Laws to Embrace One Object, Expressed In Its Title|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433034029912&view=1up&seq=47#|publisher=[[HathiTrust]]|accessdate=February 26, 2020}}</ref> and in this case the title limited the act to applying to travel within the state, not vessels arriving from outside the state or country. Its application to an international arrival, they argued, also violated the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], since only Congress could regulate foreign commerce, and was also banned by treaties with France and Italy, from whence the ''Britannia'' had come. Lastly, the company argued, the order barring the landing of the passengers was a denial of its [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] and [[Due Process Clause|due process]] rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' I, at 646</ref>\n\nAgain, the district court dismissed the case after the board of health made a [[peremptory plea]] arguing [[cause of action|no cause of action]] existed for Compagnie Francaise.

Nicholls]], a former governor of the state, wrote for a unanimous court affirming the district court.<ref name=\"LASC decision\" />\n\nNicholls started with the state constitutional claim, and the presumption that the legislature intended Act 192 to be in accordance with the state constitution. He found its title had several clauses which could justify the power to declare and establish a ''cordon sanitaire'', and reiterated another recent holding of the court that the titles of bills need only state the general purpose of the act rather than the enumerated specifics.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Allopathic State Board v. Fowler|vol=50|reporter=La. Ann.|opinion=1358|court=[[Louisiana Supreme Court|La.]]|date=1898}}</ref> The language of the act was broad enough to allow the board to impose the measure, as well, even if it did not specifically mention it. \"[It] does not limit the board to prohibiting the introduction of persons from one portion of the state to ... an infected portion\" Nicholls wrote, \"but evidently looks as well to the prohibition of the introduction of persons from outside the state into any infected portion of the state\"; it would defeat the purpose of the quarantine were it held to bar entry into an afflicted area only to those attempting to enter it from elsewhere in the state, he suggested.<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' I, 656\u2013658</ref>\n\nThe company had also argued that Act 192 did not give the board any powers beyond those previous legislation had granted it. Nicholls dismissed this contention as in direct contradiction to the stated purpose and language of the act, noting also that the legislature had had a good reason. During the 1897 outbreak, Italian emigrants had continued to arrive in New Orleans by boat, but despite \"excited public discussions\", the board had concluded it lacked the power to prevent their entry at the time. In September 1898, the board had also been considering the possibility of increased travel to the United States through New Orleans from the Caribbean in the aftermath of the [[Spanish-American War]].<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' I, 659\u2013660</ref>\n\nLastly Nicholls considered the [[Federal question jurisdiction|federal questions]] the company had raised. He found them as baseless as their arguments about the language of Act 192. A decade earlier, he wrote, the U.S. Supreme Court had rejected a claim that the Fourteenth Amendment changed in any way the states' police power to protect public health and safety, from what the Court had recognized in 1824's ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]''.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=[[Gibbons v.

[and] is not interfered with by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' I, 660\u2013661</ref>\n\nNicholls found Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise's due process arguments \"utterly untenable\" as the board's action was necessary under the law; he wondered rhetorically what else it could have done. The passengers had been inconvenienced, he agreed, and the company forced to incur extra expenses, but that was ''[[damnum absque injuria]]'', meaning it could not recover from the state. Nicholls did not give much credence to the company's claim it had been specifically targeted, either, since it had merely been the first ship so excluded and \"there is no reason to suspect that [the order] would not have been executed against any other ship or ships which might fall under its terms.\"<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' I, 663\u2013664</ref>\n\n==Supreme Court==\n\nCompagnie Fran\u00e7aise filed a ''[[certiorari]]'' petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case on appeal. It was granted and the Court heard oral arguments in October 1900. At the end of the Court's following term, 20 months later, it handed down its decision affirming the Louisiana Supreme Court. While all nine justices agreed that quarantines were an acceptable use of the police power, they differed on whether Louisiana's exercise of it in this instance had been a permissible use of it. Justice [[Edward Douglass White]], a Louisiana native who would later serve as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]], wrote for himself and six colleagues in the [[majority opinion|majority]], while Justice [[Henry Billings Brown]]'s [[dissenting opinion|dissent]] was joined by [[John Marshall Harlan]].<ref name=\"Main SCOTUS cite\" />\n\n===Majority opinion===\n[[File:Edward White, head-and-shoulders portrait, facing slightly left, 1905.jpg|thumb|right|Justice White in 1905, three years after ''Compagnie Francaise'']]\nAfter reiterating the facts of the case and the Louisiana Supreme Court's holdings, Justice White reduced the company's case to four arguments that were before the U.S. Supreme Court. He decided to treat the first two, the alleged Commerce Clause and Fourteenth Amendment violations, singly since they both involved the U.S. Constitution. The first, White argued, had been dealt with at length in ''Morgan's Steamship Company'', the 1886 case, from which he quoted extensively, holding that the states were free to enact and enforce quarantine laws unless Congress decided to [[federal preemption|preempt]] them, a holding the Court had reaffirmed in 1900.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=[[Louisiana v.

At the same time, Congress could by affirmative action displace the local laws, substitute laws of its own, and thus correct any unjustifiable and oppressive exercise of power by state legislation.}}</ref><ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, 387\u2013390</ref>\n\nCompagnie Fran\u00e7aise had offered \"a most copious reference\" to cases where the Court had held states to have overreached into Congress's domain in their regulations of commerce, White observed. Rather than review them all exhaustively, White wrote, it was enough to say they were \"inapposite\". The petitioners' primary error was in using as examples laws that excluded from a state objects which might carry disease, such as \"criminals, diseased persons and things, and paupers\", were not regulating \"legitimate\" commerce and were thus constitutional. That was true in some of those cases, but, White countered, \"this implies no limitation on the power to regulate by health laws the subjects of legitimate commerce.\"<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, 390\u2013391</ref>\n\nSince Act 192 had been constitutional, White continued, it could also not have acted to violate the company's due process rights. \"[T]he contention demonstrates its own unsoundness\", he wrote, since it amounted to a theory that either the Fourteenth Amendment had eliminated the police power, or had rendered it unusable. \"In other words,\" he characterized this argument, \"that the lawful powers of government which the Constitution has conferred may not be exerted without bringing about a violation of the Constitution.\"<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, at 393</ref>\n\nLikewise, the treaties Louisiana had allegedly violated \"were not intended to, and did not, deprive the government of the United States of those powers necessarily inhering in it and essential to the health and safety of its people\" since they would have deprived the federal government, as much as the states, of taking those actions, White wrote. Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise had in particular pointed to a treaty concluded with Greece, that had provided in part that Greek vessels coming to the U.S. would carry a certificate from authorities at the point of departure that its passengers and cargo were disease-free. But, White noted, the same section of the treaty allowed for local authorities to quarantine the ship on arrival, either as part of a general measure or if it specifically was found to have sick passengers. The documentation from Greece could not in any be expected to exempt them since authorities there could not make any determinations about the health of the passengers at the port of arrival.<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, 394\u2013395</ref>\n\nThe last of the company's four arguments was that Act 192 was superseded by [[History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States|federal immigration law]], specifically an 1893 act of Congress expanding the quarantine powers of the [[Marine Hospital Service]]. \"So far as the act of 1893 is concerned,\" White responded, \"it is manifest that it did not contemplate the overthrow of the existing state quarantine systems and the abrogation of the powers on the subject of health and quarantine exercised by the states\".<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, 395\u2013396</ref> He declined to go into detail, but included a footnote reprinting a section of the act that directs the service's supervising surgeon general to \"cooperate with and aid state and municipal boards of health in the execution and enforcement of the rules and regulations of such boards\".<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, at 396n2</ref>\n\n===Dissenting opinion===\n[[File:Henry Billings Brown 2.jpg|thumb|right|Justice Brown, in 1899]]\nWhile he agreed that the power of states to impose quarantines is \"so well settled by repeated decisions of this Court as to be no longer open to doubt\", Justice Brown did not think the ''cordon sanitaire'' declared by the board was \"not a necessary or proper exercise of the police power\". Preventing the entry of healthy individuals into quarantined areas did not seem to him to serve to curtail a disease's spread, but rather to reduce the likelihood that they would become infected in the quarantine area. \"This is a danger not to the population, but to the immigrants\", Brown wrote. \"It seems to me that this is a possibility too remote to justify the drastic measure of a total exclusion of all classes of immigrants.\"<ref name=\"Brown dissent 397\u2013399\">''Compagnie Francaise'' II, 397\u2013399, [[Henry Billings Brown|Brown]], J., dissenting</ref>\n\nThe Court should have looked not to ''Morgan's'' as a [[precedent (law)|precedent]], Brown argued, but instead to an earlier case, ''[[Railroad Company v.

The same section of the treaty with Greece that the majority had relied on in dismissing the petitioners' argument also had a provision he quoted, stating that ships with the required documentation from health officers at the port of embarkation were free from disease \"shall be subjected to no other quarantine than such as may be necessary for the visit of the health officer of the port where such vessels shall have arrived, after which said vessels shall be allowed immediately to enter and unload their cargoes.\" If the ''cordon sanitaire'' did not violate that provision, Brown concluded, \"I am unable to conceive a state of facts which would\" since the Constitution did not grant states the power to pass laws that conflicted with foreign treaties.<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, 400\u2013401</ref>\n\n==Subsequent jurisprudence and commentary==\n\nNo courts have revisited, reconsidered or modified ''Compagnie Francaise'' since it was handed down.

Louisiana Board of Health''''', 186 [[United States Reports|U.S.]] 380 (1902), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case which held [[constitutional]] state laws requiring the involuntary [[quarantine]] of individuals to prevent the spread of disease.<ref>Bonnie, R.J. et al., ''Criminal Law, Second Edition.'' Foundation Press, NY: 2004, p. 663</ref> Louisiana's quarantine laws, Justice [[Edward Douglass White|Edward White]] said, were a reasonable exercise of the state's [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] that conflicted with neither the [[Dormant Commerce Clause]] nor the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. In [[dissenting opinion|dissent]], Justice [[Henry Billings Brown]], joined by [[John Marshall Harlan]], agreed that while quarantine laws were constitutional, Louisiana's went beyond the scope of the state's authority over [[interstate commerce]], even violating several treaties between the United States and other nations.\n\nThe case had arisen in 1898, when the S.S. ''Britannia'' sailed from [[Palermo]] to [[Marseille]], then across the Atlantic for [[New Orleans]]. Before docking there, it had stopped at a state-run quarantine station further down the [[Mississippi River]], where all 408 passengers, most of whom were [[Italian American|Italian immigrants]], were certified as free from disease. At New Orleans, however, the ship was not allowed to land them there nor in any nearby [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parish]], as it was told that a ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' had been declared on land, forbidding the entry of any uninfected persons into the area.\n\nCompagnie Fran\u00e7aise de Navigation \u00e1 Vapeur (\"French Steam Navigation Company\", in English), the ''Britannia''{{'}}s French owner, filed for a [[restraining order]] in [[Courts of Louisiana#Orleans Parish District Courts|Orleans Parish District Court]] enjoining the state Board of Health from enforcing the quarantine, arguing that the real purpose of the quarantine was to prevent the immigrants from landing in New Orleans; after the court declined the ''Britannia'' took its passengers to [[Pensacola, Florida]], to be unloaded and then returned to New Orleans to deliver its cargo. The company's complaint against the state for damages was dismissed, a decision upheld by the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] on appeal.\n\nQuarantine laws had never been challenged, but ''[[dictum|dicta]]'' in the Court's opinions since ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' in 1824 had recognized them as a justifiable use of state power. Some earlier cases had challenged aspects of quarantine laws such as the taxes collected to fund them, but ''Compagnie Francaise'' challenged the application of quarantine law itself, under the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. It has been cited by later courts as holding involuntary quarantines constitutional, as recently as a [[Ebola virus cases in the United States|case arising from the 2014 African Ebola epidemic]].\n\n==Background==\n\nStarting in 1796, when it was under [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial administration]], [[History of New Orleans#Epidemics|New Orleans began suffering outbreaks]] of [[yellow fever]] every few years, and reported cases every summer. Death tolls began increasing, both from the disease and some then-common treatments for it (such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] injections), as the city's population grew following its return to [[Louisiana (New France)|French rule]] in 1800 and cession to the United States as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] three years later. The first American territorial governor, [[William C. C. Claiborne]], lost two wives and his daughter to the disease, which he himself also contracted but recovered from.<ref name=\"Country Roads article\">{{cite magazine|last=Hall|first=Christie Matherne|title=The Saffron Scourge in New Orleans|url=https://countryroadsmagazine.com/art-and-culture/history/yellow-fever/|magazine=Country Roads|date=March 23, 2018|accessdate=February 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMany other migrants from elsewhere in the U.S. followed; they proved more susceptible to yellow fever than longtime residents. An 1817 outbreak killed 800 in New Orleans alone, prompting [[Louisiana State Legislature|the state legislature]] to create a New Orleans Board of Health, the first government [[public health]] agency in the U.S., only to dissolve it two years later as ineffectual after an outbreak that year claimed 2,000 lives. These deaths were often exacerbated by local newspapers' refusal to report on the disease, as businesses feared the economic effects of a public panic.<ref name=\"Country Roads article\" />\n\nAfter [[History of yellow fever#New Orleans, Louisiana: 1853|an 1853 outbreak]] left almost 8,000{{efn|Some later estimates put the true death toll closer to 12,000.<ref name=\"Country Roads article\" />}} residents of New Orleans dead, the state again created a Board of Health and made it permanent. The [[Union Navy]]'s [[Union blockade|blockade]] of New Orleans six years later, as the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began, the city for the first time in the century recorded no deaths from yellow fever. When General [[Benjamin Butler]] took over control of the city when it fell to [[Union Army|Union forces]] in 1862, [[Benjamin Butler#Public health management|he went further]], dispatching 2,000 troops to dispose of the city's garbage and instituting a quarantine requirement for arriving ships. At a point {{convert|70|mi}} down the [[Mississippi River]] from the city, all vessels were stopped by gunboats and held for 40 days while they were monitored for disease. There were few deaths from yellow fever in New Orleans for the remainder of the war.<ref name=\"Country Roads article\" />\n[[File:Yellow Fever Deaths Lafayette Cemetery 1 New Orleans.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone for family killed by 1878 yellow fever outbreak in New Orleans]]\nYellow fever epidemics in the city resumed after the war, when an 1867 outbreak killed 3,000. During this one the Board of Health was active, putting quarantine flags on houses with known cases and [[fumigation|fumigating]] spaces. [[History of yellow fever#Lower Mississippi Valley: 1878|The 1878 outbreak]], which afflicted cities in the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain|Lower Mississippi Valley]] as far north as [[Memphis, Tennessee]], led the newspapers to abandon their past practice of downplaying outbreaks to avoid public panics since, they realized, it had actually made the epidemics worse.<ref name=\"Country Roads article\" />\n\nBusinesses, particularly shipping companies, still chafed at the quarantine laws. In 1882 the Louisiana legislature amended the statutes to require that vessels stopping at the quarantine station pay as much as $30 (${{inflation|US|30|1882|r=-2}} in today's dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in fees, depending on their size, with the proceeds going to fund the board's operations and infrastructure. One New Orleans-based shipper challenged this in court as a [[tonnage tax]], which they called an unconstitutional violation of the [[Commerce Clause]] since the federal government alone had authority to levy one; they further alleged that it was being used for the city of New Orleans' general revenue rather than its stated purpose.<ref name=\"Morgan's Steamship Company\">{{cite court|litigants=[[Morgan's Steamship Co. v.

Unanimously, the nine justices [[holding (law)|held]] that the fee was not a tax and even if it were one, would still have been constitutional as while the federal government had the authority to require and enforce quarantines, it was only exclusive to it [[Federal preemption|if it actually did so]]. As it had historically left that to the states, Louisiana could act as it saw fit within the Constitution to exercise its [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] and protect public health.<ref name=\"Morgan's Steamship Company\" />\n\n\"If there is a city in the United States which has need of quarantine laws, it is New Orleans\", Justice [[Samuel Freeman Miller]], a physician prior to his legal career,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ulm |first1=Aaron Hardy |title=Samuel Freeman Miller, M.D |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |date=August 15, 1957 |volume=257 |pages=327\u2013329 |doi=10.1056/NEJM195708152570709 |url=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM195708152570709}}</ref> wrote for the Court.

After stopping in [[Marseille]] to pick up more passengers and cargo, it sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and up the [[Mississippi River]].

Hereafter ''Compagnie Francaise II''</ref> under a ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' forbidding the entry of any uninfected persons, a measure the state legislature had authorized the board to take earlier that year. The ''Britannia''{{'s}} crew were reportedly additionally told that if they landed anywhere outside of the quarantined area with the intention of offloading their passengers, those areas would be added to the quarantine.<ref name=\"SCOTUS 382\"/>\n \nThe company's agents in New Orleans filed a petition in Orleans Parish [[Louisiana District Courts|District Court]] for a [[restraining order]] enjoining the state from enforcing the quarantine against the ''Britannia''{{'}}s passengers, and a judgement of $2,500 against the board and its members ''[[in solido]]''. They argued the state's real objective had been to prevent it from landing Italian immigrants,<ref name=\"LASC decision\" /> noting that the board had taken no measures to prevent the entry into New Orleans of Italian immigrants who had disembarked at New York and taken the train to Louisiana, and had allowed other large groups to enter the city later.<ref name=\"SCOTUS 382\"/> After the court dismissed the petition for failure to show cause, the ''Britannia'' took its passengers to [[Pensacola, Florida]], to put off and returned to New Orleans, where it unloaded its cargo. The company refiled its action as a damage claim, increasing its requested judgement to $11,000 and naming the individual board members as defendants.<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, at 383</ref>\n\nIn this filing the company alleged that Act 192 of the Laws of 1898, authorizing the ''cordon sanitaire'', violated a provision of the [[Louisiana State Constitution#Louisiana Constitution of 1898|recently adopted state constitution]] requiring that laws have one goal clearly specified by a title,<ref>{{cite web|title=Article 31: Laws to Embrace One Object, Expressed In Its Title|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433034029912&view=1up&seq=47#|publisher=[[HathiTrust]]|accessdate=February 26, 2020}}</ref> and in this case the title limited the act to applying to travel within the state, not vessels arriving from outside the state or country. Its application to an international arrival, they argued, also violated the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], since only Congress could regulate foreign commerce, and was also banned by treaties with France and Italy, from whence the ''Britannia'' had come. Lastly, the company argued, the order barring the landing of the passengers was a denial of its [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] and [[Due Process Clause|due process]] rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' I, at 646</ref>\n\nAgain, the district court dismissed the case after the board of health made a [[peremptory plea]] arguing [[cause of action|no cause of action]] existed for Compagnie Francaise. The company appealed the decision to the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"LASC decision\" />\n\n==Louisiana Supreme Court==\n[[File:Francis T. Nicholls.jpg|right|thumb|Francis T. Nicholls]]\nIn March 1899 the state's Supreme Court reached its decision in the case. Chief Justice [[Francis T. Nicholls]], a former governor of the state, wrote for a unanimous court affirming the district court.<ref name=\"LASC decision\" />\n\nNicholls started with the state constitutional claim, and the presumption that the legislature intended Act 192 to be in accordance with the state constitution. He found its title had several clauses which could justify the power to declare and establish a ''cordon sanitaire'', and reiterated another recent holding of the court that the titles of bills need only state the general purpose of the act rather than the enumerated specifics.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Allopathic State Board v. Fowler|vol=50|reporter=La. Ann.|opinion=1358|court=[[Louisiana Supreme Court|La.]]|date=1898}}</ref> The language of the act was broad enough to allow the board to impose the measure, as well, even if it did not specifically mention it. \"[It] does not limit the board to prohibiting the introduction of persons from one portion of the state to ... an infected portion\" Nicholls wrote, \"but evidently looks as well to the prohibition of the introduction of persons from outside the state into any infected portion of the state\"; it would defeat the purpose of the quarantine were it held to bar entry into an afflicted area only to those attempting to enter it from elsewhere in the state, he suggested.<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' I, 656\u2013658</ref>\n\nThe company had also argued that Act 192 did not give the board any powers beyond those previous legislation had granted it. Nicholls dismissed this contention as in direct contradiction to the stated purpose and language of the act, noting also that the legislature had had a good reason. During the 1897 outbreak, Italian emigrants had continued to arrive in New Orleans by boat, but despite \"excited public discussions\", the board had concluded it lacked the power to prevent their entry at the time. In September 1898, the board had also been considering the possibility of increased travel to the United States through New Orleans from the Caribbean in the aftermath of the [[Spanish-American War]].<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' I, 659\u2013660</ref>\n\nLastly Nicholls considered the [[Federal question jurisdiction|federal questions]] the company had raised. He found them as baseless as their arguments about the language of Act 192. A decade earlier, he wrote, the U.S. Supreme Court had rejected a claim that the Fourteenth Amendment changed in any way the states' police power to protect public health and safety, from what the Court had recognized in 1824's ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]''.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=[[Gibbons v.

[and] is not interfered with by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' I, 660\u2013661</ref>\n\nNicholls found Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise's due process arguments \"utterly untenable\" as the board's action was necessary under the law; he wondered rhetorically what else it could have done. The passengers had been inconvenienced, he agreed, and the company forced to incur extra expenses, but that was ''[[damnum absque injuria]]'', meaning it could not recover from the state. Nicholls did not give much credence to the company's claim it had been specifically targeted, either, since it had merely been the first ship so excluded and \"there is no reason to suspect that [the order] would not have been executed against any other ship or ships which might fall under its terms.\"<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' I, 663\u2013664</ref>\n\n==Supreme Court==\n\nCompagnie Fran\u00e7aise filed a ''[[certiorari]]'' petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case on appeal. It was granted and the Court heard oral arguments in October 1900. At the end of the Court's following term, 20 months later, it handed down its decision affirming the Louisiana Supreme Court. While all nine justices agreed that quarantines were an acceptable use of the police power, they differed on whether Louisiana's exercise of it in this instance had been a permissible use of it. Justice [[Edward Douglass White]], a Louisiana native who would later serve as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]], wrote for himself and six colleagues in the [[majority opinion|majority]], while Justice [[Henry Billings Brown]]'s [[dissenting opinion|dissent]] was joined by [[John Marshall Harlan]].<ref name=\"Main SCOTUS cite\" />\n\n===Majority opinion===\n[[File:Edward White, head-and-shoulders portrait, facing slightly left, 1905.jpg|thumb|right|Justice White in 1905, three years after ''Compagnie Francaise'']]\nAfter reiterating the facts of the case and the Louisiana Supreme Court's holdings, Justice White reduced the company's case to four arguments that were before the U.S. Supreme Court.

The first, White argued, had been dealt with at length in ''Morgan's Steamship Company'', the 1886 case, from which he quoted extensively, holding that the states were free to enact and enforce quarantine laws unless Congress decided to [[federal preemption|preempt]] them, a holding the Court had reaffirmed in 1900.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=[[Louisiana v. Texas]]|vol=176|reporter=[[United States Reports|U.S.]]|opinion=1|pinpoint=21\u201322|year=1900|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/176/1/|accessdate=February 28, 2000|quote=[E]ven if Congress had remained silent on the subject, it would not have followed that the exercise of the police power of the state in this regard, although necessarily operating on interstate commerce, would be therefore invalid. Although, from the nature and subjects of the power of regulating commerce, it must be ordinarily exercised by the national government exclusively, this has not been held to be so where in relation to the particular subject matter different rules might be suitable in different localities. At the same time, Congress could by affirmative action displace the local laws, substitute laws of its own, and thus correct any unjustifiable and oppressive exercise of power by state legislation.}}</ref><ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, 387\u2013390</ref>\n\nCompagnie Fran\u00e7aise had offered \"a most copious reference\" to cases where the Court had held states to have overreached into Congress's domain in their regulations of commerce, White observed. Rather than review them all exhaustively, White wrote, it was enough to say they were \"inapposite\". The petitioners' primary error was in using as examples laws that excluded from a state objects which might carry disease, such as \"criminals, diseased persons and things, and paupers\", were not regulating \"legitimate\" commerce and were thus constitutional. That was true in some of those cases, but, White countered, \"this implies no limitation on the power to regulate by health laws the subjects of legitimate commerce.\"<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, 390\u2013391</ref>\n\nSince Act 192 had been constitutional, White continued, it could also not have acted to violate the company's due process rights. \"[T]he contention demonstrates its own unsoundness\", he wrote, since it amounted to a theory that either the Fourteenth Amendment had eliminated the police power, or had rendered it unusable. \"In other words,\" he characterized this argument, \"that the lawful powers of government which the Constitution has conferred may not be exerted without bringing about a violation of the Constitution.\"<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, at 393</ref>\n\nLikewise, the treaties Louisiana had allegedly violated \"were not intended to, and did not, deprive the government of the United States of those powers necessarily inhering in it and essential to the health and safety of its people\" since they would have deprived the federal government, as much as the states, of taking those actions, White wrote. Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise had in particular pointed to a treaty concluded with Greece, that had provided in part that Greek vessels coming to the U.S. would carry a certificate from authorities at the point of departure that its passengers and cargo were disease-free. But, White noted, the same section of the treaty allowed for local authorities to quarantine the ship on arrival, either as part of a general measure or if it specifically was found to have sick passengers. The documentation from Greece could not in any be expected to exempt them since authorities there could not make any determinations about the health of the passengers at the port of arrival.<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, 394\u2013395</ref>\n\nThe last of the company's four arguments was that Act 192 was superseded by [[History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States|federal immigration law]], specifically an 1893 act of Congress expanding the quarantine powers of the [[Marine Hospital Service]]. \"So far as the act of 1893 is concerned,\" White responded, \"it is manifest that it did not contemplate the overthrow of the existing state quarantine systems and the abrogation of the powers on the subject of health and quarantine exercised by the states\".<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, 395\u2013396</ref> He declined to go into detail, but included a footnote reprinting a section of the act that directs the service's supervising surgeon general to \"cooperate with and aid state and municipal boards of health in the execution and enforcement of the rules and regulations of such boards\".<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, at 396n2</ref>\n\n===Dissenting opinion===\n[[File:Henry Billings Brown 2.jpg|thumb|right|Justice Brown, in 1899]]\nWhile he agreed that the power of states to impose quarantines is \"so well settled by repeated decisions of this Court as to be no longer open to doubt\", Justice Brown did not think the ''cordon sanitaire'' declared by the board was \"not a necessary or proper exercise of the police power\". Preventing the entry of healthy individuals into quarantined areas did not seem to him to serve to curtail a disease's spread, but rather to reduce the likelihood that they would become infected in the quarantine area. \"This is a danger not to the population, but to the immigrants\", Brown wrote. \"It seems to me that this is a possibility too remote to justify the drastic measure of a total exclusion of all classes of immigrants.\"<ref name=\"Brown dissent 397\u2013399\">''Compagnie Francaise'' II, 397\u2013399, [[Henry Billings Brown|Brown]], J., dissenting</ref>\n\nThe Court should have looked not to ''Morgan's'' as a [[precedent (law)|precedent]], Brown argued, but instead to an earlier case, ''[[Railroad Company v. Husen]]'', which the majority was \"directly in the teeth of\".<ref name=\"Brown dissent 397\u2013399\" /> In that 1877 case, the Court unanimously struck down a [[Missouri]] law forbidding the transport into the state of any cattle from [[Texas]], [[Mexico]] or an [[Indian reservation]]{{efn|Cattle from those jurisdictions ''could'' be transported ''through'' the state on steamboats or railcar<ref name=\"Railroad Co. v.

The same section of the treaty with Greece that the majority had relied on in dismissing the petitioners' argument also had a provision he quoted, stating that ships with the required documentation from health officers at the port of embarkation were free from disease \"shall be subjected to no other quarantine than such as may be necessary for the visit of the health officer of the port where such vessels shall have arrived, after which said vessels shall be allowed immediately to enter and unload their cargoes.\" If the ''cordon sanitaire'' did not violate that provision, Brown concluded, \"I am unable to conceive a state of facts which would\" since the Constitution did not grant states the power to pass laws that conflicted with foreign treaties.<ref>''Compagnie Francaise'' II, 400\u2013401</ref>\n\n==Subsequent jurisprudence and commentary==\n\nNo courts have revisited, reconsidered or modified ''Compagnie Francaise'' since it was handed down. It is cited in later opinions and commentary as holding constitutional the power to quarantine. The Supreme Court referred to it as such, quoting it at length, in 1913's ''[[Minnesota Rate Cases]]''<ref>{{cite court|litigants=[[Minnesota Rate Cases]]|vol=230|reporter=[[United States Reports|U.S.]]|opinion=352|pinpoint=407|date=1913|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10622996222572502972#p407|accessdate=February 29, 2020}}</ref> It has also been cited that way in a ''[[Minnesota Law Review]]'' article.<ref name=\"Law review paper\" /> In 2016 [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey|New Jersey]] federal district judge [[Kevin McNulty (judge)|Kevin McNulty]] cited ''Compagnie Francaise'', among other cases, in holding that existing [[case law]] on quarantines was sufficient to sustain state officials' defense of [[qualified immunity]] in a suit against them brought by [[Kaci Hickox]], a nurse quarantined for 80 hours after she showed a fever upon her return to [[Newark International Airport]] from [[Sierra Leone]], where she had been treating victims of the [[Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra Leone|2014 Ebola outbreak]]. \"I do not find that prior quarantine case law establishes any unconstitutionality\" in how she was dealt with, McNulty wrote.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Hickox v.
