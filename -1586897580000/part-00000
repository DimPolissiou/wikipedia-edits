After years as a prolific graffiter, Kal\u00e1b entered the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Prague]], where he earned a Master\u00b4s degree in 2006. Attracted by the concepts of abstract [[Neoplasticism]], his work evolved from the making of straight-lined sculptures and 3D alphabetic letter designs to the making of the painted canvas-objects of organic shapes which became characteristic in his recent work. The artist has declared: \"after a while, I simplified the elements to squares and circles, and then stepped away from squares and just depicted circles\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Meeting Jan Kal\u00e1b |url=https://blog.artsper.com/en/get-inspired/meeting-jan-kalab/ |website=blog.artsper.com |accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref> In the view of Rachel Frisby (curator of Albin Polasek Museum), Kal\u00e1b\u00b4s artistic career ''mirrors the country of Czechoslovakia and, through its independence, its new shape and cultural direction''.<ref name=\":1\" /> An extensive account of Kal\u00e1b\u00b4s career and work is available in print.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|url=https://www.bookdepository.com/es/Point-Space-Jan-Kal%C3%A1b/9788090681194|title=Jan Kal\u00e1b : point of space|isbn=9788090681194}}</ref> Many written and video interviews with the artist are available in various media.\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n[[File:Mural Art Strasnicka Jan Kalab 02.JPG|thumb|upright=1.6|Mural art by Jan Kal\u00e1b, Prague Municipal House]]\nKal\u00e1b had his first solo exhibition at the Trafo Gallery in Prague in 2008.
