Many of his finest works were created in the decade or so after 1906, when he developed a rigorous style that emphasized flattened forms and decorative pattern. In 1917, he relocated to a suburb of [[Nice]] on the [[French Riviera]], and the more relaxed style of his work during the 1920s gained him critical acclaim as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting.<ref>Wattenmaker, Richard J.; [[Distel, Anne]], et al.

When ill health in his final years prevented him from painting, he created an important body of work in the medium of cut paper collage.\n\nHis mastery of the expressive language of colour and drawing, displayed in a body of work spanning over a half-century, won him recognition as a leading figure in [[modern art]].<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mati/hd_mati.htm Magdalena Dabrowski Department of Nineteenth-Century, Modern, and Contemporary Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art Source: Henri Matisse (1869\u20131954) | Thematic Essay | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art] Retrieved 30 June 2010.</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Henri + Am\u00e9lie Matisse Portrait 1898.jpg|thumb|left|Two greyscale photos where each photo is in the shape of an oval: Henri Matisse (left) and Am\u00e9lie Matisse (right)|Henri and Am\u00e9lie Matisse, 1898]]\n[[File:Reading henri matisse.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Woman Reading]]'' (''La Liseuse''), 1895, oil on board, 61.5 x 48 cm, [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]], [[Matisse Museum (Le Cateau)|Mus\u00e9e Matisse]]]]\nMatisse was born in [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]], in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] [[Departments of France|department]] in Northern France, the oldest son of a wealthy grain merchant.<ref>Spurling, Hilary (2000).

He first started to paint in 1889, after his mother brought him art supplies during a period of convalescence following an attack of [[appendicitis]].

Initially he painted [[still life]]s and landscapes in a traditional style, at which he achieved reasonable proficiency. Matisse was influenced by the works of earlier masters such as [[Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin]], [[Nicolas Poussin]], and [[Antoine Watteau]], as well as by modern artists, such as [[\u00c9douard Manet]], and by [[Japanese art]]. Chardin was one of the painters Matisse most admired; as an art student he made copies of four of Chardin's paintings in the [[Louvre]].<ref>Spurling, Hilary.

Other members were [[Georges Braque]], [[Raoul Dufy]], and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]]. The [[Symbolist]] painter [[Gustave Moreau]] (1826\u20131898) was the movement's inspirational teacher. As a professor at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, he pushed his students to think outside of the lines of formality and to follow their visions.\n\nIn 1907, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in ''La Falange'', wrote, \"We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable.\"<ref>''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'', [[William Rubin]], published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, {{ISBN|0-87070-676-4}} p.348.</ref> But Matisse's work of the time also encountered vehement criticism, and it was difficult for him to provide for his family.<ref name=unknown/> His painting ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)|Nu bleu]]'' (1907) was burned in effigy at the [[Armory Show]] in Chicago in 1913.<ref name=Britannica>{{Britannica|369401}}</ref>\n\nThe decline of the Fauvist movement after 1906 did not affect the career of Matisse; many of his finest works were created between 1906 and 1917, when he was an active part of the great gathering of artistic talent in [[Montparnasse]], even though he did not quite fit in, with his conservative appearance and strict [[bourgeois]] work habits. He continued to absorb new influences. He travelled to [[Algeria]] in 1906 studying African art and [[Primitivism]]. After viewing a large exhibition of [[Islamic art]] in Munich in 1910, he spent two months in Spain studying Moorish art. He visited [[Morocco]] in 1912 and again in 1913 and while painting in [[Tangier]] he made several changes to his work, including his use of black as a colour.<ref name=\"The Moroccans\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79588|title=Henri Matisse.

One key difference between them is that Matisse drew and painted from nature, while Picasso was more inclined to work from imagination. The subjects painted most frequently by both artists were women and [[still life]]s, with Matisse more likely to place his figures in fully realised interiors. Matisse and Picasso were first brought together at the Paris [[salon (gathering)|salon]] of [[Gertrude Stein]] with her companion [[Alice B. Toklas]]. During the first decade of the twentieth century, the Americans in Paris\u2014Gertrude Stein, her brothers [[Leo Stein]], Michael Stein, and Michael's wife [[Sarah Stein|Sarah]]\u2014were important collectors and supporters of Matisse's paintings. In addition, Gertrude Stein's two American friends from [[Baltimore]], the [[Cone sisters]] Claribel and Etta, became major patrons of Matisse and Picasso, collecting hundreds of their paintings and drawings. The Cone collection is now exhibited in the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]].<ref>[http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html Cone Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019145733/http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html |date=19 October 2014 }}, Baltimore Museum of Art.

Gertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, remarking:\n\n<blockquote>\"More and more frequently, people began visiting to see the Matisse paintings\u2014and the C\u00e9zannes: Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began.\"<ref>Mellow, 1974, p. 84</ref>'</blockquote>\n\nAmong Pablo Picasso's acquaintances who also frequented the Saturday evenings were [[Fernande Olivier]] (Picasso's mistress), [[Georges Braque]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], the poets [[Max Jacob]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Marie Laurencin]] (Apollinaire's mistress and an artist in her own right), and [[Henri Rousseau]].<ref>Mellow, 1974, p. 94-95</ref>\n\nHis friends organized and financed the ''Acad\u00e9mie Matisse'' in Paris, a private and non-commercial school in which Matisse instructed young artists.

He worked with not only Frenchmen, Dutch, Germans, and Spaniards, but also a few Americans and recent American immigrants.\n\nAfter 1930, a new vigor and bolder simplification appeared in his work. American art collector [[Albert C. Barnes]] convinced Matisse to produce a large mural for the [[Barnes Foundation]], ''[[The Dance II]]'', which was completed in 1932; the Foundation owns several dozen other Matisse paintings. This move toward simplification and a foreshadowing of the cutout technique is also evident in his painting ''Large Reclining Nude'' (1935). Matisse worked on this painting for several months and documented the progress with a series of 22 photographs, which he sent to Etta Cone.<ref>[http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/uploaded_media/cone/matisse/index.html Henri Matisse Photographic documentation of 22 progressive states of Large Reclining Nude, 1935], The Jewish Museum {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529094429/http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/uploaded_media/cone/matisse/index.html |date=29 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==War years==\nMatisse's wife Am\u00e9lie, who suspected that he was having an affair with her young Russian emigre companion, [[Lydia Delectorskaya]], ended their 41-year marriage in July 1939, dividing their possessions equally between them.  Delectorskaya attempted suicide by shooting herself in the chest; remarkably, she survived with no serious after-effects, and instead returned to Matisse and worked with him for the rest of his life, running his household, paying the bills, typing his correspondence, keeping meticulous records, assisting in the studio and coordinating his business affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henri-matisse.net/biography.html|title=Biography of Henri Matisse|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMatisse was visiting Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 but managed to make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and remained in Nice, in Vichy France. \"It seemed to me as if I would be deserting,\" he wrote Pierre in September 1940. \"If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?\" Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, he had that option.<ref>\"Art & Politics in the Vichy Period,\" by Hilton Kramer, The New Criterion, March 1992 http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Art---politics-in-the-Vichy-period-4518</ref>\n\nWhile the Nazis occupied France from 1940 to 1944, they were more lenient in their attacks on \"degenerate art\" in Paris than they were in the German-speaking nations under their military dictatorship. Matisse was allowed to exhibit along with other former Fauves and Cubists whom Hitler had initially claimed to despise, though without any Jewish artists, all of whose works had been purged from all French museums and galleries; any French artists exhibiting in France had to sign an oath assuring their \"Aryan\" status\u2014including Matisse.<ref>Pryce-Jones, David (1981).

Holt, Rinehart & Winston, p. 220.</ref>  He also worked as a graphic artist and produced black-and-white illustrations for several books and over one hundred original lithographs at the [[Mourlot Studios]] in Paris.\n\nIn 1941, Matisse was diagnosed with duodenal cancer. The surgery, while successful, resulted in serious complications from which he nearly died.<ref>Daniels, Patricia. \"Matisse: A biography\".</ref> Being bedridden for three months resulted in his developing a new art form using paper and scissors.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lacayo |first=Richard |title=The Paper Chase.

A platonic friendship developed between Matisse and Bourgeois. He discovered that she was an amateur artist and taught her about perspective. After Bourgeois left the position to join a convent in 1944, Matisse sometimes contacted her to request that she model for him. Bourgeois became a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] nun in 1946, and Matisse painted a chapel in Vence, a small town he moved to in 1943, in her honor.\n\nMatisse remained for the most part isolated in southern France throughout the war but his family was intimately involved with the French resistance. His son Pierre, the art dealer in New York, helped the Jewish and anti-Nazi French artists he represented to escape occupied France and enter the United States. In 1942, he held an exhibition in New York, \"Artists in Exile,\" which was to become legendary.  Matisse's estranged wife, Am\u00e9lie, was a typist for the French Underground and jailed for six months. Matisse was shocked when he heard that his daughter Marguerite, who had been active in the [[R\u00e9sistance]] during the war, was tortured (almost to death) by the Gestapo in a Rennes prison and sentenced to the [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]] in Germany.<ref name=kuester/>  Marguerite managed to escape from the train to Ravensbr\u00fcck, which was halted during an Allied air raid; she survived in the woods in the chaos of the closing days of the war, until rescued by fellow resisters.<ref>Heftrig, Ruth; Olaf Peters; Barbara Maria Schellewald [editors] (2008), ''Kunstgeschichte im \"Dritten Reich\": Theorien, Methoden, Praktiken'', Akademie Verlag, p. 429; Spurling, Hilary, ''Matisse the Master: A Life of Henri Matisse, the Conquest of Colour, 1909\u20131954'', p.424.</ref> Matisse's student [[Rudolf Levy]] was killed in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in 1944.<ref name=\"Gilbert02\">{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Gilbert|title=The Routledge Atlas of the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pYs5OSnsrHwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Routledge+atlas+of+the+Holocaust#v=snippet&q=Rudolf%20Levy&f=false|year=2002|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=978-0-415-28145-4|page=10}}</ref><ref name=\"Ruhrberg\">{{cite book|last=Ruhrberg|first=Karl|title=Twentieth Century art: Painting and Sculpture in the Ludwig Museum|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VqRPAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22rudolf+levy%22+aushwitz&q=%22rudolf+levy%22+#search_anchor|year=1986|publisher=[[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]]|isbn=978-0-8478-0755-0|page=55}}</ref>\n\n==Final years==\n===Cut-outs===\n{{See also|Jazz (Henri Matisse)}}\nDiagnosed with abdominal cancer in 1941, Matisse underwent surgery that left him chair- and bedbound. Painting and sculpture had become physical challenges, so he turned to a new type of medium. With the help of his assistants, he began creating cut paper collages, or [[decoupage]]. He would cut sheets of paper, pre-painted with [[gouache]] by his assistants, into shapes of varying colours and sizes, and arrange them to form lively compositions. Initially, these pieces were modest in size, but eventually transformed into murals or room-sized works. The result was a distinct and dimensional complexity\u2014an art form that was not quite painting, but not quite sculpture.<ref>{{Citation | last =Cotter | first =Holland| title =Wisps From an Old Man's Dreams 'Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs,' a Victory Lap at MoMA\n | newspaper =New York Times| pages =| date =9 October 2014\n | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/arts/design/henri-matisse-the-cut-outs-a-victory-lap-at-moma.html| accessdate =17 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"The Cut-outs\">{{Citation| last =MoMA | title =Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs| pages =| year = 2014| url =http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1469| accessdate =19 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the paper cut-out was Matisse's major medium in the final decade of his life, his first recorded use of the technique was in 1919 during the design of decor for the ''[[Le chant du rossignol]]'', an opera composed by [[Igor Stravinsky]].<ref name=\"The Cut-outs\" /> [[Albert C. Barnes]] arranged for cardboard templates to be made of the unusual dimensions of the walls onto which Matisse, in his studio in Nice, fixed the composition of painted paper shapes. Another group of cut-outs were made between 1937 and 1938, while Matisse was working on the stage sets and costumes for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]]. However, it was only after his operation that, bedridden, Matisse began to develop the cut-out technique as its own form, rather than its prior utilitarian origin.<ref name=\"Elderfield 1978 8\">{{cite book | last =Elderfield | first =John | title =The Cut-Outs of Henri Matisse | publisher =George Braziller | date =1978 | location =New York | pages =[https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/8 8] | isbn =0807608866 | url =https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last =Matisse | first =Henri | title =Jazz | publisher =Prestel Publishing | date =2001 | location =New York | pages =10 | isbn =379132392X }}</ref><br />\n\nHe moved to the hilltop of [[Vence|Vence, France]] in 1943, where he produced his first major cut-out project for his artist's book titled ''[[Jazz (Henri Matisse)|Jazz]]''. However, these cut-outs were conceived as designs for stencil prints to be looked at in the book, rather than as independent pictorial works. At this point, Matisse still thought of the cut-outs as separate from his principal art form. His new understanding of this medium unfolds with the 1946 introduction for ''Jazz''. After summarizing his career, Matisse refers to the possibilities the cut-out technique offers, insisting \"An artist must never be a prisoner of himself, prisoner of a style, prisoner of a reputation, prisoner of success\u2026\"<ref name=\"Elderfield 1978 8\"/><br />\n\nThe number of independently conceived cut-outs steadily increased following ''Jazz'', and eventually led to the creation of mural-size works, such as ''Oceania the Sky'' and ''Oceania the Sea'' of 1946. Under Matisse's direction, Lydia Delectorskaya, his studio assistant, loosely pinned the silhouettes of birds, fish, and marine vegetation directly onto the walls of the room.

Many of his finest works were created in the decade or so after 1906, when he developed a rigorous style that emphasized flattened forms and decorative pattern. In 1917, he relocated to a suburb of [[Nice]] on the [[French Riviera]], and the more relaxed style of his work during the 1920s gained him critical acclaim as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting.<ref>Wattenmaker, Richard J.; [[Distel, Anne]], et al.

When ill health in his final years prevented him from painting, he created an important body of work in the medium of cut paper collage.\n\nHis mastery of the expressive language of colour and drawing, displayed in a body of work spanning over a half-century, won him recognition as a leading figure in [[modern art]].<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mati/hd_mati.htm Magdalena Dabrowski Department of Nineteenth-Century, Modern, and Contemporary Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art Source: Henri Matisse (1869\u20131954) | Thematic Essay | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art] Retrieved 30 June 2010.</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Henri + Am\u00e9lie Matisse Portrait 1898.jpg|thumb|left|Two greyscale photos where each photo is in the shape of an oval: Henri Matisse (left) and Am\u00e9lie Matisse (right)|Henri and Am\u00e9lie Matisse, 1898]]\n[[File:Reading henri matisse.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Woman Reading]]'' (''La Liseuse''), 1895, oil on board, 61.5 x 48 cm, [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]], [[Matisse Museum (Le Cateau)|Mus\u00e9e Matisse]]]]\nMatisse was born in [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]], in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] [[Departments of France|department]] in Northern France, the oldest son of a wealthy grain merchant.<ref>Spurling, Hilary (2000).

He first started to paint in 1889, after his mother brought him art supplies during a period of convalescence following an attack of [[appendicitis]].

Initially he painted [[still life]]s and landscapes in a traditional style, at which he achieved reasonable proficiency. Matisse was influenced by the works of earlier masters such as [[Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin]], [[Nicolas Poussin]], and [[Antoine Watteau]], as well as by modern artists, such as [[\u00c9douard Manet]], and by [[Japanese art]]. Chardin was one of the painters Matisse most admired; as an art student he made copies of four of Chardin's paintings in the [[Louvre]].<ref>Spurling, Hilary.

Other members were [[Georges Braque]], [[Raoul Dufy]], and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]]. The [[Symbolist]] painter [[Gustave Moreau]] (1826\u20131898) was the movement's inspirational teacher. As a professor at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, he pushed his students to think outside of the lines of formality and to follow their visions.\n\nIn 1907, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in ''La Falange'', wrote, \"We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable.\"<ref>''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'', [[William Rubin]], published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, {{ISBN|0-87070-676-4}} p.348.</ref> But Matisse's work of the time also encountered vehement criticism, and it was difficult for him to provide for his family.<ref name=unknown/> His painting ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)|Nu bleu]]'' (1907) was burned in effigy at the [[Armory Show]] in Chicago in 1913.<ref name=Britannica>{{Britannica|369401}}</ref>\n\nThe decline of the Fauvist movement after 1906 did not affect the career of Matisse; many of his finest works were created between 1906 and 1917, when he was an active part of the great gathering of artistic talent in [[Montparnasse]], even though he did not quite fit in, with his conservative appearance and strict [[bourgeois]] work habits. He continued to absorb new influences. He travelled to [[Algeria]] in 1906 studying African art and [[Primitivism]]. After viewing a large exhibition of [[Islamic art]] in Munich in 1910, he spent two months in Spain studying Moorish art. He visited [[Morocco]] in 1912 and again in 1913 and while painting in [[Tangier]] he made several changes to his work, including his use of black as a colour.<ref name=\"The Moroccans\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79588|title=Henri Matisse.

One key difference between them is that Matisse drew and painted from nature, while Picasso was more inclined to work from imagination. The subjects painted most frequently by both artists were women and [[still life]]s, with Matisse more likely to place his figures in fully realised interiors. Matisse and Picasso were first brought together at the Paris [[salon (gathering)|salon]] of [[Gertrude Stein]] with her companion [[Alice B. Toklas]]. During the first decade of the twentieth century, the Americans in Paris\u2014Gertrude Stein, her brothers [[Leo Stein]], Michael Stein, and Michael's wife [[Sarah Stein|Sarah]]\u2014were important collectors and supporters of Matisse's paintings. In addition, Gertrude Stein's two American friends from [[Baltimore]], the [[Cone sisters]] Claribel and Etta, became major patrons of Matisse and Picasso, collecting hundreds of their paintings and drawings. The Cone collection is now exhibited in the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]].<ref>[http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html Cone Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019145733/http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html |date=19 October 2014 }}, Baltimore Museum of Art.

Gertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, remarking:\n\n<blockquote>\"More and more frequently, people began visiting to see the Matisse paintings\u2014and the C\u00e9zannes: Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began.\"<ref>Mellow, 1974, p. 84</ref>'</blockquote>\n\nAmong Pablo Picasso's acquaintances who also frequented the Saturday evenings were [[Fernande Olivier]] (Picasso's mistress), [[Georges Braque]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], the poets [[Max Jacob]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Marie Laurencin]] (Apollinaire's mistress and an artist in her own right), and [[Henri Rousseau]].<ref>Mellow, 1974, p. 94-95</ref>\n\nHis friends organized and financed the ''Acad\u00e9mie Matisse'' in Paris, a private and non-commercial school in which Matisse instructed young artists.

He worked with not only Frenchmen, Dutch, Germans, and Spaniards, but also a few Americans and recent American immigrants.\n\nAfter 1930, a new vigor and bolder simplification appeared in his work. American art collector [[Albert C. Barnes]] convinced Matisse to produce a large mural for the [[Barnes Foundation]], ''[[The Dance II]]'', which was completed in 1932; the Foundation owns several dozen other Matisse paintings. This move toward simplification and a foreshadowing of the cutout technique is also evident in his painting ''Large Reclining Nude'' (1935). Matisse worked on this painting for several months and documented the progress with a series of 22 photographs, which he sent to Etta Cone.<ref>[http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/uploaded_media/cone/matisse/index.html Henri Matisse Photographic documentation of 22 progressive states of Large Reclining Nude, 1935], The Jewish Museum {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529094429/http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/uploaded_media/cone/matisse/index.html |date=29 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==War years==\nMatisse's wife Am\u00e9lie, who suspected that he was having an affair with her young Russian emigre companion, [[Lydia Delectorskaya]], ended their 41-year marriage in July 1939, dividing their possessions equally between them.  Delectorskaya attempted suicide by shooting herself in the chest; remarkably, she survived with no serious after-effects, and instead returned to Matisse and worked with him for the rest of his life, running his household, paying the bills, typing his correspondence, keeping meticulous records, assisting in the studio and coordinating his business affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henri-matisse.net/biography.html|title=Biography of Henri Matisse|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMatisse was visiting Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 but managed to make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and remained in Nice, in Vichy France. \"It seemed to me as if I would be deserting,\" he wrote Pierre in September 1940. \"If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?\" Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, he had that option.<ref>\"Art & Politics in the Vichy Period,\" by Hilton Kramer, The New Criterion, March 1992 http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Art---politics-in-the-Vichy-period-4518</ref>\n\nWhile the Nazis occupied France from 1940 to 1944, they were more lenient in their attacks on \"degenerate art\" in Paris than they were in the German-speaking nations under their military dictatorship. Matisse was allowed to exhibit along with other former Fauves and Cubists whom Hitler had initially claimed to despise, though without any Jewish artists, all of whose works had been purged from all French museums and galleries; any French artists exhibiting in France had to sign an oath assuring their \"Aryan\" status\u2014including Matisse.<ref>Pryce-Jones, David (1981).

Holt, Rinehart & Winston, p. 220.</ref>  He also worked as a graphic artist and produced black-and-white illustrations for several books and over one hundred original lithographs at the [[Mourlot Studios]] in Paris.\n\nIn 1941, Matisse was diagnosed with duodenal cancer. The surgery, while successful, resulted in serious complications from which he nearly died.<ref>Daniels, Patricia. \"Matisse: A biography\".</ref> Being bedridden for three months resulted in his developing a new art form using paper and scissors.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lacayo |first=Richard |title=The Paper Chase.

A platonic friendship developed between Matisse and Bourgeois. He discovered that she was an amateur artist and taught her about perspective. After Bourgeois left the position to join a convent in 1944, Matisse sometimes contacted her to request that she model for him. Bourgeois became a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] nun in 1946, and Matisse painted a chapel in Vence, a small town he moved to in 1943, in her honor.\n\nMatisse remained for the most part isolated in southern France throughout the war but his family was intimately involved with the French resistance. His son Pierre, the art dealer in New York, helped the Jewish and anti-Nazi French artists he represented to escape occupied France and enter the United States. In 1942, he held an exhibition in New York, \"Artists in Exile,\" which was to become legendary.  Matisse's estranged wife, Am\u00e9lie, was a typist for the French Underground and jailed for six months. Matisse was shocked when he heard that his daughter Marguerite, who had been active in the [[R\u00e9sistance]] during the war, was tortured (almost to death) by the Gestapo in a Rennes prison and sentenced to the [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]] in Germany.<ref name=kuester/>  Marguerite managed to escape from the train to Ravensbr\u00fcck, which was halted during an Allied air raid; she survived in the woods in the chaos of the closing days of the war, until rescued by fellow resisters.<ref>Heftrig, Ruth; Olaf Peters; Barbara Maria Schellewald [editors] (2008), ''Kunstgeschichte im \"Dritten Reich\": Theorien, Methoden, Praktiken'', Akademie Verlag, p. 429; Spurling, Hilary, ''Matisse the Master: A Life of Henri Matisse, the Conquest of Colour, 1909\u20131954'', p.424.</ref> Matisse's student [[Rudolf Levy]] was killed in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in 1944.<ref name=\"Gilbert02\">{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Gilbert|title=The Routledge Atlas of the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pYs5OSnsrHwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Routledge+atlas+of+the+Holocaust#v=snippet&q=Rudolf%20Levy&f=false|year=2002|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=978-0-415-28145-4|page=10}}</ref><ref name=\"Ruhrberg\">{{cite book|last=Ruhrberg|first=Karl|title=Twentieth Century art: Painting and Sculpture in the Ludwig Museum|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VqRPAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22rudolf+levy%22+aushwitz&q=%22rudolf+levy%22+#search_anchor|year=1986|publisher=[[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]]|isbn=978-0-8478-0755-0|page=55}}</ref>\n\n==Final years==\n===Cut-outs===\n{{See also|Jazz (Henri Matisse)}}\nDiagnosed with abdominal cancer in 1941, Matisse underwent surgery that left him chair- and bedbound. Painting and sculpture had become physical challenges, so he turned to a new type of medium. With the help of his assistants, he began creating cut paper collages, or [[decoupage]]. He would cut sheets of paper, pre-painted with [[gouache]] by his assistants, into shapes of varying colours and sizes, and arrange them to form lively compositions. Initially, these pieces were modest in size, but eventually transformed into murals or room-sized works. The result was a distinct and dimensional complexity\u2014an art form that was not quite painting, but not quite sculpture.<ref>{{Citation | last =Cotter | first =Holland| title =Wisps From an Old Man's Dreams 'Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs,' a Victory Lap at MoMA\n | newspaper =New York Times| pages =| date =9 October 2014\n | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/arts/design/henri-matisse-the-cut-outs-a-victory-lap-at-moma.html| accessdate =17 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"The Cut-outs\">{{Citation| last =MoMA | title =Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs| pages =| year = 2014| url =http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1469| accessdate =19 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the paper cut-out was Matisse's major medium in the final decade of his life, his first recorded use of the technique was in 1919 during the design of decor for the ''[[Le chant du rossignol]]'', an opera composed by [[Igor Stravinsky]].<ref name=\"The Cut-outs\" /> [[Albert C. Barnes]] arranged for cardboard templates to be made of the unusual dimensions of the walls onto which Matisse, in his studio in Nice, fixed the composition of painted paper shapes. Another group of cut-outs were made between 1937 and 1938, while Matisse was working on the stage sets and costumes for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]]. However, it was only after his operation that, bedridden, Matisse began to develop the cut-out technique as its own form, rather than its prior utilitarian origin.<ref name=\"Elderfield 1978 8\">{{cite book | last =Elderfield | first =John | title =The Cut-Outs of Henri Matisse | publisher =George Braziller | date =1978 | location =New York | pages =[https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/8 8] | isbn =0807608866 | url =https://archive.org/details/cutoutsofhenrima0000mati/page/8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last =Matisse | first =Henri | title =Jazz | publisher =Prestel Publishing | date =2001 | location =New York | pages =10 | isbn =379132392X }}</ref><br />\n\nHe moved to the hilltop of [[Vence|Vence, France]] in 1943, where he produced his first major cut-out project for his artist's book titled ''[[Jazz (Henri Matisse)|Jazz]]''. However, these cut-outs were conceived as designs for stencil prints to be looked at in the book, rather than as independent pictorial works. At this point, Matisse still thought of the cut-outs as separate from his principal art form. His new understanding of this medium unfolds with the 1946 introduction for ''Jazz''. After summarizing his career, Matisse refers to the possibilities the cut-out technique offers, insisting \"An artist must never be a prisoner of himself, prisoner of a style, prisoner of a reputation, prisoner of success\u2026\"<ref name=\"Elderfield 1978 8\"/><br />\n\nThe number of independently conceived cut-outs steadily increased following ''Jazz'', and eventually led to the creation of mural-size works, such as ''Oceania the Sky'' and ''Oceania the Sea'' of 1946. Under Matisse's direction, Lydia Delectorskaya, his studio assistant, loosely pinned the silhouettes of birds, fish, and marine vegetation directly onto the walls of the room.

During his political career, he represented three successive [[liberalism|liberal]] parties; he was the dominant figure of the [[German People's Party]] during the Weimar Republic.\n\n==Early years==\nStresemann was born on 10 May 1878 in 66 K\u00f6penicker Stra\u00dfe in Southeast [[Berlin]], the youngest of seven children.  His father worked as a beer bottler and distributor, and also ran a small bar out of the family home, as well as renting rooms for extra money.  The family was lower middle class, but relatively well-off for the neighbourhood, and had sufficient funds to provide Gustav with a high-quality education.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=10}}\nStresemann was an excellent student, particularly excelling in German literature and poetry. At the age of 16, he joined the Andreas Gymnasium to study. His parents brought him to have an interest in books - He was especially passionate about history, with his teacher, Mr. Wolff, commenting that he had an \"almost sickly taste in history\". He took an interest in [[Napoleon]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], whom he later wrote about in his work ''1924: Goethe und Napoleon: ein Vortrag''.<ref>Stresemann, Gustav. ''Goethe und Napoleon: ein Vortrag; with Anhang Weimarer Tagebuch'', Berlin, 1924</ref> His mother, Mathilde, died in 1895. From December 1895, he wrote \"Berlin letters\" for the [[Dresdener Volks-Zeitung]], often talking about politics and targeting Prussian conservatives. In an essay written when he left school, he noted that he would have enjoyed becoming a teacher, but he would only have been qualified to teach languages or the natural sciences, which were not his primary areas of interest.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=8}} Due to this, he enrolled in University.\n\nIn April 1897, Stresemann enrolled in the University of Berlin, where he was convinced by a businessman to study political economy instead of literature.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=15}} During his university years, Stresemann also became active in [[Burschenschaften]] movement of student fraternities, and became editor, in April 1898, of the ''Allgemeine Deutsche Universit\u00e4ts-Zeitung'', a newspaper run by Konrad Kuster, a leader in the liberal portion of the Burschenschaften. His editorials for the paper were often political, and dismissed most of the contemporary political parties as broken in one way or another.{{sfn|Wright|2002|pp=17\u20138}}  In these early writings, he set out views that combined liberalism with strident nationalism, a combination that would dominate his views for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=20}} In 1898, Stresemann left the University of Berlin, transferring to the [[University of Leipzig]] so that he could pursue a doctorate. He studied History, International Law, and took literature courses. Influenced by Dr. Martin Kriele, he also took courses in Economics. In March 1899, he stopped becoming an editor for the ''Allgemeine Deutsche Universit\u00e4ts-Zeitung''. He completed his studies in January 1901, submitting a [[thesis]] on the bottled beer industry in Berlin, which received a relatively high grade, but was a subject of mockery from colleagues.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=23}}<ref>Hirsch, Felix.

[\"The development of the bottled beer trade in Berlin. An economic study \"]. Dissertation University of Leipzig 1901</ref> Stresemann's doctoral supervisor was the economist [[Karl B\u00fccher]].{{sfn|Pohl|2015|p=73}} \n\nIn 1902 he founded the [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxon]] Manufacturers' Association. In 1903 he married [[K\u00e4te Stresemann|K\u00e4te Kleefeld]] (1883\u20131970), daughter of a wealthy Jewish Berlin businessman, and the sister of [[Kurt von Kleefeld]], the last person in Germany to  be ennobled (in 1918). At that time he was also a member of [[Friedrich Naumann]]'s [[National-Social Association]]. In 1906 he was elected to the [[Dresden]] town council. Though he had initially worked in trade associations, Stresemann soon became a leader of the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] in Saxony. In 1907, he was elected to the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]], where he soon became a close associate of party chairman [[Ernst Bassermann]]. However, his support of expanded social-welfare programs did not sit well with some of the party's more conservative members, and he lost his post in the party's executive committee in 1912. Later that year he lost both his Reichstag and town council seats. He returned to business and founded the German-American Economic Association. In 1914 he returned to the Reichstag. He was exempted from war service due to poor health.  With Bassermann kept away from the Reichstag by either illness or military service, Stresemann soon became the National Liberals' de facto leader.  After Bassermann's death in 1917, Stresemann succeeded him as the party leader.\n\nThe evolution of his political ideas appears somewhat erratic. Initially, in the [[German Empire]], Stresemann was associated with the left wing of the National Liberals. During [[World War I]], he gradually moved to the right, expressing his support of the monarchy and Germany's expansionist goals. He was a vocal proponent of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]].  However, he still favoured an expansion of the social welfare programme, and also supported an end to the restrictive [[Prussian three-class franchise|Prussian franchise]].\n\nWhen the Allies' peace terms became known, including a crushing burden of paying reparations for the war, [[Constantin Fehrenbach]] denounced them and claimed \"the will to break the chains of slavery would be implanted\" into a generation of Germans. Stresemann said of this speech: \"He was inspired in that hour by God to say what was felt by the German people. His words, spoken under [[Johann Fichte|Fichte]]'s portrait, the final words of which merged into \u201c''Deutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber alles''\u201d, made it an unforgettably solemn hour. There was in that sense a kind of uplifting grandeur. The impression left on all was tremendous\".{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1964|loc=p. 48, n. 2}}\n\nStresemann briefly joined the [[German Democratic Party]] after the war, but was expelled for his association with the right wing. He then gathered the main body of the old National Liberal Party\u2014including most of its centre and right factions\u2014into the [[German People's Party]] ({{lang-de|Deutsche Volkspartei}}, DVP), with himself as chairman. Most of its support came from middle class and upper class Protestants. The DVP platform promoted Christian family values, secular education, lower tariffs, opposition to welfare spending and agrarian subsidies and hostility to \"[[Marxism]]\" (that is, the [[Communism|Communists]], and also the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]]).\n\nThe DVP was initially seen, along with the [[German National People's Party]], as part of the \"national opposition\" to the Weimar Republic, particularly for its grudging acceptance of democracy and its ambivalent attitude towards the [[Freikorps]] and the [[Kapp Putsch]] in 1920.  By late 1920, Stresemann gradually moved to cooperation with the parties of the left and centre \u2014 possibly in reaction to political murders like that of [[Walther Rathenau]].  However, he remained a monarchist at heart.\n\n==In the Weimar Republic==\n===Chancellor 1923===\nOn 13 August 1923, Stresemann was appointed Chancellor and Foreign Minister of a grand coalition [[First Stresemann cabinet|government]] in the so-called ''[[1923 in Germany|year of crises]]'' (1923). In social policy, a new system of binding arbitration was introduced in October 1923 in which an outside arbitrator had the final say in industrial disputes.<ref>AQA History: The Development of Germany, 1871-1925 by Sally Waller</ref> \n\nOn the 26 September 1923, Stresemann announced the end to the passive resistance against the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] by the French and Belgians, in tandem with an [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] (of the [[Weimar Constitution]]) state of emergency proclamation by [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]] Ebert that lasted until February 1924.{{sfn|Mulligan|2005|p=173}}{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=64}}  In October 1923, the Stresemann government used Article 48 to replace the legally elected SPD-Communist coalition government of Saxony on 29 October, and that of Thuringia on 6 November, by commissioners. By this time, Stresemann was convinced that accepting the republic and reaching an understanding with the Allies on the reparations issue was the only way for Germany to gain the breathing room it needed to rebuild its battered economy.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=64}} He also wished to recover the Rhineland, as he wrote to the Crown Prince on 23 July 1923: \"The most important objective of German politics is the liberation of German territory from French and Belgian occupation. First, we must remove the strangler from our throat\".{{sfn|Schwarzschild|1943|p=186}}\n\n[[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic]] would reach its peak in November 1923.{{sfn|Fischer|2010|p=67}} Since Germany was no longer able to pay the striking workers, more and more money was printed, which finally led to hyperinflation. Stresemann introduced a new currency, the [[Rentenmark]], to end hyperinflation.  He also persuaded the French to pull back from the Ruhr in return for a promise that reparations payments would resume.  This was part of his larger strategy of \"fulfillment.\" Although he, like nearly every other German politician, cursed the Treaty of Versailles as a ''[[Diktat]],'' he had come to believe that Germany would never win relief from its terms unless it made a good-faith effort to fulfill them. To his mind, this would convince the Allies that the reparations bill was truly beyond Germany's capacity.  The effort paid off; the Allies began to take a look at reforming the reparations scheme.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=108-109}}\n\nIn early November 1923, partly because of the reaction to the overthrowing of the SPD/KPD governments in Saxony and Thuringia, the Social Democrats withdrew from his [[Second Stresemann cabinet|reshuffled government]] and after a motion of confidence was voted down on 23 November 1923 Stresemann and his cabinet resigned.\n\n===Foreign Minister 1923-29===\nStresemann remained as Foreign Minister in the government of his successor, [[Catholic Centre Party|Centrist]] [[Wilhelm Marx]]. He remained foreign minister for the rest of his life in eight successive governments ranging from the centre-right to the centre-left. As Foreign Minister, Stresemann had numerous achievements. His first notable achievement was the [[Dawes Plan]] of 1924, which reduced Germany's overall reparations commitment and reorganized the [[Reichsbank]].\n\nAfter Sir [[Austen Chamberlain]] became British Foreign Secretary, he wanted a British guarantee to France and Belgium as the Anglo-American guarantee had fallen due to the United States' refusal to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. Stresemann later wrote: \"Chamberlain had never been our friend. His first act was to attempt to restore the old Entente through a three-power alliance of England, France and Belgium, directed against Germany. German diplomacy faced a catastrophic situation\".{{sfn|Schwarzschild|1943|p=156}}\n\nStresemann conceived the idea that Germany would guarantee her western borders and pledged never to invade Belgium and France again, along with a guarantee from Britain that they would come to Germany's aid if attacked by France. Germany was in no position at the time to attack, as Stresemann wrote to the Crown Prince: \"The renunciation of a military conflict with France has only a theoretical significance, in so far as there is no possibility of a war with France\".{{sfn|Schwarzschild|1943|p=157}} Stresemann negotiated the [[Locarno Treaties]] with Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium. On the third day of negotiations Stresemann explained Germany's demands to the French Foreign Secretary, [[Aristide Briand]]. As Stresemann recorded, Briand \"almost fell off his sofa, when he heard my explanations\". Stresemann said that Germany alone should not make sacrifices for peace; European countries should cede colonies to Germany; the disarmament control commission should leave Germany; the Anglo-French occupation of the Rhineland should be ended; and Britain and France should disarm as Germany had done.{{sfn|Schwarzschild|1943|p=161}} The Treaties were signed in October 1925 at Locarno. Germany officially recognized the post-World War I western border for the first time,<ref>That is, for the first time of its own accord. Germany had, of course, quite officially recognized them in the Versailles treaty, but had not been in a position to refuse to sign.</ref> and was guaranteed peace with France, and promised admission to the League of Nations and evacuation of the last Allied occupation troops from the Rhineland.\n\n[[File:Stresemann-Bauer.JPG|thumb|Heinrich Bauer's biography of Stresemann]]\nStresemann was not willing to conclude a similar treaty with Poland: \"There will be no Locarno of the east\" he said.<ref>Heinrich Bauer: Stresemann ein deutscher Staatsmann\", Berlin 1930. First biography of Stresemann.The author stood in contact to Stresemann for years.</ref> Moreover, he never excluded the use of force to regain the eastern territories of former German Empire which had come under Polish control as a consequence of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].\n\nAfter this reconciliation with the Versailles powers, Stresemann moved to allay the growing suspicion of the Soviet Union. He said to [[Nikolay Krestinsky]] in June 1925, as recorded in his diary: \"I had said I would not come to conclude a treaty with Russia so long as our political situation in the other direction was not cleared up, as I wanted to answer the question whether we had a treaty with Russia in the negative\".{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1964|p=142}} The [[Treaty of Berlin, 1926|Treaty of Berlin]] signed in April 1926 reaffirmed and strengthened the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Rapallo Treaty]] of 1922. In September 1926, Germany was admitted to the [[League of Nations]] as permanent member of the Security Council. This was a sign that Germany was quickly becoming a normal state, and assured the Soviet Union of Germany's sincerity in the Treaty of Berlin.\n\nStresemann wrote to the Crown Prince: \"All the questions which to-day preoccupy the German people can be transformed into as many vexations for the Entente by a skilful orator before the League of Nations\". As Germany now had a veto on League resolutions, she could gain concessions from other countries on modifications on the Polish border or Anschluss with Austria, as other countries needed her vote. Germany could now act as \"the spokesman of the whole German cultural community\" and thereby provoke the German minorities in Czechoslovakia and Poland.{{sfn|Schwarzschild|1943|p=168}}\n\nStresemann was co-winner of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1926 for these achievements.\n\nGermany signed the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] in August 1928. It renounced the use of violence to resolve international conflicts. Although Stresemann did not propose the pact, Germany's adherence convinced many people that Weimar Germany was a Germany that could be reasoned with. This new insight was instrumental in the [[Young Plan]] of February 1929 which led to more reductions in German reparations payment.\n\nGustav Stresemann's success owed much to his friendly personal character and his willingness to be pragmatic. He was close personal friends with many influential foreigners. The most noted was Briand, with whom he shared the Peace Prize.<ref>Annelise Thimme. \"Stresemann and Locarno\", 74</ref>\n\nStresemann was not, however, in any sense pro-French. His main preoccupation was how to free Germany from the burden of [[World War I reparations|reparations]] payments to Britain and France, imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. His strategy for this was to forge an economic alliance with the [[United States]]. The U.S. was Germany's main source of food and raw materials, and one of Germany's largest export markets for manufactured goods. Germany's economic recovery was thus in the interests of the U.S., and gave the U.S. an incentive to help Germany escape from the reparations burden. The Dawes and Young plans were the result of this strategy. Stresemann had a close relationship with [[Herbert Hoover]], who was [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] in 1921-28 and President from 1929. This strategy worked remarkably well until it was derailed by the [[Great Depression]] after Stresemann's death.{{sfn|Tooze|2007|p=6}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-08485B, Karlsbad, Gustav Stresemann mit Gattin und Sohn.jpg|thumb|Stresemann in September 1929 shortly before his death with his wife K\u00e4the and son Wolfgang]]\nDuring his period in the foreign ministry, Stresemann came more and more to accept the Republic, which he had at first rejected. By the mid-1920s, having contributed much to a (temporary) consolidation of the feeble democratic order, Stresemann was regarded as a ''Vernunftrepublikaner''  (republican by reason) - someone who accepted the Republic as the least of all evils, but was in his heart still loyal to the monarchy. The conservative opposition criticized him for his supporting the republic and fulfilling too willingly the demands of the Western powers. Along with [[Matthias Erzberger]] and others, he was attacked as a ''Erf\u00fcllungspolitiker'' (\"fulfillment politician\").  Indeed, some of the more conservative members of his own People's Party never really trusted him.\n\nIn 1925, when he first proposed an agreement with France, he made it clear that in doing so he intended to \"gain a free hand to secure a peaceful change of the borders in the East and [...] concentrate on a later incorporation of German territories in the East\".<ref>Stresemann in an article for the ''Hamburger Fremdenblatt'', 10 April 1922, quoted after [[Martin Broszat]], ''200 Jahre deutsche Polenpolitik'', Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1972, p.220.</ref> In the same year, while Poland was in a state of political and economic crisis, Stresemann began a [[trade war]] against the country. Stresemann hoped for an escalation of the Polish crisis, which would enable Germany to regain territories ceded to Poland after World War I, and he wanted Germany to gain a larger market for its products there. So Stresemann refused to engage in any international cooperation that would have \"prematurely\" restabilized the Polish economy. In response to a British proposal, Stresemann wrote to the German ambassador in London: \"[A] final and lasting recapitalization of Poland must be delayed until the country is ripe for a settlement of the border according to our wishes and until our own position is sufficiently strong\". According to Stresemann's letter, there should be no settlement \"until [Poland's] economic and financial distress has reached an extreme stage and reduced the entire Polish body politic to a state of powerlessness\".<ref>Stresemann in a letter to the German ambassador in London, quoted after Broszat (see above), p. 224.</ref> Stresseman hoped to annex Polish territories in [[Greater Poland]], take over whole eastern [[Upper Silesia]] and parts of Central Silesia and the entire so called [[Polish Corridor]]. Besides waging economic war on Poland, Streseman funded extensive propaganda efforts and plotted to collaborate with Soviet Union against Polish statehood.<ref>THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC AND THE GERMAN-POLISH BORDERS Journal Article THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC AND THE GERMAN-POLISH BORDERS CHRISTOPH M.

He was co-laureate of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1926.\n\nHis most notable achievement was the reconciliation between Germany and France, for which he and [[Aristide Briand]] received the Nobel Peace Prize. During a period of political instability and fragile, short-lived governments, he was generally seen as the most influential cabinet member in most of the Weimar Republic's existence. During his political career, he represented three successive [[liberalism|liberal]] parties; he was the dominant figure of the [[German People's Party]] during the Weimar Republic.\n\n==Early years==\nStresemann was born on 10 May 1878 in 66 K\u00f6penicker Stra\u00dfe in Southeast [[Berlin]], the youngest of seven children.  His father worked as a beer bottler and distributor, and also ran a small bar out of the family home, as well as renting rooms for extra money.  The family was lower middle class, but relatively well-off for the neighbourhood, and had sufficient funds to provide Gustav with a high-quality education.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=10}}\nStresemann was an excellent student, particularly excelling in German literature and poetry. At the age of 16, he joined the Andreas Gymnasium to study. His parents brought him to have an interest in books - He was especially passionate about history, with his teacher, Mr. Wolff, commenting that he had an \"almost sickly taste in history\". He took an interest in [[Napoleon]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], whom he later wrote about in his work ''1924: Goethe und Napoleon: ein Vortrag''.<ref>Stresemann, Gustav. ''Goethe und Napoleon: ein Vortrag; with Anhang Weimarer Tagebuch'', Berlin, 1924</ref> His mother, Mathilde, died in 1895. From December 1895, he wrote \"Berlin letters\" for the [[Dresdener Volks-Zeitung]], often talking about politics and targeting Prussian conservatives. In an essay written when he left school, he noted that he would have enjoyed becoming a teacher, but he would only have been qualified to teach languages or the natural sciences, which were not his primary areas of interest.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=8}} Due to this, he enrolled in University.\n\nIn April 1897, Stresemann enrolled in the University of Berlin, where he was convinced by a businessman to study political economy instead of literature.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=15}} During his university years, Stresemann also became active in [[Burschenschaften]] movement of student fraternities, and became editor, in April 1898, of the ''Allgemeine Deutsche Universit\u00e4ts-Zeitung'', a newspaper run by Konrad Kuster, a leader in the liberal portion of the Burschenschaften. His editorials for the paper were often political, and dismissed most of the contemporary political parties as broken in one way or another.{{sfn|Wright|2002|pp=17\u20138}}  In these early writings, he set out views that combined liberalism with strident nationalism, a combination that would dominate his views for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=20}} In 1898, Stresemann left the University of Berlin, transferring to the [[University of Leipzig]] so that he could pursue a doctorate. He studied History, International Law, and took literature courses. Influenced by Dr. Martin Kriele, he also took courses in Economics. In March 1899, he stopped becoming an editor for the ''Allgemeine Deutsche Universit\u00e4ts-Zeitung''. He completed his studies in January 1901, submitting a [[thesis]] on the bottled beer industry in Berlin, which received a relatively high grade, but was a subject of mockery from colleagues.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=23}}<ref>Hirsch, Felix. ''Gustav Stresemann''. 1878/1978, Berlin, Berlin Verlag, 1978</ref><ref>Gustav Stresemann: ''Die Entwicklung Berliner Flaschenbiergesch\u00e4fts. Eine wirtschaftliche Studie''. [\"The development of the bottled beer trade in Berlin. An economic study \"]. Dissertation University of Leipzig 1901</ref> Stresemann's doctoral supervisor was the economist [[Karl B\u00fccher]].{{sfn|Pohl|2015|p=73}} \n\nIn 1902 he founded the [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxon]] Manufacturers' Association. In 1903 he married [[K\u00e4te Stresemann|K\u00e4te Kleefeld]] (1883\u20131970), daughter of a wealthy Jewish Berlin businessman, and the sister of [[Kurt von Kleefeld]], the last person in Germany to  be ennobled (in 1918). At that time he was also a member of [[Friedrich Naumann]]'s [[National-Social Association]]. In 1906 he was elected to the [[Dresden]] town council. Though he had initially worked in trade associations, Stresemann soon became a leader of the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] in Saxony. In 1907, he was elected to the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]], where he soon became a close associate of party chairman [[Ernst Bassermann]]. However, his support of expanded social-welfare programs did not sit well with some of the party's more conservative members, and he lost his post in the party's executive committee in 1912. Later that year he lost both his Reichstag and town council seats. He returned to business and founded the German-American Economic Association. In 1914 he returned to the Reichstag. He was exempted from war service due to poor health.  With Bassermann kept away from the Reichstag by either illness or military service, Stresemann soon became the National Liberals' de facto leader.  After Bassermann's death in 1917, Stresemann succeeded him as the party leader.\n\nThe evolution of his political ideas appears somewhat erratic. Initially, in the [[German Empire]], Stresemann was associated with the left wing of the National Liberals. During [[World War I]], he gradually moved to the right, expressing his support of the monarchy and Germany's expansionist goals. He was a vocal proponent of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]].  However, he still favoured an expansion of the social welfare programme, and also supported an end to the restrictive [[Prussian three-class franchise|Prussian franchise]].\n\nWhen the Allies' peace terms became known, including a crushing burden of paying reparations for the war, [[Constantin Fehrenbach]] denounced them and claimed \"the will to break the chains of slavery would be implanted\" into a generation of Germans. Stresemann said of this speech: \"He was inspired in that hour by God to say what was felt by the German people. His words, spoken under [[Johann Fichte|Fichte]]'s portrait, the final words of which merged into \u201c''Deutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber alles''\u201d, made it an unforgettably solemn hour. There was in that sense a kind of uplifting grandeur. The impression left on all was tremendous\".{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1964|loc=p. 48, n. 2}}\n\nStresemann briefly joined the [[German Democratic Party]] after the war, but was expelled for his association with the right wing. He then gathered the main body of the old National Liberal Party\u2014including most of its centre and right factions\u2014into the [[German People's Party]] ({{lang-de|Deutsche Volkspartei}}, DVP), with himself as chairman. Most of its support came from middle class and upper class Protestants. The DVP platform promoted Christian family values, secular education, lower tariffs, opposition to welfare spending and agrarian subsidies and hostility to \"[[Marxism]]\" (that is, the [[Communism|Communists]], and also the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]]).\n\nThe DVP was initially seen, along with the [[German National People's Party]], as part of the \"national opposition\" to the Weimar Republic, particularly for its grudging acceptance of democracy and its ambivalent attitude towards the [[Freikorps]] and the [[Kapp Putsch]] in 1920.  By late 1920, Stresemann gradually moved to cooperation with the parties of the left and centre \u2014 possibly in reaction to political murders like that of [[Walther Rathenau]].  However, he remained a monarchist at heart.\n\n==In the Weimar Republic==\n===Chancellor 1923===\nOn 13 August 1923, Stresemann was appointed Chancellor and Foreign Minister of a grand coalition [[First Stresemann cabinet|government]] in the so-called ''[[1923 in Germany|year of crises]]'' (1923). In social policy, a new system of binding arbitration was introduced in October 1923 in which an outside arbitrator had the final say in industrial disputes.<ref>AQA History: The Development of Germany, 1871-1925 by Sally Waller</ref> \n\nOn the 26 September 1923, Stresemann announced the end to the passive resistance against the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] by the French and Belgians, in tandem with an [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] (of the [[Weimar Constitution]]) state of emergency proclamation by [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]] Ebert that lasted until February 1924.{{sfn|Mulligan|2005|p=173}}{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=64}}  In October 1923, the Stresemann government used Article 48 to replace the legally elected SPD-Communist coalition government of Saxony on 29 October, and that of Thuringia on 6 November, by commissioners. By this time, Stresemann was convinced that accepting the republic and reaching an understanding with the Allies on the reparations issue was the only way for Germany to gain the breathing room it needed to rebuild its battered economy.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=64}} He also wished to recover the Rhineland, as he wrote to the Crown Prince on 23 July 1923: \"The most important objective of German politics is the liberation of German territory from French and Belgian occupation. First, we must remove the strangler from our throat\".{{sfn|Schwarzschild|1943|p=186}}\n\n[[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic]] would reach its peak in November 1923.{{sfn|Fischer|2010|p=67}} Since Germany was no longer able to pay the striking workers, more and more money was printed, which finally led to hyperinflation. Stresemann introduced a new currency, the [[Rentenmark]], to end hyperinflation.  He also persuaded the French to pull back from the Ruhr in return for a promise that reparations payments would resume.  This was part of his larger strategy of \"fulfillment.\" Although he, like nearly every other German politician, cursed the Treaty of Versailles as a ''[[Diktat]],'' he had come to believe that Germany would never win relief from its terms unless it made a good-faith effort to fulfill them. To his mind, this would convince the Allies that the reparations bill was truly beyond Germany's capacity.  The effort paid off; the Allies began to take a look at reforming the reparations scheme.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=108-109}}\n\nIn early November 1923, partly because of the reaction to the overthrowing of the SPD/KPD governments in Saxony and Thuringia, the Social Democrats withdrew from his [[Second Stresemann cabinet|reshuffled government]] and after a motion of confidence was voted down on 23 November 1923 Stresemann and his cabinet resigned.\n\n===Foreign Minister 1923-29===\nStresemann remained as Foreign Minister in the government of his successor, [[Catholic Centre Party|Centrist]] [[Wilhelm Marx]]. He remained foreign minister for the rest of his life in eight successive governments ranging from the centre-right to the centre-left. As Foreign Minister, Stresemann had numerous achievements. His first notable achievement was the [[Dawes Plan]] of 1924, which reduced Germany's overall reparations commitment and reorganized the [[Reichsbank]].\n\nAfter Sir [[Austen Chamberlain]] became British Foreign Secretary, he wanted a British guarantee to France and Belgium as the Anglo-American guarantee had fallen due to the United States' refusal to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. Stresemann later wrote: \"Chamberlain had never been our friend. His first act was to attempt to restore the old Entente through a three-power alliance of England, France and Belgium, directed against Germany. German diplomacy faced a catastrophic situation\".{{sfn|Schwarzschild|1943|p=156}}\n\nStresemann conceived the idea that Germany would guarantee her western borders and pledged never to invade Belgium and France again, along with a guarantee from Britain that they would come to Germany's aid if attacked by France. Germany was in no position at the time to attack, as Stresemann wrote to the Crown Prince: \"The renunciation of a military conflict with France has only a theoretical significance, in so far as there is no possibility of a war with France\".{{sfn|Schwarzschild|1943|p=157}} Stresemann negotiated the [[Locarno Treaties]] with Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium. On the third day of negotiations Stresemann explained Germany's demands to the French Foreign Secretary, [[Aristide Briand]]. As Stresemann recorded, Briand \"almost fell off his sofa, when he heard my explanations\". Stresemann said that Germany alone should not make sacrifices for peace; European countries should cede colonies to Germany; the disarmament control commission should leave Germany; the Anglo-French occupation of the Rhineland should be ended; and Britain and France should disarm as Germany had done.{{sfn|Schwarzschild|1943|p=161}} The Treaties were signed in October 1925 at Locarno. Germany officially recognized the post-World War I western border for the first time,<ref>That is, for the first time of its own accord. Germany had, of course, quite officially recognized them in the Versailles treaty, but had not been in a position to refuse to sign.</ref> and was guaranteed peace with France, and promised admission to the League of Nations and evacuation of the last Allied occupation troops from the Rhineland.\n\n[[File:Stresemann-Bauer.JPG|thumb|Heinrich Bauer's biography of Stresemann]]\nStresemann was not willing to conclude a similar treaty with Poland: \"There will be no Locarno of the east\" he said.<ref>Heinrich Bauer: Stresemann ein deutscher Staatsmann\", Berlin 1930. First biography of Stresemann.The author stood in contact to Stresemann for years.</ref> Moreover, he never excluded the use of force to regain the eastern territories of former German Empire which had come under Polish control as a consequence of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].\n\nAfter this reconciliation with the Versailles powers, Stresemann moved to allay the growing suspicion of the Soviet Union. He said to [[Nikolay Krestinsky]] in June 1925, as recorded in his diary: \"I had said I would not come to conclude a treaty with Russia so long as our political situation in the other direction was not cleared up, as I wanted to answer the question whether we had a treaty with Russia in the negative\".{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1964|p=142}} The [[Treaty of Berlin, 1926|Treaty of Berlin]] signed in April 1926 reaffirmed and strengthened the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Rapallo Treaty]] of 1922. In September 1926, Germany was admitted to the [[League of Nations]] as permanent member of the Security Council. This was a sign that Germany was quickly becoming a normal state, and assured the Soviet Union of Germany's sincerity in the Treaty of Berlin.\n\nStresemann wrote to the Crown Prince: \"All the questions which to-day preoccupy the German people can be transformed into as many vexations for the Entente by a skilful orator before the League of Nations\". As Germany now had a veto on League resolutions, she could gain concessions from other countries on modifications on the Polish border or Anschluss with Austria, as other countries needed her vote. Germany could now act as \"the spokesman of the whole German cultural community\" and thereby provoke the German minorities in Czechoslovakia and Poland.{{sfn|Schwarzschild|1943|p=168}}\n\nStresemann was co-winner of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1926 for these achievements.\n\nGermany signed the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] in August 1928. It renounced the use of violence to resolve international conflicts. Although Stresemann did not propose the pact, Germany's adherence convinced many people that Weimar Germany was a Germany that could be reasoned with. This new insight was instrumental in the [[Young Plan]] of February 1929 which led to more reductions in German reparations payment.\n\nGustav Stresemann's success owed much to his friendly personal character and his willingness to be pragmatic. He was close personal friends with many influential foreigners. The most noted was Briand, with whom he shared the Peace Prize.<ref>Annelise Thimme. \"Stresemann and Locarno\", 74</ref>\n\nStresemann was not, however, in any sense pro-French. His main preoccupation was how to free Germany from the burden of [[World War I reparations|reparations]] payments to Britain and France, imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. His strategy for this was to forge an economic alliance with the [[United States]]. The U.S. was Germany's main source of food and raw materials, and one of Germany's largest export markets for manufactured goods. Germany's economic recovery was thus in the interests of the U.S., and gave the U.S. an incentive to help Germany escape from the reparations burden. The Dawes and Young plans were the result of this strategy. Stresemann had a close relationship with [[Herbert Hoover]], who was [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] in 1921-28 and President from 1929. This strategy worked remarkably well until it was derailed by the [[Great Depression]] after Stresemann's death.{{sfn|Tooze|2007|p=6}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-08485B, Karlsbad, Gustav Stresemann mit Gattin und Sohn.jpg|thumb|Stresemann in September 1929 shortly before his death with his wife K\u00e4the and son Wolfgang]]\nDuring his period in the foreign ministry, Stresemann came more and more to accept the Republic, which he had at first rejected. By the mid-1920s, having contributed much to a (temporary) consolidation of the feeble democratic order, Stresemann was regarded as a ''Vernunftrepublikaner''  (republican by reason) - someone who accepted the Republic as the least of all evils, but was in his heart still loyal to the monarchy. The conservative opposition criticized him for his supporting the republic and fulfilling too willingly the demands of the Western powers. Along with [[Matthias Erzberger]] and others, he was attacked as a ''Erf\u00fcllungspolitiker'' (\"fulfillment politician\").  Indeed, some of the more conservative members of his own People's Party never really trusted him.\n\nIn 1925, when he first proposed an agreement with France, he made it clear that in doing so he intended to \"gain a free hand to secure a peaceful change of the borders in the East and [...] concentrate on a later incorporation of German territories in the East\".<ref>Stresemann in an article for the ''Hamburger Fremdenblatt'', 10 April 1922, quoted after [[Martin Broszat]], ''200 Jahre deutsche Polenpolitik'', Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1972, p.220.</ref> In the same year, while Poland was in a state of political and economic crisis, Stresemann began a [[trade war]] against the country. Stresemann hoped for an escalation of the Polish crisis, which would enable Germany to regain territories ceded to Poland after World War I, and he wanted Germany to gain a larger market for its products there. So Stresemann refused to engage in any international cooperation that would have \"prematurely\" restabilized the Polish economy. In response to a British proposal, Stresemann wrote to the German ambassador in London: \"[A] final and lasting recapitalization of Poland must be delayed until the country is ripe for a settlement of the border according to our wishes and until our own position is sufficiently strong\". According to Stresemann's letter, there should be no settlement \"until [Poland's] economic and financial distress has reached an extreme stage and reduced the entire Polish body politic to a state of powerlessness\".<ref>Stresemann in a letter to the German ambassador in London, quoted after Broszat (see above), p. 224.</ref> Stresseman hoped to annex Polish territories in [[Greater Poland]], take over whole eastern [[Upper Silesia]] and parts of Central Silesia and the entire so called [[Polish Corridor]]. Besides waging economic war on Poland, Streseman funded extensive propaganda efforts and plotted to collaborate with Soviet Union against Polish statehood.<ref>THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC AND THE GERMAN-POLISH BORDERS Journal Article THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC AND THE GERMAN-POLISH BORDERS CHRISTOPH M.

O'Sullivan was eligible to compete in the event, but chose not to participate; his entry was given to [[Ali Carter]], who reached the final where he played [[Stuart Bingham]]. Recovering from 5\u20137 behind, Bingham won the final 10\u20138 to claim his first Masters title. He became the oldest Masters champion at age&nbsp;43, beating the previous record set by [[Ray Reardon]] in [[1976 Masters (snooker)|1976]].\n\nIn winning the event, Bingham won [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]250,000 from a total prize pool of \u00a3725,000.

{"title_page": "Nehemiah Hayyun", "text_new": "'''Nehemiah Hiyya ben Moses Hayyun''' (ca. 1650 \u2013 ca. 1730) was a [[History of the Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] [[Kabalist]]. His parents, of [[Sephardic]] descent, lived in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] (then a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]), where he was most likely born, though later in life he pretended that he was a [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] emissary born in [[Safed]]. He received his [[Talmudic]] education in [[Hebron]].\n\n==Excommunicated at Jerusalem==\nIn his eighteenth year he became rabbi of [[Skopje|Uskup]], in present-day Republic of North Macedonia (''\u00dcsk\u00fcp'' - {{lang-ota|\u0627\u0633\u0643\u0648\u0628}}). This position, however, he held only for a brief period. Thereafter he led a wandering life, as a merchant, as a scholar, or as a mendicant. In the guise of a saint he constantly sought adventures of love. From Uskup he went to Palestine, then to [[Egypt]]. In 1708 he made his appearance in [[Smyrna]], where he won some adherents willing to help him publish his ''Mehemnuta de Kulla,'' and thus secure a rabbinical position for him. In this work he asserted that [[Judaism]] teaches a Trinitarian God. This God, he declared, embodies three faces (\"par\u1e93ufim\") \u2013 the Ancient of Days (\"'Atti\u1e33\"), the Holy King, and the Shekinah. \u1e24ayyun's own part in this book consists only of two commentaries; the text was anonymously written by a [[Sabbatean]] pupil. Leaving Smyrna, \u1e24ayyun was led to [[Jerusalem]] with pomp and ceremony, but the rabbi of Smyrna, who had seen through his pretensions, warned the rabbis of Jerusalem of his heresies. The immediate consequence was that even before his arrival the rabbis of Jerusalem, though they had never read his work, excommunicated him as a \"min,\" and condemned his book to be burned.\n\n==At Prague==\nExcommunicated, he met little sympathy anywhere (1709-1711). In Venice, however (1711), with the approval of the rabbis of that community, he had printed an extract from his work, under the title ''Raza di-Yi\u1e25udah,'' into the beginning of which he had woven the first stanza of a lascivious Italian love-song, ''La Bella Margaritha,'' with a mystical hymn entitled ''Keter 'Elyon.'' In [[Prague]], where he lived from 1711 until 1712, he found an appropriate soil for his teaching. Joseph Oppenheim, the son of [[David Oppenheim (rabbi)|David Oppenheim]], received him. The Kabbalistic rabbi of Prague, [[Naphtali Cohen]], was also greatly impressed with his personality. He even highly recommended his book, basing his judgment merely upon fraudulent testimonials. Here \u1e24ayyun delivered sermons which had a Shabbethaian background, and which he had printed in Berlin (1713) under the title ''Dibre Ne\u1e25emyah.'' Moreover, he played the role of a [[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]], of one who had intercourse with [[Elijah]], of a person capable of resurrecting the dead and of creating new worlds. By writing amulets he earned the money he needed for gambling. By fraudulent introductions he also managed to obtain friends in [[Vienna]], [[Mikulov|Nikolsburg]], [[Prost\u011bjov|Prossnitz]], [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]], [[G\u0142og\u00f3w|Glogau]], and [[Berlin]], and formed political connections with L\u00f6bel Prossnitz of [[Moravia]]. In Berlin (1713), the community of which city was then split into two parties, he succeeded in having his book ''Mehemnuta de Kulla,'' or ''Oz le-Elohim,'' printed with the approval of the Berlin rabbi, [[Aaron Benjamin Wolf]].\n\n==In Amsterdam==\nOn the prestige he obtained from his book he now tried his fortune in [[Amsterdam]]. Almost from the outset he encountered the antagonism of [[Tzvi Ashkenazi]], rabbi of the German congregation of Amsterdam, who mistook him for another \u1e24ayyun, an old enemy of his. \u1e24ayyun surrendered his book to the board of the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Portuguese congregation]] in Amsterdam, in order to obtain permission to sell it. Distrusting their own rabbi, [[Solomon Ayllon]], this board brought the matter before [[Tzvi Ashkenazi]], who, of course, very soon detected its heretical character and called for its author's expulsion. At this point, however, Ayllon, under the threat of \u1e24ayyun to reveal his past life as a Shabbethaian to the whole of Amsterdam, became his defender, and made \u1e24ayyun's cause entirely his own and that of the Portuguese community. The result was that Ayllon was charged by the board of his synagogue to form a commission to reexamine \u1e24ayyun's book. Without awaiting the decision of this commission, Tzvi Ashkenazi and his anti-Shabbethaian friend [[Moses Hagiz]] excommunicated \u1e24ayyun (July 23, 1713). They published their decision, with various unjustified calumnies, in pamphlets, which, answered by counter pamphlets, greatly increased the ill feeling between the Portuguese and the German congregation.\n\n==Left Amsterdam==\nThe Portuguese commission announced its decision on August 7, 1713. In spite of the objections of two members of the commission, one of them Ayllon's own son, they declared \u1e24ayyun entirely guiltless of heresy, and he was rehabilitated in a solemn assembly of the great Amsterdam synagogue. But \u1e24ayyun was excommunicated by many other outside congregations, and his disreputable antecedents and the deceptive means by which he acquired introductions were exposed, especially by [[Leon Brieli]], the aged rabbi of [[Mantua]]. In spite of this the members of the Portuguese commission adhered to their decision, but felt themselves bound to publicly exonerate themselves, and for this purpose issued ''\u1e32osh\u1e6d Imre Emet,'' a pamphlet which was not without obvious misstatements. Protected by the Portuguese, \u1e24ayyun could even insult his opponents in pamphlets, and did so. He attacked \u1e92ebi Ashkenazi, in ''Ha-\u1e92ad \u1e92ebi,'' Amsterdam, 1713; Joseph Ergas, in ''Shalhebet Yah'' and ''Ketobet \u1e32a'\u1e33a''; \u1e92ebi Ashkenazi, Moses \u1e24agiz, and Leon Brieli, in ''Pit\u1e33a Min Shemaya''; Moses \u1e24agiz, in ''Iggeret Shebu\u1e33in,'' Amsterdam, 1714. At last, however, \u1e24ayyun left for the Orient, and every one felt relieved. The introductions given him by his supporters were of little avail; wherever he went the doors were barred against him.\n\nIn August 1724, through the influence of a vizier, he succeeded at [[Constantinople]] in absolving himself from the excommunication on the condition that he should abstain from teaching, writing, and preaching on cabalistic subjects. Under oath he promised this, but subsequently broke his word. Thus rehabilitated, he went to [[Vienna]] and managed, by urging his Trinitarian teachings and professing his intention to convert the Jews to [[Christianity]], to obtain a letter of protection from the [[Austrian monarchy|Austrian]] emperor, although he secretly sympathized with the [[Shabbethaians]] and still openly professed to be an [[Orthodox Jew]]. But his game had been played. Before the walls of Prague he faced starvation. In Berlin, he threatened to profess Christianity if support were denied him. His friends in Amsterdam, even Ayllon, thus forsook him. In April 1726, he was excommunicated in [[Hamburg]] and finally in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]. He fled to [[North Africa]], where he died. His son turned Christian, and endeavored to revenge his father by allegedly-calumnious attacks on Judaism.\n\n==''Jewish Encyclopedia'' bibliography==\n*[[Johann Christoph Wolf]], ''Bibliotheca Hebr\u00e6a'' iii.828 et seq., iv.928 et seq.;\n*Jost, ''Geschichte des Israelitischen Volkes'', ii.363 et seq., 468 et seq.;\n*\u2014, ''Geschichte des Judenthums und Seiner Sekten'', iii.177 et seq.;\n*D.

The novels are related from the [[first-person narrative|first-person]] perspective by Ellie Linton, a teenage girl, who is part of a small band of teenagers waging a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] war on the enemy soldiers in the region around their fictional home town of Wirrawee. The name of the series is derived from the title of the first book, ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]''.\n\nThe books in the series were originally published from 1993\u201399, by [[Pan Macmillan]] and have been reprinted sixteen times. A sequel series, ''The Ellie Chronicles'', was later published from 2003\u201306. The follow-up series concerns itself largely with the attempts of society and the protagonist to regain a normal level of functioning in the face of the psychological damage sustained during the war.\n\nIn the original series (1993\u201399) the identity of the invading force is never specified, which is most likely by explicit intent of the author. In the sequel series (2003\u201306) the invading force is specified as a coalition of highly populous South Asian nations, who see the vast underdeveloped spaces and natural resources of Australia as a way to tackle their [[human overpopulation]] problem, and the series features multinational colonies of enemy civilians being set up in conquered territory. Few parts of the war outside Ellie's immediate perspective are covered; the reader is not informed exactly how much of the country is under enemy control, though a radio broadcast early in the series confirms that several major costal cities, and much of the inland area has been seized by the invading forces. Furthermore, how well the war is going for the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian military]] is not covered, however, it's strongly inferred that they suffer heavy losses. \n\n''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels are one of the most popular and critically acclaimed series of novels aimed at young readers in Australian literature history.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\">6 August 2008 [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6341932.html Tomorrow Series Relaunched for Today's Readers] Publishersweekly.com</ref> It has sold over 3 million copies in Australia and has been translated into five languages.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\"/><ref name=\"sf\">[http://www.sfsite.com/12b/tom47.htm Bibliographer Researches Australian Children's Books] [http://www.nla.gov.au/ National Library of Australia] {{ISSN|1039-3498}}, no. 58, August 2002</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[The Dead of the Night]]'' (1994)\n* ''The Third Day, the Frost'' (1995) <small> (published in the U.S. and Canada as ''A Killing Frost'')</small>\n* ''Darkness, Be My Friend'' (1996)\n* ''Burning for Revenge'' (1997)\n* ''The Night is for Hunting'' (1998)\n* ''The Other Side of Dawn'' (1999)\n\n==Plot summary==\nEllie goes out camping in [[the bush]] for a week with her friends Homer, Lee, Kevin, Corrie, Robyn, and Fiona. They find a way into a large, vegetated sinkhole in a remote area of bush the locals call \"Hell\", and camp there for the week. During this time they see large numbers of planes flying through the night without lights, and though it is mentioned in conversation the following morning, they think little of it.\n\nWhen they return home they find that all the people are missing and their pets and livestock are dead or dying. They come to realise that Australia has been invaded and their family and friends have been taken prisoner. Avoiding capture by enemy soldiers, as well as retrieving Robyn and Lee who were stuck in the town and picking up one of their school friends Chris, the group return to Hell. After short period of recovery they start making plans to fight back.\n\nOver the course of the first three books in the series, the group succeeds in destroying a bridge that leads into Wirrawee, an enemy convoy, several houses that are being used by the enemy as a center of operations, and a nearby strategic harbour. After the harbour raid, the surviving members of the group are eventually captured and placed in a maximum security prison in Stratton. During an air-raid by the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] the group escapes but loses yet another member while doing so. They encounter a downed RNZAF pilot and arrange to be evacuated to New Zealand.\n\nBook four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend'', takes place several months later. The group is trying to live a normal life in New Zealand with other refugees, but are haunted by their memories of the war (which is still ongoing). They are approached by the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], who are seeking Australian guerrillas to act as guides for saboteur units that are being dropped into occupied Australian territory. The group returns to Wirrawee, their hometown, accompanied by a platoon of New Zealand troops. However the New Zealanders go missing while on a mission to destroy Wirrawee Airfield (which is being used as a major military airbase). Alone behind enemy lines once more, the group decides to attack the Airfield themselves but a combination of poor planning and bad luck causes them to fail. They return, depressed, to Hell.\n\nSoon after, through sheer luck, the group find themselves perfectly positioned to attempt another attack on the Airfield. This time they succeed and manage to destroy a majority of planes on the airfield. After the attack, the group find their way to the nearby city of Stratton. There they encounter a tribe of feral (and hostile) children, who have been living on the streets and hiding from enemy troops since the war began. The group rescue five of the children who have been captured by an enemy patrol and escape back to Hell. For a time the group looks after the children. During this time strained relationships are mended and the soul-destroying effects of the war are tempered by a chance to do something positive. However, this period does not last. A patrol ambushes the group near their base and after defeating their attackers in a prolonged firefight the group realises that they are no longer safe in Hell and make contact with New Zealand immediately.\n\nThey discover that the war is entering its final days and that groups of [[partisan (military)|partisan]]s like themselves are being asked to cause as much chaos behind enemy lines as possible while New Zealand and its allies launch an all-out offensive. The group arranges for the feral children to be evacuated to New Zealand and are provided with [[plastic explosives]] to carry out their task.\n\nThe group attacks a service station frequented by enemy convoys and are separated in the aftermath. Ellie is shot in the leg and taken prisoner. While interned, she discovers the location of her mother and father. She escapes and is reunited with her mother whom she stays with until news breaks that the war is over \u2013 Australia signs a [[peace treaty]] with the occupying power, resulting in the formation of a new nation on the continent for the invading forces and settlers.\n\nIt transpires that Wirrawee is on the Australian side of the border. Ellie, her mother and her father return to their farm and, like all the other survivors of the war, begin picking up the pieces of their lives.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The group===\n;Ellie Linton: The main protagonist and narrator of the series. Ellie was born and raised on a cattle and sheep farm not far from the edge of the country town of Wirrawee. She is loyal to her friends, to her family, she loves the Australian bush and the life on the land. Ellie prides herself on being the strongest member (and therefore one of the leaders) of the group. Nevertheless, she is often scared and uncertain of her actions and tries to hide what she perceives to be these moments of weakness from her friends.\n\n;Corrie Mackenzie: Ellie's best friend since childhood. It was Corrie who first suggested going on a camping trip into Hell. Corrie was shot and mortally wounded at the end of the first book. Corrie's death affects the group deeply, especially Ellie who eventually comes to terms with the loss in book four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend''.\n\n;Homer Yannos: Ellie's neighbour and close friend. Homer is forceful and domineering and has trouble dealing with other strong personalities. Prior to the war Homer appeared to be a wild and irresponsible boy. The war reveals him to be a strong leader. However, on occasions where he is not in control Homer reverts to his immature ways. As the war progresses he gradually relies on Ellie to get the group to safety.\n\n;Fiona Maxwell: Commonly referred to as 'Fi' by the group, she had a sheltered upbringing before the war. Fi was shown early on to be the least physically capable of the group. Despite this Fi manages to find the courage within herself to complete the tasks she has been set, though she rarely takes an active role in planning the group's attacks. Fi becomes Ellie's confidante after Corrie's departure and acts as the most rational member of the group after Robyn. She develops a slow romance with the wild Homer.\n\n;Lee Takkam: Prior to the war Lee was a studious, somewhat lonely boy. During the war Lee demonstrates an aptitude for violence, a tendency to act impulsively and a strong desire for vengeance, especially after finding out his parents were killed. He develops a relationship with Ellie.\n\n;Robyn Mathers: A friend of Ellie and Corrie's with really strong held religious beliefs. Robyn is calm under pressure and is a capable leader. She regards herself as a [[pacifist]] and refuses to participate in any activities where she will be required to directly take a life. Despite this she is convinced that what the group is doing is right and enjoys the adrenaline rush that being in dangerous situations gives her. She eventually is killed in an act of heroism in book three, ''Third Day, The Frost'', where she blows herself up in order to kill Major Harvey once and for all.\n\n;Kevin Holmes: Corrie's boyfriend, Kevin fancies himself a tough guy but is shown to have difficulty handling high pressure situations. Kevin is separated from the group at the end of book one, ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''. When he is reunited with them again near the beginning of book three, ''Third Day, The Frost'', he is shocked to see how brutal the war has made his friends. His knowledge of explosives enables the group to successfully attack the Cobbler's Bay harbor.\n\n;Chris Lang: Prior to the war Chris was an introverted, but well liked boy. Chris was one of the few not taken prisoner when enemy forces seized Wirrawee. The group encounter him soon after returning from Hell and he decides to join with them. Although regarded as a genius by all of his friends, Chris is unable to apply that genius to the group's current situation. As the war wears on he withdraws more and more into his own head, into his world of illicit substances, depression and poetry.\n\n===Others===\n;Major Harvey:A former school deputy principal who was once in the [[Australian Army Reserve|Army Reserve]], Harvey is introduced as the leader of Harvey's Heroes, a group of adult partisans. It is later revealed that Harvey was working with the invaders and that the Harvey's Heroes organisation was established to deliver would-be resistance fighters into the hands of the invaders. As such he plays as a primary antagonist to the group.\n\n;Colonel Finley:An officer of the [[New Zealand Army]]'s [[New Zealand Intelligence Corps|Intelligence Corps]]. Finley supervised the group's recovery and well-being during their time in New Zealand, and later becomes their ''de facto'' commanding officer when the group returned to Wirrawee.\n\n;Gavin: A young deaf boy who was part of a gang of war orphans, led by a dictatorial boy called Aldo, living in Stratton since the war began. Of the children the group rescue, only Gavin had occupied a position amongst Aldo's inner circle. Being used to a position of power, Gavin immediately establishes himself as the leader of the children. He initially doesn't trust Ellie and her friends but soon comes to feel affection and respect for them.\n\n==Themes==\nIn his book ''John Marsden: Darkness, Shadow, and Light'' John Noell Moore, associate professor of English at [[The College of William & Mary]], identifies several significant themes of the series; the transition from innocence to experience; the power of the Australian landscape; understanding the past as a way of dealing with the present and preparing for the future; and writing and storytelling and how they shape identity.<ref name=DarkShadow>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=John Noell|title=John Marsden; Darkness, Shadow and Light|year=2010|publisher=Scarcrow Press|location=Blue Ridge Summit, PA, USA|isbn=9780810877436|pages=199}}</ref>\n\nThe transition from innocence to experience is shown in transformations in Ellie's thinking and her changing notions towards leadership and courage as the series progresses.<ref name=DarkShadow /> Ellie's reasons for chronicling her experiences also develop throughout the series. She starts out recording for the group who don't want to die unnoticed and forgotten and continues writing for herself to better understand her own thoughts and feelings. Later on she writes to recreate the past which has become a lost world to her and preserve the lessons that she has learnt from it.<ref name=DarkShadow /> The Australian bush becomes \"a symbol of stability in a world that seems to be disintegrating\". Its presence gives hope to the characters throughout the series.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\nOther notable themes in the series are the role of family and friendship; sexual maturation and the conflicting worldviews of teenagers and adults.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\n==Inspiration==\nJohn Marsden was inspired to write ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' while watching an [[ANZAC Day]] march.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  A large number of teenagers were in attendance, paying respect to the sacrifices made by the past generations. He wondered how they might react if they were placed in the same position that their grandparents were at their age. He felt that the popular media's view of the average young person as \"illiterate, drug crazed, suicidal, alcoholic, criminal, promiscuous, a dole [[wiktionary:bludger#Noun|bludger]], or all of the above\" was wrong.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}} It seemed to him that like the generations before them modern teenagers would \"dig deep and find reserves of initiative, maturity, responsibility and even heroism\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}}\n\nWith ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels Marsden set out to write an \"old fashioned adventure story\". To do this Marsden looked to the authors he had read most avidly as a teenager, thriller writers such as [[Ian Fleming]], [[Desmond Bagley]], [[John Buchan]], [[Hammond Innes]] and [[Alistair MacLean]]. He sought to emulate their approaches to timing, pacing and building tension and suspense and combine them with \"the new teenage genres, where feelings, relationships and character development were all-important.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Wardle|first=Lisa|title=John Marsden \u2013 Author Interview Series|url=http://lisa-wardle.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/john-marsden-author-interview-series.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Marsden|first=John|title=Write of Passage|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/write-of-passage-20100820-138mu.html#ixzz21ERVL160|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe inspiration for the rural setting of the series was what Marsden saw as the disappearance of the bush tales that he had enjoyed growing up. He had noticed that many novels for young people published in recent decades were about issues arising for families and children living in the suburbs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  In ''Marsden on Marsden'' he writes:\n\n:\"I\u2019ve written some of these novels myself, and I know and appreciate the need for them, but I thought it was a pity that we had gotten so far away from the bush and country novels that were popular in earlier generations, and I quite consciously set out to revive that genre.\"{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}}\n\nMarsden cites the works of Australian Children's Author [[Mary Grant Bruce]] as major influence on the series. In his introduction to the ''John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics'' imprint of Bruce's 1940 novel ''Peter and Co'' Marsden notes the book's similarities to his series. Both are stories about groups of young people battling enemy forces intent on the invasion of Australia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant Bruce|first=Mary|title=Peter and Co (John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics)|year=2001|publisher=Pan Australia}}</ref> Marsden states that while he didn't intentionally set out to emulate ''Peter and Co'' when he wrote ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' he does see many of his memories of the novel reflected in his work.\n\nEllie, the Tomorrow series central protagonist was modelled after the \"courageous and resourceful\" farm girl Norah from Mary Grant Bruce's Billabong series of novels.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}} The series follows the fortunes of the Linton family, the owners of a large cattle station in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], during first half of the 20th century. In the Tomorrow Series it is implied that Ellie is the great-granddaughter of Norah's brother Jim.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=100}} The character was also inspired by Charlotte Austin, a student who Marsden had taught and admired for her resourcefulness, honesty and \"gutsy approach to life\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=73}}\n\nThe character of Homer was based on a number of students from rural backgrounds that Marsden had taught. He noticed that many of these students, who at home drove cars, ploughed fields, harvested crops, worked as shearers and more, had trouble adjusting to an environment where they \"were not trusted to change a light globe or put a Band-Aid on a cut\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=76}} These students became frustrated and angry and their immature behaviour was the result.\n\nRobyn was modelled after Marsden's own sister, a deeply committed Christian. Marsden was inspired to write the character when he noticed that while many teenagers identified themselves as Christians this group was not represented at all in fiction written for them.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  Chris was an approximation of Marsden himself as a teen. Though unlike Chris, Marsden never used drugs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}\n\nWhen asked why young people related to the characters in his books, Ellie in particular, Marsden speculated that, like himself, they found their strength and self-reliance inspirational.<ref name=RollerC>{{cite web|title=''Interviews, John Marsden'' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rollercoaster/therap/interviews/s1532838.htm|work=Rollercoaster|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> In an interview with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Rollercoaster website he explained what inspired him to highlight these virtues in his work:\n\n:\"I've always been attracted to strong people in real life and in fiction. As a kid I read a lot of books like ''[[The Naked Island (book)|The Naked Island]]'' about [[Russell Braddon]] and his experiences on the [[Burma-Thai railway|Burma-Thai Railway]] and ''[[The Cattle King]]'', which is the biography of [[Sidney Kidman]], and they had a profound impact on me and I read those books many times. So I think the idea of people overcoming adversity by using their own resources was strongly imprinted in me by those books, because those guys had nothing except their own strength and their own mind power. There's something noble about that.\"<ref name=RollerC />\n\n==Similarities to other John Marsden novels==\n* In Marsden's 1988 novel ''The Journey'' the main character finds a hut belonging to a dead hermit. A similar sequence occurs in ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''.\n* In ''Out of Time'' (1990) the protagonist's country, implied to be Australia, is at war with an unspecified enemy. The protagonist has a sister called Ellie.\n* An Australia type nation is invaded in John Marsden and [[Shaun Tan|Shaun Tan's]] picture book ''The Rabbits'' (1998)\n* ''Home and Away'' (2008), a picture book by John Marsden and Matt Ottley, tells the story of a family fleeing from a war-torn Australia. Their story is similar to the story of how Lee's mother came to Australia as a refugee.\n\n==Reception==\nUpon publication, the series was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Critics praised the series for its insightful look at a wide range of issues and suspense filled narrative.

(2003), ''Incurable'' (2005), and ''Circle of Flight'' (2006). The three books detail Ellie's struggles in post-war life in Wirrawee. Ellie finds herself running the family farm after the murder of her parents, and dealing with Gavin, the deaf boy she rescued during the war. Shortly after the death of her parents, Ellie faces bankruptcy and turns to Homer's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Yannos, for help. In addition, a group called \"Liberation\", headed by the mysterious \"Scarlet Pimple\" (a play of words on \"[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]\"), are conducting secret border raids against the new nation.\n\n==Adaptations==\n===Film===\n{{Main|Tomorrow, When the War Began (film)}}\nIn June 2009, [[Screen Australia]] announced that it would fund the development of the feature film ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'', written and directed by screenwriter [[Stuart Beattie]] (''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]], [[Collateral (film)|Collateral]], [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''), and produced by Andrew Mason for Ambience Entertainment, reportedly to begin production in late 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=840471|title=John Marsden book to be made into film|work=[[Nine News]]|date=22 July 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912012709/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=840471|archivedate=12 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iecfa450e38f03b772d4e458e999c8f5c |title=Stuart Beattie looks to 'Tomorrow' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=28 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619081417/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iecfa450e38f03b772d4e458e999c8f5c |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}</ref><ref name=screenaustralia>{{Cite news|url=http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2009/mr_090616_approvals.asp|title=Screen Australia announces funding for five features including ''Wog Boy 2: Kings of Mykonos'' and ''Tomorrow When the War Began''|work=[[Screen Australia]]|date=16 June 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028193357/http://screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2009/mr_090616_approvals.asp|archivedate=28 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Raymond Terrace]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of [[New South Wales]], was chosen as a major location for producing the film.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au/news/local/news/general/terrace-on-centre-stage/1618590.aspx|title=Terrace on centre stage|work=Port Stephens Examiner|date=9 September 2009|accessdate=16 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013115504/http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au/news/local/news/general/terrace-on-centre-stage/1618590.aspx|archive-date=13 October 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The film was released in Australian cinemas on 2 September 2010.

The novels are related from the [[first-person narrative|first-person]] perspective by Ellie Linton, a teenage girl, who is part of a small band of teenagers waging a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] war on the enemy soldiers in the region around their fictional home town of Wirrawee. The name of the series is derived from the title of the first book, ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]''.\n\nThe books in the series were originally published from 1993\u201399, by [[Pan Macmillan]] and have been reprinted sixteen times. A sequel series, ''The Ellie Chronicles'', was later published from 2003\u201306. The follow-up series concerns itself largely with the attempts of society and the protagonist to regain a normal level of functioning in the face of the psychological damage sustained during the war.\n\nIn the original series (1993\u201399) the identity of the invading force is never specified, which is most likely by explicit intent of the author. In the sequel series (2003\u201306) the invading force is specified as a coalition of highly populous South Asian nations, who see the vast underdeveloped spaces and natural resources of Australia as a way to tackle their [[human overpopulation]] problem, and the series features multinational colonies of enemy civilians being set up in conquered territory. Few parts of the war outside Ellie's immediate perspective are covered; the reader is not informed exactly how much of the country is under enemy control, though a radio broadcast early in the series confirms that several major costal cities, and much of the inland area has been seized by the invading forces. Furthermore, how well the war is going for the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian military]] is not covered, however, it's strongly inferred that they suffer heavy losses. \n\n''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels are one of the most popular and critically acclaimed series of novels aimed at young readers in Australian literature history.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\">6 August 2008 [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6341932.html Tomorrow Series Relaunched for Today's Readers] Publishersweekly.com</ref> It has sold over 3 million copies in Australia and has been translated into five languages.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\"/><ref name=\"sf\">[http://www.sfsite.com/12b/tom47.htm Bibliographer Researches Australian Children's Books] [http://www.nla.gov.au/ National Library of Australia] {{ISSN|1039-3498}}, no. 58, August 2002</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[The Dead of the Night]]'' (1994)\n* ''The Third Day, the Frost'' (1995) <small> (published in the U.S. and Canada as ''A Killing Frost'')</small>\n* ''Darkness, Be My Friend'' (1996)\n* ''Burning for Revenge'' (1997)\n* ''The Night is for Hunting'' (1998)\n* ''The Other Side of Dawn'' (1999)\n\n==Plot summary==\nEllie goes out camping in [[the bush]] for a week with her friends Homer, Lee, Kevin, Corrie, Robyn, and Fiona. They find a way into a large, vegetated sinkhole in a remote area of bush the locals call \"Hell\", and camp there for the week. During this time they see large numbers of planes flying through the night without lights, and though it is mentioned in conversation the following morning, they think little of it.\n\nWhen they return home they find that all the people are missing and their pets and livestock are dead or dying. They come to realise that Australia has been invaded and their family and friends have been taken prisoner. Avoiding capture by enemy soldiers, as well as retrieving Robyn and Lee who were stuck in the town and picking up one of their school friends Chris, the group return to Hell. After short period of recovery they start making plans to fight back.\n\nOver the course of the first three books in the series, the group succeeds in destroying a bridge that leads into Wirrawee, an enemy convoy, several houses that are being used by the enemy as a center of operations, and a nearby strategic harbour. After the harbour raid, the surviving members of the group are eventually captured and placed in a maximum security prison in Stratton. During an air-raid by the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] the group escapes but loses yet another member while doing so. They encounter a downed RNZAF pilot and arrange to be evacuated to New Zealand.\n\nBook four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend'', takes place several months later. The group is trying to live a normal life in New Zealand with other refugees, but are haunted by their memories of the war (which is still ongoing). They are approached by the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], who are seeking Australian guerrillas to act as guides for saboteur units that are being dropped into occupied Australian territory. The group returns to Wirrawee, their hometown, accompanied by a platoon of New Zealand troops. However the New Zealanders go missing while on a mission to destroy Wirrawee Airfield (which is being used as a major military airbase). Alone behind enemy lines once more, the group decides to attack the Airfield themselves but a combination of poor planning and bad luck causes them to fail. They return, depressed, to Hell.\n\nSoon after, through sheer luck, the group find themselves perfectly positioned to attempt another attack on the Airfield. This time they succeed and manage to destroy a majority of planes on the airfield. After the attack, the group find their way to the nearby city of Stratton. There they encounter a tribe of feral (and hostile) children, who have been living on the streets and hiding from enemy troops since the war began. The group rescue five of the children who have been captured by an enemy patrol and escape back to Hell. For a time the group looks after the children. During this time strained relationships are mended and the soul-destroying effects of the war are tempered by a chance to do something positive. However, this period does not last. A patrol ambushes the group near their base and after defeating their attackers in a prolonged firefight the group realises that they are no longer safe in Hell and make contact with New Zealand immediately.\n\nThey discover that the war is entering its final days and that groups of [[partisan (military)|partisan]]s like themselves are being asked to cause as much chaos behind enemy lines as possible while New Zealand and its allies launch an all-out offensive. The group arranges for the feral children to be evacuated to New Zealand and are provided with [[plastic explosives]] to carry out their task.\n\nThe group attacks a service station frequented by enemy convoys and are separated in the aftermath. Ellie is shot in the leg and taken prisoner. While interned, she discovers the location of her mother and father. She escapes and is reunited with her mother whom she stays with until news breaks that the war is over \u2013 Australia signs a [[peace treaty]] with the occupying power, resulting in the formation of a new nation on the continent for the invading forces and settlers.\n\nIt transpires that Wirrawee is on the Australian side of the border. Ellie, her mother and her father return to their farm and, like all the other survivors of the war, begin picking up the pieces of their lives.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The group===\n;Ellie Linton: The main protagonist and narrator of the series. Ellie was born and raised on a cattle and sheep farm not far from the edge of the country town of Wirrawee. She is loyal to her friends, to her family, she loves the Australian bush and the life on the land. Ellie prides herself on being the strongest member (and therefore one of the leaders) of the group. Nevertheless, she is often scared and uncertain of her actions and tries to hide what she perceives to be these moments of weakness from her friends.\n\n;Corrie Mackenzie: Ellie's best friend since childhood. It was Corrie who first suggested going on a camping trip into Hell. Corrie was shot and mortally wounded at the end of the first book. Corrie's death affects the group deeply, especially Ellie who eventually comes to terms with the loss in book four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend''.\n\n;Homer Yannos: Ellie's neighbour and close friend. Homer is forceful and domineering and has trouble dealing with other strong personalities. Prior to the war Homer appeared to be a wild and irresponsible boy. The war reveals him to be a strong leader. However, on occasions where he is not in control Homer reverts to his immature ways. As the war progresses he gradually relies on Ellie to get the group to safety.\n\n;Fiona Maxwell: Commonly referred to as 'Fi' by the group, she had a sheltered upbringing before the war. Fi was shown early on to be the least physically capable of the group. Despite this Fi manages to find the courage within herself to complete the tasks she has been set, though she rarely takes an active role in planning the group's attacks. Fi becomes Ellie's confidante after Corrie's departure and acts as the most rational member of the group after Robyn. She develops a slow romance with the wild Homer.\n\n;Lee Takkam: Prior to the war Lee was a studious, somewhat lonely boy. During the war Lee demonstrates an aptitude for violence, a tendency to act impulsively and a strong desire for vengeance, especially after finding out his parents were killed. He develops a relationship with Ellie.\n\n;Robyn Mathers: A friend of Ellie and Corrie's with really strong held religious beliefs. Robyn is calm under pressure and is a capable leader. She regards herself as a [[pacifist]] and refuses to participate in any activities where she will be required to directly take a life. Despite this she is convinced that what the group is doing is right and enjoys the adrenaline rush that being in dangerous situations gives her. She eventually is killed in an act of heroism in book three, \"The Third Day, The Frost\", where she blows herself up in order to kill Major Harvey once and for all.\n\n;Kevin Holmes: Corrie's boyfriend, Kevin fancies himself a tough guy but is shown to have difficulty handling high pressure situations. Kevin is separated from the group at the end of book one, ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''. When he is reunited with them again near the beginning of book three, ''Third Day, The Frost'', he is shocked to see how brutal the war has made his friends. His knowledge of explosives enables the group to successfully attack the Cobbler's Bay harbor.\n\n;Chris Lang: Prior to the war Chris was an introverted, but well liked boy. Chris was one of the few not taken prisoner when enemy forces seized Wirrawee. The group encounter him soon after returning from Hell and he decides to join with them. Although regarded as a genius by all of his friends, Chris is unable to apply that genius to the group's current situation. As the war wears on he withdraws more and more into his own head, into his world of illicit substances, depression and poetry.\n\n===Others===\n;Major Harvey:A former school deputy principal who was once in the [[Australian Army Reserve|Army Reserve]], Harvey is introduced as the leader of Harvey's Heroes, a group of adult partisans. It is later revealed that Harvey was working with the invaders and that the Harvey's Heroes organisation was established to deliver would-be resistance fighters into the hands of the invaders. As such he plays as a primary antagonist to the group.\n\n;Colonel Finley:An officer of the [[New Zealand Army]]'s [[New Zealand Intelligence Corps|Intelligence Corps]]. Finley supervised the group's recovery and well-being during their time in New Zealand, and later becomes their ''de facto'' commanding officer when the group returned to Wirrawee.\n\n;Gavin: A young deaf boy who was part of a gang of war orphans, led by a dictatorial boy called Aldo, living in Stratton since the war began. Of the children the group rescue, only Gavin had occupied a position amongst Aldo's inner circle. Being used to a position of power, Gavin immediately establishes himself as the leader of the children. He initially doesn't trust Ellie and her friends but soon comes to feel affection and respect for them.\n\n==Themes==\nIn his book ''John Marsden: Darkness, Shadow, and Light'' John Noell Moore, associate professor of English at [[The College of William & Mary]], identifies several significant themes of the series; the transition from innocence to experience; the power of the Australian landscape; understanding the past as a way of dealing with the present and preparing for the future; and writing and storytelling and how they shape identity.<ref name=DarkShadow>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=John Noell|title=John Marsden; Darkness, Shadow and Light|year=2010|publisher=Scarcrow Press|location=Blue Ridge Summit, PA, USA|isbn=9780810877436|pages=199}}</ref>\n\nThe transition from innocence to experience is shown in transformations in Ellie's thinking and her changing notions towards leadership and courage as the series progresses.<ref name=DarkShadow /> Ellie's reasons for chronicling her experiences also develop throughout the series. She starts out recording for the group who don't want to die unnoticed and forgotten and continues writing for herself to better understand her own thoughts and feelings. Later on she writes to recreate the past which has become a lost world to her and preserve the lessons that she has learnt from it.<ref name=DarkShadow /> The Australian bush becomes \"a symbol of stability in a world that seems to be disintegrating\". Its presence gives hope to the characters throughout the series.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\nOther notable themes in the series are the role of family and friendship; sexual maturation and the conflicting worldviews of teenagers and adults.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\n==Inspiration==\nJohn Marsden was inspired to write ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' while watching an [[ANZAC Day]] march.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  A large number of teenagers were in attendance, paying respect to the sacrifices made by the past generations. He wondered how they might react if they were placed in the same position that their grandparents were at their age. He felt that the popular media's view of the average young person as \"illiterate, drug crazed, suicidal, alcoholic, criminal, promiscuous, a dole [[wiktionary:bludger#Noun|bludger]], or all of the above\" was wrong.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}} It seemed to him that like the generations before them modern teenagers would \"dig deep and find reserves of initiative, maturity, responsibility and even heroism\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}}\n\nWith ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels Marsden set out to write an \"old fashioned adventure story\". To do this Marsden looked to the authors he had read most avidly as a teenager, thriller writers such as [[Ian Fleming]], [[Desmond Bagley]], [[John Buchan]], [[Hammond Innes]] and [[Alistair MacLean]]. He sought to emulate their approaches to timing, pacing and building tension and suspense and combine them with \"the new teenage genres, where feelings, relationships and character development were all-important.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Wardle|first=Lisa|title=John Marsden \u2013 Author Interview Series|url=http://lisa-wardle.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/john-marsden-author-interview-series.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Marsden|first=John|title=Write of Passage|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/write-of-passage-20100820-138mu.html#ixzz21ERVL160|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe inspiration for the rural setting of the series was what Marsden saw as the disappearance of the bush tales that he had enjoyed growing up. He had noticed that many novels for young people published in recent decades were about issues arising for families and children living in the suburbs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  In ''Marsden on Marsden'' he writes:\n\n:\"I\u2019ve written some of these novels myself, and I know and appreciate the need for them, but I thought it was a pity that we had gotten so far away from the bush and country novels that were popular in earlier generations, and I quite consciously set out to revive that genre.\"{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}}\n\nMarsden cites the works of Australian Children's Author [[Mary Grant Bruce]] as major influence on the series. In his introduction to the ''John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics'' imprint of Bruce's 1940 novel ''Peter and Co'' Marsden notes the book's similarities to his series. Both are stories about groups of young people battling enemy forces intent on the invasion of Australia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant Bruce|first=Mary|title=Peter and Co (John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics)|year=2001|publisher=Pan Australia}}</ref> Marsden states that while he didn't intentionally set out to emulate ''Peter and Co'' when he wrote ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' he does see many of his memories of the novel reflected in his work.\n\nEllie, the Tomorrow series central protagonist was modelled after the \"courageous and resourceful\" farm girl Norah from Mary Grant Bruce's Billabong series of novels.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}} The series follows the fortunes of the Linton family, the owners of a large cattle station in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], during first half of the 20th century. In the Tomorrow Series it is implied that Ellie is the great-granddaughter of Norah's brother Jim.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=100}} The character was also inspired by Charlotte Austin, a student who Marsden had taught and admired for her resourcefulness, honesty and \"gutsy approach to life\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=73}}\n\nThe character of Homer was based on a number of students from rural backgrounds that Marsden had taught. He noticed that many of these students, who at home drove cars, ploughed fields, harvested crops, worked as shearers and more, had trouble adjusting to an environment where they \"were not trusted to change a light globe or put a Band-Aid on a cut\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=76}} These students became frustrated and angry and their immature behaviour was the result.\n\nRobyn was modelled after Marsden's own sister, a deeply committed Christian. Marsden was inspired to write the character when he noticed that while many teenagers identified themselves as Christians this group was not represented at all in fiction written for them.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  Chris was an approximation of Marsden himself as a teen. Though unlike Chris, Marsden never used drugs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}\n\nWhen asked why young people related to the characters in his books, Ellie in particular, Marsden speculated that, like himself, they found their strength and self-reliance inspirational.<ref name=RollerC>{{cite web|title=''Interviews, John Marsden'' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rollercoaster/therap/interviews/s1532838.htm|work=Rollercoaster|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> In an interview with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Rollercoaster website he explained what inspired him to highlight these virtues in his work:\n\n:\"I've always been attracted to strong people in real life and in fiction. As a kid I read a lot of books like ''[[The Naked Island (book)|The Naked Island]]'' about [[Russell Braddon]] and his experiences on the [[Burma-Thai railway|Burma-Thai Railway]] and ''[[The Cattle King]]'', which is the biography of [[Sidney Kidman]], and they had a profound impact on me and I read those books many times. So I think the idea of people overcoming adversity by using their own resources was strongly imprinted in me by those books, because those guys had nothing except their own strength and their own mind power. There's something noble about that.\"<ref name=RollerC />\n\n==Similarities to other John Marsden novels==\n* In Marsden's 1988 novel ''The Journey'' the main character finds a hut belonging to a dead hermit. A similar sequence occurs in ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''.\n* In ''Out of Time'' (1990) the protagonist's country, implied to be Australia, is at war with an unspecified enemy. The protagonist has a sister called Ellie.\n* An Australia type nation is invaded in John Marsden and [[Shaun Tan|Shaun Tan's]] picture book ''The Rabbits'' (1998)\n* ''Home and Away'' (2008), a picture book by John Marsden and Matt Ottley, tells the story of a family fleeing from a war-torn Australia. Their story is similar to the story of how Lee's mother came to Australia as a refugee.\n\n==Reception==\nUpon publication, the series was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Critics praised the series for its insightful look at a wide range of issues and suspense filled narrative. ''[[The Age]]'' proclaimed the series \"the best series for Australian teens of all time...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tomorrow-series.eu/en/books/07-the-other-side-of-dawn|title=The Tomorrow Series \u2013 Your source for everything about John Marsden's series, Tomorrow, When the War Began and the upcoming Tomorrow movies.

(2003), ''Incurable'' (2005), and ''Circle of Flight'' (2006). The three books detail Ellie's struggles in post-war life in Wirrawee. Ellie finds herself running the family farm after the murder of her parents, and dealing with Gavin, the deaf boy she rescued during the war. Shortly after the death of her parents, Ellie faces bankruptcy and turns to Homer's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Yannos, for help. In addition, a group called \"Liberation\", headed by the mysterious \"Scarlet Pimple\" (a play of words on \"[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]\"), are conducting secret border raids against the new nation.\n\n==Adaptations==\n===Film===\n{{Main|Tomorrow, When the War Began (film)}}\nIn June 2009, [[Screen Australia]] announced that it would fund the development of the feature film ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'', written and directed by screenwriter [[Stuart Beattie]] (''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]], [[Collateral (film)|Collateral]], [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''), and produced by Andrew Mason for Ambience Entertainment, reportedly to begin production in late 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=840471|title=John Marsden book to be made into film|work=[[Nine News]]|date=22 July 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912012709/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=840471|archivedate=12 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iecfa450e38f03b772d4e458e999c8f5c |title=Stuart Beattie looks to 'Tomorrow' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=28 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619081417/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iecfa450e38f03b772d4e458e999c8f5c |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}</ref><ref name=screenaustralia>{{Cite news|url=http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2009/mr_090616_approvals.asp|title=Screen Australia announces funding for five features including ''Wog Boy 2: Kings of Mykonos'' and ''Tomorrow When the War Began''|work=[[Screen Australia]]|date=16 June 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028193357/http://screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2009/mr_090616_approvals.asp|archivedate=28 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Raymond Terrace]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of [[New South Wales]], was chosen as a major location for producing the film.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au/news/local/news/general/terrace-on-centre-stage/1618590.aspx|title=Terrace on centre stage|work=Port Stephens Examiner|date=9 September 2009|accessdate=16 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013115504/http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au/news/local/news/general/terrace-on-centre-stage/1618590.aspx|archive-date=13 October 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The film was released in Australian cinemas on 2 September 2010.

During his career in ''lucha libre'' he formed a long running, successful trio known as ''[[Los Espantos]]'' (\"The Terrors\") with his brother Jos\u00e9 Eusebio V\u00e1zquez Bernal (known as [[Espanto I]]) and Fernando Cisneros Carrillo ([[Espanto II]]).\n\n''Los Espantos'' was one of the first examples of an identical trio, where all three members of the team used the same name, mask and wrestling gear only distinguished by a number.

The storyline came to a conclusion on June 12, 1964 where Espanto III was unmasked after losing a ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match to Ram\u00edrez.

At the time of his death, ''Los Espantos'' were set to do a world tour with dates planned for Germany, France, Spain and Japan. The promoters offered Espanto II the opportunity to go alone or with Espanto III, but he declined due to the loss of his close friend. After the death of his brother, Miguel wrestled less regularly and by the early 1970s both Miguel and Cisneros became semi-retired from wrestling, working only a limited schedule in Northern Mexico. As Espanto II and III, the duo held the Northern Tag Team Championship at one point in the 1970s before Espanto II retired in 1979.<ref name=\"FigurasEspanto\"/> At one point during the 1970s Espanto III lost a ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match to La Sombra,{{efn|name=Sombra|Not the same wrestler as the most recent [[La Sombra (wrestler)|La Sombra]].}} marking the first time he lost his hair after losing a ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match.<ref name=\"EncyEspantos\"/> In 1984 he lost another ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match to Black Charly.

The promoters offered Espanto II the opportunity to go alone or with Espanto III, but he declined due to the loss of his close friend.

The presidency of [[Jimmy Carter]] led to a right-wing shift in the Democratic Party. From [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to Richard Nixon, there was a bipartisan support for maintaining social liberal programs created as part of FDR's [[New Deal]]. The Carter administration was the first to begin deregulating and neo-liberalizing the United States economic system.\n\nIn 1985, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]], a faction within the party, was created after the landslide victory of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Ronald Reagan]] over Democrat [[Walter Mondale]] at the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 presidential election]].\n\nDuring the [[1992 United States presidential election]], Bill Clinton and Al Gore, both members of the Democratic Leadership Council, each ran as a [[New Democrats|New Democrat]], running as a Democrat for more limited government. On social issues, Clinton signed the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994]]. On LGBT rights, although coming out strongly in 1993 for open military service for LGBT Americans, Clinton settled on the compromise [[Don't ask, don't tell]] policy (signed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] into law) and signed [[Executive Order 12968]] and [[Executive Order 13087|13087]].\n\nThe [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries and caucuses]] was largely a three-way fight between [[John Kerry]], member of the [[New Democrat Coalition]], [[John Edwards]] (also a member of the New Democrat Coalition) and [[Howard Dean]], founder of [[Democracy for America]].\n\nMost neoliberal Democrats in Congress are members of the New Democrat Coalition, although the [[Blue Dog Coalition]] does include some [[Democratic Leadership Council]] members. There is considerable overlap in the membership of the New Democrats and Blue Dogs, with most of the Blue Dogs holding simultaneous membership and leadership positions with the New Democrats.\n\n===Conservative wing===\n{{main|Conservative Democrat}}\n{{See also|Democrats for Life of America}}\n{{See also|Blue Dog Coalition}}\n[[File:Senator Manchin.jpg|thumb|150px|[[United States Senator]] [[Joe Manchin]]]]\n\nFrom the 1860s to the 1940s, conservative Democrats came to mean opposition to the Radical Republicans who wanted to grant full citizenship rights to freed slaves and take political power away from the ex-Confederates. In the 1940s, the Democratic Party began to advocate against [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].\n\nThe [[conservative coalition]] was an unofficial coalition in the [[United States Congress]] bringing together a conservative majority of the Republican Party and the conservative, mostly [[Southern Democrats|Southern]] wing of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. It was dominant in Congress from 1937 to 1963 and remained a political force until the mid-1980s, eventually dying out in the 1990s. In terms of Congressional roll call votes, it primarily appeared on votes affecting labor unions. The conservative coalition did not operate on civil rights bills, for the two wings had opposing viewpoints.<ref>Katznelson, 1993</ref> However, the coalition did have the power to prevent unwanted bills from even coming to a vote. The coalition included many committee chairmen from the South who blocked bills by not reporting them from their committees. Furthermore, [[Howard W. Smith]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Rules|House Rules Committee]], often could kill a bill simply by not reporting it out with a favorable rule and he lost some of that power in 1961.<ref>Bruce J. Dierenfield, ''Keeper of the Rules: Congressman Howard W. Smith of Virginia'' (1987)</ref> The conservative coalition was not concerned with foreign policy as most of the [[Southern Democrats]] were internationalists, a position opposed by most [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].\n\nToday, conservative Democrats are generally regarded as members of the Democratic Party who are more conservative than the national political party as a whole. Today's conservative Democrats vary greatly in ideology. Some are [[fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] yet [[cultural liberalism|socially liberal]], somewhat akin to the now rare [[Moderate Republicans]], whereas others have a more [[communitarian]] ideology{{snd}}that is, socially moderate but in favor of qualified economic intervention {{snd}}reminiscent of [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] in Europe and Latin America. On foreign policy, conservative Democrats are generally [[liberal interventionism|liberal internationalists]]. Conservative Democrats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] are usually members of the [[Blue Dog Coalition]], although there is some overlap with the New Democrats. The Blue Dog Coalition prioritizes pragmatic and commonsense solutions to critical issues, \"pursuing fiscal responsibility, ensuring a strong national defense, and transcending party lines to get things done for the American people.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://bluedogcaucus-costa.house.gov/ |title=Blue Dog Coalition}}</ref>\n\n===Libertarian wing===\n{{main|Libertarian Democrat}}\n[[File:Mike Gravel.png|thumb|150px|[[United States Senator]] [[Mike Gravel]]]]\n\n[[Civil liberties]] advocates and people against [[National debt of the United States|national debt]] also often support the Democratic Party because its positions on such issues as [[civil rights]] and [[separation of church and state]] are more closely aligned to their own than the positions of the Republican Party and because the Democrats' economic agenda may be more appealing to them than that of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Polis |first=Jared |url=http://reason.com/archives/2014/10/30/vote-democrat-for-real-libertarian-value |title=Vote Democratic for Real Libertarian Values |magazine=Reason Magazine |date=October 30, 2014 |accessdate=June 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nCivil libertarians oppose [[gun control]], the \"[[Prohibition (drugs)|War on Drugs]]\", [[protectionism]], [[corporate welfare]], [[Government debt|governmental borrowing]] and an [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy.

From 1900 to 1920, liberals called themselves progressives and rallied behind Democrats such as [[William Jennings Bryan]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] to fight corruption, waste and big trusts. The Wilson administration saw the enactment of the [[the New Freedom|New Freedom]], progressive social programs enacted from 1913 to 1916, when the Democrats controlled Congress. The rise of the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movement saw the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and a push for civil rights legislation on the basis of gender. The first modern self-described liberal Democratic President was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who enacted the [[New Deal]], a series of [[social liberal]] programs enacted in the United States between 1933 and 1938 and a few that came later. From the 1940s onwards, liberal Democrats began pushing for [[desegregation]] and civil rights legislation for racial minorities. Starting in the 1960s, liberal Democrats began pushing for [[immigration reform]] and [[gun control]]. During the [[Cold War]], the liberal Democratic movement became [[anti-communist]].\n\nIn the 1970s, liberal Democrats began pushing for civil rights for disabled people, consumer protection, environmentalism, LGBT rights, reproductive rights and the end to capital punishment. The election of President Jimmy Carter in 1976 marked the end of the bipartisan support from presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt to [[Richard Nixon]] to the New Deal programs and marked the beginning of support among presidents for more [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies. The key legislative achievement of the Obama administration, the passage and enactment of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (Obamacare), was generally supported among liberal Democrats, but criticized by some for not going far enough. On [[social progressivism]], liberal Democrats achieved expansion of LGBT rights, federal hate crime laws, rescinding the [[Mexico City Policy]], later reinstituted by President [[Donald Trump]], rescinding the ban on federal taxpayer dollars to fund research on [[embryonic stem cells]], [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] and the [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw]]. In the 2010s, Democratic liberals began pushing for the [[legalization of cannabis]], succeeding in several states. President [[Barack Obama]], who opposed cannabis legalization despite being a former smoker himself, did not crack down on states that did legalize cannabis during his presidency.\n\nToday, liberal Democrats are generally regarded as being socially progressive. On economic issues, liberal Democrats vary, with some supporting neoliberal economics while others support [[Keynesian economics]] or a mixed economic system.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} On foreign policy, there is also a divide among liberal Democrats, with some being [[Liberal internationalism|liberal internationalists]] while other are less in favor of interventionism.\n\nThe presidency of Obama was comparatively further to the left than [[Bill Clinton]]'s. In 2011, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]], which supported more centrist and [[Third Way]] positions, was dissolved. Obama has opposed tax reform, the [[Keystone XL Pipeline]] and signed Obamacare into law. The candidacy of Hillary Clinton in 2016 continued this trend, as Secretary Clinton eschewed her husband's \"New Covenant\" centrism and fiscal moderation for liberal policies such as rolling back mandatory minimum sentencing laws, a debt-free college tuition plan for public university students and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/07/26/bill-clinton-democratic-convention/87542864/|title=Party of Clinton looks different than in 1992|first=Heidi|last=Przybyla|newspaper=USA Today}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/|title=Hillary Clinton Was Liberal.

The Asian American population had been a stronghold of the Republican Party until the [[United States presidential election]] of 1992 in which [[George H. W. Bush]] won 55% of the Asian American vote, compared to [[Bill Clinton]] winning 31% and [[Ross Perot]] winning 15% of the Asian vote. Originally, the vast majority of Asian Americans consisted of strongly anti-communist, pro-democracy [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese refugees]], Chinese Americans, [[Taiwanese Americans]], [[Korean Americans]] and socially conservative [[Filipino American|Filipinos]] who fled [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in the 1960s through the 1980s. The Republican Party's socially conservative, fervently anti-communist position strongly resonated with this original demographic. The Democratic Party made gains among the Asian American population starting in 1996 and in 2006 won 62% of the Asian American vote. Exit polls after the 2008 presidential election indicated that Democratic candidate [[Barack Obama]] had won 62% of the Asian American vote nationwide.<ref>\"[http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1209/racial-ethnic-voters-presidential-election?src=prc-latest&proj=peoplepress Dissecting the 2008 Electorate: Most Diverse in U.S. History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618075224/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1209/racial-ethnic-voters-presidential-election?src=prc-latest&proj=peoplepress |date=2012-06-18 }}\".

In 1971, the [[Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club|Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club of San Francisco]] was formed as the first registered [[political action committee]] for LGBT Democrats in the nation. The [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] saw the first speaking slots for LGBT people at a Democratic National Convention, along with votes and rejecting LGBT rights plank to the Democratic Party platform. The presidency of [[Jimmy Carter]] was the first to address LGBT rights, but he did very little to address LGBT rights as President. In the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1980|1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], in response to Carter not doing enough for LGBT rights and not supporting an LGBT plank in the Democratic Party, [[Ted Kennedy]] courted to LGBT voters, supporting adding an LGBT plank to the Democratic Party. LGBT voters voted for Kennedy during the primary, helping him win the California primary and lead to the first LGBT plank to the Democratic Party. During the [[1988 United States presidential election]], [[Michael Dukakis]] was overtly homophobic, leading to many LGBT voters to boo him during a meeting Dukakis had with LGBT groups. Polling showed that [[George H. W. Bush]] won 35\u201340% of the LGBT vote during the 1988 presidential election.\n\nBoth presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] heavily targeted LGBT voters. Exit polling going back to 1990 to the present show that LGBT voters overwhelming prefer the Democratic Party over the Republican Party. On average, about 72.5% of LGBT voters voted Democratic in exit polling for the presidential elections dating from 1992 to the present. On average, about 74.42% of LGBT voters voted Democratic in exit polling for House of Representatives elections dating from 1990 to the present. In the 2012 election exit polls, Obama won 76% of LGBT voters. In the 2016 election polls, [[Hillary Clinton]] won 78% of LGBT voters.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\"\n|+style=\"font-size:100%\"|National polling of the 2008 Democratic presidential

The 2008 national Democratic Party platform for the first time included \"gender identity\" in the party platform, the first explicit inclusion of transgender people in the national Democratic Party platform.

In 2010, President Obama became the first president to appoint an openly transgender person to political positions in the United States federal government.

The working class is largely distinguished by highly routinized and closely supervised work. It consists mainly of [[Clerk (position)#United States|clerical]] and [[blue-collar worker]]s.<ref name=\"The American Class Structure\"/> Even though most in the working class are able to afford an adequate [[standard of living]], high economic insecurity and possible personal benefit from an extended [[social safety net]] make the majority of working-class people left-of-center on economic issues. However, most working class Democrats differ from most liberals in their more socially conservative views. Working class Democrats tend to be more religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority. White working class Democrats are more in favor of gun rights and oppose affirmative action programs while non-white working class Democrats are more in favor of gun control measures and support affirmative action programs. Socially conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated and lowest earning ideological demographics. In 2005, only 15% had a college degree, compared to 27% at the national average and 49% of liberals, respectively.

The presidency of [[Jimmy Carter]] led to a right-wing shift in the Democratic Party. From [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to Richard Nixon, there was a bipartisan support for maintaining social liberal programs created as part of FDR's [[New Deal]]. The Carter administration was the first to begin deregulating and neo-liberalizing the United States economic system.\n\nIn 1985, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]], a faction within the party, was created after the landslide victory of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Ronald Reagan]] over Democrat [[Walter Mondale]] at the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 presidential election]].\n\nDuring the [[1992 United States presidential election]], Bill Clinton and Al Gore, both members of the Democratic Leadership Council, each ran as a [[New Democrats|New Democrat]], running as a Democrat for more limited government. On social issues, Clinton signed the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994]]. On LGBT rights, although coming out strongly in 1993 for open military service for LGBT Americans, Clinton settled on the compromise [[Don't ask, don't tell]] policy (signed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] into law) and signed [[Executive Order 12968]] and [[Executive Order 13087|13087]].\n\nThe [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries and caucuses]] was largely a three-way fight between [[John Kerry]], member of the [[New Democrat Coalition]], [[John Edwards]] (also a member of the New Democrat Coalition) and [[Howard Dean]], founder of [[Democracy for America]].\n\nMost neoliberal Democrats in Congress are members of the New Democrat Coalition, although the [[Blue Dog Coalition]] does include some [[Democratic Leadership Council]] members. There is considerable overlap in the membership of the New Democrats and Blue Dogs, with most of the Blue Dogs holding simultaneous membership and leadership positions with the New Democrats.\n\n===Conservative wing===\n{{main|Conservative Democrat}}\n{{See also|Democrats for Life of America}}\n{{See also|Blue Dog Coalition}}\n[[File:Senator Manchin.jpg|thumb|150px|[[United States Senator]] [[Joe Manchin]]]]\n\nFrom the 1860s to the 1940s, conservative Democrats came to mean opposition to the Radical Republicans who wanted to grant full citizenship rights to freed slaves and take political power away from the ex-Confederates. In the 1940s, the Democratic Party began to advocate against [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].\n\nThe [[conservative coalition]] was an unofficial coalition in the [[United States Congress]] bringing together a conservative majority of the Republican Party and the conservative, mostly [[Southern Democrats|Southern]] wing of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. It was dominant in Congress from 1937 to 1963 and remained a political force until the mid-1980s, eventually dying out in the 1990s. In terms of Congressional roll call votes, it primarily appeared on votes affecting labor unions. The conservative coalition did not operate on civil rights bills, for the two wings had opposing viewpoints.<ref>Katznelson, 1993</ref> However, the coalition did have the power to prevent unwanted bills from even coming to a vote. The coalition included many committee chairmen from the South who blocked bills by not reporting them from their committees. Furthermore, [[Howard W. Smith]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Rules|House Rules Committee]], often could kill a bill simply by not reporting it out with a favorable rule and he lost some of that power in 1961.<ref>Bruce J. Dierenfield, ''Keeper of the Rules: Congressman Howard W. Smith of Virginia'' (1987)</ref> The conservative coalition was not concerned with foreign policy as most of the [[Southern Democrats]] were internationalists, a position opposed by most [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].\n\nToday, conservative Democrats are generally regarded as members of the Democratic Party who are more conservative than the national political party as a whole. Today's conservative Democrats vary greatly in ideology. Some are [[fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] yet [[cultural liberalism|socially liberal]], somewhat akin to the now rare [[Moderate Republicans]], whereas others have a more [[communitarian]] ideology{{snd}}that is, socially moderate but in favor of qualified economic intervention {{snd}}reminiscent of [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] in Europe and Latin America. On foreign policy, conservative Democrats are generally [[liberal interventionism|liberal internationalists]].

From 1900 to 1920, liberals called themselves progressives and rallied behind Democrats such as [[William Jennings Bryan]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] to fight corruption, waste and big trusts. The Wilson administration saw the enactment of the [[the New Freedom|New Freedom]], progressive social programs enacted from 1913 to 1916, when the Democrats controlled Congress. The rise of the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movement saw the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and a push for civil rights legislation on the basis of gender. The first modern self-described liberal Democratic President was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who enacted the [[New Deal]], a series of [[social liberal]] programs enacted in the United States between 1933 and 1938 and a few that came later. From the 1940s onwards, liberal Democrats began pushing for [[desegregation]] and civil rights legislation for racial minorities. Starting in the 1960s, liberal Democrats began pushing for [[immigration reform]] and [[gun control]]. During the [[Cold War]], the liberal Democratic movement became [[anti-communist]].\n\nIn the 1970s, liberal Democrats began pushing for civil rights for disabled people, consumer protection, environmentalism, LGBT rights, reproductive rights and the end to capital punishment. The election of President Jimmy Carter in 1976 marked the end of the bipartisan support from presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt to [[Richard Nixon]] to the New Deal programs and marked the beginning of support among presidents for more [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies. The key legislative achievement of the Obama administration, the passage and enactment of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (Obamacare), was generally supported among liberal Democrats, but criticized by some for not going far enough. On [[social progressivism]], liberal Democrats achieved expansion of LGBT rights, federal hate crime laws, rescinding the [[Mexico City Policy]], later reinstituted by President [[Donald Trump]], rescinding the ban on federal taxpayer dollars to fund research on [[embryonic stem cells]], [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] and the [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw]]. In the 2010s, Democratic liberals began pushing for the [[legalization of cannabis]], succeeding in several states. President [[Barack Obama]], who opposed cannabis legalization despite being a former smoker himself, did not crack down on states that did legalize cannabis during his presidency.\n\nToday, liberal Democrats are generally regarded as being socially progressive. On economic issues, liberal Democrats vary, with some supporting neoliberal economics while others support [[Keynesian economics]] or a mixed economic system.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} On foreign policy, there is also a divide among liberal Democrats, with some being [[Liberal internationalism|liberal internationalists]] while other are less in favor of interventionism.\n\nThe presidency of Obama was comparatively further to the left than [[Bill Clinton]]'s. In 2011, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]], which supported more centrist and [[Third Way]] positions, was dissolved. Obama has opposed tax reform, the [[Keystone XL Pipeline]] and signed Obamacare into law. The candidacy of Hillary Clinton in 2016 continued this trend, as Secretary Clinton eschewed her husband's \"New Covenant\" centrism and fiscal moderation for liberal policies such as rolling back mandatory minimum sentencing laws, a debt-free college tuition plan for public university students and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/07/26/bill-clinton-democratic-convention/87542864/|title=Party of Clinton looks different than in 1992|first=Heidi|last=Przybyla|newspaper=USA Today}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/|title=Hillary Clinton Was Liberal.

The Asian American population had been a stronghold of the Republican Party until the [[United States presidential election]] of 1992 in which [[George H. W. Bush]] won 55% of the Asian American vote, compared to [[Bill Clinton]] winning 31% and [[Ross Perot]] winning 15% of the Asian vote. Originally, the vast majority of Asian Americans consisted of strongly anti-communist, pro-democracy [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese refugees]], Chinese Americans, [[Taiwanese Americans]], [[Korean Americans]] and socially conservative [[Filipino American|Filipinos]] who fled [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in the 1960s through the 1980s. The Republican Party's socially conservative, fervently anti-communist position strongly resonated with this original demographic. The Democratic Party made gains among the Asian American population starting in 1996 and in 2006 won 62% of the Asian American vote. Exit polls after the 2008 presidential election indicated that Democratic candidate [[Barack Obama]] had won 62% of the Asian American vote nationwide.<ref>\"[http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1209/racial-ethnic-voters-presidential-election?src=prc-latest&proj=peoplepress Dissecting the 2008 Electorate: Most Diverse in U.S. History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618075224/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1209/racial-ethnic-voters-presidential-election?src=prc-latest&proj=peoplepress |date=2012-06-18 }}\".

This saw a massive decline in the power of organized labor within the Democratic Party.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\"\n|+style=\"font-size:100%\"|National exit polling among union members\n|-\n!Year\n!Branch\n!colspan=\"2\"|% of Democratic vote among union members\n|-\n|[[2000 United States presidential election|2000]]<ref name=\"cnn200exitpollpresident\">{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/results/index.epolls.html|title=CNN.com \u2013 Election 2000 \u2013 Results|date=September 12, 2001|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010912213226/http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/results/index.epolls.html|archivedate=September 12, 2001}}</ref>\n|[[United States Presidency]]\n|align=right|{{bartable|62||2||background:red}}\n|-\n|[[United States House of Representatives elections, 2004|2004]]<ref name=\"cnn2004houseexitpoll\"/>\n|[[United States House of Representatives]]\n|align=right|{{bartable|65||2||background:red}}\n|-\n|[[2004 United States presidential election|2004]]<ref name=\"2004presidencyexit\"/>\n|[[United States Presidency]]\n|align=right|{{bartable|61||2||background:red}}\n|-\n|[[United States House of Representatives elections, 2006|2006]]<ref name=\"cnn2006houseexitpoll\"/>\n|[[United States House of Representatives]]\n|align=right|{{bartable|68||2||background:red}}\n|-\n|[[United States House of Representatives elections, 2008|2008]]<ref name=\"2008houseexitcnn3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=USH00p3|title=Local Exit Polls - Election Center 2008 - Elections & Politics from CNN.com}}</ref>\n|[[United States House of Representatives]]\n|align=right|{{bartable|65||2||background:red}}\n|-\n|[[2008 United States presidential election|2008]]<ref name=\"3President National Exit Poll2008\"/>\n|[[United States Presidency]]\n|align=right|{{bartable|60||2||background:red}}\n|-\n|}\n\n===LGBT Americans===\n{{see also|Stonewall Democrats}}\n{|\n|[[File:LGBT equality caucus in the 116th Congress.svg|thumb|upright=2|[[Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus]] in the [[116th United States Congress]]]]\n|[[File:Mark Pocan official photo.jpg|thumb|150px|[[United States Representative]] [[Mark Pocan]]]]\n|[[File:Tammy_Baldwin,_official_portrait,_113th_Congress.jpg|thumb|150px|[[United States Senator]] [[Tammy Baldwin]]]]\n|}\n\nSince the 1970s, [[LGBT Americans]] have become a key core consistency within the Democratic Party. In 1971, the [[Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club|Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club of San Francisco]] was formed as the first registered [[political action committee]] for LGBT Democrats in the nation. The [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] saw the first speaking slots for LGBT people at a Democratic National Convention, along with votes and rejecting LGBT rights plank to the Democratic Party platform. The presidency of [[Jimmy Carter]] was the first to address LGBT rights, but he did very little to address LGBT rights as President. In the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1980|1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], in response to Carter not doing enough for LGBT rights and not supporting an LGBT plank in the Democratic Party, [[Ted Kennedy]] courted to LGBT voters, supporting adding an LGBT plank to the Democratic Party. LGBT voters voted for Kennedy during the primary, helping him win the California primary and lead to the first LGBT plank to the Democratic Party. During the [[1988 United States presidential election]], [[Michael Dukakis]] was overtly homophobic, leading to many LGBT voters to boo him during a meeting Dukakis had with LGBT groups. Polling showed that [[George H. W. Bush]] won 35\u201340% of the LGBT vote during the 1988 presidential election.\n\nBoth presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] heavily targeted LGBT voters. Exit polling going back to 1990 to the present show that LGBT voters overwhelming prefer the Democratic Party over the Republican Party. On average, about 72.5% of LGBT voters voted Democratic in exit polling for the presidential elections dating from 1992 to the present. On average, about 74.42% of LGBT voters voted Democratic in exit polling for House of Representatives elections dating from 1990 to the present. In the 2012 election exit polls, Obama won 76% of LGBT voters. In the 2016 election polls, [[Hillary Clinton]] won 78% of LGBT voters.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\"\n|+style=\"font-size:100%\"|National polling of the 2008 Democratic presidential

The working class is largely distinguished by highly routinized and closely supervised work. It consists mainly of [[Clerk (position)#United States|clerical]] and [[blue-collar worker]]s.<ref name=\"The American Class Structure\"/> Even though most in the working class are able to afford an adequate [[standard of living]], high economic insecurity and possible personal benefit from an extended [[social safety net]] make the majority of working-class people left-of-center on economic issues. However, most working class Democrats differ from most liberals in their more socially conservative views. Working class Democrats tend to be more religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority. White working class Democrats are more in favor of gun rights and oppose affirmative action programs while non-white working class Democrats are more in favor of gun control measures and support affirmative action programs. Socially conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated and lowest earning ideological demographics. In 2005, only 15% had a college degree, compared to 27% at the national average and 49% of liberals, respectively.

Some of the more popular examples are finding specific versions of vulnerable [[Web application]]s. A search query with <code>intitle: admbook intitle: Fversion filetype: php</code> would locate all web pages that have that particular text contained within them. It is normal for [[default (computer science)|default]] installations of applications to include their running version in every page they serve, for example, \"Powered by XOOPS 2.2.3 Final\".\n\nDevices connected to the Internet can be found. A search string such as <code>inurl: \"ViewerFrame?Mode=\"</code> will find public web cameras.\n\nAnother useful search is following <code>intitle: index.of</code> followed by a search keyword. This can give a list of files on the servers. For example, <code>intitle: index.of mp3</code> will give all the MP3 files available on various servers.\n\n==Advanced operators==\nThere are many similar advanced operators which can be used to exploit insecure websites:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
