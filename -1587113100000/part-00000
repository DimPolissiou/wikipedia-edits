Two women have served or are serving as  [[Mayor of the District of Columbia|mayors]] of the [[District of Columbia]]. Currently, nine women are serving as governors of U.S. states, along with the Mayor of the District of Columbia [[Muriel Bowser]], and territorial governors [[Lou Leon Guerrero]] of [[Guam]] and [[Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced]] of [[Puerto Rico]].\n\n==History==\nThe first woman to act as governor was [[Carolyn B. Shelton]], who served as acting governor of Oregon for one weekend \u2013 9 a.m. Saturday, February 27, through 10 a.m. Monday, March 1, 1909. The outgoing governor, [[George Earle Chamberlain]], had been elected to the Senate and had to leave for Washington, D.C., before his term was over, and the incoming governor, [[Frank W. Benson (Oregon governor)|Frank W. Benson]], had gotten sick and couldn't assume office early. Chamberlain left Shelton, his secretary, in charge for the weekend.<ref>{{cite book |last=Long |first=James Andrew |title=Oregon Firsts: Past and Present |year=1994 |publisher=Oregon Firsts Media |location=North Plains, Ore. |isbn=1-882635-00-0 |pages=57}}</ref> It was another three and a half years before women were allowed to vote in Oregon.<ref name=\"Oregon Historical Quarterly\">{{cite journal |last=Kessler |first=Lauren |title=The Ideas of Woman Suffrage and the Mainstream Press|journal=Oregon Historical Quarterly| year=1983 |volume=84 |pages=257\u201376}}</ref>{{efn|Chamberlain and Shelton married each other 17 years later.<ref name=\"Time Magazine milestones, July 26, 1926\">{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,846678,00.html |title=Milestones: Jul. 26, 1926 |date=July 26, 1926 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}</ref>}}\n\nThe first female acting governor to be entrusted with substantial duties while in office was [[Soledad C.

Hinkle]] attended the Democratic Convention in New York. Lieutenant Governor Jose A. Baca had died unexpectedly in May, so Chac\u00f3n, the Secretary of State, filled the position. Chac\u00f3n said she believed that her 1924 elevation was the first time in the U.S. that a woman had been called on to assume the responsibilities of governor.<ref name=\"AJ20100824\">[[Albuquerque Journal]], October 24, 2010, reporting on an article from ''Albuquerque Morning Journal'', June 21, 1924.</ref>\n\nThe first woman to assume office as governor pursuant to a special election was [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]] of [[Wyoming]] (widow of late Governor [[William B.

Arizona was the first state where a woman followed another woman as governor (they were from different parties). Arizona also has had the most female governors with a total of four, and is the first state to have three women in a row serve as governor.\n\nA record nine out of 50 state governorships have been held by women since [[Kristi Noem]] was inaugurated as governor of South Dakota on January 5, 2019. This ties a record previously met on two different occasions: first, between December 4, 2006, when [[Sarah Palin]] was inaugurated as the first female governor of [[Alaska]], and January 14, 2008, when [[Kathleen Blanco]] left office as governor of [[Louisiana]], and second, between January 10, 2009, when [[Beverly Perdue]] was inaugurated as governor of [[North Carolina]], and January 20, 2009, when [[Ruth Ann Minner]] retired as governor of [[Delaware]]. The U.S. [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|Commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[District of Columbia]], though not states, have also had female chief executives: Governors [[Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n]] and [[Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced]], and Mayors [[Sharon Pratt Kelly]] and [[Muriel Bowser]], respectively. Additionally, [[Lou Leon Guerrero]] has served as the governor of [[Guam]] since January 2019.\n\nAs of 2019, a total of 20 states have never had a female governor. Those states are: [[Arkansas]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Idaho]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Maryland]], [[Minnesota]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[Nevada]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[North Dakota]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Wisconsin]]. Six states (Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Ohio, Tennessee, and Utah) have never even seen a major party nominate a female candidate in a gubernatorial election, although [[List of lieutenant governors of Minnesota|nine consecutive female lieutenant governors]] have served in Minnesota, from 1983 to the present day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2014/01/16/minnesota-where-female-lieuten/ |title=Minnesota: Where Female Lieutenant Governors Reign {{!}} Smart Politics |website=editions.lib.umn.edu |language=en-CA |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere have only been three ethnic minority female governors of states: [[Susana Martinez]] and [[Michelle Lujan Grisham]] of New Mexico (both Hispanic) and [[Nikki Haley]] of South Carolina (Asian American).

Shelton]], who served as acting governor of Oregon for one weekend \u2013 9 a.m. Saturday, February 27, through 10 a.m. Monday, March 1, 1909. The outgoing governor, [[George Earle Chamberlain]], had been elected to the Senate and had to leave for Washington, D.C., before his term was over, and the incoming governor, [[Frank W.

Arizona was the first state where a woman followed another woman as governor (they were from different parties). Arizona also has had the most female governors with a total of four, and is the first state to have three women in a row serve as governor.\n\nA record nine out of 50 state governorships have been held by women since [[Kristi Noem]] was inaugurated as governor of South Dakota on January 5, 2019. This ties a record previously met on two different occasions: first, between December 4, 2006, when [[Sarah Palin]] was inaugurated as the first female governor of [[Alaska]], and January 14, 2008, when [[Kathleen Blanco]] left office as governor of [[Louisiana]], and second, between January 10, 2009, when [[Beverly Perdue]] was inaugurated as governor of [[North Carolina]], and January 20, 2009, when [[Ruth Ann Minner]] retired as governor of [[Delaware]]. The U.S. [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|Commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[District of Columbia]], though not states, have also had female chief executives: Governors [[Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n]] and [[Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced]], and Mayors [[Sharon Pratt Kelly]] and [[Muriel Bowser]], respectively. Additionally, [[Lou Leon Guerrero]] has served as the governor of [[Guam]] since January 2019.\n\nAs of 2019, a total of 20 states have never had a female governor. Those states are: [[Arkansas]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Idaho]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Maryland]], [[Minnesota]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[Nevada]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[North Dakota]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Wisconsin]]. Six states (Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Ohio, Tennessee, and Utah) have never even seen a major party nominate a female candidate in a gubernatorial election, although [[List of lieutenant governors of Minnesota|nine consecutive female lieutenant governors]] have served in Minnesota, from 1983 to the present day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2014/01/16/minnesota-where-female-lieuten/ |title=Minnesota: Where Female Lieutenant Governors Reign {{!}} Smart Politics |website=editions.lib.umn.edu |language=en-CA |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere have only been three ethnic minority female governors of states: [[Susana Martinez]] and [[Michelle Lujan Grisham]] of New Mexico (both Hispanic) and [[Nikki Haley]] of South Carolina (Asian American).

The main story follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American, as he is caught in a civil war involving Kyrat's Royal Army, controlled by tyrannical king Pagan Min, and a rebel movement called the Golden Path. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players battle enemy soldiers and dangerous wildlife using a wide array of weapons. The game features many elements found in [[role-playing game]]s, such as a branching storyline, and side quests. The game also features a map editor both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes.\n\nAnnounced in May 2014, development on ''Far Cry 4'' began immediately after the shipment of ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'' in late 2012. The team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to ''Far Cry 3'' that continues ''3''<nowiki/>'s story, but the idea was later scrapped and the team decided to develop a new setting and new story for the game. Certain aspects of ''Far Cry 4'' were inspired by the [[Nepalese Civil War]], and the costume of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films ''[[Ichi the Killer (film)|Ichi the Killer]]'' and ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brother]]''. The game's competitive multiplayer was created by [[Red Storm Entertainment]] while the Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by [[Ubisoft Toronto]]. The game was released for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], and  [[Microsoft Windows]] in November 2014.\n\n''Far Cry 4'' was met with a mostly positive critical reception upon release. Critics praised the open world design, visuals, soundtrack, and characters, particularly antagonist Pagan Min, as well as new gameplay additions and the wealth of content. However, some critics disliked the story and found the game too similar to its predecessor. The game was a commercial success, selling seven million copies by the end of 2014, and was the biggest launch in the franchise's history. Several releases of downloadable content were subsequently published. A successor, ''[[Far Cry 5]]'', was released in March 2018.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Far Cry 4'' is a [[first-person perspective|first-person]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game. Players assume control of Ajay Ghale, a Kyrati-American who is on a quest to spread his deceased mother's ashes in the [[fictional country]] of Kyrat. Ajay may utilize various short and long range firearms, including [[Pistol|pistols]], [[Revolver|revolvers]], [[Shotgun|shotguns]], [[Assault rifle|assault rifles]], [[Submachine gun|submachine guns,]] [[Bow and arrow|bows]], a [[flamethrower]], [[Rocket launcher|rocket launchers]], [[Grenade launcher|grenade launchers]], and [[Sniper rifle|sniper]] rifles. More powerful versions of these weapons become available after considerable progression through the game. Throwable weapons include [[Grenade|fragmentation grenades]], [[Molotov cocktail|Molotov cocktails]], and [[Throwing knife|throwing knives]].  <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjYmryqBrc|title=Far Cry 4 \u2013 The Gun Show|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 23, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322120526/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjYmryqBrc|archive-date=March 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The game allows players to take cover to avoid gunfights and to perform melee takedowns from above or up-close.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/87165/far-cry-4-review-surviving-war-and-wildlife|title=Far Cry 4 Review: Surviving War and Wildlife|first=Steven|last=Wong|work=[[Shacknews]]|date=November 18, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910085311/http://www.shacknews.com/article/87165/far-cry-4-review-surviving-war-and-wildlife|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Unlike previous installments in the series, ''Far Cry 4'' gives players the ability to kick objects and the ability to hide the corpses of enemies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-10-far-cry-4-gameplay-footage-shows-co-op-grapple-hook-kicking|title=Far Cry 4 gameplay footage shows co-op, grapple hook, kicking|first=Robert|last=Purchase|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910041405/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-10-far-cry-4-gameplay-footage-shows-co-op-grapple-hook-kicking|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> \n[[File:Far Cry 4 gameplay screenshot 1.jpg|thumb|right|In ''Far Cry 4'', players have the ability to ride on elephants.]]\nPlayers can use a variety of methods to approach missions.

The Tiger upgrades mainly improve players' offensive abilities, while The Elephant upgrades improve players' defensive skills. A variety of random events and hostile encounters take place throughout the game; for example, the player may unexpectedly be attacked by an eagle, be hit by a car, or witness an animal attack. Players can accumulate karma by performing kind actions towards the rebels, such as by assisting them in battles when they are attacked by wildlife or enemies.

Kyrat was once an autonomous state in the Himalayas ruled by a royal family before being engulfed in a series of civil wars. Ajay finds the country in a state of conflict between Kyrat's Royal Army, led by the country's eccentric and tyrannical King Pagan Min, and the Golden Path, a rebel movement fighting to free Kyrat from Min's oppressive rule. The choices Ajay makes will determine the fate of Kyrat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-story-details-emerge/1100-6419756/|title=Far Cry 4 story details emerge|first=Chris|last=Pereira|date=May 20, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829111422/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-story-details-emerge/1100-6419756/|archive-date=August 29, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nAfter the death of his mother Ishwari, Ajay Ghale ([[James A. Woods]]) returns to his home country of Kyrat to carry out Ishwari's final wish by returning her ashes to Lakshmana. However, his mission is interrupted when the bus he is traveling on is attacked by the Royal Army and he is taken prisoner by Pagan Min ([[Troy Baker]]), the country's eccentric and violent king, who claims to have been romantically involved with Ishwari. After finding his way through Pagan's mansion, Ajay escapes with the aid of Sabal ([[Naveen Andrews]]), a commander in the Golden Path, a rebel movement established by Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale. Ajay is not able to leave the country as the Royal Army has taken control of Kyrat's only airport and sealed the borders.\n\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = Troy Baker SDCC 2019 (48378614692) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1 = Photograph of Troy Baker\n | image2 = MyleneDinhRobic.WikiFr.jpg\n | alt2 = Photograph of Myl\u00e8ne Dinh-Robic\n | footer = Troy Baker and Myl\u00e8ne Dinh-Robic voice two of the game's antagonists}}\nIn the twenty-odd years since Ishwari and Ajay fled Kyrat, the rebellion has stagnated, with the Golden Path now fighting for their very existence. As the son of Mohan Ghale, Ajay becomes a symbol for the Golden Path to rally around. After freeing a group of hostages and liberating territory held by Pagan, the Golden Path plan on breaking Pagan's stranglehold on power by targeting his three regional governors: Paul \"De Pleur\" Harmon ([[Travis Willingham]]), who oversees opium production and runs Pagan's torture chambers; Noore Najjar ([[Myl\u00e8ne Dinh-Robic]]), who runs poaching and prostitution rings and who became a victim of Pagan's cruelty herself after he kidnapped her family; and Yuma Lau ([[Gwendoline Yeo]]), Min's adopted sister and trusted general who is obsessed with uncovering the secrets of the mystical realm of Shangri-La.\n\nHowever the Golden Path's newfound momentum is threatened by deep divisions between its commanders, Sabal, who favors traditional values, and Amita ([[Janina Gavankar]]), who argues for progress, which includes relying heavily on drug trade. Ajay is forced to intervene on several occasions, with his decisions influencing the direction the Golden Path takes. The first governor to fall is De Pleur after Noore helps Ajay find a way to infiltrate De Pleur's stronghold, allowing the rebellion to capture him. Amita and Sabal later task Ajay with confronting and killing Noore. She dies in her fighting arena, either with Ajay killing her, or with Noore committing suicide upon learning Pagan had her family executed years beforehand.\n\nAs the Golden Path secures Kyrat's southern provinces, Ajay is contacted by Willis Huntley ([[Alain Goulem]]), a CIA agent who offers intelligence for the rebels and pages from his father's diary in exchange for killing Yuma's lieutenants. After Ajay kills several of them, Huntley admits they were in fact CIA assets, and that he was sent to clean up after the CIA as the agency did not see Pagan as a threat anymore. Huntley betrays Ajay to Pagan just as the Golden Path prepare to push into Northern Kyrat.\n\nAjay ends up in Yuma's mountain prison, from which he manages to escape. In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because of his affections toward Ajay's late mother.{{efn|The ''Escape from Durgesh Prison'' downloadable content takes place at this point in the story.}} The Golden Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the Golden Path. Whichever leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other to prevent them from starting another civil war, and Ajay can choose to either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the Golden Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.\n\n===Endings===\nAjay encounters Pagan, who chastises him for fleeing at the start of the game, claiming that he only ever intended to help Ajay. Pagan offers Ajay a final decision: shoot him now, or listen to him. If Ajay shoots Pagan, the game ends immediately and the credits roll. If Ajay instead chooses to listen, Pagan reveals that Mohan sent Ishwari to spy on Pagan in the early days of the Golden Path, but they fell in love and had a daughter together: Lakshmana, Ajay's [[half-sister]]. Mohan killed Lakshmana for Ishwari's betrayal, and Ishwari killed him in turn before leaving the country with the infant Ajay. Pagan shows Ajay to a shrine containing Lakshmana's ashes, and Ajay places Ishwari's ashes inside. Pagan then boards a helicopter and departs peacefully, leaving the country in Ajay's hands. The player can choose to shoot down Pagan's helicopter as it flies away, killing Pagan in the process.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Golden Path seizes control of Kyrat. The final ending depends on which leader Ajay ultimately sided with. If Amita is placed in charge, she turns Kyrat into an [[authoritarian]] drug state, forcing villagers into work in factories and drug fields, and [[Conscription|conscripting]] [[Child soldiers|children]] into the group as soldiers to bolster their ranks against the remnants of the Royal Army; Ajay also learns that she has had her sister, Bhadra, taken away, \"never to come again\". If Sabal is placed in charge, Kyrat becomes a patriarchal fundamentalist theocracy where all of Amita's supporters are executed, women are denied fundamental political rights, and Bhadra is anointed as a religious symbol for the country to rally around. The player has the choice to kill the Golden Path's leader or leave them alive.\n\nAn [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] ending can be found at the beginning of the game. To trigger it, Ajay must simply wait at the dinner table in Pagan's mansion; when Pagan returns, he thanks Ajay for being a \"gentleman\" and leads him to Lakshmana's shrine, telling Ajay of his family history. After Ajay plants his mother's ashes at the shrine, Pagan invites Ajay to join him to \"finally shoot some goddamn guns\".<ref>Good, Owen. (November 15, 2014).

After tending to Ajay's wounds, Min leaves him in a tower in Northern Kyrat, as he is unable to return Ajay to the Golden Path directly. He then leaks news of Ajay's escape to Sabal and Amita, and allows them to secure a Royal Army helicopter so that they can extract him. However, word of this has spread to Yuma, who marshals the forces loyal to her and plans to attack the landing site once Ajay tries to escape. Because of this, Ajay only has a limited window of opportunity to escape, but can buy more time by attacking Yuma's forces. In exchange for disrupting Yuma's plans for a coup, Min promises Ajay support and resources at the landing site. During his missions, Ajay overhears one of the guards of Yuma saying that she was sent to a valley in the northern mountains of Kyrat on an expedition after something of great power called \"The Relic\". After killing Yuma's lieutenants, disrupting her supply lines, and thwarting her plans to sabotage Min's communications, Ajay ventures to the landing site where he is forced to fight off Yuma's attack long enough for the helicopter to power up. With the landing site secured and Yuma's forces in disarray, Ajay is successfully airlifted out contacts Sabal and Amita saying that he was heading to the valley to learn what is behind the expedition and the Relic.\n\n===''Valley of the Yetis''===\n''Valley of the Yetis'' is a downloadable additional chapter of content which takes place directly after ''Escape from Durgesh Prison''.\n\nIn his way to the Lost Valley to learn more about the expedition Yuma sent after the Relic, Ajay's helicopter is shot down by an unknown assailant. Ajay survives the crash, but awakens to discover that the pilot has been abducted and taken deeper into the valley. Ajay follows him intent on rescue, only to discover that the valley is occupied by an aggressive army. Liberating a relay station in a bid to re-establish contact with the Golden Path, he is forced to fight off wave after wave of attackers whilst being taunted by a voice over the radio. Investigating further, Ajay discovers the army is calling themselves the Disciples of Yalung, and is a [[cult]] worshiping a demon from Kyrati mythology. The Disciples have harnessed an evil that permeates the valley to transform their followers into \"Awakened\", or [[yeti]]s, and are amassing their forces to attack Kyrat. Realizing that he cannot return to Kyrat without dealing with the cult, Ajay gradually destroys their ranks before scaling a glacier to find the source of Yalung's influence. After successfully destroying a tree that provides the Disciples with their power, Ajay sees himself as an Awakened, although this is supposedly just a hallucination.\n-->\n\n==Development==\nThe game's development was led by [[Ubisoft Montreal]], which took over the development of the ''Far Cry'' franchise after the release of ''[[Far Cry: Instincts]]'' in 2005. Additional development was handled by four other in-house Ubisoft studios, [[Ubisoft Toronto]], [[Red Storm Entertainment]], [[Ubisoft Shanghai]], and [[Ubisoft Kiev]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ubi.com/far-cry-4-release-date-kyrat/|title=Far Cry 4 \u2013 Welcome To Kyrat|first=Gary|last=Steinman|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018162348/http://blog.ubi.com/far-cry-4-release-date-kyrat/|archive-date=October 18, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The Montreal studio worked on the game's campaign, the Toronto studio worked on the Shangri-La segments of the campaign, Red Storm handled the development of the competitive multiplayer, the Shanghai studio worked on the hunting missions, and the Kiev studio developed the game's PC version.<ref name=\"VentureBeat interview\">{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/14/how-ubisoft-aims-to-dominate-shooter-open-worlds-with-far-cry-4-interview/2/|title=How Ubisoft aims to dominate open-world shooters with Far Cry 4 (interview)|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=October 14, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309022749/http://venturebeat.com/2014/10/14/how-ubisoft-aims-to-dominate-shooter-open-worlds-with-far-cry-4-interview/2/|archive-date=March 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>  Development of the game began in late 2012, after the shipment of ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]''.

The sequel would be set on the same tropical island, would expand upon the protagonist's story, and would bring back characters, such as ''Far Cry 3''<nowiki/>'s secondary antagonist, Vaas. However, after four days, the team found that a sequel was not what they wanted to achieve. As a result, they decided to scrap the idea and build a brand new game with a new setting and a new set of characters. The team adapted a \"we want it all\" approach, in which they hoped to experiment with all kinds of ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2014/10/15/far-cry-4-pc-ps4-xbox-one/|title=Far Cry 3.5 was a thing \u2013 for about four days, says Ubisoft|first=Stephany|last=Nunneley|work=[[VG247]]|date=October 15, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815200713/http://www.vg247.com/2014/10/15/far-cry-4-pc-ps4-xbox-one/|archive-date=August 15, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Some team members hoped that the game would allow players to fly, which led to the game's verticality.<ref name=\"FarCry3.5\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.ubi.com/far-cry-4-isnt-just-far-cry-3-5/|title=Why Far Cry 4 Isn't Just Far Cry 3.5|first=Gary|last=Steinman|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|date=October 14, 2014|access-date=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911184709/http://blog.ubi.com/far-cry-4-isnt-just-far-cry-3-5/|archive-date=September 11, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The game's director also hoped that players would be able to ride a rampaging elephant, in a place with \"exotic mountainsides\" and \"unique culture\".

The decision to bring the two back was made because the team thought that they should provide some references to previous games in the series, as all of the games are set in the same universe even though they are not directly related.<ref name=\"DSInterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/interviews/a592636/far-cry-4-interview-alex-hutchinson-on-kyrat-pagan-min-and-co-op.html#~pmnhi0dIkd5ao1|title=Far Cry 4 interview: Alex Hutchinson on Kyrat, Pagan Min and co-op|first=Matthew|last=Reynolds|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=August 29, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906103649/http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/interviews/a592636/far-cry-4-interview-alex-hutchinson-on-kyrat-pagan-min-and-co-op.html#~pmnhi0dIkd5ao1|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSome of the gameplay elements were directly taken from ''Far Cry 3''. Exotic locations, hunting, and the freedom for players to complete missions through different approaches were maintained in ''Far Cry 4''. The team hoped that by incorporating and expanding upon on these ideas, while introducing new features, they could make ''Far Cry 4'' an evolution for the series. As a result, the size of the game's outposts became larger and players were given more options to customize their weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/08/far-cry-4-creative-director-discusses-the-returning-elements-of-far-cry-3|title=Far Cry 4 Creative Director Discusses The Returning Elements of Far Cry 3|first=Cassidee|last=Moser|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924225150/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/08/far-cry-4-creative-director-discusses-the-returning-elements-of-far-cry-3|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The team also realized that players spent a lot of time interacting with the open world of ''Far Cry 3'', and decided to put more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.<ref name=\"VentureBeat interview\"/>\n\n===Setting and characters===\nThe game's setting, Kyrat, is a fictional country in the Himalayas region. When building Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including [[Nepal]] and [[Tibet]], but exaggerated those elements. The map's size is similar to that of ''Far Cry 3'', but is more dense, diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/far-cry-4-interview-with-creative-director-alex-hutchinson-at-e3-2014/|title=Far Cry 4 interview with creative director Alex Hutchinson at E3 2014|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924152917/http://www.pcgamer.com/far-cry-4-interview-with-creative-director-alex-hutchinson-at-e3-2014/|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identity for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also designed to accommodate new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In an effort to make the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead of simply being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world.<ref name=\"DSInterview\"/> In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the local culture,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a589108/far-cry-4-behind-the-scenes-trailer-sees-developers-visit-a-hindu-temple.html#~prIxN5ZC6YXODx|title=Exclusive: Far Cry 4 behind-the-scenes trailer sees developers visit a Hindu temple|first=Matthew|last=Reynolds|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=August 7, 2014|accessdate=October 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808081634/http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a589108/far-cry-4-behind-the-scenes-trailer-sees-developers-visit-a-hindu-temple.html#~prIxN5ZC6YXODx|archive-date=August 8, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> so that they could bring those ideas back to the studio.

The team hoped that players would be \"shocked, amazed and intrigued\" by him in every encounter. Min has a complex relationship with the playable character, Ghale, as the team wanted players to guess Min's intentions and add a layer of mystery to him.<ref name=\"VentureBeat interview\"/> The team originally hoped to have a villain that had a \"punk-rock mentality\", but the idea was abandoned as the team thought that the concept was not original. The pink costume Min wears throughout the game was inspired by Beat Takeshi, a character from ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brothers]]'', and Ichi, a character from ''[[Ichi the Killer (film)|Ichi the Killer]]''. Min is designed to be sadistic yet confident, and the team hired [[Troy Baker]] to provide the voice for Min, as they thought that Baker's voice is charismatic enough to suit Min.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_4/b/xboxone/archive/2014/06/13/the-face-of-evil-a-look-at-far-cry-4-controversial-villain.aspx|title=Far Cry 4: The Face Of Evil: A Look At Ubisoft's Controversial Villain|first=Ben|last=Reeves|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=June 13, 2014|access-date=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325093120/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_4/b/xboxone/archive/2014/06/13/the-face-of-evil-a-look-at-far-cry-4-controversial-villain.aspx|archive-date=March 25, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/exploring-far-cry-4s-sadistic-complicated-villain-/1100-6422572/|title=Exploring Far Cry 4's Sadistic, Complicated Villain Pagan Min|first=Justin|last=Haywald|date=September 26, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828062439/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/exploring-far-cry-4s-sadistic-complicated-villain-/1100-6422572/|archive-date=August 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Baker, Ubisoft gave him a script for the audition but he chose not to follow it, and instead decided to threaten to cut off the face of an assistant using Min's tone.

When creating these segments, the team put a lot of emphasis on the use of colors. They hoped that the artistic vision for ''Far Cry 4'' would not feature any resemblance to other typical shooter games. It was originally designed to be a small open world, but was later converted into a linear experience due to time constraints and huge creative differences between developers. The team later decided to simplify it, and re-imagined it into an \"ancient, natural world\". It is made up of five different colors. The main color of Shangri-La is gold; the developers thought that using gold as the foundation added \"warmth\" to the dreamland. Meanwhile, red was used heavily to add a sense of strangeness, as well as for establishing a tie to the game's narrative and story. Orange was used as a color of interaction, while white was used to add purity to the world. Blue is the last of Shangri-La's main colors, and represents dangers and honor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/3/16/8219481/shangri-la-far-cry-4-artwork-gallery-gdc-2015|title=Painting Shangri-La|first=Dave|last=Tach|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=March 16, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812091615/http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/3/16/8219481/shangri-la-far-cry-4-artwork-gallery-gdc-2015|archive-date=August 12, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Multiplayer===\nUbisoft promised that ''Far Cry 4'' would have much more of a multiplayer element than ''Far Cry 3''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-will-have-a-lot-more-multiplayer-than-far-cry-3/1100-6419681/|title=Far Cry 4 will have \"a lot more multiplayer\" than Far Cry 3|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 16, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904134739/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-will-have-a-lot-more-multiplayer-than-far-cry-3/1100-6419681/|archive-date=September 4, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Some elements that were scrapped for ''Far Cry 3'' due to time constraints were featured in ''Far Cry 4'', such as the \"Guns for Hire\" co-operative multiplayer mode.<ref name=\"VentureBeat interview\"/> Building a co-operative experience was the team's goal starting from the beginning of the game's development.

The company chose an asymmetrical structure for this mode, so that players could have different experiences in different matches, as well as to make matches feel more chaotic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/videos/iukn6b/far-cry-4-the-making-of-pvp--battles-of-kyrat-|title=Far Cry 4:The Making of PvP (Battles of Kyrat)|work=[[GameTrailers]]|date=December 4, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924122413/http://www.gametrailers.com/videos/iukn6b/far-cry-4-the-making-of-pvp--battles-of-kyrat-|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The developers originally planned to feature female playable characters, but the plan was scrapped due to animation problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-12-far-cry-4-almost-had-female-co-op-characters|title=Far Cry 4 \"almost\" had female co-op characters|first=Tom|last=Phillips|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 12, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911001206/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-12-far-cry-4-almost-had-female-co-op-characters|archive-date=September 11, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Ubisoft announced a 'Keys to Kyrat' offer for players that owned a copy of the game for the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4.

story received mixed responses. Chris Carter from [[Destructoid]] praised the personality of Ajay Ghale, which is \"less in-your-face\" than that of ''Far Cry 3'''s protagonist [[Jason Brody]]. He also praised the villain, Pagan Min, who he considered took the spotlight every time he appeared in the game.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> Josh Harmon from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' thought that the characters in this game had more depth, and that the choices made by players throughout the game were meaningful.<ref name=\"EGM\"/> Aoife Wilson from [[Eurogamer]] thought that the game's characters were memorable, but was disappointed by the story.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/> Nick Tan, from [[Game Revolution]], also praised Min's personality, but he complained that the character appeared too seldom in the game.<ref name=\"GameRev\"/> Edwin Evans-Thirlwell, writing for [[GamesRadar]], thought that the story grew tiresome as players progressed, even though some of its characters were interesting. He further criticized the game's writing, which he thought was lackluster.<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> Mike Splechta from ''GameZone'' praised the game's voice acting and applauded its storyline, calling it satisfying.<ref name=\"GZ\"/>\n\nThe game's setting received positive responses. Carter thought that the verticality nature of the game's map created obstacles for players when they were traveling between places. However, he praised the interesting lore and wildlife found within the world, as well as the game's long [[draw distance]].<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> Harmon had similar comments, praising the game's graphics and Kyrat's culture. Harmon thought that the hilly landscape of the game's world gave players a sense of exploration, and hence made traversal enjoyable.<ref name=\"EGM\"/> Wilson thought, however, that the game's setting was not as compelling as the tropical setting of ''Far Cry 3''.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/> Nevertheless, she praised the Shangri-la section, which she thought had changed the game's landscape drastically. Matt Bertz from ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the game's setting, which he thought was vibrant, varied and rich.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Ludwig Kietzmann from [[Joystiq]] praised the content found within the world, and thought that the world itself was absorbing and interesting.<ref name=\"Joystiq2\"/>\n\nThe game's design also received acclaim. Carter from Destructoid thought that the fortress and the outpost system provided players with a sense of accomplishment and success, and he considered having the freedom to use different ways to approach and complete missions one of the greatest parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> However he criticized the upgrade system, which he thought was directly converted from ''Far Cry 3'' and was uninspiring. ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''<nowiki/>'s Harmon thought that the introduction of the helicopter was dull. Mitch Dyer, from [[IGN]], praised the game's economy system, which he thought was satisfying. He added that it gives players motivations to complete side-quests.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> [[Justin McElroy]] of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.<ref name=\"Poly\"/>\n\nThe game's multiplayer mode received mixed response. Carter compared the competitive multiplayer to that of ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'', and called it \"skippable\". He considered the co-operative multiplayer a fun addition to the game, but was disappointed by its limitations. He also added that the game would still be a strong title without these multiplayer elements.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> Bertz from ''Game Informer'' also found the multiplayer shallow and poorly-executed. He also criticized the lack of a large player pool and dedicated servers.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Evans-Thirlwell of GamesRadar thought that the game's co-operative multiplayer were fun to play, but the asymmetrical competitive multiplayer was easy to forget.<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> In contrast, ''GameZone''{{'s}} Splechta thought that the competitive multiplayer mode was \"a surprise\" for him.<ref name=\"GZ\"/> Dyer echoed similar statement, and he thought that it had successfully captured the scale and freedom offered by both the game's co-op and campaign.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nHarmon thought that ''Far Cry 4'' was an improvement over ''Far Cry 3'', but he thought that the game felt and played too similarly to ''Far Cry 3'', and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for ''Far Cry 4'' is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by ''Far Cry 4'' did not stray far away from ''Far Cry 3''.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to ''Far Cry 3'', but also other Ubisoft franchises like ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' and ''[[Watch Dogs]]''.<ref name=\"GameRev\"/> Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by ''Far Cry 4'' was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel.<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\n===Sales===\nUbisoft expected the game to sell at least six million copies in its first year of release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-goes-gold-ubisoft-expecting-6-million-sa/1100-6423284/|title=Far Cry 4 Goes Gold, Ubisoft Expecting 6 Million Sales in First Year|author=Eddie Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=October 30, 2014|accessdate=February 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213033151/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-goes-gold-ubisoft-expecting-6-million-sa/1100-6423284/|archive-date=February 13, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Far Cry 4'' became the fastest-selling game and the most successful launch in the series in the first week of release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/far_cry_4/news/far_cry_4_is_the_fastest-selling_game_in_the_series_so_far.html|title=Far Cry 4 is the fastest-selling game in the series so far|author=David Scammell|work=VideoGamer.com|date=November 24, 2014|accessdate=February 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213054038/http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/far_cry_4/news/far_cry_4_is_the_fastest-selling_game_in_the_series_so_far.html|archive-date=February 13, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Far Cry 4'' was the second best selling game in the United Kingdom for all-formats during the week of its release, only behind ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/gta_5/news/uk_video_game_chart_gta_5_is_the_uks_no_1_ahead_of_far_cry_4.html|title=UK Video Game Chart: GTA 5 is the UK's No.1 ahead of Far Cry 4|first=James|last=Orry|work=VideoGamer.com|date=November 24, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705202429/http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/gta_5/news/uk_video_game_chart_gta_5_is_the_uks_no_1_ahead_of_far_cry_4.html|archive-date=July 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also the sixth best selling game in the US according to [[The NPD Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/12/xbox-one-the-best-selling-console-in-the-us-and-uk-in-november|title=Xbox One: The Best Selling Console In The US (And UK) In December|first=Colin|last=Moriarty|work=[[IGN]]|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910103408/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/12/xbox-one-the-best-selling-console-in-the-us-and-uk-in-november|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> As of December 31, 2014, the game has shipped seven million copies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ubisoft\u00ae reports third quarter 2014\u201315 sales|url=https://www.ubisoftgroup.com/comsite_common/en-US/images/pressrelease_downloadablemm_20150212_050959_ubisoftq3fy15englishfinaltcm99193930.pdf|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|access-date=February 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213212843/https://www.ubisoftgroup.com/comsite_common/en-US/images/pressrelease_downloadablemm_20150212_050959_ubisoftq3fy15englishfinaltcm99193930.pdf|archive-date=February 13, 2015|date=February 13, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\nThe game received the Best Shooter Award from [[IGN]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/lists/best-of-games-genre/shooter|title=Best Games, By Genre|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=August 26, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6VT1Px2O3?url=http://www.ign.com/lists/best-of-games-genre/shooter|archive-date=January 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The game was nominated for Best Artistic Achievement, Best Game Design, Best Music, Best Performer (Troy Baker), and Best Story at the [[11th British Academy Games Awards]].

It is the successor to the 2012 video game ''[[Far Cry 3]]'', and the fourth main installment in the ''[[Far Cry]]'' series. The game takes place in Kyrat, a fictional [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] country. The main story follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American, as he is caught in a civil war involving Kyrat's Royal Army, controlled by tyrannical king Pagan Min, and a rebel movement called the Golden Path. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players battle enemy soldiers and dangerous wildlife using a wide array of weapons. The game features many elements found in [[role-playing game]]s, such as a branching storyline, and side quests. The game also features a map editor both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes.\n\nAnnounced in May 2014, development on ''Far Cry 4'' began immediately after the shipment of ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'' in late 2012. The team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to ''Far Cry 3'' that continues ''3''<nowiki/>'s story, but the idea was later scrapped and the team decided to develop a new setting and new story for the game. Certain aspects of ''Far Cry 4'' were inspired by the [[Nepalese Civil War]], and the costume of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films ''[[Ichi the Killer (film)|Ichi the Killer]]'' and ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brother]]''. The game's competitive multiplayer was created by [[Red Storm Entertainment]] while the Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by [[Ubisoft Toronto]]. The game was released for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], and  [[Microsoft Windows]] in November 2014.\n\n''Far Cry 4'' was met with a mostly positive critical reception upon release. Critics praised the open world design, visuals, soundtrack, and characters, particularly antagonist Pagan Min, as well as new gameplay additions and the wealth of content. However, some critics disliked the story and found the game too similar to its predecessor. The game was a commercial success, selling seven million copies by the end of 2014, and was the biggest launch in the franchise's history. Several releases of downloadable content were subsequently published. A successor, ''[[Far Cry 5]]'', was released in March 2018.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Far Cry 4'' is a [[first-person perspective|first-person]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game. Players assume control of Ajay Ghale, a Kyrati-American who is on a quest to spread his deceased mother's ashes in the [[fictional country]] of Kyrat. Ajay may utilize various short and long range firearms, including [[Pistol|pistols]], [[Revolver|revolvers]], [[Shotgun|shotguns]], [[Assault rifle|assault rifles]], [[Submachine gun|submachine guns,]] [[Bow and arrow|bows]], a [[flamethrower]], [[Rocket launcher|rocket launchers]], [[Grenade launcher|grenade launchers]], and [[Sniper rifle|sniper]] rifles. More powerful versions of these weapons become available after considerable progression through the game. Throwable weapons include [[Grenade|fragmentation grenades]], [[Molotov cocktail|Molotov cocktails]], and [[Throwing knife|throwing knives]].  <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjYmryqBrc|title=Far Cry 4 \u2013 The Gun Show|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 23, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322120526/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjYmryqBrc|archive-date=March 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The game allows players to take cover to avoid gunfights and to perform melee takedowns from above or up-close.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/87165/far-cry-4-review-surviving-war-and-wildlife|title=Far Cry 4 Review: Surviving War and Wildlife|first=Steven|last=Wong|work=[[Shacknews]]|date=November 18, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910085311/http://www.shacknews.com/article/87165/far-cry-4-review-surviving-war-and-wildlife|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Unlike previous installments in the series, ''Far Cry 4'' gives players the ability to kick objects and the ability to hide the corpses of enemies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-10-far-cry-4-gameplay-footage-shows-co-op-grapple-hook-kicking|title=Far Cry 4 gameplay footage shows co-op, grapple hook, kicking|first=Robert|last=Purchase|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910041405/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-10-far-cry-4-gameplay-footage-shows-co-op-grapple-hook-kicking|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> \n[[File:Far Cry 4 gameplay screenshot 1.jpg|thumb|right|In ''Far Cry 4'', players have the ability to ride on elephants.]]\nPlayers can use a variety of methods to approach missions.

Players can earn experience points by completing missions and defeating enemies, and these experience points can then be spent on performance boosts and upgrades. There are two sets of abilities for players to choose from, called The Tiger and The Elephant. The Tiger upgrades mainly improve players' offensive abilities, while The Elephant upgrades improve players' defensive skills. A variety of random events and hostile encounters take place throughout the game; for example, the player may unexpectedly be attacked by an eagle, be hit by a car, or witness an animal attack. Players can accumulate karma by performing kind actions towards the rebels, such as by assisting them in battles when they are attacked by wildlife or enemies. Doing so will give players discounts when purchasing new items at trading posts, and will allow players to call in support and back-up from members of the Golden Path.<ref name=\"PCTrailer\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-14-why-ajay-ghale-isnt-the-real-star-of-far-cry-4|title=Why Ajay Ghale isn't the real star of Far Cry 4|first=Aoife|last=Wilson|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=October 14, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907181857/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-14-why-ajay-ghale-isnt-the-real-star-of-far-cry-4|archive-date=September 7, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Players can also gain experience by collecting items like masks, propaganda posters, and [[prayer wheel]]s.<ref name=\"Tips\"/> There is also an Arena mode, in which players battle human enemies and animals for additional experience points and rewards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4s-arena-mode-is-a-gladiator-style-humans-/1100-6422371/|title=Far Cry 4's Arena Mode Is a Gladiator-Style, Humans vs. Animals Affair|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=September 17, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906190759/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4s-arena-mode-is-a-gladiator-style-humans-/1100-6422371/|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Far Cry 4'' features a [[co-operative gameplay|co-operative multiplayer]] mode known as \"Guns for Hire\", which supports up to two players.

The game follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American who returns to his native country of Kyrat (a fictional [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] country derived from the [[Kirati people|Kirat]] ethnicities of Nepal and northern India) to spread his deceased mother's ashes. Kyrat was once an autonomous state in the Himalayas ruled by a royal family before being engulfed in a series of civil wars. Ajay finds the country in a state of conflict between Kyrat's Royal Army, led by the country's eccentric and tyrannical King Pagan Min, and the Golden Path, a rebel movement fighting to free Kyrat from Min's oppressive rule. The choices Ajay makes will determine the fate of Kyrat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-story-details-emerge/1100-6419756/|title=Far Cry 4 story details emerge|first=Chris|last=Pereira|date=May 20, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829111422/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-story-details-emerge/1100-6419756/|archive-date=August 29, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nAfter the death of his mother Ishwari, Ajay Ghale ([[James A. Woods]]) returns to his home country of Kyrat to carry out Ishwari's final wish by returning her ashes to Lakshmana. However, his mission is interrupted when the bus he is traveling on is attacked by the Royal Army and he is taken prisoner by Pagan Min ([[Troy Baker]]), the country's eccentric and violent king, who claims to have been romantically involved with Ishwari. After finding his way through Pagan's mansion, Ajay escapes with the aid of Sabal ([[Naveen Andrews]]), a commander in the Golden Path, a rebel movement established by Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale. Ajay is not able to leave the country as the Royal Army has taken control of Kyrat's only airport and sealed the borders.\n\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = Troy Baker SDCC 2019 (48378614692) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1 = Photograph of Troy Baker\n | image2 = MyleneDinhRobic.WikiFr.jpg\n | alt2 = Photograph of Myl\u00e8ne Dinh-Robic\n | footer = Troy Baker and Myl\u00e8ne Dinh-Robic voice two of the game's antagonists}}\nIn the twenty-odd years since Ishwari and Ajay fled Kyrat, the rebellion has stagnated, with the Golden Path now fighting for their very existence. As the son of Mohan Ghale, Ajay becomes a symbol for the Golden Path to rally around. After freeing a group of hostages and liberating territory held by Pagan, the Golden Path plan on breaking Pagan's stranglehold on power by targeting his three regional governors: Paul \"De Pleur\" Harmon ([[Travis Willingham]]), who oversees opium production and runs Pagan's torture chambers; Noore Najjar ([[Myl\u00e8ne Dinh-Robic]]), who runs poaching and prostitution rings and who became a victim of Pagan's cruelty herself after he kidnapped her family; and Yuma Lau ([[Gwendoline Yeo]]), Min's adopted sister and trusted general who is obsessed with uncovering the secrets of the mystical realm of Shangri-La.\n\nHowever the Golden Path's newfound momentum is threatened by deep divisions between its commanders, Sabal, who favors traditional values, and Amita ([[Janina Gavankar]]), who argues for progress, which includes relying heavily on drug trade. Ajay is forced to intervene on several occasions, with his decisions influencing the direction the Golden Path takes. The first governor to fall is De Pleur after Noore helps Ajay find a way to infiltrate De Pleur's stronghold, allowing the rebellion to capture him. Amita and Sabal later task Ajay with confronting and killing Noore. She dies in her fighting arena, either with Ajay killing her, or with Noore committing suicide upon learning Pagan had her family executed years beforehand.\n\nAs the Golden Path secures Kyrat's southern provinces, Ajay is contacted by Willis Huntley ([[Alain Goulem]]), a CIA agent who offers intelligence for the rebels and pages from his father's diary in exchange for killing Yuma's lieutenants. After Ajay kills several of them, Huntley admits they were in fact CIA assets, and that he was sent to clean up after the CIA as the agency did not see Pagan as a threat anymore. Huntley betrays Ajay to Pagan just as the Golden Path prepare to push into Northern Kyrat.\n\nAjay ends up in Yuma's mountain prison, from which he manages to escape. In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because of his affections toward Ajay's late mother.{{efn|The ''Escape from Durgesh Prison'' downloadable content takes place at this point in the story.}} The Golden Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the Golden Path. Whichever leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other to prevent them from starting another civil war, and Ajay can choose to either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the Golden Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.\n\n===Endings===\nAjay encounters Pagan, who chastises him for fleeing at the start of the game, claiming that he only ever intended to help Ajay. Pagan offers Ajay a final decision: shoot him now, or listen to him. If Ajay shoots Pagan, the game ends immediately and the credits roll. If Ajay instead chooses to listen, Pagan reveals that Mohan sent Ishwari to spy on Pagan in the early days of the Golden Path, but they fell in love and had a daughter together: Lakshmana, Ajay's [[half-sister]]. Mohan killed Lakshmana for Ishwari's betrayal, and Ishwari killed him in turn before leaving the country with the infant Ajay. Pagan shows Ajay to a shrine containing Lakshmana's ashes, and Ajay places Ishwari's ashes inside. Pagan then boards a helicopter and departs peacefully, leaving the country in Ajay's hands. The player can choose to shoot down Pagan's helicopter as it flies away, killing Pagan in the process.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Golden Path seizes control of Kyrat. The final ending depends on which leader Ajay ultimately sided with. If Amita is placed in charge, she turns Kyrat into an [[authoritarian]] drug state, forcing villagers into work in factories and drug fields, and [[Conscription|conscripting]] [[Child soldiers|children]] into the group as soldiers to bolster their ranks against the remnants of the Royal Army; Ajay also learns that she has had her sister, Bhadra, taken away, \"never to come again\". If Sabal is placed in charge, Kyrat becomes a patriarchal fundamentalist theocracy where all of Amita's supporters are executed, women are denied fundamental political rights, and Bhadra is anointed as a religious symbol for the country to rally around. The player has the choice to kill the Golden Path's leader or leave them alive.\n\nAn [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] ending can be found at the beginning of the game. To trigger it, Ajay must simply wait at the dinner table in Pagan's mansion; when Pagan returns, he thanks Ajay for being a \"gentleman\" and leads him to Lakshmana's shrine, telling Ajay of his family history. After Ajay plants his mother's ashes at the shrine, Pagan invites Ajay to join him to \"finally shoot some goddamn guns\".<ref>Good, Owen. (November 15, 2014).

After tending to Ajay's wounds, Min leaves him in a tower in Northern Kyrat, as he is unable to return Ajay to the Golden Path directly. He then leaks news of Ajay's escape to Sabal and Amita, and allows them to secure a Royal Army helicopter so that they can extract him. However, word of this has spread to Yuma, who marshals the forces loyal to her and plans to attack the landing site once Ajay tries to escape. Because of this, Ajay only has a limited window of opportunity to escape, but can buy more time by attacking Yuma's forces. In exchange for disrupting Yuma's plans for a coup, Min promises Ajay support and resources at the landing site. During his missions, Ajay overhears one of the guards of Yuma saying that she was sent to a valley in the northern mountains of Kyrat on an expedition after something of great power called \"The Relic\". After killing Yuma's lieutenants, disrupting her supply lines, and thwarting her plans to sabotage Min's communications, Ajay ventures to the landing site where he is forced to fight off Yuma's attack long enough for the helicopter to power up. With the landing site secured and Yuma's forces in disarray, Ajay is successfully airlifted out contacts Sabal and Amita saying that he was heading to the valley to learn what is behind the expedition and the Relic.\n\n===''Valley of the Yetis''===\n''Valley of the Yetis'' is a downloadable additional chapter of content which takes place directly after ''Escape from Durgesh Prison''.\n\nIn his way to the Lost Valley to learn more about the expedition Yuma sent after the Relic, Ajay's helicopter is shot down by an unknown assailant. Ajay survives the crash, but awakens to discover that the pilot has been abducted and taken deeper into the valley. Ajay follows him intent on rescue, only to discover that the valley is occupied by an aggressive army. Liberating a relay station in a bid to re-establish contact with the Golden Path, he is forced to fight off wave after wave of attackers whilst being taunted by a voice over the radio. Investigating further, Ajay discovers the army is calling themselves the Disciples of Yalung, and is a [[cult]] worshiping a demon from Kyrati mythology. The Disciples have harnessed an evil that permeates the valley to transform their followers into \"Awakened\", or [[yeti]]s, and are amassing their forces to attack Kyrat. Realizing that he cannot return to Kyrat without dealing with the cult, Ajay gradually destroys their ranks before scaling a glacier to find the source of Yalung's influence. After successfully destroying a tree that provides the Disciples with their power, Ajay sees himself as an Awakened, although this is supposedly just a hallucination.\n-->\n\n==Development==\nThe game's development was led by [[Ubisoft Montreal]], which took over the development of the ''Far Cry'' franchise after the release of ''[[Far Cry: Instincts]]'' in 2005.

The sequel would be set on the same tropical island, would expand upon the protagonist's story, and would bring back characters, such as ''Far Cry 3''<nowiki/>'s secondary antagonist, Vaas. However, after four days, the team found that a sequel was not what they wanted to achieve. As a result, they decided to scrap the idea and build a brand new game with a new setting and a new set of characters. The team adapted a \"we want it all\" approach, in which they hoped to experiment with all kinds of ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2014/10/15/far-cry-4-pc-ps4-xbox-one/|title=Far Cry 3.5 was a thing \u2013 for about four days, says Ubisoft|first=Stephany|last=Nunneley|work=[[VG247]]|date=October 15, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815200713/http://www.vg247.com/2014/10/15/far-cry-4-pc-ps4-xbox-one/|archive-date=August 15, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Some team members hoped that the game would allow players to fly, which led to the game's verticality.<ref name=\"FarCry3.5\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.ubi.com/far-cry-4-isnt-just-far-cry-3-5/|title=Why Far Cry 4 Isn't Just Far Cry 3.5|first=Gary|last=Steinman|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|date=October 14, 2014|access-date=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911184709/http://blog.ubi.com/far-cry-4-isnt-just-far-cry-3-5/|archive-date=September 11, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The game's director also hoped that players would be able to ride a rampaging elephant, in a place with \"exotic mountainsides\" and \"unique culture\".

As a result, the size of the game's outposts became larger and players were given more options to customize their weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/08/far-cry-4-creative-director-discusses-the-returning-elements-of-far-cry-3|title=Far Cry 4 Creative Director Discusses The Returning Elements of Far Cry 3|first=Cassidee|last=Moser|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924225150/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/08/far-cry-4-creative-director-discusses-the-returning-elements-of-far-cry-3|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The team also realized that players spent a lot of time interacting with the open world of ''Far Cry 3'', and decided to put more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.<ref name=\"VentureBeat interview\"/>\n\n===Setting and characters===\nThe game's setting, Kyrat, is a fictional country in the Himalayas region. When building Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including [[Nepal]] and [[Tibet]], but exaggerated those elements. The map's size is similar to that of ''Far Cry 3'', but is more dense, diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/far-cry-4-interview-with-creative-director-alex-hutchinson-at-e3-2014/|title=Far Cry 4 interview with creative director Alex Hutchinson at E3 2014|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924152917/http://www.pcgamer.com/far-cry-4-interview-with-creative-director-alex-hutchinson-at-e3-2014/|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identity for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also designed to accommodate new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In an effort to make the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead of simply being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world.<ref name=\"DSInterview\"/> In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the local culture,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a589108/far-cry-4-behind-the-scenes-trailer-sees-developers-visit-a-hindu-temple.html#~prIxN5ZC6YXODx|title=Exclusive: Far Cry 4 behind-the-scenes trailer sees developers visit a Hindu temple|first=Matthew|last=Reynolds|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=August 7, 2014|accessdate=October 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808081634/http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a589108/far-cry-4-behind-the-scenes-trailer-sees-developers-visit-a-hindu-temple.html#~prIxN5ZC6YXODx|archive-date=August 8, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> so that they could bring those ideas back to the studio.

The team hoped that players would be \"shocked, amazed and intrigued\" by him in every encounter. Min has a complex relationship with the playable character, Ghale, as the team wanted players to guess Min's intentions and add a layer of mystery to him.<ref name=\"VentureBeat interview\"/> The team originally hoped to have a villain that had a \"punk-rock mentality\", but the idea was abandoned as the team thought that the concept was not original. The pink costume Min wears throughout the game was inspired by Beat Takeshi, a character from ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brothers]]'', and Ichi, a character from ''[[Ichi the Killer (film)|Ichi the Killer]]''. Min is designed to be sadistic yet confident, and the team hired [[Troy Baker]] to provide the voice for Min, as they thought that Baker's voice is charismatic enough to suit Min.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_4/b/xboxone/archive/2014/06/13/the-face-of-evil-a-look-at-far-cry-4-controversial-villain.aspx|title=Far Cry 4: The Face Of Evil: A Look At Ubisoft's Controversial Villain|first=Ben|last=Reeves|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=June 13, 2014|access-date=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325093120/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_4/b/xboxone/archive/2014/06/13/the-face-of-evil-a-look-at-far-cry-4-controversial-villain.aspx|archive-date=March 25, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/exploring-far-cry-4s-sadistic-complicated-villain-/1100-6422572/|title=Exploring Far Cry 4's Sadistic, Complicated Villain Pagan Min|first=Justin|last=Haywald|date=September 26, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828062439/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/exploring-far-cry-4s-sadistic-complicated-villain-/1100-6422572/|archive-date=August 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Baker, Ubisoft gave him a script for the audition but he chose not to follow it, and instead decided to threaten to cut off the face of an assistant using Min's tone.

In order to increase players' agency and make the story to feel more connected to the world for players, the team introduced a branching storyline which required players to make choices that would lead to different results and alter the game's ending.<ref name=\"PolyE3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/a/e3-2014/far-cry-4|title=Far Cry's new creative director talks story, co-op and scope|first=Alexa|last=Ray Corriea|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912050849/http://www.polygon.com/a/e3-2014/far-cry-4|archive-date=September 12, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The team hoped that by adding choices, they could add additional depth and meaning to the game's campaign.

When creating these segments, the team put a lot of emphasis on the use of colors. They hoped that the artistic vision for ''Far Cry 4'' would not feature any resemblance to other typical shooter games. It was originally designed to be a small open world, but was later converted into a linear experience due to time constraints and huge creative differences between developers. The team later decided to simplify it, and re-imagined it into an \"ancient, natural world\". It is made up of five different colors. The main color of Shangri-La is gold; the developers thought that using gold as the foundation added \"warmth\" to the dreamland. Meanwhile, red was used heavily to add a sense of strangeness, as well as for establishing a tie to the game's narrative and story. Orange was used as a color of interaction, while white was used to add purity to the world. Blue is the last of Shangri-La's main colors, and represents dangers and honor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/3/16/8219481/shangri-la-far-cry-4-artwork-gallery-gdc-2015|title=Painting Shangri-La|first=Dave|last=Tach|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=March 16, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812091615/http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/3/16/8219481/shangri-la-far-cry-4-artwork-gallery-gdc-2015|archive-date=August 12, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Multiplayer===\nUbisoft promised that ''Far Cry 4'' would have much more of a multiplayer element than ''Far Cry 3''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-will-have-a-lot-more-multiplayer-than-far-cry-3/1100-6419681/|title=Far Cry 4 will have \"a lot more multiplayer\" than Far Cry 3|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 16, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904134739/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-will-have-a-lot-more-multiplayer-than-far-cry-3/1100-6419681/|archive-date=September 4, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Some elements that were scrapped for ''Far Cry 3'' due to time constraints were featured in ''Far Cry 4'', such as the \"Guns for Hire\" co-operative multiplayer mode.<ref name=\"VentureBeat interview\"/> Building a co-operative experience was the team's goal starting from the beginning of the game's development.

}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Far Cry 4'' received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MCPC\"/><ref name=\"MCPS4\"/><ref name=\"MCXONE\"/>\n\nThe game's story received mixed responses. Chris Carter from [[Destructoid]] praised the personality of Ajay Ghale, which is \"less in-your-face\" than that of ''Far Cry 3'''s protagonist [[Jason Brody]]. He also praised the villain, Pagan Min, who he considered took the spotlight every time he appeared in the game.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> Josh Harmon from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' thought that the characters in this game had more depth, and that the choices made by players throughout the game were meaningful.<ref name=\"EGM\"/> Aoife Wilson from [[Eurogamer]] thought that the game's characters were memorable, but was disappointed by the story.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/> Nick Tan, from [[Game Revolution]], also praised Min's personality, but he complained that the character appeared too seldom in the game.<ref name=\"GameRev\"/> Edwin Evans-Thirlwell, writing for [[GamesRadar]], thought that the story grew tiresome as players progressed, even though some of its characters were interesting. He further criticized the game's writing, which he thought was lackluster.<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> Mike Splechta from ''GameZone'' praised the game's voice acting and applauded its storyline, calling it satisfying.<ref name=\"GZ\"/>\n\nThe game's setting received positive responses. Carter thought that the verticality nature of the game's map created obstacles for players when they were traveling between places. However, he praised the interesting lore and wildlife found within the world, as well as the game's long [[draw distance]].<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> Harmon had similar comments, praising the game's graphics and Kyrat's culture. Harmon thought that the hilly landscape of the game's world gave players a sense of exploration, and hence made traversal enjoyable.<ref name=\"EGM\"/> Wilson thought, however, that the game's setting was not as compelling as the tropical setting of ''Far Cry 3''.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/> Nevertheless, she praised the Shangri-la section, which she thought had changed the game's landscape drastically. Matt Bertz from ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the game's setting, which he thought was vibrant, varied and rich.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Ludwig Kietzmann from [[Joystiq]] praised the content found within the world, and thought that the world itself was absorbing and interesting.<ref name=\"Joystiq2\"/>\n\nThe game's design also received acclaim. Carter from Destructoid thought that the fortress and the outpost system provided players with a sense of accomplishment and success, and he considered having the freedom to use different ways to approach and complete missions one of the greatest parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> However he criticized the upgrade system, which he thought was directly converted from ''Far Cry 3'' and was uninspiring. ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''<nowiki/>'s Harmon thought that the introduction of the helicopter was dull. Mitch Dyer, from [[IGN]], praised the game's economy system, which he thought was satisfying. He added that it gives players motivations to complete side-quests.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> [[Justin McElroy]] of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.<ref name=\"Poly\"/>\n\nThe game's multiplayer mode received mixed response. Carter compared the competitive multiplayer to that of ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'', and called it \"skippable\". He considered the co-operative multiplayer a fun addition to the game, but was disappointed by its limitations. He also added that the game would still be a strong title without these multiplayer elements.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> Bertz from ''Game Informer'' also found the multiplayer shallow and poorly-executed. He also criticized the lack of a large player pool and dedicated servers.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Evans-Thirlwell of GamesRadar thought that the game's co-operative multiplayer were fun to play, but the asymmetrical competitive multiplayer was easy to forget.<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> In contrast, ''GameZone''{{'s}} Splechta thought that the competitive multiplayer mode was \"a surprise\" for him.<ref name=\"GZ\"/> Dyer echoed similar statement, and he thought that it had successfully captured the scale and freedom offered by both the game's co-op and campaign.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nHarmon thought that ''Far Cry 4'' was an improvement over ''Far Cry 3'', but he thought that the game felt and played too similarly to ''Far Cry 3'', and he added that the game was unambitious.

In [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] the United States scored one of its most surprising victories with a [[United States v England (1950 FIFA World Cup)|1\u20130 win]] over heavily favored [[England national football team|England]], who were amongst the world's best sides at the time.\n\nThe United States did not reach another World Cup until an upstart team qualified for the [[1990 World Cup]] with the \"goal heard around the world\" scored by [[Paul Caligiuri]] against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]], which started the modern era of soccer in the United States. The 1990 men's national team was quickly disposed of at the World Cup, but nonetheless had qualified for its first World Cup in 40 years.\n\nThe United States hosted the [[1994 World Cup|1994 FIFA World Cup]], setting total and average attendance records that still stand, including drawing 94,194 fans to the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. The United States made a surprising run to the second round with a shocking victory over [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] which saw [[Andr\u00e9s Escobar]], the player responsible for the United States' first goal (an own goal), later shot to death in his homeland.\n\n[[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] saw another disappointing addition to the history of the men's national team as it finished last out of the 32 teams that qualified for the World Cup. This embarrassment, which included a total collapse of team chemistry and leadership, led to the firing of manager [[Steve Sampson]].\n\nThe U.S. team hired [[Bruce Arena]], who had won the first two [[MLS Cup]]s in [[Major League Soccer]] history, and who went on to become the most successful United States men's national team manager in history. In [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] Bruce Arena led a mix of veterans and MLS-seasoned youth to a quarterfinal appearance, dispatching contenders [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[2002 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]] play and archrivals [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in the Round of 16, before losing a closely fought game with eventual runners-up [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the quarterfinal.\n\nThe team looked to match or surpass that feat in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]]; the U.S. was drawn into [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group E|Group E]] with [[Italy national football team|Italy]], the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]. The United States lost to the Czech Republic 3\u20130 in their opening game, drew Italy, 1\u20131, in their second game (a match that saw two U.S. players and an Italian player [[Red card (soccer)|red carded]]), and lost to Ghana, 2\u20131. The United States did not qualify for a knockout round, but were the only team to face eventual champion Italy without losing. In the wake of the team's disappointing performance, Arena's contract was not renewed.\n\n[[Bob Bradley]], [[C.D. Chivas USA|Chivas USA]] manager and Arena's assistant manager with the men's national team, eventually succeeded Arena in 2007. The U.S. qualified for the [[2010 World Cup|2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/match?id=279519&cc=5901|title=October 10, 2009: Honduras 2\u20133 USA|publisher=espnfc.com}}</ref> winning the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CONCACAF Fourth Round|CONCACAF qualifying tournament]]. At the World Cup, the Americans tied England 1\u20131, tied [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]], 2\u20132. and then won their group in [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group C|Group C]] by defeating [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] 1\u20130 on a stoppage time goal by Landon Donovan. In the Round of 16, the United States played with [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]] runners-up [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], and fell 2\u20131 in [[Extra time (association football)|overtime]] (OT).\n\nEntering the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil, the U.S team won all three friendly \"send-off\" matches leading up to the competition: 2\u20130, over [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]], 2\u20131, over [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], and 2\u20131 over fellow World Cup participant and defending [[Africa Cup of Nations|African]] champions [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]. They were led at the time by [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]], who helped lead West Germany to victory in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] and was the first player to score at least three goals in three consecutive World Cups.\n\nDuring the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the U.S. won their first match against Ghana, 2\u20131. [[Clint Dempsey]] scored in the first minute of the match giving the U.S. the early lead. Ghana did not respond until the 82nd minute scoring the equalizer goal. The U.S. then reclaimed the lead, thanks to [[John Anthony Brooks|John Brooks]] scoring the game-winning goal off his head just four minutes later in the 86th minute to regain the lead and take the match. The U.S. gained three points for their win and was off to a great start in the \"[[Group of Death]]\" claimed by critics for the teams the U.S. would have to go through in [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]] ([[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]).\n\nThe second match of the World Cup for the U.S. was a different story. Portugal claimed the early lead, with [[Nani]] scoring in the 5th minute to take the early 1\u20130 lead. It wasn't till the 64th minute till the U.S. scored the equalizing goal, thanks to [[Jermaine Jones]], tying the match at 1 apiece. The U.S. then claimed the lead on a goal by Clint Dempsey again, scoring in the 81st minute to take a 2\u20131 lead. However, in the final minute of extra time, the world player of the year, [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] drilled a perfect cross to teammate [[Silvestre Varela]] who headed in the tying goal, making the final score 2\u20132. The tie gave each team a point in the overall standings, bringing the U.S. to 4 points total, and gave Portugal their first point of the World Cup having lost their opening match to Germany, 4\u20130. The U.S. claimed a spot in the knockout round in spite of a 1\u20130 loss to eventual champion Germany in their final [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]] game due to them winning the tiebreaker with Portugal. However, they bowed out the tournament in the round of 16 in a 2\u20131 loss to [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group H|Group H]] winner [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. Goalkeeper [[Tim Howard]] helped the U.S. keep a 0\u20130 tie at full time. In extra time, there were two Belgian goals. The U.S. struck back with a goal by 19-year-old phenom [[Julian Green]] but could not manage another goal.

The [[United States Youth Soccer Association]] boasts over three million players between the ages of five and 19, while [[American Youth Soccer Organization]] has more than 300,000 players between the ages of four and 19.

The league began an aggressive expansion in 2017, with the goal of adding at least eight clubs but ultimately adding 10. The expansion saw the following clubs added: [[Atlanta United FC]] (2017), [[Minnesota United FC]] (2017), [[Los Angeles FC]] (2018), [[FC Cincinnati]] (2019), [[Inter Miami CF]] (2020), [[Nashville SC (MLS)|Nashville SC]] (2020), [[Austin FC]] (2021), [[Charlotte MLS team|Charlotte]] (2021), [[Sacramento Republic FC]] (2022) and [[St. Louis MLS team|St. Louis]] (2022). The league operates as a single-entity league, which means MLS, and not the individual teams, holds the contracts on players.\n\nThe one sanctioned second-division men's outdoor soccer league is the [[USL Championship]] (USLC). Previously, the second [[North American Soccer League]] had second-division status, sharing it with the USL in the 2017 season, but the NASL was denied second-division sanctioning for 2018 due to considerable instability in the league;<ref>{{cite web| url=http://fiftyfive.one/2017/09/us-soccer-federation-rejects-nasls-division-ii-application/|title=US Soccer Federation Rejects NASL's Division II Application |date= September 5, 2017}}</ref> the league effectively folded at that time.\n\nThe USLC was sanctioned as the United States' lone Division II men's outdoor soccer league in 2018.

The USLC is the world's largest Division II professional league by number of teams. Since 2014, valuation of USL Championship clubs have increased five-fold. In revenue, 2018 Championship clubs saw a 28% increase over 2017 numbers on an average of ticketing, sponsorship, merchandise, and ancillary revenue generation.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe USLC also holds a broadcast agreement with ESPN that sees 20 regular season games televised nationally on ESPN2, ESPNews and ESPN Deportes<ref>https://www.uslsoccer.com/news_article/show/1044596</ref> in addition to national broadcast of the USL Championship Final, which in 2019 was aired on both ESPN2 and ESPN Deportes. The league's remaining regular season games are broadcast nationally on ESPN+, with 22 of the Championship's clubs also holding local broadcast agreements. The USL Championship's broadcast agreement was made possible in large part by a major investment by USL with league technology partner Vista Worldlink<ref>https://www.uslsoccer.com/news_article/show/751106-vista-usl-productions-form-cutting-edge-initiative</ref> to establish a USL Broadcast Center out of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.<ref>https://www.sportsvideo.org/2017/04/21/vista-worldlink-goes-all-in-on-at-home-production-with-overhauled-facility/</ref>\n\nThe second NASL had no official tie to the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|former NASL]] that operated from 1968 to 1984, although some of the teams shared names with their historic counterparts. Unlike MLS that is a single-entity operation, the second NASL, like the old NASL, had no salary cap and players were contracted by the individual teams.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nasl.com/media-guide/2011/Media%20Guide_Final_11-07-2011_book.pdf |title=NASL 2011 Media Guide |date=November 7, 2011}}</ref> The season was a split format (similar to that of [[Apertura and Clausura|many leagues in Latin America]]) that features seven teams, including one [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] team.

However, a dispute among its teams and ownership led to the creation of the NASL which applied for and was awarded by USSF second division status.

The champion of WPS' first season in 2009 was [[Sky Blue FC]], out of the New York\u2013New Jersey area. They defeated the [[Los Angeles Sol]] 1\u20130 at The Home Depot Center in Carson, California. WPS launched with seven teams, all based in the United States. The Sol folded after the league's inaugural season, and two new teams joined for 2010, bringing WPS to eight teams. However, the 2010 season saw considerable instability, with another charter team, [[Saint Louis Athletica]], folding during the season, champions [[FC Gold Pride]] folding after the season, and the [[Chicago Red Stars]] deciding to regroup in the second-tier [[Women's Premier Soccer League]] (WPSL). The 2011 season, in which six teams based along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] played, was marked by low attendance for most of the season and conflict with [[Dan Borislow]], who had purchased the former [[Washington Freedom]], moved the team to [[Miami metropolitan area|South Florida]], and renamed it [[MagicJack (WPS)|magicJack]]. The dispute between WPS and Borislow led the league to suspend the magicJack franchise, with Borislow responding by suing. The legal battle led WPS to suspend its 2012 season, with hopes of returning in 2013, but WPS soon decided to fold completely.\n\n====National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), 2013\u2013present====\n{{main|National Women's Soccer League}}\n[[File:Portland Thorns FC players (16497728163).jpg|240px|thumb|right|[[Portland Thorns]] players before a match, April 2015]]\nOn November 21, 2012, U.S. Soccer, in conjunction with the [[Canadian Soccer Association]] (CSA) and [[Mexican Football Federation]] (FMF), announced the formation of a new professional league for the 2013 season.<ref name=\"2013 women's league\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.ussoccer.com/News/Womens-National-Team/2012/11/US-Soccer-President-Sunil-Gulati-Announces-New-Womens-League-for-2013.aspx |title=U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati Announces New Women's League to Begin Play in Spring of 2013 |publisher=United States Soccer Federation |date=November 21, 2012 |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101173733/http://www.ussoccer.com/News/Womens-National-Team/2012/11/US-Soccer-President-Sunil-Gulati-Announces-New-Womens-League-for-2013.aspx |archive-date=January 1, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The league, unnamed at the time of the initial announcement but later unveiled as the [[National Women's Soccer League]] (NWSL), launched in April 2013 with eight teams.<ref name=\"2013 women's league\"/> Like WUSA and WPS, NWSL teams are privately owned with some owned by existing [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] teams.<ref name=Carlisle>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/blog/_/name/soccerusa/id/661?cc=5901|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128075504/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/blog/_/name/soccerusa/id/661?cc=5901|archivedate=November 28, 2012 |title=Hopes high for new women's soccer league |first=Jeff |last=Carlisle |series=Soccer USA blog|work=[[ESPN FC]] |date=November 21, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref> The American and Canadian federations pay the salaries for many of their respective national team members.

In [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] the United States scored one of its most surprising victories with a [[United States v England (1950 FIFA World Cup)|1\u20130 win]] over heavily favored [[England national football team|England]], who were amongst the world's best sides at the time.\n\nThe United States did not reach another World Cup until an upstart team qualified for the [[1990 World Cup]] with the \"goal heard around the world\" scored by [[Paul Caligiuri]] against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]], which started the modern era of soccer in the United States. The 1990 men's national team was quickly disposed of at the World Cup, but nonetheless had qualified for its first World Cup in 40 years.\n\nThe United States hosted the [[1994 World Cup|1994 FIFA World Cup]], setting total and average attendance records that still stand, including drawing 94,194 fans to the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. The United States made a surprising run to the second round with a shocking victory over [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] which saw [[Andr\u00e9s Escobar]], the player responsible for the United States' first goal (an own goal), later shot to death in his homeland.\n\n[[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] saw another disappointing addition to the history of the men's national team as it finished last out of the 32 teams that qualified for the World Cup. This embarrassment, which included a total collapse of team chemistry and leadership, led to the firing of manager [[Steve Sampson]].\n\nThe U.S. team hired [[Bruce Arena]], who had won the first two [[MLS Cup]]s in [[Major League Soccer]] history, and who went on to become the most successful United States men's national team manager in history. In [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] Bruce Arena led a mix of veterans and MLS-seasoned youth to a quarterfinal appearance, dispatching contenders [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[2002 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]] play and archrivals [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in the Round of 16, before losing a closely fought game with eventual runners-up [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the quarterfinal.\n\nThe team looked to match or surpass that feat in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]]; the U.S. was drawn into [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group E|Group E]] with [[Italy national football team|Italy]], the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]. The United States lost to the Czech Republic 3\u20130 in their opening game, drew Italy, 1\u20131, in their second game (a match that saw two U.S. players and an Italian player [[Red card (soccer)|red carded]]), and lost to Ghana, 2\u20131. The United States did not qualify for a knockout round, but were the only team to face eventual champion Italy without losing. In the wake of the team's disappointing performance, Arena's contract was not renewed.\n\n[[Bob Bradley]], [[C.D.

At the World Cup, the Americans tied England 1\u20131, tied [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]], 2\u20132. and then won their group in [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group C|Group C]] by defeating [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] 1\u20130 on a stoppage time goal by Landon Donovan. In the Round of 16, the United States played with [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]] runners-up [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], and fell 2\u20131 in [[Extra time (association football)|overtime]] (OT).\n\nEntering the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil, the U.S team won all three friendly \"send-off\" matches leading up to the competition: 2\u20130, over [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]], 2\u20131, over [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], and 2\u20131 over fellow World Cup participant and defending [[Africa Cup of Nations|African]] champions [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]. They were led at the time by [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]], who helped lead West Germany to victory in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] and was the first player to score at least three goals in three consecutive World Cups.\n\nDuring the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the U.S. won their first match against Ghana, 2\u20131. [[Clint Dempsey]] scored in the first minute of the match giving the U.S. the early lead. Ghana did not respond until the 82nd minute scoring the equalizer goal. The U.S. then reclaimed the lead, thanks to [[John Anthony Brooks|John Brooks]] scoring the game-winning goal off his head just four minutes later in the 86th minute to regain the lead and take the match. The U.S. gained three points for their win and was off to a great start in the \"[[Group of Death]]\" claimed by critics for the teams the U.S. would have to go through in [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]] ([[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]).\n\nThe second match of the World Cup for the U.S. was a different story. Portugal claimed the early lead, with [[Nani]] scoring in the 5th minute to take the early 1\u20130 lead. It wasn't till the 64th minute till the U.S. scored the equalizing goal, thanks to [[Jermaine Jones]], tying the match at 1 apiece. The U.S. then claimed the lead on a goal by Clint Dempsey again, scoring in the 81st minute to take a 2\u20131 lead. However, in the final minute of extra time, the world player of the year, [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] drilled a perfect cross to teammate [[Silvestre Varela]] who headed in the tying goal, making the final score 2\u20132. The tie gave each team a point in the overall standings, bringing the U.S. to 4 points total, and gave Portugal their first point of the World Cup having lost their opening match to Germany, 4\u20130. The U.S. claimed a spot in the knockout round in spite of a 1\u20130 loss to eventual champion Germany in their final [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]] game due to them winning the tiebreaker with Portugal. However, they bowed out the tournament in the round of 16 in a 2\u20131 loss to [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group H|Group H]] winner [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. Goalkeeper [[Tim Howard]] helped the U.S. keep a 0\u20130 tie at full time. In extra time, there were two Belgian goals. The U.S. struck back with a goal by 19-year-old phenom [[Julian Green]] but could not manage another goal. [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] was let go after he has been fired as USMNT Director of Coaching and was replaced by Bruce Arena in November 2016.\n\nThe U.S. finished in fifth place in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CONCACAF Fifth Round|Final round]] of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|CONCACAF qualifying]] for the spot of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], which concluded in October 2017.

During their tournament run, the women's national team established a new level of popularity for the women's game, culminating in a final against [[China women's national football team|China]] that drew 90,185 fans, an all-time attendance record for a women's sports event, to a sold-out [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]]. After neither team scored in regulation or extra time, the final went to a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]], which the United States won 5\u20134.

In revenue, 2018 Championship clubs saw a 28% increase over 2017 numbers on an average of ticketing, sponsorship, merchandise, and ancillary revenue generation.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe USLC also holds a broadcast agreement with ESPN that sees 20 regular season games televised nationally on ESPN2, ESPNews and ESPN Deportes<ref>https://www.uslsoccer.com/news_article/show/1044596</ref> in addition to national broadcast of the USL Championship Final, which in 2019 was aired on both ESPN2 and ESPN Deportes. The league's remaining regular season games are broadcast nationally on ESPN+, with 22 of the Championship's clubs also holding local broadcast agreements.

Unlike MLS that is a single-entity operation, the second NASL, like the old NASL, had no salary cap and players were contracted by the individual teams.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nasl.com/media-guide/2011/Media%20Guide_Final_11-07-2011_book.pdf |title=NASL 2011 Media Guide |date=November 7, 2011}}</ref> The season was a split format (similar to that of [[Apertura and Clausura|many leagues in Latin America]]) that features seven teams, including one [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] team.

WPS launched with seven teams, all based in the United States. The Sol folded after the league's inaugural season, and two new teams joined for 2010, bringing WPS to eight teams. However, the 2010 season saw considerable instability, with another charter team, [[Saint Louis Athletica]], folding during the season, champions [[FC Gold Pride]] folding after the season, and the [[Chicago Red Stars]] deciding to regroup in the second-tier [[Women's Premier Soccer League]] (WPSL). The 2011 season, in which six teams based along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] played, was marked by low attendance for most of the season and conflict with [[Dan Borislow]], who had purchased the former [[Washington Freedom]], moved the team to [[Miami metropolitan area|South Florida]], and renamed it [[MagicJack (WPS)|magicJack]]. The dispute between WPS and Borislow led the league to suspend the magicJack franchise, with Borislow responding by suing.

Although Hamilton and Rosberg secured two podium finishes and three consecutive pole position starts within the first five races, the car developed a reputation for being notoriously harsh on its tyres during a time when tyre supplier [[Pirelli]] was faced with heavy criticism for the delicate structure of its tyre compounds, and the narrow operating window, which exacerbated the W04's inherent flaws. This was evidenced in the [[2013 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]] and [[2013 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grands Prix]], where Nico Rosberg qualified on pole for both races, but went on to finish them in ninth and sixth places respectively.\n\nAt the [[2013 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]], the W04 achieved its second front row lockout in as many races (Rosberg and Hamilton locked out the front row in Spain) with [[Nico Rosberg]] on pole and Lewis Hamilton in second. Rosberg went on to win the race, repeating the feat of his father [[Keke Rosberg]] in the [[1983 Monaco Grand Prix|1983 race]], Hamilton finished in fourth.\n\nAt the [[2013 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], Hamilton qualified on pole with Rosberg in second. In the race, Hamilton was comfortably leading, until lap 8, when his car suffered a left-rear tyre failure on the Wellington Straight. [[Felipe Massa]] had a similar tyre failure and a subsequent tyre explosion on [[Jean-\u00c9ric Vergne]]'s car brought out the safety car on lap 16. Rosberg went on to win the race ahead of Red Bull's [[Mark Webber]] by just 0.7 seconds giving Mercedes their second win of the season.\n\nIn [[2013 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]] Hamilton secured his first win for the team after starting on pole position, he managed his tyres without any of the early season trouble he had faced. Rosberg dropped back at the start and retired for the third and final time in the season. [[2013 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]] was next and Hamilton secured his 4th pole position in a row. Sebastian Vettel however was too quick for the Mercedes and he ran away with the race; Hamilton and Rosberg finished 3rd and 4th and kept themselves in 2nd place in the championship.\n\nIndia and Abu Dhabi came as the 2 venues for the team's final podium finishes after difficult races in [[2013 Singapore Grand Prix|Singapore]], [[2013 Korean Grand Prix|Korea]] and [[2013 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]]-where Hamilton suffered his first retirement of the season. Nico Rosberg inherited 2nd place in [[2013 Indian Grand Prix|India]] when Webber retired and he finished 'best of the rest' in 3rd behind the 2 Red Bulls in [[2013 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix|Abu Dhabi]].\n\nIn [[2013 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] Hamilton had been running 4th and on course for the podium but when lapping Valtteri Bottas they touched which left Hamilton with a puncture and a drive through which dropped him out of the points.

Although Hamilton and Rosberg secured two podium finishes and three consecutive pole position starts within the first five races, the car developed a reputation for being notoriously harsh on its tyres during a time when tyre supplier [[Pirelli]] was faced with heavy criticism for the delicate structure of its tyre compounds, and the narrow operating window, which exacerbated the W04's inherent flaws. This was evidenced in the [[2013 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]] and [[2013 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grands Prix]], where Nico Rosberg qualified on pole for both races, but went on to finish them in ninth and sixth places respectively.\n\nAt the [[2013 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]], the W04 achieved its second front row lockout in as many races (Rosberg and Hamilton locked out the front row in Spain) with [[Nico Rosberg]] on pole and Lewis Hamilton in second. Rosberg went on to win the race, repeating the feat of his father [[Keke Rosberg]] in the [[1983 Monaco Grand Prix|1983 race]], Hamilton finished in fourth.\n\nAt the [[2013 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], Hamilton qualified on pole with Rosberg in second. In the race, Hamilton was comfortably leading, until lap 8, when his car suffered a left-rear tyre failure on the Wellington Straight. [[Felipe Massa]] had a similar tyre failure and a subsequent tyre explosion on [[Jean-\u00c9ric Vergne]]'s car brought out the safety car on lap 16. Rosberg went on to win the race ahead of Red Bull's [[Mark Webber]] by just 0.7 seconds giving Mercedes their second win of the season.\n\nIn [[2013 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]] Hamilton secured his first win for the team after starting on pole position, he managed his tyres without any of the early season trouble he had faced. Rosberg dropped back at the start and retired for the third and final time in the season. [[2013 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]] was next and Hamilton secured his 4th pole position in a row. Sebastian Vettel however was too quick for the Mercedes and he ran away with the race; Hamilton and Rosberg finished 3rd and 4th and kept themselves in 2nd place in the championship.\n\nIndia and Abu Dhabi came as the 2 venues for the teams final podium finishes after difficult races in [[2013 Singapore Grand Prix|Singapore]], [[2013 Korean Grand Prix|Korea]] and [[2013 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]]-where Hamilton suffered his first retirement of the season. Nico Rosberg inherited 2nd place in [[2013 Indian Grand Prix|India]] when Webber retired and he finished 'best of the rest' in 3rd behind the 2 Red Bulls in [[2013 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix|Abu Dhabi]].\n\nIn [[2013 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] Hamilton had been running 4th and on course for the podium but when lapping Valtteri Bottas they touched which left Hamilton with a puncture and a drive through which dropped him out of the points. He fought back to 9th and combined with Rosberg's 5th-place finish the team secured 2nd place in the Constructors' Championship, a huge improvement from 5th in 2012.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Complete Formula One results==\n([[:Template:F1 driver results legend 2|key]]) (results in '''bold''' indicate pole position; results in ''italics'' indicate fastest lap)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n|-\n!
