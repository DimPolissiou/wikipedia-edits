This takes place within the story of the Israelites' [[The Exodus|Exodus]] after they escaped Egypt and reached [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mt. Sinai]] (Exodus 19:1). The [[Book of Exodus]] narrates how Moses led the Israelites in building the [[Tabernacle]] (Exodus 35\u201340) with God's instructions (Exodus 25\u201331). Then in Leviticus, God tells the Israelites and their priests how to make offerings in the Tabernacle and how to conduct themselves while camped around the holy tent sanctuary. Leviticus takes place during the month or month-and-a-half between the completion of the Tabernacle (Exodus 40:17) and the Israelites' departure from Sinai (Numbers 1:1, 10:11).\n\nThe instructions of Leviticus emphasize ritual, legal and moral practices rather than beliefs. Nevertheless, they reflect the world view of the creation story in Genesis 1 that God wishes to live with humans. The book teaches that faithful performance of the sanctuary rituals can make that possible, so long as the people avoid [[sin]] and impurity whenever possible. The rituals, especially the sin and guilt offerings, provide the means to gain forgiveness for sins (Leviticus 4\u20135) and [[ritual purification|purification]] from impurities (Leviticus 11\u201316) so that God can continue to live in the Tabernacle in the midst of the people.<ref>Gorman, pp. 4\u20135, 14\u201316</ref>\n\n== Name ==\nThe English name Leviticus comes from the Latin ''Leviticus,'' which is in turn from the [[Biblical Greek|Greek]] \u039b\u03b5\u03c5\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd, ''Leuitikon'', referring to the priestly tribe of the Israelites, \u201cLevi.\u201d The Greek expression is in turn a variant of the [[rabbi]]nic [[Hebrew]] ''torat kohanim'',{{sfn|Berlin|Brettler|2014|p=193}} \"law of priests\", as many of its laws relate to priests.<ref>''[[Hezekiah ben Manoah]]'' (Chizkuni), closing notes to Leviticus</ref>\n\nIn Hebrew the book is called ''Vayikra'' ({{lang-he-n|\u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05bc\u05e7\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0}}), [[incipit|from the opening of the book]], ''va-yikra'' \"And He  <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[God in Judaism|God]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> called.\"{{sfn|Berlin|Brettler|2014|p=193}}\n\n==Structure==\nThe outlines from commentaries are similar, though not identical; compare those of Wenham, Hartley, Milgrom, and Watts.<ref>Wenham, pp. 3\u20134</ref><ref>Hartley, pp. vii\u2013viii</ref><ref>Milgrom (1991), pp. v\u2013x</ref><ref>Watts (2013), pp. 12\u201320</ref>\n\nI.

Chapters 6\u20137 go over much the same ground, but from the point of view of the priest, who, as the one actually carrying out the sacrifice and dividing the \"portions\", needs to know how to do this. Sacrifices are between God, the priest, and the offerers, although in some cases the entire sacrifice is a single portion to God\u2014i.e., burnt to ashes.<ref>Grabbe (2006), p. 208</ref>\n\nChapters 8\u201310 describe how [[Moses]] consecrates [[Aaron]] and his sons as the first priests, the first sacrifices, and God's destruction of two of Aaron's sons for ritual offenses. The purpose is to underline the character of altar priesthood (i.e., those priests with power to offer sacrifices to God) as an [[Kohen|Aaronite]] privilege, and the responsibilities and dangers of their position.<ref name=\"Kugler, Hartin, p.82\">Kugler, Hartin, p. 82</ref>\n\nWith sacrifice and priesthood established, chapters 11\u201315 instruct the lay people on purity (or cleanliness). Eating certain animals produces uncleanliness, as does giving birth; certain skin diseases (but not all) are unclean, as are certain conditions affecting walls and clothing (mildew and similar conditions); and genital discharges, including female menses and male gonorrhea, are unclean. The reasoning behind the food rules are obscure; for the rest the guiding principle seems to be that all these conditions involve a loss of \"life force\", usually but not always blood.<ref>Kugler, Hartin, pp. 82\u201383</ref>\n\nLeviticus 16 concerns the [[Day of Atonement]]. This is the only day on which the High Priest is to enter the holiest part of the sanctuary, the [[holy of holies]]. He is to sacrifice a bull for the sins of the priests, and a goat for the sins of the laypeople. The priest is to send a second goat into the desert to \"[[Azazel]]\", bearing the sins of the whole people. Azazel may be a wilderness-demon, but its identity is mysterious.<ref>Kugler, Hartin, p. 83</ref>\n\nChapters 17\u201326 are the [[Holiness code]]. It begins with a prohibition on all slaughter of animals outside the Temple, even for food, and then prohibits a long list of sexual contacts and also child sacrifice. The \"holiness\" injunctions which give the code its name begin with the next section: there are penalties for the worship of [[Molech]], consulting mediums and wizards, cursing one's parents and engaging in unlawful sex. Priests receive instruction on mourning rituals and acceptable bodily defects. The punishment for blasphemy is death, and there is the setting of rules for eating sacrifices; there is an explanation of the calendar, and there are rules for sabbatical and [[Jubilee (biblical)|Jubilee]] years; there are rules for oil lamps and bread in the sanctuary; and there are rules for [[The Bible and slavery|slavery]].<ref name=\"scripturetext\">{{cite web|url=http://niv.scripturetext.com/leviticus/25.htm|title=Leviticus 25 NIV|publisher=niv.scripturetext.com|accessdate=2014-09-24}}</ref> The code ends by telling the Israelites they must choose between the law and prosperity on the one hand, or, on the other, horrible punishments, the worst of which will be expulsion from the land.<ref>Kugler, Hartin, pp. 83\u201384</ref>\n\nChapter 27 is a disparate and probably late addition telling about persons and things serving as dedication to the Lord and how one can redeem, instead of fulfill, vows.<ref>Kugler, Hartin, p. 84</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n[[Image:Tabernacle Camp.jpg|thumb|The [[Tabernacle]] and the Camp (19th Century drawing)]]\n\nThe majority of scholars have concluded that the Pentateuch received its final form during the Persian period (538\u2013332&nbsp;BC).<ref>Newsom, p.26</ref> Nevertheless, Leviticus had a long period of growth before reaching that form.<ref name=\"Grabbe 1998, p.92\">Grabbe (1998), p. 92</ref>\n\nThe entire composition of the book of Leviticus is [[Priestly source|Priestly]] literature.<ref>Levine (2006), p. 11</ref> Most scholars see chapters 1\u201316 (the [[Priestly code]]) and chapters 17\u201326 (the [[Holiness code]]) as the work of two related schools, but while the Holiness material employs the same technical terms as the Priestly code, it broadens their meaning from pure ritual to the theological and moral, turning the ritual of the Priestly code into a model for the relationship of Israel to God: as the tabernacle, which is apart from uncleanliness, becomes holy by the presence of the Lord, so He will dwell among Israel when Israel receives purification (becomes holy) and separates from other peoples.<ref>Houston, p. 102</ref> The ritual instructions in the Priestly code apparently grew from priests giving instruction and answering questions about ritual matters; the Holiness code (or H) used to be a separate document, later becoming part of Leviticus, but it seems better to think of the Holiness authors as editors who worked with the Priestly code and actually produced Leviticus as we now have it.<ref>Houston, pp. 102\u201303</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\n\n===Sacrifice and ritual===\nMany scholars argue that the rituals of Leviticus have a theological meaning concerning Israel's relationship with its God. [[Jacob Milgrom]] was especially influential in spreading this view. He maintained that the priestly regulations in Leviticus expressed a rational system of theological thought. The writers expected them to be put into practice in Israel's temple, so the rituals would express this theology as well, as well as ethical concern for the poor.<ref>Milgrom (2004), pp. 8\u201316.</ref> Milgrom also argued that the book's purity regulations (chaps. 11\u201315) have a basis in ethical thinking.<ref>Milgrom (1991), pp. 704\u201341.</ref> Many other interpreters have followed Milgrom in exploring the theological and ethical implications of Leviticus's regulations (e.g. Marx, Balentine), though some have questioned how systematic they really are.<ref>Watts (2013), pp. 40\u201354.</ref> Ritual, therefore, is not taking a series of actions for their own sake, but a means of maintaining the relationship between God, the world, and humankind.<ref>Balentine (1999) p. 150</ref>\n\n===Kehuna (Jewish priesthood)===\n{{main|Kohen}}\nThe main function of the priests is service at the altar, and only the sons of [[Aaron]] are priests in the full sense.<ref>Grabbe (2006), p. 211</ref> (Ezekiel also distinguishes between altar-priests and lower Levites, but in Ezekiel the altar-priests are sons of Zadok instead of sons of Aaron; many scholars see this as a remnant of struggles between different priestly factions in First Temple times, finding resolution by the Second Temple into a hierarchy of Aaronite altar-priests and lower-level Levites, including singers, gatekeepers and the like).<ref>Grabbe (2006), p. 211 (fn. 11)</ref>\n\nIn chapter 10, God kills [[Nadab and Abihu]], the oldest sons of Aaron, for offering \"strange incense\". Aaron has two sons left. Commentators have read various messages in the incident: a reflection of struggles between priestly factions in the post\u2013Exilic period (Gerstenberger); or a warning against offering incense outside the Temple, where there might be the risk of invoking strange gods (Milgrom). In any case, there has been a pollution of the sanctuary by the bodies of the two dead priests, leading into the next theme, holiness.<ref>Houston, p. 110</ref>\n\n===Uncleanliness and purity===\nRitual purity is essential for an Israelite to be able to approach Yahweh and remain part of the community.<ref name=\"Kugler, Hartin, p.82\"/> Uncleanliness threatens holiness;<ref>Davies, Rogerson, p. 101</ref>  Chapters 11\u201315 review the various causes of uncleanliness and describe the rituals which will restore cleanliness;<ref>Marx, p. 104</ref> one is to maintain cleanliness through observation of the rules on sexual behaviour, family relations, land ownership, worship, sacrifice, and observance of holy days.<ref name=\"Balentine 2002, p.8\">Balentine (2002), p. 8</ref>\n\n[[Yahweh]] dwells with Israel in the holy of holies. All of the priestly ritual focuses on Yahweh and the construction and maintenance of a holy space, but sin generates impurity, as do everyday events such as childbirth and [[menstruation]]; impurity pollutes the holy dwelling place. Failure to ritually purify the sacred space could result in God leaving, which would be disastrous.<ref>Gorman, pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\n===Atonement===\n[[File:William Holman Hunt - The Scapegoat.jpg|thumb|''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'' (1854 painting by [[William Holman Hunt]])]]\nThrough sacrifice, the priest \"makes atonement\" for sin and the offerer receives forgiveness (but only if God accepts the sacrifice\u2014forgiveness comes only from God).<ref>Houston, p. 106</ref> Atonement rituals involve the pouring or sprinkling of blood as the symbol of the life of the victim: the blood has the power to wipe out or absorb the sin.<ref name=\"Houston107\">Houston, p. 107</ref> The two-part division of the book structurally reflects the role of atonement: chapters 1\u201316 call for the establishment of the institution for atonement, and chapters 17\u201327 call for the life of the atoned community in holiness.<ref>Knierim, p. 114</ref>\n\n===Holiness===\nThe consistent theme of chapters 17\u201326 is in the repetition of the phrase, \"Be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.\"<ref name=\"Balentine 2002, p.8\"/> Holiness in ancient Israel had a different meaning than in contemporary usage: it might have been regarded as the \"god-ness\" of God, an invisible but physical and potentially dangerous force.<ref>Rodd, p. 7</ref> Specific objects, or even days, can be holy, but they derive holiness from being connected with God\u2014the seventh day, the tabernacle, and the priests all derive their holiness from God.<ref>Brueggemann, p. 99</ref> As a result, Israel had to maintain its own holiness in order to live safely alongside God.<ref>Rodd, p. 8</ref>\n\nThe need for holiness is for the possession of the Promised Land ([[Canaan]]), where the Jews will become a holy people: \"You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt where you dwelt, and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan to which I am bringing you...You shall do my ordinances and keep my statutes...I am the Lord, your God\" (ch. 18:3).<ref>Clines, p.56</ref>\n\n== Subsequent tradition ==\n[[File:Temple Scroll.png|thumb|Portion of the [[Temple Scroll]]]]\n\nLeviticus, as part of the Torah, became the law book of Jerusalem's [[Second Temple]] as well as of the Samaritan temple. Evidence of its influence is evident among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], which included fragments of seventeen manuscripts of Leviticus dating from the third to the first centuries BC.<ref>Watts (2013), p. 10</ref> Many other Qumran scrolls cite the book, especially the [[Temple Scroll]] and [[4QMMT]].\n\nJews and Christians have not observed Leviticus's instructions for animal offerings since the first century AD. Because of the destruction of the [[temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 AD, Jewish worship has focused on prayer and the study of Torah. Nevertheless, Leviticus constitutes a major source of [[Jewish law]] and is traditionally the first book children learn in the Rabbinic system of education. There are two main [[Midrash]]im on Leviticus\u2014the [[Halakha|halakhic one]] (Sifra) and a more [[aggada|aggadic]] one ([[Vayikra Rabbah]]).\n\nThe [[New Testament]], particularly the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], uses ideas and images from Leviticus to describe Christ as the high priest who offers his own blood as a [[sin offering]].<ref name=\"Houston107\"/> Therefore, Christians do not make animal offerings either, as Gordon Wenham summarized: \"With the death of Christ the only sufficient \"burnt offering\" was offered once and for all, and therefore the animal sacrifices which foreshadowed Christ's sacrifice were made obsolete.\"<ref>Wenham, p. 65</ref>\n\nChristians generally [[Christian views on the old covenant|have the view]] that the [[New Covenant]] [[Supersessionism|supersedes]] (i.e., replaces) the Old Testament's [[Law of Moses|ritual laws]], which includes many of the rules in Leviticus. Christians therefore have usually not observed Leviticus' rules regarding diet, purity, and agriculture. Christian teachings have differed, however, as to where to draw the line between ritual and moral regulations.<ref>Watts (2013), pp.&nbsp;77\u201386</ref>\n\n== Contents according to Judaism's weekly Torah portions ==\n[[File:YanovTorah.JPG|thumb|right|A Torah scroll and silver pointer (''[[yad]]'') used in reading.]]\n{{main|Weekly Torah portion}}\n\n:For detailed contents see:\n:* ''[[Vayikra (parsha)|Vayikra]]'', on Leviticus 1\u20135: Laws of the sacrifices\n:* ''[[Tzav (parsha)|Tzav]]'', on Leviticus 6\u20138: Sacrifices, ordination of the priests\n:* ''[[Shemini (parsha)|Shemini]]'', on Leviticus 9\u201311: Concecration of tabernacle, alien fire, dietary laws\n:* ''[[Tazria (parsha)|Tazria]]'', on Leviticus 12\u201313: Childbirth, skin disease, clothing\n:* ''[[Metzora (parsha)|Metzora]]'', on Leviticus 14\u201315: Skin disease, unclean houses, genital discharges\n:* ''[[Acharei Mot (parsha)|Acharei Mot]]'', on Leviticus 16\u2013[[Leviticus 18|18]]: Yom Kippur, centralized offerings, sexual practices\n:* ''[[Kedoshim (parsha)|Kedoshim]]'', on [[Leviticus 19]]\u201320: Holiness, penalties for transgressions\n:* ''[[Emor (parsha)|Emor]]'', on Leviticus 21\u201324: Rules for priests, holy days, lights and bread, a blasphemer\n:* ''[[Behar (parsha)|Behar]]'', on Leviticus 25\u201325: Sabbatical year, debt servitude limited\n:* ''[[Bechukotai (parsha)|Bechukotai]]'', on Leviticus 26\u201327: Blessings and curses, payment of vows\n\n==See also==\n* [[613 commandments]]\n* [[En-Gedi Scroll]]\n* [[Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus scroll]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Translations of Leviticus===\n*[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+1&version=NIV Leviticus] at Bible gateway\n\n===Commentaries on Leviticus===\n*{{Cite book|last=Balentine|first=Samuel E|title=Leviticus|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A399uVxU_RUC |isbn=9780664237356}}\n*[[Bernard Jacob Bamberger|Bamberger, Bernard Jacob]] The Torah: A Modern Commentary (1981), {{ISBN|0-8074-0055-6}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Gerstenberger|first=Erhard S|title=Leviticus: A Commentary|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xs258sZfcUC |isbn=9780664226732}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Gorman|first=Frank H|title=Divine Presence and Community: A Commentary on the Book of Leviticus|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwSMl8od4yAC |isbn=9780802801104}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Grabbe|first=Lester|chapter=Leviticus|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCRYl9Ikk6EC&pg=PA105|editor=John Barton|title=Oxford Bible Commentary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=9780198755005|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordbiblecomme0000unse}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Hartley|first1=John E.|title=Leviticus|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PgovQQAACAAJ |date=1992|publisher=Word|isbn=0849902037}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Houston|first=Walter J|chapter=Leviticus|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Vo-11umIZQC&pg=PA101 |editor=James D.

This takes place within the story of the Israelites' [[The Exodus|Exodus]] after they escaped Egypt and reached [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mt. Sinai]] (Exodus 19:1). The [[Book of Exodus]] narrates how Moses led the Israelites in building the [[Tabernacle]] (Exodus 35\u201340) with God's instructions (Exodus 25\u201331). Then in Leviticus, God tells the Israelites and their priests how to make offerings in the Tabernacle and how to conduct themselves while camped around the holy tent sanctuary. Leviticus takes place during the month or month-and-a-half between the completion of the Tabernacle (Exodus 40:17) and the Israelites' departure from Sinai (Numbers 1:1, 10:11).\n\nThe instructions of Leviticus emphasize ritual, legal and moral practices rather than beliefs. Nevertheless, they reflect the world view of the creation story in Genesis 1 that God wishes to live with humans. The book teaches that faithful performance of the sanctuary rituals can make that possible, so long as the people avoid [[sin]] and impurity whenever possible. The rituals, especially the sin and guilt offerings, provide the means to gain forgiveness for sins (Leviticus 4\u20135) and [[ritual purification|purification]] from impurities (Leviticus 11\u201316) so that God can continue to live in the Tabernacle in the midst of the people.<ref>Gorman, pp. 4\u20135, 14\u201316</ref>\n\n== Name ==\nThe English name Leviticus comes from the Latin ''Leviticus,'' which is in turn from the [[Biblical Greek|Greek]] \u039b\u03b5\u03c5\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd, ''Leuitikon'', referring to the priestly tribe of the Israelites, \u201cLevi.\u201d The Greek expression is in turn a variant of the [[rabbi]]nic [[Hebrew]] ''torat kohanim'',{{sfn|Berlin|Brettler|2014|p=193}} \"law of priests\", as many of its laws relate to priests.<ref>''[[Hezekiah ben Manoah]]'' (Chizkuni), closing notes to Leviticus</ref>\n\nIn Hebrew the book is called ''Vayikra'' ({{lang-he-n|\u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05bc\u05e7\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0}}), [[incipit|from the opening of the book]], ''va-yikra'' \"And He  <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[God in Judaism|God]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> called.\"{{sfn|Berlin|Brettler|2014|p=193}}\n\n==Structure==\nThe outlines from commentaries are similar, though not identical; compare those of Wenham, Hartley, Milgrom, and Watts.<ref>Wenham, pp. 3\u20134</ref><ref>Hartley, pp. vii\u2013viii</ref><ref>Milgrom (1991), pp. v\u2013x</ref><ref>Watts (2013), pp. 12\u201320</ref>\n\nI.

Chapters 6\u20137 go over much the same ground, but from the point of view of the priest, who, as the one actually carrying out the sacrifice and dividing the \"portions\", needs to know how to do this. Sacrifices are between God, the priest, and the offerers, although in some cases the entire sacrifice is a single portion to God\u2014i.e., burnt to ashes.<ref>Grabbe (2006), p. 208</ref>\n\nChapters 8\u201310 describe how [[Moses]] consecrates [[Aaron]] and his sons as the first priests, the first sacrifices, and God's destruction of two of Aaron's sons for ritual offenses. The purpose is to underline the character of altar priesthood (i.e., those priests with power to offer sacrifices to God) as an [[Kohen|Aaronite]] privilege, and the responsibilities and dangers of their position.<ref name=\"Kugler, Hartin, p.82\">Kugler, Hartin, p. 82</ref>\n\nWith sacrifice and priesthood established, chapters 11\u201315 instruct the lay people on purity (or cleanliness). Eating certain animals produces uncleanliness, as does giving birth; certain skin diseases (but not all) are unclean, as are certain conditions affecting walls and clothing (mildew and similar conditions); and genital discharges, including female menses and male gonorrhea, are unclean. The reasoning behind the food rules are obscure; for the rest the guiding principle seems to be that all these conditions involve a loss of \"life force\", usually but not always blood.<ref>Kugler, Hartin, pp. 82\u201383</ref>\n\nLeviticus 16 concerns the [[Day of Atonement]]. This is the only day on which the High Priest is to enter the holiest part of the sanctuary, the [[holy of holies]]. He is to sacrifice a bull for the sins of the priests, and a goat for the sins of the laypeople. The priest is to send a second goat into the desert to \"[[Azazel]]\", bearing the sins of the whole people. Azazel may be a wilderness-demon, but its identity is mysterious.<ref>Kugler, Hartin, p. 83</ref>\n\nChapters 17\u201326 are the [[Holiness code]]. It begins with a prohibition on all slaughter of animals outside the Temple, even for food, and then prohibits a long list of sexual contacts and also child sacrifice. The \"holiness\" injunctions which give the code its name begin with the next section: there are penalties for the worship of [[Molech]], consulting mediums and wizards, cursing one's parents and engaging in unlawful sex. Priests receive instruction on mourning rituals and acceptable bodily defects. The punishment for blasphemy is death, and there is the setting of rules for eating sacrifices; there is an explanation of the calendar, and there are rules for sabbatical and [[Jubilee (biblical)|Jubilee]] years; there are rules for oil lamps and bread in the sanctuary; and there are rules for [[The Bible and slavery|slavery]].<ref name=\"scripturetext\">{{cite web|url=http://niv.scripturetext.com/leviticus/25.htm|title=Leviticus 25 NIV|publisher=niv.scripturetext.com|accessdate=2014-09-24}}</ref> The code ends by telling the Israelites they must choose between the law and prosperity on the one hand, or, on the other, horrible punishments, the worst of which will be expulsion from the land.<ref>Kugler, Hartin, pp. 83\u201384</ref>\n\nChapter 27 is a disparate and probably late addition telling about persons and things serving as dedication to the Lord and how one can redeem, instead of fulfill, vows.<ref>Kugler, Hartin, p. 84</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n[[Image:Tabernacle Camp.jpg|thumb|The [[Tabernacle]] and the Camp (19th Century drawing)]]\n\nThe majority of scholars have concluded that the Pentateuch received its final form during the Persian period (538\u2013332&nbsp;BC).<ref>Newsom, p.26</ref> Nevertheless, Leviticus had a long period of growth before reaching that form.<ref name=\"Grabbe 1998, p.92\">Grabbe (1998), p. 92</ref>\n\nThe entire composition of the book of Leviticus is [[Priestly source|Priestly]] literature.<ref>Levine (2006), p. 11</ref> Most scholars see chapters 1\u201316 (the [[Priestly code]]) and chapters 17\u201326 (the [[Holiness code]]) as the work of two related schools, but while the Holiness material employs the same technical terms as the Priestly code, it broadens their meaning from pure ritual to the theological and moral, turning the ritual of the Priestly code into a model for the relationship of Israel to God: as the tabernacle, which is apart from uncleanliness, becomes holy by the presence of the Lord, so He will dwell among Israel when Israel receives purification (becomes holy) and separates from other peoples.<ref>Houston, p. 102</ref> The ritual instructions in the Priestly code apparently grew from priests giving instruction and answering questions about ritual matters; the Holiness code (or H) used to be a separate document, later becoming part of Leviticus, but it seems better to think of the Holiness authors as editors who worked with the Priestly code and actually produced Leviticus as we now have it.<ref>Houston, pp. 102\u201303</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\n\n===Sacrifice and ritual===\nMany scholars argue that the rituals of Leviticus have a theological meaning concerning Israel's relationship with its God. [[Jacob Milgrom]] was especially influential in spreading this view. He maintained that the priestly regulations in Leviticus expressed a rational system of theological thought. The writers expected them to be put into practice in Israel's temple, so the rituals would express this theology as well, as well as ethical concern for the poor.<ref>Milgrom (2004), pp. 8\u201316.</ref> Milgrom also argued that the book's purity regulations (chaps. 11\u201315) have a basis in ethical thinking.<ref>Milgrom (1991), pp. 704\u201341.</ref> Many other interpreters have followed Milgrom in exploring the theological and ethical implications of Leviticus's regulations (e.g. Marx, Balentine), though some have questioned how systematic they really are.<ref>Watts (2013), pp. 40\u201354.</ref> Ritual, therefore, is not taking a series of actions for their own sake, but a means of maintaining the relationship between God, the world, and humankind.<ref>Balentine (1999) p. 150</ref>\n\n===Kehuna (Jewish priesthood)===\n{{main|Kohen}}\nThe main function of the priests is service at the altar, and only the sons of [[Aaron]] are priests in the full sense.<ref>Grabbe (2006), p. 211</ref> (Ezekiel also distinguishes between altar-priests and lower Levites, but in Ezekiel the altar-priests are sons of Zadok instead of sons of Aaron; many scholars see this as a remnant of struggles between different priestly factions in First Temple times, finding resolution by the Second Temple into a hierarchy of Aaronite altar-priests and lower-level Levites, including singers, gatekeepers and the like).<ref>Grabbe (2006), p. 211 (fn. 11)</ref>\n\nIn chapter 10, God kills [[Nadab and Abihu]], the oldest sons of Aaron, for offering \"strange incense\". Aaron has two sons left. Commentators have read various messages in the incident: a reflection of struggles between priestly factions in the post\u2013Exilic period (Gerstenberger); or a warning against offering incense outside the Temple, where there might be the risk of invoking strange gods (Milgrom). In any case, there has been a pollution of the sanctuary by the bodies of the two dead priests, leading into the next theme, holiness.<ref>Houston, p. 110</ref>\n\n===Uncleanliness and purity===\nRitual purity is essential for an Israelite to be able to approach Yahweh and remain part of the community.<ref name=\"Kugler, Hartin, p.82\"/> Uncleanliness threatens holiness;<ref>Davies, Rogerson, p. 101</ref>  Chapters 11\u201315 review the various causes of uncleanliness and describe the rituals which will restore cleanliness;<ref>Marx, p. 104</ref> one is to maintain cleanliness through observation of the rules on sexual behaviour, family relations, land ownership, worship, sacrifice, and observance of holy days.<ref name=\"Balentine 2002, p.8\">Balentine (2002), p. 8</ref>\n\n[[Yahweh]] dwells with Israel in the holy of holies. All of the priestly ritual focuses on Yahweh and the construction and maintenance of a holy space, but sin generates impurity, as do everyday events such as childbirth and [[menstruation]]; impurity pollutes the holy dwelling place. Failure to ritually purify the sacred space could result in God leaving, which would be disastrous.<ref>Gorman, pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\n===Atonement===\n[[File:William Holman Hunt - The Scapegoat.jpg|thumb|''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'' (1854 painting by [[William Holman Hunt]])]]\nThrough sacrifice, the priest \"makes atonement\" for sin and the offerer receives forgiveness (but only if God accepts the sacrifice\u2014forgiveness comes only from God).<ref>Houston, p. 106</ref> Atonement rituals involve the pouring or sprinkling of blood as the symbol of the life of the victim: the blood has the power to wipe out or absorb the sin.<ref name=\"Houston107\">Houston, p. 107</ref> The two-part division of the book structurally reflects the role of atonement: chapters 1\u201316 call for the establishment of the institution for atonement, and chapters 17\u201327 call for the life of the atoned community in holiness.<ref>Knierim, p. 114</ref>\n\n===Holiness===\nThe consistent theme of chapters 17\u201326 is in the repetition of the phrase, \"Be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.\"<ref name=\"Balentine 2002, p.8\"/> Holiness in ancient Israel had a different meaning than in contemporary usage: it might have been regarded as the \"god-ness\" of God, an invisible but physical and potentially dangerous force.<ref>Rodd, p. 7</ref> Specific objects, or even days, can be holy, but they derive holiness from being connected with God\u2014the seventh day, the tabernacle, and the priests all derive their holiness from God.<ref>Brueggemann, p. 99</ref> As a result, Israel had to maintain its own holiness in order to live safely alongside God.<ref>Rodd, p. 8</ref>\n\nThe need for holiness is for the possession of the Promised Land ([[Canaan]]), where the Jews will become a holy people: \"You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt where you dwelt, and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan to which I am bringing you...You shall do my ordinances and keep my statutes...I am the Lord, your God\" (ch. 18:3).<ref>Clines, p.56</ref>\n\n== Subsequent tradition ==\n[[File:Temple Scroll.png|thumb|Portion of the [[Temple Scroll]]]]\n\nLeviticus, as part of the Torah, became the law book of Jerusalem's [[Second Temple]] as well as of the Samaritan temple. Evidence of its influence is evident among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], which included fragments of seventeen manuscripts of Leviticus dating from the third to the first centuries BC.<ref>Watts (2013), p. 10</ref> Many other Qumran scrolls cite the book, especially the [[Temple Scroll]] and [[4QMMT]].\n\nJews and Christians have not observed Leviticus's instructions for animal offerings since the first century AD. Because of the destruction of the [[temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 AD, Jewish worship has focused on prayer and the study of Torah. Nevertheless, Leviticus constitutes a major source of [[Jewish law]] and is traditionally the first book children learn in the Rabbinic system of education. There are two main [[Midrash]]im on Leviticus\u2014the [[Halakha|halakhic one]] (Sifra) and a more [[aggada|aggadic]] one ([[Vayikra Rabbah]]).\n\nThe [[New Testament]], particularly the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], uses ideas and images from Leviticus to describe Christ as the high priest who offers his own blood as a [[sin offering]].<ref name=\"Houston107\"/> Therefore, Christians do not make animal offerings either, as Gordon Wenham summarized: \"With the death of Christ the only sufficient \"burnt offering\" was offered once and for all, and therefore the animal sacrifices which foreshadowed Christ's sacrifice were made obsolete.\"<ref>Wenham, p. 65</ref>\n\nChristians generally [[Christian views on the old covenant|have the view]] that the [[New Covenant]] [[Supersessionism|supersedes]] (i.e., replaces) the Old Testament's [[Law of Moses|ritual laws]], which includes many of the rules in Leviticus. Christians therefore have usually not observed Leviticus' rules regarding diet, purity, and agriculture. Christian teachings have differed, however, as to where to draw the line between ritual and moral regulations.<ref>Watts (2013), pp.&nbsp;77\u201386</ref>\n\n== Contents according to Judaism's weekly Torah portions ==\n[[File:YanovTorah.JPG|thumb|right|A Torah scroll and silver pointer (''[[yad]]'') used in reading.]]\n{{main|Weekly Torah portion}}\n\n:For detailed contents see:\n:* ''[[Vayikra (parsha)|Vayikra]]'', on Leviticus 1\u20135: Laws of the sacrifices\n:* ''[[Tzav (parsha)|Tzav]]'', on Leviticus 6\u20138: Sacrifices, ordination of the priests\n:* ''[[Shemini (parsha)|Shemini]]'', on Leviticus 9\u201311: Concecration of tabernacle, alien fire, dietary laws\n:* ''[[Tazria (parsha)|Tazria]]'', on Leviticus 12\u201313: Childbirth, skin disease, clothing\n:* ''[[Metzora (parsha)|Metzora]]'', on Leviticus 14\u201315: Skin disease, unclean houses, genital discharges\n:* ''[[Acharei Mot (parsha)|Acharei Mot]]'', on Leviticus 16\u2013[[Leviticus 18|18]]: Yom Kippur, centralized offerings, sexual practices\n:* ''[[Kedoshim (parsha)|Kedoshim]]'', on [[Leviticus 19]]\u201320: Holiness, penalties for transgressions\n:* ''[[Emor (parsha)|Emor]]'', on Leviticus 21\u201324: Rules for priests, holy days, lights and bread, a blasphemer\n:* ''[[Behar (parsha)|Behar]]'', on Leviticus 25\u201325: Sabbatical year, debt servitude limited\n:* ''[[Bechukotai (parsha)|Bechukotai]]'', on Leviticus 26\u201327: Blessings and curses, payment of vows\n\n==See also==\n* [[613 commandments]]\n* [[En-Gedi Scroll]]\n* [[Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus scroll]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Translations of Leviticus===\n*[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+1&version=NIV Leviticus] at Bible gateway\n\n===Commentaries on Leviticus===\n*{{Cite book|last=Balentine|first=Samuel E|title=Leviticus|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A399uVxU_RUC |isbn=9780664237356}}\n*[[Bernard Jacob Bamberger|Bamberger, Bernard Jacob]] The Torah: A Modern Commentary (1981), {{ISBN|0-8074-0055-6}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Gerstenberger|first=Erhard S|title=Leviticus: A Commentary|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xs258sZfcUC |isbn=9780664226732}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Gorman|first=Frank H|title=Divine Presence and Community: A Commentary on the Book of Leviticus|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwSMl8od4yAC |isbn=9780802801104}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Grabbe|first=Lester|chapter=Leviticus|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCRYl9Ikk6EC&pg=PA105|editor=John Barton|title=Oxford Bible Commentary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=9780198755005|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordbiblecomme0000unse}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Hartley|first1=John E.|title=Leviticus|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PgovQQAACAAJ |date=1992|publisher=Word|isbn=0849902037}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Houston|first=Walter J|chapter=Leviticus|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Vo-11umIZQC&pg=PA101 |editor=James D.

Their goal was to build a new entertainment and sports venue in [[downtown Winnipeg]] to help revive the city's downtown area and possibly one day bring an NHL franchise back to Winnipeg following the departure of the original [[Winnipeg Jets (1972-96)|Winnipeg Jets]] franchise to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1996.<ref name=\"cbc2\">{{cite news|title=Winnipeg Jets deal: the investors who made it happen|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/story/2011/05/31/f-jets-investors-bios.html|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=May 31, 2011|accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"sportsnet3\">{{cite news|title=Chipman's plight to return the NHL to Winnipeg|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2011/05/31/chipman_winnipeg/|publisher=[[Rogers Sportsnet]]|date=May 31, 2011|accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> Ownership of the Moose was transferred to TNSE in 2003.<ref name=\"TNSE\">{{cite news|title=MTS Centre: Quick Facts|url=http://mtscentre.ca/arena/index.php|publisher=www.mtscentre.ca|accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe 15,321-seat [[Bell MTS Place]] (formerly the MTS Centre) was completed in fall 2004 and became the new home of the Moose, replacing the [[Winnipeg Arena]]. The arena was built at a cost of $133.5 million on land acquired from [[Osmington Incorporated]], a real estate firm owned by Toronto billionaire [[David Thomson, 3rd Baron Thomson of Fleet|David Thomson]]. In exchange for the land, Osmington took a minority share in TNSE.

As a result, the Moose were relocated to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] for the 2011\u201312 season and rebranded as the [[St. John's IceCaps]], and became the top minor league affiliate of the Jets.<ref name=\"cbc1\" /><ref name=\"tsn\">{{cite news|title=AHL APPROVES MOVE OF MANITOBA MOOSE TO ST.

As the league was not prepared to cover the team's losses for another season, the league executive reached a tentative agreement to sell the Coyotes to TNSE, allowing them to relocate the franchise back to Winnipeg.  This was intended as a back-up plan, as the league's first choice was to keep the team in Arizona.  With no other investors in place, the league asked the [[Glendale, Arizona|City of Glendale]] to cover the Coyotes losses for the 2010\u201311 season.  Facing a tight deadline, city council voted in favor of the deal rather than risk losing the primary tenant of their arena.<ref name=\"ts\" />  According to Chipman, TNSE came \"within ten minutes of acquiring (the Coyotes)\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Winnipeg came within 10 minutes of getting the Coyotes |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/we-missed-it-by-that-much-in-2010-124057719.html|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter a failed bid to sell the team to Matthew Hulziser, the NHL and TNSE resumed their negotiations in spring of 2011.  Glendale city council decided to cover the team's losses for another year, so TNSE shifted their focus on another opportunity\u2014to acquire the Atlanta Thrashers from the [[Atlanta Spirit, LLC|Atlanta Spirit group]]. On the morning of May 31, 2011, the sale was finalized and announced at a press conference held at the MTS Centre.
