{"title_page": "Pope Pius XI and Spain", "text_new": "\n\nForeign relations between [[Pope Pius XI]] and [[Spain]] were very tense, especially because they occurred within the context of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the period of troubles preceding it.\n\n==Anti-clerical government==\nThe Republican government which came to power in Spain in 1931, as the country embraced constitutional democracy, following the fall of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and the exit of the King, [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], seemed to signal that Spain was breaking with elements of its past. The Republican alliance took 45 of Spain's 52 provincial capitals.<ref>Mary Vincent, p.117</ref> The Republican alliance perceived the religious question at this time as a matter of trying to define a new, subordinate place of the Catholic Church. Many of the constitutional articles were modeled on the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Portuguese Constitution of 1911]] \u2013 separation of church and state; freedom of worship became a fundamental civic right; civil marriage and divorce were introduced; schools and cemeteries were secularized. Catholic schools continued, but outside the state system, and in 1933 further legislation banned all [[Religious sister (Catholic)|religious sisters]] and male congregations from teaching. ''State education would be secular, obligatory, free of charge, and available to all.''<ref>Mary Vincent, Spain 1833\u20132002, p.122</ref> Also, the [[Jesuit]]s were expelled from Spain. \n\nReligion was to be placed in the private sphere, religious worship confined to religious buildings \u2013 the public world of the Republic was to be determinedly secular. Establishing a secular state was a fundamental tenet of Republicanism, but the alliance was 'a hybrid of traditions', encompassing liberals, radicals, federalists, anarchists \u2013 and there was less unanimity as to other anti-religious policies. The Socialist minister of justice [[w:es:Fernando de los Rios|Fernando de los Rios]], argued that the deputies should not deprive communities of their traditional festivities and that processions like [[Holy Week in Seville]] or [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] transcended a purely religious significance \u2013 but was ignored.<ref>Vincent, p.122</ref> At [[Pentecost]] in 1932, Pope Pius XI protested against these measures and demanded [[restitution]]. He asked the Catholics of Spain to fight with all legal means against the perceived injustices.\n\n==Nationalization of Church properties==\nOn 3 June 1933, Pius issued the encyclical [[Dilectissima Nobis|''Dilectissima Nobis'']], in which he described the expropriation of all Church buildings, episcopal residences, parish houses, seminaries and monasteries. By law, they were now property of the Spanish State, to which the Church had to pay rent and taxes in order to continuously use these properties. \"Thus the Catholic Church is compelled to pay taxes on what was violently taken from her.\"<ref>Dilectissima Nobis,  9\u201310</ref> Religious vestments, liturgical instruments, statues, pictures, vases, gems and similar objects necessary for worship were expropriated as well.<ref>Dilectissima Nobis, 12</ref>\n\n==Expropriation of private Catholic schools==\nThe churches were not spared in the expropriation. Numerous churches and temples were destroyed by burning, after they were nationalized. Jesuits were prohibited from teaching. Private Catholic schools of Religious Orders and Congregations were expropriated, without regard to the free will of founders and benefactors. The purpose was to create solely secular schools.<ref>Dilectissima Nobis, 21</ref>\n\n==Beginning of the Civil War==\nThe Civil War in Spain started in 1936, during which thousands of churches were destroyed and thirteen bishops and some 7000 clergy and religious Spaniards were assassinated.<ref>Franzen  397</ref> Another estimate is that in the course of the Red Terror, 6,832&nbsp;members of the Catholic clergy were killed.<ref name=\"Cueva 355\">{{Harvnb|de la Cueva|1998|p=355}}</ref> Though many right-wing Catholics, including the majority of bishops, had always been opposed to the Republic and \" bore a considerable responsibility for the growing friction that culminated in open warfare\", the wave of persecution of religion that swept across the Republican zone, where the rebellion had failed, during the first months of the war, helped to assure \"Franco of the highly useful support of the ecclesiastical establishment throughout the whole of the Civil War.\"<ref>Raguer, Gunpowder and Incense, p.51</ref> ([[Isidro Goma y Tomas]] for example, handed money, collected from Ireland for the reconstruction of churches and replacement of liturgical articles, to Franco's rebel army.)<ref>Raguer, p.74</ref>\n\n==The speech at Castelgandolfo, 14 September 1936==\nIn the first bloody months of the Civil War some ecclesiastics managed to escape to [[Marseilles]], [[Genoa]], or Rome and these brought news reports with them, with which they sought to apply pressure to the organs of the Vatican Curia with whom they maintained regular relations. (Hilari Raguer, a [[Benedictines]] writer on religious history, points out that they necessarily delivered a biased report \u2013 bishops and aristocrats carry more weight than peasants and workers \u2013 and poor workers had no means of escape to take them from the Francoist zone to Rome). [[Wlodimir Ledochowski|Father Ledochowski]], the superior general of the Jesuits, ordered the Jesuit press all over the world to support the rebels. It became known that Pius XI would grant an audience, at his summer residence at [[Castelgandolfo]], to a large group of Spanish refugees and deliver an address to them. Expectation rose amongst the Spanish clergy in Rome. Though it should have fallen to Cardinal [[Francisco Vidal y Barraquer]] to lead the group of Spanish clergy, there was great animosity to him from the majority of Spanish ecclesiastics and the Pope instructed him to say he judged it wiser not to attend. Some 500 Spaniards, mostly priests and religious, as well as some secular supporters of the Uprising, did attend. The content of the speech disappointed the more fanatical among the supporters of the military rising. He read it in Italian and a Spanish translation was distributed as a leaflet. Entitled ''La vostra presenza'' (Your Presence Here), it began with lamentation for the fate of the victims and condemned communism. This part of the speech was used from this point on in Francoist propaganda. He quoted from the [[Book of Revelation]], telling the refugees they ''came out of great tribulation'' (Rev. 7, 14). Yet whilst some hoped and expected that the Insurgent cause would be declared a Holy War or Crusade \u2013 it had already been so designated by various bishops and generals \u2013 Pius XI expressed horror at fratricidal war and exhorted the insurgents to love their enemies. He thanked those who had tried to alleviate the miseries of war, though their effect had been minimal. This too may have displeased the fervent supporters of Franco who were present, for the insurgents had always obstructed intervention of this kind by governments or neutral organisations such as the [[International Red Cross]]<ref>Raguer, p.83</ref>\n\n==Reactions to Pius XI's Castelgandolfo speech==\nFour days after the speech [[Eugenio Pacelli]] wrote to Vidal y Barraquer to say the Pope had wanted to comfort the refugees but not to identify himself with the warlike attitude of the side that called itself Catholic. In the so-called 'National' zone however, the Francoists widely publicized the speech - but only those paragraphs which seemed to endorse the idea of a Crusade, the second part being suppressed. The Spanish bishops acted upon the impulse suggested by the propagandist version of the speech and \"let loose a cascade of Pastoral Letters in favour of Franco.\"<ref>Raguer, p.85</ref> So, for example, [[Enrique Pla y Deniel]], the [[Bishop of Salamanca]], on receiving a version of Pius XI's speech from the military, published his Pastoral Letter, ''Las Dos ciudades'',(''The Two cities''), dated 30 September, an attempt at a theological justification for Franco's cause. The moral weight of the Vatican was considered of great significance to the generals of the Uprising\u2014for one thing it was wanted at this time to aid the suppression of the separatist nationalisms in Spain. In 1936 it was [[Basque people|Basque]] nationalism which particularly troubled the Francoists as it presented to the world the sight of Catholics who were loyal to the Republic and resisting with arms the invasion of the ''Crusaders''.<ref>Raguer, p.86</ref>\n\n==Magaz, Goma, and Pius XI==\nThe [[Holy See]] maintained relations with the Republic in 1936\u2014thereafter they grew weaker. Relations began with [[Burgos]], the base of Franco's Nationalists, with the appointment of an unofficial Charg\u00e9. The Junta de Defensa at Burgos appointed a monarchist, Antonio de Magaz y Pers, the [[w:es:Marquesado de Magaz|Marqu\u00e9s de Magaz]] to establish contact with the Vatican. Magaz had been ambassador to the Holy See in the late 1920s and had sought to enrol the assistance of Pius XI in the suppression of ''catalanismo'' and ''bizcaitarrismo'' (Catalan and Basque nationalism)\u2014and the removal of Cardinal Vidal y Barraquer from the Primatial Archiepiscopal seat of [[Tarragona]]. Magaz did not succeed in removing the Catalan cardinal but did get decrees prohibiting the use of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] in pastoral matters and ordering the expulsion from the seminaries of all teachers and pupils suspected of separatism.<ref>Raguer, p.88</ref>\n\nMagaz's second mission to the Vatican in 1936 lasted barely a year. He endlessly demanded the canonical condemnation of the Basque nationalists, who refused to surrender to the rebels. He made complaints and threats against what he called the ''neutralism'' of the Vatican in the face of a war of religion. Pius XI met Magaz in a papal audience on 23 November 1936. Pius XI had just received a report from the Bishop of [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], [[w:es:Mateo Mugica|Mateo Mugica Urresterazu]], telling him how the Franco insurgents had expelled him from his seat and telling him that 14 priests of his diocese had been shot, and many more jailed or banished from their parishes. According to a report of J.A. Gimenez Arnau, who asked Magaz about the audience, Magaz told him Pius XI replied to his complaints about the Vatican's attitude to the Nationalist authorities by declaring; \" In the National Spain, priests are shot just as they are in the Spain of the other side.\" In another account, when Magaz said that the slight sympathy for the National government of the Pope's words caused him great distress, Pius XI was thrown into a fury and declared; \"''How can anyone dare to speak of our slight sympathy when on many different and public occasions we have condemned Communism and conferred our benevolence on those who fight it?''\" From that moment Magaz had condemned himself in the eyes of both the Vatican and Franco.<ref>Raguer, p.95</ref> Pius XI appointed [[Isidro Goma y Tomas]] as his unofficial and confidential representative at Franco's headquarters, a role he performed from 19 December 1936 to 18 September 1937, while Monsignore [[Ildebrando Antoniutti|Antoniutti]], who had arrived in Spain in October 1936 on another mission, was named as the Papal Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires. Goma's influence on the attitude of Pius XI was powerful. Having met with [[Eugenio Pacelli]] and Pius XI on December 19, 1936, Goma wrote in his diary ; \" the unfriendly attitude towards Spain was abandoned after my report to Pacelli had been read and a formula was found to create close ties with the government of Franco.\"\n\nGoma was a man of the Church, unlike Magaz, and suspicious of some of those surrounding Franco\u2014an anti-clerical sector which could stain the perceived Christian spirit of the Franco movement. This anti-clerical sector, he confronted in his Pastoral Letter of 28 January 1938, to mark the fourteenth anniversary of the coronation of Pius XI. In the third part, entitled 'Pius XI and Spain' he spoke of the Pope's love for Spain and in the fourth part, ''Prevengamonos'' ('Let us prevent'), he challenged those who attacked Pius XI for not intervening more determinedly in favour of the Francoist Uprising. In the fifth he confronted anti-Vatican sentiment in the Movement ;\"We have heard and read, 'Catholics, yes; Vaticanists, no'; and it is with pain that we have seen it expressed in more sophisticated terms by a section of the press.\" Franco, since 1 October 1936 had taken over all the powers of the junta and sought to gain the full support of Pius XI. The policy of Pius XI, which Goma first and afterwards Antoniutti and [[Gaetano Cicognani|Cicognani]] maintained, towards Franco's government, was characterised by a strong anticommunism on the one hand, an on the other, a suspicion of [[falangism]], and of the influence of Franco's German Nazi and Italian Fascist allies; the Vatican policy sought to guide the regime into the repeal of the anti-clerical laws of the Republic and away from 'pagan' and imported totalitarian temptations. Goma was received by Franco on 29 December 1936 and six basic points were established at the meeting - points that were the seeds of the Concordat of 1953.\n\n==''The Divini Redemptoris'' encyclical, March 1937==\nPius XI's 'third way' policy of neither communism nor fascism was illustrated by the publication in early 1937 of one encyclical against Communism and another against Nazism. The ''Divini Redemptoris'' devoted a paragraph to ''the horrors of communism in Spain'', and dwelt on the assassination of priests and religious. In Franco's Spain this encyclical against Communism received wide circulation, but the publication of ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' was prohibited. Franco told von Faupel, German Ambassador, that while Pius XI was recognised as the highest religious authority in Spain, any interference in internal Spanish affairs had to be rejected. He told the German ambassador that he too, Franco, had to fight against the Vatican. He had instructed the [[Archbishop of Toledo]], Goma, that no mention should be made in Spain of the encyclical ''Mit brennender Sorge'' and that in this way any criticism of Germany would be cut off.<ref>Raguer, p.103</ref>\n\nIn 1937 there was dual representation with the Salamanca government, raised to the level of Charg\u00e9s d'Affaires, with Antoniutti at Salamanca and Churruca at Rome, and mention of the Valencia (Republican) government reduced to a line of dots in the ''Annuario Pontificio''. By 1938 relations with Franco reached the level of full Ambassador and [[Nuncio]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pope Pius Xi And Spain}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:Spanish Civil War]]\n[[Category:Catholic Church in Spain]]\n", "text_old": "\n\nForeign relations between [[Pope Pius XI]] and [[Spain]] were very tense, especially because they occurred within the context of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the period of troubles preceding it.\n\n==Anti-clerical government==\nThe Republican government which came to power in Spain in 1931, as the country embraced constitutional democracy, following the fall of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and the exit of the King, [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], seemed to signal that Spain was breaking with elements of its past.

This amendment stated that civil rights cannot be denied on the basis of one's sex. It was authored by [[Alice Paul]], head of the [[National Women's Party]], who led the [[suffrage]] campaign. Through the efforts of Alice Paul, the Amendment was introduced into each session of the [[United States Congress]]. But it was buried in committee in both Houses of Congress. In 1946, it was narrowly defeated by the full [[United States Senate|Senate]], 38\u201335. In February 1970 twenty NOW leaders disrupted the hearings of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, demanding the ERA be heard by the full Congress. In May of that year, the Senate Subcommittee began hearings on the ERA under Senator [[Birch Bayh]]. In June, the ERA finally left the House Judiciary Committee due to a discharge petition filed by Representative [[Martha Griffiths]]. In March 1972, the ERA was approved by the full Senate without changes, 84\u20138. Senator [[Sam Ervin]] and Representative [[Emanuel Celler]] succeeded in setting an arbitrary time limit of seven years for ratification. The ERA went to individual states to be ratified by the state legislatures. The ERA first attempted to be passed after the passing of the nineteenth amendment in 1920 by the feminists in the National Woman's Party, but it got little attention at the time.\n\nIn 2008, the ERA was stopped three states short of ratification. The state legislatures that were most hostile to the ERA were Utah, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina and Oklahoma. The NOW believes that the single most obvious problem in passing the ERA was the gender and racial imbalance in the legislatures. More than 2/3 of the women and all of the African Americans in state legislatures voted for the ERA, but less than 50% of the white men in the targeted legislatures cast pro-ERA votes in 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.now.org/issues/economic/cea/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807035643/http://www.now.org/issues/economic/cea/history.html |archivedate=2007-08-07 }}</ref>\n\n===The Constitutional Equity Amendment===\nThe Constitutional Equity Amendment (CEA) was rolled out in 1995 by American women's organizations.

This amendment stated that civil rights cannot be denied on the basis of one's sex. It was authored by [[Alice Paul]], head of the [[National Women's Party]], who led the [[suffrage]] campaign. Through the efforts of Alice Paul, the Amendment was introduced into each session of the [[United States Congress]]. But it was buried in committee in both Houses of Congress. In 1946, it was narrowly defeated by the full [[United States Senate|Senate]], 38\u201335. In February 1970 twenty NOW leaders disrupted the hearings of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, demanding the ERA be heard by the full Congress. In May of that year, the Senate Subcommittee began hearings on the ERA under Senator [[Birch Bayh]]. In June, the ERA finally left the House Judiciary Committee due to a discharge petition filed by Representative [[Martha Griffiths]]. In March 1972, the ERA was approved by the full Senate without changes, 84\u20138. Senator [[Sam Ervin]] and Representative [[Emanuel Celler]] succeeded in setting an arbitrary time limit of seven years for ratification. The ERA went to individual states to be ratified by the state legislatures. The ERA first attempted to be passed after the passing of the nineteenth amendment in 1920 by the feminists in the National Woman's Party, but it got little attention at the time.\n\nIn 2008, the ERA was stopped three states short of ratification. The state legislatures that were most hostile to the ERA were Utah, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina and Oklahoma. The NOW believes that the single most obvious problem in passing the ERA was the gender and racial imbalance in the legislatures. More than 2/3 of the women and all of the African Americans in state legislatures voted for the ERA, but less than 50% of the white men in the targeted legislatures cast pro-ERA votes in 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.now.org/issues/economic/cea/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807035643/http://www.now.org/issues/economic/cea/history.html |archivedate=2007-08-07 }}</ref>\n\n===The Constitutional Equity Amendment===\nThe Constitutional Equity Amendment (CEA) was rolled out in 1995 by American women's organizations.

The items that were included in the CEA which were missing in the ERA include:\n\n*States that women and men shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place and entity subject to its jurisdiction;\n*It guarantees rights without discrimination on account of sex, race, sexual orientation, marital status, ethnicity, national origin, color or indigence;\n*It prohibits pregnancy discrimination and guarantees the absolute right of a woman to make her own reproductive decisions including the termination of pregnancy;\n\n== Equity feminism ==\n{{main|Equity feminism}}\n[[Equity feminism]] is a form of liberal feminism discussed since the 1980s,<ref>{{cite book | last = Black | first = Naomi | title = Social feminism | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca |url= https://books.google.ca/books?id=kDYqAAAAYAAJ | year = 1989 | isbn = 9780801422614 }}</ref><ref name=Halfmann>{{cite book | last = Halfmann | first = Jost | chapter = Social change and political mobilization in West Germany | chapter-url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=Q83kxhOsgxYC&pg=PA79 | editor-last = Katzenstein | editor-first = Peter | title = Industry and politics in West Germany: toward the Third Republic |page=79 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, N.Y | year = 1989 | isbn = 9780801495953 |quote=Quote: ''Equity-feminism differs from equality-feminism in the depth and scope of its strategic goals.

Nguyen created the game over the period of several days, using a bird protagonist that he had designed for a cancelled game in 2012.\n\nThe game was released in May 2013 but received a sudden rise in popularity in early 2014. ''Flappy Bird'' received poor reviews from some critics, who criticized its high level of difficulty, alleged plagiarism in graphics and game mechanics, while other reviewers found it addictive. At the end of January 2014, it was the most downloaded free game in the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] for [[iOS]]. During this period, its developer said that ''Flappy Bird'' was earning $50,000 a day from in-app advertisements as well as sales.\n\n''Flappy Bird'' was removed from both the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and [[Google Play]] by its creator on February 10, 2014, due to guilt over what he considered to be its addictive nature and overuse. The game's popularity and sudden removal caused phones with it pre-installed to be put up for sale for high prices over the Internet.<ref name=\"techland\" /><ref name=\"Molina-EBay\" /><ref name=\"Thier-EBay\" /> [[Video game clone|Games similar]] to ''Flappy Bird'' became popular on the iTunes App Store in the wake of its removal, and both Apple and Google have removed games from their app stores for being too similar to the original.

After a nationwide search, management hired Ben Boyett and Phil Bremen to anchor a newscast with a new set and format, known as ''newsnine''.<ref name=\"studioz7.com\"/> The new format did not really draw many new viewers, and the station's low news budget, ill-conceived promotion and frequent technical glitches didn't help matters.

In December 1977, ABC warned KMSP that it would yank its affiliation unless improvements were made and fast. In early 1978, to cash in on ABC's improved ratings, KMSP re-branded itself \"ABC9\" (approximately 20 years before the use of a network's name in a station's on-air branding became commonplace among U.S. affiliates), and retooled its newscast.

The station began carrying Fox's entire programming schedule at that time, including the ''[[Fox Box]]'' children's block (which later returned to WFTC as [[4KidsTV]], until the block was discontinued by Fox in December 2008 due to a dispute with [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]]). The affiliation swap coincided with the start of the [[2002 NFL season|2002]] NFL season; KMSP effectively became the \"home\" station for the NFL's [[Minnesota Vikings]] as a result of Fox [[NFL on Fox|holding the broadcast rights]] to the [[National Football Conference]] (from [[1994 Minnesota Vikings season|1994]] to [[2001 Minnesota Vikings season|2001]], most Vikings games were aired on WFTC). Finally, in 2014, with the launch of ''[[Xploration Station]]'' which replaced ''[[Weekend Marketplace]]'' which WFTC carried, KMSP-TV began clearing the entire Fox network schedule for good.\n\nSince Fox has affiliates in most [[media market]]s and the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s [[syndication exclusivity]] regulations normally require [[cable television|cable systems]] to only carry a given network's local affiliate, and Fox prefers only an area's affiliate be carried as opposed to a distant station for ratings tabulation purposes, KMSP was eventually removed from most cable providers outside the Twin Cities. By this time, these areas had enough stations to provide local Fox affiliates. KMSP thus effectively lost the \"regional superstation\" status it had held for almost a quarter-century, dating back to when it was an independent station. Due to the advent of [[digital terrestrial television|digital television]], many stations in smaller markets previously served by KMSP began operating UPN-affiliated [[digital subchannel]]s towards the end of the network's run to replace that network's programming in those markets, which in turn became MyNetworkTV or [[The CW|CW]] affiliates.\n\nOn December 14, 2017, [[The Walt Disney Company]], owner of KSTP-TV's affiliated network ABC, announced its intent to buy KMSP-TV's parent company, [[21st Century Fox]], for $66.1 billion; the sale, which closed on March 20, 2019, excluded KMSP-TV and sister station WFTC as well as the Fox network, the MyNetworkTV programming service, [[Fox News]], [[Fox Sports 1]], the [[Big Ten Network]] and the Fox Television Stations unit, which were all transferred to the newly-formed [[Fox Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Disney Buys Big Chunk Of Fox In $66.1B Deal|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/109662/disney-buys-big-chunk-of-fox-in-661b-deal|website=TVNewsCheck|date=December 14, 2017|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Murdoch: New Fox Interested In More Stations|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/mobile/index/article/id/109669|website=TVNewsCheck|date=December 14, 2017|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\nThe digital signals of KMSP and WFTC each contain three [[Digital subchannel|subchannels]].

This ensures reception of both stations, even in cases where the [[ATSC|digital]] channels that KMSP and WFTC operate are not actually receivable.\n\nOn June 19, 2014, KMSP-TV announced plans that, effective June 24, 2014, they would broadcast their 9.1 virtual channel via RF channel 29 (with RF channel 9 mapping to [[PSIP]] 9.9) to take advantage of its broader coverage area and allow viewers with UHF-only antennas to receive the station in high definition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/story/25820097/rescan-how-to-get-fox-9-over-the-air-on-uhf |title=RESCAN: How to get FOX 9 over-the-air on UHF |date= |accessdate=June 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703002323/http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/story/25820097/rescan-how-to-get-fox-9-over-the-air-on-uhf |archive-date=July 3, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Minneapolis\u2014St. Paul market is unique in that all three television duopolies in the market, which besides KMSP/WFTC, include [[Twin Cities Public Television]]'s KTCA/KTCI and [[Hubbard Broadcasting]]'s [[KSTP-TV|KSTP]] and [[KSTC-TV|KSTC]], have merged their various signals onto the same VHF PSIP channel slots for easier viewer reference (with all but KMSP-TV transmitting on UHF). KMSP and WFTC unified all of their over-the-air channels as virtual subchannels of KMSP. As a result, the PSIPs of WFTC changed to channel 9.\n\n===Analog-to-digital conversion===\nKMSP-TV originally broadcast its digital signal on UHF channel 26, which was remapped as [[virtual channel]] 9 on digital television receivers through the use of [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]]. The station shut down its analog signal, over [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 9, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]] under federal mandate.

After a nationwide search, management hired Ben Boyett and Phil Bremen to anchor a newscast with a new set and format, known as ''newsnine''.<ref name=\"studioz7.com\"/> The new format did not really draw many new viewers, and the station's low news budget, ill-conceived promotion and frequent technical glitches didn't help matters. One botched campaign for a news series on [[venereal disease]], in the spring of 1974, resulted in lawsuits from two young women that claimed that their likenesses were used in promos without their permission, thus damaging their reputations.<ref name=\"studioz7.com\"/> By the fall of 1975, Boyett and Bremen would be gone, replaced by respected veteran newsman [[Don Harrison]] and the station's first female anchor, Cathie Mann. These changes did little to take channel 9 out of third place, and despite ABC becoming the #1 network by 1977, KMSP's newscasts still struggled.<ref name=\"studioz7.com\"/>\n\nAfter KMSP lost the ABC affiliation in 1979, the station's news operation was relaunched with a prime time newscast, which was paired with the syndicated ''[[Independent Network News (US)|Independent Network News]]'' in the early 1980s. The newscast's budget and ratings would increase by the end of the 1980s; after KMSP rejoined Fox in 2002, the station's prime time newscast, aided by Fox's prime time lineup, frequently outrated the newscasts on KSTP-TV.<ref name=\"studioz7.com\"/> Following Fox's acquisition of WFTC in 2001, that station's existing news operation was moved to the KMSP studios;<ref name=\"mspbj-kmspfoxagain\"/> after Fox canceled channel 29's newscast in 2006, some of WFTC's news staff joined KMSP.<ref name=\"st-wftcnewsend\">{{cite news|last1=Rybak|first1=Deborah Caulfield|title=WFTC drops newscast at 10; KMSP adds it|url=http://www.startribune.com/459/story/468475.htm|accessdate=July 22, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=June 1, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615055800/http://www.startribune.com/459/story/468475.html|archivedate=June 15, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn May 11, 2009, KMSP became the second station in the Twin Cities (behind KARE-TV) to broadcast local newscasts in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].\n\n===Controversy===\nOn June 16, 2006, during one of the station's newscasts, KMSP broadcast a \"[[video news release]]\" about [[Convertible (car)|convertibles]] produced by [[General Motors]].

Strabo also interprets Achelous's contest with Heracles as being a myth based upon the underlying \"truth\" that Heracles, to please his father-in-law Oeneus, confined the river by means of \"embankments and channels\", thus gaining new large tracts of a cultivatable land, which represented Amaltheia's horn of plenty.<ref>Smith, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DA%3Aentry+group%3D3%3Aentry%3Dachelous-bio-1 s.v.
