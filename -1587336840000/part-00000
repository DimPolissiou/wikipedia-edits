Raised in [[Stockton, California]], by working-class parents, Leigh was discovered at 18 by actress [[Norma Shearer]], who helped her secure a contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Leigh had her first formal foray into acting appearing in radio programs before making her film debut in ''[[The Romance of Rosy Ridge]]'' (1947).\n\nEarly in her career, she appeared in several popular films for MGM which spanned a wide variety of genres, including ''[[Act of Violence]]'' (1948), ''[[Little Women (1949 film)|Little Women]]'' (1949), ''[[Angels in the Outfield (1951 film)|Angels in the Outfield]]'' (1951), ''[[Scaramouche (1952 film)|Scaramouche]]'' (1952), ''[[The Naked Spur]]'' (1953), and ''[[Living It Up]]'' (1954). Leigh played mostly dramatic roles during the latter half of the 1950s, in such films as ''[[Safari (1956 film)|Safari]]'' (1956) and [[Orson Welles]]'s film noir ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958), but achieved her most lasting recognition as the doomed [[Marion Crane]] in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), which earned her a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress]] and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\nHer highly publicized marriage to actor [[Tony Curtis]] ended in divorce in 1962, and after starring in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' that same year, Leigh scaled back her career. Intermittently, she continued to appear in films, including ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' (1963), ''[[Harper (film)|Harper]]'' (1966), ''[[Night of the Lepus]]'' (1972), and ''[[Boardwalk (film)|Boardwalk]]'' (1979). In late 1975, she made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in a production of ''Murder Among Friends''. She would also go on to appear in two horror films with her daughter, [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]: ''[[The Fog]]'' (1980) and ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998).\n\nIn addition to her work as an actress, Leigh also wrote four books between 1984 and 2002, two of which were novels. She died in October 2004 at age 77, following a year-long battle with [[vasculitis]], an inflammation of the blood vessels.\n\n== Early life ==\nThe only child of Helen Lita (n\u00e9e Westergaard) and Frederick Robert Morrison, Leigh was born '''Jeanette Helen Morrison''' on July 6, 1927, in [[Merced, California]].{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=4}} Her maternal grandparents were immigrants from [[Denmark]],{{sfn|Leigh|1984|p=6}} and her father had [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] and [[German American|German]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/CA/german.html|title=German ancestry Politicians in California|website=[[The Political Graveyard]]|accessdate=May 14, 2015}}</ref> Shortly after Leigh's birth, the family relocated to [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], where she spent her early life.{{sfn|Capua|2013|pages=4\u20136, 8}} She was brought up in poverty, as her father struggled to support the family with his factory employment, and he took various additional jobs after the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Capua|2013|pages=5\u20137}}\n\nLeigh was raised [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] and sang in the local church choir throughout her childhood.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=8}} In 1941, when her paternal grandfather became terminally ill, the family relocated to Merced where they moved into her grandparents' home.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=9}} She attended Weber Grammar School in Stockton,{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=7}} and later [[Stockton High School (California)|Stockton High School]].{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=10}} Leigh excelled in academics and graduated from high school at age sixteen.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=10}}\n\nIn September 1943, she enrolled at the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|College of the Pacific]] (now [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]]), where she majored in music and [[psychology]].{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=146}} While in college, she joined the Alpha Theta Tau sorority,{{sfn|Capua|2013|pages=9\u201310}} and also sang with the college's [[a cappella]] choir.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=9}} In order to help support her family, she spent Christmas and summer vacations working at retail shops and [[variety store|dime store]]s, as well as working at the college's information desk during her studies.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=9}}\n\n==Career==\n===Discovery and radio appearances===\n[[File:Janet Leigh c. 1945.png|thumb|220px|upright|Leigh pictured at age eighteen; actress [[Norma Shearer]] helped facilitate her contract with MGM based on this photo]]\nIn the winter of 1945\u20136, actress [[Norma Shearer]] was vacationing at [[Sugar Bowl Ski Resort|Sugar Bowl]], a ski resort in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains where Leigh's parents were working at the time.<ref name=laobit/>{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=12}} In the resort lobby, Shearer noticed a photograph of Leigh taken by the ski club photographer over the Christmas holiday, which he had printed and placed in a photo album available for guests to browse.{{sfn|Capua|2013|p=10}}\n\nUpon returning to Los Angeles, Shearer showed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) talent agent [[Lew Wasserman]] the photograph of the then-eighteen-year-old Leigh (Shearer's late husband [[Irving Thalberg]] had been a senior executive at MGM).

Raised in [[Stockton, California]], by working-class parents, Leigh was discovered at 18 by actress [[Norma Shearer]], who helped her secure a contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Leigh had her first formal foray into acting appearing in radio programs before making her film debut in ''[[The Romance of Rosy Ridge]]'' (1947).\n\nEarly in her career, she appeared in several popular films for MGM which spanned a wide variety of genres, including ''[[Act of Violence]]'' (1948), ''[[Little Women (1949 film)|Little Women]]'' (1949), ''[[Angels in the Outfield (1951 film)|Angels in the Outfield]]'' (1951), ''[[Scaramouche (1952 film)|Scaramouche]]'' (1952), ''[[The Naked Spur]]'' (1953), and ''[[Living It Up]]'' (1954). Leigh played mostly dramatic roles during the latter half of the 1950s, in such films as ''[[Safari (1956 film)|Safari]]'' (1956) and [[Orson Welles]]'s film noir ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958), but achieved her most lasting recognition as the doomed [[Marion Crane]] in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), which earned her a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress]] and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\nHer highly publicized marriage to actor [[Tony Curtis]] ended in divorce in 1962, and after starring in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' that same year, Leigh scaled back her career. Intermittently, she continued to appear in films, including ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' (1963), ''[[Harper (film)|Harper]]'' (1966), ''[[Night of the Lepus]]'' (1972), and ''[[Boardwalk (film)|Boardwalk]]'' (1979). In late 1975, she made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in a production of ''Murder Among Friends''. She would also go on to appear in two horror films with her daughter, [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]: ''[[The Fog]]'' (1980) and ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998).\n\nIn addition to her work as an actress, Leigh also wrote four books between 1984 and 2002, two of which were novels.

Completed in 1889, the building is located at the northwest corner of South [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] and Congress Street (now Ida B. Wells Drive). The building, which when constructed was the largest in the United States and the tallest in Chicago, was designed to be a multi-use complex, including offices, a theater, and a hotel. As a young apprentice, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] worked on some of the interior design.\n\nThe [[Auditorium Theatre]] is part of the Auditorium Building and is located at 50 East Ida B. Wells Drive.  The theater was the first home of the [[Chicago Civic Opera]] and the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]].  It currently hosts the season performances of the [[Joffrey Ballet]].\n\nThe building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on April 17, 1970.<ref name=\"nrhpnom\"/> It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1975,<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/> and was designated a [[Chicago Landmark]] on September 15, 1976.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/landmarksweb/web/landmarkdetails.htm?lanId=1246&counter=20 |title=Auditorium Building|work=Commission on Chicago Landmarks|publisher=Chicago Department of Housing and Economic Development, Historic Preservation Division|accessdate=December 8, 2011}}</ref> In addition, it is a historic district contributing property for the Chicago Landmark [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]]. Since 1947, the Auditorium Building has been part of [[Roosevelt University]].\n\n==Origin and purpose==\n[[Ferdinand Peck]], a Chicago businessman, incorporated the Chicago Auditorium Association in December 1886 to develop what he wanted to be the world's largest, grandest, most expensive [[theater (structure)|theater]] that would rival such institutions as the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]] in [[New York City]]. He was said to have wanted to make high culture accessible to the working classes of Chicago.\n\nThe building was to include an office block and a first class hotel. Peck persuaded many Chicago business tycoons to go on board with him, including [[Marshall Field]], Edson Keith, [[Martin A. Ryerson]], [[Charles L. Hutchinson]] and [[George Pullman]]. The association hired the [[Adler & Sullivan|renowned architectural firm]] of [[Dankmar Adler]] and [[Louis Sullivan]] to design the building. At the time, a young [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was employed at the firm as draftsman, and he may have contributed to the design.<ref>\"Some interior details were probably drawn by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who started in Sullivan's office as a draftsman in 1887.\"\nBanister Fletcher. ''A History of Architecture''. p. 1241.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Auditorium was built for a [[syndicate]] of [[businessmen]] to house a large civic opera house; to provide an economic base it was decided to wrap the auditorium with a hotel and office block. Hence Adler & Sullivan had to plan a complex multiple-use building. Fronting on [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], overlooking the [[lake]], was the hotel (now Roosevelt University) while the offices were placed to the west on Wabash Avenue. The entrance to the auditorium is on the south side beneath the tall blocky eighteen-story tower. The rest of the building is a uniform ten stories, organized in the same way as Richardson's [[Marshall Field]] [[Wholesale]] Store. The interior embellishment, however, is wholly Sullivan's, and some of the details, because of their continuous [[curvilinear]] foliate [[Motif (art)|motifs]], are among the nearest equivalents to [[Europe]]an [[Art Nouveau]] [[architecture]].<ref>Roth, Leland M. ''A Concise History of American Architecture''. p. 179-80</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Design==\nSullivan and Adler designed a tall structure with load-bearing outer walls, and based the exterior appearance partly on the design of [[Henry Hobson Richardson|H.H. Richardson]]'s [[Marshall Field Warehouse]], another Chicago landmark.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Idea of Louis Sullivan | last=Sarkowski | first=John | year=1956 | publisher=Bulfinch Press | page=22 | isbn=0-8212-2667-3}}</ref>  The Auditorium is a heavy, impressive structure externally, and was more striking in its day when buildings of its scale were less common.  When completed, it was the tallest building in the city and largest building in the [[United States]].<ref name=FFFE>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122064771323104933 |title=Form Follows Function, Elegantly: Louis Sullivan designed the Auditorium Theatre's interior to complement its acoustics-driven shape |accessdate=2008-09-07 |date=September 6, 2008 |publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]] |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |author=Henning, Joel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911214215/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122064771323104933.html |archivedate=September 11, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOne of the most innovative features of the building was its massive raft [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]], designed by Adler in conjunction with engineer Paul Mueller. The soil beneath the Auditorium consists of soft blue [[clay]] to a depth of over 100 feet, which made conventional foundations impossible.  Adler and Mueller designed a floating mat of crisscrossed [[railroad tie]]s, topped with a double layer of [[steel]] rails embedded in [[concrete]], the whole assemblage coated with [[pitch (resin)|pitch]].\n\nThe resulting raft distributed the weight of the massive outer walls over a large area. However, the weight of the masonry outer walls in relation to the relatively lightweight interior deformed the raft during the course of a century, and today portions of the building have settled as much as 29&nbsp;inches. This deflection is clearly visible in the theater lobby, where the [[mosaic]] floor takes on a distinct slope as it nears the outer walls.  This settlement is not because of poor engineering but the fact the design was changed during construction.  The original plan had the exterior covered in lightweight terra-cotta, but this was changed to stone after the foundations were under construction.  Most of the settlement occurred within a decade after construction, and at one time a plan existed to shorten the interior supports to level the floors but this was never carried out.\n\nIn the center of the building was a 4,300 seat [[auditorium]], originally intended primarily for production of [[Grand Opera]].  In keeping with Peck's democratic ideals, the auditorium was designed so that all seats would have good views and acoustics.  The original plans had no [[Box (theatre)|box seats]] and when these were added to the plans they did not receive prime locations.\n\nHoused in the building around the central space were an 1890 addition of 136 [[office]]s and a 400-room [[hotel]],<ref name=FFFE/><ref name=ABEOC>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/89.html|title=Auditorium Building|accessdate=2008-09-07|year=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]|author=Carey, Heidi Pawlowski}}</ref> whose purpose was to generate much of the revenue to support the opera.  While the Auditorium Building was not intended as a commercial building, Peck wanted it to be self-sufficient.  Revenue from the offices and hotel was meant to allow ticket prices to remain reasonable. In reality, both the hotel and office block became unprofitable within a few years.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Auditorium bldg (Interior) HABS.jpg |interior cross-section\nFile:Auditorium bldg (foundations) HABS.jpg |foundation\nFile:Auditorium bldg (basement) HABS.jpg |basement\n</gallery>\n\n==Later uses==\nOn October 5, 1887, President [[Grover Cleveland]] laid the [[cornerstone]] for the Auditorium Building. The [[1888 Republican National Convention]] was held in a partially finished building where [[Benjamin Harrison]] was nominated as a presidential candidate. On December 9, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison dedicated the building and opera star [[Adelina Patti]] sang \"Home Sweet Home\" to thunderous applause.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Adler & Sullivan had also opened their offices on the 16th and 17th floors of the Auditorium tower.\n[[File:Roosevelt university murray green library 2017-09-10.jpg|thumb|[[Roosevelt University]]'s Murray-Green Library on the 10th floor of the Auditorium Building]]\n\nThe [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] debuted on October 16, 1891, and made its home in the Auditorium Theatre until moving to [[Symphony Center|Orchestra Hall]] in 1904.<ref name=FFFE/>\n\nThe opera company renting the accommodation moved to the [[Civic Opera House]] in 1929, and the Auditorium Theatre closed during the [[Great Depression]].

By 1946, [[Roosevelt University]] moved into the Auditorium Building,<ref name=FFFE/> but the theater was not restored to its former splendor.\n\nIn 1952, Congress Parkway was widened, bringing the curb to the southern edge of the building.  To make room for a sidewalk, some ground-floor rooms and part of the theater lobby were removed and a sidewalk arcade created.<ref>{{Emporis|117207|Auditorium Building}}</ref>\n\n[[File:OBAMANOMENON (3004814871).jpg|thumb|right|Crowd outside the Auditorium Theatre during Obama's [[Barack Obama election victory speech, 2008|Grant Park rally on the night of the 2008 election]]]] \nOn October 31, 1967, the Auditorium Theatre reopened and through 1975, the Auditorium served as a [[rock concert|rock venue]].

However, the weight of the masonry outer walls in relation to the relatively lightweight interior deformed the raft during the course of a century, and today portions of the building have settled as much as 29&nbsp;inches. This deflection is clearly visible in the theater lobby, where the [[mosaic]] floor takes on a distinct slope as it nears the outer walls.  This settlement is not because of poor engineering but the fact the design was changed during construction.  The original plan had the exterior covered in lightweight terra-cotta, but this was changed to stone after the foundations were under construction.  Most of the settlement occurred within a decade after construction, and at one time a plan existed to shorten the interior supports to level the floors but this was never carried out.\n\nIn the center of the building was a 4,300 seat [[auditorium]], originally intended primarily for production of [[Grand Opera]].  In keeping with Peck's democratic ideals, the auditorium was designed so that all seats would have good views and acoustics.  The original plans had no [[Box (theatre)|box seats]] and when these were added to the plans they did not receive prime locations.\n\nHoused in the building around the central space were an 1890 addition of 136 [[office]]s and a 400-room [[hotel]],<ref name=FFFE/><ref name=ABEOC>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/89.html|title=Auditorium Building|accessdate=2008-09-07|year=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]|author=Carey, Heidi Pawlowski}}</ref> whose purpose was to generate much of the revenue to support the opera.  While the Auditorium Building was not intended as a commercial building, Peck wanted it to be self-sufficient.  Revenue from the offices and hotel was meant to allow ticket prices to remain reasonable. In reality, both the hotel and office block became unprofitable within a few years.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Auditorium bldg (Interior) HABS.jpg |interior cross-section\nFile:Auditorium bldg (foundations) HABS.jpg |foundation\nFile:Auditorium bldg (basement) HABS.jpg |basement\n</gallery>\n\n==Later uses==\nOn October 5, 1887, President [[Grover Cleveland]] laid the [[cornerstone]] for the Auditorium Building.

The penalties were handed down after a 2 year investigation into alleged academic fraud, conducted by the University of Missouri and initiated by former Missouri tutor Yolanda Kumar's allegations in November 2016 that she improperly assisted 42 student-athletes. She claimed she was groomed by her superiors to commit \"academic dishonesty\" and alleged that she completed online courses and took final exams for Missouri men's basketball and football players. The NCAA Division I Committee on Infractions found that Kumar violated NCAA ethical conduct, academic misconduct and academic extra benefits rules when she completed academic work for 12 student-athletes. The NCAA's report did not find evidence that her colleagues directed her to complete the athletes' work. Kumar was given a 10-year show-cause order, in which any NCAA member attempting to hire her must restrict her from any athletic-related duties. The football, baseball and softball programs will have a 5 percent reduction in scholarships and a 12.5 percent reduction in official visits and evaluation days for the 2019\u201320 academic year. Further, these sports will face a 7 week ban on unofficial visits, recruiting communications, and off-campus recruiting evaluation days. Finally, the NCAA fined Missouri $5,000, plus 1 percent of each of its budgets in football, baseball and softball.

The regular season began on August 24, 2019, and ended on December 14, 2019. The postseason concluded on January 13, 2020, with the [[2020 College Football Playoff National Championship]] at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] in [[New Orleans]]. This was the sixth season of the [[College Football Playoff]] (CFP) championship system.\n\nNovember 6, 2019, marked the 150th anniversary of what is traditionally considered the [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|first college football game]], played between [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton]] and [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]] in [[1869 college football season|1869]]. Various sports media, the NCAA, and the CFP honored the 150th anniversary of the sport throughout the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cfb150.org/news/2019/1/29/general-cfb150-partners-with-cfp-to-celebrate-150-years-of-college-football.aspx|title=CFB150 Partners With CFP To Celebrate 150 Years Of College Football|website=CFB150.org|date=January 7, 2019|access-date=May 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/25659433/espn-college-football-150-celebrates-larger-life-sport|title=Welcome to CFB 150: Here's what makes college football great|first=Ivan|last=Maisel|website=ESPN.com|date=January 2, 2019|access-date=May 13, 2019}}</ref> Because there were no games played during the [[1871 college football season|1871 season]], this was also the 150th season of college football.\n\nThe national championship game featured the No. 1 ranked [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU Tigers]] and No. 3 ranked [[2019 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson Tigers]], with LSU winning by a score of 42\u201325.\n\n==Conference realignment==\n\n===Membership changes===\n[[Liberty Flames football|Liberty]] completed a two-year transition from the [[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]] to the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] in 2018 and is fully [[Bowl eligibility|bowl-eligible]] beginning with the 2019 season. It will remain an [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|NCAA Division I FBS Independent]].\n\n==Rule changes==\nThe following playing rule changes have been approved by the NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel for 2019:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/targeting-protocols-approved-football|title=Targeting protocols approved for football|website=ncaa.org|date=April 23, 2019|}}</ref>\n\n* Requiring replay reviews on targeting calls be either confirmed or overturned by reviewing all aspects of the play.  If the review cannot confirm that all elements of targeting exist, the targeting call will be overturned.\n* Players who commit three or more targeting penalties in the same season will receive a one-game suspension in addition to any ejection penalties.\n* Eliminating the two-man wedge on kickoffs, except when the kicking team is in an obvious onside kick formation or if the kick results in a touchback, fair catch, or goes out of bounds in the field of play.\n* Starting with the fifth overtime period, each team will line up at the three-yard line to attempt a two point conversion instead of snapping the ball from the 25 yard line.  The first game using this new procedure was on October 19, 2019, between the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|North Carolina Tar Heels]] and the [[Virginia Tech Hokies Football|Virginia Tech Hokies]] which went to six overtimes before Virginia Tech won 43\u201341.\n*Adding a two-minute break after the second and fourth overtime period.\n*Blindside blocks delivered with forcible contact will draw a 15-yard penalty (personal foul).  If elements of targeting exist, the player delivering the block will be subject to ejection (and suspension if it's the third targeting foul in the season) as with any other targeting foul.\n\n==Other headlines==\n*January 31 \u2013 The NCAA Division I Committee on Infractions banned SEC school [[Missouri Tigers|Missouri's]] football, baseball and softball teams from competing in the postseason for the 2019 season and placed the athletics department on 3 years of probation. The penalties were handed down after a 2 year investigation into alleged academic fraud, conducted by the University of Missouri and initiated by former Missouri tutor Yolanda Kumar's allegations in November 2016 that she improperly assisted 42 student-athletes. She claimed she was groomed by her superiors to commit \"academic dishonesty\" and alleged that she completed online courses and took final exams for Missouri men's basketball and football players. The NCAA Division I Committee on Infractions found that Kumar violated NCAA ethical conduct, academic misconduct and academic extra benefits rules when she completed academic work for 12 student-athletes. The NCAA's report did not find evidence that her colleagues directed her to complete the athletes' work. Kumar was given a 10-year show-cause order, in which any NCAA member attempting to hire her must restrict her from any athletic-related duties. The football, baseball and softball programs will have a 5 percent reduction in scholarships and a 12.5 percent reduction in official visits and evaluation days for the 2019\u201320 academic year. Further, these sports will face a 7 week ban on unofficial visits, recruiting communications, and off-campus recruiting evaluation days. Finally, the NCAA fined Missouri $5,000, plus 1 percent of each of its budgets in football, baseball and softball.

However, Kansas State built a large 48\u201323 lead by scoring on 8 consecutive possessions, including scoring on each possession in the 2nd and 3rd quarters, after punting on its first possession of the game. In the 4th quarter, Oklahoma scored 18 consecutive points to cut the Kansas State lead to 48\u201341. After Oklahoma attempted an onside kick and appeared to recover it, the recovery was overturned due to an Oklahoma player touching the football prior to the ball traveling the required 10 yards. Kansas State was awarded possession of the ball and ran out the clock to preserve the Wildcats' first win over a top 5 team since 2006 and their first home win over Oklahoma since 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2859875-jalen-hurts-unable-to-save-oklahoma-from-upset-vs-skylar-thompson-kansas-state.amp.html|title=Jalen Hurts unable to save Oklahoma from upset vs. Skylar Thompson, Kansas State|last=Daniels|first=Tim|date=26 October 2019|accessdate=27 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/oklahoma-vs-kansas-state-score-takeaways-no-5-sooners-suffer-massive-upset-as-24-point-favorites/|title=Oklahoma vs. Kansas score, takeaways: No. 5 Sooners suffer massive upset as 24 point favorites|last=Kercheval|first=Ben|date=26 October 2019|accessdate=27 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''No. 6 Oregon (\u221213.5) loses at Arizona State'''\n\nOn November 23, No. 6 [[2019 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon Ducks]] (9\u20131, 7\u20130) traveled to the [[2019 Arizona State Sun Devils football team|Arizona State Sun Devils]] (5\u20135, 2\u20135) for a conference game.

Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=December 10, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63plxMYlJ?url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" \n|-\n!

Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=December 10, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63plxMYlJ?url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" \n|-\n!
