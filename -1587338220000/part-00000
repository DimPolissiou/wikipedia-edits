From the 17th to the late 18th century a series of parliaments were held between royal governors and Mapuche [[lonko]]s and the war devolved to sporadic pillaging carried out by Spanish soldiers as well as Mapuches and [[Banditry in Chile|outlaws]].\n\nThe [[Chilean War of Independence]] brought new hostilities to the frontier, with different factions of Spaniards, Chileans and Mapuches fighting for independence, royalism or personal gain. Mapuche independence finally ended with the Chilean [[occupation of Araucan\u00eda]] between 1861 and 1883. The modern [[Mapuche conflict]] is partially inspired by the Arauco War.\n\n==Causes==\nInitially, the key area of conflict that the Spanish attempted to secure south of [[B\u00edo B\u00edo River]] were the valleys around [[Cordillera de Nahuelbuta]].

The beginning of the war comes with the campaigns of conquest of [[Pedro de Valdivia]].\n\n===Campaigns of Pedro de Valdivia (1546\u20131553)===\n[[Image:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pedro de Valdivia]]]]\n[[File:Ines de Suarez 2.JPG|thumb|upright|Do\u00f1a [[In\u00e9s de Su\u00e1rez]] in defending the city of Santiago]]\nDuring the early phase of the [[Conquest of Chile]], the Spanish [[conquistador]] Pedro de Valdivia conducted a nine-year campaign to secure the city of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], which had been [[Destruction of Santiago|destroyed on September 11, 1541]] by the [[Mapochoes]] under the direction of their chief, [[Michimalonco]]. Valdivia hoped to enlarge the territory under his jurisdiction and, despite injuries from a fall from his horse, resolved to take personal command of a land expedition into [[Araucan\u00eda (historic region)|Araucan\u00eda]].\n\nIn 1544, a naval expedition was sent, comprising the [[Barque|bark]]s, ''San Pedro'' and ''Santiaguillo'', under the command of [[Juan Bautista Pastene]], to reconnoiter the southwestern coast of South America to the [[Strait of Magellan]]. The expedition set sail from [[Valpara\u00edso]], entered the [[Bay of Concepci\u00f3n|bay of San Pedro]], and made landings at what is now known as [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]] and at [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]], which was later named in honor of the commander. Encountering severe storms further south, he then returned to Valparaiso.\n\nValdivia himself set out in 1546, with sixty horsemen plus guides and porters, and crossed the [[Itata River]] and were attacked by [[Mapuche]] warriors in the [[Battle of Quilacura]] near the [[B\u00edo-B\u00edo River]]. Realizing that it would be impossible to proceed in such hostile territory with so limited a force, Valdivia elected to return to Santiago after finding a site for a new city at what is now [[Penco]] and that would become the first site of [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]].\n\n===Founding of Concepci\u00f3n, Imperial, and Valdivia===\nIn 1550, a new expedition was launched, consisting of a naval force under Pastene, and a land force of two hundred Spaniards mounted and foot and a number of [[Mapochoes|Mapocho]] auxiliaries under Valdivia. They planned to reunite on the shores of the Bay of Concepci\u00f3n. The expedition advanced beyond the [[Itata River]] and [[Laja River (Chile)|Laja River]], to the shores of the [[B\u00edo-B\u00edo River]]. Along the way they had several battles with groups of [[Mapuche]]s as they explored the region killing many with little loss to themselves. After spending over a week in the area and encountering increasing opposition, the Spanish marched toward the Sea through the valleys of the Laja and B\u00edo-B\u00edo rivers, towards the coast at Penco. On the banks of the [[Andali\u00e9n River]], they camped for two days between the river and a lake, where they were attacked on the second night by a large force of [[Mapuche|Araucanians]] under their [[toqui]] [[Ainavillo]] in the [[Battle of Andalien]]. The night attack was defeated in a furious battle, the Spaniards suffered one killed and many wounds to men and especially their mounts.

After reinforcement at Concepci\u00f3n in 1551, he organized another expedition to establish the fort [[Carahue|La Imperial]] on the banks of the [[Imperial River (Chile)|Imperial River]]. He then returned to Concepci\u00f3n to prepare another expedition and await the reinforcements the Viceroy had promised to send by sea.\n\nLeaving orders that the new troops should disembark on the ''Tierras de Valdivia'' that Pastene had discovered earlier, Valdivia left with two hundred soldiers in the direction of Fort Imperial. Once he had passed it on his way south, he ordered [[Jer\u00f3nimo de Alderete]] to drive inland and establish a fort, with the goal of securing his eastern flank. To this end, Alderente reached [[Lake Villarrica]] and established [[Villarrica, Chile|a fort]] there. Meanwhile, Valdivia's column advanced southwards and joined the reinforcements sent from [[Peru]], under the command of [[Francisco de Villagra]]. There, the city of [[Valdivia, Chile|Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca de Valdivia]] was established. After garrisoning these new places, Valdivia returned to his base at Concepci\u00f3n in 1552 where rich [[placer gold]] mines were found in the [[Quilacoya River]] valley.\n\n==First Great Mapuche Rebellion (1553)==\n[[File:Grabado Caupolican-Nicanor Plaza.jpg|thumbnail|Caupolican by [[Nicanor Plaza]]]]\n\n=== Lautaro and the Battle of Tucapel ===\nWith the goal of securing the lines of communication with the southern forts, Valdivia launched a third expedition which established forts at [[Tucapel]], [[Pur\u00e9n]], [[Angol|Confines]] and [[Arauco, Chile|Arauco]]. The Araucanians didn't offer any resistance to the conquistadors in their fort-building. In October 1553, the Quilacoya gold mine was opened and large numbers of Mapuche were forced to work in it.\n\nIn 1553, the Mapuches held a council at which, because of the growth of Spanish forces in their territory, they resolved to make war. They chose as their \"[[toqui]]\" (wartime chief) an extraordinarily strong man called [[Caupolic\u00e1n]] and as his vice toqui [[Lautaro (toqui)|Lautaro]], because he had served as an auxiliary to the Spanish cavalry, his experiences with the Spanish gave him insight into the best methods for fighting the conquistadors.\n\nWith six thousand warriors under his command, Lautaro attacked the fort at [[Tucapel]]. The Spanish garrison was unable to withstand the assault and retreated to [[Pur\u00e9n]] and Lautaro seized and burned the fort and prepared his army certain that the Spaniards would attempt to retake Tucapel. Valdivia, with a reduced force, mounted a counter-attack, but he was quickly surrounded and his army was massacred by the Mapuches in the [[Battle of Tucapel]]. This was Pedro de Valdivia's last battle; he was captured and later killed in captivity when he refused to concede defeat.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cr\u00f3nica y relaci\u00f3n copiosa y verdadera de los reinos de Chile |last=Vivar |first=Jer\u00f3nimo de |authorlink=Jer\u00f3nimo de Vivar |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=CXVI |quote=...ayer mataron al apo y todos los cristianos que con \u00e9l ven\u00edan, que no escap\u00f3 ninguno, y todos los yanaconas de servicio, si no eran los que se hab\u00edan escondido |url=http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/cronicas/contextos/10876.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Campaigns of Caupolic\u00e1n and Lautaro (1554\u20131557)===\n[[Image:Espanoles guerreando en chile ovalle.jpg|thumb|Picture from [[Alonso de Ovalle]]'s ''Historia de Chile'']]\nAfter the defeat at Tucapel, the [[Spain|Spanish]] hurriedly reorganized their forces, reinforcing fort Imperial for its defence and abandoning Confines and Arauco in order to strengthen Concepci\u00f3n. However, Araucanian tradition dictated a lengthy victory celebration, which kept Lautaro from exploiting the weakness of the Spanish position as he desired. It was only in February 1554 that he succeeded in putting together an army of 8,000 men, just in time to confront a [[punitive expedition]] under the command of [[Francisco de Villagra]] at the [[Battle of Marihue\u00f1u]].\n\nDespite this new victory, Lautaro was again unable to pursue the opportunity due to the celebrations and beliefs of his people. By the time he arrived at Concepci\u00f3n, it was already abandoned. After burning it, he could not continue the offensive with his remaining forces, and the campaign came to an end as the warriors demobilized.\n\nIn [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], Villagra reorganized his forces, and that same year of 1554, he departed again for Arauco and reinforced the strongholds of Imperial and Valdivia, which allowed the garrisons and their Indian friends to make many raids on the surrounding Mapuche settlements, burning houses and fields and killing all they found. Resulting devastation produced a [[famine]] and an [[epidemic]] among the hostile Mapuche around those cities.<ref>According to Vivar, Cap. CXXVI, up to two thirds of the populations died between the famine and ''pestilencia''. Marmolejo, '''Historia''', Cap\u00edtulo XX, says deaths were somewhat less around Valdivia because the Mapuche took refuge in the mountains. Lobera, '''Chronica''', Cap\u00edtulo LI, says the famine lasted from 1554 into 1555 and some Indians resorted to [[cannibalism]]. Marmolejo says that in spring there was an \"pestilencia\" that the Mapuche called ''chavalongo'' and that the Spanish called ''dolor de cabeza'' identified as [[typhus|epidemic typhus]] ([http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0716-10182003020200018&script=sci_arttext Revista chilena de infectolog\u00eda]).

Alvarado attempted to defeat Lautaro's army outside the city then fled to the city pursued by Lautaro's army. Only 38 Spaniards managed to escape by sea from this second destruction of the city. Following this victory in 1556, the Promauces sent a message to the Mapuche of Arauco promising food to support their army and warriors to join it in a war against the Spanish in Santiago.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cr\u00f3nica y relaci\u00f3n copiosa y verdadera de los reinos de Chile |last=Vivar |first=Jer\u00f3nimo de |authorlink=Jer\u00f3nimo de Vivar |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=CXXVIII |quote= |url=http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/cronicas/contextos/10888.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Lautaro's campaigns against Santiago===\n[[File:El joven Lautaro - P.

A larger force under [[Pedro de Villagra]] later [[Battle of Peteroa|attacked the fortress at Peteroa]] over several days but were not able to take it and were forced away by flooding. However, with unfavorable losses and more Spaniards coming to Villagra's support, Lautaro retreated towards the [[Maule River]] hoping to establish himself there. However, the Spanish cavalry of [[Juan God\u00ed\u00f1ez]] pursued to the Maule River cutting down stragglers and one of Lautaro's detachments was cut to pieces. Lautaro's army gave them the slip, but was forced to fall back beyond the [[Itata River]]. Captain Gudi\u00f1ez returned victorious from this pursuit and put great fear into the Promaucaes by punishing them with destruction of their herds, fields and houses and by cutting off some heads, as a lesson not to call upon the Mapuche army or give aid to them.<ref name=Rosales>{{cite book |title=Historia general de el Reyno de Chile: Flandes Indiano (1554\u20131625) |last=Rosales |first=Diego de |authorlink=Diego de Rosales |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=B.II Ch.

The Spanish forces met without Lautaro being alerted and made a surprise night march over the hills of Caune, to the hill overlooking Lautaro's camp, on the shore of the Mataquito River.

He landed in La Serena and had the rival contenders for the governorship, Francisco de Villagra and [[Francisco de Aguirre (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguirre]] arrested and sent to Peru and put his own men in control of the province. Sending his cavalry by land he sailed south in winter and landed in early June 1557 on the island of [[La Quiriquina]] at the mouth of the Bay of Concepci\u00f3n. He ordered a party to land at Penco and reconstruct the fort of Concepci\u00f3n. A Mapuche army attempted to raze the fort but were defeated by artillery and gunfire. After his cavalry and horses arrived overland from Santiago, Mendoza began his advance to the south of the Bio-Bio and another Mapuche army including [[Galvarino (Mapuche)|Galvarino]] attempted to stop them in the open field in the [[Battle of Lagunillas]] but again were defeated after hard fighting and as a result their fortress at [[Andalic\u00e1n]] the gateway to [[Arauco Province|Arauco]] was left undefended and was captured soon after the battle.\n\nCaupolic\u00e1n led the Mapuche unsuccessfully resisting the advance of Hurtado de Mendoza by attacking him from ambush in the [[Battle of Millarapue]]. After further fighting near the site of the ruined fortress of Tucapel, Mendoza built the fort and city of [[Ca\u00f1ete, Chile|Ca\u00f1ete de la Frontera]] and continued to the south. There he established the city of [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]] and explored southward to the [[Gulf of Ancud]]. Attempting to throw off the Spanish occupation Caupolic\u00e1n attacked the fort of Ca\u00f1ete expecting the gates to be opened by the treachery of a ''[[yanakuna]]'' within but he was betrayed instead and was badly defeated by Captain [[Alonso de Reinoso]]. Although he was able to escape immediately after this last battle when Spanish cavalry did not arrive in time to pursue, he was eventually betrayed and captured in the mountains by [[Pedro de Avenda\u00f1o]], sentenced to death by Alonso de Reinoso and executed by [[impalement]] in Ca\u00f1ete.\n\nAfter the death of Caupolic\u00e1n, Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza thought that they had subjugated the Mapuche. On the contrary, the manner of the death of Caupolic\u00e1n inspired the Mapuches to continue the struggle with a [[guerrilla war]] in which there was no day that some yanaconas or once in a while some [[encomendero]] did not die at hands of Mapuches. When the number of missing or dead reached 400 yanaconas and 10 Spaniards, the governor was convinced that he had been mistaken. In [[Quiapo (Arauco, Chile)|Quiapo]], the Mapuches under their new toqui [[Caupolic\u00e1n the younger]] constructed a fort that was to stop the forces of Mendoza from marching into Arauco and rebuilding a fort there. Mendoza advanced from Ca\u00f1ete and crushed another Mapuche army at the [[Battle of Quiapo]]. After the battle, Hurtado de Mendoza had most of the captured Mapuche executed, but saved [[Peteguel\u00e9n]], son of Cuyomanque, an important cacique in the Arauco region. Through his help and that of the grateful father, he was able contact and to bring most of the leaders of Arauco and Tucapel to submit to Spanish rule following the reconstruction of the fort in Arauco.<ref name=\"Mari\u00f1oXI\">{{cite book |title=Cr\u00f3nica del Reino de Chile |last=Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |first=Pedro |authorlink=Pedro Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=XI |quote=Fuerte de San Felipe de Rauco |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/13582842323460728544424/p0000002.htm#I_72_}}</ref> Mendoza also founded the city of [[Angol|San Andr\u00e9s de Angol or Los Infantes]] not far from the old fort of Confines.\n\nIn February 1561, [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]] relieved Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, replacing him as governor with the victor over Lautaro, Francisco de Villagra. Mendoza left Chile with the belief that he had overcome the Mapuche. He was one of the few governors who obtained a certain degree of success in the War. This success was due to the large numbers of experienced soldiers, equipment and arms that he brought which were not available to the previous conquerors and because the Mapuche did not have a strategist to equal Lautaro.\n\nThe Mapuches pretended peace, but secretly continued to prepare for a new revolt. Soon after the defeat at Quiapo the surviving leaders gathered and elected [[Illanguli\u00e9n]] as the new toqui. With most of the nations warriors dead or wounded and the population decimated by the effects of war, starvation and disease he decided to retreat into the marshes of [[Lumaco]] and there gather their strength and train a new generation of warriors for a future revolt. The Mapuche had learned to work iron, use Spanish weapons (including firearms and cannon), ride horses captured from their conquerors and learned better strategies and tactics. The defeats inflicted by Mendoza had made the Mapuche a united people and one committed to renewing the war against the Spanish to secure independence.\n\n==Second Great Mapuche Rebellion (1561)==\n===Campaigns of Francisco de Villagra===\nHostilities resumed with the arrival of Francisco de Villagra to replace Mendoza. It began during the brief interim governorship of [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]] with the killing of the hated encomendero and corregidor of Ca\u00f1ete Pedro de Avenda\u00f1o and two other Spaniards in July 1561 in the valley of Puren. Spanish punitive expeditions from Angol and La Imperial drove the insurgents into the refuge of the Lumaco marshes. However, the news of the killing was spread by the Mapuches and it initiated a new general rising greater than the previous ones. With Villagra's arrival also came its first [[smallpox]] epidemic that ravaged the native population of Chile.\n\nThe toqui of the Arauco region, [[Millalelmo]], with a local army laid [[siege]] to Arauco from May 20 to June 30, 1562.<ref name=\"G\u00f3ngora\">{{cite book |title=Historia de Chile desde su descubrimiento hasta el a\u00f1o 1575 |last=G\u00f3ngora Marmolejo |first=Alonso de |authorlink=Alonso de G\u00f3ngora Marmolejo |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=XL |quote= |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/bameric/02582741011358306311291/p0000003.htm#I_41_}}</ref> At the end of 1562, the Mapuches under a leader named Meuco, had fortified a pucar\u00e1 in the province of Mareguano, three leagues from the city of Los Infantes.<ref name=\"Mari\u00f1oXVII\">{{cite book |title=Cr\u00f3nica del Reino de Chile |last=Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |first=Pedro |authorlink=Pedro Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=XVII |quote= |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/13582842323460728544424/p0000003.htm#I_81_}}</ref> Arias Pardo Maldonado destroyed the pucar\u00e1 but he did not gain a complete victory, since most of the Mapuches escaped. Elsewhere the corregidor of Ca\u00f1ete Juan Lazarte was killed at the gates of Ca\u00f1ete trying to recapture mounts stolen by thirty mapuches.\n\nThe Mapuches reconstructed the pucar\u00e1 near Los Infantes in January 1563, but Pedro de Villagra was sent again to destroy it. Once again the Mapuche rebuilt it, but this time with sections readily accessible to the cavalry, despite suspicions of veteran Spaniards they attacked the location, and many fell into well-disguised pits. There the governor's son, Pedro de Villagra \"el Mozo\" and forty two other Spaniards died. This disastrous military defeat forced governor Francisco de Villagra to order the city of Ca\u00f1ete to be abandoned. News of the abandonment of Ca\u00f1ete spread the revolt.\n\nWhen Francisco de Villagra heard the news of his son's death he became ill and left for Concepcion leaving his cousin, Pedro de Villagra, in charge of the campaign. The Mapuches, now under [[Colocolo (tribal chief)|Colocolo]] attacked on two fronts against the forts of Los Infantes and Arauco [[Investment (military)|investing]] them but were unable to take them. Again Peteg\u00fcelen offered peace to the Spaniards and Villagra accepted, but this peace was deceptive since the Mapuches needed to harvest their fields.\n\nIn April 1563, the Mapuche reestablished the siege of Arauco. This lasted 42 days with the Mapuches losing 500 warriors mostly from [[dysentery]] contracted from drinking contaminated water. Finally they chose to retire and to raise the siege. Shortly afterward, Francisco de Villagra died in Concepcion on June 22, 1563, leaving his cousin Pedro de Villagra as interim governor.\n\n=== Campaigns of Pedro de Villagra ===\nBecause he believed he had too few men to hold all the posts in Mapuche territory and still have a field army the new governor Pedro de Villagra ordered the abandonment of Arauco in July 1563, taking off its artillery and noncombatants by sea while garrison under [[Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado]] marched over the rain soaked mountains and flooded rivers to Angol. The Mapuche destroyed the fort shortly after the garrison left and harassed their march. Regarding the abandonment of Arauco as a victory, it inspired the Mapuche north of the Bio-bio River to revolt.\n\nIn 1564, Pedro de Villagra, took measures to protect all the towns and forts he still held and gathered a field army in Concepcion drawn from all these posts. He knew that one of the Mapuche objectives was to surround Concepcion and preparations were made to support a long [[siege]]. After a brief fight [[Loble]] defeated the troops of captain [[Francisco de Vaca]] in the Itata River valley who were coming with reinforcements from Santiago. In addition, [[Millalelmo]] ambushed Spanish reinforcements coming from Angol to the south under captain, [[Juan Perez de Zurita]], at a crossing of the [[Andali\u00e9n River]].<ref>Marmolejo, Historia..., Cap\u00edtulo XLV, located just two leagues south of the city. Lobera, '''Cr\u00f3nica...,''' Libro segundo, Parte segunda, Cap\u00edtulo XXIII, calls the place ''Levocatal''.</ref> Both defeats cut off the city and garrison of Concepcion from outside aid by land. The defeated survivors had to retreat to Santiago and were in no condition to break through the [[Investment (military)|investment]] around Concepcion. On the other hand, encouraged by these victories in the north, Illanguli\u00e9n resolved to destroy [[Angol|Los Infantes]] before marching to Concepcion.\n\nAt Los Infantes the Mapuche blockade grew tighter as they moved closer and closer to the city protected in their well-sited pucaras. Its commander Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado judged them too well defended to attack until they started to build their third pucara close to the city. Then in the [[Battle of Angol]] Lorenzo Bernal drove the Mapuche army out of their pucara and pursued them down to the river and pushed them back into it killing Illanguli\u00e9n and a thousand of his men with many others wounded or captured and the rest of the army dispersed. Afterward [[Paillataru]] was elected as Toqui.\n\nMeanwhile, the caciques Millalelmu and Loble with 20,000 warriors from the area between the Itata and Bio-Bio rivers, settled down to the [[Siege of Concepcion]] in February 1564. The Mapuche entered the city, sacking and burning it, crowding all its population within the walls of its fortress with its garrison under Pedro de Villagra. The siege lasted around two months until at the end of March two ships arrived and brought food that would permit the siege to continue for a much longer time. On the other side the Mapuche had used up local sources of food and were finding it difficult to maintain their large force. With the harvest season coming and with the news of their defeat in the Battle of Angol, they were nervous that their families might starve or their undefended homes might be attacked from Angol or Santiago. They raised their siege on April 1, and dispersed to their homes for the winter.<ref>[[Diego Barros Arana]], '''Historia General De Chile''', Tomo Segundo, Parte Tercera La Colonia desde 1561 hasta 1610, Capitulo Segundo Sec. 4</ref>\n\nAfter the siege was raised Villagra became aware of an effort to replace him as governor by Martin Ruiz de Gamboa, son-in-law of Rodrigo de Quiroga. Villagra tried to arrest Gamboa who fled overland to Santiago but Villagra sailed to [[Valpara\u00edso]] in a few days with some of his men and arrested him in Santiago when he arrived. Villagra then tried to reorganize the surviving disheartened troops of Vaca and Zurita in Santiago and take them south in October 1564. But he was delayed much longer, spending heavily from the impoverished provincial treasury and contributions exacted from the cities of Chile with difficulty, he slowly refitted and enlarged his army over the winter and spring.\n\nVillagra left the city in mid-January 1565, with 110 Spaniards and gathered 800 Indian auxiliaries from their [[repartimientos]] as he marched south to the Maule River. There he linked up with 30 Spaniards under [[Pedro Hernandez de Cordova]] who were observing the frontier with the Mapuche after the Mapuche had blocked their prior attempt to reinforce Concepcion. During the seven months Villagra was in Santiago, the Mapuche north of the Bio-Bio had built a strong pucara on the [[Perquilauqu\u00e9n River]], blocking the road south to Concepcion and in the [[Second Battle of Reinohuel\u00e9n]] Villagra rapidly took it and destroyed the Mapuche army holding it. Soon afterward Villagra ambushed Loble as he was bringing reinforcements and unaware of the defeat he was surprised defeated and captured. Subsequently, Villagra established fort ''[[Chill\u00e1n Viejo|San Ildefonso]]'' in the region and was able to suppress the Mapuche revolt north of the Bio-Bio.\n\n=== War during the rule of the Real Audiencia of Chile ===\nShortly after the end of the campaign Pedro de Villagra was replaced at the order of the [[Lope Garc\u00eda de Castro|Viceroy of Peru]] by [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]] as the temporary governor in 1565. Quiroga launched a new campaign, organized by [[Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado]] who reconstructed [[Ca\u00f1ete, Chile|Ca\u00f1ete]], and repopulated [[Arauco, Chile|Arauco]] in 1566. He accomplished the conquest of the island of [[Chilo\u00e9 Island|Chilo\u00e9]], sending [[Mart\u00edn Ruiz de Gamboa]] to establish the city of [[Castro, Chile|Castro]] there, and pacify its inhabitants, the [[Cuncos]]. Quiroga returned to find he was to be replaced by the [[Royal Audiencia of Concepci\u00f3n|Real Audiencia of Concepcion]] in August 1567. In September 1567, the king named [[Melchor Bravo de Saravia|Melchor Bravo de Saravia y Sotomayor]] to take over the civil and military government of Chile, with the title of governor and he arrived from [[Lima]] in 1568.\n\n== Campaigns between 1568 and 1598 ==\nDespite having founded cities and forts in Mapuche territory, all further Spanish conquest attempts failed. The [[Captaincy General of Chile]] became a problematic region of continual warfare where it became increasingly difficult to get soldiers to serve. The Spaniards would possibly have abandoned it if they not feared its colonization by another European nation. Several Spanish generals and nobles were assigned posts in Chile in an attempt to finish the war with the Mapuche.\n\n=== Campaigns during the governorship of Melchor Bravo de Saravia ===\nGovernor [[Melchor Bravo de Saravia|Melchor Bravo de Saravia y Sotomayor]] arrived from Lima in 1568 and recruited 100 new soldiers and gathered food in Santiago province and marched south to join the army near the mouth of the [[Tavolevo River]] in [[Catirai]].\n\nToqui [[Llanganabal]]\n\n[[Battle of Catirai]]\n\n[[1570 Concepci\u00f3n earthquake]]\n\n[[Pailacar]]\n\n[[Battle of Pur\u00e9n]]\n\nToqui [[Paine\u00f1amcu]] or Alonso Diaz\n\n=== Campaigns of Rodrigo de Quiroga and Mart\u00edn Ruiz de Gamboa ===\nGovernor [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]]\n\n[[1575 Valdivia earthquake]]\n\n[[Juan de Leb\u00fa]]\n\nGovernor [[Mart\u00edn Ruiz de Gamboa]]\n\n[[Tasa de Gamboa]]\n\n=== Campaigns of Alonso de Sotomayor ===\nGovernor [[Alonso de Sotomayor]] arrived in Chile in 1583 and had to judge accusations against his predecessor, who had become extremely unpopular for the Tasa de Gamboa which had prohibited the payment of taxes by the Indians in the form of labor. Sotomayor later absolved Gamboa entirely but abolished the Tasa de Gamboa and reinstituted the [[Tasa de Santill\u00e1n]], with new provisions to humanize the old system, in an attempt to avoid the excesses of the encomenderos against the Indians.\n\nDespite his early successful campaign when he captured Alonso Diaz in 1584, he wanted to extend the conquest of Chile by building a series of forts which would protect each other, the cities and their surrounding lands. They were also to hem in the Moluche and become the secure bases of future campaigns. In 1584, Sotomayor founded the fort of [[San Fabi\u00e1n de Conueo]] in [[Coelemu]] securing communications between Santiago and Concepcion. In 1585 he ordered the construction of forts around [[Catirai]], [[Santo Arbol de la Cruz]] where the [[Guaqui River]] enters the Bio Bio River, [[Esp\u00edritu Santo (fort)|Esp\u00edritu Santo]] near the mouth of the [[Tavolevo River]] with [[Sant\u00edsima Trinidad (fort)|Sant\u00edsima Trinidad]] directly across the Bio Bio River and in the upper reaches of the [[Culenco River]], fort [[San Jer\u00f3nimo de Millapoa]]. In [[Pur\u00e9n]] he also raised another fort, where he placed a small garrison.\n\nOpposing these moves by Sotomayor was the Toqui [[Cayancaru]] who attempted a siege of the fort at Arauco that failed, leading to his abdication of his office in favor of his son [[Nangoniel]] in 1585. Nangoniel returned to invest Arauco again, his cavalry (operating with the army for the first time) prevented the Spaniards from supplying the fort and they were forced to evacuate it. He next moved against the Sant\u00edsima Trinidad but clashed with a division of Spanish troops, under Francisco Hernandez, where he was wounded and soon hunted down and killed. [[Cadeguala]] was proclaimed Toqui in his place the same day and began operations against Angol, breaking into the city, however he was repulsed by a counterattack. He followed this with a siege of Pur\u00e9n the following year. He drove off a relief force with his cavalry and offered the garrison terms but was refused. He next challenged the commander of the fort, [[Alonso Garc\u00eda de Ram\u00f3n]], to single combat to decide the fate of the fortress. The two leaders fought on horseback with lances, and Cadeguala fell, killed by his opponent. His army raised the siege but after electing [[Guanoalca]] as toqui returned to successfully drive the poorly supplied Spanish from Pur\u00e9n and burned it in 1586.\n\n[[Puta\u00e9n]]\n\n[[Janequeo (lonco)|Janequeo]]\n\n[[Fort Liv\u00e9n]]\n\nMeanwhile, Sotomayor had the distraction of an attack by [[England|English]] [[pirates]] under [[Thomas Cavendish]]. When they anchored in [[Quintero]] on April 9, 1587, he was defeated by the Spanish, losing 10 men and continued up the coast of [[South America]].\n\nSotomayor rebuilt Pur\u00e9n in 1589 and built a new fort on the heights of [[Marihue\u00f1u]]. Guanoalca directed his army against the new Spanish fort but finding it too strongly held, diverted his attacks against Esp\u00edritu Santo and the fort of Sant\u00edsima Trinidad on the opposite shore of the Bio Bio River.\n\nToqui [[Quintuguenu]]\n\nToqui [[Paillaeco]]\n\nToqui [[Paillamachu]]\n\nGovernor [[Pedro de Viscarra]]\n\n==Third Great Mapuche Rebellion (1598)==\n=== Campaigns of Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda O\u00f1ez de Loyola ===\nIn September 1592, [[Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda \u00d3\u00f1ez de Loyola]], famous for his capture of [[T\u00fapac Amaru]] was appointed as [[Captain General]] directly by Philip II, who thought him the most likely candidate to finish the Arauco War. Loyola insisted in penetrating Mapuche territory with an army of soldiers coming directly from Panama. He established fort [[Santa Cruz de O\u00f1ez]] on the [[Rele River]] near the confluence of the Bio-Bio and [[Laja River (Chile)|Laja River]]s in May 1594. The fort was elevated to the rank of city in 1595 giving it the name of [[Santa Cruz de Coya]]. Later, on 21 December 1598, O\u00f1ez de Loyola became the second governor of Chile to die in war with the Mapuches, surprised by [[Pelantaro]] in the [[Disaster of Curalaba]].\n\n=== Mapuche Uprising of 1598 ===\n{{Main|Destruction of Seven Cities}}\nThe Disaster of Curalaba became the beginning of a general uprising that resulted in a six-year struggle called the [[Destruction of the Seven Cities]] that eliminated all Spanish settlements south of the [[Bio-Bio River]] with the exception of those in [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago]]. The viceroy of Peru hastily appointed [[Francisco de Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez]] as replacement for the deceased Loyola. He was an experienced military man with great prudence but with little aptitude for the crisis that he was called upon to face. This governor discovered the terrible state of the colony and asked urgently for reinforcements. Meanwhile, he tried to support those places that were possible to defend. Nevertheless, things were soon out of his control despite everything done to stabilize the situation, and he sickened and asked for his relief.\n\nOver the next few years, the Mapuche were able to destroy or force the abandonment of many cities and minor settlements including all the seven Spanish cities in Mapuche territory south of the Bio Bio River: [[Santa Cruz de Coya]] (1599), [[Valdivia, Chile|Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca de Valdivia]] (1599), [[Angol|San Andr\u00e9s de Los Infantes]] (1599), [[La Imperial, Chile|La Imperial]] (1600), [[Villarrica, Chile|Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena de Villa Rica]] (1602), [[Osorno, Chile|San Mateo de Osorno]] (1603), and [[Arauco, Chile|San Felipe de Araucan]] (1604).\n\n== Mapuche Insurrection of 1655 ==\n  {{Main|Mapuche Insurrection of 1655}}\n\nThe [[Mapuche Insurrection of 1655|last major uprising]] came on February 14, 1655 when Mapuche forces under [[Clentaru]] rose up against the Spaniards and pushed back the forces of governor [[Francisco Antonio de Acu\u00f1a Cabrera y Bayona]].<ref name=\"Elliot1907\">{{cite book|author=George Francis Scott Elliot|title=Chile: Its History and Development, Natural Features, Products, Commerce and Present Conditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ab4-AAAAYAAJ|year=1907|publisher=C.

The conflict begun at first as a reaction to the Spanish conquest attempt establishing cities and forcing Mapuches into [[encomienda|servitude]]. It subsequently evolved over time into phases of [[low intensity warfare]], drawn-out [[siege]]s, [[Slave raiding|slave-hunting expeditions]], [[pillaging]] raids, [[punitive expedition]]s and renewed Spanish attempts to secure lost territories. [[Raptio|Abduction of women]] and [[war rape]] was common on both sides.<ref name=Luz2013>{{Cite journal|title=Las cautivas de las Sitece Ciudades: El cautiverio de mujeres hispanocriollas durante la Guerra de Arauco, en la perspectiva de cuatro cronistas (s.

From the 17th to the late 18th century a series of parliaments were held between royal governors and Mapuche [[lonko]]s and the war devolved to sporadic pillaging carried out by Spanish soldiers as well as Mapuches and [[Banditry in Chile|outlaws]].\n\nThe [[Chilean War of Independence]] brought new hostilities to the frontier, with different factions of Spaniards, Chileans and Mapuches fighting for independence, royalism or personal gain. Mapuche independence finally ended with the Chilean [[occupation of Araucan\u00eda]] between 1861 and 1883. The modern [[Mapuche conflict]] is partially inspired by the Arauco War.\n\n==Causes==\nInitially, the key area of conflict that the Spanish attempted to secure south of [[B\u00edo B\u00edo River]] were the valleys around [[Cordillera de Nahuelbuta]]. The Spanish designs for this region was to exploit the [[placer deposit]]s of gold using unfree Mapuche labour from the densely populated nearby valleys.<ref name=Zavala2014>{{cite book |last=Zavala C. |first=Jos\u00e9 Manuel |date=2014|editor-last=Dillehay|editor-first=Tom |title=The Teleoscopic Polity|chapter=The Spanish-Araucanian World of the Pur\u00e9n and Lumaco Valley in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries |location= |publisher=Springer |pages=55\u201373 |isbn=978-3-319-03128-6 |editor-link=Tom Dillehay }}</ref> To serve the Spanish in gold mining was a deadly activity that killed many Mapuches.<ref name=BengoaAntiguo252-253/> Lacking a tradition of [[forced labour]] like the Andean [[mita (Inca)|mita]] the Mapuches largely refused to serve the Spanish setting the stage for the conflict.<ref name=BengoaAntiguo252-253>Bengoa 2003, pp. 252\u2013253.</ref> \n\nOn the other hand, the Spanish, in particular those from [[Old Castile|Castile]] and [[Extremadura]], came from an extremely violent society.<ref name=BengoaAntiguo261>Bengoa 2003, p. 261.</ref> According to [[Diego de Rosales]] Mapuche chief [[Lientur]] would have explained that he preferred to \"die warriing, than in a bad peace\".<ref name=Luz2013/> Analysing the situation in the 1650s the [[Real Audiencia of Santiago]] opined that [[slavery of Mapuches]] was one of the reasons for constant state of war between the Spanish and the Mapuches.<ref name=Barana342>Barros Arana 2000, p. 342.</ref>\n\n==Spanish conquest==\nAn antecedent of the Arauco War was the [[Battle of Reynog\u00fcel\u00e9n (1536)|Battle of Reynog\u00fcel\u00e9n]], which occurred in 1536 between a detachment of [[Diego de Almagro]]'s expedition and a large group of Mapuches, near the confluence of the [[\u00d1uble River|\u00d1uble]] and [[Itata River|Itata]] rivers. The beginning of the war comes with the campaigns of conquest of [[Pedro de Valdivia]].\n\n===Campaigns of Pedro de Valdivia (1546\u20131553)===\n[[Image:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pedro de Valdivia]]]]\n[[File:Ines de Suarez 2.JPG|thumb|upright|Do\u00f1a [[In\u00e9s de Su\u00e1rez]] in defending the city of Santiago]]\nDuring the early phase of the [[Conquest of Chile]], the Spanish [[conquistador]] Pedro de Valdivia conducted a nine-year campaign to secure the city of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], which had been [[Destruction of Santiago|destroyed on September 11, 1541]] by the [[Mapochoes]] under the direction of their chief, [[Michimalonco]]. Valdivia hoped to enlarge the territory under his jurisdiction and, despite injuries from a fall from his horse, resolved to take personal command of a land expedition into [[Araucan\u00eda (historic region)|Araucan\u00eda]].\n\nIn 1544, a naval expedition was sent, comprising the [[Barque|bark]]s, ''San Pedro'' and ''Santiaguillo'', under the command of [[Juan Bautista Pastene]], to reconnoiter the southwestern coast of South America to the [[Strait of Magellan]]. The expedition set sail from [[Valpara\u00edso]], entered the [[Bay of Concepci\u00f3n|bay of San Pedro]], and made landings at what is now known as [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]] and at [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]], which was later named in honor of the commander. Encountering severe storms further south, he then returned to Valparaiso.\n\nValdivia himself set out in 1546, with sixty horsemen plus guides and porters, and crossed the [[Itata River]] and were attacked by [[Mapuche]] warriors in the [[Battle of Quilacura]] near the [[B\u00edo-B\u00edo River]]. Realizing that it would be impossible to proceed in such hostile territory with so limited a force, Valdivia elected to return to Santiago after finding a site for a new city at what is now [[Penco]] and that would become the first site of [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]].\n\n===Founding of Concepci\u00f3n, Imperial, and Valdivia===\nIn 1550, a new expedition was launched, consisting of a naval force under Pastene, and a land force of two hundred Spaniards mounted and foot and a number of [[Mapochoes|Mapocho]] auxiliaries under Valdivia. They planned to reunite on the shores of the Bay of Concepci\u00f3n. The expedition advanced beyond the [[Itata River]] and [[Laja River (Chile)|Laja River]], to the shores of the [[B\u00edo-B\u00edo River]]. Along the way they had several battles with groups of [[Mapuche]]s as they explored the region killing many with little loss to themselves. After spending over a week in the area and encountering increasing opposition, the Spanish marched toward the Sea through the valleys of the Laja and B\u00edo-B\u00edo rivers, towards the coast at Penco. On the banks of the [[Andali\u00e9n River]], they camped for two days between the river and a lake, where they were attacked on the second night by a large force of [[Mapuche|Araucanians]] under their [[toqui]] [[Ainavillo]] in the [[Battle of Andalien]]. The night attack was defeated in a furious battle, the Spaniards suffered one killed and many wounds to men and especially their mounts. After a day treating their wounds they continued towards their rendezvous at the Bay of Concepci\u00f3n.<ref name=Valdivia>[[Pedro de Valdivia]], '''Carta 15 de octubre de 1550'''</ref><ref>[[Jer\u00f3nimo de Vivar]], '''Cr\u00f3nica y relaci\u00f3n copiosa y verdadera de los reinos de Chile''', Cap\u00edtulo XCIV and XCV; [[Alonso de G\u00f3ngora Marmolejo]], '''Historia''' Cap\u00edtulo X; [[Pedro Mari\u00f1o de Lobera]], '''Cr\u00f3nica del Reino de Chile''', Cap\u00edtulo XXXI</ref> There Valdivia began building a fort at what is now Penco.\n\nOn February 23, Pastene's fleet anchored in the bay, brought supplies, reinforcements and provided materials to finish the fort.<ref name=Valdivia/> On March 1 Valdivia founded here the city of [[Penco|Concepci\u00f3n del Nuevo Extremo]].

This force was broken and routed despite the small size of the Spanish forces.<ref name=Valdivia/><ref>Vivar, '''Cr\u00f3nica''' Cap\u00edtulo XCVII; Marmolejo, '''Historia''' Cap\u00edtulo XI; Lobera, '''Cr\u00f3nica''' Cap\u00edtulo XXXIII</ref>  Despite the resulting submission of the local tribes, Valdivia sent an emissary to the [[Viceroy of Peru]], asking for additional forces; he knew that it would not be possible to complete the conquest of [[Araucan\u00eda (historic region)|Araucan\u00eda]] with only the forces at his disposal. After reinforcement at Concepci\u00f3n in 1551, he organized another expedition to establish the fort [[Carahue|La Imperial]] on the banks of the [[Imperial River (Chile)|Imperial River]]. He then returned to Concepci\u00f3n to prepare another expedition and await the reinforcements the Viceroy had promised to send by sea.\n\nLeaving orders that the new troops should disembark on the ''Tierras de Valdivia'' that Pastene had discovered earlier, Valdivia left with two hundred soldiers in the direction of Fort Imperial. Once he had passed it on his way south, he ordered [[Jer\u00f3nimo de Alderete]] to drive inland and establish a fort, with the goal of securing his eastern flank. To this end, Alderente reached [[Lake Villarrica]] and established [[Villarrica, Chile|a fort]] there. Meanwhile, Valdivia's column advanced southwards and joined the reinforcements sent from [[Peru]], under the command of [[Francisco de Villagra]]. There, the city of [[Valdivia, Chile|Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca de Valdivia]] was established. After garrisoning these new places, Valdivia returned to his base at Concepci\u00f3n in 1552 where rich [[placer gold]] mines were found in the [[Quilacoya River]] valley.\n\n==First Great Mapuche Rebellion (1553)==\n[[File:Grabado Caupolican-Nicanor Plaza.jpg|thumbnail|Caupolican by [[Nicanor Plaza]]]]\n\n=== Lautaro and the Battle of Tucapel ===\nWith the goal of securing the lines of communication with the southern forts, Valdivia launched a third expedition which established forts at [[Tucapel]], [[Pur\u00e9n]], [[Angol|Confines]] and [[Arauco, Chile|Arauco]]. The Araucanians didn't offer any resistance to the conquistadors in their fort-building. In October 1553, the Quilacoya gold mine was opened and large numbers of Mapuche were forced to work in it.\n\nIn 1553, the Mapuches held a council at which, because of the growth of Spanish forces in their territory, they resolved to make war. They chose as their \"[[toqui]]\" (wartime chief) an extraordinarily strong man called [[Caupolic\u00e1n]] and as his vice toqui [[Lautaro (toqui)|Lautaro]], because he had served as an auxiliary to the Spanish cavalry, his experiences with the Spanish gave him insight into the best methods for fighting the conquistadors.\n\nWith six thousand warriors under his command, Lautaro attacked the fort at [[Tucapel]]. The Spanish garrison was unable to withstand the assault and retreated to [[Pur\u00e9n]] and Lautaro seized and burned the fort and prepared his army certain that the Spaniards would attempt to retake Tucapel. Valdivia, with a reduced force, mounted a counter-attack, but he was quickly surrounded and his army was massacred by the Mapuches in the [[Battle of Tucapel]]. This was Pedro de Valdivia's last battle; he was captured and later killed in captivity when he refused to concede defeat.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cr\u00f3nica y relaci\u00f3n copiosa y verdadera de los reinos de Chile |last=Vivar |first=Jer\u00f3nimo de |authorlink=Jer\u00f3nimo de Vivar |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=CXVI |quote=...ayer mataron al apo y todos los cristianos que con \u00e9l ven\u00edan, que no escap\u00f3 ninguno, y todos los yanaconas de servicio, si no eran los que se hab\u00edan escondido |url=http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/cronicas/contextos/10876.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Campaigns of Caupolic\u00e1n and Lautaro (1554\u20131557)===\n[[Image:Espanoles guerreando en chile ovalle.jpg|thumb|Picture from [[Alonso de Ovalle]]'s ''Historia de Chile'']]\nAfter the defeat at Tucapel, the [[Spain|Spanish]] hurriedly reorganized their forces, reinforcing fort Imperial for its defence and abandoning Confines and Arauco in order to strengthen Concepci\u00f3n. However, Araucanian tradition dictated a lengthy victory celebration, which kept Lautaro from exploiting the weakness of the Spanish position as he desired. It was only in February 1554 that he succeeded in putting together an army of 8,000 men, just in time to confront a [[punitive expedition]] under the command of [[Francisco de Villagra]] at the [[Battle of Marihue\u00f1u]].\n\nDespite this new victory, Lautaro was again unable to pursue the opportunity due to the celebrations and beliefs of his people. By the time he arrived at Concepci\u00f3n, it was already abandoned. After burning it, he could not continue the offensive with his remaining forces, and the campaign came to an end as the warriors demobilized.\n\nIn [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], Villagra reorganized his forces, and that same year of 1554, he departed again for Arauco and reinforced the strongholds of Imperial and Valdivia, which allowed the garrisons and their Indian friends to make many raids on the surrounding Mapuche settlements, burning houses and fields and killing all they found. Resulting devastation produced a [[famine]] and an [[epidemic]] among the hostile Mapuche around those cities.<ref>According to Vivar, Cap. CXXVI, up to two thirds of the populations died between the famine and ''pestilencia''. Marmolejo, '''Historia''', Cap\u00edtulo XX, says deaths were somewhat less around Valdivia because the Mapuche took refuge in the mountains. Lobera, '''Chronica''', Cap\u00edtulo LI, says the famine lasted from 1554 into 1555 and some Indians resorted to [[cannibalism]]. Marmolejo says that in spring there was an \"pestilencia\" that the Mapuche called ''chavalongo'' and that the Spanish called ''dolor de cabeza'' identified as [[typhus|epidemic typhus]] ([http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0716-10182003020200018&script=sci_arttext Revista chilena de infectolog\u00eda]). Vivar claims the ''pestilencia'' was caused by the cannibalism. Lobera makes no mention of an epidemic.</ref> Meanwhile, in the north during 1554, news of the victories of Lautauro lead to uprisings by the previously subdued [[Promaucaes]] in the valley of the [[Mataquito River]] and the [[Picunche]] in the valley of the [[Aconcagua River]] but these were put down.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cr\u00f3nica y relaci\u00f3n copiosa y verdadera de los reinos de Chile |last=Vivar |first=Jer\u00f3nimo de |authorlink=Jer\u00f3nimo de Vivar |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=CXXVIII |quote=[[Juan Jufr\u00e9]] led a small band of horsemen from Santiago in crushing the revolt in [[Gualemo]] on the [[Lontu\u00e9 River]]  |url=http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/cronicas/contextos/10888.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1555, the [[Real Audiencia]] in [[Lima]], ordered Villagra to reconstruct Concepci\u00f3n, which was accomplished by Capitan Alvarado and 75 colonists. When he learned that it was being rebuilt, Lautaro again attacked Concepci\u00f3n with 4,000 warriors. Alvarado attempted to defeat Lautaro's army outside the city then fled to the city pursued by Lautaro's army. Only 38 Spaniards managed to escape by sea from this second destruction of the city. Following this victory in 1556, the Promauces sent a message to the Mapuche of Arauco promising food to support their army and warriors to join it in a war against the Spanish in Santiago.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cr\u00f3nica y relaci\u00f3n copiosa y verdadera de los reinos de Chile |last=Vivar |first=Jer\u00f3nimo de |authorlink=Jer\u00f3nimo de Vivar |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=CXXVIII |quote= |url=http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/cronicas/contextos/10888.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Lautaro's campaigns against Santiago===\n[[File:El joven Lautaro - P.

A larger force under [[Pedro de Villagra]] later [[Battle of Peteroa|attacked the fortress at Peteroa]] over several days but were not able to take it and were forced away by flooding. However, with unfavorable losses and more Spaniards coming to Villagra's support, Lautaro retreated towards the [[Maule River]] hoping to establish himself there. However, the Spanish cavalry of [[Juan God\u00ed\u00f1ez]] pursued to the Maule River cutting down stragglers and one of Lautaro's detachments was cut to pieces. Lautaro's army gave them the slip, but was forced to fall back beyond the [[Itata River]]. Captain Gudi\u00f1ez returned victorious from this pursuit and put great fear into the Promaucaes by punishing them with destruction of their herds, fields and houses and by cutting off some heads, as a lesson not to call upon the Mapuche army or give aid to them.<ref name=Rosales>{{cite book |title=Historia general de el Reyno de Chile: Flandes Indiano (1554\u20131625) |last=Rosales |first=Diego de |authorlink=Diego de Rosales |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=B.II Ch.

He landed in La Serena and had the rival contenders for the governorship, Francisco de Villagra and [[Francisco de Aguirre (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguirre]] arrested and sent to Peru and put his own men in control of the province. Sending his cavalry by land he sailed south in winter and landed in early June 1557 on the island of [[La Quiriquina]] at the mouth of the Bay of Concepci\u00f3n. He ordered a party to land at Penco and reconstruct the fort of Concepci\u00f3n. A Mapuche army attempted to raze the fort but were defeated by artillery and gunfire. After his cavalry and horses arrived overland from Santiago, Mendoza began his advance to the south of the Bio-Bio and another Mapuche army including [[Galvarino (Mapuche)|Galvarino]] attempted to stop them in the open field in the [[Battle of Lagunillas]] but again were defeated after hard fighting and as a result their fortress at [[Andalic\u00e1n]] the gateway to [[Arauco Province|Arauco]] was left undefended and was captured soon after the battle.\n\nCaupolic\u00e1n led the Mapuche unsuccessfully resisting the advance of Hurtado de Mendoza by attacking him from ambush in the [[Battle of Millarapue]]. After further fighting near the site of the ruined fortress of Tucapel, Mendoza built the fort and city of [[Ca\u00f1ete, Chile|Ca\u00f1ete de la Frontera]] and continued to the south. There he established the city of [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]] and explored southward to the [[Gulf of Ancud]]. Attempting to throw off the Spanish occupation Caupolic\u00e1n attacked the fort of Ca\u00f1ete expecting the gates to be opened by the treachery of a ''[[yanakuna]]'' within but he was betrayed instead and was badly defeated by Captain [[Alonso de Reinoso]]. Although he was able to escape immediately after this last battle when Spanish cavalry did not arrive in time to pursue, he was eventually betrayed and captured in the mountains by [[Pedro de Avenda\u00f1o]], sentenced to death by Alonso de Reinoso and executed by [[impalement]] in Ca\u00f1ete.\n\nAfter the death of Caupolic\u00e1n, Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza thought that they had subjugated the Mapuche. On the contrary, the manner of the death of Caupolic\u00e1n inspired the Mapuches to continue the struggle with a [[guerrilla war]] in which there was no day that some yanaconas or once in a while some [[encomendero]] did not die at hands of Mapuches. When the number of missing or dead reached 400 yanaconas and 10 Spaniards, the governor was convinced that he had been mistaken. In [[Quiapo (Arauco, Chile)|Quiapo]], the Mapuches under their new toqui [[Caupolic\u00e1n the younger]] constructed a fort that was to stop the forces of Mendoza from marching into Arauco and rebuilding a fort there. Mendoza advanced from Ca\u00f1ete and crushed another Mapuche army at the [[Battle of Quiapo]]. After the battle, Hurtado de Mendoza had most of the captured Mapuche executed, but saved [[Peteguel\u00e9n]], son of Cuyomanque, an important cacique in the Arauco region. Through his help and that of the grateful father, he was able contact and to bring most of the leaders of Arauco and Tucapel to submit to Spanish rule following the reconstruction of the fort in Arauco.<ref name=\"Mari\u00f1oXI\">{{cite book |title=Cr\u00f3nica del Reino de Chile |last=Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |first=Pedro |authorlink=Pedro Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=XI |quote=Fuerte de San Felipe de Rauco |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/13582842323460728544424/p0000002.htm#I_72_}}</ref> Mendoza also founded the city of [[Angol|San Andr\u00e9s de Angol or Los Infantes]] not far from the old fort of Confines.\n\nIn February 1561, [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]] relieved Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, replacing him as governor with the victor over Lautaro, Francisco de Villagra. Mendoza left Chile with the belief that he had overcome the Mapuche. He was one of the few governors who obtained a certain degree of success in the War. This success was due to the large numbers of experienced soldiers, equipment and arms that he brought which were not available to the previous conquerors and because the Mapuche did not have a strategist to equal Lautaro.\n\nThe Mapuches pretended peace, but secretly continued to prepare for a new revolt. Soon after the defeat at Quiapo the surviving leaders gathered and elected [[Illanguli\u00e9n]] as the new toqui. With most of the nations warriors dead or wounded and the population decimated by the effects of war, starvation and disease he decided to retreat into the marshes of [[Lumaco]] and there gather their strength and train a new generation of warriors for a future revolt. The Mapuche had learned to work iron, use Spanish weapons (including firearms and cannon), ride horses captured from their conquerors and learned better strategies and tactics. The defeats inflicted by Mendoza had made the Mapuche a united people and one committed to renewing the war against the Spanish to secure independence.\n\n==Second Great Mapuche Rebellion (1561)==\n===Campaigns of Francisco de Villagra===\nHostilities resumed with the arrival of Francisco de Villagra to replace Mendoza. It began during the brief interim governorship of [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]] with the killing of the hated encomendero and corregidor of Ca\u00f1ete Pedro de Avenda\u00f1o and two other Spaniards in July 1561 in the valley of Puren. Spanish punitive expeditions from Angol and La Imperial drove the insurgents into the refuge of the Lumaco marshes. However, the news of the killing was spread by the Mapuches and it initiated a new general rising greater than the previous ones. With Villagra's arrival also came its first [[smallpox]] epidemic that ravaged the native population of Chile.\n\nThe toqui of the Arauco region, [[Millalelmo]], with a local army laid [[siege]] to Arauco from May 20 to June 30, 1562.<ref name=\"G\u00f3ngora\">{{cite book |title=Historia de Chile desde su descubrimiento hasta el a\u00f1o 1575 |last=G\u00f3ngora Marmolejo |first=Alonso de |authorlink=Alonso de G\u00f3ngora Marmolejo |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=XL |quote= |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/bameric/02582741011358306311291/p0000003.htm#I_41_}}</ref> At the end of 1562, the Mapuches under a leader named Meuco, had fortified a pucar\u00e1 in the province of Mareguano, three leagues from the city of Los Infantes.<ref name=\"Mari\u00f1oXVII\">{{cite book |title=Cr\u00f3nica del Reino de Chile |last=Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |first=Pedro |authorlink=Pedro Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=XVII |quote= |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/13582842323460728544424/p0000003.htm#I_81_}}</ref> Arias Pardo Maldonado destroyed the pucar\u00e1 but he did not gain a complete victory, since most of the Mapuches escaped. Elsewhere the corregidor of Ca\u00f1ete Juan Lazarte was killed at the gates of Ca\u00f1ete trying to recapture mounts stolen by thirty mapuches.\n\nThe Mapuches reconstructed the pucar\u00e1 near Los Infantes in January 1563, but Pedro de Villagra was sent again to destroy it. Once again the Mapuche rebuilt it, but this time with sections readily accessible to the cavalry, despite suspicions of veteran Spaniards they attacked the location, and many fell into well-disguised pits. There the governor's son, Pedro de Villagra \"el Mozo\" and forty two other Spaniards died. This disastrous military defeat forced governor Francisco de Villagra to order the city of Ca\u00f1ete to be abandoned. News of the abandonment of Ca\u00f1ete spread the revolt.\n\nWhen Francisco de Villagra heard the news of his son's death he became ill and left for Concepcion leaving his cousin, Pedro de Villagra, in charge of the campaign. The Mapuches, now under [[Colocolo (tribal chief)|Colocolo]] attacked on two fronts against the forts of Los Infantes and Arauco [[Investment (military)|investing]] them but were unable to take them. Again Peteg\u00fcelen offered peace to the Spaniards and Villagra accepted, but this peace was deceptive since the Mapuches needed to harvest their fields.\n\nIn April 1563, the Mapuche reestablished the siege of Arauco. This lasted 42 days with the Mapuches losing 500 warriors mostly from [[dysentery]] contracted from drinking contaminated water. Finally they chose to retire and to raise the siege. Shortly afterward, Francisco de Villagra died in Concepcion on June 22, 1563, leaving his cousin Pedro de Villagra as interim governor.\n\n=== Campaigns of Pedro de Villagra ===\nBecause he believed he had too few men to hold all the posts in Mapuche territory and still have a field army the new governor Pedro de Villagra ordered the abandonment of Arauco in July 1563, taking off its artillery and noncombatants by sea while garrison under [[Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado]] marched over the rain soaked mountains and flooded rivers to Angol. The Mapuche destroyed the fort shortly after the garrison left and harassed their march. Regarding the abandonment of Arauco as a victory, it inspired the Mapuche north of the Bio-bio River to revolt.\n\nIn 1564, Pedro de Villagra, took measures to protect all the towns and forts he still held and gathered a field army in Concepcion drawn from all these posts. He knew that one of the Mapuche objectives was to surround Concepcion and preparations were made to support a long [[siege]]. After a brief fight [[Loble]] defeated the troops of captain [[Francisco de Vaca]] in the Itata River valley who were coming with reinforcements from Santiago. In addition, [[Millalelmo]] ambushed Spanish reinforcements coming from Angol to the south under captain, [[Juan Perez de Zurita]], at a crossing of the [[Andali\u00e9n River]].<ref>Marmolejo, Historia..., Cap\u00edtulo XLV, located just two leagues south of the city. Lobera, '''Cr\u00f3nica...,''' Libro segundo, Parte segunda, Cap\u00edtulo XXIII, calls the place ''Levocatal''.</ref> Both defeats cut off the city and garrison of Concepcion from outside aid by land. The defeated survivors had to retreat to Santiago and were in no condition to break through the [[Investment (military)|investment]] around Concepcion. On the other hand, encouraged by these victories in the north, Illanguli\u00e9n resolved to destroy [[Angol|Los Infantes]] before marching to Concepcion.\n\nAt Los Infantes the Mapuche blockade grew tighter as they moved closer and closer to the city protected in their well-sited pucaras. Its commander Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado judged them too well defended to attack until they started to build their third pucara close to the city. Then in the [[Battle of Angol]] Lorenzo Bernal drove the Mapuche army out of their pucara and pursued them down to the river and pushed them back into it killing Illanguli\u00e9n and a thousand of his men with many others wounded or captured and the rest of the army dispersed. Afterward [[Paillataru]] was elected as Toqui.\n\nMeanwhile, the caciques Millalelmu and Loble with 20,000 warriors from the area between the Itata and Bio-Bio rivers, settled down to the [[Siege of Concepcion]] in February 1564. The Mapuche entered the city, sacking and burning it, crowding all its population within the walls of its fortress with its garrison under Pedro de Villagra. The siege lasted around two months until at the end of March two ships arrived and brought food that would permit the siege to continue for a much longer time. On the other side the Mapuche had used up local sources of food and were finding it difficult to maintain their large force. With the harvest season coming and with the news of their defeat in the Battle of Angol, they were nervous that their families might starve or their undefended homes might be attacked from Angol or Santiago. They raised their siege on April 1, and dispersed to their homes for the winter.<ref>[[Diego Barros Arana]], '''Historia General De Chile''', Tomo Segundo, Parte Tercera La Colonia desde 1561 hasta 1610, Capitulo Segundo Sec. 4</ref>\n\nAfter the siege was raised Villagra became aware of an effort to replace him as governor by Martin Ruiz de Gamboa, son-in-law of Rodrigo de Quiroga. Villagra tried to arrest Gamboa who fled overland to Santiago but Villagra sailed to [[Valpara\u00edso]] in a few days with some of his men and arrested him in Santiago when he arrived. Villagra then tried to reorganize the surviving disheartened troops of Vaca and Zurita in Santiago and take them south in October 1564. But he was delayed much longer, spending heavily from the impoverished provincial treasury and contributions exacted from the cities of Chile with difficulty, he slowly refitted and enlarged his army over the winter and spring.\n\nVillagra left the city in mid-January 1565, with 110 Spaniards and gathered 800 Indian auxiliaries from their [[repartimientos]] as he marched south to the Maule River. There he linked up with 30 Spaniards under [[Pedro Hernandez de Cordova]] who were observing the frontier with the Mapuche after the Mapuche had blocked their prior attempt to reinforce Concepcion. During the seven months Villagra was in Santiago, the Mapuche north of the Bio-Bio had built a strong pucara on the [[Perquilauqu\u00e9n River]], blocking the road south to Concepcion and in the [[Second Battle of Reinohuel\u00e9n]] Villagra rapidly took it and destroyed the Mapuche army holding it. Soon afterward Villagra ambushed Loble as he was bringing reinforcements and unaware of the defeat he was surprised defeated and captured. Subsequently, Villagra established fort ''[[Chill\u00e1n Viejo|San Ildefonso]]'' in the region and was able to suppress the Mapuche revolt north of the Bio-Bio.\n\n=== War during the rule of the Real Audiencia of Chile ===\nShortly after the end of the campaign Pedro de Villagra was replaced at the order of the [[Lope Garc\u00eda de Castro|Viceroy of Peru]] by [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]] as the temporary governor in 1565. Quiroga launched a new campaign, organized by [[Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado]] who reconstructed [[Ca\u00f1ete, Chile|Ca\u00f1ete]], and repopulated [[Arauco, Chile|Arauco]] in 1566. He accomplished the conquest of the island of [[Chilo\u00e9 Island|Chilo\u00e9]], sending [[Mart\u00edn Ruiz de Gamboa]] to establish the city of [[Castro, Chile|Castro]] there, and pacify its inhabitants, the [[Cuncos]]. Quiroga returned to find he was to be replaced by the [[Royal Audiencia of Concepci\u00f3n|Real Audiencia of Concepcion]] in August 1567. In September 1567, the king named [[Melchor Bravo de Saravia|Melchor Bravo de Saravia y Sotomayor]] to take over the civil and military government of Chile, with the title of governor and he arrived from [[Lima]] in 1568.\n\n== Campaigns between 1568 and 1598 ==\nDespite having founded cities and forts in Mapuche territory, all further Spanish conquest attempts failed. The [[Captaincy General of Chile]] became a problematic region of continual warfare where it became increasingly difficult to get soldiers to serve. The Spaniards would possibly have abandoned it if they not feared its colonization by another European nation. Several Spanish generals and nobles were assigned posts in Chile in an attempt to finish the war with the Mapuche.\n\n=== Campaigns during the governorship of Melchor Bravo de Saravia ===\nGovernor [[Melchor Bravo de Saravia|Melchor Bravo de Saravia y Sotomayor]] arrived from Lima in 1568 and recruited 100 new soldiers and gathered food in Santiago province and marched south to join the army near the mouth of the [[Tavolevo River]] in [[Catirai]].\n\nToqui [[Llanganabal]]\n\n[[Battle of Catirai]]\n\n[[1570 Concepci\u00f3n earthquake]]\n\n[[Pailacar]]\n\n[[Battle of Pur\u00e9n]]\n\nToqui [[Paine\u00f1amcu]] or Alonso Diaz\n\n=== Campaigns of Rodrigo de Quiroga and Mart\u00edn Ruiz de Gamboa ===\nGovernor [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]]\n\n[[1575 Valdivia earthquake]]\n\n[[Juan de Leb\u00fa]]\n\nGovernor [[Mart\u00edn Ruiz de Gamboa]]\n\n[[Tasa de Gamboa]]\n\n=== Campaigns of Alonso de Sotomayor ===\nGovernor [[Alonso de Sotomayor]] arrived in Chile in 1583 and had to judge accusations against his predecessor, who had become extremely unpopular for the Tasa de Gamboa which had prohibited the payment of taxes by the Indians in the form of labor. Sotomayor later absolved Gamboa entirely but abolished the Tasa de Gamboa and reinstituted the [[Tasa de Santill\u00e1n]], with new provisions to humanize the old system, in an attempt to avoid the excesses of the encomenderos against the Indians.\n\nDespite his early successful campaign when he captured Alonso Diaz in 1584, he wanted to extend the conquest of Chile by building a series of forts which would protect each other, the cities and their surrounding lands. They were also to hem in the Moluche and become the secure bases of future campaigns. In 1584, Sotomayor founded the fort of [[San Fabi\u00e1n de Conueo]] in [[Coelemu]] securing communications between Santiago and Concepcion. In 1585 he ordered the construction of forts around [[Catirai]], [[Santo Arbol de la Cruz]] where the [[Guaqui River]] enters the Bio Bio River, [[Esp\u00edritu Santo (fort)|Esp\u00edritu Santo]] near the mouth of the [[Tavolevo River]] with [[Sant\u00edsima Trinidad (fort)|Sant\u00edsima Trinidad]] directly across the Bio Bio River and in the upper reaches of the [[Culenco River]], fort [[San Jer\u00f3nimo de Millapoa]]. In [[Pur\u00e9n]] he also raised another fort, where he placed a small garrison.\n\nOpposing these moves by Sotomayor was the Toqui [[Cayancaru]] who attempted a siege of the fort at Arauco that failed, leading to his abdication of his office in favor of his son [[Nangoniel]] in 1585. Nangoniel returned to invest Arauco again, his cavalry (operating with the army for the first time) prevented the Spaniards from supplying the fort and they were forced to evacuate it. He next moved against the Sant\u00edsima Trinidad but clashed with a division of Spanish troops, under Francisco Hernandez, where he was wounded and soon hunted down and killed. [[Cadeguala]] was proclaimed Toqui in his place the same day and began operations against Angol, breaking into the city, however he was repulsed by a counterattack. He followed this with a siege of Pur\u00e9n the following year. He drove off a relief force with his cavalry and offered the garrison terms but was refused. He next challenged the commander of the fort, [[Alonso Garc\u00eda de Ram\u00f3n]], to single combat to decide the fate of the fortress. The two leaders fought on horseback with lances, and Cadeguala fell, killed by his opponent. His army raised the siege but after electing [[Guanoalca]] as toqui returned to successfully drive the poorly supplied Spanish from Pur\u00e9n and burned it in 1586.\n\n[[Puta\u00e9n]]\n\n[[Janequeo (lonco)|Janequeo]]\n\n[[Fort Liv\u00e9n]]\n\nMeanwhile, Sotomayor had the distraction of an attack by [[England|English]] [[pirates]] under [[Thomas Cavendish]]. When they anchored in [[Quintero]] on April 9, 1587, he was defeated by the Spanish, losing 10 men and continued up the coast of [[South America]].\n\nSotomayor rebuilt Pur\u00e9n in 1589 and built a new fort on the heights of [[Marihue\u00f1u]]. Guanoalca directed his army against the new Spanish fort but finding it too strongly held, diverted his attacks against Esp\u00edritu Santo and the fort of Sant\u00edsima Trinidad on the opposite shore of the Bio Bio River.\n\nToqui [[Quintuguenu]]\n\nToqui [[Paillaeco]]\n\nToqui [[Paillamachu]]\n\nGovernor [[Pedro de Viscarra]]\n\n==Third Great Mapuche Rebellion (1598)==\n=== Campaigns of Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda O\u00f1ez de Loyola ===\nIn September 1592, [[Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda \u00d3\u00f1ez de Loyola]], famous for his capture of [[T\u00fapac Amaru]] was appointed as [[Captain General]] directly by Philip II, who thought him the most likely candidate to finish the Arauco War. Loyola insisted in penetrating Mapuche territory with an army of soldiers coming directly from Panama. He established fort [[Santa Cruz de O\u00f1ez]] on the [[Rele River]] near the confluence of the Bio-Bio and [[Laja River (Chile)|Laja River]]s in May 1594. The fort was elevated to the rank of city in 1595 giving it the name of [[Santa Cruz de Coya]]. Later, on 21 December 1598, O\u00f1ez de Loyola became the second governor of Chile to die in war with the Mapuches, surprised by [[Pelantaro]] in the [[Disaster of Curalaba]].\n\n=== Mapuche Uprising of 1598 ===\n{{Main|Destruction of Seven Cities}}\nThe Disaster of Curalaba became the beginning of a general uprising that resulted in a six-year struggle called the [[Destruction of the Seven Cities]] that eliminated all Spanish settlements south of the [[Bio-Bio River]] with the exception of those in [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago]]. The viceroy of Peru hastily appointed [[Francisco de Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez]] as replacement for the deceased Loyola. He was an experienced military man with great prudence but with little aptitude for the crisis that he was called upon to face. This governor discovered the terrible state of the colony and asked urgently for reinforcements. Meanwhile, he tried to support those places that were possible to defend. Nevertheless, things were soon out of his control despite everything done to stabilize the situation, and he sickened and asked for his relief.\n\nOver the next few years, the Mapuche were able to destroy or force the abandonment of many cities and minor settlements including all the seven Spanish cities in Mapuche territory south of the Bio Bio River: [[Santa Cruz de Coya]] (1599), [[Valdivia, Chile|Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca de Valdivia]] (1599), [[Angol|San Andr\u00e9s de Los Infantes]] (1599), [[La Imperial, Chile|La Imperial]] (1600), [[Villarrica, Chile|Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena de Villa Rica]] (1602), [[Osorno, Chile|San Mateo de Osorno]] (1603), and [[Arauco, Chile|San Felipe de Araucan]] (1604).\n\n== Mapuche Insurrection of 1655 ==\n  {{Main|Mapuche Insurrection of 1655}}\n\nThe [[Mapuche Insurrection of 1655|last major uprising]] came on February 14, 1655 when Mapuche forces under [[Clentaru]] rose up against the Spaniards and pushed back the forces of governor [[Francisco Antonio de Acu\u00f1a Cabrera y Bayona]].<ref name=\"Elliot1907\">{{cite book|author=George Francis Scott Elliot|title=Chile: Its History and Development, Natural Features, Products, Commerce and Present Conditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ab4-AAAAYAAJ|year=1907|publisher=C.

He continues to maintain his position in Scrapomatic, with the duo frequently opening for The Derek Trucks Band.\n\nMike Mattison's voice has been considered a \"perfect fit\" for The Derek Trucks Band.

He was influenced by [[jazz]], the [[Blues music|blues]], and [[Roots revival|roots music]].  Mattison began exploring songwriting and performing with a friend who had also been raised in Minneapolis, [[Paul Olsen (musician)|Paul Olsen]]. The pair met in 1993 at a [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] concert, and began playing [[R&B]] and [[Blues music|blues]]-based music together afterward.<ref name=\"the washingtonpost1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/07/AR2010010701376.html|title=Scrapomatic band fuses blues, pop into an eclectic sound on 'Sidewalk Caesars'|last=Suarez|first=Ernest|date=January 8, 2010|work=The Washington Post|publisher=Washington Post Company|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref> Mattison's acceptance and subsequent college education at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] brought him east, and he convinced Olsen to move with him.\n\nMattison graduated from Harvard with a degree in English and American literature. Mattison and Olsen continued playing and performing together, forming the duo they named Scrapomatic. In 2002, [[Craig Street]] and John Snyder, the two record producers that had business ties with [[blues rock]] musician [[Derek Trucks]] independently suggested Mattison as the person to fill the newly vacated position of lead vocalist for The Derek Trucks Band.<ref name=\"npr 2006 worldcafe1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5664073&refresh=true|title=The Derek Trucks Band in Concert|year=2010|work=The World Cafe Live: NPR|publisher=NPR (National Public Radio)|accessdate=August 24, 2010}}</ref> Trucks, who was in New York City on business, had begun looking at the information and photos supplied of Mattison, and having seen Mattison's photos and demos singing, was surprised to find he was in the same subway car. After Trucks recognized him and introduced himself, Mattison performed in several concerts following the unusual meeting with [[The Derek Trucks Band]], and shortly afterward, landed the position, where he has remained since his entry into the band. He continues to maintain his position in Scrapomatic, with the duo frequently opening for The Derek Trucks Band.\n\nMike Mattison's voice has been considered a \"perfect fit\" for The Derek Trucks Band. After listening to the band play the arrangement of \"[[I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free|I Wish I Knew]]\" in the style of [[Nina Simone]], an [[National Public Radio|NPR]] host mentioned a \"growly\" quality to Mattison's voice, which Trucks was able to closely duplicate on the [[slide guitar]]. The next song had a completely different sound altogether, a rendition of a song by [[Skip James]], where Mattison sang in a [[falsetto]].<ref name=\"NPR 6stringcreation 1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5300263|title=Six-String Creation: The Derek Trucks Band|date=March 25, 2006|work=NPR Music Studio Stations|publisher=npr 2010|accessdate=September 20, 2010}}</ref> His wide range appealed to Trucks, who was looking for a lead vocalist that was not the usual fare.

One of his compositions, \"Midnight in Harlem,\" appears on the DVD release of Eric Clapton's [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]] 2010.\n\nOn July 17, 2013, Mike Mattison launched a Kickstarter Project,<ref name=\"Kickstarter Project 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikemattison/untitled-not-so-secret-mike-mattison-solo-album|title=(Untitled, Not-So-Secret) Mike Mattison Solo Album|website=Kickstarter.com|accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref> called \"untitled-not-so-secret-mike-Mattison-solo-album\" which successfully raised its funding goal on August 17, 2013. The project will be used to finish recording, mixing and mastering of his new album, which was expected to arrive around October 2013.\n\nMike Mattison released his solo CD \"You Can't Fight Love\" on Landslide Records (LDCD-1042) with a street date of June 3, 2014. In addition to recording and touring with the Tedeschi Trucks Band and Scrapomatic, Mattison and Ernest Suarez have held seminars on a literary genre they call Poetic Song Verse at various universities since 2016.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===With Scrapomatic===\n* 2002 \u2013 ''Scrapomatic''\n* 2006 \u2013 ''Alligator Love Cry'' [[Alligator Records]]\n* 2008 \u2013 ''Sidewalk Caesars'' Landslide Records\n\n===With The Derek Trucks Band===\n* ''[[Live at Georgia Theatre]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Songlines (The Derek Trucks Band album)|Songlines]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Songlines Live]]'' (2006, DVD)\n* ''[[Already Free]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Roadsongs (The Derek Trucks Band album)|Roadsongs]]'' (2010)\n\n===With Tedeschi Trucks Band===\n* ''[[Revelator (Tedeschi Trucks Band album)|Revelator]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Everybody's Talkin' (Tedeschi Trucks Band album)|Everybody's Talkin']]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Made Up Mind]] (2013)\n* ''[[Let Me Get By]] (2016)\n* ''[[Live from the Fox Oakland]] (2017)\n* ''[[Signs (Tedeschi Trucks Band album)|Signs]] (2019) <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tedeschitrucksband.com/news/signs|title=TTB's Fourth Studio Album SIGNS Is Available Now|website=Tedeschitrucjband.com|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Solo===\n* ''You Can't Fight Love'' Landslide Records (2014)\n* Afterglow (Landslide Records, 2020)\n\n===Other contributions===\n* ''Soul Summit'' (2008) (Maysa, [[Susan Tedeschi]], and Mike Mattison)<ref name=\"SoulSummit1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-01-08/music/soul-summit/|title=Soul Summit; Here is the bland soul-karaoke record you did not request|last=Torres|first=Richard|date=August 1, 2008|newspaper=The Village Voice|pages=Pg.1|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Commons}}\n{{The Derek Trucks Band}}\n{{Tedeschi Trucks Band}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mattison, Mike}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Blues rock musicians]]\n[[Category:Grammy Award winners]]\n[[Category:African-American musicians]]\n[[Category:Contemporary blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Columbia Records artists]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Minneapolis]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American rock songwriters]]\n[[Category:American male songwriters]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Singers from Minnesota]]\n[[Category:The Derek Trucks Band members]]\n[[Category:Tedeschi Trucks Band members]]\n[[Category:1969 births]]\n", "name_user": "CaroG87", "label": "safe", "comment": "Italicization", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Mattison"}

After the war in 1948 they emigrated to [[Australia]] and set up in business in [[Melbourne]].\n\nGoldberg found the [[ANZ Bank]] a ready lender in those days. The bank had quite deliberately cultivated Melbourne's Jewish community, believing them to be hard working and good credit risks. So with finance Goldberg got started in the 1970s doing mergers and deals in the textile business.\n\nGoldberg floated his Linter Group on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] in March 1985, helped by a loose group of men known as the AFP boys (for their associations with the [[Australian Farming Property]] company). During the next two years Linter continually changed shape and variously owned or controlled many famous Australian brands like [[King Gee]], [[Speedo]]s, [[Stubbies (brand)|Stubbies]] and [[Pelaco]].\n\nThe stock market crash of 1987 hit the deal-making hard, but over the next few years in fact allowed Goldberg to take most of his empire private, funded by debt. His bankers were still quite happy on his 60th birthday in September 1989, but when rumours started doing the rounds later that year they appointed Lindsay Maxsted of KPMG to look over the books.\n\nWhat Maxsted found in early 1990 was an enormously complex web of inter-company relationships, and total liabilities of some $1700m, which was far more than anyone knew and which exceeded estimated assets by at least $425m. Maxsted thought Goldberg had probably been technically insolvent ever since the stock market crash of 1987. The assets in liquidation didn't realize their initial estimates and the shortfall blew out to $750m.\n\nThe lenders for years had concentrated on Linter's excellent brands instead of the company's debt servicing ability. The group was probably only ever making perhaps $60m or $70m before tax, and (even with asset price inflation helping) that could never support loans of $1700m at prevailing interest rates (of up to 20%). Credit rating services like [[Moody's]] had Linter at [[junk bond]] status as early as 1988, but even that hadn't mattered.\n\nGoldberg had made various personal guarantees for the group and was consequently bankrupted, but not before he'd fled to Europe, where he settled back in his native Poland in 1992. Poland had no extradition treaty with Australia at that time so warrants issued in Australia for his arrest could not be executed.

After the war in 1948 they emigrated to [[Australia]] and set up in business in [[Melbourne]].\n\nGoldberg found the [[ANZ Bank]] a ready lender in those days. The bank had quite deliberately cultivated Melbourne's Jewish community, believing them to be hard working and good credit risks. So with finance Goldberg got started in the 1970s doing mergers and deals in the textile business.\n\nGoldberg floated his Linter Group on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] in March 1985, helped by a loose group of men known as the AFP boys (for their associations with the [[Australian Farming Property]] company). During the next two years Linter continually changed shape and variously owned or controlled many famous Australian brands like [[King Gee]], [[Speedo]]s, [[Stubbies (brand)|Stubbies]] and [[Pelaco]].\n\nThe stock market crash of 1987 hit the deal-making hard, but over the next few years in fact allowed Goldberg to take most of his empire private, funded by debt. His bankers were still quite happy on his 60th birthday in September 1989, but when rumours started doing the rounds later that year they appointed Lindsay Maxsted of KPMG to look over the books.\n\nWhat Maxsted found in early 1990 was an enormously complex web of inter-company relationships, and total liabilities of some $1700m, which was far more than anyone knew and which exceeded estimated assets by at least $425m. Maxsted thought Goldberg had probably been technically insolvent ever since the stock market crash of 1987. The assets in liquidation didn't realize their initial estimates and the shortfall blew out to $750m.\n\nThe lenders for years had concentrated on Linter's excellent brands instead of the company's debt servicing ability. The group was probably only ever making perhaps $60m or $70m before tax, and (even with asset price inflation helping) that could never support loans of $1700m at prevailing interest rates (of up to 20%). Credit rating services like [[Moody's]] had Linter at [[junk bond]] status as early as 1988, but even that hadn't mattered.\n\nGoldberg had made various personal guarantees for the group and was consequently bankrupted, but not before he'd fled to Europe, where he settled back in his native Poland in 1992. Poland had no extradition treaty with Australia at that time so warrants issued in Australia for his arrest could not be executed.
