It would have been inhabited by [[mammoth]]s, rhinos, hippos, giant deer and bison, which were preyed upon by sabre-toothed cats, lions, wolves and hyenas. As well as an abundant supply of game and edible plants, the river gravels were rich in flint deposits, which early humans would have found an invaluable resource.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\nThe Happisburgh finds mark the first time that evidence of early humans from 1,000,000 years ago has been found so far north. Palaeontologists had believed that hominins of the period required a much warmer climate, but the inhabitants of prehistoric Happisburgh had adapted to the cold, suggesting that they had developed advanced methods of hunting, clothing, sheltering and warming much earlier than previously thought.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\n==Archaeological context==\nHappisburgh has produced a number of significant archaeological finds over many years. As the shoreline is subject to severe [[coastal erosion]], new material is constantly being exposed along the cliffs and on the beach. Prehistoric discoveries have been noted since 1820, when fishermen trawling oyster beds offshore found their nets had brought up teeth, bones, horns, and antlers from elephants, rhinos, giant deer, and other extinct species. An exceptionally high tide in February 1825 exposed more prehistoric remains when it swept away sediment that had buried an ancient landscape of fossilized tree stumps, animal bones, and fir cones. In January 1877, a great storm swept huge [[ironstone]] slabs from the sea bed onto Happisburgh beach. The slabs preserved the impressions of leaves from oaks, elms, beeches, birches, and willows that had lived thousands of years ago. Pleistocene bison bones, found in the 1870s, provided the first evidence of early human activity; a re-examination of the bones in 1999 found that they were scored with tell-tale cut marks, indicating that the animals had been butchered by humans with stone tools.<ref name=\"CA288\"/>\n[[File:Happisburgh handaxe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Paleolithic handaxe, from Happisburgh, found on the beach by a man walking his dog in 2000]]\nIn 2000, a black flint handaxe, dating to between 600,000 and 800,000 years ago, was found by a man walking on the beach. In 2012, for the television documentary ''[[Britain's Secret Treasures]]'', the handaxe was selected by a panel of experts from the British Museum and the [[Council for British Archaeology]] as the most important item on a list of fifty archaeological discoveries made by members of the public.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Britain's Secret Treasures Episode Six | url=http://finds.org.uk/secrettreasures/episodesix | publisher=Portable Antiquities Scheme | accessdate=8 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title=NMS-ECAA52 | date=12 July 2012 | url=http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/512140 | publisher=[[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] | accessdate=10 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nSince the axe's discovery, the palaeolithic history of Happisburgh has been the subject of the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain (AHOB) and Pathways to Ancient Britain (PAB) projects, directed by Nick Ashton and [[Chris Stringer]], funded by grants from the [[Leverhulme Trust]] and Calleva Foundation. Between 2005 and 2010, eighty palaeolithic flint tools, mostly cores, flakes, and flake tools, were excavated from the foreshore in sediment dating back to up to 950,000 years ago.

Dating the site has instead been based upon [[stratigraphy]], [[palaeomagnetism]], and the evidence of fossil flora and fauna in the sediments.\n\nMagnetic signatures within the sedimentary deposits indicate they were laid down between the two most recent geomagnetic reversals \u2013 the [[Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal]] around 780,000 years ago and the [[Jaramillo reversal]] around 950,000 to 1 million years ago.\n\nThe evidence of fossil flora and fauna using indicators such as the fossilized teeth of [[vole]]s, which provide very accurate dating evidence, pushes the lower limit back to at least 840,000 years ago.\n\nOn this basis, the range of possible dates for the deposition of the sediments that the footprints were found in stretches from 850,000 to 950,000 years ago, but further research is necessary to narrow the window.<ref name=\"CA288\" /><ref name=\"independent-2014-02-08\"/><ref>{{Cite web | title=Dating the site | url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/all_current_projects/featured_project_happisburgh/dating_the_site.aspx | publisher=British Museum | accessdate=8 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Pleistocene geography==\nAt the time the Happisburgh hominins lived, a land bridge existed between Britain and France before the formation of the [[English Channel]] about 450,000 years ago.

It would have been inhabited by [[mammoth]]s, rhinos, hippos, giant deer and bison, which were preyed upon by sabre-toothed cats, lions, wolves and hyenas. As well as an abundant supply of game and edible plants, the river gravels were rich in flint deposits, which early humans would have found an invaluable resource.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\nThe Happisburgh finds mark the first time that evidence of early humans from 1,000,000 years ago has been found so far north. Palaeontologists had believed that hominins of the period required a much warmer climate, but the inhabitants of prehistoric Happisburgh had adapted to the cold, suggesting that they had developed advanced methods of hunting, clothing, sheltering and warming much earlier than previously thought.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\n==Archaeological context==\nHappisburgh has produced a number of significant archaeological finds over many years. As the shoreline is subject to severe [[coastal erosion]], new material is constantly being exposed along the cliffs and on the beach. Prehistoric discoveries have been noted since 1820, when fishermen trawling oyster beds offshore found their nets had brought up teeth, bones, horns, and antlers from elephants, rhinos, giant deer, and other extinct species. An exceptionally high tide in February 1825 exposed more prehistoric remains when it swept away sediment that had buried an ancient landscape of fossilized tree stumps, animal bones, and fir cones. In January 1877, a great storm swept huge [[ironstone]] slabs from the sea bed onto Happisburgh beach. The slabs preserved the impressions of leaves from oaks, elms, beeches, birches, and willows that had lived thousands of years ago. Pleistocene bison bones, found in the 1870s, provided the first evidence of early human activity; a re-examination of the bones in 1999 found that they were scored with tell-tale cut marks, indicating that the animals had been butchered by humans with stone tools.<ref name=\"CA288\"/>\n[[File:Happisburgh handaxe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Paleolithic handaxe, from Happisburgh, found on the beach by a man walking his dog in 2000]]\nIn 2000, a black flint handaxe, dating to between 600,000 and 800,000 years ago, was found by a man walking on the beach. In 2012, for the television documentary ''[[Britain's Secret Treasures]]'', the handaxe was selected by a panel of experts from the British Museum and the [[Council for British Archaeology]] as the most important item on a list of fifty archaeological discoveries made by members of the public.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Britain's Secret Treasures Episode Six | url=http://finds.org.uk/secrettreasures/episodesix | publisher=Portable Antiquities Scheme | accessdate=8 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title=NMS-ECAA52 | date=12 July 2012 | url=http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/512140 | publisher=[[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] | accessdate=10 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nSince the axe's discovery, the palaeolithic history of Happisburgh has been the subject of the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain (AHOB) and Pathways to Ancient Britain (PAB) projects, directed by Nick Ashton and [[Chris Stringer]], funded by grants from the [[Leverhulme Trust]] and Calleva Foundation. Between 2005 and 2010, eighty palaeolithic flint tools, mostly cores, flakes, and flake tools, were excavated from the foreshore in sediment dating back to up to 950,000 years ago.

In 2004, he co-founded BlueLithium, which went on to become the fifth largest ad-network in USA, before being sold to Yahoo in a $300 million deal. Chahal has since founded other internet-based companies including [[RadiumOne]] and Gravity4. He is currently the CEO of RedLotus. \n\nIn 2010, [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] named him among the 15 best young entrepreneurs of the year. In 2012,  Chahal was enlisted among the 25 richest entrepreneurs under the age of 30 by [[Complex (magazine)|Complex magazine]]. In 2013, he was named as one of the [[Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award|entrepreneurs of the year]] by [[Ernst and Young]].\n\nIn 2013, Chahal was convicted for [[domestic violence]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]], and was sentenced to [[probation]]. He claimed innocence, but was terminated from his role as CEO of RadiumOne by the Board of Directors. In 2016, after new charges of domestic violence against a second woman with whom he was in a relationship, his probation was revoked.

Three regions of Latvia meet in the vicinity of Tukums \u2013 [[Vidzeme]], [[Zemgale]] and [[Courland]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe historical center of Tukums developed between trade routes leading from the mouth of the [[Daugava River]] to [[Prussia]]. The oldest part is today's Talsi Street that originated at the river named Zvirgzdupite where there used to be a castle mound with a wooden castle. Since 1253 Tukums was ruled by the [[Livonian Order]]. A masonry castle was built on the bank of the [[Slocene]] river in the end of the 13th century. The castle was surrounded by settlements of [[Germans|German]] tradesmen and craftsmen. A marketplace was formed in front of the castle and some new streets appeared later running in various directions from the market place.\n\nWith the development of trade in the 16th century a new straighter trade route to Prussia was built along a new street that is called Liela (large) Street today. This street had an important role in the life of the settlement. Public buildings, major business, workshops and shops were concentrated in it.\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Livonian Order a new state, the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] was established. Like many other settlements Tukums had suffered greatly the numerous feudal wars. Under the rule of [[Jacob Kettler|Duke Jacob]] (1642\u20131682) Tukums experienced a rapid economic boom. At the time a new trade route from Tukums to [[Jelgava]], the capital of Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, was opened along today's Jelgavas Street, and another route was made along today's Raudas Street towards it. A dam was built and a lake made near the road to Jelgava. A flour mill and a cooper furnace started functioning there, and cooper was exported to foreign countries. The town, inhabited by only 800 people was quite small. The new adornment of Tukums was the lake. The church spire was another landmark added to the skyline in 1687.\n\nAfter 1795 Courland was incorporated into the  [[Russian Empire]]. In November of the same year the [[Catherine II of Russia|Russian Tsaritsa Katherine]] signed a document to divide Courland into regions and to grant regional center rights to several urban settlements, Tukums being one of them.\n\nThe town borders were marked in 1800 and the first urban map was made only two years later. The town continued growing. It included 131 private houses, mostly wooden, and 6 pubs. There were 690 male and 832 female inhabitants. The first school was opened in 1806. Street pavement was introduced in 1860 and street lighting started in 1875. A more rapid development of the town was observed after the opening of the Riga-Tukums railway line in 1877 and of another line connecting Tukums with [[Ventspils]] a little later. 24 enterprises were functioning in Tukums in 1897: tanneries, wood carding-mills, a glue plant and also pottery and food production facilities. The two windmills brought out the uniqueness of the townscape.\n\nThe town grew with the development of industry. Two new districts appeared. The rich built their houses in the eastern part around Elizabetes, Pils and Baznicas Streets, but the workers settled more to the west, forming an area of small houses surrounded by gardens. This part of Tukums was further developed during the year in 1935. In the beginning of the 1930s there were 8000 inhabitants and 73 functioning industrial enterprises in Tukums.\n\n== Places near Tukums ==\n\nThe [[Engure parish]] by the city was host to the [[Soviet Navy]] [[Tukums air base]]. It was converted into a civilian airport.\n\n[[Jaunpils Castle]] is the only fortified castle of the [[Order of Livonia]] that remains in Latvia. It was built in 1301. An exhibition hall and museum are located there on the history of the district. Jaunpils Lutheran Church which was built in 1592 is located near the castle.\n\n[[Jaunmoka Castle|Jaunmoku Palace]] (1901), {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} from Tukums, surrounded by the Courlands hills, hosts an exhibition on forestry. Jaunmoku Palace is a combination of [[Art Nouveau]] elements and [[Neo-Gothic]] forms and was built as the country residence of [[George Armitstead, 1st Baron Armitstead|George Armitstead]], mayor of Riga (1901\u201312).\n\n[[Durbe Manor|Durbe manor house]], ({{lang-lv|Durbes pils}}) rebuilt in 1820, is a classical style palace, surrounded by a landscaped park. A stone bridge across the ravine and a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] are located near the manor house.\n\nThe Schlokenbeck estate ensemble in Milzkalne, dating from the 15th century, is the only fortified [[manor house]] in Latvia. A museum on the history of broad building techniques and an exposition of horse gear is set up there.\n\nIn Zante region there is the highest peak of Tukums district \u2013 Smiltinkalns (153m), in the center of Zante there is a Red Army tank, evidence of the battles in \"[[Courland Pocket]]\" in 1944\u20131945.\n\nThe country of Zentene and Seme has the northern landscape of Courland \u2013 hills, curved roads, objects of nature and places of culture history.\n\nThe seashore of Tukums district has a length of {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}, where old fishermen's huts alternate with modern villas, and sandy beaches interchange with rocky shores and meadows.\n\n[[Kandava]] was the capital of the ancient Couronian state of Vanema. In the beginning of the 13th century, German knights built their castle there, though not much has been preserved from that time. In the Middle Ages, Kandava underwent numerous wars, fires and plague epidemics. \n\nThe Kandava hills are covered with dense forests and the [[Abava Rapids]] of the [[Abava River]]. Kandava marks the beginning of the run of the [[Abava Valley]], which is often locally referred to as \"Switzerland of Courland\" in as early as the 19th century.

{{lang-de|Tuckum}}; {{lang-liv|Tuk\u0101m\u014d}}) is a [[town]] in [[Latvia]]. Three regions of Latvia meet in the vicinity of Tukums \u2013 [[Vidzeme]], [[Zemgale]] and [[Courland]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe historical center of Tukums developed between trade routes leading from the mouth of the [[Daugava River]] to [[Prussia]]. The oldest part is today's Talsi Street that originated at the river named Zvirgzdupite where there used to be a castle mound with a wooden castle. Since 1253 Tukums was ruled by the [[Livonian Order]]. A masonry castle was built on the bank of the [[Slocene]] river in the end of the 13th century. The castle was surrounded by settlements of [[Germans|German]] tradesmen and craftsmen. A marketplace was formed in front of the castle and some new streets appeared later running in various directions from the market place.\n\nWith the development of trade in the 16th century a new straighter trade route to Prussia was built along a new street that is called Liela (large) Street today. This street had an important role in the life of the settlement. Public buildings, major business, workshops and shops were concentrated in it.\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Livonian Order a new state, the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] was established. Like many other settlements Tukums had suffered greatly the numerous feudal wars. Under the rule of [[Jacob Kettler|Duke Jacob]] (1642\u20131682) Tukums experienced a rapid economic boom. At the time a new trade route from Tukums to [[Jelgava]], the capital of Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, was opened along today's Jelgavas Street, and another route was made along today's Raudas Street towards it. A dam was built and a lake made near the road to Jelgava. A flour mill and a cooper furnace started functioning there, and cooper was exported to foreign countries. The town, inhabited by only 800 people was quite small. The new adornment of Tukums was the lake. The church spire was another landmark added to the skyline in 1687.\n\nAfter 1795 Courland was incorporated into the  [[Russian Empire]]. In November of the same year the [[Catherine II of Russia|Russian Tsaritsa Katherine]] signed a document to divide Courland into regions and to grant regional center rights to several urban settlements, Tukums being one of them.\n\nThe town borders were marked in 1800 and the first urban map was made only two years later. The town continued growing. It included 131 private houses, mostly wooden, and 6 pubs. There were 690 male and 832 female inhabitants. The first school was opened in 1806. Street pavement was introduced in 1860 and street lighting started in 1875. A more rapid development of the town was observed after the opening of the Riga-Tukums railway line in 1877 and of another line connecting Tukums with [[Ventspils]] a little later. 24 enterprises were functioning in Tukums in 1897: tanneries, wood carding-mills, a glue plant and also pottery and food production facilities. The two windmills brought out the uniqueness of the townscape.\n\nThe town grew with the development of industry. Two new districts appeared. The rich built their houses in the eastern part around Elizabetes, Pils and Baznicas Streets, but the workers settled more to the west, forming an area of small houses surrounded by gardens. This part of Tukums was further developed during the year in 1935. In the beginning of the 1930s there were 8000 inhabitants and 73 functioning industrial enterprises in Tukums.\n\n== Places near Tukums ==\n\nThe [[Engure parish]] by the city was host to the [[Soviet Navy]] [[Tukums air base]].

An exhibition hall and museum are located there on the history of the district. Jaunpils Lutheran Church which was built in 1592 is located near the castle.\n\n[[Jaunmoka Castle|Jaunmoku Palace]] (1901), {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} from Tukums, surrounded by the Courlands hills, hosts an exhibition on forestry.
