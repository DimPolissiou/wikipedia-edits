{"title_page": "Children's Crusade", "text_new": "{{short description|Attempted crusade by European Christians to expel Muslims from the Holy Land}}\n{{About|the purported events of 1212}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n[[File:Gustave dor\u00e9 crusades the childrens crusade.jpg|thumb|''The Children's Crusade'', by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]]]\nThe '''Children's Crusade''' was a failed [[Popular crusades|popular crusade]] by European [[Christians]] to regain the [[Holy Land]] from the [[Muslim]]s, said to have taken place in 1212. The crusaders left areas of [[Northern France]], led by Stephen of Cloyes, and Germany, led by Nicholas. The traditional narrative is likely conflated from some factual and mythical events which include the visions by a French boy and a German boy, an intention to peacefully convert Muslims in the Holy Land to Christianity, bands of children marching to [[Italy]], and children being sold into [[slavery]]. Many children were tricked by merchants and sailed over to what they thought were the holy lands but, in reality, were slave markets.\n\n==Accounts==\n===Traditional accounts===\n\nThe variants of the long-standing the story of the Children's Crusade have similar themes.<ref name=\"russel\"/> A boy begins to preach in either France or Germany; claims that he had been visited by Jesus, who instructed him to lead a [[Crusade]] in order to peacefully convert Muslims to Christianity. Through a series of portents and miracles, he gains a following of up to 30,000 children. He leads his followers south towards the [[Mediterranean Sea]], in the belief that the sea would part on their arrival, which would allow him and his followers to walk to [[Jerusalem]]. This does not happen. The children are sold to two merchants (Hugh the Iron and William of Posqueres), who give free passage on boats to as many of the children as are willing. The pilgrims are then either taken to [[Tunisia]], where they are sold into slavery by the merchants or else die in a [[shipwreck]] on [[San Pietro Island]] off [[Sardinia]] during a [[gale]].\n\n===Modern accounts===\nAccording to more recent researchers, there seem to have actually been two movements of people (of all ages) in 1212 in Germany and France.<ref name=\"raedts\"/><ref name=\"russel\"/> The similarities of the two allowed later chroniclers to combine and embellish the tales.\n\n====Nicholas of Cologne in Germany====\nIn the first movement, Nicholas, an eloquent shepherd from the                b [[Rhineland]] in Germany,<ref name=\"bridge1980\">Bridge, Antony. ''The Crusades''. London: Granada Publishing, 1980. {{ISBN|0-531-09872-9}}</ref> tried to lead a group across the [[Alps]] and into Italy in the early spring of 1212. Nicholas said that the sea would dry up before them and allow his followers to cross into the Holy Land. Rather than intending to fight the [[Saracens]], he said that the Muslim kingdoms would be defeated when their citizens converted to Catholicism.<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/> His disciples went off to preach the call for the \"Crusade\" across the German lands, and they massed in [[Cologne]] after a few weeks. Splitting into two groups, the crowds took different roads through Switzerland. Two out of every three people on the journey died, while many others returned to their homes.<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/> About 7,000 arrived in [[Genoa]] in late August. They immediately marched to the harbor, expecting the sea to divide before them; when it did not many became bitterly disappointed. A few accused Nicholas of betraying them, while others settled down to wait for God to change his mind, since they believed that it was unthinkable he would not eventually do so. The Genovese authorities were impressed by the little band, and they offered citizenship to those who wished to settle in their city. Most of the would-be Crusaders took up this opportunity.<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/> Nicholas refused to say he was defeated and traveled to [[Pisa]], his movement continuing to break up along the way. He and a few loyal followers continued to the [[Papal States]], where they met [[Pope Innocent III]]. The remaining ones departed for Germany after the [[Pontiff]] exhorted them to be good and to return home to their families. Nicholas did not survive the second attempt across the Alps; back home his father was arrested and hanged under pressure from angry families whose relatives had perished while following the child.<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/>\n\nSome of the most dedicated members of this Crusade were later reported to have wandered to [[Ancona]] and [[Brindisi]]; none is known to have reached the Holy Land.<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/>\n\n====Stephen of Cloyes in France====\nThe second movement was led by a twelve-year-old<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/> French shepherd boy named Stephen of [[Cloyes-sur-le-Loir|Cloyes]], who said in June that he bore a letter for the king of France from Jesus. Large gangs of youth around his age were drawn to him, most of whom claimed to possess special gifts of God and thought themselves miracle workers. Attracting a following of over 30,000 adults and children, he went to [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], where he was reported to cause miracles. On the orders of [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], advised by the [[University of Paris]], the people were implored to return home. Philip himself did not appear impressed, especially since his unexpected visitors were led by a mere child, and refused to take them seriously. Stephen, however, was not dissuaded and began preaching at a nearby abbey. From Saint-Denis, Stephen traveled around France, spreading his messages as he went, promising to lead charges of Christ to Jerusalem. Although the Church was skeptical, many adults were impressed by his teaching.<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/> A few of those who initially joined him possessed his activeness; it is estimated that there were less than half the initial 30,000 remaining, a figure that was shrinking rapidly, rather than growing as perhaps anticipated.\n\nAt the end of June 1212, Stephen led his largely juvenile Crusaders from [[Vend\u00f4me]] to [[Marseilles]]. They survived by begging for food, while the vast majority seem to have been disheartened by the hardship of this journey and returned to their families.<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/>\n\n==Historiography==\n{{Crusade}}\n\n===Sources===\nAccording to Peter Raedts, professor in Medieval History at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], there are only about 50&nbsp;sources from the period that talk about the crusade, ranging from a few sentences to half a page.<ref name=\"raedts\"/> Raedts categorizes the sources into three types depending on when they were written:<ref name=\"raedts\"/>\n#Contemporary sources written by 1220;\n#Sources written between 1220 and 1250 (the authors could have been alive at the time of the crusade but wrote their memories down later);\n#Sources written after 1250 by authors who received their information second or third hand.\n\nRaedts does not consider the sources after 1250 to be authoritative, and of those before 1250, he considers only about 20 to be authoritative. It is only in the later non-authoritative narratives that a \"children's crusade\" is implied by such authors as [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Thomas of Cantimpr\u00e9]], [[Matthew Paris]] and many others.\n\n===Historical studies===\nPrior to Raedts's study of 1977, there had only been a few historical publications researching the Children's Crusade. The earliest were by the Frenchman G. de Janssens (1891) and the German [[Reinhold R\u00f6hricht]] (1876). They analyzed the sources but did not analyze the story. American medievalist [[Dana Carleton Munro]] (1913\u201314), according to Raedts, provided the best analysis of the sources to date and was the first to significantly provide a convincingly sober account of the Crusade stripped of legends.<ref>Munro, D. C. (1913\u201314). \"The Children's Crusade\". ''American Historical Review''. 19:516\u201324.</ref> Later, J. E. Hansbery (1938\u20139) published a correction of Munro's work, but it has since been discredited as based on an unreliable source.<ref name=\"raedts\"/> German psychiatrist [[Justus Hecker]] (1865) did give an original interpretation of the crusade, but it was a polemic about \"diseased religious emotionalism\" that has since been discredited.<ref name=\"raedts\"/>\n\nP. Alphandery (1916) first published his ideas about the crusade in 1916 in an article which was later published in book form in 1959. He considered the story of the crusade to be an expression of the medieval cult of the Innocents, as a sort of sacrificial rite in which the Innocents gave themselves up for the good of [[Christendom]]; however, he based his ideas on some of the most untrustworthy sources.<ref>Alphandery, P. (1954). ''La Chr\u00e9tient\u00e9 et l'id\u00e9e de croisade''. 2 vols.</ref>\n\nAdolf Waas (1956) saw the Children's Crusade as a manifestation of chivalric piety and as a protest against the glorification of the holy war.<ref>Waas, A. (1956). ''Geschichte der Kreuzz\u00fcge''</ref> H. E. Mayer (1960) further developed Alphandery's ideas of the Innocents, saying children were the chosen people of God because they were the poorest; recognizing the cult of poverty, he said that \"the Children's Crusade marked both the triumph and the failure of the idea of poverty.\"<ref>Mayer, H.E. (1972). ''The Crusades''</ref> Giovanni Miccoli (1961) was the first to note that the contemporary sources did not portray the participants as children. It was this recognition that undermined all other interpretations,<ref>Miccoli, G. (1961). \"La crociata dei fancifulli\". ''Studi medievali''. Third Series, 2:407\u201343</ref> except perhaps that of [[Norman Cohn]] (1971) who saw it as a [[chiliastic]] movement in which the poor tried to escape the misery of their everyday lives.<ref>Cohn, N. (1971). ''The pursuit of the millennium''. London.</ref> In his book \"Children's Crusade: Medieval History, Modern Mythistory\" <ref> Gary Dickson, \"Children's Crusade\" (2007) </ref> Gary Dickson discusses the growing number of \"impossiblist\" movements across Western Europe at the time.

The crusaders left areas of [[Northern France]], led by Stephen of Cloyes, and Germany, led by Nicholas. The traditional narrative is likely conflated from some factual and mythical events which include the visions by a French boy and a German boy, an intention to peacefully convert Muslims in the Holy Land to Christianity, bands of children marching to [[Italy]], and children being sold into [[slavery]]. Many children were tricked by merchants and sailed over to what they thought were the holy lands but, in reality, were slave markets.\n\n==Accounts==\n===Traditional accounts===\n\nThe variants of the long-standing story of the Children's Crusade have similar themes.<ref name=\"russel\"/> A boy begins to preach in either France or Germany; claims that he had been visited by Jesus, who instructed him to lead a [[Crusade]] in order to peacefully convert Muslims to Christianity. Through a series of portents and miracles, he gains a following of up to 30,000 children. He leads his followers south towards the [[Mediterranean Sea]], in the belief that the sea would part on their arrival, which would allow him and his followers to walk to [[Jerusalem]]. This does not happen. The children are sold to two merchants (Hugh the Iron and William of Posqueres), who give free passage on boats to as many of the children as are willing. The pilgrims are then either taken to [[Tunisia]], where they are sold into slavery by the merchants or else die in a [[shipwreck]] on [[San Pietro Island]] off [[Sardinia]] during a [[gale]].\n\n===Modern accounts===\nAccording to more recent researchers, there seem to have actually been two movements of people (of all ages) in 1212 in Germany and France.<ref name=\"raedts\"/><ref name=\"russel\"/> The similarities of the two allowed later chroniclers to combine and embellish the tales.\n\n====Nicholas of Cologne in Germany====\nIn the first movement, Nicholas, an eloquent shepherd from the [[Rhineland]] in Germany,<ref name=\"bridge1980\">Bridge, Antony. ''The Crusades''. London: Granada Publishing, 1980. {{ISBN|0-531-09872-9}}</ref> tried to lead a group across the [[Alps]] and into Italy in the early spring of 1212. Nicholas said that the sea would dry up before them and allow his followers to cross into the Holy Land. Rather than intending to fight the [[Saracens]], he said that the Muslim kingdoms would be defeated when their citizens converted to Catholicism.<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/> His disciples went off to preach the call for the \"Crusade\" across the German lands, and they massed in [[Cologne]] after a few weeks. Splitting into two groups, the crowds took different roads through Switzerland. Two out of every three people on the journey died, while many others returned to their homes.<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/> About 7,000 arrived in [[Genoa]] in late August. They immediately marched to the harbor, expecting the sea to divide before them; when it did not many became bitterly disappointed. A few accused Nicholas of betraying them, while others settled down to wait for God to change his mind, since they believed that it was unthinkable he would not eventually do so. The Genovese authorities were impressed by the little band, and they offered citizenship to those who wished to settle in their city. Most of the would-be Crusaders took up this opportunity.<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/> Nicholas refused to say he was defeated and traveled to [[Pisa]], his movement continuing to break up along the way. He and a few loyal followers continued to the [[Papal States]], where they met [[Pope Innocent III]]. The remaining ones departed for Germany after the [[Pontiff]] exhorted them to be good and to return home to their families. Nicholas did not survive the second attempt across the Alps; back home his father was arrested and hanged under pressure from angry families whose relatives had perished while following the child.<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/>\n\nSome of the most dedicated members of this Crusade were later reported to have wandered to [[Ancona]] and [[Brindisi]]; none is known to have reached the Holy Land.<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/>\n\n====Stephen of Cloyes in France====\nThe second movement was led by a twelve-year-old<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/> French shepherd boy named Stephen of [[Cloyes-sur-le-Loir|Cloyes]], who said in June that he bore a letter for the king of France from Jesus. Large gangs of youth around his age were drawn to him, most of whom claimed to possess special gifts of God and thought themselves miracle workers. Attracting a following of over 30,000 adults and children, he went to [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], where he was reported to cause miracles. On the orders of [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], advised by the [[University of Paris]], the people were implored to return home. Philip himself did not appear impressed, especially since his unexpected visitors were led by a mere child, and refused to take them seriously. Stephen, however, was not dissuaded and began preaching at a nearby abbey. From Saint-Denis, Stephen traveled around France, spreading his messages as he went, promising to lead charges of Christ to Jerusalem. Although the Church was skeptical, many adults were impressed by his teaching.<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/> A few of those who initially joined him possessed his activeness; it is estimated that there were less than half the initial 30,000 remaining, a figure that was shrinking rapidly, rather than growing as perhaps anticipated.\n\nAt the end of June 1212, Stephen led his largely juvenile Crusaders from [[Vend\u00f4me]] to [[Marseilles]]. They survived by begging for food, while the vast majority seem to have been disheartened by the hardship of this journey and returned to their families.<ref name=\"bridge1980\"/>\n\n==Historiography==\n{{Crusade}}\n\n===Sources===\nAccording to Peter Raedts, professor in Medieval History at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], there are only about 50&nbsp;sources from the period that talk about the crusade, ranging from a few sentences to half a page.<ref name=\"raedts\"/> Raedts categorizes the sources into three types depending on when they were written:<ref name=\"raedts\"/>\n#Contemporary sources written by 1220;\n#Sources written between 1220 and 1250 (the authors could have been alive at the time of the crusade but wrote their memories down later);\n#Sources written after 1250 by authors who received their information second or third hand.\n\nRaedts does not consider the sources after 1250 to be authoritative, and of those before 1250, he considers only about 20 to be authoritative. It is only in the later non-authoritative narratives that a \"children's crusade\" is implied by such authors as [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Thomas of Cantimpr\u00e9]], [[Matthew Paris]] and many others.\n\n===Historical studies===\nPrior to Raedts's study of 1977, there had only been a few historical publications researching the Children's Crusade. The earliest were by the Frenchman G. de Janssens (1891) and the German [[Reinhold R\u00f6hricht]] (1876). They analyzed the sources but did not analyze the story. American medievalist [[Dana Carleton Munro]] (1913\u201314), according to Raedts, provided the best analysis of the sources to date and was the first to significantly provide a convincingly sober account of the Crusade stripped of legends.<ref>Munro, D. C. (1913\u201314). \"The Children's Crusade\". ''American Historical Review''. 19:516\u201324.</ref> Later, J. E. Hansbery (1938\u20139) published a correction of Munro's work, but it has since been discredited as based on an unreliable source.<ref name=\"raedts\"/> German psychiatrist [[Justus Hecker]] (1865) did give an original interpretation of the crusade, but it was a polemic about \"diseased religious emotionalism\" that has since been discredited.<ref name=\"raedts\"/>\n\nP. Alphandery (1916) first published his ideas about the crusade in 1916 in an article which was later published in book form in 1959. He considered the story of the crusade to be an expression of the medieval cult of the Innocents, as a sort of sacrificial rite in which the Innocents gave themselves up for the good of [[Christendom]]; however, he based his ideas on some of the most untrustworthy sources.<ref>Alphandery, P. (1954). ''La Chr\u00e9tient\u00e9 et l'id\u00e9e de croisade''. 2 vols.</ref>\n\nAdolf Waas (1956) saw the Children's Crusade as a manifestation of chivalric piety and as a protest against the glorification of the holy war.<ref>Waas, A. (1956). ''Geschichte der Kreuzz\u00fcge''</ref> H. E. Mayer (1960) further developed Alphandery's ideas of the Innocents, saying children were the chosen people of God because they were the poorest; recognizing the cult of poverty, he said that \"the Children's Crusade marked both the triumph and the failure of the idea of poverty.\"<ref>Mayer, H.E. (1972). ''The Crusades''</ref> Giovanni Miccoli (1961) was the first to note that the contemporary sources did not portray the participants as children. It was this recognition that undermined all other interpretations,<ref>Miccoli, G. (1961). \"La crociata dei fancifulli\". ''Studi medievali''. Third Series, 2:407\u201343</ref> except perhaps that of [[Norman Cohn]] (1971) who saw it as a [[chiliastic]] movement in which the poor tried to escape the misery of their everyday lives.<ref>Cohn, N. (1971). ''The pursuit of the millennium''.

Infamous for their shunning of any form of wealth and refusing to join a monastery, they would travel in groups and rely upon small donations or meals from those who listened to their sermons to survive. Excommunicated by the Pope, they were forced to wander and likely made up a large portion of what is called the \"Children's Crusade\". Peter Raedts's analysis of 1977 is considered the best source to date to cover the many issues surrounding the Children's Crusade.<ref name=\"russel\"/>\n\nHistorians have put the crusade in the context of the role of teenage boys in medieval warfare.<ref>Kelly DeVries, \"Teenagers at War During the Middle Ages\" in ''The Premodern Teenager: Youth in Society, 1150-1650'' (2002) ed by Konrad Eisenbichler pp 207-223.</ref> Literary scholars have explored its role in the evolution of the tale of the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]].<ref>Bernard Queenan, \"The Evolution of the Pied Piper,\" ''Children's Literature'' (1978) 7#1 pp: 104-114.</ref>\n\n===Popular accounts===\nBeyond the scientific studies there are many popular versions and theories about the Children's Crusades.

[http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/children.html \"The Children's Crusade\"], from ''A History of the Crusades''.</ref> Raedts notes that \"Although he cites Munro's article in his notes, his narrative is so wild that even the unsophisticated reader might wonder if he had really understood it.\" [[Donald Spoto]], in a book about Saint [[Francis of Assisi]], said monks were motivated to call them children, and not wandering poor, because being poor was considered pious and the Church was embarrassed by its wealth in contrast to the poor.

The [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]] selected [[Big Sky Airlines]] to provide service beginning July 1, 2006, but that order was suspended when Great Lakes decided to continue service without the EAS subsidy.\n\nIn 2007 Mesaba Airlines (Northwest Airlink) [[Saab 340]]s flew direct to Minneapolis/Saint Paul via Watertown, and Great Lakes flew Beechcraft 1900s nonstop to Denver as an independent airline.<ref>Feb. 2007 OAG Flight Guide</ref> After the merger of Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines in 2010, Delta Connection Saab 340s flew Minneapolis to Pierre. When Delta quit using the Saab 340 in December 2011, and announced it was leaving Pierre, flights from Minneapolis used Delta's Canadair Regional Jet 200 until Delta pulled out on January 31, 2012.\n\nMore recently Great Lakes Airlines 19-seat (later 9-seat) Beechcraft 1900Ds to Minneapolis/St. Paul and Denver have been the only airline flights at Pierre.

It has two asphalt runways: 7/25 is 6,881 by 150 feet (2,097 x 46 m) and 13/31 is 6,900 by 100 feet (2,103 x 30 m).<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nIn 2010 the airport had 32,140 aircraft operations, average 88 per day: 78% [[general aviation]], 11% airline, 11% [[air taxi]] and <1% military. 98 aircraft were then based at the airport: 71% single-engine, 28% multi-engine and 1% [[helicopter]].<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\n==New terminal building==\n[[File:Pierre Regional Airport terminal model.JPG|thumb|250px|The current airport terminal building opened on September 12, 2012, a 21,000 square foot facility built by Dean Kurtz Construction]]\n\nA new terminal had been needed for many years, as the old terminal building was plagued by a number of problems, primarily space constraints. Construction on the new terminal began in late Spring, 2011 and completed in September, 2012.<ref>[http://ci.pierre.sd.us/Department.aspx?id=2 Pierre Regional Airport web page]</ref>\nDenver-based Coover-Clark & Associates, Inc. designed the building and Kadrmas Lee & Jackson's Rapid City office handled the construction administration.<ref>[http://www.fciol.com/documents/Pierre_Airport/pierre_air_General.pdf Pierre Regional Airport -- 100% construction documents.]</ref> Initially, a [[jet bridge]] was to be installed at the terminal, but airport officials decided to wait until a scheduled commercial airline could use the [[jet bridge]], as [[Great Lakes Airlines]] aircraft serving the airport at the time were not [[jet bridge]] capable. Officials also waited because Pierre had been without scheduled passenger jet service operated with mainline aircraft for over 30 years. The new terminal building was designed with the space set aside for a loading bridge, so it required very little effort to install one when the time came.\n\nWith the introduction of jet service by Aerodynamics, Inc. in 2016, the city began considering a jet bridge for the airport. In August 2017, the Pierre city commission awarded the job of making and installing a new jet-boarding bridge to Sharpe of Pierre for its bid of $716,500. The new jet bridge was installed at the airport on April 23, 2018. A federal grant covered nearly all the costs, with the state kicking in 5% and the city 5%, or about $45,000.\n\n==Airline and destinations==\n\nAir service to Pierre resumed on April 3, 2019, with daily flights to [[Denver International Airport|Denver]] and continuation service to [[Watertown Regional Airport|Watertown]]. Service is provided by [[SkyWest Airlines]], operating via the [[United Express]] brand on behalf of [[United Airlines]] using a 50-seat [[Canadair Regional Jet 200]]. This service is subsidized with annual funding of $3.64 million (or $49.84 per seat) from the [[Essential_Air_Service|Essential Air Service]] program, currently scheduled to end April 30, 2021.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.transportation.gov/office-policy/aviation-policy/essential-air-service-reports | publisher = U.S. Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n{{Airport destination list\n| [[United Express]] | [[Denver International Airport|Denver]]\n}}\n\n=== Map of destinations ===\n{| class=\"collapsible\" style=\"border:2px #aaa solid; width:500px; margin:0.2em auto;\"\n|-\n!

Inland Airlines and successor [[Western Airlines]] served the present airport from about 1938 until 1984; in the 1950s Pierre was one of six stops on a Minneapolis-Los Angeles [[Convair 240]] flight.<ref>http://timetableimages.com, April 29, 1951 Western timetable</ref><ref>http://timetableimages.com, Sept. 24, 1960 & Aug. 1, 1966 & Aug. 1, 1968 Western timetables</ref>\n\n[[North Central Airlines]] [[Douglas DC-3]]s arrived in 1959, flying Minneapolis/Saint Paul - Watertown, SD - Aberdeen, SD - Pierre - Rapid City - Spearfish, SD.<ref>http://www.timetableimages.com, July 1, 1960 North Central timetable</ref> [[Convair 340]]s, [[Convair 440]]s and [[Convair 580]]s followed.<ref>http://www.timetableimages.com, Oct. 29, 1967 North Central timetable</ref>\n\nThe first jets were North Central [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]]s in 1968.

Great Lakes [[Beechcraft 1900]]s flew nonstop to Denver and direct to Minneapolis/Saint Paul, and Mesaba [[Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner]] flew nonstop to Minneapolis/Saint Paul, and AirVantage Metroliners flew nonstop to Bismarck, ND, Rapid City and Sioux Falls.<ref>Sept. 15, 1994 Official Airline Guide</ref>\nIn summer 1999 Great Lakes Airlines (United Express) Beech 1900s flew to Denver and other cities.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, June 1, 1999 Official Airline Guide</ref>  Great Lakes lost its designation as a United Express carrier but continues to serve Pierre.\n\nUntil June 30, 2006 [[Great Lakes Airlines]] flights to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] were subsidized by the [[Essential Air Service]] (EAS) program. The [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]] selected [[Big Sky Airlines]] to provide service beginning July 1, 2006, but that order was suspended when Great Lakes decided to continue service without the EAS subsidy.\n\nIn 2007 Mesaba Airlines (Northwest Airlink) [[Saab 340]]s flew direct to Minneapolis/Saint Paul via Watertown, and Great Lakes flew Beechcraft 1900s nonstop to Denver as an independent airline.<ref>Feb. 2007 OAG Flight Guide</ref> After the merger of Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines in 2010, Delta Connection Saab 340s flew Minneapolis to Pierre. When Delta quit using the Saab 340 in December 2011, and announced it was leaving Pierre, flights from Minneapolis used Delta's Canadair Regional Jet 200 until Delta pulled out on January 31, 2012.\n\nMore recently Great Lakes Airlines 19-seat (later 9-seat) Beechcraft 1900Ds to Minneapolis/St. Paul and Denver have been the only airline flights at Pierre. Great Lakes Airlines flew via [[interlining|interline]] agreements with [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Frontier Airlines]] and [[United Airlines]].\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:Pierre Regional Airport.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Old terminal building, demolished September 2013]]\n\nPierre Regional Airport covers 1,834 [[acre]]s (742 [[hectare|ha]]) at an elevation of 1,744 feet (532 m). It has two asphalt runways: 7/25 is 6,881 by 150 feet (2,097 x 46 m) and 13/31 is 6,900 by 100 feet (2,103 x 30 m).<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nIn 2010 the airport had 32,140 aircraft operations, average 88 per day: 78% [[general aviation]], 11% airline, 11% [[air taxi]] and <1% military. 98 aircraft were then based at the airport: 71% single-engine, 28% multi-engine and 1% [[helicopter]].<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\n==New terminal building==\n[[File:Pierre Regional Airport terminal model.JPG|thumb|250px|The current airport terminal building opened on September 12, 2012, a 21,000 square foot facility built by Dean Kurtz Construction]]\n\nA new terminal had been needed for many years, as the old terminal building was plagued by a number of problems, primarily space constraints. Construction on the new terminal began in late Spring, 2011 and completed in September, 2012.<ref>[http://ci.pierre.sd.us/Department.aspx?id=2 Pierre Regional Airport web page]</ref>\nDenver-based Coover-Clark & Associates, Inc. designed the building and Kadrmas Lee & Jackson's Rapid City office handled the construction administration.<ref>[http://www.fciol.com/documents/Pierre_Airport/pierre_air_General.pdf Pierre Regional Airport -- 100% construction documents.]</ref> Initially, a [[jet bridge]] was to be installed at the terminal, but airport officials decided to wait until a scheduled commercial airline could use the [[jet bridge]], as [[Great Lakes Airlines]] aircraft serving the airport at the time were not [[jet bridge]] capable. Officials also waited because Pierre had been without scheduled passenger jet service operated with mainline aircraft for over 30 years. The new terminal building was designed with the space set aside for a loading bridge, so it required very little effort to install one when the time came.\n\nWith the introduction of jet service by Aerodynamics, Inc. in 2016, the city began considering a jet bridge for the airport. In August 2017, the Pierre city commission awarded the job of making and installing a new jet-boarding bridge to Sharpe of Pierre for its bid of $716,500. The new jet bridge was installed at the airport on April 23, 2018. A federal grant covered nearly all the costs, with the state kicking in 5% and the city 5%, or about $45,000.\n\n==Airline and destinations==\n\nAir service to Pierre resumed on April 3, 2019, with daily flights to [[Denver International Airport|Denver]] and continuation service to [[Watertown Regional Airport|Watertown]]. Service is provided by [[SkyWest Airlines]], operating via the [[United Express]] brand on behalf of [[United Airlines]] using a 50-seat [[Canadair Regional Jet 200]]. This service is subsidized with $3.64 million (or $49.84 per seat) from the [[Essential_Air_Service|Essential Air Service]] program, currently scheduled to end April 30, 2021.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.transportation.gov/office-policy/aviation-policy/essential-air-service-reports | publisher = U.S. Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n{{Airport destination list\n| [[United Express]] | [[Denver International Airport|Denver]]\n}}\n\n=== Map of destinations ===\n{| class=\"collapsible\" style=\"border:2px #aaa solid; width:500px; margin:0.2em auto;\"\n|-\n!

Whereas the first season was serious and subdued with tiny bursts of action and comedy, the second season was all flash and fun. To fit this motif, John Woo and Joe Carnahan were hired to direct ''Hostage'' and ''Ticker'', respectively.

As he complies, the federal agents break in and attempt to subdue the man, who shoots himself in the head without revealing where the woman is hidden. The Driver then tries to find the hostage before she drowns in the trunk of a sinking car. As a twist, the kidnapped woman is revealed to be the hostage taker's lover. She coldly taunts the dying man in the hospital.\n* Starring [[Maury Chaykin]] and [[Kathryn Morris]]\n* Directed by [[John Woo]]\n* Written by David Carter, [[Greg Hahn]] and Vincent Ngo\n* Featured the [[BMW Z4 (E85)|BMW Z4 3.0i]]\n\n====''Ticker''====\nIn an unnamed foreign country, the Driver drives a wounded man who carries a mysterious briefcase, while under helicopter attack. During the attack the briefcase is struck by a bullet, causing a display on it to begin counting down, and it to leak an unknown grey fluid from the bullet hole. The Driver manages to cause the helicopter to crash, but refuses to proceed without knowing the contents of the damaged briefcase. It is revealed that the man guards a human heart for transplant to a [[Politician|statesman]] (shown in military uniform), whose life and [[peacemaking]] is needed for the continued freedom of the country's people. The case is delivered by the Driver in time for the surgery. Also present are another military officer whom the passenger had said would take over the country with tyranny if his superior died (and whose uniform matches the soldiers who had tried to intercept the heart), and US agents who ensure that he does not interfere with the surgery, and so is forced to give up his attempt to take the country by force. \n* Starring [[Don Cheadle]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]]\n* cameos by [[Ray Liotta]], [[Robert Patrick]], [[Clifton Powell]] and [[Dennis Haysbert]] as US agents\n* Written and directed by [[Joe Carnahan]]\n* Featured the [[BMW Z4 (E85)|BMW Z4 3.0i]]\n\n====''Beat the Devil''====\nThe Driver is employed by [[James Brown]], who goes to meet the [[Devil]] to re-negotiate the deal he made as a young man in 1954 to [[deal with the Devil|trade his soul]] for fame and fortune. He is worried about his ageing and the fact he can no longer do his moves like [[the splits]], and says his lessened ability to perform means he cannot maintain his fame and fortune. He proposes a new wager, for the stakes of the Driver's soul against another 50 years for his career, betting on the Driver [[drag racing]] against the Devil's doorman/driver Bob on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] at dawn. The race ends with the Driver swerving to pass around a train while the Devil's car (a flamed [[Pontiac Firebird]]) crashes and explodes. Having won the race, the Driver leaves James Brown in the desert, but as he drives away he sees him as a young man again, who then does a [[Handspring (gymnastics)|handspring]] into the splits. The final scene shows [[Marilyn Manson]] who lives down the hall from the Devil, complaining that the noise is disturbing his [[Bible]] reading. \n* Starring [[James Brown]], [[Gary Oldman]], and [[Danny Trejo]]\n* cameo by [[Marilyn Manson]]\n* Directed by [[Tony Scott]]\n* Written by David Carter, Greg Hahn and Vincent Ngo\n* Featured the [[BMW Z4 (E85)|BMW Z4 3.0i]]\n\n===\"The Subplot Films\"===\nFour smaller movies, dubbed \"The Subplot Movies\" were shot and directed by [[Ben Younger]]. Lacking any real style (and appearing to be shot with a standard consumer-level DV-cam), they were designed to \"fill in the gaps\" between the five films and featured a man who appeared to be tracking the Driver, finding \"clues\" usually scribbled, in pen, on small pieces of paper. The films, at first glance, have no real connection to the Driver movies at all and made no real sense \u2013 they contained \"clues\" that were part of an [[alternate reality game]] that would lead intuitive fans to a party in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n===Season 3===\n\n====''The Escape''====\n{{main|The Escape (2016 film)}}\nAfter the disappearance of geneticist Dr. Nora Phillips and the exposure of the Molecular Genetics company's illegal activities in human cloning, the FBI raids the facility to arrest its key people. One surviving specimen, Lily, is escorted by a ruthless mercenary and gunman named Holt to be delivered to an unnamed customer, who bought the specimen. The Driver is hired to transport the package with Holt \"babysitting\" him, ordering the hired driver to evade the FBI forces. At the end, when the Driver realizes that Lily has human feelings, he forces Holt to get out of the car and drives the girl to a harbor where Dr. Phillips becomes the unnamed customer and takes proper care of her creation.\n* Starring [[Jon Bernthal]], [[Dakota Fanning]], and [[Vera Farmiga]]\n* Directed by [[Neill Blomkamp]]\n* Written by Neill Blomkamp and David Carter\n* Featured the [[BMW 5 Series (G30)]]\n\n==Contest/game & party==\nShortly after the release of the \"Subplot Films\", reports circulated around the Internet that Apple, Starbucks, BMW Films First Illinois Mortgage, and Susstones' all had a small, hidden link on their website that had a direct connection with the movies. Upon further investigation, three phone numbers and a web address were found in the four films, which led many viewers to call those numbers and go to that website.\n\nThousands took to the web, taking place in the hunt but only 250 solved the puzzle, which allowed the lucky few to be entered in a drawing to win a 2003 BMW Z4, seen in ''Hostage''.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle was a voicemail, instructing participants to meet with a correspondent in Las Vegas, the site of a VIP Party for BMW where the Grand Prize Z4 was given away to a couple from [[Bellingham, Washington]].<ref>[http://www.unfiction.com/compendium/2003/01/12/uncapping-the-ride-bmw-endgame-gives-hope/ compendium archive \u00bb Uncapping the Ride \u2013 BMW Endgame Gives Hope]. unfiction.com (January 12, 2003).

While they are leaving Jacobs tells the Driver about the horrors he saw as a photographer, but he regrets his inability to help war victims. Jacobs answers the Driver's curiosity about why he is a photographer by saying how his mother taught him to see. He gives the Driver the camera film needed for a ''[[New York Times]]'' story and also his [[dog tags]] to give to his mother. When they reach the border, they are confronted by a guard who begins to draw arms as Jacobs begins taking pictures, seemingly trying to get himself killed.

After he is told that he holds the life of a person in his hand, he is ordered to burn the money. As he complies, the federal agents break in and attempt to subdue the man, who shoots himself in the head without revealing where the woman is hidden.

During the attack the briefcase is struck by a bullet, causing a display on it to begin counting down, and it to leak an unknown grey fluid from the bullet hole. The Driver manages to cause the helicopter to crash, but refuses to proceed without knowing the contents of the damaged briefcase. It is revealed that the man guards a human heart for transplant to a [[Politician|statesman]] (shown in military uniform), whose life and [[peacemaking]] is needed for the continued freedom of the country's people. The case is delivered by the Driver in time for the surgery. Also present are another military officer whom the passenger had said would take over the country with tyranny if his superior died (and whose uniform matches the soldiers who had tried to intercept the heart), and US agents who ensure that he does not interfere with the surgery, and so is forced to give up his attempt to take the country by force. \n* Starring [[Don Cheadle]] and [[F.

He is worried about his ageing and the fact he can no longer do his moves like [[the splits]], and says his lessened ability to perform means he cannot maintain his fame and fortune. He proposes a new wager, for the stakes of the Driver's soul against another 50 years for his career, betting on the Driver [[drag racing]] against the Devil's doorman/driver Bob on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] at dawn. The race ends with the Driver swerving to pass around a train while the Devil's car (a flamed [[Pontiac Firebird]]) crashes and explodes. Having won the race, the Driver leaves James Brown in the desert, but as he drives away he sees him as a young man again, who then does a [[Handspring (gymnastics)|handspring]] into the splits. The final scene shows [[Marilyn Manson]] who lives down the hall from the Devil, complaining that the noise is disturbing his [[Bible]] reading. \n* Starring [[James Brown]], [[Gary Oldman]], and [[Danny Trejo]]\n* cameo by [[Marilyn Manson]]\n* Directed by [[Tony Scott]]\n* Written by David Carter, Greg Hahn and Vincent Ngo\n* Featured the [[BMW Z4 (E85)|BMW Z4 3.0i]]\n\n===\"The Subplot Films\"===\nFour smaller movies, dubbed \"The Subplot Movies\" were shot and directed by [[Ben Younger]]. Lacking any real style (and appearing to be shot with a standard consumer-level DV-cam), they were designed to \"fill in the gaps\" between the five films and featured a man who appeared to be tracking the Driver, finding \"clues\" usually scribbled, in pen, on small pieces of paper. The films, at first glance, have no real connection to the Driver movies at all and made no real sense \u2013 they contained \"clues\" that were part of an [[alternate reality game]] that would lead intuitive fans to a party in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n===Season 3===\n\n====''The Escape''====\n{{main|The Escape (2016 film)}}\nAfter the disappearance of geneticist Dr. Nora Phillips and the exposure of the Molecular Genetics company's illegal activities in human cloning, the FBI raids the facility to arrest its key people. One surviving specimen, Lily, is escorted by a ruthless mercenary and gunman named Holt to be delivered to an unnamed customer, who bought the specimen. The Driver is hired to transport the package with Holt \"babysitting\" him, ordering the hired driver to evade the FBI forces. At the end, when the Driver realizes that Lily has human feelings, he forces Holt to get out of the car and drives the girl to a harbor where Dr. Phillips becomes the unnamed customer and takes proper care of her creation.\n* Starring [[Jon Bernthal]], [[Dakota Fanning]], and [[Vera Farmiga]]\n* Directed by [[Neill Blomkamp]]\n* Written by Neill Blomkamp and David Carter\n* Featured the [[BMW 5 Series (G30)]]\n\n==Contest/game & party==\nShortly after the release of the \"Subplot Films\", reports circulated around the Internet that Apple, Starbucks, BMW Films First Illinois Mortgage, and Susstones' all had a small, hidden link on their website that had a direct connection with the movies. Upon further investigation, three phone numbers and a web address were found in the four films, which led many viewers to call those numbers and go to that website.\n\nThousands took to the web, taking place in the hunt but only 250 solved the puzzle, which allowed the lucky few to be entered in a drawing to win a 2003 BMW Z4, seen in ''Hostage''.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle was a voicemail, instructing participants to meet with a correspondent in Las Vegas, the site of a VIP Party for BMW where the Grand Prize Z4 was given away to a couple from [[Bellingham, Washington]].<ref>[http://www.unfiction.com/compendium/2003/01/12/uncapping-the-ride-bmw-endgame-gives-hope/ compendium archive \u00bb Uncapping the Ride \u2013 BMW Endgame Gives Hope]. unfiction.com (January 12, 2003).
