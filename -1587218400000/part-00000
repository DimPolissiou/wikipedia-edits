During this time, blue light is said to emit within Jesus Christ's tomb, rising from the marble slab covering the stone bed believed to be that upon which Jesus' body is believed to have been placed for burial. The marble slab is now in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem. The light is believed to form a column of fire, from which candles are lit.

When the church wardens were about to fill the lamps to make them ready to celebrate the resurrection of Christ, they suddenly noticed that there was no more oil left to pour in the lamps. Upon this, Bishop [[Narcissus of Jerusalem]] ordered the candles to be filled with water. He then told the wardens to ignite them.

The candles spontaneously ignited after approximately 20 minutes due to the self-ignition properties of white phosphorus when in contact with air. According to Kalopoulos' website:\n\n<blockquote>If phosphorus is dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent, self-ignition is delayed until the solvent has almost completely evaporated. Repeated experiments showed that the ignition can be delayed for half an hour or more, depending on the density of the solution and the solvent employed.</blockquote>\n\nKalopoulos also says that chemical reactions of this nature were well known in ancient times, quoting Strabo, who states: \"In Babylon there are two kinds of naphtha springs, a white and a black. The white naphtha is the one that ignites with fire.\" ([[Geographica (Strabo)|Strabon Geographica]] 16.1.15.1-24) He further states that phosphorus was used by [[Babylon|Chaldean]] magicians in the early fifth century BC, and by the ancient Greeks, in a way similar to its supposed use today by the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://forum.stirpes.net/orthodox-church/3270-michael-kalopoulos-miracle-holy-light-jerusalem.html#post37609 |title=The \"Holy\" Light of Jerusalem |access-date=24 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410130116/http://forum.stirpes.net/orthodox-church/3270-michael-kalopoulos-miracle-holy-light-jerusalem.html#post37609 |archive-date=10 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nRussian skeptic Igor Dobrokhotov<ref>{{cite web|url=http://razumru.ru/humanism/journal/49/dobrokhotov.htm |title=Igor Dobrokhotov |language=Russian}}</ref> has analysed the evidence for an alleged miracle at length on his website, including the ancient sources<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0418\u0421\u0422\u041e\u0420\u0418\u042f \u0411\u041b\u0410\u0413\u041e\u0414\u0410\u0422\u041d\u041e\u0413\u041e \u041e\u0413\u041d\u042f |language=Russian |url=http://neholyfire.narod.ru/book/kr4.htm}}</ref> and contemporary photos and videos.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u041e\u0411\u0421\u0423\u0416\u0414\u0415\u041d\u0418\u0415 \u0424\u041e\u0422\u041e\u0421\u0412\u0418\u0414\u0415\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c\u0421\u0422\u0412 |language=Russian |url=http://neholyfire.narod.ru/book/kr9.htm}}</ref> Dobrokhotov and other critics, including Russian Orthodox researcher Nikolay Uspensky,{{cn|date=February 2020}} Dr. Aleksandr Musin of Sorbonne, and some [[Old Believers]] quote excerpts from the diaries of Bishop [[Porphyrius (Uspensky)]] (1804\u20131885),<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0415\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f \u041f\u043e\u0440\u0444\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0439|url=http://palomnic.org/sz_sr/personalii/porfiri_uspenski/ |language=Russian}}</ref> which told that the clergy in Jerusalem knew that the Holy Fire was fraudulent.\n\nIn his book, the journalist Dimitris Alikakos presents an interview with the [[skeuophylax]] Archbishop Isidoros of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, in which the former admits that the \"Sleepless Candle\", which himself puts into the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] during the morning of the [[Holy Saturday]], is ignited by him with a lighter<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|75}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.antenna.gr/watch/1272797/ant1-news-20032019-stis-19-30|title=ANT1 NEWS 20-03-2019 \u03a3\u03a4\u0399\u03a3 19:30|website=antenna.gr|language=el|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iefimerida.gr/news/486287/salos-me-agio-fos-poio-thayma-anavo-me-anaptira-leei-skeyofylakas-toy-panagioy-tafoy|title=\u03a3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u0391\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf \u03a6\u03c9\u03c2 -\u00ab\u03a0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf \u03b8\u03b1\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1; \u03a4\u03bf \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03b2\u03c9 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1\u00bb \u03bb\u03ad\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03bf\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a4\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5 [\u03b2\u03af\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03bf] {{!}} \u0395\u039b\u039b\u0391\u0394\u0391|last=IEFIMERIDA.GR|first=NEWSROOM|date=2019-03-19|website=iefimerida.gr|language=el|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref>.

The white naphtha is the one that ignites with fire.\" ([[Geographica (Strabo)|Strabon Geographica]] 16.1.15.1-24) He further states that phosphorus was used by [[Babylon|Chaldean]] magicians in the early fifth century BC, and by the ancient Greeks, in a way similar to its supposed use today by the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://forum.stirpes.net/orthodox-church/3270-michael-kalopoulos-miracle-holy-light-jerusalem.html#post37609 |title=The \"Holy\" Light of Jerusalem |access-date=24 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410130116/http://forum.stirpes.net/orthodox-church/3270-michael-kalopoulos-miracle-holy-light-jerusalem.html#post37609 |archive-date=10 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nRussian skeptic Igor Dobrokhotov<ref>{{cite web|url=http://razumru.ru/humanism/journal/49/dobrokhotov.htm |title=Igor Dobrokhotov |language=Russian}}</ref> has analysed the evidence for an alleged miracle at length on his website, including the ancient sources<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0418\u0421\u0422\u041e\u0420\u0418\u042f \u0411\u041b\u0410\u0413\u041e\u0414\u0410\u0422\u041d\u041e\u0413\u041e \u041e\u0413\u041d\u042f |language=Russian |url=http://neholyfire.narod.ru/book/kr4.htm}}</ref> and contemporary photos and videos.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u041e\u0411\u0421\u0423\u0416\u0414\u0415\u041d\u0418\u0415 \u0424\u041e\u0422\u041e\u0421\u0412\u0418\u0414\u0415\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c\u0421\u0422\u0412 |language=Russian |url=http://neholyfire.narod.ru/book/kr9.htm}}</ref>\n\nDobrokhotov and other critics, including Russian Orthodox researcher Nikolay Uspensky,{{cn|date=February 2020}} Dr. Aleksandr Musin of Sorbonne, and some [[Old Believers]] quote excerpts from the diaries of Bishop [[Porphyrius (Uspensky)]] (1804\u20131885),<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0415\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f \u041f\u043e\u0440\u0444\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0439|url=http://palomnic.org/sz_sr/personalii/porfiri_uspenski/ |language=Russian}}</ref> which told that the clergy in Jerusalem knew that the Holy Fire was fraudulent.\n\nIn his book, the journalist Dimitris Alikakos presents an interview with the [[skeuophylax]] Archbishop Isidoros of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, in which the former admits that the \"Sleepless Candle\", which himself puts into the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] during the morning of the [[Holy Saturday]], is ignited by him with a lighter<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|75}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.antenna.gr/watch/1272797/ant1-news-20032019-stis-19-30|title=ANT1 NEWS 20-03-2019 \u03a3\u03a4\u0399\u03a3 19:30|website=antenna.gr|language=el|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iefimerida.gr/news/486287/salos-me-agio-fos-poio-thayma-anavo-me-anaptira-leei-skeyofylakas-toy-panagioy-tafoy|title=\u03a3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u0391\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf \u03a6\u03c9\u03c2 -\u00ab\u03a0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf \u03b8\u03b1\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1; \u03a4\u03bf \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03b2\u03c9 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1\u00bb \u03bb\u03ad\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03bf\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a4\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5 [\u03b2\u03af\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03bf] {{!}} \u0395\u039b\u039b\u0391\u0394\u0391|last=IEFIMERIDA.GR|first=NEWSROOM|date=2019-03-19|website=iefimerida.gr|language=el|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref>.

He was educated at [[Royal College, Colombo]] and [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] before returning to become a [[Plantation|planter]] and run the family estates and mines. Being from a politically active family, he entered active politics at the age of 35 years having been elected to the [[State Council of Ceylon]].

He remained in Europe for five years, spending most of that time in England and France, attended [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] to study agriculture. Kotelawala was known as an aggressive and outspoken man who loved sports, horseback riding and [[cricket]] and, particularly as a young man, got into physical fights when he was insulted. He was fluent in [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

However, to much of his anger, [[Herwald Ramsbotham, 1st Viscount Soulbury|Lord Soulbury]], the [[Governor-General of Ceylon|Governor-General]] appointed Senanayake's son and Kotelawala's younger cousin, [[Dudley Senanayake]] as Prime Minister on 26 March 1952. An angry Kotelawala threatened resignation and a possible split in the party appeared. After mediation between Kotelawala and Senanayake by senior UNP members including [[Oliver Ernest Goonetilleke|Sir Oliver Goonetilleke]], Kotelawala agreed to serve in Dudley Senanayake's cabinet retaining his existing portfolio. Soon after Senanayake called for fresh elections and in the [[1952 Ceylonese parliamentary election|1952 general elections]] Kotelawala was re-elected and retained his ministry and the post of leader of the house as the UNP won a majority to form a government.<ref name=\"ft1\"/>\n\nThe following year, the Senanayake government faced a major civil unrest with left-wing parties launching the [[Hartal 1953|1953 Hartal]] in August. On 12 August 1953 civil disobedience, strikes and demonstrations started through out the island by trade unions against the proposed elimination of the subsidy on rice by the government. The country came to standstill with transport and communication stopping due to acts of sabotage. The government implemented emergency regulations and deployed the army to suppress the Hartal and restore order. Badly shaken by the events of the Hartal, Senanayake gravely ill resigned as Prime Minister on 12 October 1953. Kotelawala succeeded Senanayake as Prime Minister; Minister of Defense and External Affairs; and leader of the UNP.<ref name=\"ft1\"/>\n\n==Prime minister==\n===Domestic policy===\nHis government partially retained the rice subsidy which led to the 1953 Hartal. An ardent anti-communist, he took a hardline stand against triad unions and left-wing parties. He formed the [[Ceylon Railway Engineer Corps]] and [[Post and Telegraph Signals]] to minimized the effects to transport and communication in the event of trade union action.\n\nHe hosted in Ceylon [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] during their Royal Commonwealth Tour in April 1954, using the occasion to request the appointment of a Ceylonese Governor-General when Lord Soulbury's tenor ended. This came to be when Sir Oliver Goonetilleke was appointed Governor-General in July 1954.

In 1955 he led his country's delegation to the [[Bandung Conference|Bandung conference]] in [[Indonesia]], where his performance earned him the epithet ''Bandung Booruwa'' (Bandung Donkey) in Sri Lanka. At the conference he stated his belief that fashionably Marxist anti-colonialist rhetoric ignored Communist atrocities. In a private conversation with the prime ministers of Pakistan, India, Burma, and China, he asked Chinese premier [[Zhou Enlai]] if he wanted to bring Communism to Tibet. Zhou replied that it was impractical and undesirable, and that the PRC had gone to Tibet because it was \"an integral part of the Chinese state\" and because it had been threatened by \"imperialist intrigues\" from the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jawaharlal Nehru: Letters to Chief Ministers 1957-1964|volume=4|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=159\u2013171|editor=Parthasarathy, Gopalapuram}}</ref>\n\n===Electoral defeat===\nHis government had to deal with economic problems and ethnic conflicts. Although his parliamentary term was valid till 1957, he had Parliament dissolved in 1956 calling for fresh elections. However the UNP faced a major defeat in the [[1956 Ceylonese parliamentary election|1956 general elections]] by a group of more radically chauvinistic [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] parties under the leadership of [[Solomon Bandaranaike]]. The UNP was only able to win eight seats in parliament.\n\n==Final years in Parliament==\nKotelawala retained his parliamentary seat having been reelected from the Dodangaslanda electorate, however he returned the party leadership to [[Dudley Senanayake]]. He did not contest the [[March 1960 Ceylonese parliamentary election|1960 general elections]], instead he supported the candidacy of [[A. U. Romanis]], his personal [[chauffeur]], as the UNP candidate for Dodangaslanda. Romanis won both general elections in 1960 and remained a member of parliament till 1964.\n\n==Later life==\nKotelawala retired from politics shortly after his electoral defeat. He bought the Brogues Wood estate at [[Biddenden]] in [[Kent]], where he lived for several years. He eventually returned to Ceylon. When the post of [[Governor-General of Ceylon|Governor-General]] appeared vacant with completion of [[William Gopallawa]]'s first term, he was hopeful that he would be nominated to the post by the United National Party which was in the government at the time. However [[Dudley Senanayake]] in his second term as Prime Minister did not name a successor for Gopallawa and allowed him to have a second term.\n\n===Defence university===\nKotelawala was a strong supporter of the military and maintained close links with the army. He was the first Chairman of the Ceylon Light Infantry Association in 1974 and was the President of the Ceylon Ex Servicemen's Association from 1948 to his death. In 1978, the commanders of the armed forces identified a need to establish a Defence university to cater to the academic training of its officers. Although the government approved it, funds were limited and no location was provided by the government. In 1979, [[Lieutenant General]] [[Denis Perera]], [[Commander of the Army (Sri Lanka)|Commander of the Sri Lankan Army]] approached Kotelawala with the proposal of donating his home [[Kandawala]] and its 50 acres estate to the state to establish a Defence university. Six months later in 1980, having reviewed the proposal and consulted his heirs, Kotelawala agreed to donate Kandawala following his death. Shortly after he signed a deed of gift with the President, transferring Kandawala and a formal ceremony to establish the institution was scheduled for 11 October 1980.<ref>[http://www.army.lk/detailed.php?NewsId=103 Commander Pays Tribute to Late Sir John Kotelawala ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411014907/http://www.army.lk/detailed.php?NewsId=103 |date=11 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn 29 September 1980 he suffered a stroke at Kandawala and was taken to the cardiac unit of the [[Colombo General Hospital]]. On 1 October, President [[Junius Jayewardene|J. R.

On 5 October, Kotelawala's coffin which was kept at Kandawala was moved to [[Old Parliament Building, Colombo|Parliament House]] to lay in state, before final rites at [[Independence Square, Colombo|Independence Square]] with full military honours.<ref name=\"SO1\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nHe married Effie Manthri Dias Bandaranaike daughter of F. H. Dias Bandaranaike and Maria Frances Dias Bandaranaike ''nee'' Senanayake. Effie Bandaranaike was the niece of [[Don Stephen Senanayake]]. Although the marriage was not successful, ending in divorce, it produced a daughter Lakshmi Kotelawala who married Henry Gerald Kotalawala.<ref>[http://www.sundaytimes.lk/140209/sunday-times-2/how-kotelawala-snr-got-young-brother-in-law-killed-84856.html How Kotelawala (Snr) got young brother-in-law killed ]</ref>\n\nKotelawala was known for his flamboyance and the company he kept. He would entertain guests at his home at Kandawala and his cottage in Nuware eliya. Even as Prime Minister he resided at Kotelawala.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1985 a national defence academy for training of officers for all three Sri Lankan defence services was established at his estate [[Kandawala]], which he had left to the country in his will for this purpose. It has been named '''[[General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University]]''' (KDU) is a defence university offering undergraduate and post graduate study courses to officers of the defence services in Sri Lanka in various disciplines. Statues of Sir John Kotelawala have been erected in many parts of the island, including one at the [[Old Parliament Building, Colombo]]. Many schools, libraries and public buildings have been named in his honor. In 1993, the Sir John Kotelawala Museum was opened at Kandawala by the President.\n\n==Titles and honours==\n[[File:Sir john kotelawala Coat of Arms.png|frame|right|120px|Sir John Kotelawala's Coat of Arms]]\n[[File:Don Harry Kotelawala's Service Letter from Sir John Kotelawala.jpg|thumb|An Official Letter to [[Harry Kotelawala]]]]\nHis Orders, Decorations and Medals and other memorabilia are on display at the [[General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University]].\n\n;Appointments\n*{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} Member of the [[Privy Council]] (1954)\n\n;Decorations and Medals\n*{{flagicon|Ceylon}} [[Order of the Companions of Honour]] (1956)\n*{{flagicon|Ceylon}} Knight of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (Civil Division) (1948)\n*{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[King George V Silver Jubilee Medal]] (1935)\n*{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[King George VI Coronation Medal]] (1937)\n*{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[Defence Medal (United Kingdom)|Defence Medal]] (1946)\n*{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[War Medal 1939\u20131945]] (1946)\n*{{flagicon|Ceylon}} [[Efficiency Medal]] (Ceylon) (1949)\n*{{flagicon|Ceylon}} [[Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal]] (1953)\n*{{flagicon|Ceylon}} [[Ceylon Armed Services Long Service Medal]] (1956)\n*{{flagicon|Ceylon}} [[Ceylon Armed Services Inauguration Medal]] (1968)\n*{{flagicon|Sri Lanka|army}} [[Republic of Sri Lanka Armed Services Medal]] (1972)\n*{{flagicon|Sri Lanka|army}} Sri Lanka Army 25th Anniversary Medal (1974)\n\n;Foreign honours\n*{{flagicon|France}} Grand Cross of the [[L\u00e9gion d\u00b4honneur]] (1954){{efn|There are no record in the official French Database [[Base L\u00e9onore|L\u00e9onore]].<ref>http://www.culture.gouv.fr/documentation/leonore/recherche.htm</ref>}}\n*{{flagicon|Italy}} Grand Cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]] (1954)<ref>http://www.quirinale.it/elementi/DettaglioOnorificenze.aspx?decorato=32188</ref>\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} Grand Cross 1st Class of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] (1955)\n*{{flagicon|Thailand}} Grand Cross of the [[Order of the White Elephant]] (1956)\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]]\n*{{flagicon|Japan}} [[Order of the Rising Sun]], 1st Class (1954)\n*{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} Knights of Justice of the [[Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem|Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem]] (1965)\n<ref>[http://www.noolaham.net/project/118/11711/11711.pdf \"Ceylon Today,\" December 1954]</ref>\n\n;Educational\n*{{flagicon|Ceylon}} [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] (honorary) &ndash; [[University of Ceylon]]\n*{{flagicon|Sri Lanka}} [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] (posthumously) &ndash; [[General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University]]\n\n;Honorary military appointments\n*{{flagicon|Sri Lanka|army}} [[General (Sri Lanka)|General]] of the [[Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force|Volunteer Force of the Army]] (1980)\n*{{flagicon|United Kingdom|army}} [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] of the [[Ceylon Light Infantry]] (1942)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kotelawala cabinet]]\n*[[List of political families in Sri Lanka]]\n*[[General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University]]\n*[[Ceylon Light Infantry]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lkawgw/gen3003.htm  The Kotelawala Ancestry]\n*[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lkawgw/gen3119.htm   Attygalle Family Tree]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080325034304/http://www.parliament.lk/handbook_of_parliament/prime_ministers.jsp Website of the Parliament of Sri Lanka]\n*[http://www.kdu.ac.lk/ Official Website of General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080418182701/http://www.unp.lk/portal/ Official Website of United National Party]\n*[http://www.uklankatimes.net/Insidepages/OpenFile/OpenFile.aspx?SID=3  PLAYING THE GAME WITH - SIR JOHN]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lkawgw/sirjohn.html Sir John Kotelawala's early years]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140728031859/http://www.rivira.lk/2009/02/01/rivinetha2.htm  Amara Samara in Sinhala]\n*[http://www.divaina.com/2008/06/23/mano04.html  Sir John Kotelawala in Sinhala]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081006163349/http://www.lankadeepa.lk/Section/diyatha/15062008/09.htm  Sir John Kotelawala in Sinhala]\n*[http://www.divaina.com/2008/10/20/mano03.html   Sir John Kotelawala in Sinhala]\n*[http://ceylonmedals.com/sir_john_bio.htm General The Rt.Hon.

Being from a politically active family, he entered active politics at the age of 35 years having been elected to the [[State Council of Ceylon]].

He formed the [[Ceylon Railway Engineer Corps]] and [[Post and Telegraph Signals]] to minimized the effects to transport and communication in the event of trade union action.\n\nHe hosted in Ceylon [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] during their Royal Commonwealth Tour in April 1954, using the occasion to request the appointment of a Ceylonese Governor-General when Lord Soulbury's tenor ended. This came to be when Sir Oliver Goonetilleke was appointed Governor-General in July 1954. Kotelawala himself was appointed to the [[Privy Council]] during the visit.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Premier van ceylon op bezoek in ons land, Bestanddeelnr 091-0363.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sir John Kotelawala meeting Dutch Prime Minister Willem Drees at [[The Hague]] in 1955.]]\nAs prime minister, Kotelawala led Sri Lanka into the [[United Nations]] and contributed to Sri Lanka's expanding foreign relations, particularly with other Asian countries. In 1955 he led his country's delegation to the [[Bandung Conference|Bandung conference]] in [[Indonesia]], where his performance earned him the epithet ''Bandung Booruwa'' (Bandung Donkey) in Sri Lanka. At the conference he stated his belief that fashionably Marxist anti-colonialist rhetoric ignored Communist atrocities. In a private conversation with the prime ministers of Pakistan, India, Burma, and China, he asked Chinese premier [[Zhou Enlai]] if he wanted to bring Communism to Tibet. Zhou replied that it was impractical and undesirable, and that the PRC had gone to Tibet because it was \"an integral part of the Chinese state\" and because it had been threatened by \"imperialist intrigues\" from the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jawaharlal Nehru: Letters to Chief Ministers 1957-1964|volume=4|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=159\u2013171|editor=Parthasarathy, Gopalapuram}}</ref>\n\n===Electoral defeat===\nHis government had to deal with economic problems and ethnic conflicts. Although his parliamentary term was valid till 1957, he had Parliament dissolved in 1956 calling for fresh elections. However the UNP faced a major defeat in the [[1956 Ceylonese parliamentary election|1956 general elections]] by a group of more radically chauvinistic [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] parties under the leadership of [[Solomon Bandaranaike]]. The UNP was only able to win eight seats in parliament.\n\n==Final years in Parliament==\nKotelawala retained his parliamentary seat having been reelected from the Dodangaslanda electorate, however he returning the party leadership to [[Dudley Senanayake]]. He did not contest the [[March 1960 Ceylonese parliamentary election|1960 general elections]], instead he supported the candidacy of [[A. U. Romanis]], his personal [[chauffeur]], as the UNP candidate for Dodangaslanda. Romanis won both general elections in 1960 and remained a member of parliament till 1964.\n\n==Later life==\nKotelawala retired from politics shortly after his electoral defeat. He bought the Brogues Wood estate at [[Biddenden]] in [[Kent]], where he lived for several years. He eventually returned to Ceylon. When the post of [[Governor-General of Ceylon|Governor-General]] appeared vacant with completion of [[William Gopallawa]]'s first term, he was hopeful that he would be nominated to the post by the United National Party which was in the government at the time. However [[Dudley Senanayake]] in his second term as Prime Minister did not name a successor for Gopallawa and allowed him to have a second term.\n\n===Defence university===\nKotelawala was a strong supporter of the military and maintained close links with the army. He was the first Chairman of the Ceylon Light Infantry Association in 1974 and was the President of the Ceylon Ex Servicemen's Association from 1948 to his death. In 1978, the commanders of the armed forces identified a need to establish a Defence university to cater to the academic training of its officers. Although the government approved it, funds were limited and no location was provided by the government. In 1979, [[Lieutenant General]] [[Denis Perera]], [[Commander of the Army (Sri Lanka)|Commander of the Sri Lankan Army]] approached Kotelawala with the proposal of donating his home [[Kandawala]] and its 50 acres estate to the state to establish a Defence university. Six months later in 1980, having reviewed the proposal and consulted his heirs, Kotelawala agreed to donate Kandawala following his death. Shortly after he signed a deed of gift with the President, transferring Kandawala and a formal ceremony to establish the institution was scheduled for 11 October 1980.<ref>[http://www.army.lk/detailed.php?NewsId=103 Commander Pays Tribute to Late Sir John Kotelawala ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411014907/http://www.army.lk/detailed.php?NewsId=103 |date=11 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn 29 September 1980 he suffered a stroke at Kandawala and was taken to the cardiac unit of the [[Colombo General Hospital]].

H. Dias Bandaranaike and Maria Frances Dias Bandaranaike ''nee'' Senanayake. Effie Bandaranaike was the niece of [[Don Stephen Senanayake]]. Although the marriage was not successful, ending in divorce, it produced a daughter Lakshmi Kotelawala who married Henry Gerald Kotalawala.<ref>[http://www.sundaytimes.lk/140209/sunday-times-2/how-kotelawala-snr-got-young-brother-in-law-killed-84856.html How Kotelawala (Snr) got young brother-in-law killed ]</ref>\n\nKotelawala was known for his flamboyance and the company he kept. He would entertain guests at his home at Kandawala and his cottage in Nuware eliya. Even as Prime Minister he resided at Kotelawala.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1985 a national defence academy for training of officers for all three Sri Lankan defence services was established at his estate [[Kandawala]], which he had left to the country in his will for this purpose. It has been named '''[[General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University]]''' (KDU) is a defence university offering undergraduate and post graduate study courses to officers of the defence services in Sri Lanka in various disciplines. Statues of Sir John Kotelawala have been erected in many parts of the island, including one at the [[Old Parliament Building, Colombo]].

{"title_page": "Devonshire Parish", "text_new": "'''Devonshire Parish''' is one of the nine parishes of [[Bermuda]]. Originally named ''Cavendish Tribe'' after [[Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford|Lucy Bedford, Countess of Cavendish]] and later Devonshire Tribe, for [[William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire]] (1552\u20131626), neither of whom had ever visited Bermuda, despite a parish being named after them. ''Devonshire Redoubt'', on [[Castle Island, Bermuda|Castle Island]], one of the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Harbour fortifications]] of [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St. George's Parish]], was also named after him.\n\n[[Image:Bermuda-Devonshire.png|thumb|right|200px]]\n\n==Location==\nIt is located in the centre of the territory, close to the junction between the main part of the main island and the peninsula containing the capital, [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], and [[Pembroke Parish, Bermuda|Pembroke Parish]] (to which it is joined in the west). To the northeast, it is joined to [[Smith's Parish, Bermuda|Smith's Parish]], and to the southwest it borders [[Paget Parish, Bermuda|Paget Parish]]. As with most of Bermuda's parishes, it covers just over {{convert|2.3|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. North Shore Road, Middle Road, and South Shore Road all go through this parish.

Devonshire Bay is located on the South shore of Bermuda. There is a national park here and remnants of a fort. Boats moor in the bay for its relatively calm waters. The remnants of the fort was one of the forts from the \"fortress Bermuda\" project when Bermuda was becoming militarized after the American Revolution. This is the only public beach on the south shore of Devonshire.\n\nDevonshire marsh is in the center of the parish and is on the north side of Middle Road. It was originally known as \"brackish pond\", which gave the parish its very first name before being officially named. It has been hit by human development over the years; sections were drained for farming and commercial activities. In 1996 there was a significant fire in Devonshire marsh, but the area has recovered since then. There are two nature reserves in the marsh area for its protection - the Firefly and Freer cox nature reserves.\n\nOther, less known natural features include Robinson bay, Orange Valley, Palmetto Park, Garthowen Park, and Friendship Vale Park.\n\n==Education==\nPublic schools in Devonshire Parish:\n* Devonshire Preschool<ref>[http://schools.moed.bm/DVP/default.aspx Home].

To the northeast, it is joined to [[Smith's Parish, Bermuda|Smith's Parish]], and to the southwest it borders [[Paget Parish, Bermuda|Paget Parish]]. As with most of Bermuda's parishes, it covers just over {{convert|2.3|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. North Shore Road, Middle Road, and South Shore Road all go through this parish. It had a population of 7,087 in 2016.<ref name=\"Bermuda 2016 Census\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.bm/sites/default/files/2016%20Census%20Report.pdf |title=Bermuda 2016 Census |publisher=Bermuda Department of Statistics |date = December 2016|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Natural features==\nNatural features in Devonshire include [[Devonshire Bay, Bermuda|Devonshire Bay]], and Devonshire Marsh. Devonshire Bay is located on the South shore of Bermuda. There is a national park here and remnants of a fort. Boats moor in the bay for its relatively calm waters. The remnants of the fort was one of the forts from the \"fortress Bermuda\" project when Bermuda was becoming militarized after the American Revolution. This is the only public beach on the south shore of Devonshire.\n\nDevonshire marsh is in the center of the parish and is on the north side of Middle Road. It was originally known as \"brackish pond\", which gave the parish its very first name before being officially named. It has been hit by human development over the years; sections were drained for farming and commercial activities. In 1996 there was a significant fire in Devonshire marsh, but the area has recovered since then. There are two nature reserves in the marsh area for its protection - the Firefly and Freer cox nature reserves.\n\nOther, less known natural features include Robinson bay, Orange Valley, Palmetto Park, Garthowen Park, and Friendship Vale Park.\n\n==Education==\nPublic schools in Devonshire Parish:\n* Devonshire Preschool<ref>[http://schools.moed.bm/DVP/default.aspx Home].
