This early use of electrospun fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that various cell types including Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFF), transformed Human Carcinoma (HEp-2), and Mink Lung Epithelium (MLE) would adhere to and proliferate upon the fibers.

Cell-based HTS relies on rapid determination of cellular response to drug interaction, such as dose dependent cell viability, cell-cell/cell-matrix interaction, and/or cell migration, but the available assays are not optimized for 3D cell culturing. Another challenge faced by 3D cell culturing is the limited amount of data and publications that address mechanisms and correlations of drug interaction, cell differentiation, and cell-signalling in these 3D environments. None of the 3D methods have yet replaced 2D culturing on a large scale, including in the [[drug development]] process; although the number of 3D cell culturing publications is increasing rapidly, the current limited biochemical characterization of 3D tissue diminishes the adoption of new methods.\n\nThere are also problems using spheroids as a model for cancerous tissue. Although beneficial for 3D tissue culture, tumor spheroids have been criticized for being challenging or impossible to \u201cmanipulate gradients of soluble molecules in [3D spheroid] constructs, and to characterize cells in these complex gradients\u201d, unlike the paper-supported 3D cell culture for tissue-based bioassays explored by Ratmir et al.<ref name=\"AutoRefB\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Cell culture]]\n*[[Cell lines]]\n*[[Cell culture assay]]\n*[[Hydrogel]]\n*[[Madin-Darby Canine Kidney|Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cell line]]\n*[[Microphysiometry]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cell culture]]\n[[Category:Bioreactors]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Free-floating three-dimensional culture of cells}}\nA '''3D cell culture''' is an artificially created environment in which biological cells are permitted to grow or interact with their surroundings in all three dimensions.

Another challenge faced by 3D cell culturing is the limited amount of data and publications that address mechanisms and correlations of drug interaction, cell differentiation, and cell-signalling in these 3D environments. None of the 3D methods have yet replaced 2D culturing on a large scale, including in the [[drug development]] process; although the number of 3D cell culturing publications is increasing rapidly, the current limited biochemical characterization of 3D tissue diminishes the adoption of new methods.\n\nThere are also problems using spheroids as a model for cancerous tissue.

{"title_page": "Embalming chemicals", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=November 2008}}\n\n[[File:Embalming fluid.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Various early 20th Century embalming fluids]]\n'''Embalming chemicals''' are a variety of preservatives, sanitising and disinfectant agents, and additives used in modern [[embalming]] to temporarily prevent [[decomposition]] and restore a natural appearance for [[viewing (funeral)|viewing]] a body after death. A mixture of these chemicals is known as '''embalming fluid''' and is used to preserve bodies of deceased persons for both funeral purposes and in medical research in anatomical laboratories. The period for which a body is embalmed is dependent on time, expertise of the embalmer and factors regarding duration of stay and purpose. \n\nTypically, embalming fluid contains a mixture of [[formaldehyde]], [[glutaraldehyde]], [[methanol]], and other solvents. The formaldehyde content generally ranges from 5 to 37 percent and the methanol content may range from 9 to 56 percent.\n\nIn the United States alone, about 20 million liters (roughly 5.3 million gallons) of embalming fluid are used every year.<ref name=\"PERC\">Sehee, Joe (2007). [http://perc.org/articles/green-burial-its-only-natural Green Burial: It's Only Natural], [[PERC Reports]], Winter 2007. Retrieved on 2013-11-06.</ref>\n\n== How they work ==\nEmbalming fluid acts to ''[[fixation (histology)|fix]]'' ([[denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]]) cellular proteins, meaning that they cannot act as a nutrient source for bacteria; embalming fluid also kills the bacteria themselves. Formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde fixes tissue or cells by irreversibly connecting a primary amine group in a protein molecule with a nearby nitrogen in a protein or DNA molecule through a -CH<sub>2</sub>- linkage called a [[Schiff base]]. The end result also creates the simulation, via color changes, of the appearance of blood flowing under the skin.\n\nModern embalming is not done with a single fixative. Instead, various chemicals are used to create a mixture, called an arterial solution, which is uniquely generated for the needs of each case. For example, a body needing to be repatriated overseas needs a higher index (percentage of diluted preservative chemical) than one simply for [[viewing (funeral)|viewing]] (known in the United States and Canada as a [[Funeral#Visitation|funeral visitation]]) at a funeral home before [[cremation]] or burial.\n\n==Process==\n[[File:Container containing embalming fluid.jpg|thumb|Tank containing embalming fluid]]\n{{main|Embalming}}\nEmbalming fluid is injected into the arterial system of the deceased. Many other bodily fluids may also be displaced and removed from the body using the arterial system and in the case of cavity treatment aspirated from the body and replaced with a specialty fluid known as cavity fluid.\n\n==Chemicals and additives==\nIt is important to distinguish between an arterial chemical (or fluid), which is generally taken to be the product in its original composition, and an arterial solution, which is a diluted mixture of chemicals and made to order for each body. Non-preservative chemicals in an arterial solution are generally called \"accessory chemicals\" or co/pre-injectants, depending on their time of utilization.\n\nPotential ingredients in an arterial solution include:\n\n*Preservative (Arterial) Chemical. These are commonly a percentage (normally 18\u201337%) based mixture of [[formaldehyde]], [[glutaraldehyde]] or in some cases [[phenol]] which are then diluted to gain the final index of the arterial solution. Methanol is used to hold the formaldehyde in solution. [[Formalin]] refers specifically to 37% aqueous formaldehyde and is not commonly used in funeral embalming but rather in the preservation of anatomical specimens.\n*Water Conditioner. These are designed to balance the \"hardness\" of water (the presence of other trace chemicals that change the water's pH or neutrality) and to help reduce the deceased's acidity, a by-product of decomposition, as formaldehyde works best in an [[alkaline]] environment.  Additionally, water conditioners may be used to help inactivate chemotherapy drugs and antibiotics, which may bind to and render ineffectual the preservative chemical.\n*Cell Conditioner. These chemicals act to prepare cells for absorption of arterial fluid and help break up clots in the bloodstream.\n*Dyes. Active dyes are used to restore the body's natural colouration and counterstain against conditions such as [[jaundice]] as well as to indicate distribution of arterial fluid.  Inactive dyes are used by the manufacturer of the arterial fluid to give a pleasant color to the fluid in the bottle but do nothing for the appearance of the embalmed body.\n*Humectants. These are added to dehydrated and emaciated bodies to help restore tissue to a more natural and hydrated appearance.\n*Anti-Edemic Chemicals. The opposite of humectants, these are designed to draw excessive fluid ([[edema]]) from a body.\n*Additional Disinfectants. For certain cases, such as [[tissue gas]], speciality chemicals such as Omega Decomp Factor, Triton-28, STOP or Dispray (Topical) can be arterially injected to kill tissue gas. \n*Water. Most arterial solutions are a mix of some of the preceding chemicals with tepid water. Cases done without the addition of water are referred to as \"waterless.\" Waterless embalming is sometimes effective and not often considered too expensive for everyday cases. Some, however see a waterless injection as nearly impossible to achieve due to the amount of water already in embalming fluids.\n*Cavity Fluid. This is a generally a very high-index [[formaldehyde]] or [[glutaraldehyde]] solution injected undiluted directly via the trocar incision into the body cavities to treat the viscera. In cases of tissue gas, [[phenol]] based products are often used instead.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the advent of the modern range of embalming chemicals a variety of alternative additives have been used by embalmers, including [[epsom salts]] for edema cases and [[milk]] in cases of [[jaundice]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} but these are of limited effectiveness and can be chalked up as \"embalmer tricks\", as the validity of their use  has never been demonstrated by professional embalmers or mortuary science programs. \n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the Union Army, wanting to transport slain soldiers from the battlefields back home for burial, consulted with Dr. Thomas Holmes, who developed a technique that involved draining a corpse's blood and embalming it with a fluid made with [[arsenic]] for preservation.<ref name=\"PERC\"/>\n\nEmbalming chemicals are generally produced by specialist manufacturers, The oldest embalming fluid company is the Champion Company, which was founded in 1878, followed by the Dodge Company in 1893, with other companies include Egyptian, now U.S. Chemical, as well as Kelco Supply Company (formerly L H Kellogg), Pierce Chemical Company (now owned by The Wilbert Company), Bondol Chemical Company, and Hydrol Chemical Company. There are many smaller and regional producers as well. Some funeral homes produce their own embalming fluids, although this practice has declined in recent decades as commercially available products have become of better quality and more readily available.\n\nFollowing the EU Biocides Legislation some pressure was brought to reduce the use of formaldehyde. [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] Classes [[Formaldehyde]] as a [[:Category:IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Class 1 Carcinogen]]. There are alternatives to formaldehyde and phenol-based fluids, but these are technically not preservatives but rather sanitising agents and are not widely accepted. However, The Champion Company has always been aware of the safety of the embalmer and created and distributed lower exposure fluids with less HCHO and by the 1990s Champion was the first to create and distribute HCHO Free Fluids. Only The Champion and The Dodge Company sell those fluids.\n\n==Environmental effects==\n\nWhen an embalmed body is buried and decays, the embalming fluid can seep into the ground and affect the surrounding soil and water ecosystems. while embalming fluid largely consists of water, it is the chemical that has the most dramatic effect on its surroundings.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Drinking Grandma: The Problem of Embalming|last = Chiappelli|first = Jeremiah|date = 2008|journal = Journal of Environmental Health|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Chiappelli|first2 = Ted|issue = 71}}</ref> The fluid that is injected into the blood vessels of the cadaver is up to 5% formaldehyde while the fluid injected into the body cavity is up to 37%.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/business/despite-cancer-risk-embalmers-stay-with-formaldehyde.html?_r=0|title = Despite Risk, Embalmers Still Embrace Preservative|last = Martin|first = Andrew|date = July 20, 2011|work = Newspaper|access-date = |via = The New York TImes}}</ref>\n\nFormaldehyde works to stiffen the tissue of the cadaver, allowing the mortician to pose the body. This is the characteristic that also makes formaldehyde hazardous when encountered in the environment. The carbon atom in formaldehyde, CH<sub>2</sub>O, carries a slight positive charge due to the high [[electronegativity]] of the oxygen double bonded with the carbon. The electropositive carbon will react with a negatively charged molecule and other electron-rich species. As a result, the carbon in the formaldehyde molecule bonds with electron-rich nitrogen groups called [[amine]]s found in plant and animal tissue.

However, The Champion Company has always been aware of the safety of the embalmer and created and distributed lower exposure fluids with less HCHO and by the 1990's Champion was the first to create and distribute HCHO Free Fluids. Only The Champion and The Dodge Company sell those fluids.\n\n==Environmental effects==\n\nWhen an embalmed body is buried and decays, the embalming fluid can seep into the ground and affect the surrounding soil and water ecosystems. while embalming fluid largely consists of water, it is the chemical that has the most dramatic effect on its surroundings.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Drinking Grandma: The Problem of Embalming|last = Chiappelli|first = Jeremiah|date = 2008|journal = Journal of Environmental Health|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Chiappelli|first2 = Ted|issue = 71}}</ref> The fluid that is injected into the blood vessels of the cadaver is up to 5% formaldehyde while the fluid injected into the body cavity is up to 37%.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/business/despite-cancer-risk-embalmers-stay-with-formaldehyde.html?_r=0|title = Despite Risk, Embalmers Still Embrace Preservative|last = Martin|first = Andrew|date = July 20, 2011|work = Newspaper|access-date = |via = The New York TImes}}</ref>\n\nFormaldehyde works to stiffen the tissue of the cadaver, allowing the mortician to pose the body. This is the characteristic that also makes formaldehyde hazardous when encountered in the environment. The carbon atom in formaldehyde, CH<sub>2</sub>O, carries a slight positive charge due to the high [[electronegativity]] of the oxygen double bonded with the carbon. The electropositive carbon will react with a negatively charged molecule and other electron-rich species. As a result, the carbon in the formaldehyde molecule bonds with electron-rich nitrogen groups called [[amine]]s found in plant and animal tissue. This leads to formaldehyde [[cross-link]]ing, bonding proteins with other proteins and [[DNA]], rendering them dysfunctional or no longer useful.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Molecular Level Answers: The Real Reason Why Formaldehyde is Toxic--and how to avoid it|url = http://drholly.typepad.com/question_and_answer_forum/2011/06/th.html|website = drholly.typepad.com|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}</ref>\n\nFormaldehyde is featured on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's list of the top 10 most hazardous chemicals for damaging the environment.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is carcinogenic in humans and animals<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|title = Formaldehyde (HSG 57, 1991)|url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/hsg/hsg/hsg057.htm|website = www.inchem.org|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|title = Formaldehyde CASRN 50-00-0 {{!}} IRIS {{!}} US EPA, ORD|url = http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris2/chemicalLanding.cfm?substance_nmbr=419|website = cfpub.epa.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-28|first = US EPA, ORD, Integrated Risk Information System|last = Division}}</ref> because the cross-linking can cause DNA to keep cells from halting the replication process.

John Brown''''' was a criminal trial held in [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town, Virginia]], in October of 1859. The [[abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was prosecuted for his involvement in a [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raid]] on the United States federal [[arsenal]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry, Virginia]]. (Since 1863, both Charles Town and Harpers Ferry are in [[History of West Virginia|West Virginia]].) On October 16\u201318, 1859, Brown led 21 armed men, 5 blacks and 16 white, to Harpers Ferry, an important [[railroad junction]]. His goal was to seize the federal arsenal there and then lead a slave insurrection across the South. Brown and his men engaged in a two-day standoff with local militia and federal troops, in which ten of his men were shot or killed, five were captured, and five escaped.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2940.html\n|title=Africans in America\n|chapter=The raid on Harpers Ferry\n|publisher=[[PBS]]\n|author=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]\n|year=1998}}</ref> Brown was captured and put on trial in a Virginia state court for treason, murder, and fomenting a slave insurrection. He was found guilty on all counts, and hanged on December 2.\n\nThanks to the recently-invented [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]], Brown's trial was the first to be reported nationally. Considering its aftermath, it was arguably the most important criminal trial in the history of the country, for it was closely related to the war that quickly followed. More than Brown's raid, his trial determined the fate of the Union. According to Brian McGinty, the \"Brown of history\" was thus born in his trial. Had Brown died before his trial, he would have been \"condemned as a madman and relegated to a footnote of history\". Robert McGlone added that \"the trial did magnify and exalt his image. But Brown's own efforts to fashion his ultimate public persona began long before the raid and culminated only in the weeks that followed his dramatic speech at his sentencing.\"<ref name=McGlone>{{cite article\n|title=Retrying John Brown: Was Virginia Justice \"Fair\"?\n|first=Robert E.\n|last=McGlone\n|magazine=[[Reviews in American History]]\n|volume=3\n|number=2\n|pages=292-298\n|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/441179}}</ref> After the sentencing, Brown, glad for the publicity, gave interviews to anyone who wanted to talk to him.\n\n==Trial==\n===Venue===\nBrown did not face federal charges. There were no federal court facilities nearby, and transporting the injured Brown and the other defendants to a large city and maintaining them there would have been difficult and expensive. And what would this gain? Murder was not a federal crime, and a federal indictment for treason or fomenting slave insurrection would have caused a political crisis (because so many abolitionists would have denounced it). Under Virginia law, fomenting a slave insurrection was clearly and unequivocally a crime. And the defendants could be tried where they were, in Charles Town. \"[[President Buchanan]] was indifferent to where Brown and his men were tried. ...Virginia Governor [[Henry A. Wise|Henry Wise]], on the other hand, was 'adamant' that the insurgents pay for their crimes through his state's judicial system.\"<ref name=McGlone/>{{rp|292}}\n\nThe trial, then, took place in the county courthouse in [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], not to be confused with [[Charleston, West Virginia]], the state capital. Charles Town is the county seat of [[Jefferson County, West Virginia|Jefferson County, Virginia]], about {{convert|7|mi}} west of Harpers Ferry. Since 1863 Jefferson County, including Harpers Ferry and Charles Town, is in West Virginia.\n\nA \"large armed force\" was stationed at Charles Town \"to prevent attempts at rescue.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|295}} Brown was brought into court \"accompanied by a body of armed men. Cannon were stationed in front of the court house, and an armed guard were {{sic}} patrolling round the jail.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|301}}\n\n===Grand jury===\nBrown faced a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] on Tuesday, October 25, 1859, just eight days after his capture in the armory. The grand jury was also considering the other prisoners to be tried with Brown: [[Aaron Dwight Stevens|Aaron Stephens]], [[Barclay Coppock|Edwin Coppie]], [[Shields Green]], and [[John Anthony Copeland Jr.|John Copland]]. At 5 PM the grand jury reported they had not yet finished questioning of witnesses, and the hearing was adjourned until the next day.  On October 26 the grand jury returned a true [[bill of indictment]] against Brown and the other defendants, charging them with:\n* \"Conspiring with negroes to produce insurrection\",\n* [[Treason laws in the United States|Treason]] against the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] of Virginia, and\n* Murder.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|298}}\n[[File:Trial of John Brown.jpg|thumb|350px|Trial of John Brown]]\n\n===Counsel===\nThe next question was what legal counsel Brown was to have. The Court assigned two \"Virginians and pro-slavery men\", John Faulkner and Lawson Botts, as counsel for him and the other accused. Brown did not accept them; he told the judge that he had sent for counsel, \"who have not had time to reach here\".<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|293}}\n\n{{quote|I did not ask for any quarter at the time I was taken; I did not ask to have my life spared.

Brown stated that he did not wish to use an insanity defense, as had been proposed to him.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|309}} A court-appointed lawyer said that a Virginia court could only try Brown for acts committed in Virginia, not in Maryland or the federal arsenal. State counsel denied this was relevant.\n\nBrown, having received by telegraph news from a lawyer in Ohio, asked for a delay of one day; this was denied. The state attorney said that Brown's real motive was \"to give to his friends the time and opportunity to organize a rescue.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|310}}\n\nOn Friday, October 28, \"Mr. Hoyt, a young Boston lawyer, arrived as a volunteer counsel for John Brown\".<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|317}}\n\n====Prosecution====\nThe prosecuting attorney was [[Andrew Hunter (lawyer)|Andrew Hunter]].\n\nThe central prosecution witness in the trial was Colonel [[Lewis Washington]], of [[George Washington|President Washington]]'s family, who had been kidnapped out of his home and held hostage near the Federal Armory. His slaves were militarily \"[[impressment|impressed]]\" ([[conscription in the United States|conscripted]]) by Brown, but they took no active part in the insurrection. Other local witnesses testified to the seizure of the Federal Armory, the appearance of Virginia militia groups, and shootings on the railroad bridge. Other evidence described the U.S. Marines' raid on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad engine house occupied by Brown and his men. U.S. Army Colonel Robert E. Lee and cavalry officer [[J. E. B. Stuart]] led the Marine raid, and it freed the hostages and ended the standoff. Lee did not appear at the trial to testify, but instead filed an affidavit to the court with his account of the Marines raid.\n\nThe manuscript evidence was of particular interest to the judge and jury. Many documents were found on the Maryland farm rented by John Brown under the alias Isaac Smith. These included a [[Provisional Constitution]] for a new state, which Brown and his officers had signed. These documents clinched the treason and pre-meditated murder charges against Brown. The defense called no witnesses, and Brown himself did not testify.\n\nThe prosecution concluded its examination of witnesses. The defense called witnesses, but they did not appear as subpoenas had not been served on them. Mr. Hoyt said that other counsel for Brown would arrive that evening. Both court-appointed attorneys then resigned, and the trial was adjourned until the next day.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|323}}\n\n====Defense====\nThe trial resumed on Saturday, October 29. Two lawyers for Brown appeared, one from Washington and the other from Ohio. They asked for a few hours to read the indictment and the testimony so far given; thus was denied.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|325\u2013326}} The defense called six witnesses.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|326\u2013328}}\n\n\n [[George Henry Hoyt|George H. Hoyt]], another prominent lawyer, arrived a few days later from Massachusetts and took a hesitant role in the closing days of the trial. Hoyt was hired to defend Brown by John W. Le Barnes, one of the abolitionists who had given money to Brown in the past. Samuel Chilton, a lawyer from Washington D.C., was also brought in as Brown's legal counsel.  Hiram Griswold, a lawyer from Cleveland, Ohio, arrived late in the trial on October 31 and delivered the defense's closing argument.\n\nThe defense claimed that the Harpers Ferry Federal Armory was not on Virginia property, but since the murdered townspeople had died in the streets outside the perimeter of the Federal facility, this carried little weight with the jury. John Brown's lack of official citizenship in Virginia was presented as a defense against treason against the State. Judge Parker dispatched this claim by reference to \"rights and responsibilities\" and the overlapping citizenship requirements between the Federal union and the various states. John Brown, an American citizen, could be found guilty of treason against Virginia on the basis of his temporary residence there during the days of the insurrection.\n\nThree other substantive defense tactics failed. One claimed that since the insurrection was aimed at the U.S. government it could not be proved treason against Virginia. Since Brown and his men had fired upon Virginia troops and police, this point was mooted. His lawyers also said that since no slaves had joined the insurrection, the charge of leading a slave insurrection should be thrown out. The jury apparently did not favor this claim, either.\n\nExtenuating circumstances were claimed by the defense when they stressed that Colonel Washington and the other hostages were not harmed and were in fact protected by Brown during the siege. This claim was not persuasive as Colonel Washington testified that he had seen men die of gunshot wounds and had been confined for days.\n\nThe final plea by the defense team for mercy concerned the circumstances surrounding the death of two of John Brown's men, who were apparently fired upon and killed by the Virginia militia while under a flag of truce. The armed community surrounding the Federal Arsenal did not hold their fire when Brown's men emerged to parley. This incident is noticeable upon a close reading of the published testimony, but is generally neglected in more popular accounts. If the rebels under a flag of truce were fired upon, it did not appear to be a major issue to the biased judge and jury.\n\n===The verdict===\nThe prosecution began its closing argument on Friday, concluding on Monday, October 31.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|333}} The jury retired to consider its verdict.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|334\u2013336}}\n\nThe jury deliberated for only 45 minutes. When it returned, according to the report in the ''[[New York Herald]]'', \"the only calm and unruffled countenance there\" was that of Brown. When the jury reported that it found him guilty of all charges, \"not the slightest sound was heard in the vast crowd\".<ref name=Liberator041159>{{cite news\n|newspaper=[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]\n|title=The Harper's Ferry Tragedy.

He arose and made what his first biographer called \"[his] last speech\":<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|340}}\n\n{{quote|I have, may it please the court, a few words to say.\n\nIn the first place, I deny everything but what I have all along admitted, the design on my part to free the slaves. I intended certainly to have made a clean thing of that matter, as I did last winter, when I went into Missouri and there took slaves without the snapping of a gun on either side, moved them through the country, and finally left them in Canada. I designed to have done the same thing again, on a larger scale. That was all I intended. I never did intend murder, or treason, or the destruction of property, or to excite or incite slaves to rebellion, or to make insurrection.\n\nI have another objection; and that is, it is unjust that I should suffer such a penalty. Had I interfered in the manner which I admit, and which I admit has been fairly proved (for I admire the truthfulness and candor of the greater portion of the witnesses who have testified in this case), had I so interfered in behalf of the rich, the powerful, the intelligent, the so-called great, or in behalf of any of their friends, either father, mother, brother, sister, wife, or children, or any of that class, and suffered and sacrificed what I have in this interference, it would have been all right; and every man in this court would have deemed it an act worthy of reward rather than punishment.\n\nThis court acknowledges, as I suppose, the validity of the law of God. I see a book kissed here which I suppose to be the Bible, or at least the New Testament. That teaches me that all things whatsoever I would that men should do to me, I should do even so to them {{bracket|{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew|chapter=7|verse=12}}}}. It teaches me, further, to \"remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them\" {{bracket|{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Hebrews|chapter=13|verse=3}}}}. I endeavored to act up to that instruction. I say, I am yet too young to understand that God is any respecter of persons. I believe that to have interfered as I have done as I have always freely admitted I have done in behalf of His despised poor, was not wrong, but right. Now, if it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I submit; so let it be done!\n\nLet me say one word further.\n\nI feel entirely satisfied with the treatment I have received on my trial. Considering all the circumstances and animosity toward me, it has been fair and more generous than I expected. But I feel no consciousness of guilt. I have stated from the first [day] what was my intention and what was not. I never had any design against the life of any person, nor any disposition to commit treason, or excite slaves to rebel, or make any general insurrection. I never encouraged any man to do so, but always discouraged any idea of that kind.\n\nLet me say, also, a word in regard to the statements made by some of those connected with me. I hear it has been stated by some of them that I have induced them to join me. But the contrary is true. I do not say this to injure them, but as regretting their weakness. There is not one of them but joined me of his own accord, and the greater part of them at their own expense. A number of them I never saw, and never had a word of conversation with, till the day they came to me; and that was for the purpose I have stated.\n\nNow I have done.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|340\u2013342}}}}\n\nThe judge sentenced him to death by hanging on December 2;<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|340\u2013342}} under Virginia law a month was to elapse between the sentence of death and its execution.

John Brown''''' was a criminal trial held in [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town, Virginia]], in October of 1859. The [[abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was prosecuted for his involvement in a [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raid]] on the United States federal [[arsenal]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry, Virginia]]. (Since 1863, both Charles Town and Harpers Ferry are in [[History of West Virginia|West Virginia]].) On October 16\u201318, 1859, Brown led 21 armed men, 5 blacks and 16 white, to Harpers Ferry, an important [[railroad junction]]. His goal was to seize the federal arsenal there and then lead a slave insurrection across the South. Brown and his men engaged in a two-day standoff with local militia and federal troops, in which ten of his men were shot or killed, five were captured, and five escaped.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2940.html\n|title=Africans in America\n|chapter=The raid on Harpers Ferry\n|publisher=[[PBS]]\n|author=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]\n|year=1998}}</ref> Brown was captured and put on trial in a Virginia state court for treason, murder, and fomenting a slave insurrection. He was found guilty on all counts, and hanged on December 2.\n\nThanks to the recently-invented [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]], Brown's trial was the first to be reported nationally. Considering its aftermath, it was arguably the most important criminal trial in the history of the country, for it was closely related to the war that quickly followed. More than Brown's raid, his trial determined the fate of the Union. According to Brian McGinty, the \"Brown of history\" was thus born in his trial. Had Brown died before his trial, he would have been \"condemned as a madman and relegated to a footnote of history\". Robert McGlone added that \"the trial did magnify and exalt his image. But Brown's own efforts to fashion his ultimate public persona began long before the raid and culminated only in the weeks that followed his dramatic speech at his sentencing.\"<ref name=McGlone>{{cite article\n|title=Retrying John Brown: Was Virginia Justice \"Fair\"?\n|first=Robert E.\n|last=McGlone\n|magazine=[[Reviews in American History]]\n|volume=3\n|number=2\n|pages=292-298\n|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/441179}}</ref> After the sentencing, Brown, glad for the publicity, gave interviews to anyone who wanted to talk to him.\n\n==Trial==\n===Venue===\nBrown did not face federal charges. There were no federal court facilities nearby, and transporting the injured Brown and the other defendants to a large city and maintaining them there would have been difficult and expensive. And what would this gain? Murder was not a federal crime, and a federal indictment for treason or fomenting slave insurrection would have caused a political crisis (because so many abolitionists would have denounced it). Under Virginia law, fomenting a slave insurrection was clearly and unequivocally a crime. And the defendants could be tried where they were, in Charles Town. \"[[President Buchanan]] was indifferent to where Brown and his men were tried. ...Virginia Governor [[Henry A. Wise|Henry Wise]], on the other hand, was 'adamant' that the insurgents pay for their crimes through his state's judicial system.\"<ref name=McGlone/>{{rp|292}}\n\nThe trial, then, took place in the county courthouse in [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], not to be confused with [[Charleston, West Virginia]], the state capital. Charles Town is the county seat of [[Jefferson County, West Virginia|Jefferson County, Virginia]], about {{convert|7|mi}} west of Harpers Ferry. Since 1863 Jefferson County, including Harpers Ferry and Charles Town, is in West Virginia.\n\nA \"large armed force\" was stationed at Charles Town \"to prevent attempts at rescue.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|295}} Brown was brought into court \"accompanied by a body of armed men. Cannon were stationed in front of the court house, and an armed guard were {{sic}} patrolling round the jail.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|301}}\n\n===Grand jury===\nBrown faced a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] on Tuesday, October 25, 1859, just eight days after his capture in the armory. The grand jury was also considering the other prisoners to be tried with Brown: [[Aaron Dwight Stevens|Aaron Stephens]], [[Barclay Coppock|Edwin Coppie]], [[Shields Green]], and [[John Anthony Copeland Jr.|John Copland]]. At 5 PM the grand jury reported they had not yet finished questioning of witnesses, and the hearing was adjourned until the next day.  On October 26 the grand jury returned a true [[bill of indictment]] against Brown and the other defendants, charging them with:\n* \"Conspiring with negroes to produce insurrection\"\n* [[Treason laws in the United States|Treason]] against the Commonwealth of Virginia\n* Murder<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|298}}\n\n[[File:Trial of John Brown.jpg|thumb|350px|Trial of John Brown]]\n\n===Counsel===\nThe next question was what legal counsel Brown was to have. The Court assigned two \"Virginians and pro-slavery men\", John Faulkner and Lawson Botts, as counsel for him and the other accused. Brown did not accept them; he told the judge that he had sent for counsel, \"who have not had time to reach here\".<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|293}}\n\n{{quote|I did not ask for any quarter at the time I was taken; I did not ask to have my life spared.

Brown stated that he did not wish to use an insanity defense, as had been proposed to him.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|309}} A court-appointed lawyer said that a Virginia court could only try Brown for acts committed in Virginia, not in Maryland or the federal arsenal. State counsel denied this was relevant.\n\nBrown, having received by telegraph news from a lawyer in Ohio, asked for a delay of one day; this was denied. The state attorney said that Brown's real motive was \"to give to his friends the time and opportunity to organize a rescue.\"<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|310}}\n\nOn Friday, October 28, \"Mr. Hoyt, a young Boston lawyer, arrived as a volunteer counsel for John Brown\".<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|317}}\n\n====Prosecution====\nThe prosecuting attorney was [[Andrew Hunter (lawyer)|Andrew Hunter]].\n\nThe central prosecution witness in the trial was Colonel [[Lewis Washington]], of [[George Washington|President Washington]]'s family, who had been kidnapped out of his home and held hostage near the Federal Armory. His slaves were militarily \"[[impressment|impressed]]\" ([[conscription in the United States|conscripted]]) by Brown, but they took no active part in the insurrection. Other local witnesses testified to the seizure of the Federal Armory, the appearance of Virginia militia groups, and shootings on the railroad bridge. Other evidence described the U.S. Marines' raid on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad engine house occupied by Brown and his men. U.S. Army Colonel Robert E. Lee and cavalry officer [[J. E. B. Stuart]] led the Marine raid, and it freed the hostages and ended the standoff. Lee did not appear at the trial to testify, but instead filed an affidavit to the court with his account of the Marines raid.\n\nThe manuscript evidence was of particular interest to the judge and jury. Many documents were found on the Maryland farm rented by John Brown under the alias Isaac Smith. These included a [[Provisional Constitution]] for a new state, which Brown and his officers had signed. These documents clinched the treason and pre-meditated murder charges against Brown. The defense called no witnesses, and Brown himself did not testify.\n\nThe prosecution concluded its examination of witnesses. The defense called witnesses, but they did not appear as subpoenas had not been served on them. Mr. Hoyt said that other counsel for Brown would arrive that evening. Both court-appointed attorneys then resigned, and the trial was adjourned until the next day.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|323}}\n\n====Defense====\nThe trial resumed on Saturday, October 29. Two lawyers for Brown appeared, one from Washington and the other from Ohio. They asked for a few hours to read the indictment and the testimony so far given; thus was denied.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|325\u2013326}} The defense called six witnesses.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|326\u2013328}}\n\n\n [[George Henry Hoyt|George H. Hoyt]], another prominent lawyer, arrived a few days later from Massachusetts and took a hesitant role in the closing days of the trial. Hoyt was hired to defend Brown by John W. Le Barnes, one of the abolitionists who had given money to Brown in the past. Samuel Chilton, a lawyer from Washington D.C., was also brought in as Brown's legal counsel.  Hiram Griswold, a lawyer from Cleveland, Ohio, arrived late in the trial on October 31 and delivered the defense's closing argument.\n\nThe defense claimed that the Harpers Ferry Federal Armory was not on Virginia property, but since the murdered townspeople had died in the streets outside the perimeter of the Federal facility, this carried little weight with the jury. John Brown's lack of official citizenship in Virginia was presented as a defense against treason against the State. Judge Parker dispatched this claim by reference to \"rights and responsibilities\" and the overlapping citizenship requirements between the Federal union and the various states. John Brown, an American citizen, could be found guilty of treason against Virginia on the basis of his temporary residence there during the days of the insurrection.\n\nThree other substantive defense tactics failed. One claimed that since the insurrection was aimed at the U.S. government it could not be proved treason against Virginia. Since Brown and his men had fired upon Virginia troops and police, this point was mooted. His lawyers also said that since no slaves had joined the insurrection, the charge of leading a slave insurrection should be thrown out. The jury apparently did not favor this claim, either.\n\nExtenuating circumstances were claimed by the defense when they stressed that Colonel Washington and the other hostages were not harmed and were in fact protected by Brown during the siege. This claim was not persuasive as Colonel Washington testified that he had seen men die of gunshot wounds and had been confined for days.\n\nThe final plea by the defense team for mercy concerned the circumstances surrounding the death of two of John Brown's men, who were apparently fired upon and killed by the Virginia militia while under a flag of truce. The armed community surrounding the Federal Arsenal did not hold their fire when Brown's men emerged to parley. This incident is noticeable upon a close reading of the published testimony, but is generally neglected in more popular accounts. If the rebels under a flag of truce were fired upon, it did not appear to be a major issue to the biased judge and jury.\n\n===The verdict===\nThe prosecution began its closing argument on Friday, concluding on Monday, October 31.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|333}} The jury retired to consider its verdict.<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|334\u2013336}}\n\nThe jury deliberated for only 45 minutes. When it returned, according to the report in the ''[[New York Herald]]'', \"the only calm and unruffled countenance there\" was that of Brown.

He arose and made what his first biographer called \"[his] last speech\":<ref name=Redpath/>{{rp|340}}\n\n{{quote|I have, may it please the court, a few words to say.\n\nIn the first place, I deny everything but what I have all along admitted, the design on my part to free the slaves. I intended certainly to have made a clean thing of that matter, as I did last winter, when I went into Missouri and there took slaves without the snapping of a gun on either side, moved them through the country, and finally left them in Canada. I designed to have done the same thing again, on a larger scale. That was all I intended. I never did intend murder, or treason, or the destruction of property, or to excite or incite slaves to rebellion, or to make insurrection.\n\nI have another objection; and that is, it is unjust that I should suffer such a penalty. Had I interfered in the manner which I admit, and which I admit has been fairly proved (for I admire the truthfulness and candor of the greater portion of the witnesses who have testified in this case), had I so interfered in behalf of the rich, the powerful, the intelligent, the so-called great, or in behalf of any of their friends, either father, mother, brother, sister, wife, or children, or any of that class, and suffered and sacrificed what I have in this interference, it would have been all right; and every man in this court would have deemed it an act worthy of reward rather than punishment.\n\nThis court acknowledges, as I suppose, the validity of the law of God. I see a book kissed here which I suppose to be the Bible, or at least the New Testament. That teaches me that all things whatsoever I would that men should do to me, I should do even so to them {{bracket|{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew|chapter=7|verse=12}}}}.

I endeavored to act up to that instruction. I say, I am yet too young to understand that God is any respecter of persons.

[[John Wilkes Booth]] and Thomas Jackson (the future [[Stonewall Jackson]]) were present, along with 2,000 Federal troops and militia. On the short trip from the jail to the gallows he was protected on both sides by lines of troups, to prevent an armed rescue. Spectators and reporters were kept far enough away that he could not talk to them, and he made no final statement from the gallows. His last known words are those on a note, passed to a jailor who asked for an autograph:\n\n<blockquote>Charlestown, Va. 2nd December, 1859. I John Brown am now quite <u>certain</u> that the crimes of this <u>guilty, land: will</u> never be purged <u>away;</u> but with Blood. I had <u>as I now think: vainly</u> flattered myself that without <u>very much</u> bloodshed; it might be done.</blockquote>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"167px\" heights=\"167px\" >\nFile:John brown interior engine house.jpg|thumb|Interior of the engine house at the armory, just before the door is broken down.
