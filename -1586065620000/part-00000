As far as luck though, Colorado won 7-0 against the [[University of Denver]] on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nPrior to 1934, CU athletic teams were referred to as Arapahoes, Big Horns, Frontiersmen, Grizzlies, Hornets, Silver and Gold, Silver Helmets, and Yellow Jackets. The student newspaper decided to sponsor a national contest in the summer of 1934, with a $5 prize to go to the author of the winning selection. Over 1,000 entries arrived from almost every state. Athletic Director Harry Carlson, Graduate Manager Walter Franklin, and Kenneth Bundy of the Silver and Gold were the judges.\n\nLocal articles first reported that Claude Bates of New Madrid, Missouri, and James Proffitt of Cincinnati, Ohio, were co-winners for the prize as both submitted \u201cBuffaloes\u201d as their entry. However, a few days later, the newspaper declared Boulder resident A.J. \u201cAndy\u201d Dickson the winner, after a follow-up investigation revealed his submission of \u201cBuffaloes\u201d had actually arrived several days before those of the original winners. Through the years, synonyms which quickly came into use included Bisons, Buffs, Golden Avalanche, Golden Buffaloes, Stampeding Herd, and Thundering Herd.\n\nLive buffaloes made appearances at Colorado games on and off throughout the early years, usually in a pen on the field or sometimes driven around in a trailer. In the 1940s, the school kept a baby buffalo in a special pen at the University Riding Academy. The first named buffalo was \"Mr. Chips,\" who appeared for the first time at the 1957 CU Days Kickoff Rally and was cared for by a men's honorary society.\n\nIn 1966 the Student Body Government decided that the University of Colorado Boulder needed a full-time live buffalo mascot. Freshman Class Officer Bill Lowery talked to his father who purchased and donated the original \"Ralphie\" to Colorado in March 1966. The Student Body Government planned for it to be the job of the Sophomore Class Officer's to take Ralphie to all home football games.\"\n\nThere are a couple versions of the story on how Ralphie became the name of our beloved mascot. One story says the Student Body Government held a \"Name the Buffalo\" contest and received many entries. One entry was for \"Ralph,\" in honor of the Junior Class president at the time, Ralph Jay Wallace. Another story says that \"Ralph\" was chosen as her name by the Student Body Government in reference to the noise made when throwing up. What is known for sure is that the original spelling of her name was \"Rraalph\" but was changed to \"Ralphie\" at the end of the 1967 football season.\n\nRalphie first appeared on the sidelines of a football game on October 1, 1966. Colorado beat [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] 10-0. Around that same time, head football coach [[Eddie Crowder]] was approached with the idea of the buffalo charging out on the field before the game, the team closely following. After much discussion, the debut of this great tradition took place on September 16, 1967. Colorado beat [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]] 27-7. Ever since then Ralphie has been leading the way as the football team takes the field.\n\nAfter the 1967 football season, the Student Body Government realized it was not smart to have it be the tradition for the Sophomore Class Officers to run with Ralphie, and instead it would be better to have trained individuals with large animal experience take the tradition over.\n\nThe Ralphie Live Mascot Program has since evolved, becoming a prestigious athletic endeavor for 15 student athletes and buffalo enthusiasts. It is currently under the direction of Program Manager and Coach John Graves and Assistant Coach Taylor Stratton, both were Handlers when they were students at Colorado.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cubuffs.com/sports/2016/6/28/ralphie-history.aspx|title=Ralphie History|website=University of Colorado Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Ralphie I===\n[[Image:Colorado Ralphie I.jpg|thumb|right|Ralphie I served 1966\u201378]]<!-- Fair use image, see image description page for fair use rationale -->\nIn March 1966, John Lowery, the father of a Colorado freshman from Lubbock, Texas, purchased a six- month old buffalo calf from [[Sedgwick, Colorado|Sedgewick, Colorado]] for $150 and donated her to the University. Lowery bought the calf from rancher Art Kashcke. Bill Lowery (John's son), John McGill, Don Marturano, and Vic Reinking were the original Ralphie Handlers who trained Ralphie I.\n\nRalphie first attended a game on October 1, 1966 when Colorado played [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]]. Ralphie did not run onto the field during the game, but stood on the sideline and slept in her trailer. Colorado won the game 10-0. She attended the remaining three home football games that year, standing on the sidelines.\n\nAround that same time, head football coach [[Eddie Crowder]] was approached with the idea of the buffalo charging out onto the field before the game, the team closely following. After much discussion, the debut of this great tradition took place on September 16, 1967, when Colorado played [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]]. Colorado beat Baylor 27-7. Ever since then Ralphie has been leading the way as the football team takes the field. Ralphie's first bowl game was the Bluebonnet Bowl on December 23, 1967, where Colorado beat [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] (FL) 31-21. The five sophomores that \u2018handled\u2019 her appointed themselves as the board of directors of a fundraising effort to bring Ralphie to Houston. By selling \u201cBuffalo Stock,\u201d they raised the necessary funds to send Ralphie to Houston, and help cover other costs associated with the program.\n\nIn 1976, the President of The Bank of Boulder, Steve Bosley, proposed to Crowder they would do a fundraiser to send Ralphie to the Orange Bowl game against [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]]. When a reporter asked Bosley how Ralphie would travel to Miami, he explained that the information was top secret since Colorado was concerned that Ohio State students would try to kidnap, or \u201cbuffalo-nap\u201d Ralphie. The story of the potential \u201cbuffalo-napping\u201d made newspapers nationwide, featuring a picture of Ralphie in full charge with her Handlers. The story stimulated over $25,000 in donations. Ralphie's trip to the Orange Bowl cost $2,500, and the balance was put into a fund for Ralphie's future care.\n\nRalphie I attended every Colorado home football game for 13 years, including all bowl games, and retired at the end of the 1978 season. The team matured too, selecting and training knowledgeable Handlers. The Handlers wore classic western attire while working with Ralphie, and initially would wear their cowboy boots when running with Ralphie. In 1978 the Handlers began to wear athletic shoes when running with Ralphie instead of cowboy boots, finding that it was easier to run faster and guide Ralphie while in athletic shoes.\n\nColorado's first Ralphie achieved national celebrity status, and was even kidnapped in 1970 by some Air Force Academy cadets, as well as being named Colorado's 1971 Homecoming Queen at the height of the anti-establishment era. In 1968, Ralphie also ran for Student Body President with the slogan of \u201cWhat\u2019s It To You?\u201d She did not win the election.\n\nDuring the football season Ralphie lived at the Green Meadows Riding Stable, located near present-day East Campus of the University, owned by C.D. \u201cBuddy\u201d Hays. Hays not only cared for and trained Ralphie, he was also the coach of the Colorado Rodeo Club. The Ralphie Handlers would also practice and work with Ralphie in the arena of Green Meadows Riding Stable. In the off-season Ralphie lived on the pastures at Hidden Valley Ranch, where Hays also kept his herd of buffalo, located north of Boulder. Ralphie I lived at Hidden Valley Ranch until 1981 when she moved to the McKenzie Ranch located in North Boulder. Ralphie traveled in a modified steel, brown, 4-horse trailer, donated by Hays. She used a custom harness and headstall made by Ray Cornell out of Boulder, Colorado that lead ropes were attached to allow the Handlers to run with her and help guide her around the field.\n\nRalphie I also had four calves, the sire of the calves was a large bull at Hidden Valley Ranch named Barney. In May 1971, Ralphie's first calf unfortunately died during a strong snowstorm. In April 27, 1972, Buffie, named by Colorado students, was born, but died from pneumonia on October 18, 1972. She made one public appearance on October 14, 1972 at the Colorado Homecoming game against [[Iowa State Cyclones football|Iowa State]], standing on the sidelines. On April 16, 1974, her third calf, Streaker, was born, but died from an accident on the ranch in October 1974. Her fourth and final calf was Spirit who was born in August 1975. Ralphie I's fourth calf, Spirit made her public debut at the 1975 homecoming parade. She ran during the second half run of the CU vs. [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]] game behind Ralphie I. CU beat Missouri 31-20. She was sold to a local rancher shortly after, not having the correct disposition to become the next Ralphie. Ralphie I's final game was the first half run on November 18, 1978 against Iowa State. Colorado lost 16-20 to Iowa State. Ralphie I died on May 13, 1982, she was 16 years old.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cubuffs.com/sports/2016/6/15/ralphie-i.aspx|title=Ralphie I|website=University of Colorado Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Ralphie II===\n[[Image:Colorado Ralphie II.jpg|thumb|left|Ralphie II served 1978\u201387]]<!-- Fair use image, see image description page for fair use rationale -->\nIn 1978, when Ralphie I became ill, Steve Bosley organized a search for a new buffalo headed by Buddy Hays. Hays discovered a yearling buffalo named Moonshine, owned by Gregg C. Mackenzie. Bosley, The Bank of Boulder, and Bank Director Robert Confer bought Moonshine from Mackenzie for $1,000 and donated her to Colorado. Since \u201cRalphie\u201d had become the well-known name of the buffalo, Athletic Director [[Eddie Crowder]] made it permanent.\n\nRalphie II was originally named Moon as she was born during a lunar eclipse. Her mother unfortunately died during labor, and she was raised by ranch hands on the Broken Spear Ranch. In 1976, Mackenzie purchased Moon from Ron Gregory, owner of Broken Spear Ranch, and raised her for his FFA project at Smoky Hill High School in [[Aurora, Colorado]]. Her name changed to Moonshine as a more fitting name for a female buffalo.\n\nMackenzie continued to train Ralphie II and was an assistant coach when Buddy Hays left in 1979, until 1983. Jim Wright, who was a former Handler, took charge over coaching duties from 1979 \u2013 1987. In 1985, Ken Kramer, a Handler from 1980 \u2013 1983, took over the leadership of the program until 1988 after serving as an assistant coach in 1984. Ralphie II lived at Hidden Valley Ranch until 1981, when she moved to the McKenzie Ranch located in North Boulder. Ralphie II moved to several different ranches after living a few years at the McKenzie ranch, ending up at B-J Acres, north of Erie, Colorado in 1985. In 1985 Johnnie Parker took over the program and the training of Ralphie II as well as housed her at the Parker Ranch in Hudson, Colorado.\n\nRalphie II made her debut on November 18, 1978, the final home game of the season. Standing on the sideline as Ralphie I made her final run around the field for the first half run, Ralphie II took over for the second half run. Colorado lost 16-20 to Iowa State, but the Ralphie Program and name became a tradition. In 1979, Ralphie took a trip to [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado]] for the NCAA Skiing Championships to support the school's ski team, which [[Colorado Buffaloes ski team|Colorado]] won. In 1985, Colorado selected the homecoming theme of \u201cRalphie goes to Hollywood.\u201d In 1986, Ralphie made the trip to Oklahoma State University (OSU) and ran at the Colorado vs. [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]] game and stayed at OSU's veterinary clinic. Students from OSU broke into the clinic that night and spray painted \u201cOSU\u201d in orange letters on her side.\n\nRalphie II was transported around in the same modified steel, brown, 4-horse trailer that Ralphie I used. Initially Ralphie II used the same custom leather harness that Ralphie I used, but used a different headstall. The harness was modified to fit Ralphie II's bigger size than Ralphie I's. In 1986 a new harness and headstall was used by Ralphie, this one was built by Carl W. Pike Saddlery out of Boulder, Colorado, the same company who modified the original harness to fit Ralphie II. The new headstall featured the iconic brass \u201cCU\u201d emblem on the front. While always a part of the Athletic Department, it was not until 1987 when Ralphie Handlers first earned a Varsity Letter for their participation.\n\nRalphie II was also named an honorary member of the Colorado Wildlife Foundation in 1979. In the fall of 1986 Ralphie II was confirmed to be pregnant, but the calf died during the pregnancy. She was expected to retire at the end of the 1987 season. However, at the age of 12, and after serving the Buffs for 10 years, Ralphie II died on September 19, 1987, following a 31-17 Colorado win over [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]]. Ralphie II was buried in [[Hudson, Colorado]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cubuffs.com/sports/2016/6/16/Ralphie-II.aspx|title=Ralphie II|website=University of Colorado Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>{{-}}\n\n===Ralphie III===\n[[Image:Colorado Ralphie III.gif|thumb|right|Ralphie III served 1987\u201397]]<!-- Fair use image, see image description page for fair use rationale -->\nOn June 3, 1985, Chuck Brackenbury was out mending fences on the Joe Miller Ranch outside of [[Laramie, Wyoming]], when he noticed a buffalo giving birth early in the morning. He checked back later that night and discovered the mom had died during labor, but the calf was still alive just standing there all alone. He brought the calf back to his ranch where she was bottle-fed and raised with horses and a goat. She was originally given the name of Buffy. Brackenbury eventually sold her to Bob Renaud, a buffalo rancher in [[Hudson, Colorado]]. In September 1987, Johnnie and Shaaron Parker bought the 2-year old buffalo from Renaud and donated her to the University. Parker also trained and housed her. Ralphie III was a lot bigger and faster than her two predecessors, and was given the name Tequila because of her fiery personality.\n\nRalphie III was brought into action earlier than anticipated, making her debut run on November 7, 1987 at a home game against [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]]. She did attend the two home games after Ralphie II died, but did not run, instead standing on the sidelines. Ralphie III was being trained for the 1988 season, as Ralphie II was to retire following the 1987 season. When Ralphie II died earlier than anticipated, and after only five weeks of training, Ralphie III finished the 1987 season. The Buffs welcomed her with a 27-10 victory over Missouri. On August 26, 1990, Ralphie III traveled to Anaheim, California when Colorado took on [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] in the Pigskin Classic. Though she was in attendance, she did not run onto the field since stadium officials did not allowing it. The game ended in a tie, 31-31.\n\nOn October 22, 1988 when Colorado played [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], Ralphie III and a second buffalo named Vicky, led the football team onto the field to start the game. Vicky used Ralphie II's old harness for the run, but did not run at the start of the second half. Vicky was born in May 1988 in Wyoming. Though she was originally dubbed Ralphie IV, Vicky did not have the temperament to be the next Ralphie and was subsequently sold to buffalo rancher a short time later. CU lost to Oklahoma 14-17.\n\nIn 1991, Ted Davis joined the program as a coach. In 1994, Gail Pederson began helping with the Ralphie Program behind the scenes, overseeing all the logistics, scheduling, and planning for the program. Ralphie III was initially transported in the same modified steel, brown, 4-horse trailer that carried Ralphie I and II, but in 1992, a new custom steel, black stock trailer was purchased for Ralphie through a donation from [[Coors Brewing Company]]. Initially she used the same harness and headstall that was used by Ralphie II. In 1989 a new harness and headstall was used, again with a large brass \u201cCU\u201d on the front. The new harness and headstall was built by M. King Saddlery out of Boulder, Colorado.\n\nRalphie III was the first Ralphie to wear the \u201cRalphie Blanket.\u201d The blanket is a custom-made banner blanket that reads \"Go Buffaloes\" on one side, and \"Beat [the opposing team]\" on the other side, such as \"Beat CSU.\" Shaaron Parker maintained the blanket and updated the opposing team's name each week.\n\nRalphie III led the Buffaloes on the field in 73 games, including 62 times in Boulder, eight bowl games, two times in Fort Collins, Colorado, and once in Stillwater, Oklahoma. After 11 years of service, she died on January 20, 1998, at the age of 12. Her final game was against [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] on November 28, 1997. Colorado lost 24-27.\n\nAfter Ralphie's death, the Colorado State Senate passed State Resolution 98\u201310 by Senator Elsie Lacy, a tribute to Ralphie III, the University of Colorado buffalo mascot, stating: \"That the University of Colorado and fans alike have lost a most beloved mascot and are saddened by the occasion of Ralphie III's death.\" Ralphie III was buried in [[Hudson, Colorado]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cubuffs.com/sports/2016/6/16/Ralphie-III.aspx|title=Ralphie III|website=University of Colorado Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Ralphie IV===\n[[File:Colorado Ralphie IV secret location.jpg|thumb|left|Joshua Lawton, photographer for the ''Boulder Daily Camera'', gets a rare look at the secret home of Ralphie IV as her handlers prepare her before the Montana State game in 2006.]]<!-- Fair use image, see image description page for fair use rationale --><!-- Fair use image, see image description page for fair use rationale -->\nRalphie IV was born in April 1997 on the Flying D Ranch in [[Gallatin Gateway, Montana]], owned by [[Ted Turner]], who donated her to the University of Colorado. While out checking the herd, Todd Traucht the buffalo manager at Flying D, found a newborn abandoned buffalo with her mother nowhere to be found. After checking out the baby buffalo, he found bite marks around her neck from a coyote attack. Being an abandoned buffalo and just surviving a coyote attack, Traucht took her home to be bottle fed and raised by him and his wife Susie. Traucht named her Rowdy due to her excitable nature. She was released back to the herd, but would not bond with them. She was then donated to Colorado as a yearling in April 1998. Johnnie Parker, who trained and housed both Ralphie II and III, brought her back to Colorado from Montana and supervised her early training.\n\nParker retired from the program in May 1999, after 13 years of working with the program, and housing and training Ralphie II, III, and IV. Longtime Colorado supporters Dale and Lynn Johnson housed Ralphie for the following year and coach Ted Davis assumed the program duties for the 2000 season. In the summer of 2001, two former Ralphie Handlers and Colorado graduates, Benny Frei and Kevin Priola, took over the program including the housing of Ralphie IV. Ralphie IV was transported in the same custom steel, black stock trailer that carried Ralphie III. She also used the same harness and headstall that was used by Ralphie III. Ralphie IV also continued to wear the \u201cRalphie Blanket,\u201d being maintained by Priola's wife, Michelle, who also updated the opposing team's name each week.\n\nRalphie IV weighed about 1,100 pounds, over three times her weight when she made her debut against [[Colorado State Rams football|Colorado State University]] at [[Mile High Stadium]] in [[Denver]] on September 5, 1998. Colorado won 42-14. Her final game was also against Colorado State University on August 31, 2008. Colorado won that game 38-17. Ralphie IV retired after 10 years of service and lived out her retirement in Henderson, Colorado. She ran at all four Big-12 Conference Championship games that Colorado played in, and traveled to six bowl games. She also made a historic trip to Atlanta, Georgia in 2006 when Colorado played the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|University of Georgia]]. In total, she ran at 75 football games during her career. She died on March 19, 2017, due to liver failure. She would have turned 20 years old the next month, a long life for a buffalo. Ralphie IV was buried in [[Henderson, Colorado]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cubuffs.com/sports/2016/6/16/ralphie-iv.aspx|title=Ralphie IV|website=University of Colorado Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Ralphie V===\n[[Image:RalphieV.jpg|thumb|right|Ralphie V at her public introduction on November 17, 2007. She was 13 months old and weighed 450 lbs.]]\n\nRalphie V was born in October 2006 on the Vermejo Park Ranch located in [[Cimarron, New Mexico]], owned by [[Ted Turner]]. Like Ralphie IV, Ted Turner donated Ralphie V to the University. As the darkest calf in the herd, she was named \"Blackout\" by ranch hands. Ralphie Program Directors Benny Frei and Kevin Priola worked with Barney Coppedge, the Bison Manager at Vermejo Park Ranch, to bring Ralphie V to Colorado. Frei continues to house Ralphie V.\n\nRalphie V came to Colorado in January 2007, and was introduced at \"Ralphie\u2019s Salute to a New Era\" on November 17, 2007. A little over one-year-old, she weighed in at 450 pounds. Her debut game run came against [[Eastern Washington Eagles football|Eastern Washington]] on September 6, 2008. Colorado won that game 31-24. Ralphie V is by far the fastest and largest of all the previous Ralphies.\n\nRalphie V has now reached maturity, weighing approximately 1,200 pounds and standing about 5 feet tall at her hump. Her growing has stopped, but not her speed or strength. She currently completes her run around Folsom Field, nearly two football fields in length, in less than 25 seconds.\n\nAt the end of the 2008 season, Priola retired from the program, and John Graves, a former Ralphie Handler, was brought on as the Assistant Director. In the summer of 2015 Graves was promoted to Program Manager, replacing Gail Pederson who retired after 20 years of helping the program. Graves now oversees the day-to-day activities of the program and the training of the Handlers and Ralphie. In the spring of 2016 Taylor Stratton, also a former Ralphie Handler, was brought on as the new Assistant Coach.\n[[File:CU Buffs Ralphie 2018.jpg|left|thumb|Ralphie V served 2008-19]]\nRalphie V was initially transported in the same custom steel, black stock trailer that carried Ralphie III and IV. In 2012 a new, highly customized aluminum stock trailer was purchased through donations made to the program, which is now used to transport Ralphie V. In 2016, a new black leather harness and headstall was used for Ralphie, built by Bill Jesser Saddlery out of Longmont, Colorado. The new harness kept the iconic brass \u201cCU\u201d located on the front of her headstall, and the leather color was switched from brown to black. The brass CU logo was made by Ray \u201cButch\u201d Cornell, the son of Ray Cornell who built the first Ralphie harness. The previous harness that she wore was also worn by Ralphie III and IV. Ralphie V wore the \u201cRalphie Blanket\u201d for her first two-season, but never liked to wear it and has not worn it since.\n\nRalphie V makes many appearances throughout the school year to support Colorado and the University. During football seasons, she attends the Ralphie's Corral pre-game party on campus. One hour before kickoff, Ralphie stands on the northeast sideline, ready to welcome the Buffs onto the field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cubuffs.com/sports/2016/6/16/ralphie-v.aspx|title=Ralphie V|website=University of Colorado Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\nRalphie V officially retired on November 12, 2019 after almost 12 seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cubuffs.com/news/2019/11/12/football-colorados-live-buffalo-mascot-ralphie-v-to-retire.aspx|title=Colorado's Live Buffalo Mascot, Ralphie V, To Retire|website=University of Colorado Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Due to temperament issues, she did not run the previous 2 home football games prior to her retirement.

For the final football game of the 1934 season, a group of students paid $25 to rent a buffalo calf to stand on the sidelines. Along with a real cowboy caretaker, it took four students to keep the calf, the son of \u201cKiller,\u201d a famed bison at Trails End Ranch in Fort Collins, calm on the sidelines. As far as luck though, Colorado won 7-0 against the [[University of Denver]] on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nPrior to 1934, CU athletic teams were referred to as Arapahoes, Big Horns, Frontiersmen, Grizzlies, Hornets, Silver and Gold, Silver Helmets, and Yellow Jackets. The student newspaper decided to sponsor a national contest in the summer of 1934, with a $5 prize to go to the author of the winning selection. Over 1,000 entries arrived from almost every state. Athletic Director Harry Carlson, Graduate Manager Walter Franklin, and Kenneth Bundy of the Silver and Gold were the judges.\n\nLocal articles first reported that Claude Bates of New Madrid, Missouri, and James Proffitt of Cincinnati, Ohio, were co-winners for the prize as both submitted \u201cBuffaloes\u201d as their entry. However, a few days later, the newspaper declared Boulder resident A.J. \u201cAndy\u201d Dickson the winner, after a follow-up investigation revealed his submission of \u201cBuffaloes\u201d had actually arrived several days before those of the original winners. Through the years, synonyms which quickly came into use included Bisons, Buffs, Golden Avalanche, Golden Buffaloes, Stampeding Herd, and Thundering Herd.\n\nLive buffaloes made appearances at Colorado games on and off throughout the early years, usually in a pen on the field or sometimes driven around in a trailer. In the 1940s, the school kept a baby buffalo in a special pen at the University Riding Academy. The first named buffalo was \"Mr. Chips,\" who appeared for the first time at the 1957 CU Days Kickoff Rally and was cared for by a men's honorary society.\n\nIn 1966 the Student Body Government decided that the University of Colorado Boulder needed a full-time live buffalo mascot. Freshman Class Officer Bill Lowery talked to his father who purchased and donated the original \"Ralphie\" to Colorado in March 1966. The Student Body Government planned for it to be the job of the Sophomore Class Officer's to take Ralphie to all home football games.\"\n\nThere are a couple versions of the story on how Ralphie became the name of our beloved mascot. One story says the Student Body Government held a \"Name the Buffalo\" contest and received many entries. One entry was for \"Ralph,\" in honor of the Junior Class president at the time, Ralph Jay Wallace. Another story says that \"Ralph\" was chosen as her name by the Student Body Government in reference to the noise made when throwing up. What is known for sure is that the original spelling of her name was \"Rraalph\" but was changed to \"Ralphie\" at the end of the 1967 football season.\n\nRalphie first appeared on the sidelines of a football game on October 1, 1966. Colorado beat [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] 10-0. Around that same time, head football coach [[Eddie Crowder]] was approached with the idea of the buffalo charging out on the field before the game, the team closely following. After much discussion, the debut of this great tradition took place on September 16, 1967. Colorado beat [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]] 27-7. Ever since then Ralphie has been leading the way as the football team takes the field.\n\nAfter the 1967 football season, the Student Body Government realized it was not smart to have it be the tradition for the Sophomore Class Officers to run with Ralphie, and instead it would be better to have trained individuals with large animal experience take the tradition over.\n\nThe Ralphie Live Mascot Program has since evolved, becoming a prestigious athletic endeavor for 15 student athletes and buffalo enthusiasts. It is currently under the direction of Program Manager and Coach John Graves and Assistant Coach Taylor Stratton, both were Handlers when they were students at Colorado.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cubuffs.com/sports/2016/6/28/ralphie-history.aspx|title=Ralphie History|website=University of Colorado Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Ralphie I===\n[[Image:Colorado Ralphie I.jpg|thumb|right|Ralphie I served 1966\u201378]]<!-- Fair use image, see image description page for fair use rationale -->\nIn March 1966, John Lowery, the father of a Colorado freshman from Lubbock, Texas, purchased a six- month old buffalo calf from [[Sedgwick, Colorado|Sedgewick, Colorado]] for $150 and donated her to the University. Lowery bought the calf from rancher Art Kashcke. Bill Lowery (John's son), John McGill, Don Marturano, and Vic Reinking were the original Ralphie Handlers who trained Ralphie I.\n\nRalphie first attended a game on October 1, 1966 when Colorado played [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]]. Ralphie did not run onto the field during the game, but stood on the sideline and slept in her trailer. Colorado won the game 10-0. She attended the remaining three home football games that year, standing on the sidelines.\n\nAround that same time, head football coach [[Eddie Crowder]] was approached with the idea of the buffalo charging out onto the field before the game, the team closely following. After much discussion, the debut of this great tradition took place on September 16, 1967, when Colorado played [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]]. Colorado beat Baylor 27-7. Ever since then Ralphie has been leading the way as the football team takes the field. Ralphie's first bowl game was the Bluebonnet Bowl on December 23, 1967, where Colorado beat [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] (FL) 31-21. The five sophomores that \u2018handled\u2019 her appointed themselves as the board of directors of a fundraising effort to bring Ralphie to Houston. By selling \u201cBuffalo Stock,\u201d they raised the necessary funds to send Ralphie to Houston, and help cover other costs associated with the program.\n\nIn 1976, the President of The Bank of Boulder, Steve Bosley, proposed to Crowder they would do a fundraiser to send Ralphie to the Orange Bowl game against [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]]. When a reporter asked Bosley how Ralphie would travel to Miami, he explained that the information was top secret since Colorado was concerned that Ohio State students would try to kidnap, or \u201cbuffalo-nap\u201d Ralphie. The story of the potential \u201cbuffalo-napping\u201d made newspapers nationwide, featuring a picture of Ralphie in full charge with her Handlers. The story stimulated over $25,000 in donations. Ralphie's trip to the Orange Bowl cost $2,500, and the balance was put into a fund for Ralphie's future care.\n\nRalphie I attended every Colorado home football game for 13 years, including all bowl games, and retired at the end of the 1978 season. The team matured too, selecting and training knowledgeable Handlers. The Handlers wore classic western attire while working with Ralphie, and initially would wear their cowboy boots when running with Ralphie. In 1978 the Handlers began to wear athletic shoes when running with Ralphie instead of cowboy boots, finding that it was easier to run faster and guide Ralphie while in athletic shoes.\n\nColorado's first Ralphie achieved national celebrity status, and was even kidnapped in 1970 by some Air Force Academy cadets, as well as being named Colorado's 1971 Homecoming Queen at the height of the anti-establishment era. In 1968, Ralphie also ran for Student Body President with the slogan of \u201cWhat\u2019s It To You?\u201d She did not win the election.\n\nDuring the football season Ralphie lived at the Green Meadows Riding Stable, located near present-day East Campus of the University, owned by C.D. \u201cBuddy\u201d Hays. Hays not only cared for and trained Ralphie, he was also the coach of the Colorado Rodeo Club. The Ralphie Handlers would also practice and work with Ralphie in the arena of Green Meadows Riding Stable. In the off-season Ralphie lived on the pastures at Hidden Valley Ranch, where Hays also kept his herd of buffalo, located north of Boulder. Ralphie I lived at Hidden Valley Ranch until 1981 when she moved to the McKenzie Ranch located in North Boulder. Ralphie traveled in a modified steel, brown, 4-horse trailer, donated by Hays. She used a custom harness and headstall made by Ray Cornell out of Boulder, Colorado that lead ropes were attached to allow the Handlers to run with her and help guide her around the field.\n\nRalphie I also had four calves, the sire of the calves was a large bull at Hidden Valley Ranch named Barney. In May 1971, Ralphie's first calf unfortunately died during a strong snowstorm. In April 27, 1972, Buffie, named by Colorado students, was born, but died from pneumonia on October 18, 1972. She made one public appearance on October 14, 1972 at the Colorado Homecoming game against [[Iowa State Cyclones football|Iowa State]], standing on the sidelines. On April 16, 1974, her third calf, Streaker, was born, but died from an accident on the ranch in October 1974. Her fourth and final calf was Spirit who was born in August 1975. Ralphie I's fourth calf, Spirit made her public debut at the 1975 homecoming parade. She ran during the second half run of the CU vs. [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]] game behind Ralphie I. CU beat Missouri 31-20. She was sold to a local rancher shortly after, not having the correct disposition to become the next Ralphie. Ralphie I's final game was the first half run on November 18, 1978 against Iowa State. Colorado lost 16-20 to Iowa State. Ralphie I died on May 13, 1982, she was 16 years old.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cubuffs.com/sports/2016/6/15/ralphie-i.aspx|title=Ralphie I|website=University of Colorado Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Ralphie II===\n[[Image:Colorado Ralphie II.jpg|thumb|left|Ralphie II served 1978\u201387]]<!-- Fair use image, see image description page for fair use rationale -->\nIn 1978, when Ralphie I became ill, Steve Bosley organized a search for a new buffalo headed by Buddy Hays. Hays discovered a yearling buffalo named Moonshine, owned by Gregg C. Mackenzie. Bosley, The Bank of Boulder, and Bank Director Robert Confer bought Moonshine from Mackenzie for $1,000 and donated her to Colorado. Since \u201cRalphie\u201d had become the well-known name of the buffalo, Athletic Director [[Eddie Crowder]] made it permanent.\n\nRalphie II was originally named Moon as she was born during a lunar eclipse. Her mother unfortunately died during labor, and she was raised by ranch hands on the Broken Spear Ranch. In 1976, Mackenzie purchased Moon from Ron Gregory, owner of Broken Spear Ranch, and raised her for his FFA project at Smoky Hill High School in [[Aurora, Colorado]]. Her name changed to Moonshine as a more fitting name for a female buffalo.\n\nMackenzie continued to train Ralphie II and was an assistant coach when Buddy Hays left in 1979, until 1983. Jim Wright, who was a former Handler, took charge over coaching duties from 1979 \u2013 1987. In 1985, Ken Kramer, a Handler from 1980 \u2013 1983, took over the leadership of the program until 1988 after serving as an assistant coach in 1984. Ralphie II lived at Hidden Valley Ranch until 1981, when she moved to the McKenzie Ranch located in North Boulder. Ralphie II moved to several different ranches after living a few years at the McKenzie ranch, ending up at B-J Acres, north of Erie, Colorado in 1985. In 1985 Johnnie Parker took over the program and the training of Ralphie II as well as housed her at the Parker Ranch in Hudson, Colorado.\n\nRalphie II made her debut on November 18, 1978, the final home game of the season. Standing on the sideline as Ralphie I made her final run around the field for the first half run, Ralphie II took over for the second half run. Colorado lost 16-20 to Iowa State, but the Ralphie Program and name became a tradition. In 1979, Ralphie took a trip to [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado]] for the NCAA Skiing Championships to support the school's ski team, which [[Colorado Buffaloes ski team|Colorado]] won. In 1985, Colorado selected the homecoming theme of \u201cRalphie goes to Hollywood.\u201d In 1986, Ralphie made the trip to Oklahoma State University (OSU) and ran at the Colorado vs. [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]] game and stayed at OSU's veterinary clinic. Students from OSU broke into the clinic that night and spray painted \u201cOSU\u201d in orange letters on her side.\n\nRalphie II was transported around in the same modified steel, brown, 4-horse trailer that Ralphie I used. Initially Ralphie II used the same custom leather harness that Ralphie I used, but used a different headstall. The harness was modified to fit Ralphie II's bigger size than Ralphie I's. In 1986 a new harness and headstall was used by Ralphie, this one was built by Carl W. Pike Saddlery out of Boulder, Colorado, the same company who modified the original harness to fit Ralphie II. The new headstall featured the iconic brass \u201cCU\u201d emblem on the front. While always a part of the Athletic Department, it was not until 1987 when Ralphie Handlers first earned a Varsity Letter for their participation.\n\nRalphie II was also named an honorary member of the Colorado Wildlife Foundation in 1979. In the fall of 1986 Ralphie II was confirmed to be pregnant, but the calf died during the pregnancy. She was expected to retire at the end of the 1987 season. However, at the age of 12, and after serving the Buffs for 10 years, Ralphie II died on September 19, 1987, following a 31-17 Colorado win over [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]]. Ralphie II was buried in [[Hudson, Colorado]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cubuffs.com/sports/2016/6/16/Ralphie-II.aspx|title=Ralphie II|website=University of Colorado Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>{{-}}\n\n===Ralphie III===\n[[Image:Colorado Ralphie III.gif|thumb|right|Ralphie III served 1987\u201397]]<!-- Fair use image, see image description page for fair use rationale -->\nOn June 3, 1985, Chuck Brackenbury was out mending fences on the Joe Miller Ranch outside of [[Laramie, Wyoming]], when he noticed a buffalo giving birth early in the morning. He checked back later that night and discovered the mom had died during labor, but the calf was still alive just standing there all alone. He brought the calf back to his ranch where she was bottle-fed and raised with horses and a goat. She was originally given the name of Buffy. Brackenbury eventually sold her to Bob Renaud, a buffalo rancher in [[Hudson, Colorado]]. In September 1987, Johnnie and Shaaron Parker bought the 2-year old buffalo from Renaud and donated her to the University. Parker also trained and housed her. Ralphie III was a lot bigger and faster than her two predecessors, and was given the name Tequila because of her fiery personality.\n\nRalphie III was brought into action earlier than anticipated, making her debut run on November 7, 1987 at a home game against [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]]. She did attend the two home games after Ralphie II died, but did not run, instead standing on the sidelines. Ralphie III was being trained for the 1988 season, as Ralphie II was to retire following the 1987 season. When Ralphie II died earlier than anticipated, and after only five weeks of training, Ralphie III finished the 1987 season. The Buffs welcomed her with a 27-10 victory over Missouri. On August 26, 1990, Ralphie III traveled to Anaheim, California when Colorado took on [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] in the Pigskin Classic. Though she was in attendance, she did not run onto the field since stadium officials did not allowing it. The game ended in a tie, 31-31.\n\nOn October 22, 1988 when Colorado played [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], Ralphie III and a second buffalo named Vicky, led the football team onto the field to start the game. Vicky used Ralphie II's old harness for the run, but did not run at the start of the second half. Vicky was born in May 1988 in Wyoming. Though she was originally dubbed Ralphie IV, Vicky did not have the temperament to be the next Ralphie and was subsequently sold to buffalo rancher a short time later. CU lost to Oklahoma 14-17.\n\nIn 1991, Ted Davis joined the program as a coach. In 1994, Gail Pederson began helping with the Ralphie Program behind the scenes, overseeing all the logistics, scheduling, and planning for the program. Ralphie III was initially transported in the same modified steel, brown, 4-horse trailer that carried Ralphie I and II, but in 1992, a new custom steel, black stock trailer was purchased for Ralphie through a donation from [[Coors Brewing Company]]. Initially she used the same harness and headstall that was used by Ralphie II. In 1989 a new harness and headstall was used, again with a large brass \u201cCU\u201d on the front. The new harness and headstall was built by M. King Saddlery out of Boulder, Colorado.\n\nRalphie III was the first Ralphie to wear the \u201cRalphie Blanket.\u201d The blanket is a custom-made banner blanket that reads \"Go Buffaloes\" on one side, and \"Beat [the opposing team]\" on the other side, such as \"Beat CSU.\" Shaaron Parker maintained the blanket and updated the opposing team's name each week.\n\nRalphie III led the Buffaloes on the field in 73 games, including 62 times in Boulder, eight bowl games, two times in Fort Collins, Colorado, and once in Stillwater, Oklahoma. After 11 years of service, she died on January 20, 1998, at the age of 12. Her final game was against [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] on November 28, 1997. Colorado lost 24-27.\n\nAfter Ralphie's death, the Colorado State Senate passed State Resolution 98\u201310 by Senator Elsie Lacy, a tribute to Ralphie III, the University of Colorado buffalo mascot, stating: \"That the University of Colorado and fans alike have lost a most beloved mascot and are saddened by the occasion of Ralphie III's death.\" Ralphie III was buried in [[Hudson, Colorado]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cubuffs.com/sports/2016/6/16/Ralphie-III.aspx|title=Ralphie III|website=University of Colorado Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Ralphie IV===\n[[File:Colorado Ralphie IV secret location.jpg|thumb|left|Joshua Lawton, photographer for the ''Boulder Daily Camera'', gets a rare look at the secret home of Ralphie IV as her handlers prepare her before the Montana State game in 2006.]]<!-- Fair use image, see image description page for fair use rationale --><!-- Fair use image, see image description page for fair use rationale -->\nRalphie IV was born in April 1997 on the Flying D Ranch in [[Gallatin Gateway, Montana]], owned by [[Ted Turner]], who donated her to the University of Colorado. While out checking the herd, Todd Traucht the buffalo manager at Flying D, found a newborn abandoned buffalo with her mother nowhere to be found. After checking out the baby buffalo, he found bite marks around her neck from a coyote attack. Being an abandoned buffalo and just surviving a coyote attack, Traucht took her home to be bottle fed and raised by him and his wife Susie. Traucht named her Rowdy due to her excitable nature. She was released back to the herd, but would not bond with them. She was then donated to Colorado as a yearling in April 1998. Johnnie Parker, who trained and housed both Ralphie II and III, brought her back to Colorado from Montana and supervised her early training.\n\nParker retired from the program in May 1999, after 13 years of working with the program, and housing and training Ralphie II, III, and IV. Longtime Colorado supporters Dale and Lynn Johnson housed Ralphie for the following year and coach Ted Davis assumed the program duties for the 2000 season. In the summer of 2001, two former Ralphie Handlers and Colorado graduates, Benny Frei and Kevin Priola, took over the program including the housing of Ralphie IV. Ralphie IV was transported in the same custom steel, black stock trailer that carried Ralphie III. She also used the same harness and headstall that was used by Ralphie III. Ralphie IV also continued to wear the \u201cRalphie Blanket,\u201d being maintained by Priola's wife, Michelle, who also updated the opposing team's name each week.\n\nRalphie IV weighed about 1,100 pounds, over three times her weight when she made her debut against [[Colorado State Rams football|Colorado State University]] at [[Mile High Stadium]] in [[Denver]] on September 5, 1998. Colorado won 42-14. Her final game was also against Colorado State University on August 31, 2008. Colorado won that game 38-17. Ralphie IV retired after 10 years of service and lived out her retirement in Henderson, Colorado. She ran at all four Big-12 Conference Championship games that Colorado played in, and traveled to six bowl games. She also made a historic trip to Atlanta, Georgia in 2006 when Colorado played the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|University of Georgia]]. In total, she ran at 75 football games during her career. She died on March 19, 2017, due to liver failure. She would have turned 20 years old the next month, a long life for a buffalo. Ralphie IV was buried in [[Henderson, Colorado]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cubuffs.com/sports/2016/6/16/ralphie-iv.aspx|title=Ralphie IV|website=University of Colorado Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Ralphie V===\n[[Image:RalphieV.jpg|thumb|right|Ralphie V at her public introduction on November 17, 2007. She was 13 months old and weighed 450 lbs.]]\n\nRalphie V was born in October 2006 on the Vermejo Park Ranch located in [[Cimarron, New Mexico]], owned by [[Ted Turner]]. Like Ralphie IV, Ted Turner donated Ralphie V to the University. As the darkest calf in the herd, she was named \"Blackout\" by ranch hands. Ralphie Program Directors Benny Frei and Kevin Priola worked with Barney Coppedge, the Bison Manager at Vermejo Park Ranch, to bring Ralphie V to Colorado. Frei continues to house Ralphie V.\n\nRalphie V came to Colorado in January 2007, and was introduced at \"Ralphie\u2019s Salute to a New Era\" on November 17, 2007. A little over one-year-old, she weighed in at 450 pounds. Her debut game run came against [[Eastern Washington Eagles football|Eastern Washington]] on September 6, 2008. Colorado won that game 31-24. Ralphie V is by far the fastest and largest of all the previous Ralphies.\n\nRalphie V has now reached maturity, weighing approximately 1,200 pounds and standing about 5 feet tall at her hump. Her growing has stopped, but not her speed or strength. She currently completes her run around Folsom Field, nearly two football fields in length, in less than 25 seconds.\n\nAt the end of the 2008 season, Priola retired from the program, and John Graves, a former Ralphie Handler, was brought on as the Assistant Director. In the summer of 2015 Graves was promoted to Program Manager, replacing Gail Pederson who retired after 20 years of helping the program. Graves now oversees the day-to-day activities of the program and the training of the Handlers and Ralphie. In the spring of 2016 Taylor Stratton, also a former Ralphie Handler, was brought on as the new Assistant Coach.\n[[File:CU Buffs Ralphie 2018.jpg|left|thumb|Ralphie V served 2008-19]]\nRalphie V was initially transported in the same custom steel, black stock trailer that carried Ralphie III and IV. In 2012 a new, highly customized aluminum stock trailer was purchased through donations made to the program, which is now used to transport Ralphie V. In 2016, a new black leather harness and headstall was used for Ralphie, built by Bill Jesser Saddlery out of Longmont, Colorado. The new harness kept the iconic brass \u201cCU\u201d located on the front of her headstall, and the leather color was switched from brown to black. The brass CU logo was made by Ray \u201cButch\u201d Cornell, the son of Ray Cornell who built the first Ralphie harness. The previous harness that she wore was also worn by Ralphie III and IV. Ralphie V wore the \u201cRalphie Blanket\u201d for her first two-season, but never liked to wear it and has not worn it since.\n\nRalphie V makes many appearances throughout the school year to support Colorado and the University. During football seasons, she attends the Ralphie's Corral pre-game party on campus. One hour before kickoff, Ralphie stands on the northeast sideline, ready to welcome the Buffs onto the field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cubuffs.com/sports/2016/6/16/ralphie-v.aspx|title=Ralphie V|website=University of Colorado Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\nRalphie V officially retired on November 12, 2019 after almost 12 seasons<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cubuffs.com/news/2019/11/12/football-colorados-live-buffalo-mascot-ralphie-v-to-retire.aspx|title=Colorado's Live Buffalo Mascot, Ralphie V, To Retire|website=University of Colorado Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. Due to temperament issues, she did not run the previous 2 home football games prior to her retirement. The search for the next mascot, to be named Ralphie VI, was said to be \u201congoing\u201d as of November 2019.\n\n==Traditions==\n[[Image:RalphieVisitsSanford.jpg|thumb|right|Ralphie IV in her pen at the Georgia game on September 23, [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006]].

It is a variant of the [[Ragdoll]] cat and was established as a separate breed in 1994.

The fur should be to medium to medium long. Texture is to be, soft, dense and silky.<ref>www.ragamuffinfanciers.com</ref> Short hair on the body or tail, making it appear to be a short haired cat is a disqualification. Every color and pattern is allowable, with or without white. <ref><www.ragamuffinfanciers.com </ref> Their eyes can be any solid color, with some exhibiting heterochromia.\n\n== History ==\nThe IRCA Cherubim Cats developed from 1971-1994 (23 years) were used as the foundation cats for the RagaMuffin Breed and included the IRCA Miracle Ragdolls, Ragdolls, Honey Bears, and Maxamillion lines.\n\nIn contrast, their cousin the Ragdoll Breed was founded with only the IRCA Ragdoll lines developed from 1971-1975 (4 years).\n\nCurrently, acceptable outcrossings are as follows: \nACFA (Siberian),\nCFA (Long Haired Selkirk Rex, Straight),\nGCCF (British Longhair).\n\n=== Ragdoll background ===\n{{Main|Ragdoll cat}}\nIn the 1960s, a regular, non-[[Pedigree (animal)|pedigreed]], white, [[domestic long-haired]] cat named Josephine (of unknown [[Angora cat|Angora]] or Persian stock), who had produced several litters of typical kittens, eventually produced a litter of unusually docile kittens. When the subsequent litter produced more of the same, Ann Baker (an established cat breeder) purchased several kittens from the owner and set out to create what is now known as the Ragdoll.  The sires were of unrecorded [[Birman (cat)|Birman]] or [[Burmese (cat)|Burmese]] ancestry.\n\nIn 1975, after a group of IRCA Ragdoll breeders left, Baker decided to spurn traditional cat breeding associations. She trademarked the name \"Ragdoll\" and \u201cCherubim\u201d and set up her own registry, [[International Ragdoll Cat Association]] (IRCA). Baker imposed stringent standards on anyone who wanted to breed or sell cats under that name. The IRCA Ragdolls were also not allowed to be registered in other breed associations.\n\n=== Breed divergence ===\nIn 1994, a group of IRCA breeders decided to leave and form their own group because of the increasing restrictions. Owing to Baker's trademark on the name ''Ragdoll'' and \u2018\u2019Cherubim\u2019\u2019, the group renamed its stock of IRCA Cherubim Cats ''Ragamuffins''. While the originally proposed name was ''Liebling'', the name ''RagaMuffin'' was put forth as an alternative by Curt Gehm, one of the group's founders, and it was chosen. \n\nIn the spirit of bettering the breed's genetic health, personality, and temperament, the group selectively allowed a limited amount of outcross to Domestic Longhair cats that appeared to already fit the Standard of Perfection established in ACFA. Later, once the Domestic Longhair Cat allowance expired, outcrosses allowed historically include Persians. The group also allowed some limited outcrossing to IRCA Ragdolls initially (ended in 2010 for ACFA-recognized Ragamuffins). Only cats with at least one RagaMuffin parent and an accepted outcross in ACFA/CFA/GCCF currently qualify to be called Authentic RagaMuffins.  [[Cat Fanciers' Association]], [[American Cat Fanciers Association]], [[Governing Counsel of the Cat Fancy]]\n\nThe first cat association to accept the breed at full show champion status was the United Feline Organization (UFO), and shortly that same year it was accepted into the [[American Cat Fanciers Association]] (ACFA). Finally, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) accepted them into the Miscellaneous class in February, 2003 and advanced them to Championship class in February, 2011.\n\nThe most obvious difference between typical RagaMuffins and Ragdolls is the required [[point coloration]] in Ragdolls, where as the RagaMuffin is allowed any color and pattern.  The Standard of Perfection describes the RagaMuffin as requiring a \u2018Sweet\u2019 overall expression with large, rounded with pinch at the corner Walnut Shaped Eyes versus the Ragdoll's thinner, slightly angled Almond Shaped eyes. Adding to the sweet expression, RagaMuffins have rounded contours between the ears and a nose scoop versus the Ragdoll which calls for flat planes. RagaMuffins call for a flatter topline and Ragdolls call for a more angular topline with the raised hind quarter. RagaMuffin coats are to be Plush in texture and the Ragdoll allows for both Silky or Plush coats.\n\n==Color forms==\nRagamuffins come in all patterns and colors, although [[Point (coat color)#Point coloration in cats|colorpoints]] are permitted to be registered and bred they are not allowed to be shown in CFA.<ref>[http://www.cfa.org/breeds/standards/ragamuffin.html Breed Standard: Ragamuffin] Cat Fanciers Association {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051208075251/http://www.cfa.org/breeds/standards/ragamuffin.html |date=2005-12-08 }}</ref> Their eyes can be any solid color, with some exhibiting [[heterochromia]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ragamuffins}}\n{{Wiktionary|Ragamuffin}}\n* [http://www.floppycats.com/ Ragdolls (floppy cats) information]\n* [http://ragamuffingroup.com/ RagaMuffin Associated Group] The original breed club begun by those who founded the Ragamuffin breed\n* [http://www.ragamuffinkittens.org/ The RagaMuffin Kitten Breeders Society] A group of RagaMuffin breeders and Ragamuffin lovers dedicated to raising authentic Ragamuffins while adhering to a code of ethics with respect to best breeding practices.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101124180413/http://www.iams.com/cat-breeds/ragamuffin_cats.aspx Breed profile] at IAMS cat breed guide\n*[http://www.cfainc.org/Breeds/BreedsKthruR/Ragamuffin.aspx CFA Ragamuffin Breed Profile]\n*[http://www.catster.com/cat-breeds/Ragamuffin Catster Ragamuffin Article]\n* [[www,ragamuffinfanciers.com|RagaMuffin Cat Fanciers]] https://ragamuffinfanciers.com/<nowiki/>CFA club for exhibitors, breeders and fanciers\n{{Domestic cat}}\n\n[[Category:Cat breeds]]\n[[Category:Cat breeds originating in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Ragamuffin (disambiguation){{!}}Ragamuffin}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{COI|date=June 2019}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|date=June 2019}}\n{{original research|date=June 2019}}\n}}\n{{more footnotes|date=August 2014}}\n{{Infobox Catbreed  \n| name          = Ragamuffin\n| image         = 20050922AmarilloRes.jpg\n| imagecaption  = \n| altname       =    \n| nickname      =    \n| country       = [[United States]]\n| cfastd        = http://www.cfainc.org/Portals/0/documents/breeds/standards/ragamuffin.pdf\n| fifestd       =\n| ticastd       = \n| gccfstd       = \n| aacestd       = \n| acfastd       = http://www.acfacats.com/ragamuffin_standard.htm\n| acfstd        = \n| ccastd        = \n| otherstd      = \n| notrecognized =\n| extinct       =\n| note          = \n|}}\n\nThe '''Ragamuffin''' is a breed of [[domestic cat]].

When the wheel was turned, the person was stretched in a manner similar to the rack. The ''Austrian Ladder'' was basically a more vertically oriented rack. As part of the torture, victims would usually be burned under the arms with candles.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Strappado]]\n*[[Breaking on the Wheel]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Commons category|Rack (torture)}}\n*Monestier, M.

It is Portugal's first channel, and was launched in 1957. For a brief period it was known and marketed as '''Canal 1''' (Channel 1); it has long been commonly called this. It is one of the most watched television networks in the country. The channel became a 24-hour service in 2002, although it now leases its [[graveyard slot]] (3:56&nbsp;am to 5:59&nbsp;am) to the infomercial producer and direct-response marketer, A Loja Em Casa (in turn owned by [[El Corte Ingl\u00e9s]]). Until that point, RTP1 closed down with [[A Portuguesa|the national anthem]], but this practice stopped not too long before infomercials filled the overnight slots.\n\nRTP1 has a variety of programs, composed mainly of news and talk-shows, sports, current affairs, national and international fiction, such as films and TV series. Unlike sister channel [[RTP2]], RTP1 broadcasts commercial advertising, which, along with the licence fee, finances the channel.\n\n==History==\nRTP was established in December 1955 with test broadcasts conducted in September 1956 at the now-defunct Feira Popular amusement park in Lisbon.\nRegular broadcasts commenced at 21:30 on 7 March 1957. Initially the channel broadcast from 21:30 to either 23:00 or 23:30, with an additional period on Sundays between 18:00 and 19:00.\n\nInitially, RTP had a limited coverage area, using 5 transmitters (Monsanto, Montejunto, Lous\u00e3, Monte da Virgem and Foia) that covered about 60% of the country's population.<ref>https://cdn-images.rtp.pt//icm/arquivo/docs/d3/d39fad04a851f431fe13a31171b5a26c_5ee889d2e005733027e53d663dacbb8f.pdf</ref>\n\nIt then expanded to the whole of the mainland in the mid-1960s.\nOn 18 October 1959, ''[[Telejornal (Portugal)|Telejornal]]'' went on air for the first time, becoming the longest-running Portuguese TV show to end.\n\nIt was the only TV channel available in Portugal until 25 December 1968, when [[RTP2]] started broadcasting. Because of that, RTP had to identify both channels as '''I Programa''' and '''II Programa''' in order to distinguish them.\n\nDaytime broadcasts commenced in 1970, with a two-hour period running at various times mostly between 12:30 and 14:30. Before then, Telescola (educational classes) were generally the first programmes of the day and the regular schedule started at 19:00, running until midnight.\n\nIn 1974, RTP's ratings grew with the expansion of the acquisition of television sets in the country. The first colour broadcasts were conducted in 1976, with the legislative elections.\n\nOn 16 October 1978, the channel was renamed '''RTP-1''' (initially hyphenated). Colour programming was now in production, and a heat of [[Jeux Sans Fronti\u00e8res]] has to be transmitted in said technology in order to air to the rest of Europe, which already had regular colour broadcasts at the time. As the months progressed, more and more colour broadcasts were included before launching regularly on 7 March 1980.\n\nIn October 1983, the daytime period was abolished in order to save energy. Weekday broadcasts were then restricted to start at 17:00 and end at 23:00. Said broadcasts were resumed in 1985, when RTP decided to broadcast the daytime block from Oporto. The educational broadcasts (then known as Ciclo Preparat\u00f3rio TV) were abolished in 1988. By then, daytime shutdowns were abolished.\n\nTowards the end of the 1980s, RTP was facing challenges with the impending arrival of private broadcasters. As a result, RTP decided to rename RTP1 as '''RTP Canal 1''', in readiness for a bigger rebrand that happened on 17 September 1990, where the channel was now officially rebranded as '''Canal 1''', in order to reinforce its position in front of the new broadcasters. Having lost its leadership status slowly between 1994 and 1995, owing to SIC's success, it eventually turned into the vice-leader before falling into third place, when TVI got a ratings boost.\n\nOn 29 April 1996, Canal 1 reverted to '''RTP1'''.\n\nIn 2002, Em\u00eddio Rangel joined RTP1, coming from SIC, changing the face of public television in Portugal but causing havoc on the broadcaster. During this phase, the channel had overly-long news bulletins (i.e. RTP at 8 ending as late as 21:30) and thought-provoking debate shows (Gregos e Troianos).\n\nOn 31 March 2004, RTP1 rebranded entirely now broadcasting from RTP's new headquarters.\n\nThe channel started widescreen tests on 8 June 2012 with the Euro 2012 opening ceremony and the first match (Poland vs. Greece). On 14 January 2013, the channel formally became a widescreen channel.\n\n==Logos and identities==\n\n=== 1957-1959 ===\n[[File:RTP 1957.png|thumb|The First Logo of RTP.]]\n=== 1959-1978 ===\n[[File: RTP 1959.png|When RTP got a new corporate logo in 1959, RTP1 took the opportunity to adopt a new logo that consists of RTP's corporate logo as well as the '''I Programa''' wordmark are appearing at the bottom of the corporate logo, although RTP's corporate logo were used on RTP's TV channels without any indication of being either the first or the second channel that has begun service from 1968.]]\n\n\n=== 1978-1980 ===\n<gallery>\nFile:RTP1 1978.png|RTP1's third logo used from 16 October 1978 to March 1980.\n</gallery>From 1978 to 1990, RTP1 and RTP2 began their trial period of changing so many logos in 10 various ways within 12 years.

Eventually, this new logo comes up with an ident that features the 1-numeral as a circle, while the shapes are flying to form the 1-numeral, especially that the '''RTP''' wordmark are appearing from the logo.\n\n=== 1988-1990 ===\nOn 2 December 1988, RTP1 gets another more new logo which gets changed into a green 1-numeral that is inside a blue square that contains a picture which can be seen here although it comes from a transitory phase from RTP1's 1990 identity.

From 12 October 1998, RTP1 refreshed its 1996 identity by debuting a new ident collection that is designed by Novocom, but the same time had also happened for its sister channel, RTP2, so these new idents were featuring some several motifs such as eyes, or Christmas ornaments during the Holiday season, and they were lasting for two years until October 2000, when a new ident package gets implemented onto the screen, and though they were featuring a single ident that is designed by BBC Broadcast, but later in September 2001, it had another new single ident, and besides, this ident package were short-lived until 2002.\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"100\" bordersize=\"none\" bordercolor=\"transparent\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nFile:RTP1 1996.png|First phase of RTP1's fourteenth and old logo used until 11 October 1998.\n</gallery>\n\n=== 2002-2004 ===\n<gallery>\nFile:RTP1 logo 2002.png|RTP1's fifteenth and former logo used from 28 January 2002 to 30 March 2004.\n</gallery>\nOn 28 January 2002, RTP1 introduced a new logo that is changed again, and with that, it creates a new ident package that will feature every ident where the logo gets formed from snow, fire, sand and water, but this ident package had lasted a short use until early 2003, when it gets replaced by a single ident that features the logo on a light blue background.\n\n=== 2004-2016 ===\n<gallery>\nFile:RTP1.PNG|RTP1's sixteenth and previous logo used from 31 March 2004 to 28 March 2016.\n</gallery>\nRTP1 got another new logo on 31 March 2004, following its rebrand, but it had only used one ident at any period of time instead of having a collection of idents (just like its sister channel RTP2, for example). According to RTP, the channel adopted its first ident package for its 2004 identity, and it consists of a single ident that is RTP's corporate logo which is moving around a dark blue background that will at a given time \"sit\" at the proper background, and by 2007, following RTP's television department's 50th anniversary celebration, a new ident package were introduced though it gets changed to a single ident that features some few RTP-styled ribbons which will then give place to RTP1's logo, but from 7 January 2009, the channel were again renewing its 2004 identity for the third time, and it were eventually renewing its on-screen design that will be the first true ident package since 2003, and it is composed with a variety of short animated films that is reproduced inside RTP's symbol on a black or a white background, but they were lasting within two years until 2011, when they gets replaced by another new ident package which features idents with RTP's logo being formed by blocks side by side, while they showcase some several elements of a specific year season, so however, on 8 January 2013, they were later replaced by the final ident package of RTP1's 2004 identity when RTP1 refreshed its ident package, although it maintains its logo, but especially when this new ident package are featuring Portuguese locales and youth, if they're repositioning RTP1 as a channel for Portuguese-produced content, featuring new [[infotainment]] and documentary shows, as well as brand new sitcoms and drama shows, well even though this new ident package are also including a full conversion to the 16:9 aspect ratio (just like its sister channel, RTP2), as opposed to the [[4:3]], which was widely used until 29 March 2016.\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"100\" bordersize=\"none\" bordercolor=\"transparent\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nFile:RTP1.png|Alternate version of RTP1's sixteenth and previous logo.\n</gallery>\n\n=== 2016-present ===\n<gallery>\nFile:RTP1 2016.png|RTP1's seventeenth and current logo since 29 March 2016.\n</gallery>\nAs part of RTP's global rebranding on 29 March 2016, RTP1 got a new logo that is revised for the first time of 12 years since 2004, and so, this new logo will make the inner part of the ribbons become rectangles without rounded corners, while the '''RTP''' wordmark is having more straight angles as well as the 1-numeral will now be written in the Calibre Bold font, and eventually, the channel adopts some various idents that are made by invited Portuguese graphic artists, such as Vhils in 2016, and Jo\u00e3o Paulo Feliciano in 2017, when RTP1 adopts some new minimalist graphics that is using light blue as its accent color and the promotion-endboards will have a white version of the new logo on a blue background, but the on-screen DOG will also become static.\n\n==Programs==\n\n===News===\n* Manchetes 3\n* Bom Dia Portugal\n* Jornal da Trade\n* Portugal em Direto\n* Edi\u00e7\u00e3o Especial (only on special occasions)\n* Telejornal\n* Sexta \u00e0s 9\n* Pr\u00f3s e Contras\n\n===Variety shows===\n* Pra\u00e7a da Alegria \u2013 a daily variety talk-show broadcast on weekdays between 10 a.m. and 1&nbsp;pm.

It is Portugal's first channel, and was launched in 1957. For a brief period it was known and marketed as '''Canal 1''' (Channel 1); it has long been commonly called this. It is one of the most watched television networks in the country. The channel became a 24-hour service in 2002, although it now leases its [[graveyard slot]] (3:56&nbsp;am to 5:59&nbsp;am) to the infomercial producer and direct-response marketer, A Loja Em Casa (in turn owned by [[El Corte Ingl\u00e9s]]). Until that point, RTP1 closed down with [[A Portuguesa|the national anthem]], but this practice stopped not too long before infomercials filled the overnight slots.\n\nRTP1 has a variety of programs, composed mainly of news and talk-shows, sports, current affairs, national and international fiction, such as films and TV series. Unlike sister channel [[RTP2]], RTP1 broadcasts commercial advertising, which, along with the licence fee, finances the channel.\n\n==History==\nRTP was established in December 1955 with test broadcasts conducted in September 1956 at the now-defunct Feira Popular amusement park in Lisbon.\nRegular broadcasts commenced at 21:30 on 7 March 1957. Initially the channel broadcast from 21:30 to either 23:00 or 23:30, with an additional period on Sundays between 18:00 and 19:00.\n\nInitially, RTP had a limited coverage area, using 5 transmitters (Monsanto, Montejunto, Lous\u00e3, Monte da Virgem and Foia) that covered about 60% of the country's population<ref>https://cdn-images.rtp.pt//icm/arquivo/docs/d3/d39fad04a851f431fe13a31171b5a26c_5ee889d2e005733027e53d663dacbb8f.pdf</ref>.\n\nIt then expanded to the whole of the mainland in the mid-1960s.\nOn 18 October 1959, ''[[Telejornal (Portugal)|Telejornal]]'' went on air for the first time, becoming the longest-running Portuguese TV show to end.\n\nIt was the only TV channel available in Portugal until 25 December 1968, when [[RTP2]] started broadcasting. Because of that, RTP had to identify both channels as '''I Programa''' and '''II Programa''' in order to distinguish them.\n\nDaytime broadcasts commenced in 1970, with a two-hour period running at various times mostly between 12:30 and 14:30. Before then, Telescola (educational classes) were generally the first programmes of the day and the regular schedule started at 19:00, running until midnight.\n\nIn 1974, RTP's ratings grew with the expansion of the acquisition of television sets in the country. The first colour broadcasts were conducted in 1976, with the legislative elections.\n\nOn 16 October 1978, the channel was renamed '''RTP-1''' (initially hyphenated). Colour programming was now in production, and a heat of [[Jeux Sans Fronti\u00e8res]] has to be transmitted in said technology in order to air to the rest of Europe, which already had regular colour broadcasts at the time. As the months progressed, more and more colour broadcasts were included before launching regularly on 7 March 1980.\n\nIn October 1983, the daytime period was abolished in order to save energy. Weekday broadcasts were then restricted to start at 17:00 and end at 23:00. Said broadcasts were resumed in 1985, when RTP decided to broadcast the daytime block from Oporto. The educational broadcasts (then known as Ciclo Preparat\u00f3rio TV) were abolished in 1988. By then, daytime shutdowns were abolished.\n\nTowards the end of the 1980s, RTP was facing challenges with the impending arrival of private broadcasters. As a result, RTP decided to rename RTP1 as '''RTP Canal 1''', in readiness for a bigger rebrand that happened on 17 September 1990, where the channel was now officially rebranded as '''Canal 1''', in order to reinforce its position in front of the new broadcasters. Having lost its leadership status slowly between 1994 and 1995, owing to SIC's success, it eventually turned into the vice-leader before falling into third place, when TVI got a ratings boost.\n\nOn 29 April 1996, Canal 1 reverted to '''RTP1'''.\n\nIn 2002, Em\u00eddio Rangel joined RTP1, coming from SIC, changing the face of public television in Portugal but causing havoc on the broadcaster. During this phase, the channel had overly-long news bulletins (i.e. RTP at 8 ending as late as 21:30) and thought-provoking debate shows (Gregos e Troianos).\n\nOn 31 March 2004, RTP1 rebranded entirely now broadcasting from RTP's new headquarters.\n\nThe channel started widescreen tests on 8 June 2012 with the Euro 2012 opening ceremony and the first match (Poland vs. Greece). On 14 January 2013, the channel formally became a widescreen channel.\n\n==Logos and identities==\n\n=== 1957-1959 ===\n[[File:RTP 1957.png|thumb|The First Logo of RTP.]]\n=== 1959-1978 ===\n[[File: RTP 1959.png|When RTP got a new corporate logo in 1959, RTP1 took the opportunity to adopt a new logo that consists of RTP's corporate logo as well as the '''I Programa''' wordmark are appearing at the bottom of the corporate logo, although RTP's corporate logo were used on RTP's TV channels without any indication of being either the first or the second channel that has begun service from 1968.]]\n\n\n=== 1978-1980 ===\n<gallery>\nFile:RTP1 1978.png|RTP1's third logo used from 16 October 1978 to March 1980.\n</gallery>From 1978 to 1990, RTP1 and RTP2 began their trial period of changing so many logos in 10 various ways within 12 years.

From 12 October 1998, RTP1 refreshed its 1996 identity by debuting a new ident collection that is designed by Novocom, but the same time had also happened for its sister channel, RTP2, so these new idents were featuring some several motifs such as eyes, or Christmas ornaments during the Holiday season, and they were lasting for two years until October 2000, when a new ident package gets implemented onto the screen, and though they were featuring a single ident that is designed by BBC Broadcast, but later in September 2001, it had another new single ident, and besides, this ident package were short-lived until 2002.\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"100\" bordersize=\"none\" bordercolor=\"transparent\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nFile:RTP1 1996.png|First phase of RTP1's fourteenth and old logo used until 11 October 1998.\n</gallery>\n\n=== 2002-2004 ===\n<gallery>\nFile:RTP1 logo 2002.png|RTP1's fifteenth and former logo used from 28 January 2002 to 30 March 2004.\n</gallery>\nOn 28 January 2002, RTP1 introduced a new logo that is changed again, and with that, it creates a new ident package that will feature every ident where the logo gets formed from snow, fire, sand and water, but this ident package had lasted a short use until early 2003, when it gets replaced by a single ident that features the logo on a light blue background.\n\n=== 2004-2016 ===\n<gallery>\nFile:RTP1.PNG|RTP1's sixteenth and previous logo used from 31 March 2004 to 28 March 2016.\n</gallery>\nRTP1 got another new logo on 31 March 2004, following its rebrand, but it had only used one ident at any period of time instead of having a collection of idents (just like its sister channel RTP2, for example). According to RTP, the channel adopted its first ident package for its 2004 identity, and it consists of a single ident that is RTP's corporate logo which is moving around a dark blue background that will at a given time \"sit\" at the proper background, and by 2007, following RTP's television department's 50th anniversary celebration, a new ident package were introduced though it gets changed to a single ident that features some few RTP-styled ribbons which will then give place to RTP1's logo, but from 7 January 2009, the channel were again renewing its 2004 identity for the third time, and it were eventually renewing its on-screen design that will be the first true ident package since 2003, and it is composed with a variety of short animated films that is reproduced inside RTP's symbol on a black or a white background, but they were lasting within two years until 2011, when they gets replaced by another new ident package which features idents with RTP's logo being formed by blocks side by side, while they showcase some several elements of a specific year season, so however, on 8 January 2013, they were later replaced by the final ident package of RTP1's 2004 identity when RTP1 refreshed its ident package, although it maintains its logo, but especially when this new ident package are featuring Portuguese locales and youth, if they're repositioning RTP1 as a channel for Portuguese-produced content, featuring new [[infotainment]] and documentary shows, as well as brand new sitcoms and drama shows, well even though this new ident package are also including a full conversion to the 16:9 aspect ratio (just like its sister channel, RTP2), as opposed to the [[4:3]], which was widely used until 29 March 2016.\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" widths=\"100\" bordersize=\"none\" bordercolor=\"transparent\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nFile:RTP1.png|Alternate version of RTP1's sixteenth and previous logo.\n</gallery>\n\n=== 2016-present ===\n<gallery>\nFile:RTP1 2016.png|RTP1's seventeenth and current logo since 29 March 2016.\n</gallery>\nAs part of RTP's global rebranding on 29 March 2016, RTP1 got a new logo that is revised for the first time of 12 years since 2004, and so, this new logo will make the inner part of the ribbons become rectangles without rounded corners, while the '''RTP''' wordmark is having more straight angles as well as the 1-numeral will now be written in the Calibre Bold font, and eventually, the channel adopts some various idents that are made by invited Portuguese graphic artists, such as Vhils in 2016, and Jo\u00e3o Paulo Feliciano in 2017, when RTP1 adopts some new minimalist graphics that is using light blue as its accent color and the promotion-endboards will have a white version of the new logo on a blue background, but the on-screen DOG will also become static.\n\n==Programs==\n\n===News===\n* Manchetes 3\n* Bom Dia Portugal\n* Jornal da Trade\n* Portugal em Direto\n* Edi\u00e7\u00e3o Especial (only on special occasions)\n* Telejornal\n* Sexta \u00e0s 9\n* Pr\u00f3s e Contras\n\n===Variety shows===\n* Pra\u00e7a da Alegria \u2013 a daily variety talk-show broadcast on weekdays between 10 a.m. and 1&nbsp;pm.
