Historians often refer to the Kingdom of Israel as the '''\"Northern Kingdom\"''' or as the '''\"Kingdom of Samaria\"''' to differentiate it from the Southern [[Kingdom of Judah]].\n\nSome researchers in modern scholarship, incorporating [[textual criticism]] and [[Biblical archaeology|archaeology]], have challenged the biblical account that the northern kingdom of Israel broke off from a united monarchy with the southern kingdom of Judah, suggesting instead that the northern Kingdom of Israel developed independently of Judah (a comparatively small and rural area), and that it first reached the political, economic, military and architectural sophistication of a kingdom under the [[Omrides|Omride dynasty]] around 884 BCE.<ref name=fink>Finkelstein, Israel; Silberman, Neil Asher (2002) ''The Bible Unearthed : Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts'', Simon & Schuster, {{ISBN|0-684-86912-8}}</ref>{{rp|169\u2013195}}<ref name=Kuhrtp438>\n{{cite book |last= Kuhrt |first= Amiele |title= The Ancient Near East |year= 1995 |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 978-0-41516-762-8 |page= [https://archive.org/details/ancientneareastc00akuh/page/438 438] |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/ancientneareastc00akuh/page/438 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/2014/07/wri388001.shtml|title=The Bible and Interpretation - David, King of Judah (Not Israel)|website=www.bibleinterp.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingdom of Israel existed roughly from 930 BCE until 720 BCE, when it was conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. The major cities of the kingdom were [[Shechem]], [[Tirzah (ancient city)|Tirzah]], [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria (Shomron)]], [[Jaffa]], [[Bethel]] and [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]].\n\n==Biblical narrative==\nIn the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Kingdom of Israel has been referred to as the \"[[House of Joseph]]\".<ref name=\"Zechariah 10:6\">*[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah%2010:6;&version=49; Zechariah 10:6]</ref><ref name=\"2Samuel 2:10\">*[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=10&chapter=2&verse=10&version=31&context=verse II Samuel 2:10]</ref> It is also frequently referenced (particularly in poetry) as [[Ephraim and Judah|Ephraim]], the tribe whose territory housed the capital cities and the royal families.

Its capital was [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] according to the [[Book of Isaiah]]. <!-- [http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/History/Kings.html] [http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/History/Judah.html] -->\n\n==Biblical background==\n===United Monarchy===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)}}\nThe [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Kingdom of Israel and Judah]] is said to have existed from about 1030 to about 930 BCE. It was a union of all the twelve [[Israelite]] tribes living in the area that presently approximates [[modern Israel]] and the other Levantine territories including much of western Jordan, and western Syria.\n\n===Division===\n{{main|Jeroboam's Revolt}}\nAfter the death of [[Solomon]] in about 931 BCE, most of the Israelite tribes (ten Northern tribes) except for [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] and [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] refused to accept [[Rehoboam]], the son and successor of Solomon, as their king.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:17-22|NIV}}</ref> The rebellion against Rehoboam arose after he refused to lighten the burden of [[tax]]ation and services that his father had imposed on his subjects.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:4|NIV}}, {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:14|NIV}}</ref>\n\n[[Jeroboam]], who was not of the [[Davidic line]], was sent forth from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] by the malcontents.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:2-3|NIV}}</ref> The [[Tribe of Ephraim]] and all Israel raised the old cry, \"Every man to his tents, O Israel\".<ref>{{Bibleverse||2Samuel|20:1|NIV}}</ref> Rehoboam fled to Jerusalem,<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:1-18|NIV}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|10|NIV}}</ref> and in 930 BCE (some date it in 920 BCE), Jeroboam was proclaimed king over all Israel at [[Shechem]]. After the revolt at [[Shechem]] at first only the [[tribe of Judah]] remained loyal to the [[Davidic line|house of David]]. But very soon after the [[tribe of Benjamin]] joined Judah. The northern kingdom continued to be called the Kingdom of Israel or Israel, while the southern kingdom was called the [[Kingdom of Judah]]. {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|15:9|NIV}} also says that members of the tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] and [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] fled to Judah during the reign of [[Asa of Judah]].\n\n==History==\n{{See|History of ancient Israel and Judah}}\n\n===Early kings and Omride dynasty===\n[[File:Jehu-Obelisk-cropped.jpg|thumb|The tribute of Northern Kingdom King \"[[Jehu]] of the people of the land of [[Omri]]\" ({{lang-akk|\ud808\udd40\ud808\udf11\ud808\udc00 \ud808\ude25 \ud808\udd37\ud808\udf1d\ud808\ude91\ud808\udd3f}}) as depicted on the [[Black Obelisk]] of [[Shalmaneser III]], 841-840 BCE.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kuan |first1=Jeffrey Kah-Jin |title=Neo-Assyrian Historical Inscriptions and Syria-Palestine: Israelite/Judean-Tyrian-Damascene Political and Commercial Relations in the Ninth-Eighth Centuries BCE |date=2016 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |isbn=978-1-4982-8143-0 |pages=64-66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMOqCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA65 |language=en}}</ref> This is \"the only portrayal we have in ancient Near Eastern art of an Israelite or Judaean monarch\".<ref name=\"AD\">{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Ada |last2=Kangas |first2=Steven E. |title=Assyrian Reliefs from the Palace of Ashurnasirpal II: A Cultural Biography |date=2010 |publisher=UPNE |isbn=978-1-58465-817-7 |page=127 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRKU0YXBWtgC&pg=PA127 |language=en}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Black Obelisk side 4 Jewish delegation.jpg|thumb|Part of the gift-bearing Jewish delegation of King Jehu, [[Black Obelisk]], 841-840 BCE.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Delitzsch |first1=Friedrich |last2=McCormack |first2=Joseph |last3=Carruth |first3=William Herbert |last4=Robinson |first4=Lydia Gillingham |title=Babel and Bible; |date=1906 |publisher=Chicago, The Open court publishing company |page=78 |url=https://archive.org/stream/babelbibl00deli/babelbibl00deli#page/78/mode/1up}}</ref>]]\n[[Shechem]] was the first capital of the Kingdom of Israel.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:25|NIV}}</ref> Afterwards it was [[Tirzah (ancient city)|Tirzah]].<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|14:17|NIV}}</ref> King [[Omri]] built his capital in [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] (1 Kings 16:24), which continued as such until the destruction of the Kingdom by the [[Assyria]]ns ({{Bibleverse|2|Kings|17:5|NIV}}).\n\nToday, among archaeologists, Samaria is one of the most universally accepted archaeological sites from the biblical period<ref>See Yohanan Aharoni, et al.

For the following eighty years, there was no open war between them, and, for the most part, they were in friendly alliance, co-operating against their common enemies, especially against [[Damascus]].\n\nThe conflict between Israel and Judah was resolved when [[Jehoshaphat]], King of Judah, allied himself with the house of [[Ahab]] through marriage. Later, Jehosophat's son and successor, [[Jehoram of Judah]], married Ahab's daughter [[Athaliah]], cementing the alliance. However, the sons of Ahab were slaughtered by [[Jehu]] following his [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] around 840 BCE.\n\n[[File:Black Obelisk, Jewish delegation to Shalmaneser III.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3|[[Jehu]]'s delegation to [[Shalmaneser III]], [[Black Obelisk]], 841-840 BCE.]]\n\n===Destruction of the kingdom===\n{{main|Assyrian captivity}}\nIn c. 732 BCE, [[Pekah]] of Israel, while allied with [[Rezin]], king of [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]], threatened [[Jerusalem]].

People from these tribes including the Reubenite leader, were taken captive and resettled in the region of the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] system. Tiglath-Pilesar also captured the territory of [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]] and the city of [[Janohah|Janoah]] in [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and an Assyrian governor was placed over the region of Naphtali. According to {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|16:9|NIV}} and {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|15:29|NIV}}, the population of Aram and the annexed part of Israel was deported to Assyria.\n\n[[File:Deportation of Jews by Assyrians.svg|right|thumb|Deportation of the Northern Kingdom by the [[Assyrian Empire]]]]\nThe remainder of the northern kingdom of Israel continued to exist within the reduced territory as an independent kingdom until around 720 BCE, when it was again invaded by [[Assyria]] and the rest of the population deported. During the three-year siege of [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] in the territory of Ephraim by the Assyrians, [[Shalmaneser V]] died and was succeeded by [[Sargon II of Assyria|Sargon II]], who himself records the capture of that city thus: \"Samaria I looked at, I captured; 27,280 men who dwelt in it I carried away\" into Assyria. Thus, around 720 BCE, after two centuries, the kingdom of the ten tribes came to an end. Some of the Israelite captives were resettled in the Khabur region, and the rest in the land of the [[Medes]], thus establishing Hebrew communities in [[Ecbatana]] and [[Rages]]. The [[Book of Tobit]] additionally records that Sargon had taken other captives from the northern kingdom to the Assyrian capital of Nineveh, in particular Tobit from the town of Thisbe in Naphtali.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible relates that the population of the Kingdom of Israel was exiled, becoming known as the [[Ten Lost Tribes]]. To the south, the [[Tribe of Judah]], the [[Tribe of Simeon]] (that was \"absorbed\" into Judah), the [[Tribe of Benjamin]] and the people of the [[Tribe of Levi]], who lived among them of the original [[Israelites|Israelite]] nation, remained in the southern Kingdom of Judah. The Kingdom of Judah continued to exist as an independent state until 586 BCE, when it was conquered by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]].\n\n====Samaritan version====\nThe Samaritan version to the events claims that actually much of the population of the Northern Kingdom of Israel remained in place upon the Exile, including the Tribes of Naphtali, Menasseh, Benjamin and Levi - being the progenitors of the [[Samaritans]]. In their book ''[[The Bible Unearthed]]'', authors [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] estimate that only a fifth of the population (about 40,000) were actually resettled out of the area during the two deportation periods under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] and [[Sargon II]].<ref name=fink/>{{rp|221}} Many of the Northern Tribes also fled south to Jerusalem, which appears to have expanded in size five-fold during this period, requiring a new wall to be built, and a new source of water [[Siloam]] to be provided by King [[Hezekiah]].\n\n====Medieval Rabbinic fable====\nIn medieval Rabbinic fable, the concept of the ten tribes who were taken away from the House of David (who continued the rule of the southern kingdom of Judah), becomes confounded with accounts of the Assyrian deportations leading to the myth of the \"Ten Lost Tribes\".\n\n====Recorded history====\nThe recorded history differs from the Rabbinic fable: No record exists of the Assyrians having exiled people from [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]], [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]], [[Tribe of Issachar|Issachar]], [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]] or western Manasseh. Descriptions of the deportation of people from [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] in [[Gilead]], Ephraim and Naphtali indicate that only a portion of these tribes were deported and the places to which they were deported are known locations given in the accounts. The deported communities are mentioned as still existing at the time of the composition of the [[Books of Kings]] and [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]] and did not disappear by assimilation. {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|30:1-18|NIV}} explicitly mentions northern Israelites who had been spared by the Assyrians, in particular people of Ephraim, Manasseh, Asher, Issachar and Zebulun, and how members of the latter three returned to worship at the Temple in Jerusalem during the reign of [[Hezekiah]].\n\n==Royal houses==\n{{Further|Kings of Israel and Judah}}\n[[File:Genealogy of the kings of Israel and Judah.svg|thumb|550px|center|The genealogy of the kings of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judea, the Kingdom of Israel and the kings of the Kingdom of Judah.

Historians often refer to the Kingdom of Israel as the '''\"Northern Kingdom\"''' or as the '''\"Kingdom of Samaria\"''' to differentiate it from the Southern [[Kingdom of Judah]].\n\nSome researchers in modern scholarship, incorporating [[textual criticism]] and [[Biblical archaeology|archaeology]], have challenged the biblical account that the northern kingdom of Israel broke off from a united monarchy with the southern kingdom of Judah, suggesting instead that the northern Kingdom of Israel developed independently of Judah (a comparatively small and rural area), and that it first reached the political, economic, military and architectural sophistication of a kingdom under the [[Omrides|Omride dynasty]] around 884 BCE.<ref name=fink>Finkelstein, Israel; Silberman, Neil Asher (2002) ''The Bible Unearthed : Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts'', Simon & Schuster, {{ISBN|0-684-86912-8}}</ref>{{rp|169\u2013195}}<ref name=Kuhrtp438>\n{{cite book |last= Kuhrt |first= Amiele |title= The Ancient Near East |year= 1995 |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 978-0-41516-762-8 |page= [https://archive.org/details/ancientneareastc00akuh/page/438 438] |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/ancientneareastc00akuh/page/438 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/2014/07/wri388001.shtml|title=The Bible and Interpretation - David, King of Judah (Not Israel)|website=www.bibleinterp.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingdom of Israel existed roughly from 930 BCE until 720 BCE, when it was conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].

It was a union of all the twelve [[Israelite]] tribes living in the area that presently approximates [[modern Israel]] and the other Levantine territories including much of western Jordan, and western Syria.\n\n===Division===\n{{main|Jeroboam's Revolt}}\nAfter the death of [[Solomon]] in about 931 BCE, most of the Israelite tribes (ten Northern tribes) except for [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] and [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] refused to accept [[Rehoboam]], the son and successor of Solomon, as their king.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:17-22|NIV}}</ref> The rebellion against Rehoboam arose after he refused to lighten the burden of [[tax]]ation and services that his father had imposed on his subjects.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:4|NIV}}, {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:14|NIV}}</ref>\n\n[[Jeroboam]], who was not of the [[Davidic line]], was sent forth from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] by the malcontents.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:2-3|NIV}}</ref> The [[Tribe of Ephraim]] and all Israel raised the old cry, \"Every man to his tents, O Israel\".<ref>{{Bibleverse||2Samuel|20:1|NIV}}</ref> Rehoboam fled to Jerusalem,<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:1-18|NIV}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|10|NIV}}</ref> and in 930 BCE (some date it in 920 BCE), Jeroboam was proclaimed king over all Israel at [[Shechem]]. After the revolt at [[Shechem]] at first only the [[tribe of Judah]] remained loyal to the [[Davidic line|house of David]]. But very soon after the [[tribe of Benjamin]] joined Judah. The northern kingdom continued to be called the Kingdom of Israel or Israel, while the southern kingdom was called the [[Kingdom of Judah]]. {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|15:9|NIV}} also says that members of the tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] and [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] fled to Judah during the reign of [[Asa of Judah]].\n\n==History==\n{{See|History of ancient Israel and Judah}}\n\n===Early kings and Omride dynasty===\n[[File:Jehu-Obelisk-cropped.jpg|thumb|The tribute of Northern Kingdom King \"[[Jehu]] of the people of the land of [[Omri]]\" ({{lang-akk|\ud808\udd40\ud808\udf11\ud808\udc00 \ud808\ude25 \ud808\udd37\ud808\udf1d\ud808\ude91\ud808\udd3f}}) as depicted on the [[Black Obelisk]] of [[Shalmaneser III]], 841-840 BCE.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kuan |first1=Jeffrey Kah-Jin |title=Neo-Assyrian Historical Inscriptions and Syria-Palestine: Israelite/Judean-Tyrian-Damascene Political and Commercial Relations in the Ninth-Eighth Centuries BCE |date=2016 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |isbn=978-1-4982-8143-0 |pages=64-66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMOqCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA65 |language=en}}</ref> This is \"the only portrayal we have in ancient Near Eastern art of an Israelite or Judaean monarch\".<ref name=\"AD\">{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Ada |last2=Kangas |first2=Steven E. |title=Assyrian Reliefs from the Palace of Ashurnasirpal II: A Cultural Biography |date=2010 |publisher=UPNE |isbn=978-1-58465-817-7 |page=127 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRKU0YXBWtgC&pg=PA127 |language=en}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Black Obelisk side 4 Jewish delegation.jpg|thumb|Part of the gift-bearing Jewish delegation of King Jehu, [[Black Obelisk]], 841-840 BCE.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Delitzsch |first1=Friedrich |last2=McCormack |first2=Joseph |last3=Carruth |first3=William Herbert |last4=Robinson |first4=Lydia Gillingham |title=Babel and Bible; |date=1906 |publisher=Chicago, The Open court publishing company |page=78 |url=https://archive.org/stream/babelbibl00deli/babelbibl00deli#page/78/mode/1up}}</ref>]]\n[[Shechem]] was the first capital of the Kingdom of Israel.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:25|NIV}}</ref> Afterwards it was [[Tirzah (ancient city)|Tirzah]].<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|14:17|NIV}}</ref> King [[Omri]] built his capital in [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] (1 Kings 16:24), which continued as such until the destruction of the Kingdom by the [[Assyria]]ns ({{Bibleverse|2|Kings|17:5|NIV}}).\n\nToday, among archaeologists, Samaria is one of the most universally accepted archaeological sites from the biblical period<ref>See Yohanan Aharoni, et al.

For the following eighty years, there was no open war between them, and, for the most part, they were in friendly alliance, co-operating against their common enemies, especially against [[Damascus]].\n\nThe conflict between Israel and Judah was resolved when [[Jehoshaphat]], King of Judah, allied himself with the house of [[Ahab]] through marriage. Later, Jehosophat's son and successor, [[Jehoram of Judah]], married Ahab's daughter [[Athaliah]], cementing the alliance. However, the sons of Ahab were slaughtered by [[Jehu]] following his [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] around 840 BCE.\n\n[[File:Black Obelisk, Jewish delegation to Shalmaneser III.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3|[[Jehu]]'s delegation to [[Shalmaneser III]], [[Black Obelisk]], 841-840 BCE.]]\n\n===Destruction of the kingdom===\n{{main|Assyrian captivity}}\nIn c. 732 BCE, [[Pekah]] of Israel, while allied with [[Rezin]], king of [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]], threatened [[Jerusalem]].

People from these tribes including the Reubenite leader, were taken captive and resettled in the region of the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] system. Tiglath-Pilesar also captured the territory of [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]] and the city of [[Janohah|Janoah]] in [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and an Assyrian governor was placed over the region of Naphtali. According to {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|16:9|NIV}} and {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|15:29|NIV}}, the population of Aram and the annexed part of Israel was deported to Assyria.\n\n[[File:Deportation of Jews by Assyrians.svg|right|thumb|Deportation of the Northern Kingdom by the [[Assyrian Empire]]]]\nThe remainder of the northern kingdom of Israel continued to exist within the reduced territory as an independent kingdom until around 720 BCE, when it was again invaded by [[Assyria]] and the rest of the population deported. During the three-year siege of [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] in the territory of Ephraim by the Assyrians, [[Shalmaneser V]] died and was succeeded by [[Sargon II of Assyria|Sargon II]], who himself records the capture of that city thus: \"Samaria I looked at, I captured; 27,280 men who dwelt in it I carried away\" into Assyria. Thus, around 720 BCE, after two centuries, the kingdom of the ten tribes came to an end. Some of the Israelite captives were resettled in the Khabur region, and the rest in the land of the [[Medes]], thus establishing Hebrew communities in [[Ecbatana]] and [[Rages]]. The [[Book of Tobit]] additionally records that Sargon had taken other captives from the northern kingdom to the Assyrian capital of Nineveh, in particular Tobit from the town of Thisbe in Naphtali.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible relates that the population of the Kingdom of Israel was exiled, becoming known as the [[Ten Lost Tribes]]. To the south, the [[Tribe of Judah]], the [[Tribe of Simeon]] (that was \"absorbed\" into Judah), the [[Tribe of Benjamin]] and the people of the [[Tribe of Levi]], who lived among them of the original [[Israelites|Israelite]] nation, remained in the southern Kingdom of Judah. The Kingdom of Judah continued to exist as an independent state until 586 BCE, when it was conquered by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]].\n\n====Samaritan version====\nThe Samaritan version to the events claims that actually much of the population of the Northern Kingdom of Israel remained in place upon the Exile, including the Tribes of Naphtali, Menasseh, Benjamin and Levi - being the progenitors of the [[Samaritans]]. In their book ''[[The Bible Unearthed]]'', authors [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] estimate that only a fifth of the population (about 40,000) were actually resettled out of the area during the two deportation periods under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] and [[Sargon II]].<ref name=fink/>{{rp|221}} Many of the Northern Tribes also fled south to Jerusalem, which appears to have expanded in size five-fold during this period, requiring a new wall to be built, and a new source of water [[Siloam]] to be provided by King [[Hezekiah]].\n\n====Medieval Rabbinic fable====\nIn medieval Rabbinic fable, the concept of the ten tribes who were taken away from the House of David (who continued the rule of the southern kingdom of Judah), becomes confounded with accounts of the Assyrian deportations leading to the myth of the \"Ten Lost Tribes\".\n\n====Recorded history====\nThe recorded history differs from the Rabbinic fable: No record exists of the Assyrians having exiled people from [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]], [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]], [[Tribe of Issachar|Issachar]], [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]] or western Manasseh. Descriptions of the deportation of people from [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] in [[Gilead]], Ephraim and Naphtali indicate that only a portion of these tribes were deported and the places to which they were deported are known locations given in the accounts. The deported communities are mentioned as still existing at the time of the composition of the [[Books of Kings]] and [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]] and did not disappear by assimilation. {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|30:1-18|NIV}} explicitly mentions northern Israelites who had been spared by the Assyrians, in particular people of Ephraim, Manasseh, Asher, Issachar and Zebulun, and how members of the latter three returned to worship at the Temple in Jerusalem during the reign of [[Hezekiah]].\n\n==Royal houses==\n{{Further|Kings of Israel and Judah}}\n[[File:Genealogy of the kings of Israel and Judah.svg|thumb|550px|center|The genealogy of the kings of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judea, the Kingdom of Israel and the kings of the Kingdom of Judah.

As [[Doo-wop]] became popular on the streets of New York and across the nation in the early 1960s, Conti organized a group of street singers and performed in subways and neighborhood hallways. \"I grew up in Brooklyn where there was an A Capella group on every corner. Singing Doo Wop was what I did almost every night \u2013 in the subway, at school, after school and wherever there was an echo.\"<ref>[http://bobconti.com/625-2/ ]{{dead link|date=December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://daeida.com/DAEIDA_00_2015_Digital_Edition_2013-04.html|title=Daeida Magazine: Hollywood's People, Passions and Its Past|first=David St.|last=Mark|website=daeida.com}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 14, his family moved to [[Los Angeles]] where during the summer months he learned to play the saxophone, and by his second year at [[Venice High School (Los Angeles)|Venice High School]] Conti played Baritone Sax in the award-winning high school dance band, \"The Crescendos\".

Donna Summer went on to become the number one act in the world. Through his association with Donna, Conti met famed producers [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Pete Bellotte]]. After hearing Conti's percussion work (live and in the studio), Conti was asked to play on the soon to be double platinum ''[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer album)|Bad Girls]]'' album. He composed a song with Donna Summer on that album: \"Can't Get To Sleep at Night\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://letrasbd.com/donna-summer/cant-get-to-sleep-at-night/|title=Letra de Can't Get To Sleep At Night - Donna Summer - Lyrics|publisher=|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Updike|first=John|title=Rabbit Is Rich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G030_fzwrTkC&pg=PP6|year=2010|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-74409-8|page=6}}</ref> Conti wrote another song with Donna and keyboardist Virgil Weber for an album that was to be recorded at her first [[Hollywood Bowl]] performance, \"Only One Man\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donnasummer.it/questiontimebobconti.html|title=Bob Conti Question Time|first=Sebastiano|last=Lionti|website=www.donnasummer.it}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daeida.com/DAEIDA_00_BI_2013_04.html|title=Daeida Magazine: Hollywood's People, Passions and Its Past|first=David St.|last=Mark|website=www.daeida.com}}</ref> which was chosen to be the flip side of \"[[Heaven Knows (Donna Summer song)|Heaven Knows]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uhini.com/Flipside.htm|title=Flipside Top 100|publisher=|accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref> a duet sung by Donna and [[Joe \"Bean\" Esposito]] on the ''[[Live and More]]'' album.

Other coronaviruses have been shown to be able to infect the brain via a synaptic route to the [[respiratory centre]] in the [[medulla]], through [[mechanoreceptors]] and [[chemoreceptors]] within the lungs. It is possible that dysfunction within the respiratory centre further exarcebates the ARDS seen in COVID-19 patients.

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
