Olsen's relationship with Kierkegaard exerted a crucial influence over his intellectual development, philosophy and theology, and the legacy of their engagement figures prominently in his writings with all of his works except one dedicated to her and crediting her as a reason as to why he became a writer.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early Years and Engagement To Kierkegaard===\n{{Infobox philosopher\n| name = S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\n| birth_name = S\u00f8ren Aabye Kierkegaard\n| image = S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813-1855) - (cropped).jpg\n| alt = A head-and-shoulders portrait sketch of a young man in his twenties that emphasizes his face, full hair, open and forward-looking eyes and a hint of a smile.

Olsen later recalled that upon this first meeting Kierkegaard had made \"a very strong impression\" upon her and a friend recalled Olsen being enraptured by the words and way in which Kierkegaard spoke. <ref name=\"impression\">''Encounters'', p. 34</ref><ref name=\"penguin classics\">{{cite book |last=Hannay |first=Alastair |date=March 7, 1996 |title=Papers and Journals: A Selection |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=61 |isbn=9780140445893}}</ref> A mutual infatuation developed between the two while Olsen was being tutored by [[Johan Frederik Schlegel]], her future husband.\n\nOlsen had also made a strong impression on Kierkegaard, who began to pursue her over a long period of time, ingratiating himself first as a friend and later attempting to court her.  On September 8, 1840, Kierkegaard finally revealed his feelings to Olsen when she was playing the piano for him at her family's house.  He recounted the events years later in his journal: \"'Oh!  What do I care for music, it's you I want, I have wanted you for two years.'  She kept silent.\"  Kierkegaard proceeded to plead his case to Etatsraad (Councilman) Olsen, Olsen's father, immediately.  Her father granted Kierkegaard his blessing, and the two became engaged to be married.<ref name=\"Journals\">An edited account of Kierkegaard's relation to Olsen and her family, from the point of view of Kierkegaard, appears roughly around August 1849 in Journals, 49 X 5 A 149</ref> Until the eventual dissolution of their engagement, they lived quite happily as Kierkegaard used Olsen as a sort of [[confidant]]. Each week, for instance, she would listen to Kierkegaard reading aloud to her a sermon from Bishop Mynster of Copenhagen.<ref name=\"KIERKEGAARD THE CELIBATE\"/>\n\nAlmost immediately, however, Kierkegaard began to have doubts about his ability to be a husband.  Throughout the following year, Kierkegaard threw himself into his work.  He began his [[seminarian]] studies, preached his first [[sermon]], and wrote his [[dissertation]] for his [[Magister (degree)|magister degree]].  Olsen sensed that Kierkegaard's ostensibly busy schedule was a pretence for avoiding her, an action which pained Kierkegaard deeply to do.<ref name=\"KIERKEGAARD THE CELIBATE\"/> They did maintain a voluminous correspondence; for a time he wrote her cryptic letters every Wednesday. Kierkegaard's letters have survived, but, aside from a few lines, Olsen's letters seem to have been destroyed.<ref name=\"Reglet\">In an interview in 1896, Olsen claims to have burned her letters to Kierkegaard, when she accepted the portion of Kierkegaard's inheritance relating to her.  See ''Encounters, p. 38''.</ref>  \n\nKierkegaard's letters were very reminiscent of Abelard's letter to Philintus where Abelard wrote: {{Quotation|Fulbert surprised me with Heloise, but what man that had a soul in him would not have borne any ignominy on the same conditions? The next day I provided myself with a private lodging near the loved house, being resolved not to abandon my prey. I abode some time without appearing publicly. Ah! how long did those few days seem to me! When we fall from a state of happiness with what impatience do we bear our misfortunes! It being impossible that I could live without seeing Heloise, I endeavoured to engage her servant, whose name was Agaton, in my interest. She was brown, well-shaped, and a person superior to her rank; her features were regular and her eyes sparkling, fit to raise love in any man whose heart was not prepossessed by another passion. I met her alone and entreated her to have pity on a distressed lover.

He had to sacrifice the very best thing he owned in order to work as God demanded of him: therefore he sacrificed love \u2026 for the sake of his writing. <ref name=\"KIERKEGAARD THE CELIBATE\"/>}}\n\nKierkegaard seems to have genuinely loved Olsen but was unable to reconcile the prospect of marriage with his vocation as a writer, his passionate, introspective Christianity and his constant melancholy.  Olsen was shattered by his rejection of her, and was unwilling to accept Kierkegaard's breaking of their engagement, threatening to kill herself if he did not take her back.<ref name=Tudvad39>Tudvad, ''Kierkegaards K\u00f8benhavn'', p. 39.</ref> Kierkegaard attempted to quell her interest, he later wrote, \"there was nothing else for me to do but to venture to the uttermost, to support her, if possible, by means of deception, to do everything to repel her from me to rekindle her pride.\"<ref name=\"Journals1\">Again in Journals, slight difference in translation, 49&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;5 A 149.</ref> He wrote her cold, calculated letters to make it seem that he didn't love her anymore, but Olsen clung to the hope that they would get back together, desperately pleading to him to take her back.  On October 11, 1841, Kierkegaard met with her and again broke off the engagement in person.  Her father tried to persuade him to reconsider after assessing Olsen's desperate condition, claiming that \"It will be the death of her; she is in total despair\"<ref name=\"Journals1\" /> Kierkegaard returned the next day and spoke with Olsen. To her query as to whether he would ever marry, Kierkegaard icily responded: \"Well, yes, in ten years, when I have begun to simmer down and I need a lusty young miss to rejuvenate me.\"<ref name=\"Journals1\" />  In reality, Kierkegaard had no such plans, and would remain a celibate bachelor for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"unsure\">There is really no way to know this for sure, but based on his journal entries, it seems highly likely.  \"I saw a pretty girl today \u2014 that does not interest me anymore... At the same time it is good for me; those little romances distracted me a good deal.\"; in Alexander Dru\u2019s translation of Journals, 41 III A 175.</ref> \n\nOlsen was crushed by the whole affair, soon falling ill as a result. <ref name=\"KIERKEGAARD THE CELIBATE\"/> Olsen was equally \"in despair, utterly desperate\" and angered, with Kierkegaard recalling how she \"took out a small note on which there was something written by me which she used to carry in her breast; she took it out and quietly tore it into small pieces and said: \u2018So after all, you have played a terrible game with me\".<ref name=\"NS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/2019/03/Kierkegaard-philosopher-of-the-heart-clare-carlisle-review|title=Kierkegaard\u2019s ways to be human|website=NewStatesman|last=Monk|first=Ray|date=March 27, 2019|accessdate=April 1, 2020}}</ref> Kierkegaard was equally distraught, being described as spending his nights crying in his bed without her.<ref name=\"Journals1\" />  The story of the engagement became a source of gossip in [[Copenhagen]], with Kierkegaard's flippant dismissal and apparently cruel [[seduction]] of Olsen becoming wildly exaggerated. Olsen's family reacted with a mixture of confusion, finding Kierkegaard's actions incomprehensible, to outright hatred for causing Olsen such pain although Olsen's sister Cornelia believed that despite not understanding Kierkegaard's actions she nevertheless believed him to be a good person.<ref name=\"Muse\"/>  Kierkegaard would later beg for Olsen to forgive him for his actions.  In a famous letter, he wrote, \"Above all, forget the one who writes this; forgive someone who, whatever else, could not make a girl happy.\"<ref name=\"Hannay\">Hannay's ''Kierkegaard'' p. 155</ref>\n\n====Kierkegaard's concern====\nKierkegaard was so concerned that Olsen might actually destroy herself because she said she couldn't live without him that he tried to give her advice in his [[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844|''Fourth Upbuilding Discourse of 1844'']]. He wanted her to be able to stand on her own with or without him. He asked her: {{Quotation|\"When the first self submits to the deeper self, they are reconciled and walk on together. ... Would you be better off now by having lost some of that burning desire and having won the understanding that life cannot deceive you; is not that kind of losing a winning? That little secret we two have between us, as the deeper self said. What, presumably, is this secret, my listener? What else but this, that with regard to the external a person is capable of nothing at all. If he wants to seize the external immediately, it can be changed in the same instant, and he can be deceived; on the other hand, he can take it with the consciousness that it could also be changed, and he is not deceived even though it is changed, because he has the deeper self's consent. If he wants to act immediately in the external, to accomplish something, everything can become nothing in that same moment; on the other hand, he can act with this consciousness, and even if it came to nothing, he is not deceived, because he has the deeper self's consent. But even if the first self and the deeper self have been reconciled in this way and the shared mind has been diverted away from the external, this is still only the condition of coming to know himself. But if he is actually to know himself, there are new struggles and new dangers.\" S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', 1844, Hong translation p. 316-317 (Four Upbuilding Discourses)}}\n\nKierkegaard mentioned the concern that awoke his conscience in this Upbuilding Discourses and came to the conclusion that the power of forgiveness is a good and perfect gift from God. (See: ''[[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]'', and: ''Love Will Hide a Multitude of Sins''<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20peter%204&version=ESV. See: 1 Peter 4:7\u201312, The Holy Bible].) Kierkegaard decided to forgive Olsen so that his love might hide her sin from the eyes of God just as Christ's love hides our sin from the eyes of God.</ref> (See: ''[[Three Upbuilding Discourses|Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]''.)\nHe wanted one thing from Regine that she would not give, [[forgiveness]]. If one can't forgive another how does one forgive himself or herself or expect forgiveness from God? He wrote the following in 1845: \n\n[[File:Kierkegaard 20090502-DSCF1492.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] by [[Louis Hasselriis]]]]\n<blockquote>\n\"That it [the broken engagement] can be forgiven, if not here then nevertheless in an eternity. Is there anything dubious about this forgiveness? Yes, there is \u2013 that I do not have her forgiveness; and she is and remains an intermediate court, a legitimate court, that must not be bypassed. Her forgiveness certainly cannot justify me eternally, no more than a person's implacability can harm anyone but himself, but her forgiveness is a part of a divine procedure. Why, then, do you not have it? Because I could not make myself understandable to her. ... Suppose she had forgiven me. Then, of course, she would not have forgotten me. But can we see each other then? Suppose she stood beside someone else. When she stands that way within time, I am standing in her path and therefore shall go away. But if I stood in her path in eternity, where should I go. Compared with eternity, is time the stronger? Has time the power to separate us eternally?\" S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, ''Stages on Life's Way'' (1845), Hong p. 380-382, 390\u2013391</blockquote><blockquote>What would indeed be as disconsolate, yes, almost to the point of despair, as this-if, at the moment when the misunderstanding one returned and sought understanding, when the unfriendly one returned and sought friendship, when the one who had hated returned and sought reconciliation-what would be as disconsolate as this: if the one who loves has then wasted away, so that neither understanding nor the restoration of friendship nor the renewal of reconciliation in love could really take place with the blessed joy of eternity! On the other hand, what can make  the moment of forgiveness, the transition of agreement so natural, so easy as this: that the one who loves by abiding, has continually cleared away the past. ''Works of Love'', 1847 Hong 1995 p. 313-314</blockquote><blockquote>\"You must have God\u2019s help to believe that you are saved by Baptism; you must have God\u2019s help to believe that in the Lord\u2019s Supper you receive the gracious forgiveness of your sins. Be it done for you as you believe.<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%208&version=ESV Matthew 8:5\u201313]</ref> But everything in you that is flesh and blood and is timorousness and attachment to things of this earth must despair, so that you cannot acquire external certainty. If this like for like holds true even in relation to what most definitely must be called Gospel, how much more, then, when Christianity is itself the Law. \"Forgive, then you will be forgiven\"  ''Works of Love'', Sep 29, 1847, Hong 378\u2013380<ref>Matthew 6:14\u201315 English Standard Version (ESV) ''For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.''</ref></blockquote>\n\nSometime after the dissolution of the engagement and Olsen's marriage, Kierkegaard considered writing to her in order to explain his behaviour but decided not to, beliving it would damage his relationship with God, which he saw as his first and foremost calling in life.<ref name=\"Jstor2\">{{Cite journal|last=Casey|first=Thomas|title=S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard's Uncertain Call to Celibacy|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23582364?readnow=1&refreqid=excelsior%3Ab65264992a3995cfd623975a047302dd&seq=8#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Gregorianum|volume=88|date=2007|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref> In 1849 Kierkegaard sent a letter to Olsen experessing his sorrow and pleading for forgiveness. {{Quotation|That I was cruel is true; that I, committed to a higher relationship, not simply for the sake of my virtue, had to be so because of love is a certainty; that you have suffered indescribably I realize; but I was to suffer more, I believe and know.\u2014Nevertheless, I am ready to ask your forgiveness\u2014provided you understand it as follows, provided you harbor no other explanation of our relationship than the fabrication, provided and forced upon you by my solicitude, that I was a black-hearted villain who broke a sacred obligation out of self-love, cruelly deceiving a lovely young girl who with all the righteousness of innocence on her side, with almost worshipful admiration and almost childlike devotion, entrusted herself to him. Provided you understand the matter in that way, then let me remain in the character of that pious deception: I am a villain, but now I come as a suffering penitent and beg forgiveness (Letter 235, p. 322f.) <ref name=\"SK\"/>}}\n\nOlsen outlived Kierkegaard by almost a half century; she died in March 1904 at the age of eighty-two. Johannes Hohlenberg preserved a letter she wrote to Henrik Lund, Kierkegaard's nephew, in which she said, \"His death filled me not only with sorrow but with concern, as though by postponing action I had committed a great injustice against him. \u2026. But since his death, it has seemed to me as if it were a duty I had neglected from cowardice; a duty not only towards him, but towards God, to whom he sacrificed me, whether he did it from an innate tendency to self-torment (a misgiving he himself had), or whether, as I think time and the results of his work will show, from a higher call from God.\"<ref>''S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, a Biography'' by Johannes Hohlenberg 1954 P. 230-231</ref>\n\n===Later Years and Marriage to Johan Frederik Schlegel===\n[[Image:Regine Olsen (1870).jpg|thumb|Regine Olsen, circa 1840s]]\n\nOn April 16, 1843, Kierkegaard was leaving Vor Frue Church when he saw Olsen who nodded to him which Kierkegaard understood to mean she had forgiven him. This was an important interaction for them which would signify Olsen moving on. Kierkegaard would later write in his journal:{{Quotation|At Vespers on Easter Sunday in Frue Kirke (during Mynster's sermon), she nodded to me. I do not know if it was pleadingly or forgivingly, but in any case very affectionately. I had sat down in a place apart, but she discovered it. Would to God that she had not done so. Now a year and a half of suffering and all the enormous pains I took are wasted; she does not believe that I was a deceiver, she has faith in me. What ordeals now lie ahead of her. The next will be that I am a hypocrite. The higher we go, the more dreadful it is. That a man of my inwardness, of my religiousness, could act in such a way. And yet I can no longer live solely for her, cannot expose myself to the contempt of men in order to lose my honor\u2014that I have done. Shall I in sheer madness go ahead and become a villain just to get her to believe it\u2014ah, what help is that. She will still believe that I was not that before (Journals, IV A 97). <ref name=\"SK2\"/>}}\n\nOn November 3, 1847, Olsen married her old tutor, [[Johan Frederik Schlegel]], in the [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]] in Copenhagen.<ref>Tudvad, ''Kierkegaards K\u00f8benhavn'', pp. 418\u20139.</ref> The marriage was happy and stable. The two even read aloud to each other passages from Kierkegaard's writings, which were then getting much attention in Denmark. On the day of her wedding, Kierkegaard wrote to her pleading for forgiveness.{{Quotation|Your are my sacrifice, the unconsummated wife of my soul and I was all too eager to prove how much I loved you, loved ''[[God in Christianity|Him]]'', by being willing to give you up. Like [[Abraham]], like [[Isaac]], I was led by my beliefs to believe we would be spared. I was protecting you from the evil of this age, the evil in myself.

On November 19, 1849, Frederik Schlegel received a letter from Kierkegaard entreating him to allow him to speak to Olsen.  Schlegel did not respond to the letter and denied Kierkegaard further requests to talk with Olsen. On the 10th of September 1852, the twelfth anniversary of the engangment they met once again but neither engnaged in conversation, just admiration, which Kierkegaard found agonizing.<ref name=\"Muse\">{{cite book |last=Garff |first=Joakim|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h8iXDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA127&lpg=PA127&dq=sovereign+mistress+of+my+heart+kierkegaard&source=bl&ots=Dye9bgQ2Q1&sig=ACfU3U2xV9HMiz0j75zbqBhDcQAc876u9w&hl=en&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Kierkegaard's Muse: The Mystery of Regine Olsen |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2017 |isbn=978-0-691-17176-0}}</ref> On [[Christmas]] day of that year, they met once again however Kierkegaard noted that it seemed as if she was waiting for him or someone at least. Kierkegaard found the excange to be odd and deeply personal and even afterwards he felt as if she was \"searching me with her eyes\".<ref name=\"Muse\"/> Soon afterwards, Frederik was appointed governor of the [[Danish West Indies]], and Olsen accompanied him there, departing on March 17, 1855.<ref name=Tudvad39 /> Before leaving she visited Kierkegaard one last time exclaiming to him, \u201cGod bless you \u2014 may good things come your way!\u201d.<ref name=\"LARB\" /> She was never to see Kierkegaard again.\n\nOlsen found the journey to be troublesome citing the \"complete spiritual apthay\" as the worst element in her letter to her sister and [[confidant]] Cornelia. She also found it hard parting from her mother Regine Frederikke, now a widow of six years after the death of her husband Terkild, Maria her eldest sister whose house Olsen and friends would frequent in summer and most importantly her sister Cornelia who olsen was closest to in age and nature. Cornelia was strongly admired by not only Olsen, but Kierkegaard as well who described her as the \"most excellent female character i have known and the only who has compelled my admiration\" and a character of a similar name appeared in [[The Seducer's Diary]].<ref name=\"Muse\"/>   \n\nAfter Kierkegaard's death 8 months after her departure, Olsen experienced feelings of guilt and regret, revealing in her letters to Henrik Lund that she regrets being unable to resolve the tension between her and Kierkegaard as she intended to in later life and she feels as if she wronged him.<ref name=\"LARB\" />\n\nOlson and Schlegel returned from Saint Croix in 1860 and spent the rest of their lives in Copenhagen. Upon their time there, (Olson, in particular), they familiarised themselves with diaries of Kierkegaard. The release was controversial at the time due to subjects of passages still alive such as Olson. Upon reading sections dedicated to her, Schlegel recalled she would become physically ill.<ref name=\"LARB\" />\n\nFrederick would soon become ill and die on June 8, 1896 a time in which Olsen was equally ill dealing with depression and [[influenza]].<ref name=\"EWK/> In 1897, Olsen moved to Frederiksberg to live with her older brother. Schlegel's death left her a widow not only to him, but in her eyes Kierkegaard aswell.<ref name=\"Jstor\"/>\n\nAfter the death of Schlegel, she accepted requests by biographers, commentators and friends, to discuss her side of the relationship between her and Kierkegaard.  The interviewers include Hanne Mourier, Raphael Meyer, Peter Munthe Brun, Robert Neiiendam, Julius Clausen, and [[Georg Brandes]].<ref>''Encounters'', Ch. 3</ref> In 1898 she decided to dictate to, among others, the librarian Raphael Meyer the story of her engagement to Kierkegaard. This account was published after Olsen's death in 1904 as ''Kierkegaardian Papers: The Engagement; Published on Behalf of Mrs. Regine Schlegel'', but in general scholars concede that it offers little information that wasn't already known through Kierkegaard and other sources. Olsen is buried in [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]] in Copenhagen, along with both Kierkegaard and Frederik Schlegel.

When he absconded to [[Berlin]] in 1842 to study philosophy, he was haunted by a woman who bore an uncanny resemblance to Olsen. Even while immersing himself in his studies, she was always on his mind: \"Not even here in [[Berlin]] has my, alas, all-too-inventive brain been able to refrain from scheming something or other. She must either love me or hate me, she knows no third possibility. Nor is there anything more harmful to a young girl than half-way situations.\"<ref>Garff, ''SAK'', p. 175. \"Mit destov\u00e6rre, altfor opfindsomme Hoved har end ikke her i Berlin, kunnet undlade at udt\u00e6nke et og andet.

Der er heller intet ford\u00e6rveligere for en ung Pige end Mellemtilstandende.\"</ref> It was during this time that Kierkegaard was formulating his own philosophy, as well as his first book, ''[[Either/Or]]''. It seems by the time of his death he still held his feelings of love to Olsen as she was the only person listed in his will, whom Kierkegaard, for all intents and purposes, considered himself married to. Olsen ultimately rejected the will.\n\n{{Quotation|It is naturally my will that my former fianc\u00e9e, Mrs Regine Schlegel, should inherit unconditionally what little I leave behind. If she herself refuses to accept it, it is to be offered to her on the condition that she act as a trustee for its distribution to the poor.\n\nWhat I wish to express is that for me an engagement was and is just as binding as a marriage, and that therefore my estate is to revert to her in exactly the same manner as if I had been married to her. <ref name=\"LARB\"/><ref name=\"KIERKEGAARD THE CELIBATE\"/>}}\n\nKierkegaard would frequently confide in his friend Emil Boesen about matters relating to Olsen. In one instance Bosen suggested that Kierkegaard stop learning what he can of Olsen, to which Kierkegaard enraged replied: {{Quotation|So you would leave me to my Daydreams! In this you are mistaken. I am not dreaming, I am awake. I do not turn her into poetry. I do not call her to my mind, but I call myself to account.

In some ways, it is difficult to understand Kierkegaard fully without at least a cursory knowledge of his failed relationship to Regine.\n\nKierkegaard's failed relationship with Olsen influenced his views on marriage, love, commitment, authenticity, and perhaps above all, faith and relationship to God. His mention of her in his writings, however, (aside from his personal journals) is always indirect.  ''[[Either/Or]]'', Kierkegaard's first book, is full of veiled references to his relationship with Olsen.  Aside from lengthy sections dealing with the matters of erotic seduction and a sermon on the virtues of marriage, it includes ''[[The Seducer's Diary]]'', featuring a young man who calculates his seduction of a young girl from afar, and upon winning her affection, breaking off the relationship.  The story has strong parallels to Kierkegaard's relationship to Olsen and has often been taken to be a fictionalization of it, intending to portray Kierkegaard, as cold and callous and Olsen, innocent and victimized.<ref name=\"KIERKEGAARD THE CELIBATE\"/> Kierkegaard made this clear in his journals writing that:{{Quotation|I must have her husband interposed between us. Either/Or! If am to become involved with her it must be on the grandest scale, and I would want it to be known to everyone, with her transformed into a triumphant figure who would be granted the fullest restitution for all the disparagement that was her lot because I had broken my engagement to her. <ref name=\"Jstor\">{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Tess|title=S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard: A Master of Refraction|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20464533?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A1011c317e7dd3c11dbb3702a1e11f25b&seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=The Hudson Review|volume=59|date=2006|accessdate=March 23, 2020}}</ref>}}''[[Stages on Life's Way]]'' contains an analysis of the three \"spheres of existence\" \u2014 the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious.  As the ethical corresponds to dedicating one's life to another \u2013 to marriage \u2013 the religious corresponds to dedicating one's self to God. It seems to have been this decision \u2013 this \"either/or\" \u2014 which consumed Kierkegaard during the years of his engagement, and he felt that he could not reconcile his marriage with his religious calling.  \n\n[[Fear and Trembling]] has frequently been seen as analogous for Kierkegaard and Olsen's relationship mirroring the tale of [[Binding of Isaac|Abraham sacrificing Issac]]. Biographer and writer of 'Philosopher of the Heart: The Restless Life of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard' Clare Carlisle said that Kierkegaard \"feels he has sacrificed a life with Regine, and with it his own honour and his family\u2019s good name, for the sake of something that is difficult to explain\".<ref name=\"NS\"/>\n\nWith the exception of a single work dedicated to [[Poul Martin M\u00f8ller]], Kierkegaard dedicated all of his writings to his father, another formative figure in his life, and to Olsen.\n\n==Historical Intrest==\nIn 1995 Kierkegaard biographer [[Joakim Garff]] gained access to letters written by Regine to her sister Cornelia during the period of the Schlegels' time in the West Indies. Though somewhat guarded, her letters reveal Regine's discomfort with the tropical climate and distaste for what she viewed as the superficiality and pettiness of colonial life. She does not refer to Kierkegaard directly in these letters, despite receiving and reading his posthumous papers from Kierkegaard's nephew Henrik Lund during this period.<ref name=Garff>Garff, Joakim.

On September 8, 1840, Kierkegaard finally revealed his feelings to Olsen when she was playing the piano for him at her family's house.  He recounted the events years later in his journal: \"'Oh!  What do I care for music, it's you I want, I have wanted you for two years.'  She kept silent.\"  Kierkegaard proceeded to plead his case to Etatsraad (Councilman) Olsen, Olsen's father, immediately.  Her father granted Kierkegaard his blessing, and the two became engaged to be married.<ref name=\"Journals\">An edited account of Kierkegaard's relation to Olsen and her family, from the point of view of Kierkegaard, appears roughly around August 1849 in Journals, 49 X 5 A 149</ref> Until the eventual dissolution of their engagement, they lived quite happily as Kierkegaard used Olsen as a sort of [[confidant]]. Each week, for instance, she would listen to Kierkegaard reading aloud to her a sermon from Bishop Mynster of Copenhagen.<ref name=\"KIERKEGAARD THE CELIBATE\"/>\n\nAlmost immediately, however, Kierkegaard began to have doubts about his ability to be a husband.  Throughout the following year, Kierkegaard threw himself into his work.  He began his [[seminarian]] studies, preached his first [[sermon]], and wrote his [[dissertation]] for his [[Magister (degree)|magister degree]].  Olsen sensed that Kierkegaard's ostensibly busy schedule was a pretence for avoiding her, an action which pained Kierkegaard deeply to do.<ref name=\"KIERKEGAARD THE CELIBATE\"/> They did maintain a voluminous correspondence; for a time he wrote her cryptic letters every Wednesday. Kierkegaard's letters have survived, but, aside from a few lines, Olsen's letters seem to have been destroyed.<ref name=\"Reglet\">In an interview in 1896, Olsen claims to have burned her letters to Kierkegaard, when she accepted the portion of Kierkegaard's inheritance relating to her.  See ''Encounters, p. 38''.</ref>  \n\nKierkegaard's letters were very reminiscent of Abelard's letter to Philintus where Abelard wrote: {{Quotation|Fulbert surprised me with Heloise, but what man that had a soul in him would not have borne any ignominy on the same conditions? The next day I provided myself with a private lodging near the loved house, being resolved not to abandon my prey. I abode some time without appearing publicly. Ah! how long did those few days seem to me! When we fall from a state of happiness with what impatience do we bear our misfortunes! It being impossible that I could live without seeing Heloise, I endeavoured to engage her servant, whose name was Agaton, in my interest. She was brown, well-shaped, and a person superior to her rank; her features were regular and her eyes sparkling, fit to raise love in any man whose heart was not prepossessed by another passion. I met her alone and entreated her to have pity on a distressed lover.

Olsen was shattered by his rejection of her, and was unwilling to accept Kierkegaard's breaking of their engagement, threatening to kill herself if he did not take her back.<ref name=Tudvad39>Tudvad, ''Kierkegaards K\u00f8benhavn'', p. 39.</ref> Kierkegaard attempted to quell her interest, he later wrote, \"there was nothing else for me to do but to venture to the uttermost, to support her, if possible, by means of deception, to do everything to repel her from me to rekindle her pride.\"<ref name=\"Journals1\">Again in Journals, slight difference in translation, 49&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;5 A 149.</ref> He wrote her cold, calculated letters to make it seem that he didn't love her anymore, but Olsen clung to the hope that they would get back together, desperately pleading to him to take her back.  On October 11, 1841, Kierkegaard met with her and again broke off the engagement in person.  Her father tried to persuade him to reconsider after assessing Olsen's desperate condition, claiming that \"It will be the death of her; she is in total despair\"<ref name=\"Journals1\" /> Kierkegaard returned the next day and spoke with Olsen. To her query as to whether he would ever marry, Kierkegaard icily responded: \"Well, yes, in ten years, when I have begun to simmer down and I need a lusty young miss to rejuvenate me.\"<ref name=\"Journals1\" />  In reality, Kierkegaard had no such plans, and would remain a celibate bachelor for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"unsure\">There is really no way to know this for sure, but based on his journal entries, it seems highly likely.  \"I saw a pretty girl today \u2014 that does not interest me anymore...

Olsen's family reacted with a mixture of confusion, finding Kierkegaard's actions incomprehensible, to outright hatred for causing Olsen such pain although Olsen's sister Cornelia believed that despite not understanding Kierkegaard's actions she nevertheless believed him to be a good person.<ref name=\"Muse\"/>  Kierkegaard would later beg for Olsen to forgive him for his actions.  In a famous letter, he wrote, \"Above all, forget the one who writes this; forgive someone who, whatever else, could not make a girl happy.\"<ref name=\"Hannay\">Hannay's ''Kierkegaard'' p. 155</ref>\n\n====Kierkegaard's concern====\nKierkegaard was so concerned that Olsen might actually destroy herself because she said she couldn't live without him that he tried to give her advice in his [[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844|''Fourth Upbuilding Discourse of 1844'']]. He wanted her to be able to stand on her own with or without him. He asked her: {{Quotation|\"When the first self submits to the deeper self, they are reconciled and walk on together. ... Would you be better off now by having lost some of that burning desire and having won the understanding that life cannot deceive you; is not that kind of losing a winning? That little secret we two have between us, as the deeper self said. What, presumably, is this secret, my listener? What else but this, that with regard to the external a person is capable of nothing at all. If he wants to seize the external immediately, it can be changed in the same instant, and he can be deceived; on the other hand, he can take it with the consciousness that it could also be changed, and he is not deceived even though it is changed, because he has the deeper self's consent. If he wants to act immediately in the external, to accomplish something, everything can become nothing in that same moment; on the other hand, he can act with this consciousness, and even if it came to nothing, he is not deceived, because he has the deeper self's consent. But even if the first self and the deeper self have been reconciled in this way and the shared mind has been diverted away from the external, this is still only the condition of coming to know himself. But if he is actually to know himself, there are new struggles and new dangers.\" S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', 1844, Hong translation p. 316-317 (Four Upbuilding Discourses)}}\n\nKierkegaard mentioned the concern that awoke his conscience in this Upbuilding Discourses and came to the conclusion that the power of forgiveness is a good and perfect gift from God. (See: ''[[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]'', and: ''Love Will Hide a Multitude of Sins''<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20peter%204&version=ESV. See: 1 Peter 4:7\u201312, The Holy Bible].) Kierkegaard decided to forgive Olsen so that his love might hide her sin from the eyes of God just as Christ's love hides our sin from the eyes of God.</ref> (See: ''[[Three Upbuilding Discourses|Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]''.)\nHe wanted one thing from Regine that she would not give, [[forgiveness]]. If one can't forgive another how does one forgive himself or herself or expect forgiveness from God? He wrote the following in 1845: \n\n[[File:Kierkegaard 20090502-DSCF1492.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] by [[Louis Hasselriis]]]]\n<blockquote>\n\"That it [the broken engagement] can be forgiven, if not here then nevertheless in an eternity. Is there anything dubious about this forgiveness? Yes, there is \u2013 that I do not have her forgiveness; and she is and remains an intermediate court, a legitimate court, that must not be bypassed. Her forgiveness certainly cannot justify me eternally, no more than a person's implacability can harm anyone but himself, but her forgiveness is a part of a divine procedure. Why, then, do you not have it? Because I could not make myself understandable to her. ... Suppose she had forgiven me. Then, of course, she would not have forgotten me. But can we see each other then? Suppose she stood beside someone else. When she stands that way within time, I am standing in her path and therefore shall go away. But if I stood in her path in eternity, where should I go. Compared with eternity, is time the stronger? Has time the power to separate us eternally?\" S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, ''Stages on Life's Way'' (1845), Hong p. 380-382, 390\u2013391</blockquote><blockquote>What would indeed be as disconsolate, yes, almost to the point of despair, as this-if, at the moment when the misunderstanding one returned and sought understanding, when the unfriendly one returned and sought friendship, when the one who had hated returned and sought reconciliation-what would be as disconsolate as this: if the one who loves has then wasted away, so that neither understanding nor the restoration of friendship nor the renewal of reconciliation in love could really take place with the blessed joy of eternity!

Johannes Hohlenberg preserved a letter she wrote to Henrik Lund, Kierkegaard's nephew, in which she said, \"His death filled me not only with sorrow but with concern, as though by postponing action I had committed a great injustice against him. \u2026. But since his death, it has seemed to me as if it were a duty I had neglected from cowardice; a duty not only towards him, but towards God, to whom he sacrificed me, whether he did it from an innate tendency to self-torment (a misgiving he himself had), or whether, as I think time and the results of his work will show, from a higher call from God.\"<ref>''S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, a Biography'' by Johannes Hohlenberg 1954 P. 230-231</ref>\n\n===Later Years and Marriage to Johan Frederik Schlegel===\n[[Image:Regine Olsen (1870).jpg|thumb|Regine Olsen, circa 1840s]]\n\nOn April 16, 1843, Kierkegaard was leaving Vor Frue Church when he saw Olsen who nodded to him which Kierkegaard understood to mean she had forgiven him. This was an important interaction for them which would signify Olsen moving on. Kierkegaard would later write in his journal:{{Quotation|At Vespers on Easter Sunday in Frue Kirke (during Mynster's sermon), she nodded to me. I do not know if it was pleadingly or forgivingly, but in any case very affectionately. I had sat down in a place apart, but she discovered it. Would to God that she had not done so. Now a year and a half of suffering and all the enormous pains I took are wasted; she does not believe that I was a deceiver, she has faith in me. What ordeals now lie ahead of her. The next will be that I am a hypocrite. The higher we go, the more dreadful it is. That a man of my inwardness, of my religiousness, could act in such a way. And yet I can no longer live solely for her, cannot expose myself to the contempt of men in order to lose my honor\u2014that I have done. Shall I in sheer madness go ahead and become a villain just to get her to believe it\u2014ah, what help is that. She will still believe that I was not that before (Journals, IV A 97). <ref name=\"SK2\"/>}}\n\nOn November 3, 1847, Olsen married her old tutor, [[Johan Frederik Schlegel]], in the [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]] in Copenhagen.<ref>Tudvad, ''Kierkegaards K\u00f8benhavn'', pp. 418\u20139.</ref> The marriage was happy and stable. The two even read aloud to each other passages from Kierkegaard's writings, which were then getting much attention in Denmark. On the day of her wedding, Kierkegaard wrote to her pleading for forgiveness.{{Quotation|Your are my sacrifice, the unconsummated wife of my soul and I was all too eager to prove how much I loved you, loved ''[[God in Christianity|Him]]'', by being willing to give you up.

On November 19, 1849, Frederik Schlegel received a letter from Kierkegaard entreating him to allow him to speak to Olsen.  Schlegel did not respond to the letter and denied Kierkegaard further requests to talk with Olsen. On the 10th of September 1852, the twelfth anniversary of the engangment they met once again but neither engnaged in conversation, just admiration, which Kierkegaard found agonizing.<ref name=\"Muse\">{{cite book |last=Garff |first=Joakim|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h8iXDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA127&lpg=PA127&dq=sovereign+mistress+of+my+heart+kierkegaard&source=bl&ots=Dye9bgQ2Q1&sig=ACfU3U2xV9HMiz0j75zbqBhDcQAc876u9w&hl=en&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Kierkegaard's Muse: The Mystery of Regine Olsen |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2017 |isbn=978-0-691-17176-0}}</ref> On [[Christmas]] day of that year, they met once again however Kierkegaard noted that it seemed as if she was waiting for him or someone at least. Kierkegaard found the excange to be odd and deeply personal and even afterwards he felt as if she was \"searching me with her eyes\".<ref name=\"Muse\"/> Soon afterwards, Frederik was appointed governor of the [[Danish West Indies]], and Olsen accompanied him there, departing on March 17, 1855.<ref name=Tudvad39 /> Before leaving she visited Kierkegaard one last time exclaiming to him, \u201cGod bless you \u2014 may good things come your way!\u201d.<ref name=\"LARB\" /> She was never to see Kierkegaard again.\n\nOlsen found the journey to be troublesome citing the \"complete spiritual apthay\" as the worst element in her letter to her sister and [[confidant]] Cornelia. She also found it hard parting from her mother Regine Frederikke, now a widow of six years after the death of her husband Terkild, Maria her eldest sister whose house Olsen and friends would frequent in summer and most importantly her sister Cornelia who olsen was closest to in age and nature. Cornelia was strongly admired by not only Olsen, but Kierkegaard as well who described her as the \"most excellent female character i have known and the only who has compelled my admiration\" and a character of a similar name appeared in [[The Seducer's Diary]].<ref name=\"Muse\"/>   \n\nAfter Kierkegaard's death 8 months after her departure, Olsen experienced feelings of guilt and regret, revealing in her letters to Henrik Lund that she regrets being unable to resolve the tension between her and Kierkegaard as she intended to in later life and she feels as if she wronged him.<ref name=\"LARB\" />\n\nOlson and Schlegel returned from Saint Croix in 1860 and spent the rest of their lives in Copenhagen. Upon their time there, (Olson, in particular), they familiarised themselves with diaries of Kierkegaard. The release was controversial at the time due to subjects of passages still alive such as Olson. Upon reading sections dedicated to her, Schlegel recalled she would become physically ill.<ref name=\"LARB\" />\n\nFrederick would soon become ill and die on June 8, 1896 a time in which Olsen was equally ill dealing with depression and [[influenza]].<ref name=\"EWK/> In 1897, Olsen moved to Frederiksberg to live with her older brother. Schlegel's death left her a widow not only to him, but in her eyes Kierkegaard aswell.<ref name=\"Jstor\"/>\n\nAfter the death of Schlegel, she accepted requests by biographers, commentators and friends, to discuss her side of the relationship between her and Kierkegaard.  The interviewers include Hanne Mourier, Raphael Meyer, Peter Munthe Brun, Robert Neiiendam, Julius Clausen, and [[Georg Brandes]].<ref>''Encounters'', Ch. 3</ref> In 1898 she decided to dictate to, among others, the librarian Raphael Meyer the story of her engagement to Kierkegaard. This account was published after Olsen's death in 1904 as ''Kierkegaardian Papers: The Engagement; Published on Behalf of Mrs. Regine Schlegel'', but in general scholars concede that it offers little information that wasn't already known through Kierkegaard and other sources. Olsen is buried in [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]] in Copenhagen, along with both Kierkegaard and Frederik Schlegel.  In his commentary about her, Robert Neiiendam wrote that \"she knew 'that he took her with him into history.' And this thought made up for what she had suffered.\"<ref>''Encounters'', p. 54</ref>\n\nIn her final years, childhood friend Raphael Meyer said that:{{Quotation|She had a simple youthful longing to see her Fritz again, and yet she repeated with sincere conviction Kierkegaard\u2019s words to her: 'You see, Regine, in eternity there is no marriage; there, both Schlegel and I will happily be together with you\u2019 <ref name=\"KIERKEGAARD THE CELIBATE\"/>}}\n\n==Effect of breakup on Kierkegaard==\n[[File:Soren Kierkegaard's relation to his bride 1904.JPG|thumb|right|200px|S\u00f6ren Kierkegaard's relation to his fiancee]]Kierkegaard never fully recovered from his failed relationship with Olsen, remaining forever smitten with her, writing in a letter addressed to Olsen he said {{Quotation|Everywhere, in the face of every girl, I see the features of your beauty, but I think I would have to possess the beauty of all the girls in the world to extract your beauty,that I would have to sail around the world to find the portion of the world I want and toward which the deepest secret of my self polarically points-and in the next moment you are so close to me, so present, so overwhelmingly filling my spirit that I am transfigured to myself and feel that here it is good to be. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Pattison|first=George|date=1990|title=A DRAMA OF LOVE AND DEATH: MICHAEL PEDERSEN KIERKEGAARD AND REGINE OLSEN REVISITED|Journal=History of European Ideas|Volume=12|pages=79-91|doi= 10.1016/0191-6599(90)90120-4|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>}} For a time in between their break-up and her marriage to Schlegel, they had polite and civil contact during daily walks and in church.  These were mostly non-verbal on Kierkegaard's part and caused him great anxiety, although he still was able to find joy in the interactions, writing in his journal.\u201cAs often happens to me of late, I can\u2019t help but smile when I see her\".<ref name=\"LARB\">{{cite web|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/keeper-loves-flame-regine-olsen-soren-kierkegaard/|title=A Keeper of Love\u2019s Flame: Regine Olsen and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|website=[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]|last=H\u00f8i Jensen|first= Morten|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref> For example On his 39th birthday, Olsen appeared to him at his house in [[\u00d8sterbro]], Kierkegaard returned the greeting and they both went their separate ways.<ref name=\"LARB\" /> It seems that he was attempting to utilize his complicated authorial method of [[indirect communication]] in his personal life, and his tormented approach caused him great distress.  When he absconded to [[Berlin]] in 1842 to study philosophy, he was haunted by a woman who bore an uncanny resemblance to Olsen. Even while immersing himself in his studies, she was always on his mind: \"Not even here in [[Berlin]] has my, alas, all-too-inventive brain been able to refrain from scheming something or other. She must either love me or hate me, she knows no third possibility. Nor is there anything more harmful to a young girl than half-way situations.\"<ref>Garff, ''SAK'', p. 175. \"Mit destov\u00e6rre, altfor opfindsomme Hoved har end ikke her i Berlin, kunnet undlade at udt\u00e6nke et og andet. Enten maa hun elske mig eller hade mig, hun kjender intet Tredie. Der er heller intet ford\u00e6rveligere for en ung Pige end Mellemtilstandende.\"</ref> It was during this time that Kierkegaard was formulating his own philosophy, as well as his first book, ''[[Either/Or]]''. It seems by the time of his death he still held his feelings of love to Olsen as she was the only person listed in his will, whom Kierkegaard, for all intents and purposes, considered himself married to. Olsen ultimately rejected the will.\n\n{{Quotation|It is naturally my will that my former fianc\u00e9e, Mrs Regine Schlegel, should inherit unconditionally what little I leave behind. If she herself refuses to accept it, it is to be offered to her on the condition that she act as a trustee for its distribution to the poor.\n\nWhat I wish to express is that for me an engagement was and is just as binding as a marriage, and that therefore my estate is to revert to her in exactly the same manner as if I had been married to her. <ref name=\"LARB\"/><ref name=\"KIERKEGAARD THE CELIBATE\"/>}}\n\nKierkegaard would frequently confide in his friend Emil Boesen about matters relating to Olsen. In one instance Bosen suggested that Kierkegaard stop learning what he can of Olsen, to which Kierkegaard enraged replied: {{Quotation|So you would leave me to my Daydreams! In this you are mistaken. I am not dreaming, I am awake. I do not turn her into poetry. I do not call her to my mind, but I call myself to account. This is as far as I can go: I think I am able to turn anything into poetry, but when it comes to duty, obligation, responsibility, etc., I cannot and will not turn those into poetic subjects. If she had broken our engagement, my soul would soon have driven the plough of forgetfulness over her, and she would have served me as others have done before her\u2014but now, now I serve her. If it were in her power to surround me with vigilant scouts who were always putting me in mind of her, she could still not be so clearly remembered as she is now in all her righteousness, all her beauty, all her pain. So just keep me informed. In the course of these recent events my soul has received a needed baptism, but that baptism was certainly not by sprinkling, for I have descended into the waters, all has gone black before my eyes, but I rise to the surface again. Nothing, after all, so develops a human being as adhering to a plan in defiance of the whole world. Even if it were something evil, it would still serve to a high degree to develop a person...

In some ways, it is difficult to understand Kierkegaard fully without at least a cursory knowledge of his failed relationship to Regine.\n\nKierkegaard's failed relationship with Olsen influenced his views on marriage, love, commitment, authenticity, and perhaps above all, faith and relationship to God. His mention of her in his writings, however, (aside from his personal journals) is always indirect.  ''[[Either/Or]]'', Kierkegaard's first book, is full of veiled references to his relationship with Olsen.  Aside from lengthy sections dealing with the matters of erotic seduction and a sermon on the virtues of marriage, it includes ''[[The Seducer's Diary]]'', featuring a young man who calculates his seduction of a young girl from afar, and upon winning her affection, breaking off the relationship.  The story has strong parallels to Kierkegaard's relationship to Olsen and has often been taken to be a fictionalization of it, intending to portray Kierkegaard, as cold and callous and Olsen, innocent and victimized.<ref name=\"KIERKEGAARD THE CELIBATE\"/> Kierkegaard made this clear in his journals writing that:{{Quotation|I must have her husband interposed between us. Either/Or! If am to become involved with her it must be on the grandest scale, and I would want it to be known to everyone, with her transformed into a triumphant figure who would be granted the fullest restitution for all the disparagement that was her lot because I had broken my engagement to her. <ref name=\"Jstor\">{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Tess|title=S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard: A Master of Refraction|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20464533?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A1011c317e7dd3c11dbb3702a1e11f25b&seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=The Hudson Review|volume=59|date=2006|accessdate=March 23, 2020}}</ref>}}''[[Stages on Life's Way]]'' contains an analysis of the three \"spheres of existence\" \u2014 the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious.  As the ethical corresponds to dedicating one's life to another \u2013 to marriage \u2013 the religious corresponds to dedicating one's self to God. It seems to have been this decision \u2013 this \"either/or\" \u2014 which consumed Kierkegaard during the years of his engagement, and he felt that he could not reconcile his marriage with his religious calling.  \n\n[[Fear and Trembling]] has frequently been seen as analogous for Kierkegaard and Olsen's relationship mirroring the tale of [[Binding of Isaac|Abraham sacrificing Issac]]. Biographer and writer of 'Philosopher of the Heart: The Restless Life of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard' Clare Carlisle said that Kierkegaard \"feels he has sacrificed a life with Regine, and with it his own honour and his family\u2019s good name, for the sake of something that is difficult to explain\".<ref name=\"NS\"/>\n\nWith the exception of a single work dedicated to [[Poul Martin M\u00f8ller]], Kierkegaard dedicated all of his writings to his father, another formative figure in his life, and to Olsen.\n\n==Historical Intrest==\nIn 1995 Kierkegaard biographer [[Joakim Garff]] gained access to letters written by Regine to her sister Cornelia during the period of the Schlegels' time in the West Indies. Though somewhat guarded, her letters reveal Regine's discomfort with the tropical climate and distaste for what she viewed as the superficiality and pettiness of colonial life. She does not refer to Kierkegaard directly in these letters, despite receiving and reading his posthumous papers from Kierkegaard's nephew Henrik Lund during this period.<ref name=Garff>Garff, Joakim.

Pezz began writing, performing songs, and gaining attention and credibility at first locally, and soon in [[Toronto]]'s broader [[Independent music|indie music]] scene. Their first recording was a cheap 4-track demo. It was recorded in Ian D'Sa's basement in July 1994 and was named ''Demoluca'', after a friend of the band named Jason Deluca had stopped by the house, banging on a basement window while the band was recording. Soon after, on January 1995, they all put in money to record another demo of better quality with engineer/producer Dave Tedesco at the \"Signal to Noise\" studio which they called ''[[Dudebox]]''.<ref name=BeforeFamous>\"Before They Were Famous\". {{cite web |url=http://www.exploremusic.com/ongoing-history-of-new-music/2009-05-27/Ongoing-History-On-Air-Schedule-Since-1993 |title=The Ongoing History of New Music |date=November 11, 2005 |publisher=[[CFNY]] }}</ref> Originally, two tracks from ''Demoluca'' and four newly recorded tracks were compiled onto it, but a year later the band recorded four more tunes live in the studio and re-released it.

Gallant almost finished a business degree. Kowalewicz was in between jobs, one which included working at [[CFNY-FM|102.1 the edge]]. Solowoniuk worked at [[Chrysler Canada]].

Kowalewicz started singing in melody with D'Sa. The music began to transform from \"raw rap-rock\" songs into \"catchy and angst-ridden pop-punk anthems\".

The Canadian band had no legal claim to their old name and thus changed it to Billy Talent, inspired by the guitarist \"Billy Tallent\"<!-- This name was seen in a vision that Ben had involving riding a platypus going to the planet unicorn. When asked about this experience further Ben said \" Dude you just had to be there\" --> from [[Michael Turner (musician)|Michael Turner]]'s novel ''[[Hard Core Logo]]''.

During this time, Kowalewicz ran into Jen Hirst, at [[CFNY-FM|102.1 the edge]], the Toronto radio station he worked at. She had seen the band perform as Pezz, and he asked her to check out the band's performance at a club. This would prove to pay off, as Hirst was later hired by [[Warner Music Canada]] to work in [[A&R]]. This connection would get the band their producer [[Gavin Brown (musician)|Gavin Brown]], and a demo deal with the label. Before the demos were recorded, a local manager called [[Atlantic Records]] A&R executives, who were already in Toronto, to see the band perform in its tiny rehearsal space.<ref name=Accessmag/>\n\n[[File: Billy Talent at Rock Am See 2007.jpg|right|thumb|The band found much success in their home country, with their debut album going [[Music Canada|3x platinum]] in Canada.<ref name=CRIA0107/>]]\n\nIn 2002, the band met with record executives, and ended up signing a co-venture agreement with [[Atlantic Records]] and [[Warner Music Canada]].<ref name=Accessmag/> In the fall of 2003, the band released their full-length self-titled album, ''[[Billy Talent (album)|Billy Talent]]''.

The band played sold-out shows in Canada and the United States and had success in Europe. The band received a [[Juno Award|Juno]], (They won two Junos, Best Album of the Year, and Best Band of the Year) and [[MuchMusic Video Award]] nominations and awards, and spent late 2004 and most of 2005 touring. ''Billy Talent'' went on to be certified 3x platinum in Canada.<ref name=CRIA0107/>\n\nA track from the album titled \"This Is How It Goes\" was about Aaron Solowoniuk's fight with [[multiple sclerosis]]. On March 17, 2006, Aaron Solowoniuk revealed in a personal letter to fans that he was the friend in that song. Solowoniuk was confirmed to have the disease, which causes anything from numbness in the limbs to paralysis or loss of vision, in January 1999. His [[neurologist]] prescribed him medication that he would have to self inject three times a week, possibly for the rest of his life.

They formed in 1993 with lead vocalist [[Benjamin Kowalewicz]], guitarist [[Ian D'Sa]], bassist [[Jon Gallant]], and drummer [[Aaron Solowoniuk]]. There have been no lineup changes, although Solowoniuk is currently taking a hiatus from the band due to an MS relapse, and [[Jordan Hastings]] from [[Alexisonfire]], [[Cunter (band)|Cunter]], and Say Yes is currently filling in for him. In the 25 years since their inception, Billy Talent has sold over 900,000 physical albums in Canada alone and nearly 3 million albums internationally. Between 1995 and 2016, Billy Talent were the 27th best-selling Canadian artist in Canada and among the top 10 best-selling Canadian bands in Canada.<ref>{{cite website|url=https://bdsradio.com/pd/docs/Nielsen_Canadian150_2017_vs2.pdf|title=NIELSEN MUSIC & BILLBOARD PRESENT CANADA 150 CHARTS|website=bdsradio.com|p=28|accessdate=January 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe band existed for almost a decade before mainstream success. The members met and played in [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School]] under the name '''Pezz''' and remained underground in [[Toronto]]'s indie music scene until 2001. The band renamed itself Billy Talent after running into legal trouble with the old name. It was then that Kowalewicz's connection with an employee of [[Warner Music Canada]]'s [[A&R]] department landed the band a record deal and launched them into mainstream success.<ref name=\"Accessmag\"/> Since then, Billy Talent has made three multi-platinum records in Canada<ref name=CRIA0107>\n{{cite web|date=January 2007|title=CRIA Gold and Platinum Certifications for January 2007|url=http://www.cria.ca/gold/0107_g.php|publisher=[[Canadian Recording Industry Association]]|accessdate=July 4, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526084701/http://www.cria.ca/gold/0107_g.php|archivedate=May 26, 2010}}</ref> and continues to expand their success overseas; this included touring for 20 months supporting their [[Billy Talent II|second album]]. They released their third album, ''[[Billy Talent III]]'', on July 14, 2009, and their fourth album, ''[[Dead Silence (album)|Dead Silence]]'', on September 4, 2012.

In 2015, they began to prepare material for their fifth studio album. Just before entering the studio, drummer Aaron Solowoniuk decided to sit out the recording sessions while he continued his longstanding battle with [[multiple sclerosis]]. Fellow Canadian Jordan Hastings was quickly recruited to play as Solowoniuk's studio stand-in, and, in early 2016, the group completed work on ''[[Afraid of Heights (Billy Talent album)|Afraid of Heights]]'', which was released in July of that year.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins as Pezz (1993\u20131999)===\n<!-- {{Listen|type=sound|filename=Pezz - M & M.ogg|title=M & M|description=A sample of \"M & M\" from the album ''[[Watoosh!]]'', the band's first album.

Pezz began writing, performing songs, and gaining attention and credibility at first locally, and soon in [[Toronto]]'s broader [[Independent music|indie music]] scene. Their first recording was a cheap 4-track demo. It was recorded in Ian D'Sa's basement in July 1994 and was named ''Demoluca'', after a friend of the band named Jason Deluca had stopped by the house, banging on a basement window while the band was recording. Soon after, on January 1995, they all put in money to record another demo of better quality with engineer/producer Dave Tedesco at the \"Signal to Noise\" studio which they called ''[[Dudebox]]''.<ref name=BeforeFamous>\"Before They Were Famous\". {{cite web |url=http://www.exploremusic.com/ongoing-history-of-new-music/2009-05-27/Ongoing-History-On-Air-Schedule-Since-1993 |title=The Ongoing History of New Music |date=November 11, 2005 |publisher=[[CFNY]] }}</ref> Originally, two tracks from ''Demoluca'' and four newly recorded tracks were compiled onto it, but a year later the band recorded four more tunes live in the studio and re-released it.

Gallant almost finished a business degree. Kowalewicz was in between jobs, one which included working at [[CFNY-FM|102.1 the edge]]. Solowoniuk worked at [[Chrysler Canada]]. But during this, each member found the time and finances to max-out their credit cards, and record their first full-length album in 1999.<ref name=BeforeFamous/> They laid down twelve tracks at a studio called \"Great Big Music\", collaborating with [[Juno Award|Juno]]-nominated music producer [[Brad Nelson]]. Kowalewicz started singing in melody with D'Sa. The music began to transform from \"raw rap-rock\" songs into \"catchy and angst-ridden pop-punk anthems\". With that, ''[[Watoosh!]]'' was born and independently released.<ref name=PezzBio/> While popular within Toronto's [[indie (music)|indie]] scene, it did not reach large mainstream sales levels.<ref name=BeforeFamous/>\n\n=== Billy Talent and success (1999\u20132004) ===\nIn 1999, the Canadian Pezz received documentation from an American band named Pezz proving that the latter had held the name internationally since 1989. The Canadian band had no legal claim to their old name and thus changed it to Billy Talent, inspired by the guitarist \"Billy Tallent\"<!-- This name was seen in a vision that Ben had involving riding a platypus going to the planet unicorn. When asked about this experience further Ben said \" Dude you just had to be there\" --> from [[Michael Turner (musician)|Michael Turner]]'s novel ''[[Hard Core Logo]]''.

During this time, Kowalewicz ran into Jen Hirst, at [[CFNY-FM|102.1 the edge]], the Toronto radio station he worked at. She had seen the band perform as Pezz, and he asked her to check out the band's performance at a club. This would prove to pay off, as Hirst was later hired by [[Warner Music Canada]] to work in [[A&R]]. This connection would get the band their producer [[Gavin Brown (musician)|Gavin Brown]], and a demo deal with the label. Before the demos were recorded, a local manager called [[Atlantic Records]] A&R executives, who were already in Toronto, to see the band perform in its tiny rehearsal space.<ref name=Accessmag/>\n\n[[File: Billy Talent at Rock Am See 2007.jpg|right|thumb|The band found much success in their home country, with their debut album going [[Music Canada|3x platinum]] in Canada.<ref name=CRIA0107/>]]\n\nIn 2002, the band met with record executives, and ended up signing a co-venture agreement with [[Atlantic Records]] and [[Warner Music Canada]].<ref name=Accessmag/> In the fall of 2003, the band released their full-length self-titled album, ''[[Billy Talent (album)|Billy Talent]]''.

The band played sold-out shows in Canada and the United States and had success in Europe. The band received a [[Juno Award|Juno]], (They won two Junos, Best Album of the Year, and Best Band of the Year) and [[MuchMusic Video Award]] nominations and awards, and spent late 2004 and most of 2005 touring. ''Billy Talent'' went on to be certified 3x platinum in Canada.<ref name=CRIA0107/>\n\nA track from the album titled \"This Is How It Goes\" was about Aaron Solowoniuk's fight with [[multiple sclerosis]]. On March 17, 2006, Aaron Solowoniuk revealed in a personal letter to fans that he was the friend in that song.

It was designed to be a combination of the indigenous languages of [[Nigeria]] and to serve as a [[lingua franca]] to [[West Africa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/guosa-the-lingua-franca-to-oust-english.html|title=Guosa: The lingua franca to oust English|last=Okafor|first=Judd-Leonard|date=20 March 2016|website=dailytrust.com.ng|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\n== Linguistic Properties ==\n=== Source Languages ===\n\nThough Guosa draws its lexicon from at least 118 indigenous West African languages, it derives the bulk of its vocabulary from [[Hausa Language|Hausa]], [[Yoruba Language|Yoruba]], and [[Igbo language|Igbo]], either taken directly or made from a combination of words from these languages.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nico.gov.ng/index.php/category-list/1637-hausa-igbo-and-yoruba-are-the-tripod-of-guosa-language-igbineweka|title=\nHausa, Igbo and Yoruba Are The Tripod of Guosa Language \u2013 Igbineweka|last=Dimgba|first=Njideka|date=20 March 2016|website=www.nico.gov.ng|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> [[English language|English]] also provides many of the more technical terms, either directly or through one of the aforementioned African languages. Additionally, several words were produced a priori via [[sound symbolism]], e.g. meeh \"sheep\", yanmu-yanmu \"mosquito\", and wuam \"eat\".\n\nThe different parts of speech are often derived from specific languages. Most concrete nouns are derived from Hausa, while verbs and abstracts are derived from Igbo or Yoruba. Additionally, words from all three source languages are often fused to create a word that resembles all three. For example, the Guosa word ''m\u00e9ni'' \"what\" is derived from Hausa ''menini,'' Igbo ''gini,'' and Yoruba ''kini,'' all meaning \"what\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Igbin\u00e9w\u00e9k\u00e1|first=Alexander|date=31 January 2019|title=The Complete Dictionary of Guosa Language 2nd Revised Edition|url= |location=Bloomington, IN|publisher=iUniverse|page=|isbn=978-1-5320-6574-3|author-link=}}</ref>\n\n=== Phonology ===\n\nThe exact phonological values or amount of distinct phonemes in Guosa is unknown.

They almost exclusively appear in words with an English or other foreign source.\n# It is unknown exactly how many pre-nasalized stops are actually phonemes, and which, if any, are considered consonant clusters. Several do appear word initially in common words such as: ''ncha'' \"every\", ''nkami'' \"my\", ''mb\u00ed'' \"here\", ''njika'' \"evil\", ''ngate'' \"coast\", and ''ngb\u00e0'' \"time\". All other stops do appear with a preceding nasal word medially, but it is unclear if these are pre-nasalized stops or clusters of a nasal and a stop.\n# The rhotic is either a tap or a trill.\n# Syllabic consonants can appear as separate words, such as ng (present continuous marker). These always have the mid tone.\n# The plosives, nasals (/\u014b/ exempt), the fricatives (velars exempt), the approximants, and /d\u0292/ can be geminated, though minimal pairs are rare.\n# It is unknown if the palatal nasal is a phoneme or if it is simply the cluster /nj/.\n\n==== Vowels ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |&nbsp;\n! colspan=\"2\" |Short vowels\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Long vowels]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Nasal vowel|Nasal vowels]]\n|-\n![[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n!Front\n!Back\n!Front\n!Back\n|-\n![[Close vowel|Close]]\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|i}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|u}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|i\u02d0}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|u\u02d0}}\n| align=\"center\" |({{IPA|\u0129}})\n| align=\"center\" |({{IPA|\u0169}})\n|-\n![[Close-mid vowel|Close-mid]]\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|e}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|o}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|e\u02d0}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|o\u02d0}}\n| align=\"center\" |({{IPA|\u1ebd}})\n| align=\"center\" |({{IPA|\u00f5}})\n|-\n![[Open vowel|Open]]\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |{{IPA|a}}\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |{{IPA|a\u02d0}}\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |({{IPA|\u00e3}})\n|}\nThough Guosa once had the seven vowel system similar to that of Yoruba, the vowels\n/\u025b/ and /\u0254/ have seemingly been merged into their closed counterparts, giving Guosa a five vowel system. Vowels can be either long or short, but the functional load of vowel length appears to be light, however, as very few minimal pairs exist when tone is taken into account. There are nasal vowels written with an \u27e8n\u27e9 following a vowel, though this does not always indicate a nasal vowel. The functional load of these is also light and the vast majority of nasal vowels are short. No two words differ in both the nasality of the vowels and vowel length.\n\nIt is unknown if there are diphthongs in Guosa; all vowels could be pronounced as separate syllables, or several vowels could form diphthongs. The phonology of Yoruba, however, suggests that Guosa vowels do not form diphthongs, as almost all the words with adjacent vowels come from Yoruba, in which all vowels are pronounced separately. \n\n==== Tone ====\n\nThere are three basic [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] in Guosa: high, mid, and low; there are also two [[Tone contour|contour tones]]: low-rising and high-falling. Mid is left unmarked and is seemingly the default tone, high is written with an acute \u27e8\u25cc\u0301\u27e9, low with a grave \u27e8\u25cc\u0300\u27e9. On short vowels the low-rising is written with a caron \u27e8\u25cc\u030c\u27e9 and high-falling with a circumflex \u27e8\u25cc\u0302\u27e9. With long vowels, the contour tones are split across the two vowels. With long vowels, the contour tones are written as two separate diacritics.\n\n==== Elision ====\n\n[[Elision]] takes place when two of the same vowels would be adjacent, or with certain grammatical particles. For example, when the plural marker \u00e9 is placed before a word beginning with a vowel: ''\u00e9 \u00f3m\u00f3nt\u00e0k\u00e9l\u00e9'' \u2192 ''\u00e9m\u00f3nt\u00e0k\u00e9l\u00e9''  \"little children\". This elision can be written with an apostrophe when the two vowels are the same: ''ji inang'' \u2192 ''ji'nang'' \"twenty four\". It can also be written as an apostrophe when the elision spans two words that are not particles: ''s\u00f2ng\u00ed \u00ecs\u00f3ng\u00e0'' \u2192 ''s\u00f2ng\u00ed 's\u00f3ng\u00e0'' \"sing a song\".\n\n==== Phonotactics ====\nA syllable in Guosa is generally of the form (C)(A)V(C), though more specialized loanwords may have the structure (C)(C)(C)V(C).\n\n=== Orthography ===\n\nThe Guosa alphabet contains 23 single letters, and several [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. The letters \u27e8q\u27e9 and \u27e8x\u27e9 are not used, and the letter \u27e8c\u27e9 only appears in the digraph \u27e8ch\u27e9. There used to be two vowel letters that seem to have almost completely disappeared from the current draft of the language: \u27e8\u1eb9\u27e9 and \u27e8\u1ecd\u27e9. Other than these abandoned letters, diacritics are only used to mark the tone of vowels. The digraph \u27e8ng\u27e9 represents /\u1d51g/ word-initially and possibly word-medially, but word-finally it represents /\u014b/\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Letter\n!

Most grammatical meaning is expressed through [[Grammatical particle|particles]] that precede the words they modify, such as ''\u00e9'' (plural), ''ng'' ([[Present continuous|present progressive]]), ''l\u00e1'' ([[perfective aspect]]), and ''k\u00e0'' ([[Volitive modality|volitive]]). There are no articles. Adjectives follow the noun. There is no grammatical gender or noun class system. Guosa is generally prepositional. \n\n==== Pronouns ====\nSome Guosa pronouns, unlike the rest of the words in the language, change depending on whether they are the subject or object. [[Animacy]] is not distinguished in pronouns, but plural is, and gender is distinguishable, albeit it is optional and only makes the distinction between female and male/neuter. The following is a known list of pronouns. Some of them are defined ambiguously, so the exact pronouns are unknown.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!subject\n!object/genitive\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |first person singular\n|'''m\u00f2''' (I)\n|'''m\u00ed''' (me/mine)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |second person singular\n|'''o''' (you, thou)\n|'''y\u00edn''' (you/your, thee/thy)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |third\nperson singular\n!masculine/neuter\n|'''\u00f3''' (he, it)\n|'''ya''' (him/his, it/its)\n|-\n!feminine\n|'''ta''' (she)\n|'''ta''' (she/her)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |first person plural\n|'''\u00e0w\u00e1''' (we)\n|'''<nowiki/>'w\u00e1, kew\u00e1''' (us/our)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |second person plural\n|'''ee''' (you all)\n|'''\u00e9y\u00edn''' (you all/all of your)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |third person plural\n|'''ha, fa, su''' (they)\n|'''ha, fa, su''' (they, them)\n|}\nAn intensive form of the pronoun us created by affixing the suffix ''-wan''. Though possessive is often indicated by simply having the object form of the pronoun follow the noun, the preposition ''nke'' \"of\" can be used to indicate unambiguous possession.\n\n==== Descriptors ====\nAdjectives and adverbs are not separate classes in Guosa and are jointly called descriptors, following whatever they modify. Some descriptors only act as adjectives or adverbs, however.\n\nIn Guosa there are four regular degrees of comparison. The word ''j\u00f9'' \"more\" is used to form a comparative from an adjective: ''r\u00e1m\u00e1'' \"good\" \u2192 ''r\u00e1m\u00e1 j\u00f9'' \"better\". The superlative simply combines the adverb ''kh\u00e0'' \"very\" with ''j\u00f9'': ''r\u00e1m\u00e1 j\u00f9 kh\u00e0'' \"best\" (lit. very more good). Finally, there is a forth degree of comparison above superlative. Though the superlative might indicate the highest of value in a certain group, the degree indicated by the category higher than the superlative shows that the indicated noun is the absolute best in its entire category; this is done with the ''kh\u00e0k\u00e1a'': ''rubi'' \"bad\" \u2192 ''rubi'' ''j\u00f9 kh\u00e0k\u00e1a'' \"the very worst\".\n\n==== Verbs ====\nIn Guosa, all verbs have one form; there is no conjugation. There is a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], ''w\u00f9'', but it is only used with a predicate noun. With predicate adjectives however, ''w\u00f9'' is not used, and the adjective behaves more like a verb. Compare the sentences ''m\u00f2 w\u00f9 m\u00e1mb\u00e9z\u00e8'' \"I am a king\" with ''m\u00f2 r\u00e1m\u00e1'' \"I am well\". \n\nThere are several particles that modify the tense, aspect, and mood of verbs. These particles usually precede the verbs they modify, but the particle l\u00e1 follows the verb instead.<ref>{{cite book |last=Igbin\u00e9w\u00e9k\u00e1|first=Alexander|date=1999|title=Teach Yourself Guosa Language Book 2: Nigeria\u2019s future common indigenous lingua franca|url= |location=Richmond, CA |publisher=Guosa Publication Services|page= |isbn= |author-link=}}</ref>\n\n* ''ng'' (present continual): ''m\u00f3 s\u00f2ng\u00ed 's\u00f3ng\u00e0'' \"I sing a song\" \u2192 ''m\u00f3 ng s\u00f2ng\u00ed 's\u00f3ng\u00e0'' \"I am singing a song\"\n\n* ''t\u00ed'' (perfect): ''m\u00f2 j\u00f2nd\u00fa'' \"I sit\" \u2192 ''m\u00f2 t\u00ed j\u00f2nd\u00fa'' \"I have sat\"\n\nThe particle l\u00e1 is used in a slightly different way, creating an adjective that functions similarity to an active past participle. This form can also take a direct object.\n\n* ''m\u00f3 k\u00f9nd\u00e9'' \"I wake up\"  \u2192 ''m\u00f3 k\u00f9nd\u00e9 l\u00e1'' \"I am awake\"\n\n==== Prepositions ====\n\n==== Numerals ====\nGuosa has a [[Decimal|base ten]] number system. The cardinal [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] are:\n\n''d\u00e1y\u00e1'' \"one\"\n\n''ej\u00ec'' \"two\"\n\n''\u00e8t\u00e1'' \"three\"\n\n''\u00ecn\u00e0ng'' \"four\"\n\n''\u00ecs\u00e9n'' \"five\"\n\n''\u00ecs\u00ed\u00ec'' \"six\"\n\n''as\u00e1\u00e0'' \"seven\"\n\n''as\u00e1to'' \"eight\"\n\n''ess\u00e9'' \"nine\"\n\n''g\u00f3ma'' \"ten\"\n\nThe multiples of ten are derived by shortening the first ten numbers.\n\n''g\u00f3 \"''ten, -teen\" (used in the numbers 11\u201319)\n\n''j\u00ec'' \"twenty\"\n\n''t\u00e1'' \"thirty\"\n\n''n\u00e0'' \"forty\"\n\n''s\u00e9n'' \"fifty\"\n\n''s\u00ed\u00ec'' \"sixty\"\n\n''s\u00e1'' \"seventy\"\n\n''s\u00e1t'' \"eighty\"\n\n''ss\u00e9'' \"ninety\"\n\nThe number multiples of one hundred are created by using the reduplicated ''gogo'' root. These numbers are not treated as compounds, unlike the number 11\u201399.\n\n''ej\u00ec g\u00f3g\u00f3'' \"two hundred\"\n\n''as\u00e1\u00e0 g\u00f3g\u00f3'' \"seven hundred\"\n\nThe [[Ordinal number|ordinal numbers]] are formed by using the preposition ''nke''.\n\n''nke d\u00e1y\u00e1'' \"first\"\n\n''nke s\u00e1\u00e8t\u00e1'' \"seventy third\"\n\n''nke'' ''as\u00e1\u00e0 g\u00f3g\u00f3'' \"seven hundredth\"\n\n==== Word Formation ====\n\nGuosa uses a couple particles to derive words from others. For example:\n\n''\u00f2'' - agent, person characterized by the root. In the plural, this is ''\u00e8''.\n\n* ''k\u00f3z\u00ed'' \"to teach\" \u2192 ''\u00f2 k\u00f3z\u00ed'' \"teacher\", ''\u00e8 k\u00f3z\u00ed'' \"teachers\"\n* ''gw\u00f9eb\u00ed'' \"hungry\" \u2192 ''\u00f2 gw\u00f9eb\u00ed'' \"hungry person\", ''\u00e8 gw\u00f9eb\u00ed'' \"hungry people\"\n* ''m\u00e1k\u00e1r\u00e1nt\u00e1'' \"school\" \u2192 ''\u00f2 m\u00e1k\u00e1r\u00e1nt\u00e1'' \"student\", ''\u00e8 m\u00e1k\u00e1r\u00e1nt\u00e1'' \"students\"\n\n''\u00ec'' - forms both the noun and adjective from a verbal or other noun root:\n\n* ''b\u00eds\u00ed'' \"to succeed\" \u2192 ''\u00ecb\u00eds\u00ed'' \"success, successful\"\n* ''k\u00f3z\u00ed'' \"to teach\" \u2192 ''\u00eck\u00f3z\u00ed'' \"lesson\"\n* ''r\u00f9sh\u00e9'' \"to work\" \u2192 ''\u00ecr\u00f9sh\u00e9'' \"work, labor\"\n* ''m\u00e1ch\u00e8'' \"woman\" \u2192 ''\u00ecm\u00e1ch\u00e8'' \"womanhood, womanly\"\n\nMuch of the word derivation in Guosa is done using just these two particles.\n\n=== Examples ===\n\n''b\u00eca k\u00e0 \u2018w\u00e1 j\u00e9 \u00e0b\u00ednch\u00ed.'' \n\n'come, let's eat food.'\n\n''\u00f2 ch\u00e8t\u00f3 \u00e1j\u00ec \u2018w\u00e1 sh\u00eceng\u00e1 la g\u00edd\u00e1.''

Additionally, several words were produced a priori via sound symbolism, e.g. meeh \"sheep\", yanmu-yanmu \"mosquito\", and wuam \"eat\".\n\nThe different parts of speech are often derived from specific languages. Most concrete nouns are derived from Hausa, while verbs and abstracts are derived from Igbo or Yoruba. Additionally, words from all three source languages are often fused to create a word that resembles all three. For example, the Guosa word ''m\u00e9ni'' \"what\" is derived from Hausa ''menini,'' Igbo ''gini,'' and Yoruba ''kini,'' all meaning \"what\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Igbin\u00e9w\u00e9k\u00e1|first=Alexander|date=31 January 2019|title=The Complete Dictionary of Guosa Language 2nd Revised Edition|url= |location=Bloomington, IN|publisher=iUniverse|page=|isbn=978-1-5320-6574-3|author-link=}}</ref>\n\n=== Phonology ===\n\nThe exact phonological values or amount of distinct phonemes in Guosa is unknown. It does, however, have a relatively large consonant inventory, as Guosa adopts several consonants that are featured in only a relatively small number of its source languages.\n\n==== Consonants ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | \n!

They almost exclusively appear in words with an English or other foreign source.\n# It is unknown exactly how many pre-nasalized stops are actually phonemes, and which, if any, are considered consonant clusters. Several do appear word initially in common words such as: ''ncha'' \"every\", ''nkami'' \"my\", ''mb\u00ed'' \"here\", ''njika'' \"evil\", ''ngate'' \"coast\", and ''ngb\u00e0'' \"time\". All other stops do appear with a preceding nasal word medially, but it is unclear if these are pre-nasalized stops or clusters of a nasal and a stop.\n# The rhotic is either a tap or a trill.\n# Syllabic consonants can appear as separate words, such as ng (present continuous marker). These always have the mid tone.\n# The plosives, nasals (/\u014b/ exempt), the fricatives (velars exempt), the approximants, and /d\u0292/ can be geminated, though minimal pairs are rare.\n# It is unknown if the palatal nasal is a phoneme or if it is simply the cluster /nj/.\n\n==== Vowels ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |&nbsp;\n! colspan=\"2\" |Short vowels\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Long vowels]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Nasal vowel|Nasal vowels]]\n|-\n![[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n!Front\n!Back\n!Front\n!Back\n|-\n![[Close vowel|Close]]\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|i}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|u}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|i\u02d0}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|u\u02d0}}\n| align=\"center\" |({{IPA|\u0129}})\n| align=\"center\" |({{IPA|\u0169}})\n|-\n![[Close-mid vowel|Close-mid]]\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|e}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|o}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|e\u02d0}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{IPA|o\u02d0}}\n| align=\"center\" |({{IPA|\u1ebd}})\n| align=\"center\" |({{IPA|\u00f5}})\n|-\n![[Open vowel|Open]]\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |{{IPA|a}}\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |{{IPA|a\u02d0}}\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |({{IPA|\u00e3}})\n|}\nThough Guosa once had the seven vowel system similar to that of Yoruba, the vowels\n/\u025b/ and /\u0254/ have seemingly been merged into their closed counterparts, giving Guosa a five vowel system. Vowels can be either long or short, but the functional load of vowel length appears to be light, however, as very few minimal pairs exist when tone is taken into account. There are nasal vowels written with an \u27e8n\u27e9 following a vowel, though this does not always indicate a nasal vowel. The functional load of these is also light and the vast majority of nasal vowels are short. No two words differ in both the nasality of the vowels and vowel length.\n\nIt is unknown if there are diphthongs in Guosa; all vowels could be pronounced as separate syllables, or several vowels could form diphthongs. The phonology of Yoruba, however, suggests that Guosa vowels do not form diphthongs, as almost all the words with adjacent vowels come from Yoruba, in which all vowels are pronounced separately. \n\n==== Tone ====\n\nThere are three basic [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] in Guosa: high, mid, and low; there are also two [[Tone contour|contour tones]]: low-rising and high-falling. Mid is left unmarked and is seemingly the default tone, high is written with an acute \u27e8\u25cc\u0301\u27e9, low with a grave \u27e8\u25cc\u0300\u27e9. On short vowels the low-rising is written with a caron \u27e8\u25cc\u030c\u27e9 and high-falling with a circumflex \u27e8\u25cc\u0302\u27e9. With long vowels, the contour tones are split across the two vowels. With long vowels, the contour tones are written as two separate diacritics.\n\n==== Elision ====\n\n[[Elision]] takes place when two of the same vowels would be adjacent, or with certain grammatical particles. For example, when the plural marker \u00e9 is placed before a word beginning with a vowel: ''\u00e9 \u00f3m\u00f3nt\u00e0k\u00e9l\u00e9'' \u2192 ''\u00e9m\u00f3nt\u00e0k\u00e9l\u00e9''  \"little children\". This elision can be written with an apostrophe when the two vowels are the same: ''ji inang'' \u2192 ''ji'nang'' \"twenty four\". It can also be written as an apostrophe when the elision spans two words that are not particles: ''s\u00f2ng\u00ed \u00ecs\u00f3ng\u00e0'' \u2192 ''s\u00f2ng\u00ed 's\u00f3ng\u00e0'' \"sing a song\".\n\n==== Phonotactics ====\nA syllable in Guosa is generally of the form (C)(A)V(C), though more specialized loanwords may have the structure (C)(C)(C)V(C).\n\n=== Orthography ===\n\nThe Guosa alphabet contains 23 single letters, and several [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. The letters \u27e8q\u27e9 and \u27e8x\u27e9 are not used, and the letter \u27e8c\u27e9 only appears in the digraph \u27e8ch\u27e9. There used to be two vowel letters that seem to have almost completely disappeared from the current draft of the language: \u27e8\u1eb9\u27e9 and \u27e8\u1ecd\u27e9. Other than these abandoned letters, diacritics are only used to mark the tone of vowels. The digraph \u27e8ng\u27e9 represents /\u1d51g/ word-initially and possibly word-medially, but word-finally it represents /\u014b/\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Letter\n!

Most grammatical meaning is expressed through [[Grammatical particle|particles]] that precede the words they modify, such as ''\u00e9'' (plural), ''ng'' ([[Present continuous|present progressive]]), ''l\u00e1'' ([[perfective aspect]]), and ''k\u00e0'' ([[Volitive modality|volitive]]). There are no articles. Adjectives follow the noun. There is no grammatical gender or noun class system. Guosa is generally prepositional. \n\n==== Pronouns ====\nSome Guosa pronouns, unlike the rest of the words in the language, change depending on whether they are the subject or object. [[Animacy]] is not distinguished in pronouns, but plural is, and gender is distinguishable, albeit it is optional and only makes the distinction between female and male/neuter. The following is a known list of pronouns. Some of them are defined ambiguously, so the exact pronouns are unknown.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!subject\n!object/genitive\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |first person singular\n|'''m\u00f2''' (I)\n|'''m\u00ed''' (me/mine)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |second person singular\n|'''o''' (you, thou)\n|'''y\u00edn''' (you/your, thee/thy)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |third\nperson singular\n!masculine/neuter\n|'''\u00f3''' (he, it)\n|'''ya''' (him/his, it/its)\n|-\n!feminine\n|'''ta''' (she)\n|'''ta''' (she/her)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |first person plural\n|'''\u00e0w\u00e1''' (we)\n|'''<nowiki/>'w\u00e1, kew\u00e1''' (us/our)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |second person plural\n|'''ee''' (you all)\n|'''\u00e9y\u00edn''' (you all/all of your)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |third person plural\n|'''ha, fa, su''' (they)\n|'''ha, fa, su''' (they, them)\n|}\nAn intensive form of the pronoun us created by affixing the suffix ''-wan''. Though possessive is often indicated by simply having the object form of the pronoun follow the noun, the preposition ''nke'' \"of\" can be used to indicate unambiguous possession.\n\n==== Descriptors ====\nAdjectives and adverbs are not separate classes in Guosa and are jointly called descriptors, following whatever they modify. Some descriptors only act as adjectives or adverbs, however.\n\nIn Guosa there are four regular degrees of comparison. The word ''j\u00f9'' \"more\" is used to form a comparative from an adjective: ''r\u00e1m\u00e1'' \"good\" \u2192 ''r\u00e1m\u00e1 j\u00f9'' \"better\". The superlative simply combines the adverb ''kh\u00e0'' \"very\" with ''j\u00f9'': ''r\u00e1m\u00e1 j\u00f9 kh\u00e0'' \"best\" (lit. very more good). Finally, there is a forth degree of comparison above superlative. Though the superlative might indicate the highest of value in a certain group, the degree indicated by the category higher than the superlative shows that the indicated noun is the absolute best in its entire category; this is done with the ''kh\u00e0k\u00e1a'': ''rubi'' \"bad\" \u2192 ''rubi'' ''j\u00f9 kh\u00e0k\u00e1a'' \"the very worst\".\n\n==== Verbs ====\nIn Guosa, all verbs have one form; there is no conjugation. There is a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], ''w\u00f9'', but it is only used with a predicate noun. With predicate adjectives however, ''w\u00f9'' is not used, and the adjective behaves more like a verb. Compare the sentences ''m\u00f2 w\u00f9 m\u00e1mb\u00e9z\u00e8'' \"I am a king\" with ''m\u00f2 r\u00e1m\u00e1'' \"I am well\". \n\nThere are several particles that modify the tense, aspect, and mood of verbs. These particles usually precede the verbs they modify, but the particle l\u00e1 follows the verb instead.<ref>{{cite book |last=Igbin\u00e9w\u00e9k\u00e1|first=Alexander|date=1999|title=Teach Yourself Guosa Language Book 2: Nigeria\u2019s future common indigenous lingua franca|url= |location=Richmond, CA |publisher=Guosa Publication Services|page= |isbn= |author-link=}}</ref>\n\n* ''ng'' (present continual): ''m\u00f3 s\u00f2ng\u00ed 's\u00f3ng\u00e0'' \"I sing a song\" \u2192 ''m\u00f3 ng s\u00f2ng\u00ed 's\u00f3ng\u00e0'' \"I am singing a song\"\n\n* ''t\u00ed'' (perfect): ''m\u00f2 j\u00f2nd\u00fa'' \"I sit\" \u2192 ''m\u00f2 t\u00ed j\u00f2nd\u00fa'' \"I have sat\"\n\nThe particle l\u00e1 is used in a slightly different way, creating an adjective that functions similarity to an active past participle. This form can also take a direct object.\n\n* ''m\u00f3 k\u00f9nd\u00e9'' \"I wake up\"  \u2192 ''m\u00f3 k\u00f9nd\u00e9 l\u00e1'' \"I am awake\"\n\n==== Prepositions ====\n\n==== Numerals ====\nGuosa has a [[Decimal|base ten]] number system. The cardinal [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] are:\n\n''d\u00e1y\u00e1'' \"one\"\n\n''ej\u00ec'' \"two\"\n\n''\u00e8t\u00e1'' \"three\"\n\n''\u00ecn\u00e0ng'' \"four\"\n\n''\u00ecs\u00e9n'' \"five\"\n\n''\u00ecs\u00ed\u00ec'' \"six\"\n\n''as\u00e1\u00e0'' \"seven\"\n\n''as\u00e1to'' \"eight\"\n\n''ess\u00e9'' \"nine\"\n\n''g\u00f3ma'' \"ten\"\n\nThe multiples of ten are derived by shortening the first ten numbers.\n\n''g\u00f3 \"''ten, -teen\" (used in the numbers 11\u201319)\n\n''j\u00ec'' \"twenty\"\n\n''t\u00e1'' \"thirty\"\n\n''n\u00e0'' \"forty\"\n\n''s\u00e9n'' \"fifty\"\n\n''s\u00ed\u00ec'' \"sixty\"\n\n''s\u00e1'' \"seventy\"\n\n''s\u00e1t'' \"eighty\"\n\n''ss\u00e9'' \"ninety\"\n\nThe number multiples of one hundred are created by using the reduplicated ''gogo'' root. These numbers are not treated as compounds, unlike the number 11\u201399.\n\n''ej\u00ec g\u00f3g\u00f3'' \"two hundred\"\n\n''as\u00e1\u00e0 g\u00f3g\u00f3'' \"seven hundred\"\n\nThe [[Ordinal number|ordinal numbers]] are formed by using the preposition ''nke''.\n\n''nke d\u00e1y\u00e1'' \"first\"\n\n''nke s\u00e1\u00e8t\u00e1'' \"seventy third\"\n\n''nke'' ''as\u00e1\u00e0 g\u00f3g\u00f3'' \"seven hundredth\"\n\n==== Word Formation ====\n\nGuosa uses a couple particles to derive words from others. For example:\n\n''\u00f2'' - agent, person characterized by the root. In the plural, this is ''\u00e8''.\n\n* ''k\u00f3z\u00ed'' \"to teach\" \u2192 ''\u00f2 k\u00f3z\u00ed'' \"teacher\", ''\u00e8 k\u00f3z\u00ed'' \"teachers\"\n* ''gw\u00f9eb\u00ed'' \"hungry\" \u2192 ''\u00f2 gw\u00f9eb\u00ed'' \"hungry person\", ''\u00e8 gw\u00f9eb\u00ed'' \"hungry people\"\n* ''m\u00e1k\u00e1r\u00e1nt\u00e1'' \"school\" \u2192 ''\u00f2 m\u00e1k\u00e1r\u00e1nt\u00e1'' \"student\", ''\u00e8 m\u00e1k\u00e1r\u00e1nt\u00e1'' \"students\"\n\n''\u00ec'' - forms both the noun and adjective from a verbal or other noun root:\n\n* ''b\u00eds\u00ed'' \"to succeed\" \u2192 ''\u00ecb\u00eds\u00ed'' \"success, successful\"\n* ''k\u00f3z\u00ed'' \"to teach\" \u2192 ''\u00eck\u00f3z\u00ed'' \"lesson\"\n* ''r\u00f9sh\u00e9'' \"to work\" \u2192 ''\u00ecr\u00f9sh\u00e9'' \"work, labor\"\n* ''m\u00e1ch\u00e8'' \"woman\" \u2192 ''\u00ecm\u00e1ch\u00e8'' \"womanhood, womanly\"\n\nMuch of the word derivation in Guosa is done using just these two particles.\n\n=== Examples ===\n\n''b\u00eca k\u00e0 \u2018w\u00e1 j\u00e9 \u00e0b\u00ednch\u00ed.'' \n\n'come, let's eat food.'\n\n''\u00f2 ch\u00e8t\u00f3 \u00e1j\u00ec \u2018w\u00e1 sh\u00eceng\u00e1 la g\u00edd\u00e1.''

In 1966, at age 17, he immigrated to Israel, and continued his Torah studies.\n\nLitzman is married, has five children, and lives in Jerusalem. He is quoted as saying that, \"in some respects, I envy the low profile the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] community in the United States has been able to retain by staying out of politics\".

He became active in politics under the guidance of the then-Gerrer [[Rebbe]], [[Rabbi]] [[Simcha Binem Alter]]. Over time, he became known as the rebbe's right-hand man, a role he continues under the present Gerrer Rebbe, Rabbi [[Yaakov Arye Alter]]. In 1999, the present rebbe asked Litzman to join the Agudat Yisrael faction of the United Torah Judaism list for the [[1999 Israeli legislative election|Knesset elections]] that year. He was subsequently elected, and became Chairman of the Finance Committee. He headed the UTJ list for the [[2003 Israeli legislative election|2003 elections]],<ref>[http://en.idi.org.il/media/394109/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94%2016.pdf UTJ list] Israel Democracy Institute</ref> and was re-elected, again becoming the Chair of the Finance Committee.

A bill restricting the marketing of tobacco was finally agreed upon after other MKs threatened to vote against a bill restricting retail operations on Shabbat and Jewish religious holidays.

In 1966, at age 17, he immigrated to Israel, and continued his Torah studies.\n\nLitzman is married, has five children, and lives in Jerusalem. He is quoted as saying that, \"in some respects, I envy the low profile the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] community in the United States has been able to retain by staying out of politics\". He also said that, in Israel, the media attention makes for misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the Haredi community.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Brooklyn-bred Hasid Takes Position of Power in Israel| url=http://www.forward.com/articles/brooklyn-bred-hasid-takes-position-of-power-in-isr/| publisher=Forward, the Jewish Daily| last=Popper| first=Nathaniel| date=28 January 2005| accessdate=17 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225906/http://www.forward.com/articles/brooklyn-bred-hasid-takes-position-of-power-in-isr/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 26 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHis first job was as principal of the Hasidic [[Beis Yaakov]] girls' school in [[Jerusalem]].

Over time, he became known as the rebbe's right-hand man, a role he continues under the present Gerrer Rebbe, Rabbi [[Yaakov Arye Alter]]. In 1999, the present rebbe asked Litzman to join the Agudat Yisrael faction of the United Torah Judaism list for the [[1999 Israeli legislative election|Knesset elections]] that year. He was subsequently elected, and became Chairman of the Finance Committee. He headed the UTJ list for the [[2003 Israeli legislative election|2003 elections]],<ref>[http://en.idi.org.il/media/394109/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94%2016.pdf UTJ list] Israel Democracy Institute</ref> and was re-elected, again becoming the Chair of the Finance Committee.
