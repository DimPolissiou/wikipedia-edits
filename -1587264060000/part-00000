This does not rely upon [[unspent transaction outputs]] (UTXOs). The state denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. The state is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate [[Merkle tree|Merkle]] Patricia tree. A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private \"keys\"]] or \"addresses\" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 \"HD Wallet\". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.\n\nTo send ether to an account, you need the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash of the public key of that account.

In 2017, mining generated 9.2 million new ether, corresponding to a 10% increase in its total supply.

Smart contracts are [[High-level programming language|high-level]] programming [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstractions]] that are compiled down to EVM [[bytecode]] and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for execution. They can be written in [[Solidity]] (a language library with similarities to [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[JavaScript]]), Serpent (similar to [[Python (programming language)|Python]], but deprecated), LLL (a [[Low-level programming language|low-level]] [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]-like language), and Mutan ([[Go (programming language)|Go]]-based, but deprecated). There is also a research-oriented language under development called Vyper (a [[Strong and weak typing|strongly-typed]] [[Python (programming language)|Python]]-derived [[Recursive language|decidable language]]).\n\nSmart contracts can be public, which opens up the possibility to prove functionality, e.g. self-contained [[provably fair]] casinos.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Piasecki |first=Piotr J. |year=2016 |title=Gaming Self-Contained Provably Fair Smart Contract Casinos |url=http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/29 |journal=[[Ledger (journal)|Ledger]] |volume=1 |pages=99\u2013110 |doi=10.5195/ledger.2016.29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224031048/http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/29 |archivedate=24 December 2016 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nOne issue related to using smart contracts on a public blockchain is that bugs, including security holes, are visible to all but cannot be fixed quickly.<ref name=\"Peck20160528\">{{cite web |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/ethereums-150-million-dollar-dao-opens-for-business-just-as-researchers-call-for-a-moratorium |title=Ethereum's $150-Million Blockchain-Powered Fund Opens Just as Researchers Call For a Halt |first=M. |last=Peck |date=28 May 2016 |work=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530202345/https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/ethereums-150-million-dollar-dao-opens-for-business-just-as-researchers-call-for-a-moratorium |archivedate=30 May 2016 }}</ref> One example of this is the 17 June 2016 attack on The DAO, which could not be quickly stopped or reversed.<ref name=\"NYTDAOHACK\" />\n\nThere is ongoing research on how to use formal verification to express and prove non-trivial properties.

This does not rely upon [[unspent transaction outputs]] (UTXOs). The state denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. The state is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate [[Merkle tree|Merkle]] Patricia tree. A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private \"keys\"]] or \"addresses\" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 \"HD Wallet\". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.\n\nTo send ether to an account, you need the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash of the public key of that account.

In 2017, mining generated 9.2 million new ether, corresponding to a 10% increase in its total supply. Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG), which is a hybrid Proof of Work and Proof of Stake scheme, and Casper Correct-By-Construction (CBC), a separate Proof of Stake design of Casper, are expected to reduce the inflation rate to between 0.5% to 2%.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} There is no currently implemented hard cap on the total supply of ETH.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/06/11/ethereums-total-supply/|title=Ethereum's supply has crossed 100M, here's what that means|last=Varshney|first=Neer|date=11 June 2018|website=Hard Fork {{!}} The Next Web|language=en-us|access-date=25 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Markets and stores===\nEther can be traded by regular currency [[brokers]], [[cryptocurrency exchanges]], as well as many online [[cryptocurrency wallet]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/fans-of-digital-currency-ether-can-now-buy-etns-in-sweden|title=Fans of Digital Currency Ether Can Now Buy ETNs\u2014In Sweden|author=Olga Kharif|date=11 October 2017|website=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]}}</ref>\n\n== Platform ==\n\n=== Virtual Machine ===\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.
