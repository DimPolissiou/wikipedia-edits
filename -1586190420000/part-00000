They completed more than 50 projects in [[Turkey]] during the [[Tanzimat]] era. They belonged to the [[Morcote]] branch of the Fossati, a prominent [[Ticino|Ticinese]] family with mentions in the historical record going back to the 14th century. Gaspari was a superb draftsman, and a master of renovations. He is most noted for his renovation of the Hagia Sofia in Constantinople, which virtually saved it from destruction.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Ticino]], Gaspari and Giuseppe Fossati were born into a notable family of artisans from Morcote in the Ticino region. Their ancestors included architects, artists and engineers.<ref>{{HDS|23516|Fossati|author=|date=|rm=}}</ref>\n\nThe brothers finished primary and middle school in [[Venice]] and studied architecture at the [[Brera Academy]] in [[Milan]]. During his period at the Academy, Gaspari won many prizes. Between 1829 and 1831, Gaspare produced many lithographs of Rome, and produced a catalogue for Leon XII. In around 1833, Gasapari began working for the architectural team of [[Luigi Rusca]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], and in 1837, he married Rusca's daughter. (Rusca had died in 1822, but his nephew carried on with Rusca's projects in Saint Petersburg.)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121025195421/http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.jsp?document_id=4955 \"Gaspare Fossati di Morcote and his Brother Giuseppe,\" in ''Environmental Design: Presence of Italy in the Architecture of the Islamic Meditterranean,''by G. Goodwin]</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1836, Gaspare was appointed to [[Constantinople]] (modern-day [[Istanbul]]), becoming the official court architect and agreed to draw up plans for the Russian Embassy in Constantinople. He recruited his brother-in-law, Alessandro Rusca, and his own 17 year old brother, Guissepe Fossati. He set sail from Odessa, arriving in Constantinople on 20 March 1837.  The Fossati brothers' time in Constantinople would mark the beginning of a very productiver period, and Gaspare would enjoy a distinguished career there.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121025195421/http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.jsp?document_id=4955 \"Gaspare Fossati di Morcote and his Brother Giuseppe,\" in  ''Environmental Design: Presence of Italy in the Architecture of the Islamic Meditterranean,''by G. Goodwin]</ref>\n\nBetween 1841 and 1843, the Fossati brothers built the brick [[Bab-\u0131 Seraskeri]] Hospital ([[Bekira\u011fa B\u00f6l\u00fc\u011f\u00fc]]) and [[Liman \u0130skelesi Karakolu]] in [[Emin\u00f6n\u00fc]] for the Ottoman Administration. They were appointed to renovate [[Arzuodas\u0131 at Bab\u0131ali]] in 1844, and to build important buildings in [[Sultanahmet, Fatih|Sultanahmet]] such as [[D\u00e2r\u00fclf\u00fcnun]] (university) (1845-1846), [[Hazine-i Evrak]], and [[Mekteb-i Sanayi]] (1846-1848).

They completed the restoration in two years, utilizing more than eight hundred workers. They were able to document a larger number of Byzantine mosaics whose precise location within the Hagia Sophia today have not been fully documented since many were either painted over or destroyed often without recording their original location. The drawings of the Hagia Sophia mosaics are kept in the Cantonal Archive of Ticino.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/047933-000/monuments-eternels |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505015235/http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/047933-000/monuments-eternels |archivedate=2015-05-05 }}</ref> Sultan [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]] allowed the brothers to also document any mosaics they might discover during this process which were later archived in Swiss libraries.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlkkLNd4P44 Hagia Sophia. Nova PBS program; originally aired 2/25/2015]</ref>\n\nThe [[Telgrafhane-i Amire]] building was built by Giuseppe Fossati in 1855. Upon the death of [[Re\u015fit Pa\u015fa]] in 1858, the Fossati brothers built his mausoleum in the corner of the graveyard in the [[Bayezid II Mosque, Istanbul|Bayezit]] complex. They also renovated [[Venedik Palace]] (today the house of the Italian Ambassador) in 1853, and the Dutch Embassy in [[Beyo\u011flu]] in 1854.  They built the Spanish (1854) and Iranian (1856) embassies in Istanbul and the Ottomon University, adjacent to the Hagia Sofia. In addition, they built three Italian theaters. One of them was the [[Naum Theatre]], which was built in [[Galatasaray]] in 1846, and destroyed by a fire in 1870.\n\nIn 1858, the Fossati brothers returned to Switzerland.

They completed more than 50 projects in [[Turkey]] during the [[Tanzimat]] era. They belonged to the [[Morcote]] branch of the Fossati, a prominent [[Ticino|Ticinese]] family with mentions in the historical record going back to the 14th century. Gaspari was a superb draftsman, and a master of renovations. He is most noted for his renovation of the Hagia Sofia in Constantinople, which virtually saved it from destruction.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Ticino]], Gaspari and Giuseppe Fossati were born into a notable family of artisans from Morcote in the Ticino region. Their ancestors included architects, artists and engineers.<ref>{{HDS|23516|Fossati|author=|date=|rm=}}</ref>\n\nThe brothers finished primary and middle school in [[Venice]] and studied architecture at the [[Brera Academy]] in [[Milan]]. During his period at the Academy, Gaspari won many prizes. Between 1829 and 1831, Gaspare produced many lithographs of Rome, and produced a catalogue for Leon XII. In around 1833, Gasapari began working for the architectural team of [[Luigi Rusca]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], and in 1837, he married Rusca's daughter. (Rusca had died in 1822, but his nephew carried on with Rusca's projects in Saint Petersburg.)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121025195421/http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.jsp?document_id=4955 \"Gaspare Fossati di Morcote and his Brother Giuseppe,\" in ''Environmental Design: Presence of Italy in the Architecture of the Islamic Meditterranean,''by G. Goodwin]</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1836, Gaspare was appointed to [[Constantinople]] (modern-day [[Istanbul]]), becoming the official court architect and agreed to draw up plans for the Russian Embassy in Constantinople. He recruited his brother-in-law, Alessandro Rusca, and his own 17 year old brother, Guissepe Fossati. He set sail from Odessa, arriving in Constantinople on 20 March 1837.  The Fossati brothers' time in Constantinople would mark the beginning of a very productiver period, and Gaspare would enjoy a distinguished career there.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121025195421/http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.jsp?document_id=4955 \"Gaspare Fossati di Morcote and his Brother Giuseppe,\" in  ''Environmental Design: Presence of Italy in the Architecture of the Islamic Meditterranean,''by G.

They were appointed to renovate [[Arzuodas\u0131 at Bab\u0131ali]] in 1844, and to build important buildings in [[Sultanahmet, Fatih|Sultanahmet]] such as [[D\u00e2r\u00fclf\u00fcnun]] (university) (1845-1846), [[Hazine-i Evrak]], and [[Mekteb-i Sanayi]] (1846-1848).

They completed the restoration in two years, utilizing more than eight hundred workers. They were able to document a larger number of Byzantine mosaics whose precise location within the Hagia Sophia today have not been fully documented since many were either painted over or destroyed often without recording their original location. The drawings of the Hagia Sophia mosaics are kept in the Cantonal Archive of Ticino.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/047933-000/monuments-eternels |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505015235/http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/047933-000/monuments-eternels |archivedate=2015-05-05 }}</ref> Sultan [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]] allowed the brothers to also document any mosaics they might discover during this process which were later archived in Swiss libraries.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlkkLNd4P44 Hagia Sophia.

Upon the death of [[Re\u015fit Pa\u015fa]] in 1858, the Fossati brothers built his mausoleum in the corner of the graveyard in the [[Bayezid II Mosque|Bayezit]] complex. They also renovated [[Venedik Palace]] (today the house of the Italian Ambassador) in 1853, and the Dutch Embassy in [[Beyo\u011flu]] in 1854.  They built the Spanish (1854) and Iranian (1856) embassies in Istanbul and the Ottomon University, adjacent to the Hagia Sofia. In addition, they built three Italian theaters. One of them was the [[Naum Theatre]], which was built in [[Galatasaray]] in 1846, and destroyed by a fire in 1870.\n\nIn 1858, the Fossati brothers returned to Switzerland.  They built their homes in Morcote in the Turkish style.

{"title_page": "History of Wisconsin", "text_new": "The '''history of Wisconsin''' encompasses the story not only of the people who have lived in [[Wisconsin]] since it became a state of the U.S., but also that of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes who made their homeland in Wisconsin, the French and British colonists who were the first Europeans to live there, and the American settlers who lived in Wisconsin when it was a territory. Since its admission to the Union on May 29, 1848 as 30th state, Wisconsin has been ethnically heterogeneous, with [[Yankee]]s being among the first to arrive from New York and New England. They dominated the state's heavy industry, finance, politics and education. Large numbers of European immigrants followed them, including [[German American]]s, mostly between 1850 and 1900, Scandinavians (the largest group being [[Norwegian Americans]]) and smaller groups of [[Belgian American]]s, [[Dutch American]]s, [[Swiss American]]s, [[Finnish American]]s, [[Irish American]]s and others; in the 20th century, large numbers of [[Polish American]]s and [[African American]]s came, settling mainly in Milwaukee. Politically the state was predominantly Republican until recent years, when it became more evenly balanced. The state took a national leadership role in the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive Movement]], under the aegis of [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]] and his family, who fought the old guard bitterly at the state and national levels. The \"[[Wisconsin Idea]]\" called for the use of the higher learning in modernizing government, and the state is notable for its strong network of state universities.\n\n==Pre-Columbian history==\n[[File:SimplifiedPealeMastodon.jpg|thumb|300px|Drawing of a mastodon skeleton by [[Rembrandt Peale]]]]\nThe first known inhabitants of what is now Wisconsin were [[Paleo-Indians]], who first arrived in the region in about 10,000 BC at the end of the [[Last glacial period|Ice Age]]. The retreating glaciers left behind a tundra in Wisconsin inhabited by large animals, such as [[mammoth]]s, [[mastodon]]s, [[bison]], [[Castoroides|giant beaver]], and [[muskox]]. The [[Boaz mastodon]] and the [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] artifacts discovered in [[Boaz, Wisconsin]] show that the Paleo-Indians hunted these large animals. They also gathered plants as conifer forests grew in the glaciers' wake. With the decline and extinction of many large mammals in the Americas, the Paleo-Indian diet shifted toward smaller mammals like deer and bison.<ref>Milwaukee Public Museum. \"[https://www.mpm.edu/wirp/ICW-22.html#paleo Paleo-Indians (10000 BC-8500 BC)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921101610/https://www.mpm.edu/wirp/ICW-22.html#paleo |date=2016-09-21 }}\".</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic Period]], from 6000\u20131000 BC, mixed conifer-hardwood forests as well as mixed prairie-forests replaced Wisconsin's conifer forests. People continued to depend on hunting and gathering. Around 4000 BC they developed [[spear-thrower]]s and [[Old Copper Complex|copper tools]] such as axes, [[adze]]s, projectile points, knives, perforators, fishhooks and harpoons. Copper ornaments like beaded necklaces also appeared around 1500 BC. These people gathered copper ore at quarries on the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] in Michigan and on [[Isle Royale]] in Lake Superior. They may have crafted copper artifacts by hammering and folding the metal and also by heating it to increase its malleability. However it is not certain if these people reached the level of copper [[smelting]].<ref>Milwaukee Public Museum. \"[https://www.mpm.edu/research-collections/anthropology/online-collections-research/old-copper-culture Old Copper Culture]\".</ref> Regardless, the Copper Culture of the Great Lakes region reached a level of sophistication unprecedented in North America.

Small scale agriculture and pottery arrived in southern Wisconsin at this time. The primary crops were maize, beans and squash. Agriculture, however, could not sufficiently support these people, who also had to hunt and gather. Agriculture at this time was more akin to gardening than to farming.<ref>Mississippi Valley Archaeology Center. \"[http://mvac.uwlax.edu/PreEuropeanPeople/wood_food.html Food: Hunting, Gathering and Gardening]\".</ref> Villages emerged along rivers, streams and lakes, and the earliest [[Mound Builders|earthen burial mounds]] were constructed.<ref>Milwaukee Public Museum. \"[https://www.mpm.edu/wirp/ICW-22.html#ewoodland Early Woodland (1000 BC-300 BC)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921101610/https://www.mpm.edu/wirp/ICW-22.html#ewoodland |date=2016-09-21 }}\".</ref> The [[Hopewell tradition|Havana Hopewell Culture]] arrived in Wisconsin in the Middle Woodland Period, settling along the Mississippi River.

A rectangular wood-and-clay stockade surrounded the twenty acre site, which contained two large earthen mounds and a central plaza. One mound may have been used for food storage, as a residence for high-ranking officials, or as a temple, and the other may have been used as a mortuary. The Mississippian Culture cultivated maize intensively, and their fields probably stretched far beyond the stockade at Aztalan, although modern agriculture has erased any traces of Mississippian practices in the area. Some rumors also speculate that the people of Aztalan may have experimented slightly with stone architecture in the making of a man-made, stone-line pond, at the very least.

They returned to Wisconsin in 1659\u20131660, this time at [[Chequamegon Bay]] on Lake Superior. On their second voyage they found that the [[Ojibwe]] had expanded into northern Wisconsin, as they continued to prosper in the fur trade. They also were the first Europeans to contact the Santee Dakota. They built a trading post and wintered near [[Ashland, Wisconsin|Ashland]], before returning to Montreal.\n\nIn 1665 [[Claude-Jean Allouez]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary, built a mission on Lake Superior. Five years later he abandoned the mission, and journeyed to ''La Baie des Puants''. Two years later he built [[St. Francis Xavier Mission]] near present-day [[De Pere, Wisconsin|De Pere]]. In his journeys through Wisconsin, he encountered groups of Native Americans who had been displaced by Iroquois in the Beaver Wars. He evangelized the Algonquin-speaking [[Potawatomi]], who had settled on the [[Door Peninsula]] after fleeing Iroquois attacks in Michigan. He also encountered the Algonquin-speaking [[Sauk people|Sauk]], who had been forced into Michigan by the Iroquois, and then had been forced into central Wisconsin by the Ojibwe and the Huron.\n\nThe next major expedition into Wisconsin was that of Father [[Jacques Marquette]] and [[Louis Jolliet]] in 1673. After hearing rumors from Indians telling of the existence of the [[Mississippi River]], Marquette and Joliet set out from [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace]], in what is now Michigan, and entered the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]] at Green Bay. They canoed up the Fox until they reached the river's westernmost point, and then portaged, or carried their boats, to the nearby [[Wisconsin River]], where they resumed canoeing downstream to the Mississippi River. Marquette and Joliet reached the Mississippi near what is now [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]] in June, 1673.<ref>{{cite web|title=Turning Points in Wisconsin History: Arrival of the First Europeans|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-006/?action=more_essay|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wisconsin in 1718.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Wisconsin in 1718, [[Guillaume de L'Isle]] map, approximate state area highlighted.]]\n\n[[Nicolas Perrot]], French commander of the west, established Fort St. Nicholas at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin in May, 1685, near the southwest end of the [[Fox-Wisconsin Waterway]].

Like the French, the British were interested in little but the fur trade. One notable event in the fur trading industry in Wisconsin occurred in 1791, when two free African Americans set up a fur trading post among the Menominee at present day [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]]. The first permanent settlers, mostly [[French Canadian]]s, some Anglo-New Englanders and a few African American freedmen, arrived in Wisconsin while it was under British control. [[Charles Michel de Langlade]] is generally recognized as the first settler, establishing a trading post at Green Bay in 1745, and moving there permanently in 1764.<ref>\"Langlade, Charles Michel 1729\u20131801,\" ''Dictionary of Wisconsin Biography''http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2266&search_term=langlade</ref> In 1766 the Royal Governor of the new territory, [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Robert Rogers]], engaged [[Jonathan Carver]] to explore and map the newly acquired territories for the Crown, and to search for a possible [[Northwest Passage]]. Carver left [[Fort Michilimackinac]] that spring and spent the next three years exploring and mapping what is now Wisconsin and parts of Minnesota.\n\nSettlement began at Prairie du Chien around 1781. The French residents at the trading post in what is now Green Bay, referred to the town as \"La Bey\", however British fur traders referred to it as \"Green Bay\", because the water and the shore assumed green tints in early spring. The old French title was gradually dropped, and the British name of \"Green Bay\" eventually stuck. The region coming under British rule had virtually no adverse effect on the French residents as the British needed the cooperation of the French fur traders and the French fur traders needed the goodwill of the British. During the French occupation of the region licenses for fur trading had been issued scarcely and only to select groups of traders, whereas the British, in an effort to make as much money as possible from the region, issued licenses for fur trading freely, both to British and French residents. The fur trade in what is now Wisconsin reached its height under British rule, and the first self-sustaining farms in the state were established at this time as well. From 1763 to 1780, Green Bay was a prosperous community which produced its own foodstuff, built graceful cottages and held dances and festivities.<ref>''Wisconsin, a Guide to the Badger State'' page 188</ref>\n\n==The territorial period==\nThe United States acquired Wisconsin in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]]. [[Massachusetts]] claimed the territory east of the Mississippi River between the present-day Wisconsin-Illinois border and present-day [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]]. [[Virginia]] claimed the territory north of La Crosse to Lake Superior and all of present-day Minnesota east of the Mississippi River. Shortly afterward, in 1787, the Americans made Wisconsin part of the new [[Northwest Territory]]. Later, in 1800, Wisconsin became part of [[Indiana Territory]]. Despite the fact that Wisconsin belonged to the United States at this time, the British continued to control the local fur trade and maintain military alliances with Wisconsin Indians.\n\n===The War of 1812 and the Indian wars===\n[[File:Chief Black Hawk3.jpg|left|160px|thumb|Chief Black Hawk, from [[History of the Indian Tribes of North America]].]]\n\nThe United States did not firmly exercise control over Wisconsin until the [[War of 1812]]. In 1814, the Americans built [[Fort Shelby (Wisconsin)|Fort Shelby]] at Prairie du Chien. During the war, the Americans and British fought one battle in Wisconsin, the July, 1814 [[Siege of Prairie du Chien]], which ended as a British victory. The British captured Fort Shelby and renamed it Fort McKay, after Major [[William McKay]], the British commander who led the forces that won the Battle of Prairie du Chien. However, the 1815 [[Treaty of Ghent]] reaffirmed American jurisdiction over Wisconsin, which was by then a part of [[Illinois Territory]]. Following the treaty, British troops burned Fort McKay, rather than giving it back to the Americans, and departed Wisconsin.<ref>http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whi/fullRecord.asp?id=42229</ref> To protect Prairie du Chien from future attacks, the United States Army constructed [[Fort Crawford]] in 1816, on the same site as Fort Shelby.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortcrawfordmuseum.com/history.html|title=History|author=|date=|website=Fort Crawford Museum|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref> [[Fort Howard (Wisconsin)|Fort Howard]] was also built in 1816 in Green Bay.<ref>http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/archaeology/forts.asp</ref>\n\nSignificant American settlement in Wisconsin, a part of [[Michigan Territory]] beginning in 1818, was delayed by two Indian wars, the minor [[Winnebago War]] of 1827 and the larger [[Black Hawk War]] of 1832.\n\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; clear:right;\"\n|-\n| {{Black Hawk War Map}}\n|-\n|Map of Black Hawk War sites<br />[[File:Red Battle X.png|8px]] <small>Battle (with name)</small> [[File:Red pog.svg|7px]] <small>Fort / settlement</small> [[File:Green pog.svg|7px]] <small>Native village</small><br /><small>Symbols are wikilinked to article</small>\n|}\n\n====The Winnebago War====\nThe Winnebago War started when, in 1826, two Winnebago men were detained at Fort Crawford on charges of murder and then transferred to [[Fort Snelling]] in present-day Minnesota. The Winnebago in the area believed that both men had been executed. On June 27, 1827, a Winnebago war band led by Chief [[Red Bird]] and the prophet [[Wabokieshiek|White Cloud]] (Wabokieshiek) attacked a family of settlers outside of Prairie du Chien, killing two men. They then went on to attack two keel-boats on the Mississippi River that were heading toward Fort Snelling, killing two men and injuring four more. Seven Winnebago warriors were killed in those attacks. The war band also attacked settlers on the lower Wisconsin River and the lead mines at [[Galena, Illinois]]. The war band surrendered at [[Portage, Wisconsin]], rather than fighting the United States Army that was pursuing them.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Crawford and Richland Counties, Wisconsin|publisher=Union Publishing Co.|location=Springfield, Ill.|year=1884|volume=1|chapter=Chapter 6|url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/wch&CISOPTR=18156&REC=1|accessdate=2009-11-15}}</ref>\n\n====The Black Hawk War====\nIn the Black Hawk War, Sac, Fox, and [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] Native Americans, otherwise known as the British Band, led by [[Black Hawk (chief)|Chief Black Hawk]], who had been relocated from Illinois to Iowa, attempted to resettle in their Illinois homeland on April 5, 1832, in violation of Treaty. On May 10 Chief Black Hawk decided to go back to Iowa. On May 14, Black Hawk's forces met with a group of militia men led by [[Isaiah Stillman]]. All three members of Black Hawk's parley were shot and one was killed. The [[Battle of Stillman's Run]] ensued, leaving twelve militia men and three to five Sac and Fox warriors dead. Of the fifteen battles of the war, six took place in Wisconsin. The other nine as well as several smaller skirmishes took place in Illinois. The first confrontation to take place in Wisconsin was the first [[Attacks at Fort Blue Mounds|attack on Fort Blue Mounds]] on June 6, in which one member of the local militia was killed outside of the fort. There was also the [[Spafford Farm Massacre]] on June 14, the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1832)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] on June 16, which was a United States victory, the second attack on Fort Blue Mounds on June 20, and the [[Sinsinawa Mound raid]] on June 29. The Native Americans were defeated at the [[Battle of Wisconsin Heights]] on July 21, with forty to seventy killed and only one killed on the United States side. The Ho Chunk Nation fought on the side of the United States. The Black Hawk War ended with the Battle of Bad Axe on August 1\u20132, with over 150 of the British Band dead and 75 captured and only five killed in the United States forces. Those crossing the Mississippi were killed by Lakota, American and Ho Chunk Forces.  Many of the British Band survivors were handed over to the United States on August 20 by the Lakota Tribe, with the exception of Black Hawk, who had retreated into Vernon County, Wisconsin and White Cloud, who surrendered on August 27, 1832.  Black Hawk was captured by Decorah south of Bangor, Wisconsin, south of the headwaters of the La Crosse River. He was then sold to the U.S. military at Prairie du Chien, accepted by future Confederate president, Stephen Davis, who was a soldier at the time. Black Hawk's tribe had killed his daughter. Black Hawk moved back to Iowa in 1833, after being held prisoner by the United States government.<ref>See Notes and  References section of [[Black Hawk War]]</ref>\n\n===Territorial settlement===\n[[File:Seal of Wisconsin.svg|left|thumb|The [[Seal of Wisconsin|state seal]] of Wisconsin contains a shovel and pickaxe, reflecting the importance of lead mining to Wisconsin's history.]]\n[[Image:Vertefeuille.JPG|thumbnail|right|The [[Francois Vertefeuille House]] in the [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin|Prairie du Chien]] was built in the 1810s by fur traders.

Many of the region's first settlers were drawn by the prospect of [[lead]] mining in southwest Wisconsin. This area had traditionally been mined by Native Americans. However, after a series of treaties removed the Indians, the lead mining region was opened to white miners. Thousands rushed in from across the country to dig for the \"gray gold\". By 1829, 4,253 miners and 52 licensed smelting works were in the region.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Risjord |first1=Norman K. |title=Wisconsin: The History of the Badger State |date=2007 |publisher=Trails Books |location=Madison, Wisconsin |page=61 |edition=2}}</ref> Expert miners from [[Cornwall]], England, formed a large part of the wave of immigrants. Boom towns like [[Mineral Point, Wisconsin|Mineral Point]], [[Platteville, Wisconsin|Platteville]], [[Shullsburg, Wisconsin|Shullsburg]], [[Belmont, Wisconsin|Belmont]], and [[New Diggings, Wisconsin|New Diggings]] sprang up around mines. The first two federal land offices in Wisconsin were opened in 1834 at Green Bay and at Mineral Point.{{ref|Landoffices}} By the 1840s, southwest Wisconsin mines were producing more than half of the nation's lead, which was no small amount, as the United States was producing annually some 31 million pounds of lead.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Risjord |first1=Norman K. |title=Wisconsin: The Story of the Badger State |date=2007 |publisher=Trails Books |location=Madison, Wisconsin |isbn=978-1-931599-87-0 |page=63}}</ref> Wisconsin was dubbed the \"Badger State\" because of the  lead miners who first settled there in the 1820s and 1830s.

Milwaukee, along with [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]], and [[Kewaunee, Wisconsin|Kewaunee]], can be traced back to a series of trading posts established by the French trader [[Jacques Vieau]] in 1795. Vieau's post at the mouth of the [[Milwaukee River]] was purchased in 1820 by [[Solomon Juneau]], who had visited the area as early as 1818. Juneau moved to what is now Milwaukee and took over the trading post's operation in 1825.\n\nWhen the fur trade began to decline, Juneau focused on developing the land around his trading post. In the 1830s he formed a partnership with Green Bay lawyer Morgan Martin, and the two men bought 160 acres (0.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land between Lake Michigan and the Milwaukee River. There they founded the settlement of Juneautown. Meanwhile, an Ohio businessman named [[Byron Kilbourn]] began to invest in the land west of the Milwaukee River, forming the settlement of Kilbourntown. South of these two settlements, [[George H. Walker]] founded the town of [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Walker.27s Point|Walker's Point]] in 1835. Each of these three settlements engaged in a fierce competition to attract the most residents and become the largest of the three towns. In 1840, the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]] ordered the construction of a bridge over the Milwaukee River to replace the inadequate ferry system. In 1845, Byron Kilbourn, who had been trying to isolate Juneautown to make it more dependent on Kilbourntown, destroyed a portion of the bridge, which started the [[Milwaukee Bridge War]]. For several weeks, skirmishes broke out between the residents of both towns. No one was killed but several people were injured, some seriously. On January 31, 1846 the settlements of Juneautown, Kilbourntown, and Walker's Point merged into the incorporated city of Milwaukee. Solomon Juneau was elected mayor. The new city had a population of about 10,000 people, making it the largest city in the territory. Milwaukee remains the largest city in Wisconsin to this day.\n\n===Wisconsin Territory===\n\n[[File:Wisconsinterritory.PNG|320px|thumb|Map of Wisconsin Territory 1836\u20131848]]\n\n[[Wisconsin Territory]] was created by an act of the [[United States Congress]] on April 20, 1836. By fall of that year, the best prairie groves of the counties surrounding Milwaukee were occupied by [[New England]] farmers.<ref>Wisconsin, a Guide to the Badger State page 197</ref> The new territory initially included all of the present day states of [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Iowa]], as well as parts of [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]]. At the time the Congress called it the \"Wiskonsin Territory\".<ref>http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/ref/collection/maps/id/643 Wisconsin Historical Society</ref>\n\nThe first [[List of Governors of Wisconsin|territorial governor of Wisconsin]] was [[Henry Dodge]]. He and other territorial lawmakers were initially busied by organizing the territory's government and selecting a capital city. The selection of a location to build a capitol caused a heated debate among the territorial politicians. At first, Governor Dodge selected Belmont, located in the heavily populated lead mining district, to be capital. Shortly after the new legislature convened there, however, it became obvious that [[First Capitol Historic Site|Wisconsin's first capitol]] was inadequate. Numerous other suggestions for the location of the capital were given representing nearly every city that existed in the territory at the time, and Governor Dodge left the decision up to the other lawmakers. The legislature accepted a proposal by [[James Duane Doty]] to build a new city named [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] on an isthmus between lakes Mendota and Monona and put the territory's permanent capital there.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://firstcapitol.wisconsinhistory.org/About/History.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307210439/http://firstcapitol.wisconsinhistory.org/About/History.aspx |archive-date=2017-03-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1837, while Madison was being built, the capitol was temporarily moved to [[Burlington, Iowa|Burlington]].

He identified these layers as multiple \"frontiers\" over three centuries: Native American frontier, French frontier, English frontier, fur-trade frontier, mining frontier, and the logging frontier. Finally the coming of the railroad brought the end of the frontier.<ref>Mark Wyman, '' The Wisconsin Frontier'' (2009) pp 182, 293-94</ref>\n\nThe historian of the frontier, [[Frederick Jackson Turner]], grew up in Wisconsin during its last frontier stage, and in his travels around the state he could see the layers of social and political development. One of Turner's last students, [[Merle Curti]] used in-depth analysis of local history in [[Trempeleau County]] to test Turner's thesis about democracy. Turner's view was that American democracy, \"involved widespread participation in the making of decisions affecting the common life, the development of initiative and self-reliance, and equality of economic and cultural opportunity. It thus also involved Americanization of immigrant.\"<ref>Merle Curti, ''The Making of an American Community: A Case Study of Democracy in a Frontier County'' (1959)  p 1</ref> Curti found that from 1840 to 1860 in Wisconsin the poorest groups gained rapidly in land ownership, and often rose to political leadership at the local level. He found that even landless young farm workers were soon able to obtain their own farms. Free land on the frontier therefore created opportunity and democracy, for both European immigrants as well as old stock Yankees.<ref>Wyman, ''The Wisconsin Frontier'', p 293</ref>\n\n==Statehood==\nBy the mid-1840s, the population of Wisconsin Territory had exceeded 150,000, more than twice the number of people required for Wisconsin to become a state. In 1846, the territorial legislature voted to apply for statehood. That fall, 124 delegates debated the state constitution. The document produced by this convention was considered extremely progressive for its time. It banned commercial banking, granted married women the right to own property, and left the question of African-American [[suffrage]] to a popular vote. Most Wisconsinites considered the first constitution to be too radical, however, and voted it down in an April 1847 referendum.\n\nIn December 1847, a second constitutional convention was called. This convention resulted in a new, more moderate state constitution that Wisconsinites approved in a March 1848 referendum, enabling Wisconsin to become the 30th state on May 29, 1848. Wisconsin was the last state entirely east of the [[Mississippi River]] (and by extension the last state formed entirely from territory assigned to the U.S. in the [[1783 Treaty of Paris]]) to be admitted to the Union.\n\nWith statehood, came the creation of the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], which is the state's oldest public university. The creation of this university was set aside in the state charter.\n\n===Early state economy===\nIn 1847, the ''Mineral Point Tribune'' reported that the town's furnaces were producing 43,800 pounds (19,900&nbsp;kg) of lead each day. Lead mining in southwest Wisconsin began to decline after 1848 and 1849 when the combination of less easily accessible lead ore and the [[California Gold Rush]] made miners leave the area. The lead mining industry in mining communities such as Mineral Point managed to survive into the 1860s, but the industry was never as prosperous as it was before the decline.\n\nBy 1850 Wisconsin's population was 305,000. Roughly a third (103,000) were [[Yankees]] from New England and western New York state. The second largest group were the Germans, numbering roughly 38,000, followed by 28,000 British immigrants from England, Scotland and Wales. There were roughly 63,000 Wisconsin-born residents of the state. The Yankee migrants would be the dominant political class in Wisconsin for many years.<ref>Robert C. Nesbit. ''Wisconsin: A History''. 2nd ed. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989, p. 151.</ref>\n\nA railroad frenzy swept Wisconsin shortly after it achieved statehood. The first railroad line in the state was opened between Milwaukee and [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]] in 1851 by the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]]. The railroad pushed on, reaching [[Milton, Wisconsin]] in 1852, [[Stoughton, Wisconsin]] in 1853, and the capital city of Madison in 1854. The company reached its goal of completing a rail line across the state from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River when the line to Prairie du Chien was completed in 1857. Shortly after this, other railroad companies completed their own tracks, reaching [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]] in the west and [[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior]] in the north, spurring development in those cities. By the end of the 1850s, railroads crisscrossed the state, enabling the growth of other industries that could now easily ship products to markets across the country.\n\n===Early state politics===\n[[File:Little White Schoolhouse Ripon Wisconsin Feb 2012.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Little White Schoolhouse]], in Ripon, 1854, which hosted the first meeting of what became the national Republican Party.]]\n\n[[Nelson Dewey]], the first [[governor of Wisconsin]], was a [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].

Farwell]], who served from 1852 to 1854. Under Farwell's governorship, Wisconsin became the second state to abolish [[Capital punishment in Wisconsin|capital punishment]].\n\nIn the presidential elections of 1848 and 1852, the Democratic Party won Wisconsin. In the elections of 1856, 1860, and 1864, the Republican Party won the state.\n\nBetween the 1840s and 1860s, settlers from New England, New York and Germany arrived in Wisconsin. Some of them brought radical political ideas to the state. In the 1850s, stop-overs on the underground railroad were set up in the state and abolitionist groups were formed. One such group was the Republican party. On March 20, 1854, the first county meeting of the Republican Party of the United States, consisting of about thirty people, was held in the [[Little White Schoolhouse]] in [[Ripon, Wisconsin]]. Ripon claims to be the birthplace of the Republican Party, as does Jackson, Michigan, where the first statewide convention was held. A notable instance of abolitionism in Wisconsin was the rescue of [[Joshua Glover]], an escaped slave from St. Louis who sought refuge in [[Racine, Wisconsin]] in 1852. He was caught in 1854 by federal marshals and put in a jail at [[Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|Cathedral Square]] in Milwaukee, where he waited to be returned to his owner. A mob of 5,000 people led by Milwaukee abolitionist [[Sherman Booth]], himself a \"Yankee\" transplant from rural New York,<ref>Richard Sisson, Christian K. Zacher, and Andrew R. L. Cayton (eds.). ''The American Midwest: An Interpretive Encyclopedia''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2007, p. 195.</ref> sprung Glover from jail and helped him escape to Canada via the underground railroad.\n\n===Immigration===\nIn the 1850s, two-thirds of immigrants to Wisconsin came from the eastern United States, the other one-third being foreign-born. The majority of the foreign born were German immigrants. Many Irish and Norwegian immigrants also came to Wisconsin in the 1850s. Northern Europeans, many of whom were persecuted in their home countries because of their support for the failed bourgeois [[Revolutions of 1848]], often chose Wisconsin because of the liberal constitution of human rights such as the state's unusual recognition of immigrants' right to vote and rights to citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-018/?action=more_essay|title=19th-Century Immigration |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society |accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Yankees and ethnocultural politics===\nYankee settlers from New England started arriving in Wisconsin in the 1830s spread throughout the southern half of the territory. They dominated early politics. Most of them started as farmers, but the larger proportion moved to towns and cities as entrepreneurs, businessmen and professionals.\n\nHistorian John Bunker has examined the worldview of the Yankee settlers in the Wisconsin:\n: Because they arrived first and had a strong sense of community and mission, Yankees were able to transplant New England institutions, values, and mores, altered only by the conditions of frontier life. They established a public culture that emphasized the work ethic, the sanctity of private property, individual responsibility, faith in residential and social mobility, practicality, piety, public order and decorum, reverence for public education, activists, honest, and frugal government, town meeting democracy, and he believed that there was a public interest that transcends particular and stick ambitions. Regarding themselves as the elect and just in a world rife with sin, air, and corruption, they felt a strong moral obligation to define and enforce standards of community and personal behavior....This pietistic worldview was substantially shared by British, Scandinavian, Swiss, English-Canadian and Dutch Reformed immigrants, as well as by German Protestants and many of the \"Forty-Niners.\" <ref>John Buenker, \"Wisconsin\" in {{cite book|last=James H.

The circular [[silo]] was used to store feed.]]\n\nAgriculture was a major component of the Wisconsin economy during the 19th century. [[Wheat]] was a primary crop on early Wisconsin farms. In fact, during the mid 19th century, Wisconsin produced about one sixth of the wheat grown in the United States. However, wheat rapidly depleted nutrients in the soil, especially nitrogen, and was vulnerable to insects, bad weather, and [[wheat leaf rust]]. In the 1860s, [[Blissus leucopterus|chinch bug]]s arrived in Wisconsin and damaged wheat across the state. As the soil lost its quality and prices dropped, the practice of wheat farming moved west into Iowa and Minnesota. Some Wisconsin farmers responded by experimenting with [[crop rotation]] and other methods to restore the soil's fertility, but a larger number turned to alternatives to wheat.\n\nIn parts of northern Wisconsin, farmers cultivated [[cranberry|cranberries]] and in a few counties in south central Wisconsin, farmers had success growing tobacco,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-061/|title=Farming and Rural Life |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society |accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref> but the most popular replacement for wheat was dairy farming. As wheat fell out of favor, many Wisconsin farmers started raising dairy cattle and growing feed crops, which were better suited to Wisconsin's climate and soil. One reason for the popularity of dairy farming was that many of Wisconsin's farmers had come to the state from New York, the leading producer of dairy products at the time. In addition, many immigrants from Europe brought an extensive knowledge of cheese making. Dairying was also promoted by the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison's school of agriculture, which offered education to dairy farmers and researched ways to produce better dairy products. The first test of butterfat content in milk was developed at the university, which allowed for consistency in the quality of butter and cheese. By 1899, over ninety percent of Wisconsin farms raised dairy cows and by 1915, Wisconsin had become the leading producer of dairy products in the United States,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-028/?action=more_essay|title=The Rise of Dairy Farming |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society |accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref> a position it held until the 1990s.<ref name=\"fmma2002\">{{cite news|title=2001 Milk Production|url=http://www.fmmacentral.com/PDFdata/msb0202.pdf|format=PDF|work=Marketing Service Bulletin|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|date=February 2002|accessdate=2007-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221063039/http://fmmacentral.com/PDFdata/msb0202.pdf|archive-date=2007-02-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The term ''America's Dairyland'' appeared in newspapers as early as 1913 when the state's butterfat production became first in the nation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Supremacy of Wisconsin in Dairy Interests |newspaper=Marshfield Times|date=September 10, 1913|pages=1, 4}}</ref> In 1939 the state legislature enacted a bill to add the slogan to the state's automobile license plates.<ref>\"[https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lrb/blue_book/2005_2006/975_symbols.pdf Wisconsin State Symbols] in ''Wisconsin Blue Book 2005\u20132006'', p. 968.</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=\"America's Dairyland\" to Be Put on License Plates|newspaper=Manitowoc Herald-Times|date=May 16, 1939|page=1}}</ref> It continues to be the nation's largest producer of cheese, no longer focusing on the raw material (milk) but rather the value-added products.

The huge growth in the brewing industry can be accredited, in part, to the influx of German immigrants to Wisconsin in the 1840s and 1850s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-051/?action=more_essay|title=Brewing and Prohibition |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref> Milwaukee breweries also grew in volume due to the destruction of Chicago's breweries during the great Chicago fire (see: http://www.beerhistory.com/library/holdings/milwaukee.shtml). In the second half of the 19th century, four of the largest breweries in the United States opened in Milwaukee: [[Miller Brewing Company]], [[Pabst Brewing Company]], [[Valentin Blatz Brewing Company]], and [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company]]. In the 20th century Pabst absorbed Blatz and Schlitz, and moved its brewery and corporate headquarters to California. Miller continues to operate in Milwaukee. The [[Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company]] opened in [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin]] in 1867 and continues to operate there to this day.\n\n====Logging====\n[[File:Logging sleigh.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Logs being transported on a [[sleigh]] after being cut.]]\n\nAgriculture was not viable in the densely forested northern and central parts of Wisconsin. Settlers came to this region for [[logging]]. The timber industry first set up along the Wisconsin River. Rivers were used to transport lumber from where the wood was being cut, to the sawmills. Sawmills in cities like [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]] and [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin|Stevens Point]] sawed the lumber into boards that were used for construction. The Wolf River also saw considerable logging by industrious Menominee. The Black and Chippewa Rivers formed a third major logging region. That area was dominated by one company owned by [[Frederick Weyerhaeuser]]. The construction of railroads allowed loggers to log year round, after rivers froze, and go deeper into the forests to cut down previously unshippable wood supplies. Wood products from Wisconsin's forests such as doors, furniture, beams, shipping boxes, and ships were made in industrial cities with connects to the Wisconsin lumber industry such as Chicago, Milwaukee, [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], and [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]]. Milwaukee and Manitowoc were centers for commercial ship building in Wisconsin. Many cargo ships built in these communities were used to transport lumber from logging ports to major industrial cities.<ref>http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=11565&term_type_id=3&term_type_text=things&letter=S</ref> Later a growing paper industry in the Fox River Valley made use of wood pulp from the state's lumber industry.\n\nLogging was a dangerous trade, with high accident rates. On October 8, 1871, the [[Peshtigo Fire]] burned 1,875 square miles (4,850&nbsp;km\u00b2) of forest land around the timber industry town of [[Peshtigo, Wisconsin]], killing between 1,200 and 2,500 people. It was the deadliest fire in United States history.\n[[File:Wisconsin. Appleton Paper Mills-LCCN2008678245.tif|thumb|left|Paper Mills in Appleton in 1900]]\nFrom the 1870s to the 1890s, much of the logging in Wisconsin was done by immigrants from [[Scandinavia]].\n\nBy the beginning of the twentieth century, logging in Wisconsin had gone into decline. Many forests had been cleared and never replanted and large corporations in the Pacific Northwest took business away from the Wisconsin industry. The logging companies sold their land to immigrants and out of work lumberjacks who hoped to turn the acres of pine stumps into farms, but few met with success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-027/?action=more_essay|title=Logging and Forest Products |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWisconsin is known in the 18th century to have discovered gold deposits in western wisconsin. Such discoveries occurred around the town of st croix falls where a settler stumbled across a gold nugget valued to be worth lots at the time. It's no surprise wisconsin's western region was once the site of volcanic eruptions so it makes sense that minerals that weren't commonly found in other parts of the state would be present here.\n\n==20th century==\n[[File:Robert M.

Since its admission to the Union on May 29, 1848 as 30th state, Wisconsin has been ethnically heterogeneous, with [[Yankee]]s being among the first to arrive from New York and New England. They dominated the state's heavy industry, finance, politics and education. Large numbers of European immigrants followed them, including [[German American]]s, mostly between 1850 and 1900, Scandinavians (the largest group being [[Norwegian Americans]]) and smaller groups of [[Belgian American]]s, [[Dutch American]]s, [[Swiss American]]s, [[Finnish American]]s, [[Irish American]]s and others; in the 20th century, large numbers of [[Polish American]]s and [[African American]]s came, settling mainly in Milwaukee. Politically the state was predominantly Republican until recent years, when it became more evenly balanced. The state took a national leadership role in the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive Movement]], under the aegis of [[Robert M.

The retreating glaciers left behind a tundra in Wisconsin inhabited by large animals, such as [[mammoth]]s, [[mastodon]]s, [[bison]], [[Castoroides|giant beaver]], and [[muskox]]. The [[Boaz mastodon]] and the [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] artifacts discovered in [[Boaz, Wisconsin]] show that the Paleo-Indians hunted these large animals.

Copper ornaments like beaded necklaces also appeared around 1500 BC. These people gathered copper ore at quarries on the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] in Michigan and on [[Isle Royale]] in Lake Superior.

A rectangular wood-and-clay stockade surrounded the twenty acre site, which contained two large earthen mounds and a central plaza. One mound may have been used for food storage, as a residence for high-ranking officials, or as a temple, and the other may have been used as a mortuary. The Mississippian Culture cultivated maize intensively, and their fields probably stretched far beyond the stockade at Aztalan, although modern agriculture has erased any traces of Mississippian practices in the area. Some rumors also speculate that the people of Aztalan may have experimented slightly with stone architecture in the making of a man-made, stone-line pond, at the very least.

Accompanied by seven Huron guides, Nicolet left New France and canoed through [[Lake Huron]] and [[Lake Superior]], and then became the first European known to have entered [[Lake Michigan]]. Nicolet proceeded into [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]], which he named ''La Baie des Puants'' (literally \"The Stinking Bay\"), and probably came ashore near the [[Red Banks, Brown County, Wisconsin|Red Banks]]. He made contact with the Ho-Chunk and Menominee living in the area and established peaceful relations.

They returned to Wisconsin in 1659-1660, this time at [[Chequamegon Bay]] on Lake Superior. On their second voyage they found that the [[Ojibwe]] had expanded into northern Wisconsin, as they continued to prosper in the fur trade. They also were the first Europeans to contact the Santee Dakota. They built a trading post and wintered near [[Ashland, Wisconsin|Ashland]], before returning to Montreal.\n\nIn 1665 [[Claude-Jean Allouez]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary, built a mission on Lake Superior. Five years later he abandoned the mission, and journeyed to ''La Baie des Puants''. Two years later he built [[St. Francis Xavier Mission]] near present-day [[De Pere, Wisconsin|De Pere]]. In his journeys through Wisconsin, he encountered groups of Native Americans who had been displaced by Iroquois in the Beaver Wars. He evangelized the Algonquin-speaking [[Potawatomi]], who had settled on the [[Door Peninsula]] after fleeing Iroquois attacks in Michigan. He also encountered the Algonquin-speaking [[Sauk people|Sauk]], who had been forced into Michigan by the Iroquois, and then had been forced into central Wisconsin by the Ojibwe and the Huron.\n\nThe next major expedition into Wisconsin was that of Father [[Jacques Marquette]] and [[Louis Jolliet]] in 1673. After hearing rumors from Indians telling of the existence of the [[Mississippi River]], Marquette and Joliet set out from [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace]], in what is now Michigan, and entered the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]] at Green Bay. They canoed up the Fox until they reached the river's westernmost point, and then portaged, or carried their boats, to the nearby [[Wisconsin River]], where they resumed canoeing downstream to the Mississippi River. Marquette and Joliet reached the Mississippi near what is now [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]] in June, 1673.<ref>{{cite web|title=Turning Points in Wisconsin History: Arrival of the First Europeans|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-006/?action=more_essay|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wisconsin in 1718.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Wisconsin in 1718, [[Guillaume de L'Isle]] map, approximate state area highlighted.]]\n\n[[Nicolas Perrot]], French commander of the west, established Fort St. Nicholas at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin in May, 1685, near the southwest end of the [[Fox-Wisconsin Waterway]].

Like the French, the British were interested in little but the fur trade. One notable event in the fur trading industry in Wisconsin occurred in 1791, when two free African Americans set up a fur trading post among the Menominee at present day [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]]. The first permanent settlers, mostly [[French Canadian]]s, some Anglo-New Englanders and a few African American freedmen, arrived in Wisconsin while it was under British control. [[Charles Michel de Langlade]] is generally recognized as the first settler, establishing a trading post at Green Bay in 1745, and moving there permanently in 1764.<ref>\"Langlade, Charles Michel 1729\u20131801,\" ''Dictionary of Wisconsin Biography''http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2266&search_term=langlade</ref> In 1766 the Royal Governor of the new territory, [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Robert Rogers]], engaged [[Jonathan Carver]] to explore and map the newly acquired territories for the Crown, and to search for a possible [[Northwest Passage]]. Carver left [[Fort Michilimackinac]] that spring and spent the next three years exploring and mapping what is now Wisconsin and parts of Minnesota.\n\nSettlement began at Prairie du Chien around 1781. The French residents at the trading post in what is now Green Bay, referred to the town as \"La Bey\", however British fur traders referred to it as \"Green Bay\", because the water and the shore assumed green tints in early spring. The old French title was gradually dropped, and the British name of \"Green Bay\" eventually stuck. The region coming under British rule had virtually no adverse effect on the French residents as the British needed the cooperation of the French fur traders and the French fur traders needed the goodwill of the British. During the French occupation of the region licenses for fur trading had been issued scarcely and only to select groups of traders, whereas the British, in an effort to make as much money as possible from the region, issued licenses for fur trading freely, both to British and French residents. The fur trade in what is now Wisconsin reached its height under British rule, and the first self-sustaining farms in the state were established at this time as well. From 1763 to 1780, Green Bay was a prosperous community which produced its own foodstuff, built graceful cottages and held dances and festivities.<ref>''Wisconsin, a Guide to the Badger State'' page 188</ref>\n\n==The territorial period==\nThe United States acquired Wisconsin in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]]. [[Massachusetts]] claimed the territory east of the Mississippi River between the present-day Wisconsin-Illinois border and present-day [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]]. [[Virginia]] claimed the territory north of La Crosse to Lake Superior and all of present-day Minnesota east of the Mississippi River. Shortly afterward, in 1787, the Americans made Wisconsin part of the new [[Northwest Territory]]. Later, in 1800, Wisconsin became part of [[Indiana Territory]]. Despite the fact that Wisconsin belonged to the United States at this time, the British continued to control the local fur trade and maintain military alliances with Wisconsin Indians.\n\n===The War of 1812 and the Indian wars===\n[[File:Chief Black Hawk3.jpg|left|160px|thumb|Chief Black Hawk, from [[History of the Indian Tribes of North America]].]]\n\nThe United States did not firmly exercise control over Wisconsin until the [[War of 1812]]. In 1814, the Americans built [[Fort Shelby (Wisconsin)|Fort Shelby]] at Prairie du Chien. During the war, the Americans and British fought one battle in Wisconsin, the July, 1814 [[Siege of Prairie du Chien]], which ended as a British victory. The British captured Fort Shelby and renamed it Fort McKay, after Major [[William McKay]], the British commander who led the forces that won the Battle of Prairie du Chien. However, the 1815 [[Treaty of Ghent]] reaffirmed American jurisdiction over Wisconsin, which was by then a part of [[Illinois Territory]]. Following the treaty, British troops burned Fort McKay, rather than giving it back to the Americans, and departed Wisconsin.<ref>http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whi/fullRecord.asp?id=42229</ref> To protect Prairie du Chien from future attacks, the United States Army constructed [[Fort Crawford]] in 1816, on the same site as Fort Shelby.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortcrawfordmuseum.com/history.html|title=History|author=|date=|website=Fort Crawford Museum|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref> [[Fort Howard (Wisconsin)|Fort Howard]] was also built in 1816 in Green Bay.<ref>http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/archaeology/forts.asp</ref>\n\nSignificant American settlement in Wisconsin, a part of [[Michigan Territory]] beginning in 1818, was delayed by two Indian wars, the minor [[Winnebago War]] of 1827 and the larger [[Black Hawk War]] of 1832.\n\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; clear:right;\"\n|-\n| {{Black Hawk War Map}}\n|-\n|Map of Black Hawk War sites<br />[[File:Red Battle X.png|8px]] <small>Battle (with name)</small> [[File:Red pog.svg|7px]] <small>Fort / settlement</small> [[File:Green pog.svg|7px]] <small>Native village</small><br /><small>Symbols are wikilinked to article</small>\n|}\n\n====The Winnebago War====\nThe Winnebago War started when, in 1826, two Winnebago men were detained at Fort Crawford on charges of murder and then transferred to [[Fort Snelling]] in present-day Minnesota. The Winnebago in the area believed that both men had been executed. On June 27, 1827, a Winnebago war band led by Chief [[Red Bird]] and the prophet [[Wabokieshiek|White Cloud]] (Wabokieshiek) attacked a family of settlers outside of Prairie du Chien, killing two men. They then went on to attack two keel-boats on the Mississippi River that were heading toward Fort Snelling, killing two men and injuring four more. Seven Winnebago warriors were killed in those attacks. The war band also attacked settlers on the lower Wisconsin River and the lead mines at [[Galena, Illinois]]. The war band surrendered at [[Portage, Wisconsin]], rather than fighting the United States Army that was pursuing them.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Crawford and Richland Counties, Wisconsin|publisher=Union Publishing Co.|location=Springfield, Ill.|year=1884|volume=1|chapter=Chapter 6|url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/wch&CISOPTR=18156&REC=1|accessdate=2009-11-15}}</ref>\n\n====The Black Hawk War====\nIn the Black Hawk War, Sac, Fox, and [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] Native Americans, otherwise known as the British Band, led by [[Black Hawk (chief)|Chief Black Hawk]], who had been relocated from Illinois to Iowa, attempted to resettle in their Illinois homeland on April 5, 1832, in violation of Treaty. On May 10 Chief Black Hawk decided to go back to Iowa. On May 14, Black Hawk's forces met with a group of militia men led by [[Isaiah Stillman]]. All three members of Black Hawk's parley were shot and one was killed. The [[Battle of Stillman's Run]] ensued, leaving twelve militia men and three to five Sac and Fox warriors dead. Of the fifteen battles of the war, six took place in Wisconsin. The other nine as well as several smaller skirmishes took place in Illinois. The first confrontation to take place in Wisconsin was the first [[Attacks at Fort Blue Mounds|attack on Fort Blue Mounds]] on June 6, in which one member of the local militia was killed outside of the fort. There was also the [[Spafford Farm Massacre]] on June 14, the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1832)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] on June 16, which was a United States victory, the second attack on Fort Blue Mounds on June 20, and the [[Sinsinawa Mound raid]] on June 29. The Native Americans were defeated at the [[Battle of Wisconsin Heights]] on July 21, with forty to seventy killed and only one killed on the United States side. The Ho Chunk Nation fought on the side of the United States. The Black Hawk War ended with the Battle of Bad Axe on August 1\u20132, with over 150 of the British Band dead and 75 captured and only five killed in the United States forces. Those crossing the Mississippi were killed by Lakota, American and Ho Chunk Forces.  Many of the British Band survivors were handed over to the United States on August 20 by the Lakota Tribe, with the exception of Black Hawk, who had retreated into Vernon County, Wisconsin and White Cloud, who surrendered on August 27, 1832.  Black Hawk was captured by Decorah south of Bangor, Wisconsin, south of the headwaters of the La Crosse River. He was then sold to the U.S. military at Prairie du Chien, accepted by future Confederate president, Stephen Davis, who was a soldier at the time. Black Hawk's tribe had killed his daughter. Black Hawk moved back to Iowa in 1833, after being held prisoner by the United States government.<ref>See Notes and  References section of [[Black Hawk War]]</ref>\n\n===Territorial settlement===\n[[File:Seal of Wisconsin.svg|left|thumb|The [[Seal of Wisconsin|state seal]] of Wisconsin contains a shovel and pickaxe, reflecting the importance of lead mining to Wisconsin's history.]]\n[[Image:Vertefeuille.JPG|thumbnail|right|The [[Francois Vertefeuille House]] in the [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin|Prairie du Chien]] was built in the 1810s by fur traders.

Many of the region's first settlers were drawn by the prospect of [[lead]] mining in southwest Wisconsin. This area had traditionally been mined by Native Americans. However, after a series of treaties removed the Indians, the lead mining region was opened to white miners. Thousands rushed in from across the country to dig for the \"gray gold\". By 1829, 4,253 miners and 52 licensed smelting works were in the region.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Risjord |first1=Norman K. |title=Wisconsin: The History of the Badger State |date=2007 |publisher=Trails Books |location=Madison, Wisconsin |page=61 |edition=2}}</ref> Expert miners from [[Cornwall]], England, formed a large part of the wave of immigrants. Boom towns like [[Mineral Point, Wisconsin|Mineral Point]], [[Platteville, Wisconsin|Platteville]], [[Shullsburg, Wisconsin|Shullsburg]], [[Belmont, Wisconsin|Belmont]], and [[New Diggings, Wisconsin|New Diggings]] sprang up around mines. The first two federal land offices in Wisconsin were opened in 1834 at Green Bay and at Mineral Point.{{ref|Landoffices}} By the 1840s, southwest Wisconsin mines were producing more than half of the nation's lead, which was no small amount, as the United States was producing annually some 31 million pounds of lead.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Risjord |first1=Norman K. |title=Wisconsin: The Story of the Badger State |date=2007 |publisher=Trails Books |location=Madison, Wisconsin |isbn=978-1-931599-87-0 |page=63}}</ref> Wisconsin was dubbed the \"Badger State\" because of the  lead miners who first settled there in the 1820s and 1830s.

Milwaukee, along with [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]], and [[Kewaunee, Wisconsin|Kewaunee]], can be traced back to a series of trading posts established by the French trader [[Jacques Vieau]] in 1795. Vieau's post at the mouth of the [[Milwaukee River]] was purchased in 1820 by [[Solomon Juneau]], who had visited the area as early as 1818. Juneau moved to what is now Milwaukee and took over the trading post's operation in 1825.\n\nWhen the fur trade began to decline, Juneau focused on developing the land around his trading post. In the 1830s he formed a partnership with Green Bay lawyer Morgan Martin, and the two men bought 160 acres (0.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land between Lake Michigan and the Milwaukee River. There they founded the settlement of Juneautown. Meanwhile, an Ohio businessman named [[Byron Kilbourn]] began to invest in the land west of the Milwaukee River, forming the settlement of Kilbourntown. South of these two settlements, [[George H. Walker]] founded the town of [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Walker.27s Point|Walker's Point]] in 1835. Each of these three settlements engaged in a fierce competition to attract the most residents and become the largest of the three towns. In 1840, the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]] ordered the construction of a bridge over the Milwaukee River to replace the inadequate ferry system. In 1845, Byron Kilbourn, who had been trying to isolate Juneautown to make it more dependent on Kilbourntown, destroyed a portion of the bridge, which started the [[Milwaukee Bridge War]]. For several weeks, skirmishes broke out between the residents of both towns. No one was killed but several people were injured, some seriously. On January 31, 1846 the settlements of Juneautown, Kilbourntown, and Walker's Point merged into the incorporated city of Milwaukee. Solomon Juneau was elected mayor. The new city had a population of about 10,000 people, making it the largest city in the territory. Milwaukee remains the largest city in Wisconsin to this day.\n\n===Wisconsin Territory===\n\n[[File:Wisconsinterritory.PNG|320px|thumb|Map of Wisconsin Territory 1836\u20131848]]\n\n[[Wisconsin Territory]] was created by an act of the [[United States Congress]] on April 20, 1836. By fall of that year, the best prairie groves of the counties surrounding Milwaukee were occupied by [[New England]] farmers.<ref>Wisconsin, a Guide to the Badger State page 197</ref> The new territory initially included all of the present day states of [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Iowa]], as well as parts of [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]].

He and other territorial lawmakers were initially busied by organizing the territory's government and selecting a capital city. The selection of a location to build a capitol caused a heated debate among the territorial politicians. At first, Governor Dodge selected Belmont, located in the heavily populated lead mining district, to be capital. Shortly after the new legislature convened there, however, it became obvious that [[First Capitol Historic Site|Wisconsin's first capitol]] was inadequate. Numerous other suggestions for the location of the capital were given representing nearly every city that existed in the territory at the time, and Governor Dodge left the decision up to the other lawmakers. The legislature accepted a proposal by [[James Duane Doty]] to build a new city named [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] on an isthmus between lakes Mendota and Monona and put the territory's permanent capital there.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://firstcapitol.wisconsinhistory.org/About/History.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307210439/http://firstcapitol.wisconsinhistory.org/About/History.aspx |archive-date=2017-03-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1837, while Madison was being built, the capitol was temporarily moved to [[Burlington, Iowa|Burlington]].

He identified these layers as multiple \"frontiers\" over three centuries: Native American frontier, French frontier, English frontier, fur-trade frontier, mining frontier, and the logging frontier. Finally the coming of the railroad brought the end of the frontier.<ref>Mark Wyman, '' The Wisconsin Frontier'' (2009) pp 182, 293-94</ref>\n\nThe historian of the frontier, [[Frederick Jackson Turner]], grew up in Wisconsin during its last frontier stage, and in his travels around the state he could see the layers of social and political development. One of Turner's last students, [[Merle Curti]] used in-depth analysis of local history in [[Trempeleau County]] to test Turner's thesis about democracy. Turner's view was that American democracy, \"involved widespread participation in the making of decisions affecting the common life, the development of initiative and self-reliance, and equality of economic and cultural opportunity. It thus also involved Americanization of immigrant.\"<ref>Merle Curti, ''The Making of an American Community: A Case Study of Democracy in a Frontier County'' (1959)  p 1</ref> Curti found that from 1840 to 1860 in Wisconsin the poorest groups gained rapidly in land ownership, and often rose to political leadership at the local level. He found that even landless young farm workers were soon able to obtain their own farms. Free land on the frontier therefore created opportunity and democracy, for both European immigrants as well as old stock Yankees.<ref>Wyman, ''The Wisconsin Frontier'', p 293</ref>\n\n==Statehood==\nBy the mid-1840s, the population of Wisconsin Territory had exceeded 150,000, more than twice the number of people required for Wisconsin to become a state. In 1846, the territorial legislature voted to apply for statehood. That fall, 124 delegates debated the state constitution. The document produced by this convention was considered extremely progressive for its time. It banned commercial banking, granted married women the right to own property, and left the question of African-American [[suffrage]] to a popular vote. Most Wisconsinites considered the first constitution to be too radical, however, and voted it down in an April 1847 referendum.\n\nIn December 1847, a second constitutional convention was called. This convention resulted in a new, more moderate state constitution that Wisconsinites approved in a March 1848 referendum, enabling Wisconsin to become the 30th state on May 29, 1848. Wisconsin was the last state entirely east of the [[Mississippi River]] (and by extension the last state formed entirely from territory assigned to the U.S. in the [[1783 Treaty of Paris]]) to be admitted to the Union.\n\nWith statehood, came the creation of the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], which is the state's oldest public university. The creation of this university was set aside in the state charter.\n\n===Early state economy===\nIn 1847, the ''Mineral Point Tribune'' reported that the town's furnaces were producing 43,800 pounds (19,900&nbsp;kg) of lead each day. Lead mining in southwest Wisconsin began to decline after 1848 and 1849 when the combination of less easily accessible lead ore and the [[California Gold Rush]] made miners leave the area. The lead mining industry in mining communities such as Mineral Point managed to survive into the 1860s, but the industry was never as prosperous as it was before the decline.\n\nBy 1850 Wisconsin's population was 305,000. Roughly a third (103,000) were [[Yankees]] from New England and western New York state. The second largest group were the Germans, numbering roughly 38,000, followed by 28,000 British immigrants from England, Scotland and Wales. There were roughly 63,000 Wisconsin-born residents of the state. The Yankee migrants would be the dominant political class in Wisconsin for many years.<ref>Robert C. Nesbit. ''Wisconsin: A History''. 2nd ed. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989, p. 151.</ref>\n\nA railroad frenzy swept Wisconsin shortly after it achieved statehood. The first railroad line in the state was opened between Milwaukee and [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]] in 1851 by the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]]. The railroad pushed on, reaching [[Milton, Wisconsin]] in 1852, [[Stoughton, Wisconsin]] in 1853, and the capital city of Madison in 1854. The company reached its goal of completing a rail line across the state from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River when the line to Prairie du Chien was completed in 1857. Shortly after this, other railroad companies completed their own tracks, reaching [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]] in the west and [[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior]] in the north, spurring development in those cities. By the end of the 1850s, railroads crisscrossed the state, enabling the growth of other industries that could now easily ship products to markets across the country.\n\n===Early state politics===\n[[File:Little White Schoolhouse Ripon Wisconsin Feb 2012.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Little White Schoolhouse]], in Ripon, 1854, which hosted the first meeting of what became the national Republican Party.]]\n\n[[Nelson Dewey]], the first [[governor of Wisconsin]], was a [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].

Farwell]], who served from 1852 to 1854. Under Farwell's governorship, Wisconsin became the second state to abolish [[Capital punishment in Wisconsin|capital punishment]].\n\nIn the presidential elections of 1848 and 1852, the Democratic Party won Wisconsin. In the elections of 1856, 1860, and 1864, the Republican Party won the state.\n\nBetween the 1840s and 1860s, settlers from New England, New York and Germany arrived in Wisconsin. Some of them brought radical political ideas to the state. In the 1850s, stop-overs on the underground railroad were set up in the state and abolitionist groups were formed. One such group was the Republican party. On March 20, 1854, the first county meeting of the Republican Party of the United States, consisting of about thirty people, was held in the [[Little White Schoolhouse]] in [[Ripon, Wisconsin]]. Ripon claims to be the birthplace of the Republican Party, as does Jackson, Michigan, where the first statewide convention was held. A notable instance of abolitionism in Wisconsin was the rescue of [[Joshua Glover]], an escaped slave from St. Louis who sought refuge in [[Racine, Wisconsin]] in 1852. He was caught in 1854 by federal marshals and put in a jail at [[Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|Cathedral Square]] in Milwaukee, where he waited to be returned to his owner. A mob of 5,000 people led by Milwaukee abolitionist [[Sherman Booth]], himself a \"Yankee\" transplant from rural New York,<ref>Richard Sisson, Christian K. Zacher, and Andrew R. L. Cayton (eds.). ''The American Midwest: An Interpretive Encyclopedia''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2007, p. 195.</ref> sprung Glover from jail and helped him escape to Canada via the underground railroad.\n\n===Immigration===\nIn the 1850s, two-thirds of immigrants to Wisconsin came from the eastern United States, the other one-third being foreign-born. The majority of the foreign born were German immigrants. Many Irish and Norwegian immigrants also came to Wisconsin in the 1850s. Northern Europeans, many of whom were persecuted in their home countries because of their support for the failed bourgeois [[Revolutions of 1848]], often chose Wisconsin because of the liberal constitution of human rights such as the state's unusual recognition of immigrants' right to vote and rights to citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-018/?action=more_essay|title=19th-Century Immigration |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society |accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Yankees and ethnocultural politics===\nYankee settlers from New England started arriving in Wisconsin in the 1830s spread throughout the southern half of the territory. They dominated early politics. Most of them started as farmers, but the larger proportion moved to towns and cities as entrepreneurs, businessmen and professionals.\n\nHistorian John Bunker has examined the worldview of the Yankee settlers in the Wisconsin:\n: Because they arrived first and had a strong sense of community and mission, Yankees were able to transplant New England institutions, values, and mores, altered only by the conditions of frontier life. They established a public culture that emphasized the work ethic, the sanctity of private property, individual responsibility, faith in residential and social mobility, practicality, piety, public order and decorum, reverence for public education, activists, honest, and frugal government, town meeting democracy, and he believed that there was a public interest that transcends particular and stick ambitions. Regarding themselves as the elect and just in a world rife with sin, air, and corruption, they felt a strong moral obligation to define and enforce standards of community and personal behavior....This pietistic worldview was substantially shared by British, Scandinavian, Swiss, English-Canadian and Dutch Reformed immigrants, as well as by German Protestants and many of the \"Forty-Niners.\" <ref>John Buenker, \"Wisconsin\" in {{cite book|last=James H.

The circular [[silo]] was used to store feed.]]\n\nAgriculture was a major component of the Wisconsin economy during the 19th century. [[Wheat]] was a primary crop on early Wisconsin farms. In fact, during the mid 19th century, Wisconsin produced about one sixth of the wheat grown in the United States. However, wheat rapidly depleted nutrients in the soil, especially nitrogen, and was vulnerable to insects, bad weather, and [[wheat leaf rust]]. In the 1860s, [[Blissus leucopterus|chinch bug]]s arrived in Wisconsin and damaged wheat across the state. As the soil lost its quality and prices dropped, the practice of wheat farming moved west into Iowa and Minnesota. Some Wisconsin farmers responded by experimenting with [[crop rotation]] and other methods to restore the soil's fertility, but a larger number turned to alternatives to wheat.\n\nIn parts of northern Wisconsin, farmers cultivated [[cranberry|cranberries]] and in a few counties in south central Wisconsin, farmers had success growing tobacco,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-061/|title=Farming and Rural Life |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society |accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref> but the most popular replacement for wheat was dairy farming. As wheat fell out of favor, many Wisconsin farmers started raising dairy cattle and growing feed crops, which were better suited to Wisconsin's climate and soil. One reason for the popularity of dairy farming was that many of Wisconsin's farmers had come to the state from New York, the leading producer of dairy products at the time. In addition, many immigrants from Europe brought an extensive knowledge of cheese making. Dairying was also promoted by the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison's school of agriculture, which offered education to dairy farmers and researched ways to produce better dairy products. The first test of butterfat content in milk was developed at the university, which allowed for consistency in the quality of butter and cheese. By 1899, over ninety percent of Wisconsin farms raised dairy cows and by 1915, Wisconsin had become the leading producer of dairy products in the United States,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-028/?action=more_essay|title=The Rise of Dairy Farming |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society |accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref> a position it held until the 1990s.<ref name=\"fmma2002\">{{cite news|title=2001 Milk Production|url=http://www.fmmacentral.com/PDFdata/msb0202.pdf|format=PDF|work=Marketing Service Bulletin|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|date=February 2002|accessdate=2007-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221063039/http://fmmacentral.com/PDFdata/msb0202.pdf|archive-date=2007-02-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The term ''America's Dairyland'' appeared in newspapers as early as 1913 when the state's butterfat production became first in the nation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Supremacy of Wisconsin in Dairy Interests |newspaper=Marshfield Times|date=September 10, 1913|pages=1, 4}}</ref> In 1939 the state legislature enacted a bill to add the slogan to the state's automobile license plates.<ref>\"[https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lrb/blue_book/2005_2006/975_symbols.pdf Wisconsin State Symbols] in ''Wisconsin Blue Book 2005\u20132006'', p. 968.</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=\"America's Dairyland\" to Be Put on License Plates|newspaper=Manitowoc Herald-Times|date=May 16, 1939|page=1}}</ref> It continues to be the nation's largest producer of cheese, no longer focusing on the raw material (milk) but rather the value-added products.

In the second half of the 19th century, four of the largest breweries in the United States opened in Milwaukee: [[Miller Brewing Company]], [[Pabst Brewing Company]], [[Valentin Blatz Brewing Company]], and [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company]]. In the 20th century Pabst absorbed Blatz and Schlitz, and moved its brewery and corporate headquarters to California. Miller continues to operate in Milwaukee. The [[Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company]] opened in [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin]] in 1867 and continues to operate there to this day.\n\n====Logging====\n[[File:Logging sleigh.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Logs being transported on a [[sleigh]] after being cut.]]\n\nAgriculture was not viable in the densely forested northern and central parts of Wisconsin. Settlers came to this region for [[logging]]. The timber industry first set up along the Wisconsin River. Rivers were used to transport lumber from where the wood was being cut, to the sawmills. Sawmills in cities like [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]] and [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin|Stevens Point]] sawed the lumber into boards that were used for construction. The Wolf River also saw considerable logging by industrious Menominee. The Black and Chippewa Rivers formed a third major logging region. That area was dominated by one company owned by [[Frederick Weyerhaeuser]]. The construction of railroads allowed loggers to log year round, after rivers froze, and go deeper into the forests to cut down previously unshippable wood supplies. Wood products from Wisconsin's forests such as doors, furniture, beams, shipping boxes, and ships were made in industrial cities with connects to the Wisconsin lumber industry such as Chicago, Milwaukee, [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], and [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]]. Milwaukee and Manitowoc were centers for commercial ship building in Wisconsin. Many cargo ships built in these communities were used to transport lumber from logging ports to major industrial cities.<ref>http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=11565&term_type_id=3&term_type_text=things&letter=S</ref> Later a growing paper industry in the Fox River Valley made use of wood pulp from the state's lumber industry.\n\nLogging was a dangerous trade, with high accident rates. On October 8, 1871, the [[Peshtigo Fire]] burned 1,875 square miles (4,850&nbsp;km\u00b2) of forest land around the timber industry town of [[Peshtigo, Wisconsin]], killing between 1,200 and 2,500 people. It was the deadliest fire in United States history.\n[[File:Wisconsin. Appleton Paper Mills-LCCN2008678245.tif|thumb|left|Paper Mills in Appleton in 1900]]\nFrom the 1870s to the 1890s, much of the logging in Wisconsin was done by immigrants from [[Scandinavia]].\n\nBy the beginning of the twentieth century, logging in Wisconsin had gone into decline. Many forests had been cleared and never replanted and large corporations in the Pacific Northwest took business away from the Wisconsin industry. The logging companies sold their land to immigrants and out of work lumberjacks who hoped to turn the acres of pine stumps into farms, but few met with success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-027/?action=more_essay|title=Logging and Forest Products |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWisconsin is known in the 18th century to have discovered gold deposits in western wisconsin. Such discoveries occurred around the town of st croix falls where a settler stumbled across a gold nugget valued to be worth lots at the time. It's no surprise wisconsin's western region was once the site of volcanic eruptions so it makes sense that minerals that weren't commonly found in other parts of the state would be present here.\n\n==20th century==\n[[File:Robert M.

Therefore, Bruce only spent two years in formal schooling before leaving her small town to hold various positions in other family's homes. She became a governess at the age of fourteen to an English family who took her to [[Paris]] and then [[Melbourne, Quebec]], where she is known for being a school teacher. She taught her students farming fundamentals, but after a few years, she returned to London in 1837. She got a job working for the American Unitarian minister [[Ezra Stiles Gannett]], who eventually brought her to [[Boston]] at the age of twenty.\n\nAfter a few years of living in Boston, Bruce joined the Transcendentalist community of Brook Farm at [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts]]. Bruce\u2019s brother followed her footsteps and also joined the association in June 1841. The community\u2019s liberal religious beliefs forced all members to live in community, cooperative living. Bruce studied at the school, ran the nursery, and participated in academic discussions about various Brook Farm\u2019s literary members or visitors including Ralph Also Emerson, William Henry Channing, and Margaret Fuller. These authors and the spirit of transcendentalism had a major influence on Bruce\u2019s writing she produced while at Brook Farm. At Brook Farm, she joined the \u201cFancy Group,\u201d which allowed women to use domestic skills to paint lampshades and screens which were sold to raise money to help fund Brook Farm.\n\nBy February 1844, Bruce had supported Brook Farm\u2019s conversion to the French utopian social doctrines of [[Charles Fourier]]; although she felt the community she was once apart of lost its spontaneity; therefore, she moved to New York City. While in New York City, Bruce networked with her friend, Margaret Fuller, and landed a job as [[Eliza Farnham]]'s assistant. Eliza Farnham was most known for being the matron of the Female State Prison in Sing Sing, New York. After working at Sing Sing for a year, Bruce left New York to teach at schools in Illinois and Missouri. However, she returned east to serve as a public school teacher and governess in Pennsylvania and New York.\n\nWith funds she borrowed from [[Horace Greeley]], Bruce traveled to Santa Cruz, California in 1850 where she and Farnham purchased and worked on a farm for two years. Farnham was ridiculed for her radical ideas and decided it was best to travel to the West. They raised poultry and grew potatoes and fruit. While in California, Bruce became very involved in the women\u2019s suffrage movement, the temperance movement, and the anti-slavery crusade.\n\nLater, in 1852, Bruce married Richard Kirby, a local tanner, and had five children. She raised her five children and also continued to write fiction and short stories. She stayed in touch with friends and activists from Brook Farms, and she stayed up to date on women\u2019s rights movements through reform papers such as Greeley\u2019s New York Tribune and National Anti-Slavery Standard. The abolitionist movement and the Civil War fueled Bruce\u2019s belief that women were enslaved, and after the Civil War, she joined the women\u2019s rights movement to secure women\u2019s rights in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. By 1869, she raised enough money to fund California\u2019s first local woman suffrage society. And in 1870, she served as vice-president of the San Francisco Women\u2019s Rights Convention. Bruce reported on local lectures by [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] in the Santa Cruz Sentinel. Bruce also criticized California\u2019s judge decision that prevented women from voting and debated woman suffrage critics. In 1874, at the age of 56, she organized the Santa Cruz Temperance Union, which became affiliated with the WCTU, Women\u2019s Christian Temperance Union, that successfully encouraged the prohibition movement later in the 1920s.\n\nGeorgiana Bruce Kirby died at the age of 68 on January 27, 1887. There is a school named after her in [[Santa Cruz, California]] that supports her ideals. And In 1887, her memoir was published, Years of Experience: An Autobiographical Narrative, in addition to her diary; however, her memoir ends in 1850 when Bruce left New York for California.\n\n==References==\n# {{cite web |last1=Guarneri |first1=Carl |title=Biographical Sketch of Georgiana Bruce Kirby |url=https://documents.alexanderstreet.com/d/1010026827 |website=Alexander Street |accessdate=4 March 2020}}\n# {{cite web |title=Georgiana Bruce Kirby |url=http://newbrookfarm.org/programs/the-women-of-brook-farm/georgiana-bruce-kirby/ |website=New Brook Farm |accessdate=4 March 2020}}\n\n{{ authority control}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kirby, Georgiana Bruce}}\n[[Category:1818 births]]\n[[Category:1887 deaths]]\n[[Category:English emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:English expatriates in Canada]]\n[[Category:American schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:English expatriates in France]]\n[[Category:English schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:American diarists]]\n[[Category:American governesses]]\n[[Category:Women diarists]]\n[[Category:19th-century American short story writers]]\n[[Category:19th-century American women writers]]\n[[Category:American women short story writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Lead missing|date=March 2020}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2020}}\n{{No footnotes|date=March 2020}}\n{{Overly detailed|date=March 2020}}\n{{Tone|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n'''Georgiana Bruce Kirby''' was born on December 7, 1818, in Bristol, England.

The screenplay was co-written by noted dramatist, [[Terence Rattigan]], as a significant reworking of his 1942 play ''[[Flare Path (play)|Flare Path]]'', which incorporated his [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) experiences as a Flight Lieutenant. The film stars [[Michael Redgrave]], [[John Mills]], [[Rosamund John]] and [[Stanley Holloway]].\n\nThe title, ''The Way to the Stars'', is often assumed to have been taken from the [[Latin]] motto of the RAF, ''[[Per ardua ad astra]]''.

He is a very green \"15-hour sprog\" [[Bristol Blenheim]] pilot and is assigned to B [[Flight (military unit)|Flight]], under [[Flight Lieutenant]] David Archdale ([[Michael Redgrave]]).\n\nWhen No. 720 Squadron's commanding officer, [[Squadron Leader]] Carter ([[Trevor Howard]], in his second but first credited film role), is shot down, Archdale takes over. While Penrose develops into a first-class pilot, he meets Iris Winterton ([[Renee Asherson]]), a young woman living with her domineering aunt at the Golden Lion hotel in the nearby town. Archdale marries Miss Todd ([[Rosamund John]]), the popular manager of the hotel, who is known to everyone as Toddy. The Archdales later have a son, Peter.\n\nThe action flashes forward to May 1942. The squadron is now flying [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Douglas Boston]] bombers. When Penrose shows signs of strain from extensive combat, Archdale has him posted to controller school, but is himself shot down and killed over France on Penrose's last mission. Penrose had been courting Iris, despite her aunt's disapproval, but Archdale's fate weighs heavily on his mind. Not wanting Iris to suffer if the same happened to him, he stops seeing her.\n\nNo. 720 Squadron is sent to the [[Middle East]], but Penrose remains behind as a ground controller for a [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortress]] [[bombardment group]], which takes over the airfield. He befriends USAAF Captain Johnny Hollis ([[Douglass Montgomery]]) and Lieutenant Joe Friselli ([[Bonar Colleano]]). On 17 August 1942, the American airmen participate in the first attack by the USAAF on [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|Occupied France]], later ruefully acknowledging that they underestimated the difficulties involved. Afterwards, Penrose is posted to flying duties with an RAF [[Avro Lancaster]] bomber unit.\n\nIn 1944, Penrose, now a [[squadron leader]] and [[Pathfinder (RAF)|pathfinder]] pilot, makes an emergency landing at Halfpenny Field, where he meets Iris again. Iris had decided to leave her aunt for good and join up. Toddy persuades a still-reluctant Penrose to propose to Iris, saying that she did not regret her own marriage in spite of her husband's death.

A graduate of the [[University of California, San Francisco]], Rao held a Helen Hay Whitney fellowship at [[Harvard University]] and was on the faculty of [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and [[Northwestern University]] before moving back to China to take up the deanship of [[Peking University]]'s School of Life Sciences in 2007. He is currently the director the IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research at Peking University. He took office as the President of the Capital Medical University in June 25, 2019.\n\n==Personal life and education==\nRao was born in [[Jiangxi]] in 1962. In college, he was friends with Mei Lin, who also became a neurobiologist later. In graduate school at [[Shanghai Medical University]], Rao was roommates with {{ill|Lu Bai|zh|\u9c81\u767d}}, now also an eminent neurobiologist.<ref name=\"China20080402\">{{cite news|url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/features/content_14108762.htm|author=Yuan Fang|title=Study overseas: from elite to common people|work=China.org.cn|date=2008-04-02|accessdate=2013-11-11}}</ref> At SMU, his interests began to turn to [[molecular neurobiology]].<ref name=\"ChinaDaily20091014\">{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2009-10/14/content_8789826.htm|author=Gong Yidong|title=Man on a mission|work=China Daily|date=2009-10-14|accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Rao enrolled at the University of California at San Francisco. He describes the atmosphere at UCSF as far more exciting than that to which he had previously been exposed in China.<ref name=\"ChinaDaily20091014\"/> His advisors were Yuh-Nung and Lily Jan. He discovered the ''big brain'' gene, which is required for a binary decision in neural development: to form a neuron or an epidermal cell. He defended his doctoral thesis on molecular and genetic analysis of intercellular communication in ''[[Drosophila]]'' [[neurogenesis]] at UCSF in 1991.<ref>{{harvnb|Rao|1991}}</ref>\n\n==Career and research interests==\nAfter graduating from UCSF, Rao received a Helen Hay Whitney fellowship for postdoctoral research in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Harvard University, where he worked on embryonic induction in vertebrates. He then joined the faculty of [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in 1994, where he established his first laboratory.<ref name=\"ChinaDaily20091014\"/> He moved to [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago in 2004, and was named the university's first Elsa A. Swanson Research Professor in 2006. Other honours he received include the Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fellowship in Neuroscience in 2000, as well as the Charles B. Wilson Brain Tumor Research Excellence Award in Neuroscience. He also served on the editorial board of ''The Journal of Neuroscience'', ''Developmental Biology'', ''Developmental Brain Research'', ''Neuroscience Research''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2006/10/elsa.html|first=Wendy|last=Leopold|title=Yi Rao named Steiner Elsa A.

In 1999, he demonstrated that the secreted protein encoded by the Slit gene was a repellent guidance cue for axons. He has later found that Slit could repel migrating neurons, chemotactic leukocytes and brain tumor cells.

He is currently the director the IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research at Peking University. He took office as the President of the Capital Medical University in June 25, 2019.\n\n==Personal life and education==\nRao was born in [[Jiangxi]] in 1962. In college, he was friends with Mei Lin, who also became a neurobiologist later.

He discovered the ''big brain'' gene, which is required for a binary decision in neural development: to form a neuron or an epidermal cell.

In 1999, he demonstrated that the secreted protein encoded by the Slit gene was a repellent guidance cue for axons. He has later found that Slit could repel migrating neurons, chemotactic leukocytes and brain tumor cells.
