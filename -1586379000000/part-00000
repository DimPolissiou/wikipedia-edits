He began work at the age of 12 and worked on the railways, at the docks and in engineering shops; he was also a commercial traveller.  In 1915, he became a full-time organiser for the [[Workers' Union]], covering a new East Midlands district, serving until 1918,<ref name=\"hyman\">{{cite book |last1=Hyman |first1=Richard |title=The Workers' Union |date=1971 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |page=105}}</ref> when he became an official for the [[National Union of Dock Labourers|National Union of Dock, Riverside and General Workers]].  Following its merger, he transferred into the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]]. At the age of 17, Deer had joined the [[Independent Labour Party]] and he was active in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. His wife, [[Olive Deer|Olive Stoakes]] was also active in the party and was an [[Alderman]] and member of the [[London County Council]].\n\n==Municipal affairs and politics==\nIn 1922 Deer was elected as Labour member of Lincoln City Council where he served for sixteen years and was Mayor in 1933\u201334. He was a Parliamentary candidate at the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]] and [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]] general elections for [[Gainsborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Gainsborough]], and in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]] he fought in [[Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)|Lincoln]] where he lost by 2,684 votes.\n\n==Parliament==\nWhile serving as Sheriff of Lincoln in 1943\u201344, Deer was made a member of the [[Order of British Empire]] in the New Years' Honours list of 1944. He had been reselected as Labour candidate for Lincoln, and in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] he was elected. Deer became popular among fellow MPs, and often took up transport issues which he knew about from his trade union work. He did not rebel against the Labour whip.\n\nAt the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], Deer changed constituencies to [[Newark (UK Parliament constituency)|Newark]], which was adjacent to Lincoln and slightly better for Labour. He was re-elected there, and served as an Opposition Whip from 1955 to 1959. He was selected in the ballot for [[Private Member's Bill]]s in 1957 and introduced a Bill to give supplementary benefits to those who had suffered from industrial injuries before 1948, although it did not succeed.\n\n==Retirement==\nDeer's wife was Chairman of the London County Council in 1962-63 and he accompanied her on the many social occasions to which the Chairman was invited. He retired at the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]]. He died in Grimsby aged 84.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*\"The Times House of Commons 1935\"\n*Obituary, ''The Times'', 17 May 1974\n*M. Stenton and S.

His wife, [[Olive Deer|Olive Stoakes]] was also active in the party and was an [[Alderman]] and member of the [[London County Council]].\n\n==Municipal affairs and politics==\nIn 1922 Deer was elected as Labour member of Lincoln City Council where he served for sixteen years and was Mayor in 1933-34. He was a Parliamentary candidate at the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]] and [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]] general elections for [[Gainsborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Gainsborough]], and in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]] he fought in [[Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)|Lincoln]] where he lost by 2,684 votes.\n\n==Parliament==\nWhile serving as Sheriff of Lincoln in 1943-44, Deer was made a member of the [[Order of British Empire]] in the New Years' Honours list of 1944. He had been reselected as Labour candidate for Lincoln, and in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] he was elected. Deer became popular among fellow MPs, and often took up transport issues which he knew about from his trade union work. He did not rebel against the Labour whip.\n\nAt the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], Deer changed constituencies to [[Newark (UK Parliament constituency)|Newark]], which was adjacent to Lincoln and slightly better for Labour. He was re-elected there, and served as an Opposition Whip from 1955 to 1959. He was selected in the ballot for [[Private Member's Bill]]s in 1957 and introduced a Bill to give supplementary benefits to those who had suffered from industrial injuries before 1948, although it did not succeed.\n\n==Retirement==\nDeer's wife was Chairman of the London County Council in 1962-63 and he accompanied her on the many social occasions to which the Chairman was invited. He retired at the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]]. He died in Grimsby aged 84.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*\"The Times House of Commons 1935\"\n*Obituary, ''The Times'', 17 May 1974\n*M. Stenton and S.

A university classics lecturer by profession, he was elected a Member of Parliament in [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]] and became a significant figure among the party's advocates of [[Zionism]]. He was a [[Bevanism|Bevanite]] on the left of the party, and a long-serving member of Labour's [[National Executive Committee]] (NEC) from 1952. He was a Cabinet minister in [[Harold Wilson]]'s governments of 1964\u20131970, first for Housing, then as Leader of the House of Commons, and then for Social Services.\n\nIn the early 1970s Crossman was editor of the ''[[New Statesman]]''.

The conferences were credited with helping to heal bad memories created by the war. At them, Crossman met the German politician [[Hans von Herwarth]], the ex-soldier [[Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin]], future German President [[Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker]] and other leading German decision makers. Other attendees at the conferences included [[Denis Healey]], soon to become a Labour Party politician, and [[Robin Day]], later a political broadcaster.<ref>[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/15th-august-1992/41/long-life Long Life: Presiding Genius], [[Nigel Nicolson]], 15 August 1992, ''The Spectator'', Retrieved 28 November 2015 ]</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nCrossman entered the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] as the Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Coventry East (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry East]], a seat he held until shortly before he died in 1974. During 1945\u201346 he served, on the nomination of the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Ernest Bevin]], as a member of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into the Problems of European Jewry and Palestine. The committee's report, submitted in April 1946, included a recommendation for 100,000 Jewish [[displaced person]]s to be permitted to enter [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. The recommendation was rejected by the British government, after which Crossman led the socialist opposition to the official British policy for Palestine. That incurred Bevin's enmity, and may have been the primary factor which prevented Crossman from achieving ministerial rank during the 1945\u201351 government. Crossman initially supported the Arab cause, but after meeting [[Chaim Weizmann]] he became a lifelong [[Zionist]]. In his diary, he described Weizmann as \"one of the very few great men I have ever met.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TKv_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA32&dq=richard+crossman+palestine+mission&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAzgKahUKEwj1pLCQ6KLHAhUL1RoKHZM-BVU#v=onepage&q=richard%20crossman%20palestine%20mission&f=true Palestine and the Great Powers, 1945-1948, Michael J.

He was a member of the [[National Executive Committee]] of the Labour Party from 1952 until 1967, and [[Chairman of the Labour Party]] in 1960\u201361.\n\nIn 1957, Crossman was one of the plaintiffs, along with [[Aneurin Bevan]] and [[Morgan Phillips]], in a claim for libel made against ''[[The Spectator]]'', which had described the three men as drinking heavily during a socialist conference in Italy.<ref>\"Messrs Bevan, Morgan Phillips and Richard Crossman... puzzled the Italians by their capacity to fill themselves like tanks with whisky and coffee... Although the Italians were never sure the British delegation were sober, they always attributed to them an immense political acumen.\" See [[Bose, Mihir]], \"Britain's Libel Laws: Malice Aforethought\", ''[[History Today]]'', 5 May 2013.</ref> Having sworn that the charges were untrue, the three collected damages from the magazine. Many years later, Crossman's posthumously published diaries confirmed that ''The Spectator''{{'}}s charges had been true and that all three of them had [[perjury|perjured]] themselves.<ref>[[Roy Jenkins]] wrote of his former colleagues (in \"Aneurin Bevan\" in ''Portraits and Miniatures,'' 2011) that they \"sailed to victory on the unfortunate combination of [[Rayner Goddard, Baron Goddard|Lord Chief Justice Goddard]]'s prejudice against the anti-hanging and generally libertarian ''Spectator'' of those days and the perjury of the plaintiffs, subsequently exposed in Crossman's endlessly revealing diaries.\" [[Geoffrey Wheatcroft]] wrote (in ''The Guardian'', 18 March 2000, \"Lies and Libel\"): \"Fifteen years later, Crossman boasted (in my presence) that they had indeed all been toping heavily, and that at least one of them had been blind drunk.\" [[Dominic Lawson]] wrote (in ''The Independent,'' \"Chris Huhne's downfall is another example of the amazing risks a politician will take\". 4 February 2013): \"Crossman's posthumously published diaries revealed that the story was accurate; and in 1978 [[Brian Inglis]] on ''[[What the Papers Say]]'' revealed that Crossman had told him a few days after the case that they had committed perjury\". Mihir Bose (in \"Britain's Libel Laws: Malice Aforethought\", ''History Today'', 5 May 2013) quotes Bevan's biographer, [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]], to the effect that the case had destroyed the career of the young journalist involved, Jenny Nicholson.</ref>\n\nCrossman was [[Shadow Secretary of State for Education|Labour's spokesman on education]] before the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]], but upon forming the new Government [[Harold Wilson]] appointed him [[Minister of Housing and Local Government]]. In 1966, Crossman became [[Lord President of the Council]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]].\n\nBetween 1968 and 1970 he was the first [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Secretary of State for Health and Social Services]], in which position he worked on an ambitious proposal to supplement Britain's flat-rate state pension with an earnings-related element. The proposal had not, however, been passed into law at the time the Labour Party lost the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]]. During the months of political turmoil that led up to the election loss, Crossman had been considered, however briefly, as a last-minute option to replace Wilson as Prime Minister.\n\n==Books and journalism==\nAfter Labour's general election defeat in 1970, Crossman resigned from the Labour front bench to become editor of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', where he had been a frequent contributor and assistant editor from 1938 until 1955. He left the ''New Statesman'' in 1972.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Crossman also had a regular column titled \"Crossman Says...\" in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', a Labour-supporting tabloid newspaper. Along with the column of [[William Connor|'Cassandra']], Crossman's reporting provided the bulk of political and international commentary in the paper.\n\nCrossman was a prolific writer and editor. In ''Plato To-Day'' (1937) he imagines [[Plato]] visiting Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia. Plato criticises Nazi and Communist politicians for misusing the ideas he had set forth in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.<ref>[[Simon Goldhill|Goldhill, Simon]], ''Love, Sex and Tragedy'', U. Chicago Press, 2004, p. 202</ref> After the war Crossman edited ''[[The God That Failed]]'' (1949), a collection of [[anti-Communist]] essays.\n\nCrossman is best remembered for his colourful and highly subjective three-volume ''Diaries of a Cabinet Minister'', written while he was living in [[Vincent Square]], published posthumously from 1975 to 1977 and covering his time in government from 1964 to 1970. The diaries appeared after he had died, and following a legal battle by the government to block publication. One of Crossman's legal executors was [[Michael Foot]], then a cabinet minister, who opposed his own government's attempts to suppress the diaries.<ref>Anthony Howard [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/7373559/Michael-Foot-The-last-of-a-dying-breed.html Michael Foot: The last of a dying breed] The Telegraph, 5 March 2010</ref> Among other things, the diaries describe Crossman's battles with \"the Dame\", his Permanent Secretary [[Evelyn Sharp, Baroness Sharp]], GBE (1903\u20131985), the first woman in Britain to hold the position. Crossman's backbench diaries were published in 1981.\n\nCrossman's diaries were an acknowledged source for the television comedy series ''[[Yes Minister]]''.<ref name=\"lynnweb\">{{cite web |title=Yes Minister Questions & Answers |work=Jonathan Lynn Official Website |url=http://www.jonathanlynn.com/tv/yes_minister_series/yes_minister_qa.htm |accessdate=6 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119211928/http://www.jonathanlynn.com/tv/yes_minister_series/yes_minister_qa.htm |archivedate=19 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Crossman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Crossman |title=Diaries of a Cabinet Minister: Selections, 1964\u201370 |year=1979 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-241-10142-5}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nCrossman died of [[liver cancer]] on 5 April 1974 at his home in [[Oxfordshire]].

[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician. A university classics lecturer by profession, he was elected a Member of Parliament in [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]] and became a significant figure among the party's advocates of [[Zionism]]. He was a [[Bevanism|Bevanite]] on the left of the party, and a long-serving member of Labour's [[National Executive Committee]] (NEC) from 1952. He was a Cabinet minister in [[Harold Wilson]]'s governments of 1964-1970, first for Housing, then as Leader of the House of Commons, and then for Social Services.\n\nIn the early 1970s Crossman was editor of the ''[[New Statesman]]''. He is remembered for his highly revealing three-volume ''Diaries of a Cabinet Minister'', published posthumously.\n\n==Early life==\nCrossman was born in either [[Cropredy]], Oxfordshire,<ref>Dalyell, 2002</ref> or [[Bayswater]], London,<ref>Howard, 2008</ref> the son of Helen Elizabeth (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' Howard; she was of the Howard family of Ilford descended from [[Luke Howard]], a Quaker chemist and meteorologist who founded the pharmaceutical company Howards and Sons)<ref>Brief Lives with some memoirs, Alan Watkins, Elliot and Thompson, 2004, pp 54-5</ref> and [[Stafford Crossman|Charles Stafford Crossman]],<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=oXwkAAAAMAAJ&q=Helen+Elizabeth+Howard+Charles+Stafford+Crossman&dq=Helen+Elizabeth+Howard+Charles+Stafford+Crossman&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiluKzDs_HJAhXHjIMKHcFoAEwQ6AEIEzAA |title=Biographical Register 1880-1974 - Corpus Christi College (University of Oxford) - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date=3 January 2007 |accessdate=30 September 2018}}</ref> a barrister and later a High Court judge, and grew up in [[Buckhurst Hill]], Essex.\n\nHe was educated at [[Twyford School]], and at [[Winchester College]] (although these scholarships were abolished in 1857,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1533209/The-Reverend-Anthony-Trotman.html |title=The Reverend Anthony Trotman |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=4 November 2006 |accessdate=30 September 2018}}</ref> he was 'founder's kin', being descended from [[William of Wykeham]] through John Danvers, one of his father's ancestors),<ref>Brief Lives with some memoirs, Alan Watkins, Elliot and Thompson, 2004, pg 54</ref><ref name=\"telegraph1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/3160740/Anne-Crossman.html |title=Anne Crossman |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=8 October 2008 |accessdate=30 September 2018}}</ref> where he became [[head boy]]. He excelled academically and on the football field. He studied [[Classics]] at [[New College, Oxford]], receiving a [[double first]] and became a fellow in 1931. He taught philosophy at the university before becoming a lecturer for the [[Workers' Educational Association]]. He was a [[councillor]] on [[Oxford City Council]], and became head of its [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] group in 1935.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nHe had homosexual affairs at university.<ref>{{cite news |author=Michael Bloch |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/16/double-lives-a-history-of-sex-and-secrecy-at-westminster |title=Double lives \u2013 a history of sex and secrecy at Westminster |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=30 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Service in Second World War and afterwards==\nAt the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Crossman joined the [[Political Warfare Executive]] under [[Robert Bruce Lockhart]], where he headed the German Section.<ref>{{cite book |title=In Victory, Magnanimity, in Peace, Goodwill |last=Mayne |first=Richard |isbn=0-7146-5433-7 |date=1 April 2003 |page=6}}</ref> He produced anti-Nazi propaganda broadcasts for Radio of the European Revolution, set up by the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE).

With war correspondent [[Colin Wills]], Crossman co-wrote the script for ''[[German Concentration Camps Factual Survey]]'', a British government documentary, produced by [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]] with treatment advice by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], that showed gruelling scenes from [[Nazi concentration camps]]. The uncompleted film was shelved for decades before being assembled by scholars at the [[Imperial War Museum]] and released in 2014. That same year, ''German Concentration Camps Factual Survey'' was itself the subject of a documentary, ''[[Night Will Fall]]''.<ref name=\"Jeffries\">{{cite news |last1=Jeffries |first1=Stuart |title=The Holocaust film that was too shocking to show |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/09/holocaust-film-too-shocking-to-show-night-will-fall-alfred-hitchcock |accessdate=11 January 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=IWM>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections-research/german-concentration-camps-factual-survey |title=German Concentration Camps Factual Survey |publisher=[[Imperial War Museum]] |accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nCrossman became a key participant in the annual [[K\u00f6nigswinter Conference]], organised by [[Lilo Milchsack]] to bring together British and German [[legislator]]s, academics and opinion-formers from 1950 onwards. The conferences were credited with helping to heal bad memories created by the war. At them, Crossman met the German politician [[Hans von Herwarth]], the ex-soldier [[Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin]], future German President [[Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker]] and other leading German decision makers. Other attendees at the conferences included [[Denis Healey]], soon to become a Labour Party politician, and [[Robin Day]], later a political broadcaster.<ref>[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/15th-august-1992/41/long-life Long Life: Presiding Genius], [[Nigel Nicolson]], 15 August 1992, ''The Spectator'', Retrieved 28 November 2015 ]</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nCrossman entered the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] as the Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Coventry East (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry East]], a seat he held until shortly before he died in 1974. During 1945\u201346 he served, on the nomination of the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Ernest Bevin]], as a member of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into the Problems of European Jewry and Palestine. The committee's report, submitted in April 1946, included a recommendation for 100,000 Jewish [[displaced person]]s to be permitted to enter [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. The recommendation was rejected by the British government, after which Crossman led the socialist opposition to the official British policy for Palestine. That incurred Bevin's enmity, and may have been the primary factor which prevented Crossman from achieving ministerial rank during the 1945\u201351 government. Crossman initially supported the Arab cause, but after meeting [[Chaim Weizmann]] he became a lifelong [[Zionist]]. In his diary, he described Weizmann as \"one of the very few great men I have ever met.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TKv_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA32&dq=richard+crossman+palestine+mission&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAzgKahUKEwj1pLCQ6KLHAhUL1RoKHZM-BVU#v=onepage&q=richard%20crossman%20palestine%20mission&f=true Palestine and the Great Powers, 1945-1948, Michael J. Cohen]</ref>\n\nCrossman was an outspoken supporter of the state of [[Israel]] during his political career from the late 1940s until his death in the mid 1970s.<ref>https://warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/explorefurther/digital/crossman/urss/israel/</ref>\n\nCrossman cemented his role as a leader of the left-wing of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] in 1947 by co-authoring the ''[[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left]]'' pamphlet, and later became one of the more prominent [[Bevanite]]s. He was a member of the [[National Executive Committee]] of the Labour Party from 1952 until 1967, and [[Chairman of the Labour Party]] in 1960\u201361.\n\nIn 1957, Crossman was one of the plaintiffs, along with [[Aneurin Bevan]] and [[Morgan Phillips]], in a claim for libel made against ''[[The Spectator]]'', which had described the three men as drinking heavily during a socialist conference in Italy.<ref>\"Messrs Bevan, Morgan Phillips and Richard Crossman... puzzled the Italians by their capacity to fill themselves like tanks with whisky and coffee... Although the Italians were never sure the British delegation were sober, they always attributed to them an immense political acumen.\" See [[Bose, Mihir]], \"Britain's Libel Laws: Malice Aforethought\", ''[[History Today]]'', 5 May 2013.</ref> Having sworn that the charges were untrue, the three collected damages from the magazine. Many years later, Crossman's posthumously published diaries confirmed that ''The Spectator''{{'}}s charges had been true and that all three of them had [[perjury|perjured]] themselves.<ref>[[Roy Jenkins]] wrote of his former colleagues (in \"Aneurin Bevan\" in ''Portraits and Miniatures,'' 2011) that they \"sailed to victory on the unfortunate combination of [[Rayner Goddard, Baron Goddard|Lord Chief Justice Goddard]]'s prejudice against the anti-hanging and generally libertarian ''Spectator'' of those days and the perjury of the plaintiffs, subsequently exposed in Crossman's endlessly revealing diaries.\" [[Geoffrey Wheatcroft]] wrote (in ''The Guardian'', 18 March 2000, \"Lies and Libel\"): \"Fifteen years later, Crossman boasted (in my presence) that they had indeed all been toping heavily, and that at least one of them had been blind drunk.\" [[Dominic Lawson]] wrote (in ''The Independent,'' \"Chris Huhne's downfall is another example of the amazing risks a politician will take\". 4 February 2013): \"Crossman's posthumously published diaries revealed that the story was accurate; and in 1978 [[Brian Inglis]] on ''[[What the Papers Say]]'' revealed that Crossman had told him a few days after the case that they had committed perjury\". Mihir Bose (in \"Britain's Libel Laws: Malice Aforethought\", ''History Today'', 5 May 2013) quotes Bevan's biographer, [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]], to the effect that the case had destroyed the career of the young journalist involved, Jenny Nicholson.</ref>\n\nCrossman was [[Shadow Secretary of State for Education|Labour's spokesman on education]] before the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]], but upon forming the new Government [[Harold Wilson]] appointed him [[Minister of Housing and Local Government]]. In 1966, Crossman became [[Lord President of the Council]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]].\n\nBetween 1968 and 1970 he was the first [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Secretary of State for Health and Social Services]], in which position he worked on an ambitious proposal to supplement Britain's flat-rate state pension with an earnings-related element. The proposal had not, however, been passed into law at the time the Labour Party lost the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]]. During the months of political turmoil that led up to the election loss, Crossman had been considered, however briefly, as a last-minute option to replace Wilson as Prime Minister.\n\n==Books and journalism==\nAfter Labour's general election defeat in 1970, Crossman resigned from the Labour front bench to become editor of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', where he had been a frequent contributor and assistant editor from 1938 until 1955. He left the ''New Statesman'' in 1972.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Crossman also had a regular column titled \"Crossman Says...\" in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', a Labour-supporting tabloid newspaper. Along with the column of [[William Connor|'Cassandra']], Crossman's reporting provided the bulk of political and international commentary in the paper.\n\nCrossman was a prolific writer and editor. In ''Plato To-Day'' (1937) he imagines [[Plato]] visiting Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia. Plato criticises Nazi and Communist politicians for misusing the ideas he had set forth in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.<ref>[[Simon Goldhill|Goldhill, Simon]], ''Love, Sex and Tragedy'', U. Chicago Press, 2004, p. 202</ref> After the war Crossman edited ''[[The God That Failed]]'' (1949), a collection of [[anti-Communist]] essays.\n\nCrossman is best remembered for his colourful and highly subjective three-volume ''Diaries of a Cabinet Minister'', written while he was living in [[Vincent Square]], published posthumously from 1975 to 1977 and covering his time in government from 1964 to 1970. The diaries appeared after he had died, and following a legal battle by the government to block publication. One of Crossman's legal executors was [[Michael Foot]], then a cabinet minister, who opposed his own government's attempts to suppress the diaries.<ref>Anthony Howard [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/7373559/Michael-Foot-The-last-of-a-dying-breed.html Michael Foot: The last of a dying breed] The Telegraph, 5 March 2010</ref> Among other things, the diaries describe Crossman's battles with \"the Dame\", his Permanent Secretary [[Evelyn Sharp, Baroness Sharp]], GBE (1903\u20131985), the first woman in Britain to hold the position. Crossman's backbench diaries were published in 1981.\n\nCrossman's diaries were an acknowledged source for the television comedy series ''[[Yes Minister]]''.<ref name=\"lynnweb\">{{cite web |title=Yes Minister Questions & Answers |work=Jonathan Lynn Official Website |url=http://www.jonathanlynn.com/tv/yes_minister_series/yes_minister_qa.htm |accessdate=6 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119211928/http://www.jonathanlynn.com/tv/yes_minister_series/yes_minister_qa.htm |archivedate=19 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Crossman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Crossman |title=Diaries of a Cabinet Minister: Selections, 1964\u201370 |year=1979 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-241-10142-5}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nCrossman died of [[liver cancer]] on 5 April 1974 at his home in [[Oxfordshire]].
