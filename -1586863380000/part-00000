(They were not part of the Iroquois Confederacy, initially made up of five tribes south and east of the Great Lakes.) The area of their traditional territory is called [[Huronia (region)|Huronia]]. The Huron in this area were farmers, fishermen and traders who lived in villages surrounded by defensive wooden palisades for protection.<ref name=Athabasca>[http://canadian-writers.athabascau.ca/english/writers/jrelations/martyrs.php \"Canadian Martyrs and Huronia\", Athabasca University]</ref> Sainte-Marie among the Hurons was the headquarters for the French Jesuit Mission to the Huron Wendat people.<ref>[http://www.saintemarieamongthehurons.on.ca/sm/en/Home/index.htm Sainte Marie among the Hurons]</ref>\n\nBy the late 1640s, the Jesuits believed they were making progress in their mission to the Huron, and claimed to have made many converts. But, the priests were not universally trusted.  Many Huron considered them to be malevolent [[shaman]]s who brought death and disease wherever they travelled; after European contact, the Huron had suffered high fatalities in epidemics after 1634 of [[smallpox]] and other Eurasian [[infectious diseases]], to which aboriginal peoples had no immunity. (Epidemiological studies have shown the diseases were likely carried by the increased number of children immigrating after 1634 with families from cities in nations where smallpox was [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], such as France, England and the [[Netherlands]]).\n\nThe nations of the Iroquois Confederacy considered the Jesuits legitimate targets of their raids and warfare, as the missionaries were nominally allies of the Huron and French fur traders. Retaliating for French colonial attacks against the Iroquois was also a reason for their raids against the Huron and Jesuits.\n\nIn 1642, the Mohawk captured [[Ren\u00e9 Goupil]],<ref name=\"puffin.creighton.edu\"/> and Father [[Isaac Jogues]],<ref name=\"Jesuit Relations: 31, VIII\"/> bringing them back to their village of Ossernenon south of the Mohawk River. They ritually tortured both men and killed Goupil. After several months of captivity, Jogues was ransomed by Dutch traders and the minister [[Johannes Megapolensis]] from New Netherland (later Albany). He returned for a time to France, but then sailed back to Quebec.

Around 1040, at the behest of the Croatian kings, a seat of the royal bishop was established in the nearby royal village of Biskupija (Kosovo), in the church of Saint Mary. The first \"bishop of the Croats\" is named ''Marko Giudice'', and he and his successors were attached to the royal court as preachers and king's \"special bishops\" until 1102.<ref>''[[Illyricum sacrum]]'', IV (Venice, 1775)</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=23}}\n\nIn the second half of the 11th century, Knin became a more permanent royal residence of king [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] around 1080.

Due to the extinction of the local ruling dynasty, the Croatian bishop moved his see to Knin itself, after which he started calling himself the Bishop of Knin.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=28}} This precipitated the construction of a new cathedral, which was initiated in 1203 by the son of the Duke of Knin, Dobroslav in Kapitul.\n\nThe city was visited by Queen [[Maria Laskarina]], the daughter of the [[Byzantine Emperor]] and wife of king Bela IV, together with her retinue of nobles and a great number of soldiers in 1261 in order to introduce her son to the Croatian nobility and to negotiate their oath in recognizing him as the designated duke (herceg).{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=32}} In 1264, the first case of judicial function in the city was mentioned and during this time, Knin was the seat of both the Croatian ban, and the duke, who acted as a semi-independent ruler with close connection to the king and whose chancellor had been the bishop of Knin.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=33}} Between 1270 and 1272, the new cathedral was consecrated on the orders of the Knin bishop Nicholas.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1949}}<ref>Nikola Jak\u0161i\u0107, [https://www.academia.edu/22968166/Knin-_hrvatska_srednjovjekovna_prijestolnica_Split_1995 Knin- hrvatska srednjovjekovna prijestolnica, Split 1995] pp. 19</ref> The cathedral is described as being \"magnificent\" and \"solemn\" by subsequent documents.

According to the 19th century Franciscan friar and historian [[Donato Fabianich]], the monastery of [[St. Catharines|Saint Catherine]] was founded around this time by the Knin dignitaries and nobility which were first settled there by Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107.<ref>Donato Fabianich, Storia dei fratri minori dai primordi della joro istituzione in Dal\u00b7 mazia e Bossina, fino ai giorni nostri, I, Zadar 1863, pp. 94.</ref> Their rule over Knin came to an end at the [[Battle of Bliska]] in 1322, after which the Angevin king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] arrived in the city and imprisoned the former lord [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=35}} Upon the departure of the king to Hungary, the noble [[Ivan Nelipi\u0107]] quickly seized Knin, and from there expelled the king's men from Croatia. Thus, these territories ''de facto'' continued to remain outside the monarchy, and the [[Nelipi\u0107 noble family]] made Knin their permanent seat and ruled their territories as \"Princes of Knin\".\n\nAfter successfully warring against their enemies, the Dalmatian cities and nobility under [[George II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Juraj II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]] (who was imprisoned in the castle's dungeons), as well as the royal forces commanded by the [[Ban of Slavonia|Slavonian ban]] ''Mikac Prodani\u0107'',<ref>Miha Madijev, cap.

During this time it became known that the castle consisted of two major parts, administered by two castellans and which was populated by houses and baths, a palace with a main hall used previously by the Nelipi\u0107's to sign an alliance with the [[Republic of Venice]] and to enforce customs on imports to the city.

The previous bishop had likely been expelled, where the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] Mihailo took his place, and was also given the office of the king's chancellor. These actions provoked a retaliation of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], whose armies besieged Knin in September 1390. The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban [[Nicholas II Garai|Nikola Gorjanski]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=60}} In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king [[Stephen Ostoja]], who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king [[Ladislaus of Naples]] attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.\n\nBecause of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]], and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of [[Franciscans]] is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary's church and monastery in the city. Apart from them, other religious buildings are mentioned such as the church of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/>\n\nIts strategic position played an important role in many wars and power changes \u2013 the Republic of Venice often reflected on its importance as a key castle and the main entrance to Dalmatia, which it attempted to obtain during the 15th century.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=64}} During these years both the city, the ban and his dignitaries played a crucial role in the struggle for dominance over the coastal cities with Venice. In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the \"Union and Brotherhood of the Croats\" ({{lang-la|unio et fraternitas Croatorum}}), a congregation of [[Croatian nobility|Croatian nobles]] formed by 12 [[counties of Croatia]] in order to \"preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom\".<ref>Mladen An\u010di\u0107: \"Desetlje\u0107e od 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela\" (Summary: The decade between 1091 and 1102 according to the sources), Povijesni prilozi 17/1998, p. 253</ref><ref>Damir Karbi\u0107: Hrvatski plemi\u0107ki rod i obi\u010dajno pravo, p. 109-111</ref>\n\nIt was in 1420 that the Nelipi\u0107 noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of [[Ivani\u0161 Nelipi\u0107]], which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivani\u0161's death in 1435 by [[Ivan Frankopan|An\u017e]] of the [[House of Frankopan]] through the marriage with the Nelipi\u0107 nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon An\u017e's death in 1437.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=68}} In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as \"capital and foremost place of Croatia\" in their letters.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=72}}\n\nDuring the reign of king [[Matthias Corvinus]], the bishops of Knin were selected as the king's principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading [[Ottoman Empire]]. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the [[pope]] to solicit financial aid for Matthias' military campaign. The city's distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.\n\nIn 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban [[John Corvinus]] and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city's defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Sanjak-bey of Bosnia]], and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell [[vestment]]s to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=82}}\n\n[[File:KninPagano1525.png|thumb|right|280px|Knin castle, settlement and Kapitul around 1525, after Ottoman conquest from the map of Dalmatia from [[Matteo Pagano]]]]\nThe last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=84}} On 20 August 1503 King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan [[Bayezid II]]. The armistice was generally respected by all sides,<ref>[[Ive Ma\u017euran]]: Povijest Hrvatske od 15. stolje\u0107a do 18. stolje\u0107a, p. 44-45</ref> during which Knin's defensive positions were strengthened in 1504. A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin's population.\n\nIn 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion. Baltazar Ba\u0107an ({{lang-hu|Boldizs\u00e1r Batthy\u00e1ny}}), viceban of Slavonia, together with forces from the Zagreb Bishopry, managed to lift the siege of Knin in January 1513. Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops. Knin's burg and outskirts were burned on this occasion.<ref>Vjekoslav Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr\u0161etka XIX. stolje\u0107a, Knjiga \u010detvrta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 302</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=88}} These clashes left Knin devastated and there was no news about the city for five years. Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin's strategic value, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen.

After the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] in 1805, the French Empire gained the city and incorporated it into the [[Illyrian Provinces]] in 1809. By 1813, the Austrians regained control over the town. By the end of the 19th century, as a part of the [[Habsburg]] domain of Dalmatia, Knin grew steadily, becoming an important commercial as well as road and railway center. In 1867, Knin became a part of [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 a territorial entity within [[Cisleithania]]. After the [[First World War]] Knin became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] in 1918, which subsequently became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after 1929).\n\n===Modern===\n[[File:Spomenik hrvatske pobjede Oluja 95 16 obljetnica vojnoredarstvene operacije Oluja 04082011 5047-2.jpg|thumb|left|Monument of the Croatian Victory \"Storm '95\"]]\n{{Expand section|date=June 2016}}\nFrom October 1990,<ref name=\"The war\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/hrvatska/dalmacija/kronologija.htm|title=Kronologija Domovinskog rata u Lici i Sjevernoj Dalmaciji|accessdate=26 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125151650/http://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/hrvatska/dalmacija/kronologija.htm|archivedate=25 November 2014}}</ref> eight months before Croatia [[Croatian War of Independence|declared independence]] (June 25, 1991) from [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], Knin became the main stronghold for the [[Serbs]] in the [[Kninska Krajina|Knin region]], eventually becoming the capital city of the internationally unrecognised [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Knin-Domovinski Rat\">[http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20051126063710/http://www.knin.hr/stranice/o_kninu/domovinski_rat.asp Knin-Domovinski Rat]</ref> The leaders of ''Krajina'' were Knin locals: [[Milan Marti\u0107]] and [[Milan Babi\u0107]], both convicted for [[ethnic cleansing]] of Croats and other non-Serbs from Krajina by [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]].<ref name=\"ICTY judgment\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/martic/tjug/en/070612_summary_en.pdf|title=Summary of Judgement for Milan Marti\u0107|accessdate=18 May 2011|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]}}</ref> Widespread acts of murder and violence, detention and intimidation became pervasive throughout the RSK territory from 1992 to 1995.<ref name=\"ICTY judgment\" /> During that time 93,9% of Croats were expelled from the town and municipality of Knin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://narod.hr/kultura/19-ozujka-1993-knin-znate-li-da-su-srbi-protjerali-iz-grada-i-okolice-cak-94-hrvata|title=18. o\u017eujka 1993.

NK Dinara's colours were black and white until 2005 when the club changed its colours to red, white and blue. NK Dinara plays in the 4th division in Croatia ([[1. \u017dupanijska liga \u0160ibensko-kninska]]). The logo of NK Dinara is red, white, and blue (in that order) with the letter \"D\" in the middle of the logo.\n\nKnin has a sports association which was formed in 1998. [[Basketball]] is also popular in Knin. The Croatian National basketball team has played a match in Knin. They played against [[Israel]] in 1999 where Croatia won the match 78:68. Other sports played in Knin are [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[kickboxing]], [[karate]], [[tennis]]  and [[taekwondo]].\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Station Knin.JPG|thumb|right|Knin railway station building]]\nThe most important intercity roadway in Knin is the Croatian [[D1 (Croatia)|state route D1]]. The route makes for easy access of Knin from the major coastal city of [[Split (city)|Split]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The section of D1 from Knin to [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] highway will be upgraded to the expressway level in following years (with [[B1 (Croatia)|B1]] expressway).\n\nKnin is also an important railway junction as the railroads from the rest of Dalmatia and its cities of [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]] pass through Knin, going north to the capital city of Croatia, [[Zagreb]], via [[M604 railway (Croatia)|M604 railway]]. There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to [[Perkovi\u0107, Croatia|Perkovi\u0107]] (and then to Split or [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]]), to Zadar, to [[Ogulin]] (and onwards to [[Karlovac]], Zagreb) and to [[Martin Brod]] (and [[Biha\u0107]], Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Biha\u0107-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991. However, it is the shortest route between Knin and Zagreb, and as such was electrified in 1984 (the [[overhead line|catenary]] being subsequently destroyed by war operations in the early 1990s). [[Railway electrification system|Electrification]] had started from [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] inland towards the coast and had only reached Knin, so today the Knin station sidings are equipped with overhead catenary, but lines leaving the town are not.\n[[File:\u017deljezni\u010dki-kolodvor-postaja-Knin-05082016-02-roberta-f.jpg|thumb|right|Knin railway station's platforms, notice the lack of catenary wires, and the presence of the poles only]]\n\n==Towns and villages in the municipality==\n\n*[[Golubi\u0107, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Golubi\u0107]]\n*Knin\nBiskupija\n*[[Kninsko Polje]]\n*[[Kova\u010di\u0107, Croatia|Kova\u010di\u0107]]\n*[[Ljuba\u010d, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Ljuba\u010d]]\n*[[O\u0107estovo]]\nOrlic\n*[[Plavno, Croatia|Plavno]]\n*[[Pola\u010da, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Pola\u010da]]\n*[[Potkonje]]\n*[[Radljevac]]\n*[[Strmica, Croatia|Strmica]]\n*[[Vrpolje, Knin|Vrpolje]]\n*[[\u017dagrovi\u0107]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Croatia}}\n* [[Church of Saint Anthony, Knin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|ref={{harvid|ICJ|3 February 2015}}|title=Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.

According to the 19th century Franciscan friar and historian [[Donato Fabianich]], the monastery of [[St. Catharines|Saint Catherine]] was founded around this time by the Knin dignitaries and nobility which were first settled there by Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107.<ref>Donato Fabianich, Storia dei fratri minori dai primordi della joro istituzione in Dal\u00b7 mazia e Bossina, fino ai giorni nostri, I, Zadar 1863, pp. 94.</ref> Their rule over Knin came to an end at the [[Battle of Bliska]] in 1322, after which the Angevin king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] arrived in the city and imprisoned the former lord [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=35}} Upon the departure of the king to Hungary, the noble [[Ivan Nelipi\u0107]] quickly seized Knin, and from there expelled the king's men from Croatia. Thus, these territories ''de facto'' continued to remain outside the monarchy, and the [[Nelipi\u0107 noble family]] made Knin their permanent seat and ruled their territories as \"Princes of Knin\".\n\nAfter successfully warring against their enemies, the Dalmatian cities and nobility under [[George II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Juraj II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]] (who was imprisoned in the castle's dungeons), as well as the royal forces commanded by the [[Ban of Slavonia|Slavonian ban]] ''Mikac Prodani\u0107'',<ref>Miha Madijev, cap.

During this time it became known that the castle consisted of two major parts, administered by two castellans and which was populated by houses and baths, a palace with a main hall used previously by the Nelipi\u0107's to sign an alliance with the [[Republic of Venice]] and to enforce customs on imports to the city.

The previous bishop had likely been expelled, where the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] Mihailo took his place, and was also given the office of the king's chancellor. These actions provoked a retaliation of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], whose armies besieged Knin in September 1390. The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban [[Nicholas II Garai|Nikola Gorjanski]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=60}} In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king [[Stephen Ostoja]], who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king [[Ladislaus of Naples]] attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.\n\nBecause of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]], and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of [[Franciscans]] is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary's church and monastery in the city. Apart from them, other religious buildings are mentioned such as the church of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/>\n\nIts strategic position played an important role in many wars and power changes \u2013 the Republic of Venice often reflected on its importance as a key castle and the main entrance to Dalmatia, which it attempted to obtain during the 15th century.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=64}} During these years both the city, the ban and his dignitaries played a crucial role in the struggle for dominance over the coastal cities with Venice. In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the \"Union and Brotherhood of the Croats\" ({{lang-la|unio et fraternitas Croatorum}}), a congregation of [[Croatian nobility|Croatian nobles]] formed by 12 [[counties of Croatia]] in order to \"preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom\".<ref>Mladen An\u010di\u0107: \"Desetlje\u0107e od 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela\" (Summary: The decade between 1091 and 1102 according to the sources), Povijesni prilozi 17/1998, p. 253</ref><ref>Damir Karbi\u0107: Hrvatski plemi\u0107ki rod i obi\u010dajno pravo, p. 109-111</ref>\n\nIt was in 1420 that the Nelipi\u0107 noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of [[Ivani\u0161 Nelipi\u0107]], which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivani\u0161's death in 1435 by [[Ivan Frankopan|An\u017e]] of the [[House of Frankopan]] through the marriage with the Nelipi\u0107 nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon An\u017e's death in 1437.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=68}} In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as \"capital and foremost place of Croatia\" in their letters.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=72}}\n\nDuring the reign of king [[Matthias Corvinus]], the bishops of Knin were selected as the king's principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading [[Ottoman Empire]]. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the [[pope]] to solicit financial aid for Matthias' military campaign. The city's distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.\n\nIn 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban [[John Corvinus]] and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city's defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Sanjak-bey of Bosnia]], and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell [[vestment]]s to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=82}}\n\n[[File:KninPagano1525.png|thumb|right|280px|Knin castle, settlement and Kapitul around 1525, after Ottoman conquest from the map of Dalmatia from [[Matteo Pagano]]]]\nThe last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=84}} On 20 August 1503 King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan [[Bayezid II]].

A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin's population.\n\nIn 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion. Baltazar Ba\u0107an ({{lang-hu|Boldizs\u00e1r Batthy\u00e1ny}}), viceban of Slavonia, together with forces from the Zagreb Bishopry, managed to lift the siege of Knin in January 1513. Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops. Knin's burg and outskirts were burned on this occasion.<ref>Vjekoslav Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr\u0161etka XIX. stolje\u0107a, Knjiga \u010detvrta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 302</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=88}} These clashes left Knin devastated and there was no news about the city for five years. Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin's strategic value, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen. However, it is unlikely that these forces arrived to the endangered towns.\n\nOn May 29, 1522, [[Siege of Knin|after the final siege]] of the Knin castle, it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=89}} and Croats left the town in large numbers.

By 1813, the Austrians regained control over the town. By the end of the 19th century, as a part of the [[Habsburg]] domain of Dalmatia, Knin grew steadily, becoming an important commercial as well as road and railway center. In 1867, Knin became a part of [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 a territorial entity within [[Cisleithania]]. After the [[First World War]] Knin became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] in 1918, which subsequently became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after 1929).\n\n===Modern===\n[[File:Spomenik hrvatske pobjede Oluja 95 16 obljetnica vojnoredarstvene operacije Oluja 04082011 5047-2.jpg|thumb|left|Monument of the Croatian Victory \"Storm '95\"]]\n{{Expand section|date=June 2016}}\nFrom October 1990,<ref name=\"The war\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/hrvatska/dalmacija/kronologija.htm|title=Kronologija Domovinskog rata u Lici i Sjevernoj Dalmaciji|accessdate=26 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125151650/http://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/hrvatska/dalmacija/kronologija.htm|archivedate=25 November 2014}}</ref> eight months before Croatia [[Croatian War of Independence|declared independence]] (June 25, 1991) from [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], Knin became the main stronghold for the [[Serbs]] in the [[Kninska Krajina|Knin region]], eventually becoming the capital city of the internationally unrecognised [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Knin-Domovinski Rat\">[http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20051126063710/http://www.knin.hr/stranice/o_kninu/domovinski_rat.asp Knin-Domovinski Rat]</ref> The leaders of ''Krajina'' were Knin locals: [[Milan Marti\u0107]] and [[Milan Babi\u0107]], both convicted for [[ethnic cleansing]] of Croats and other non-Serbs from Krajina by [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]].<ref name=\"ICTY judgment\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/martic/tjug/en/070612_summary_en.pdf|title=Summary of Judgement for Milan Marti\u0107|accessdate=18 May 2011|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]}}</ref> Widespread acts of murder and violence, detention and intimidation became pervasive throughout the RSK territory from 1992 to 1995.<ref name=\"ICTY judgment\" /> During that time 93,9% of Croats were expelled from the town and municipality of Knin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://narod.hr/kultura/19-ozujka-1993-knin-znate-li-da-su-srbi-protjerali-iz-grada-i-okolice-cak-94-hrvata|title=18. o\u017eujka 1993.

NK Dinara's colours were black and white until 2005 when the club changed its colours to red, white and blue. NK Dinara plays in the 4th division in Croatia ([[1. \u017dupanijska liga \u0160ibensko-kninska]]). The logo of NK Dinara is red, white, and blue (in that order) with the letter \"D\" in the middle of the logo.\n\nKnin has a sports association which was formed in 1998. [[Basketball]] is also popular in Knin. The Croatian National basketball team has played a match in Knin. They played against [[Israel]] in 1999 where Croatia won the match 78:68. Other sports played in Knin are [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[kickboxing]], [[karate]], [[tennis]]  and [[taekwondo]].\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Station Knin.JPG|thumb|right|Knin railway station building]]\nThe most important intercity roadway in Knin is the Croatian [[D1 (Croatia)|state route D1]]. The route makes for easy access of Knin from the major coastal city of [[Split (city)|Split]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The section of D1 from Knin to [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] highway will be upgraded to the expressway level in following years (with [[B1 (Croatia)|B1]] expressway).\n\nKnin is also an important railway junction as the railroads from the rest of Dalmatia and its cities of [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]] pass through Knin, going north to the capital city of Croatia, [[Zagreb]], via [[M604 railway (Croatia)|M604 railway]]. There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to [[Perkovi\u0107, Croatia|Perkovi\u0107]] (and then to Split or [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]]), to Zadar, to [[Ogulin]] (and onwards to [[Karlovac]], Zagreb) and to [[Martin Brod]] (and [[Biha\u0107]], Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Biha\u0107-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991. However, it is the shortest route between Knin and Zagreb, and as such was electrified in 1984 (the [[overhead line|catenary]] being subsequently destroyed by war operations in the early 1990s).

Through his incorporation of modern and traditional techniques he became the single most influential figure in the revival of [[Irish traditional music]] during the 1960s.\n\n\u00d3 Riada's career began as a music director at [[Radio \u00c9ireann]] from 1954, after which he worked at the [[Abbey Theatre]] from 1955 to 1962. He lectured in music at [[University College Cork]] from 1963 until his death in 1971. He became a household name in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] through his participation in [[Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann]], compositions, writings and broadcasts. His best-known pieces in the classical tradition include ''Nomos No. 1: Hercules Dux Ferrariae'' (1957), but he became particularly famous for his film scores ''Mise \u00c9ire'' (1959) and ''[[Saoirse (\u00d3 Riada)|Saoirse?]]'' (1960). He left a lasting influence as founder and director of the ensemble Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann (from 1961).\n\n\u00d3 Riada died in 1971, two months after his fortieth birthday.<ref>\"[http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/composer-sean-o-riada-died-from-genetic-liver-weakness-26788107.html].

After beginning school in Adare, he later attended [[St Finbarr's College, Farranferris]] and whilst he was there he received musical education from [[Aloys Fleischmann (Senior)]]. He moved to [[St Munchin's College]] in Limerick where he completed his Leaving Certificate in 1948.\n\nHe played violin, piano and organ, and studied Greek and Latin classics at University College Cork, with [[Aloys Fleischmann|Aloys Fleischmann (Junior)]] and graduated in 1952. While at college, \u00d3 Riada was the auditor of the [[UCC Philosophical Society]]. That year he became assistant director for [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|Radio \u00c9ireann]]. He married Ruth Coughlan in 1953.\n\nDuring the evening he played piano with dance bands. In 1955 \u00d3 Riada spent several months in France and consolidated his interest in techniques of musical modernism. On his return in July he became music director of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin (until 1962), where he wrote, arranged and directed music for the small pit orchestra, also continuing his work in radio. Most of his original, modern orchestral compositions were also written in this time, which included his ''Nomos No. 1: Hercules Dux Ferrariae'' for string orchestra (1957), ''Nomos No. 4'' for piano and orchestra (1958) and the ''Triptyche pour orchestre'' (1960) as well as an early version of his ambitious ''Nomos No. 2'' for baritone solo, mixed choir and orchestra (1965). As his work with Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann developed, his engagement with the modern musical avantgarde decreased, but was never abandoned.\n\n==Mise \u00c9ire==\n\u00d3 Riada composed and directed orchestral music for theatre and film, combining [[Traditional Irish music|traditional Irish tunes]] and \"[[Sean-n\u00f3s song|sean-n\u00f3s]]\" (old style) songs in the classical tradition, similar to [[Musical nationalism|nationalist composers]] such as [[Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] (Czech), [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] (Hungarian) and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] (English). In 1959 he scored a documentary film by [[George Morrison (documentary maker)|George Morrison]] called ''[[Mise \u00c9ire]]'' (\"I am Ireland\"), about the founding of the [[Irish Republic]]. The recording is conducted by \u00d3 Riada himself. ''Mise \u00c9ire'' brought him national acclaim and allowed him to start a series of programmes on Irish radio called ''Our Musical Heritage''. \u00d3 Riada told people that one should listen to [[sean-n\u00f3s song]] either as a child would listen or as if they were songs from [[India]].\n\n==Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann==\nBetween 1961 and 1969 \u00d3 Riada led the [[Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann]] group. They played in concert halls dressed in black suits with white shirts and black bow ties, but relied on traditional songs and tunes. An ordinary [[Music of Ireland Traditional music|c\u00e9ilidh band]] or show-band would have musicians who competed with each other to grab the audience's attention. Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann played sparse lucid arrangements. \u00d3 Riada sat in the middle at front playing a harpsichord and a [[bodhr\u00e1n]], a hand-held frame-drum. This was an instrument that had almost died out, being played only by small boys in street parades. Ceil\u00ed bands generally had jazz-band drum-kits. \u00d3 Riada also wanted to use the [[clarsach]] or wire-strung [[harp]] in the band, but as these were as yet unavailable, he played the [[harpsichord]] instead \u2013 in his opinion the nearest sound to a clarsach.<ref name=\"CooperDawe2005\">{{cite book|author1=David Cooper|author2=Kevin Dawe|title=The Mediterranean in Music: Critical Perspectives, Common Concerns, Cultural Differences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di1KQc6-HCwC&pg=PA220|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5407-9|pages=220\u2013}}</ref> The harpsichord he used on a regular basis was made by [[Cathal Gannon]]. Unknown to \u00d3 Riada, Irish folk music was being played ensemble-style in London pubs, but for most people of Ireland this was the first time they heard these tunes played by a band. For some, the membership of Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann overlapped with that of [[The Chieftains]]. They recorded the soundtrack of the film ''[[Playboy of the Western World]]'' (original play by [[John Millington Synge]]) in 1962. Their last public performance was in 1969, the album was then called \"\u00d3 Riada Sa Gaiety\".\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1963 \u00d3 Riada was appointed lecturer in music at [[University College, Cork]]. He moved to Ballyvourney, and not [[C\u00fail Aodha]] (a common misconception) in [[County Cork|West Cork]], an [[Gaeltacht|Irish-speaking area]], where he established [[C\u00f3r Ch\u00fail Aodha]], a male voice choir.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Biletz|first1=Frank A.|title=Historical Dictionary of Ireland|date=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0-8108-7091-6|page=326|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=rb8eAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA326#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> He turned toward choral church music, composing two settings of the [[Mass (music)|Mass]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Gareth|title=Se\u00f3irse Bodley|date=2010|publisher=Field Day Publications|isbn=0-946755-48-5|page=114|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=bqsDoTw8ruAC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> ''Ceol an Aifrinn'' (\"Music of the Mass\") was the first Mass written in the [[Irish language]].

Further works in the \"classical\" tradition include ''Five Epigrams from the Greek Anthology'' (1958) and ''In memoriam Aloys G.

He was flown to [[King's College Hospital]], London, for treatment and died there. He is buried in St [[Gobnait]]'s graveyard, [[Baile Bhuirne]], County Cork. [[Willie Clancy (musician)|Willie Clancy]] played at his funeral.\n\n==Legacy==\nSean \u00d3 Riada and Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann set to music the [[Peadar \u00d3 Doirn\u00edn]] lyric ''[[Women Of Ireland|Mn\u00e1 na h\u00c9ireann]]'', which has been recorded or re-used by many artists. As performed by [[the Chieftains]], it is used as a romantic overture throughout the [[Stanley Kubrick]] movie ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' and is the basis of The Christians' 1989 single ''[[Words (The Christians song)|Words]]''.\n\n\u00d3 Riada's daughter [[Liadh N\u00ed Riada]] was elected as [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] [[Member of the European Parliament]] in [[2014 European Parliament election in Ireland|2014]].<ref>{{cite news|title=N\u00ed Riada's priority is to triple EU funding|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2014/0527/ireland/ni-riadarsquos-priority-is-to-triple-eu-funding-270067.html|accessdate=27 May 2014|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=27 May 2014}}</ref> She was the Sinn F\u00e9in candidate in the [[2018 Irish presidential election|2018 presidential election]].\n\nThe Irish poet Seamus Heaney included the poem \"In Memoriam Sean O'Riada\" in his 1979 collection \"Field Work\".\n\nIn 2008, a life-sized statue was erected in the grounds of S\u00e9p\u00e9il Naomh Gobnait, C\u00fail Aodha.\n[[File:Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada Sculpture.jpg|thumb|Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada Sculpture in C\u00fail Aodha church yard]]\n\nOn 23 April 2010 Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann reformed under the leadership of [[Peadar \u00d3 Riada]] to play a tribute concert to Sean \u00d3 Riada in Dublin's [[Liberty Hall]].\n\n[[File:Paidi O Lionaird.jpg|thumb|P\u00e1id\u00ed \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird opening F\u00e9ile na Laoch]]\nIn 2011, A festival, F\u00e9ile na Laoch, was organised in his honour by his son, Peadar, between 30 September and 3 October in the honour of heroes (laochra) from the seven 'Muses': Storytelling, Sport, Singing, Poetry, Music, Dancing and Acting centring on \u00d3 Riada.\n\nTwo schools are named 'Scoil U\u00ed Riada' after him: a [[Gaelscoil]] in [[Kilcock]], [[Co.

Through his incorporation of modern and traditional techniques he became the single most influential figure in the revival of [[Irish traditional music]] during the 1960s.\n\n\u00d3 Riada's career began as a music director at [[Radio \u00c9ireann]] from 1954, after which he worked at the [[Abbey Theatre]] from 1955 to 1962. He lectured in music at [[University College Cork]] from 1963 until his death in 1971. He became a household name in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] through his participation in [[Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann]], compositions, writings and broadcasts. His best-known pieces in the classical tradition include ''Nomos No. 1: Hercules Dux Ferrariae'' (1957), but he became particularly famous for his film scores ''Mise \u00c9ire'' (1959) and ''[[Saoirse (\u00d3 Riada)|Saoirse?]]'' (1960). He left a lasting influence as founder and director of the ensemble Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann (from 1961).\n\n\u00d3 Riada died in 1971, two months after his fortieth birthday.<ref>\"[http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/composer-sean-o-riada-died-from-genetic-liver-weakness-26788107.html].

After beginning school in Adare, he later attended [[St Finbarr's College, Farranferris]] and whilst he was there he received musical education from [[Aloys Fleischmann (Senior)]]. He moved to [[St Munchin's College]] in Limerick where he completed his Leaving Certificate in 1948.\n\nHe played violin, piano and organ, and studied Greek and Latin classics at University College Cork, with [[Aloys Fleischmann|Aloys Fleischmann (Junior)]] and graduated in 1952. While at college, \u00d3 Riada was the auditor of the [[UCC Philosophical Society]]. That year he became assistant director for [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|Radio \u00c9ireann]]. He married Ruth Coughlan in 1953.\n\nDuring the evening he played piano with dance bands. In 1955 \u00d3 Riada spent several months in France and consolidated his interest in techniques of musical modernism. On his return in July he became music director of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin (until 1962), where he wrote, arranged and directed music for the small pit orchestra, also continuing his work in radio. Most of his original, modern orchestral compositions were also written in this time, which included his ''Nomos No. 1: Hercules Dux Ferrariae'' for string orchestra (1957), ''Nomos No. 4'' for piano and orchestra (1958) and the ''Triptyche pour orchestre'' (1960) as well as an early version of his ambitious ''Nomos No. 2'' for baritone solo, mixed choir and orchestra (1965). As his work with Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann developed, his engagement with the modern musical avantgarde decreased, but was never abandoned.\n\n==Mise \u00c9ire==\n\u00d3 Riada composed and directed orchestral music for theatre and film, combining [[Traditional Irish music|traditional Irish tunes]] and \"[[Sean-n\u00f3s song|sean-n\u00f3s]]\" (old style) songs in the classical tradition, similar to [[Musical nationalism|nationalist composers]] such as [[Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] (Czech), [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] (Hungarian) and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] (English). In 1959 he scored a documentary film by [[George Morrison (documentary maker)|George Morrison]] called ''[[Mise \u00c9ire]]'' (\"I am Ireland\"), about the founding of the [[Irish Republic]]. The recording is conducted by \u00d3 Riada himself. ''Mise \u00c9ire'' brought him national acclaim and allowed him to start a series of programmes on Irish radio called ''Our Musical Heritage''. \u00d3 Riada told people that one should listen to [[sean-n\u00f3s song]] either as a child would listen or as if they were songs from [[India]].\n\n==Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann==\nBetween 1961 and 1969 \u00d3 Riada led the [[Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann]] group. They played in concert halls dressed in black suits with white shirts and black bow ties, but relied on traditional songs and tunes. An ordinary [[Music of Ireland Traditional music|c\u00e9ilidh band]] or show-band would have musicians who competed with each other to grab the audience's attention. Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann played sparse lucid arrangements. \u00d3 Riada sat in the middle at front playing a harpsichord and a [[bodhr\u00e1n]], a hand-held frame-drum. This was an instrument that had almost died out, being played only by small boys in street parades. Ceil\u00ed bands generally had jazz-band drum-kits. \u00d3 Riada also wanted to use the [[clarsach]] or wire-strung [[harp]] in the band, but as these were as yet unavailable, he played the [[harpsichord]] instead \u2013 in his opinion the nearest sound to a clarsach.<ref name=\"CooperDawe2005\">{{cite book|author1=David Cooper|author2=Kevin Dawe|title=The Mediterranean in Music: Critical Perspectives, Common Concerns, Cultural Differences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di1KQc6-HCwC&pg=PA220|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5407-9|pages=220\u2013}}</ref> The harpsichord he used on a regular basis was made by [[Cathal Gannon]]. Unknown to \u00d3 Riada, Irish folk music was being played ensemble-style in London pubs, but for most people of Ireland this was the first time they heard these tunes played by a band. For some, the membership of Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann overlapped with that of [[The Chieftains]]. They recorded the soundtrack of the film ''[[Playboy of the Western World]]'' (original play by [[John Millington Synge]]) in 1962. Their last public performance was in 1969, the album was then called \"\u00d3 Riada Sa Gaiety\".\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1963 \u00d3 Riada was appointed lecturer in music at [[University College, Cork]]. He moved to Ballyvourney, and not [[C\u00fail Aodha]] (a common misconception) in [[County Cork|West Cork]], an [[Gaeltacht|Irish-speaking area]], where he established [[C\u00f3r Ch\u00fail Aodha]], a male voice choir.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Biletz|first1=Frank A.|title=Historical Dictionary of Ireland|date=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0-8108-7091-6|page=326|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=rb8eAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA326#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> He turned toward choral church music, composing two settings of the [[Mass (music)|Mass]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Gareth|title=Se\u00f3irse Bodley|date=2010|publisher=Field Day Publications|isbn=0-946755-48-5|page=114|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=bqsDoTw8ruAC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> ''Ceol an Aifrinn'' (\"Music of the Mass\") was the first Mass written in the [[Irish language]].

Further works in the \"classical\" tradition include ''Five Epigrams from the Greek Anthology'' (1958) and ''In memoriam Aloys G. Fleischmann'' (1964) to words by [[H\u00f6lderlin]]. \u00d3 Riada also set the poetry of [[Thomas Kinsella]] (''Three Poems'', 1954), who returned the favour by praising \u00d3 Riada in verse.\n\nHe became involved in [[Irish politics]] and was a friend of several influential leaders{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}. \u00d3 Riada and his wife Ruth drank regularly at a local pub which still advertises itself as being his local.\n\n==Death==\nHe suffered [[cirrhosis of the liver]]. He was flown to [[King's College Hospital]], London, for treatment and died there. He is buried in St [[Gobnait]]'s graveyard, [[Baile Bhuirne]], County Cork. [[Willie Clancy (musician)|Willie Clancy]] played at his funeral.\n\n==Legacy==\nSean \u00d3 Riada and Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann set to music the [[Peadar \u00d3 Doirn\u00edn]] lyric ''[[Women Of Ireland|Mn\u00e1 na h\u00c9ireann]]'', which has been recorded or re-used by many artists. As performed by [[the Chieftains]], it is used as a romantic overture throughout the [[Stanley Kubrick]] movie ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' and is the basis of The Christians' 1989 single ''[[Words (The Christians song)|Words]]''.\n\n\u00d3 Riada's daughter [[Liadh N\u00ed Riada]] was elected as [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] [[Member of the European Parliament]] in [[2014 European Parliament election in Ireland|2014]].<ref>{{cite news|title=N\u00ed Riada's priority is to triple EU funding|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2014/0527/ireland/ni-riadarsquos-priority-is-to-triple-eu-funding-270067.html|accessdate=27 May 2014|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=27 May 2014}}</ref> She was the Sinn F\u00e9in candidate in the [[2018 Irish presidential election|2018 presidential election]].\n\nThe Irish poet Seamus Heaney included the poem \"In Memoriam Sean O'Riada\" in his 1979 collection \"Field Work\".\n\nIn 2008, a life-sized statue was erected in the grounds of S\u00e9p\u00e9il Naomh Gobnait, C\u00fail Aodha.\n[[File:Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada Sculpture.jpg|thumb|Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada Sculpture in C\u00fail Aodha church yard]]\n\nOn 23 April 2010 Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann reformed under the leadership of [[Peadar \u00d3 Riada]] to play a tribute concert to Sean \u00d3 Riada in Dublin's [[Liberty Hall]].\n\n[[File:Paidi O Lionaird.jpg|thumb|P\u00e1id\u00ed \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird opening F\u00e9ile na Laoch]]\nIn 2011, A festival, F\u00e9ile na Laoch, was organised in his honour by his son, Peadar, between 30 September and 3 October in the honour of heroes (laochra) from the seven 'Muses': Storytelling, Sport, Singing, Poetry, Music, Dancing and Acting centring on \u00d3 Riada.\n\nTwo schools are named 'Scoil U\u00ed Riada' after him: a [[Gaelscoil]] in [[Kilcock]], [[Co.
