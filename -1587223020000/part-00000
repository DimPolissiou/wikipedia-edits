In 1997, environmental [[Public service announcement|PSAs]] were regularly paid for by the government to enhance and promote environmental awareness among the public.\n\nHowever, the ministry's environmental policies remain a subject of ongoing controversy, often criticised for ignoring the health of the environment despite the party's declarations. The PML-N's [[Government of Punjab, Pakistan|provincial government]] in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab Province]] came under intense media, opposition, and public anger after failing to counter the [[2011 dengue outbreak in Pakistan|2011 dengue fever outbreak]] due to its apathy and the inadequacy of steps taken to enforce environmental awareness and regulations. Recently, the prestige of PML-N has suffered after the government's [[Ministry of Health (Pakistan)|Health]] and [[Ministry of Environment (Pakistan)|Environment ministries]] failed to properly inspect the quality of medicines, resulting in major counterfeiting and environmental crises, which put the party's environmental and health policies in great doubt.\n\n===Science and politics===\nThe Pakistan Muslim League (N) is credited for ordering and authorizing the country's first nuclear tests (see ''[[Chagai-I]]'' and ''[[Chagai-II]]'') amid immense international pressure.

Former director general of ISI [[Hamid Gul]] admitted that he formed [[Islami Jamhoori Ittehad|Islami Jamhuri Itehad]] in order to counter the power of [[Pakistan Peoples Party|the Pakistan People's Party]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/760219|title=Hamid Gul accepts responsibility for creating IJI|date=2012-10-30|newspaper=DAWN.COM|access-date=2017-01-04|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104164903/http://www.dawn.com/news/760219|archivedate=4 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Clean-up===\n{{Main|Operation Clean-up}}\nNawaz Sharif, during his first tenure as prime minister of Pakistan (1990-1993), launched a [[military operation]] against his own allies in government, MQM, for allegations against [[Jinnahpur|the Jinnahpur conspiracy]]. Later, the ISPR denied any knowledge of the Jinnahpur conspiracy and separatist maps, which were highly publicized in the media prior to the operation's launch. Thousands of MQM activists were killed, its leadership arrested, and its head, [[Altaf Hussain (Pakistani politician)|Altaf Hussain]], fled to exile in the UK.\n\n===Operation 1998===\nDuring his second term as prime minister (1997-1999), Nawaz Sharif again launched an operation against MQM, who were again in alliance in Sharif's government, on accusations of assassinating [[Hakim Said|Hakeem Said]]. Due to MQM's militant activities and sectarian killings in Karachi, Nawaz Sharif was forced to end the alliance with MQM for the benefit of the nation. An elected PMLN Sindh government in alliance with MQM was dismissed and President's rule was imposed. The operation launched a new era of bloodshed in [[Karachi]] and many party leaders from MQM were arrested. [[Imran Farooq]] (MQM second in command at that time) was forced to flee Pakistan and took political asylum in the UK. Fasih Jugu, who was accused of assassination, was tortured to death by law enforcement officers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/646162-hakim-said-murder-still-shrouded-in-mystery|title=Hakim Said murder still shrouded in mystery|website=www.thenews.com.pk|access-date=2017-01-04|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104164224/https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/646162-hakim-said-murder-still-shrouded-in-mystery|archivedate=4 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The operation resulted in major unrest as the PMLN government tried to nab the criminal elements ravaging the city of Karachi. This was one of the prime excuses the military conjured up for illegally ousting Nawaz Sharif's government in 1999 through martial law.\n\n===Plane hijacking===\nIn 1999, Nawaz Sharif was allegedly involved in the hijacking of a plane carrying then Chief of Army Staff Pervez Musharraf as it was about to land at [[Jinnah International Airport|Karachi airport]], and the control tower ordered the plane not to land in Pakistan but India instead.

In 1997, environmental [[Public service announcement|PSAs]] were regularly paid for by the government to enhance and promote environmental awareness among the public.\n\nHowever, the ministry's environmental policies remain a subject of ongoing controversy, often criticised for ignoring the health of the environment despite the party's declarations. The PML-N's [[Government of Punjab, Pakistan|provincial government]] in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab Province]] came under intense media, opposition, and public anger after failing to counter the [[2011 dengue outbreak in Pakistan|2011 dengue fever outbreak]] due to its apathy and the inadequacy of steps taken to enforce environmental awareness and regulations. Recently, the prestige of PML-N has suffered after the government's [[Ministry of Health (Pakistan)|Health]] and [[Ministry of Environment (Pakistan)|Environment ministries]] failed to properly inspect the quality of medicines, resulting in major counterfeiting and environmental crises, which put the party's environmental and health policies in great doubt.\n\n===Science and politics===\nThe Pakistan Muslim League (N) is credited for ordering and authorizing the country's first nuclear tests (see ''[[Chagai-I]]'' and ''[[Chagai-II]]'') amid immense international pressure.

Former director general of ISI [[Hamid Gul]] admitted that he formed [[Islami Jamhoori Ittehad|Islami Jamhuri Itehad]] in order to counter the power of [[Pakistan Peoples Party|the Pakistan People's Party]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/760219|title=Hamid Gul accepts responsibility for creating IJI|date=2012-10-30|newspaper=DAWN.COM|access-date=2017-01-04|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104164903/http://www.dawn.com/news/760219|archivedate=4 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Clean-up===\n{{Main|Operation Clean-up}}\nNawaz Sharif, during his first tenure as prime minister of Pakistan (1990-1993), launched a [[military operation]] against his own allies in government, MQM, for allegations against [[Jinnahpur|the Jinnahpur conspiracy]]. Later, the ISPR denied any knowledge of the Jinnahpur conspiracy and separatist maps, which were highly publicized in the media prior to the operation's launch. Thousands of MQM activists were killed, its leadership arrested, and its head, [[Altaf Hussain (Pakistani politician)|Altaf Hussain]], fled to exile in the UK.\n\n===Operation 1998===\nDuring his second term as prime minister (1997-1999), Nawaz Sharif again launched an operation against MQM, who were again in alliance in Sharif's government, on accusations of assassinating [[Hakim Said|Hakeem Said]]. Due to MQM's militant activities and sectarian killings in Karachi, Nawaz Sharif was forced to end the alliance with MQM for the benefit of the nation. An elected PMLN Sindh government in alliance with MQM was dismissed and President's rule was imposed. The operation launched a new era of bloodshed in [[Karachi]] and many party leaders from MQM were arrested. [[Imran Farooq]] (MQM second in command at that time) was forced to flee Pakistan and took political asylum in the UK. Fasih Jugu, who was accused of assassination, was tortured to death by law enforcement officers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/646162-hakim-said-murder-still-shrouded-in-mystery|title=Hakim Said murder still shrouded in mystery|website=www.thenews.com.pk|access-date=2017-01-04|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104164224/https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/646162-hakim-said-murder-still-shrouded-in-mystery|archivedate=4 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The operation resulted in major unrest as the PMLN government tried to nab the criminal elements ravaging the city of Karachi. This was one of the prime excuses the military conjured up for illegally ousting Nawaz Sharif's government in 1999 through martial law.\n\n===Plane hijacking===\nIn 1999, Nawaz Sharif was allegedly involved in the hijacking of a plane carrying then Chief of Army Staff Pervez Musharraf as it was about to land at [[Jinnah International Airport|Karachi airport]], and the control tower ordered the plane not to land in Pakistan but India instead.

The squadron departed on 10 April, arriving on 17 and landing troops; the British garrison retreated to [[St. Philip's Castle]] and was forced to surrender after the [[Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)|Siege of Fort St Philip]].<ref name=cunat25>Cunat, p.25</ref> Patrolling between [[Menorca]] and [[Mallorca]] to prevent British relief to support Fort St. Philip, La Galissoni\u00e8re intercepted a 13-ship squadron under [[John Byng|Admiral Byng]], leading to the [[Battle of Minorca (1756)|Battle of Minorca]]. The British failed to break the French blockade, and Fort St. Philip fell on 29 July.<ref name=cunat26>Cunat, p.26</ref>\n\nIn 1757, Suffren transferred to the 80-gun [[French ship Oc\u00e9an (1756)|''Oc\u00e9an'']], flagship of a 6-ship and 2-frigate squadron under [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La Clue-Sabran]].

During the north-east monsoon he would not go to the islands but refitted in the Malay ports in Sumatra, and returned with the south-west [[monsoon]] in 1783. Hyder Ali was dead, but [[Tipu Sahib|Tipu Sultan]], his son, was still at war with the Company. Bussy arrived and landed.

Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports.

{"title_page": "History of deaf education", "text_new": "The [[deaf]] community over time has worked to improve the educational system for those who are deaf and hard of hearing. The '''history of deaf education''' dates back to [[Ancient Egypt]] where the deaf were respected and revered. In contrast, those who were deaf in [[Ancient Greece]] were considered a burden to society and put to death. The educational aspects of the deaf community has evolved tremendously and still continues to grow as the science of [[linguistics]], [[educational research]], new technologies, and laws, on local, national, and international levels are steadily being introduced. Strategies, however, remain controversial.\n\n==Ancient Egypt==\nDuring the [[Before Christ|BC]] era, the [[Disability|disabled]] were not harmed or killed by the Egyptians despite the fact that they had [[birth defect]]s. This is because the Egyptians lived by a [[philanthropic]] way of life. Many of the disabled citizens displayed talents that were not easily acquired. The deaf were considered to be especially selected by the gods because of their peculiar behavior. This behavior was a direct result of their disability to hear and desire to communicate. They were treated respectfully and educated, usually through the use of [[hieroglyphs]] and [[gesture]] signs.<ref name=\"The History of Deaf People\">{{cite book|last=Eirksson|first=Per|title=The History of Deaf People|year=1993|publisher=SHI Laromedel, the Learning Materials Division of the National Swedish Agency for Special Education|location=Orebro Sweden|pages=12|isbn=9163068222}}</ref>\n\n==Ancient Greece==\n[[Sign language]] was first documented in ancient Greece. In one of [[Plato]]'s dialogues he describes how the deaf used gestures to mimic moving objects through similar motions. Plato quotes his teacher [[Socrates]] in the [[Cratylus]] as follows: \"if we had neither voice nor tongue, and yet wished to manifest things to one another, should we not, like those which are at present mute, endeavor to signify our meaning by the hands, head, and other parts of the body?....I think, therefore that if we wished to signify that which is upwards and light, we should raise our hands towards the heaven, imitating the nature of the thing itself; but that if we wished to indicate things downwards and heavy, we should point with our hands to the earth...\" <ref name=\"Deafness, a Personal Account\">{{cite book|last=Wright|first=David|title=Deafness, a Personal Account|year=1969|publisher=Allen Lane the Penguin Press|location=London|pages=156}}</ref> Unlike ancient Egypt, the Greeks felt it was better to kill anyone with a disability. The deaf were especially considered a burden in [[Athens]], where it was believed that anyone who would be a \"burden to society\" should be put to death. The city of Athens felt that ending the lives of those impaired was in the best interests of the state. This was because war and conflict occurred continuously and certain abilities were considered important to have. Everyone was meant to serve the state.<ref name=\"The History of Deaf People\"/> Philosopher [[Aristotle]] along with Greek physician [[Galen]] concluded that the deaf could never speak, believing that the ability to speak and hear were linked; being derived from the same area in the brain. Galen, feeling that if one capability was impaired the other would be impaired also, was considered to be correct. Additionally Aristotle's views, which were similarly related to Galen's, were also viewed as accurate and this idea went unchallenged until the sixteenth century A.D.<ref name=\"The History of Deaf People\"/>\n\n==16th century==\n===Pedro Ponce de Leon, a Spanish Benedictine monk===\n\nDuring the mid-sixteenth century brothers Pedro and Francisco Fernandez Velasco y Tovar, were sent to live in a [[monastery]] by the name of Ona where they were under the guidance of [[Pedro Ponce de Leon]]. The two brothers belonged to one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in [[Spain]]. At that time, the noble families sent their disabled children to monasteries because it was believed that the children's disabilities were directly related to the sins of the parents. For this reason, the families hid their children because they were ashamed. During this time ten percent of children born to noble families were deaf. This was because noble families in Spain during this time married their blood relatives to keep the wealth within the family. The Velasco boys were placed under the care of Ponce because of their attachment to him when they arrived at the [[monastery]]. Ponce himself had become attached to the boys and decided to educate them.<ref name=\"A Silent Minority\">{{cite book|last=Plann|first=Susan|title=A Silent Minority: deaf education in Spain, 1550 -1835|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|location=London, England|pages=1\u201310|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udHE4CEe8vkC&pg=PP13&dq=%22Pedro+Ponce+de+Leon%22++deaf+education#v=onepage&q=%22Pedro%20Ponce%20de%20Leon%22%20%20deaf%20education&f=false|isbn=9780520204713}}</ref> Many critics credit Ponce with being the first person to educate the deaf, but it is stated by Van Cleve in ''Deaf History Unveiled'' that he was in fact not the first person to educate the deaf but the first person to teach the deaf to speak. He then argues that a monk from La Estrella, whose name is not given, is the first person that should be credited with educating the deaf.<ref name=\"Deaf History Unveiled\">{{cite book|last=Van Cleve|first=John Vickrey|title=Deaf History Unveiled|url=https://archive.org/details/deafhistoryunvei00vanc|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=Gallaudet University Press|location=Washington DC|pages=[https://archive.org/details/deafhistoryunvei00vanc/page/1 1\u2013288]}}</ref> Contrastingly in the ''History of Deaf People'' written by Per Eriksson, he credits [[John of Beverley|St. John of Beverley]] with being the first person to educate the deaf. St. John was the [[Archbishop of York|bishop of York]], England around 700 A.D. He is considered to be the first to disagree with Aristotle's opinion of a deaf person's ability to learn.<ref name=\"The History of Deaf People\"/>\n\n===Sign language===\n\nCommunication came from both the homes of the deaf in addition to the monasteries they were sent to.<ref name=\"The History of Deaf People\"/>\n\n==19th century==\n===Advocates===\nThomas Fox was born on November 16, 1859. He became deaf at age ten after having [[meningitis|spinal meningitis]]. Soon after his parents enrolled him in the [[New York School for the Deaf]] in which he became a part of the deaf community. After leaving the New York School for the Deaf he enrolled in [[Gallaudet College]] in 1879. During his time at Gallaudet, Fox went to a meeting for the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]]. While at this meeting Fox became a promoter of deaf values. This was due to the offensive preconceptions against deaf people made in an attempt to remove certain cultural aspects of the deaf community. However, the specifics of the criticisms were not mentioned in detail. Fox wanted deaf schools to remain active, along with the job availability for deaf instructors and [[language interpretation]] within the classes. After graduating from Gallaudet he returned to his grade school in New York to teach. After his retirement he remained involved in the school's activities until his death in 1945.<ref name=\"Signs of Resistance\">{{cite book|last=Burch|first=Susan|title=Signs of Resistance|year=2002|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|pages=8, 9}}</ref>\n\n==20th century==\n\n=== Equality ===\nDuring the early 1900s membership to various deaf organizations was denied to [[African Americans]]. Associations and even some churches prevented African Americans from becoming members including the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf. There were fewer people to relate to who shared the same ethnic background and many of the Caucasian deaf leaders made no attempt to improve the quality of the black deaf community. During this time racism was more prevalent and there were perhaps shared views of the blacks by both hearing and deaf white males. Because of this [[National Black Deaf Advocates]] was formed. In addition discrimination was also made against deaf women. Colleges produced more male graduates than female, and deaf females were completely excluded or had only limited access to various club affiliations. They were also given easier workloads by teachers. Associations at national and state levels had no or only small amounts of actual participation by women. Women were often allowed to give their opinions or share their ideas for support of the preservation of sign language and the deaf community, but they did not hold any authoritative positions that allowed them to make decisions on behalf of the deaf community. Even though they had a tough time being heard, deaf women still continued to seek involvement in language and cultural preservation. They eventually begin to establish their own clubs and organizations in which they expressed their ideas and views on issues concerning the deaf community. Associations such as the [[Camp Fire Girls]] at state schools and the OWLs at Gallaudet College were formed in support of deaf women of Caucasian ethnicity.\n\n=== Cochlear implant ===\nThe [[cochlear implant]] is a device surgically implanted in the skull that provides stimulation to the nerve to promote hearing. It is a prosthetic with wires attached to the [[cochlea]] and is located behind the ear. The cochlear implant has a microphone, connecting cables, a speech processor, and a battery. The processor converts sounds into electrical impulses by taking information from sound patterns and producing an electrical pulse in the ear of the host. Although the implant does provide an artificial means by which its hosts can hear, this is not the same as a [[hearing aid]] because it does not elevate sound. With this implant, sounds are not the same as sounds that a hearing person experiences.<ref name=\"Cochlear Implant\">{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=Innovations for the Hearing Impaired|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/hstartinventions/a/deaf_4.htm|work=Cochlear Implant- Bionic Ear|publisher=About.com|accessdate=11/5/2011}}</ref> Teaching recipients to understand the sounds they hear takes years and there is no guarantee they will be able to make sense of the information. Therefore the cochlear implant is not able to give all deaf people hearing and speech.<ref name=\"Deaf Studies Today\">{{cite journal|last=King|first=J. Freeman|title=The Cochlear Implantation of Deaf Children|journal=Deaf Studies Today: A Kaleidoscope of Knowledge, Learning and Understanding|year=2005|pages=225\u2013232}}</ref>\n\n===Economic/Job opportunities===\nDuring the mid to late 20th century, a study showed that two-thirds of American adults with disabilities did not have a job. It was also found that around eighty percent of those unemployed had the desire to work. Employers often said they did not provide adequate accommodations for those with disabilities. They were also unsure if they could trust those persons with disabilities to perform requested tasks correctly.  As result of these problems the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA) of 1990 was ratified. This prevented [[discrimination]] against those with disabilities in both private and governmental business sectors. Furthermore the ADA placed the responsibility of providing needed accommodations on the employer.<ref name=\"Job/Ecomomics\">{{cite web|last=Scherich|first=Dayl L.|title=Job Accommodations in the Workplace for Persons Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing: Current Practices and Recommendations|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5002268637|publisher=Gale, Cengage Learning|accessdate=11/2/11}}</ref>\n\n==21st century==\n\n{{Empty section|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Efforts around the world==\n===China===\nSince more individuals with disabilities live in [[China]] than any other country in the world, special education has become an important area of focus. China once had great ideological resources in this field; yet, the schools for the disabled created in the late nineteenth century were established by Western [[missionaries]]. Since the late nineteen hundreds the legislation has expressed its concern and made efforts to encourage the progress of [[Special education in China|special education]] in China.<ref name=China>{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Hanlin|author2=Wang, HongBo|title=Special Education In China|journal=The Journal of Special Education|year=1994|volume=28|series=93-105|pages=1\u2013191|url=http://sed.sagepub.com/content/28/1/93.short|accessdate=11/4/11}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]], efforts have been made to adopt a [[Bilingual\u2013bicultural education|bilingual-bicultural model of education]], using [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) as its standard language for instruction. It is assumed that this approach will lead to an enhancement in learning, expression and achievement in deaf students.<ref name=Canada>{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Connie|title=Can The Linguistic Interdependence Theory Support a Bilingual-Bicultural Model of Literacy Education for Deaf Students|journal=Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|volume=1|issue=2|pages=93\u2013107|url=http://jdsde.oxfordjournals.org/content/1/2/93.full.pdf|pmid=15579815|year=1996|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.deafed.a014290}}</ref>\n===Australia===\nNational and worldwide legislation has focused an increasing amount of attention on the values of [[Inclusion (education)|inclusion]]. This attitude is geared toward those with disabilities. Inclusive education has been accepted and implemented to prevent and reduce biased attitudes concerning students with disabilities. [[UNESCO]]\u2019s education policy was approved at the Salamanca Conference in 1944 and establishes the privilege to education for all disabled students. It has been considered a basic [[Human rights|human right]] despite the fact that disabled students will need adequate [[Reasonable accommodation|accommodations]]. The international focus has been placed on the Rights of Children (1989) as well. World leaders have made a commitment to find ways to increase the number of children who attend school. In result the national policies have been impacted by these developments. In [[Australia]], the viewpoint of education has been modeled after those international trends. Australia has made efforts to see that all of their students are educated. Moreover the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992|Disability Discrimination Act of 1992]] has played an important role in support of education for the disabled as well.<ref name=Australia>{{cite journal|last=Subban|first=Pearl|author2=Umesh Sharma |author3=Monash University |title=PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS' PERCEPTIONS OF INCLUSIVE EDUCATION IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA|journal=International Journal of Special Education|year=2006|volume=21|series=1|pages=1}}</ref> Australia has presented itself as a country in great support of human rights. This act was implemented with the intent to secure the rights of the disabled. Additionally the Disability Discrimination Act has three key purposes: to discourage discrimination, to promote equality for the disabled before the law, and to insure the acceptance of the disabled by communities.<ref name=\"Law and Change\">{{cite book|last=Tyler|first=Melissa Conley|title=Law and Change|pages=212|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mulr19&div=17&g_sent=1&collection=journals}}</ref>\n\n===Africa===\n[[South Africa]]\u2019s constitution and the Integrated National Disability Strategy along with other legislation claims to be one of the most proactive methods in support of the disable. Yet, most of the sentimentality does not exceed policy level and the enforcement of these guidelines has trailed far behind.<ref name=\"South Africa\">{{cite book|last=Glaser|first=Meryl|title=Telecommunications Bridging Between Deaf and Hearing Users in South Africa|year=2001|pages=2|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu}}</ref>\n\n==ASL training==\n[[American Sign Language]] (ASL) is used in both the [[United States]] and in English speaking parts of Canada. Although it is produced with gestures and seen with the eyes. Because ASL does not require the use of voice or the ability to hear, it is used by deaf people, as well as people who have trouble communicating through spoken language, whether due to physical limitations or due to intellectual disabilities. Sign language is not globally consistent; instead it is similar to other languages in that the signs used in various sign languages are regional and steeped in culture. \nThough English is spoken in both Great Britain and the United States, American Sign Language and [[British Sign Language]] are in fact rather dissimilar. ASL actually has greater similarity to [[French Sign Language]] because American Sign Language has its origin in French Sign Language, but today, they are distinctive and different from one another. A common misunderstanding is that ASL can be directly translated to the English language. This is false, because English and American Sign Language do not share the same grammar or syntax. Contrary to what has been presumed sign languages do have a specific format. They are not just different signs representing a word combined together to create speech. As oral languages have a particular format in which the words are presented, sign languages has its own format as well. Just as errors are made in the English language with a slight mispronunciation or mistaken letter arrangement, ASL can have the same errors with just a slight difference in gestures that are similar. This does not mean that grammar rules of oral language is in any way directly related to that of sign language, but the same concept can be taken into account. Although we can compare the processes of developing ASL with that of the spoken English language the difference between the two must be recognized. The qualitative factor of ASL is much different from English in form. The largely sequential phonetic structure of oral languages, with relatively few [[suprasegmental feature]]s, contrasts with a greater degree of simultaneity in sign languages. Sign languages have four simultaneously realized parameters: hand configuration, location, movement and orientation.<ref name=ASL>{{cite journal|last=Frishberg|first=Nancy|title=Arbitrariness and Iconicity: Historical Change in American Sign Language|journal=Language|volume=51|issue=3|year=1975|publisher=Linguistic Society of America|location=Washington DC|pages=696\u2013719|jstor=412894|doi=10.2307/412894}}</ref> Hand configuration, location and movement are what determine what is being signed. A simple combination of words can differ in just location, movement, or the way in which you hold your hand as you are signing.<ref name=\"ASL\"/>\n\n== Preservation of sign language ==\nThe deaf community made continuous efforts to help preserve sign language communication as oralists made many attempts to suppress the language and promote oral communication. The attempt to supplant sign language, by the hearing, lead to the production of dictionaries and films intended to expose and promote sign language in the oral community as well as the deaf. Many deaf people spent most of their free time socializing with their deaf peers and joined clubs within the deaf community after graduating from school. Their efforts continued in the promotion of the preservation of sign language.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comit\u00e9 International des Sports des Sourds]]\n* [[History of deaf education in the United States]]\n* [[History of deaf education in Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Deaf education]]\n", "text_old": "The [[deaf]] community over time has worked to improve the educational system for those who are deaf and hard of hearing.

After his retirement he remained involved in the school's activities until his death in 1945.<ref name=\"Signs of Resistance\">{{cite book|last=Burch|first=Susan|title=Signs of Resistance|year=2002|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|pages=8, 9}}</ref>\n\n==20th century==\n\n=== Equality ===\nDuring the early 1900s membership to various deaf organizations was denied to [[African Americans]]. Associations and even some churches prevented African Americans from becoming members including the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf. There were fewer people to relate to who shared the same ethnic background and many of the Caucasian deaf leaders made no attempt to improve the quality of the black deaf community. During this time racism was more prevalent and there were perhaps shared views of the blacks by both hearing and deaf white males. Because of this [[National Black Deaf Advocates]] was formed. In addition discrimination was also made against deaf women. Colleges produced more male graduates than female, and deaf females were completely excluded or had only limited access to various club affiliations. They were also given easier workloads by teachers. Associations at national and state levels had no or only small amounts of actual participation by women. Women were often allowed to give their opinions or share their ideas for support of the preservation of sign language and the deaf community, but they did not hold any authoritative positions that allowed them to make decisions on behalf of the deaf community. Even though they had a tough time being heard, deaf women still continued to seek involvement in language and cultural preservation. They eventually begin to establish their own clubs and organizations in which they expressed their ideas and views on issues concerning the deaf community. Associations such as the [[Camp Fire Girls]] at state schools and the OWLs at Gallaudet College were formed in support of deaf women of Caucasian ethnicity.\n\n=== Cochlear implant ===\nThe [[cochlear implant]] is a device surgically implanted in the skull that provides stimulation to the nerve to promote hearing. It is a prosthetic with wires attached to the [[cochlea]] and is located behind the ear. The cochlear implant has a microphone, connecting cables, a speech processor, and a battery. The processor converts sounds into electrical impulses by taking information from sound patterns and producing an electrical pulse in the ear of the host. Although the implant does provide an artificial means by which its hosts can hear, this is not the same as a [[hearing aid]] because it does not elevate sound. With this implant, sounds are not the same as sounds that a hearing person experiences.<ref name=\"Cochlear Implant\">{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=Innovations for the Hearing Impaired|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/hstartinventions/a/deaf_4.htm|work=Cochlear Implant- Bionic Ear|publisher=About.com|accessdate=11/5/2011}}</ref> Teaching recipients to understand the sounds they hear takes years and there is no guarantee they will be able to make sense of the information. Therefore the cochlear implant is not able to give all deaf people hearing and speech.<ref name=\"Deaf Studies Today\">{{cite journal|last=King|first=J.

It was also found that around eighty percent of those unemployed had the desire to work. Employers often said they did not provide adequate accommodations for those with disabilities. They were also unsure if they could trust those persons with disabilities to perform requested tasks correctly.  As result of these problems the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA) of 1990 was ratified. This prevented [[discrimination]] against those with disabilities in both private and governmental business sectors. Furthermore the ADA placed the responsibility of providing needed accommodations on the employer.<ref name=\"Job/Ecomomics\">{{cite web|last=Scherich|first=Dayl L.|title=Job Accommodations in the Workplace for Persons Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing: Current Practices and Recommendations|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5002268637|publisher=Gale, Cengage Learning|accessdate=11/2/11}}</ref>\n\n==21st century==\n\n{{Empty section|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Efforts around the world==\n===China===\nSince more individuals with disabilities live in [[China]] than any other country in the world, special education has become an important area of focus. China once had great ideological resources in this field; yet, the schools for the disabled created in the late nineteenth century were established by Western [[missionaries]]. Since the late nineteen hundreds the legislation has expressed its concern and made efforts to encourage the progress of [[Special education in China|special education]] in China.<ref name=China>{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Hanlin|author2=Wang, HongBo|title=Special Education In China|journal=The Journal of Special Education|year=1994|volume=28|series=93-105|pages=1\u2013191|url=http://sed.sagepub.com/content/28/1/93.short|accessdate=11/4/11}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]], efforts have been made to adopt a [[Bilingual\u2013bicultural education|bilingual-bicultural model of education]], using [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) as its standard language for instruction. It is assumed that this approach will lead to an enhancement in learning, expression and achievement in deaf students.<ref name=Canada>{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Connie|title=Can The Linguistic Interdependence Theory Support a Bilingual-Bicultural Model of Literacy Education for Deaf Students|journal=Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|volume=1|issue=2|pages=93\u2013107|url=http://jdsde.oxfordjournals.org/content/1/2/93.full.pdf|pmid=15579815|year=1996|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.deafed.a014290}}</ref>\n===Australia===\nNational and worldwide legislation has focused an increasing amount of attention on the values of [[Inclusion (education)|inclusion]]. This attitude is geared toward those with disabilities. Inclusive education has been accepted and implemented to prevent and reduce biased attitudes concerning students with disabilities. [[UNESCO]]\u2019s education policy was approved at the Salamanca Conference in 1944 and establishes the privilege to education for all disabled students. It has been considered a basic [[Human rights|human right]] despite the fact that disabled students will need adequate [[Reasonable accommodation|accommodations]]. The international focus has been placed on the Rights of Children (1989) as well. World leaders have made a commitment to find ways to increase the number of children who attend school. In result the national policies have been impacted by these developments. In [[Australia]], the viewpoint of education has been modeled after those international trends. Australia has made efforts to see that all of their students are educated. Moreover the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992|Disability Discrimination Act of 1992]] has played an important role in support of education for the disabled as well.<ref name=Australia>{{cite journal|last=Subban|first=Pearl|author2=Umesh Sharma |author3=Monash University |title=PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS' PERCEPTIONS OF INCLUSIVE EDUCATION IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA|journal=International Journal of Special Education|year=2006|volume=21|series=1|pages=1}}</ref> Australia has presented itself as a country in great support of human rights. This act was implemented with the intent to secure the rights of the disabled. Additionally the Disability Discrimination Act has three key purposes: to discourage discrimination, to promote equality for the disabled before the law, and to insure the acceptance of the disabled by communities.<ref name=\"Law and Change\">{{cite book|last=Tyler|first=Melissa Conley|title=Law and Change|pages=212|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mulr19&div=17&g_sent=1&collection=journals}}</ref>\n\n===Africa===\n[[South Africa]]\u2019s constitution and the Integrated National Disability Strategy along with other legislation claims to be one of the most proactive methods in support of the disable. Yet, most of the sentimentality does not exceed policy level and the enforcement of these guidelines has trailed far behind.<ref name=\"South Africa\">{{cite book|last=Glaser|first=Meryl|title=Telecommunications Bridging Between Deaf and Hearing Users in South Africa|year=2001|pages=2|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu}}</ref>\n\n==ASL training==\n[[American Sign Language]] (ASL) is used in both the [[United States]] and in English speaking parts of Canada. Although it is produced with gestures and seen with the eyes. Because ASL does not require the use of voice or the ability to hear, it is used by deaf people, as well as people who have trouble communicating through spoken language, whether due to physical limitations or due to intellectual disabilities. Sign language is not globally consistent; instead it is similar to other languages in that the signs used in various sign languages are regional and steeped in culture. \nThough English is spoken in both Great Britain and the United States, American Sign Language and [[British Sign Language]] are in fact rather dissimilar. ASL actually has greater similarity to [[French Sign Language]] because American Sign Language has its origin in French Sign Language, but today, they are distinctive and different from one another. A common misunderstanding is that ASL can be directly translated to the English language. This is false, because English and American Sign Language do not share the same grammar or syntax. Contrary to what has been presumed sign languages do have a specific format. They are not just different signs representing a word combined together to create speech. As oral languages have a particular format in which the words are presented, sign languages has its own format as well. Just as errors are made in the English language with a slight mispronunciation or mistaken letter arrangement, ASL can have the same errors with just a slight difference in gestures that are similar. This does not mean that grammar rules of oral language is in any way directly related to that of sign language, but the same concept can be taken into account. Although we can compare the processes of developing ASL with that of the spoken English language the difference between the two must be recognized. The qualitative factor of ASL is much different from English in form. The largely sequential phonetic structure of oral languages, with relatively few [[suprasegmental feature]]s, contrasts with a greater degree of simultaneity in sign languages. Sign languages have four simultaneously realized parameters: hand configuration, location, movement and orientation.<ref name=ASL>{{cite journal|last=Frishberg|first=Nancy|title=Arbitrariness and Iconicity: Historical Change in American Sign Language|journal=Language|volume=51|issue=3|year=1975|publisher=Linguistic Society of America|location=Washington DC|pages=696\u2013719|jstor=412894|doi=10.2307/412894}}</ref> Hand configuration, location and movement are what determine what is being signed. A simple combination of words can differ in just location, movement, or the way in which you hold your hand as you are signing.<ref name=\"ASL\"/>\n\n== Preservation of sign language ==\nThe deaf community made continuous efforts to help preserve sign language communication as oralists made many attempts to suppress the language and promote oral communication. The attempt to supplant sign language, by the hearing, lead to the production of dictionaries and films intended to expose and promote sign language in the oral community as well as the deaf. Many deaf people spent most of their free time socializing with their deaf peers and joined clubs within the deaf community after graduating from school. Their efforts continued in the promotion of the preservation of sign language.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Comit\u00e9 International des Sports des Sourds]]\n*[[History of deaf education in the United States]]\n*[[History of Deaf Education in Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Deaf education]]\n", "name_user": "Zanimum", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_deaf_education"}

After four weeks of incubation, a 30% loss in LSD concentration at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C and up to a 40% at 45&nbsp;\u00b0C were observed. Urine fortified with LSD and stored in amber glass or nontransparent polyethylene containers showed no change in concentration under any light conditions. Stability of LSD in transparent containers under light was dependent on the distance between the light source and the samples, the wavelength of light, exposure time, and the intensity of light. After prolonged exposure to heat in alkaline pH conditions, 10 to 15% of the parent LSD epimerized to iso-LSD. Under acidic conditions, less than 5% of the LSD was converted to iso-LSD. It was also demonstrated that trace amounts of metal ions in buffer or urine could catalyze the decomposition of LSD and that this process can be avoided by the addition of [[EDTA]].\n\n===Detection===\nLSD may be quantified in urine as part of a [[Drug test|drug abuse testing program]], in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Both the parent drug and its major metabolite are unstable in biofluids when exposed to light, heat or alkaline conditions and therefore specimens are protected from light, stored at the lowest possible temperature and analyzed quickly to minimize losses.<ref>R.

Lambert and the Gorgettes, from the album ''Abbra Cadaver'', 1967}}\nA similar and connected nexus of LSD use in the creative arts developed around the same time in [[London]]. A key figure in this phenomenon in the UK was British academic [[Michael Hollingshead]], who first tried LSD in America in 1961 while he was the Executive Secretary for the Institute of British-American Cultural Exchange. After being given a large quantity of pure Sandoz LSD (which was still legal at the time) and experiencing his first \"trip,\" Hollingshead contacted [[Aldous Huxley]], who suggested that he get in touch with Harvard academic [[Timothy Leary]], and over the next few years, in concert with Leary and [[Richard Alpert]], Hollingshead played a major role in their famous LSD research at [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]] before moving to New York City, where he conducted his own LSD experiments. In 1965 Hollingshead returned to the UK and founded the World Psychedelic Center in [[Chelsea, London]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{Main|LSD art}}\nIn both music and art, the influence of LSD was soon being more widely seen and heard thanks to the bands that participated in the Acid Tests and related events, including [[the Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], and through the inventive poster and album art of San Francisco-based artists like [[Rick Griffin]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Bonnie MacLean]], [[Stanley Mouse]] & [[Alton Kelley]], and [[Wes Wilson]], meant to evoke the visual experience of an LSD trip. LSD had a strong influence on the Grateful Dead and the culture of \"[[Deadhead]]s.\"<ref name=Jarnow/>\n\nAmong the many famous people in the UK that Michael Hollingshead is reputed to have introduced to LSD are artist and [[Hipgnosis]] founder [[Storm Thorgerson]], and musicians [[Donovan]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[John Lennon]], and [[George Harrison]]. Although establishment concern about the new drug led to it being declared an illegal drug by the Home Secretary in 1966, LSD was soon being used widely in the upper echelons of the British art and music scene, including members of [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Moody Blues]], the [[Small Faces]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and others, and the products of these experiences were soon being both heard and seen by the public with singles like the Small Faces' \"[[Itchycoo Park]]\" and LPs like the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and Cream's ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'', which featured music that showed the obvious influence of the musicians' recent psychedelic excursions, and which were packaged in elaborately-designed album covers that featured vividly-coloured psychedelic artwork by artists like [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], [[Martin Sharp]], [[Hapshash and the Coloured Coat]] ([[Nigel Waymouth]] and [[Michael English (illustrator)|Michael English]]) and art/music collective [[The Fool (design collective)|The Fool]].\n\nIn the 1960s, musicians from [[psychedelic music]] and [[psychedelic rock]] bands began to refer (at first indirectly, and later explicitly) to the drug and attempted to recreate or reflect the experience of taking LSD in their music.

By classifying LSD as a Schedule I substance, the DEA holds that LSD meets the following three criteria: it is deemed to have a high potential for abuse; it has no legitimate medical use in treatment; and there is a lack of accepted safety for its use under medical supervision. There are no documented deaths from chemical [[toxicity]]; most LSD deaths are a result of behavioral toxicity.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1011615|LSD Toxicity}}</ref>\n\nThere can also be substantial discrepancies between the amount of chemical LSD that one possesses and the amount of possession with which one can be charged in the US. This is because LSD is almost always present in a medium (e.g. blotter or neutral liquid), and in some contexts, the amount that can be considered with respect to sentencing is the total mass of the drug and its medium. This discrepancy was the subject of 1995 [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''Neal v. United States'', which determined that for finding minimum sentence lengths, the total medium weight is used, while for determining the severity of the offense, an estimation of the chemical mass is used.<ref>{{cite court| litigants=Neal v.

After four weeks of incubation, a 30% loss in LSD concentration at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C and up to a 40% at 45&nbsp;\u00b0C were observed. Urine fortified with LSD and stored in amber glass or nontransparent polyethylene containers showed no change in concentration under any light conditions. Stability of LSD in transparent containers under light was dependent on the distance between the light source and the samples, the wavelength of light, exposure time, and the intensity of light. After prolonged exposure to heat in alkaline pH conditions, 10 to 15% of the parent LSD epimerized to iso-LSD. Under acidic conditions, less than 5% of the LSD was converted to iso-LSD. It was also demonstrated that trace amounts of metal ions in buffer or urine could catalyze the decomposition of LSD and that this process can be avoided by the addition of [[EDTA]].\n\n===Detection===\nLSD may be quantified in urine as part of a [[Drug test|drug abuse testing program]], in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Both the parent drug and its major metabolite are unstable in biofluids when exposed to light, heat or alkaline conditions and therefore specimens are protected from light, stored at the lowest possible temperature and analyzed quickly to minimize losses.<ref>R.

Lambert and the Gorgettes, from the album ''Abbra Cadaver'', 1967}}\nA similar and connected nexus of LSD use in the creative arts developed around the same time in [[London]]. A key figure in this phenomenon in the UK was British academic [[Michael Hollingshead]], who first tried LSD in America in 1961 while he was the Executive Secretary for the Institute of British-American Cultural Exchange. After being given a large quantity of pure Sandoz LSD (which was still legal at the time) and experiencing his first \"trip,\" Hollingshead contacted [[Aldous Huxley]], who suggested that he get in touch with Harvard academic [[Timothy Leary]], and over the next few years, in concert with Leary and [[Richard Alpert]], Hollingshead played a major role in their famous LSD research at [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]] before moving to New York City, where he conducted his own LSD experiments. In 1965 Hollingshead returned to the UK and founded the World Psychedelic Center in [[Chelsea, London]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{Main|LSD art}}\nIn both music and art, the influence of LSD was soon being more widely seen and heard thanks to the bands that participated in the Acid Tests and related events, including [[the Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], and through the inventive poster and album art of San Francisco-based artists like [[Rick Griffin]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Bonnie MacLean]], [[Stanley Mouse]] & [[Alton Kelley]], and [[Wes Wilson]], meant to evoke the visual experience of an LSD trip. LSD had a strong influence on the Grateful Dead and the culture of \"[[Deadhead]]s.\"<ref name=Jarnow/>\n\nAmong the many famous people in the UK that Michael Hollingshead is reputed to have introduced to LSD are artist and [[Hipgnosis]] founder [[Storm Thorgerson]], and musicians [[Donovan]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[John Lennon]], and [[George Harrison]]. Although establishment concern about the new drug led to it being declared an illegal drug by the Home Secretary in 1966, LSD was soon being used widely in the upper echelons of the British art and music scene, including members of [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Moody Blues]], the [[Small Faces]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and others, and the products of these experiences were soon being both heard and seen by the public with singles like the Small Faces' \"[[Itchycoo Park]]\" and LPs like the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and Cream's ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'', which featured music that showed the obvious influence of the musicians' recent psychedelic excursions, and which were packaged in elaborately-designed album covers that featured vividly-coloured psychedelic artwork by artists like [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], [[Martin Sharp]], [[Hapshash and the Coloured Coat]] ([[Nigel Waymouth]] and [[Michael English (illustrator)|Michael English]]) and art/music collective [[The Fool (design collective)|The Fool]].\n\nIn the 1960s, musicians from [[psychedelic music]] and [[psychedelic rock]] bands began to refer (at first indirectly, and later explicitly) to the drug and attempted to recreate or reflect the experience of taking LSD in their music.

By classifying LSD as a Schedule I substance, the DEA holds that LSD meets the following three criteria: it is deemed to have a high potential for abuse; it has no legitimate medical use in treatment; and there is a lack of accepted safety for its use under medical supervision. There are no documented deaths from chemical [[toxicity]]; most LSD deaths are a result of behavioral toxicity.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1011615|LSD Toxicity}}</ref>\n\nThere can also be substantial discrepancies between the amount of chemical LSD that one possesses and the amount of possession with which one can be charged in the US. This is because LSD is almost always present in a medium (e.g. blotter or neutral liquid), and in some contexts, the amount that can be considered with respect to sentencing is the total mass of the drug and its medium. This discrepancy was the subject of 1995 [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''Neal v. United States'', which determined that for finding minimum sentence lengths, the total medium weight is used, while for determining the severity of the offense, an estimation of the chemical mass is used.<ref>{{cite court| litigants=Neal v.
