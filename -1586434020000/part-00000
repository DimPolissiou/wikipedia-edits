It was formerly known simply as ''Jade'' or ''Jahde''. Because of the very low input of freshwater, it is classified as a bay rather than an [[estuary]].<ref>G\u00fcnther Lang, Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Wasserbau (Federal Bureau for Water-Bound Constructions): ''Ein Beitrag zur Tidedynamik der Innenjade und des Jadebusens (A contribution on the tidal dynamics of Innenjade and Jadebusen)'' (in German)</ref>\n\n==Intrusion of the sea==\nAbout 180&nbsp;km\u00b2 (70&nbsp;mi\u00b2) in area, the Jade was largely created by [[storm flood]]s during the 13th and 16th centuries. Since the early 14th century, it has joined eastward to the [[estuary]] of the river [[Weser]]. For some time, there were three permanent connecting branches and one flood bed between the river and the bight, forming an [[River delta#Tide-dominated deltas|estuarine delta]]. The first of these junctions was closed in 1450 by [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] and the last one in 1515. However, about a century passed before most of the area flooded by these connections was regained for pasture and arable land.\n\nIn the west, the Jade extended far into the [[East Frisia|Frisian peninsula]]. From the early 16th century, a number of dikes were built against the storm floods and to gain arable land. The main dike, ''Ellenser Damm'', was built between 1596 and 1615 by the [[Duchy of Oldenburg|County of Oldenburg]] before the agreement with the objecting [[County of East Frisia]] was finished successfully.\n\n==Decay of the Frisian community==\nThe extension of Jade Bight and its branches fragmented the free [[Frisians|Frisian]] territory of [[R\u00fcstringen]] in ''Bant'' in the northwest, most of which has disappeared in the waves, ''Bovenjadingen'' ('above the Jade') with the low [[moraine]] hills of [[Friesische Wehde]] in the southwest, [[Butjadingen]] ('outside the Jade') in the northeast, which was an island for almost two centuries, and ''[[Stadland]]'' ('bank-land'), which became a narrow island along the left bank of the Weser in 1384. The devastation by floods and the losses of land weakened the Frisian community. In the years about 1400, the [[Free City of Bremen]] tried to rule Standland and Butjadingen. At the beginning of 16th century, all countries around Jade Bight were conquered by the Counts of Oldenburg.\n\n==Organized construction of dikes==\nTogether with the conquest of the island of Stadland, the [[Lockfleth]], the largest branch of the Weser delta, was interrupted by a dike at [[Ovelg\u00f6nne]] in 1515. In the next years the water course was cut off at more sites. The most important projects prior to 1650 were the Ellenser Damm across the Schwarzes Brack in the west of the bay in 1596 to 1615 and the New Hoben-Dike in the east in 1643. South of this dike, the coast became a mossy bog. The bog was affected by high floods, and dikes built on the bog proved to be very fragile.\n\n==Harbour==\n[[Tide|Tidal]] flows make the neck of Jade Bight the deepest natural channel near Germany's North Sea coast. In 1853, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] bought a part of the western shore of the bay from Oldenburg, in order to use the harbour as a Prussian naval base, later called [[Wilhelmshaven]]. During [[World War I]], the German [[High Seas Fleet]] (''Hochseeflotte''), the main battle fleet of the Imperial German Navy ([[Kaiserliche Marine]]), was based at Wilhelmshaven in the Jade Bight. After [[World War II]], Wilhelmshaven became the main German port for the import of petrol.\n\n==Nature==\nThe foreshore areas of Jade Bight form a part of the German [[Wadden Sea National Parks]].\n\n[[Image:SatJadebusen-Wesermuendung.jpg|thumb|left|Jadebusen and river Weser estuary]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{clear|left}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Karl-Ernst Behre: ''Die Geschichte der Landschaft um den Jadebusen'', Brune-Mettker GmbH, Wilhelmshaven 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-941929-02-9}}\n* Karl-Ernst Behre: ''Das Moor von Sehestedt \u2212 Landschaftsgeschichte am \u00f6stlichen Jadebusen''.

Dyer's casting was announced on 1 October 2013 with that of his on-screen partner/Wife, [[Linda Carter]], played by [[Kellie Bright]]. He is the son of established character [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and a member of the Carter family. Mick immediately becomes the new landlord of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], bringing Linda, their son [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny Carter]] ([[Sam Strike]]/[[Ted Reilly]]) and pet bulldog [[Lady Di (EastEnders)|Lady Di]] with him. They are later joined by daughter [[Nancy Carter]] ([[Maddy Hill]]), son [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny Hatchard|Danny-Boy Hatchard]]) and other members of the extended family.\n\nThe character was created by [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]], who came up with the idea of the Carter family before he became the executive producer of ''EastEnders''. The character was influenced by Treadwell-Collins' own father. Dyer was asked to play Mick and he accepted because the role was not typical of other roles he has played, and he was happy that Mick's partner would be played by Bright. Mick is described as a family man who is patriotic and kind, and it was said that he has a good partnership with Linda but they fight \"like teenagers\".\n\nMick's storylines have included overcoming his fear of water, taking the blame for soliciting after being arrested, the discovery that Shirley is not his sister but actually his mother, coping with Linda's rape by his brother [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]), the death of his grandfather [[Stan Carter]] ([[Timothy West]]) from terminal cancer, becoming a father to [[Ollie Carter]], blaming Nancy when Ollie is seriously injured during a fight between her and Lee, discovering that Lee instigated a robbery at The Queen Vic, ongoing financial issues and developing feelings for his daughter-in-law, [[Whitney Dean|Whitney Carter]] ([[Shona McGarty]]). Dyer took a short break from the show in early 2017.<!--Do not add Dyer's control renewal, it is featured in development--> Mick has also feuded with former friend [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]) and was framed by Stuart for his attempted murder \u2013 a storyline which helped to aid Dyer's short break in 2018. Dyer took another break from the show in 2019 and was absent for two months.\n\nDyer's casting received a mixed response, with Daniel Kilkelly from [[Digital Spy]] feeling positive about the new character but calling it a risk, as Dyer is so well known, Vicky Prior from the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' saying Dyer could be \"the saviour of the soap\", and Ally Ross from ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' opining that Dyer could do better because of the show's recent drop in ratings. Several critics, as well as Dyer himself, hoped that he would help increase the show's ratings, but the casting was criticised by domestic violence charities because of previous comments Dyer was alleged to have made. Dyer has won several awards for the role including the [[TV Choice Award]] for Best Soap Actor in 2014 and [[National Television Award]] for Outstanding Serial Drama Performance in 2015, 2016 and 2019.\n\n== Storylines ==\nMick is first mentioned when his sisters, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]), visit his partner [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) at Linda's mother, [[Elaine Peacock]]'s ([[Maria Friedman]]) pub in [[Watford]].

After Stan suffers a fall, Linda persuades Mick to check on Stan. Mick discovers there has been a break in and disturbs the thief, who punches him and flees. Mick suspects that it was his son [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]), who may have run away from serving in the army in Afghanistan. Mick visits Stan in the hospital and enquires about Lee, and Stan assures him that he has not seen Lee. Mick leaves the hospital angry after Stan asks to stay at The Queen Vic, but Tina is angry to find out that Stan is in hospital and Mick has not told her. Tina brings Stan to The Queen Vic to stay for three weeks. Mick reluctantly agrees and is further angered when Stan makes derogatory comments about both Tina and Johnny's homosexualities and about the dangers faced by Lee in the army. Stan also tells Mick about a time when his mother tried to drown him in the bath when he was an infant.\n\nMick and Stan's relationship starts to thaw, annoying Shirley. Mick attempts to reunite Shirley with her estranged son, [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]), with little success. Tina refers to the incident involving a young Mick in the bathtub, citing the event as happening after their mother left. This confuses Mick, and he concludes that it was Stan who tried to kill him and attacks him, prompting Shirley to admit that she had attempted to drown him. [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) finds out from Shirley that Mick is actually her son, his father is a man named Andy and her mother [[Sylvie Carter]] ([[Linda Marlowe]]) concealed the pregnancy and brought Mick up as her and Stan's son. Shirley warns Phil not to tell Mick. Despite not being able to swim and having a phobia of water, Mick signs up to a sponsored swim in aid of his friend [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]]'s ([[Perry Fenwick]]) young daughter, [[Janet Mitchell]] (Grace), who has [[Down's syndrome]]. He starts to learn at the local swimming pool, and confesses his fear to his friend, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]).

Linda becomes cold towards him and refuses to have sex; Mick deduces that she is pregnant. She denies this, but he discovers Linda is pregnant and is planning to have a secret abortion. After a discussion, they agree to keep the baby. Stan reveals he has terminal prostate cancer, leading Mick to enlist Dean's help in tracking down Shirley to try and convince her to return. They find her staying in a caravan with [[Buster Briggs]] ([[Karl Howman]]) and she soon returns. Mick and Shirley find that Shirley and Tina's mother, Sylvie, is staying with her sister [[Babe Smith]] ([[Annette Badland]]). Babe reveals that Sylvie has [[Alzheimer's disease]].\n\nMick plans to propose to Linda, but Linda reveals to Mick that Dean raped her. Dean claims that he and Linda had an affair, so Mick attacks Dean. To stop the attack, Shirley reveals that Dean and Mick are brothers and she is Mick's mother, and it emerges that Buster is Mick's father as well as Dean's. Linda claims that their relationship can survive as long as nobody else finds out that she was raped. She eavesdrops while Mick, Tina, Shirley, Babe and Stan argue, only to hear Mick deny that Dean is part of the family. Mick tells Stan and Tina that Dean raped Linda. When he realises Linda has left, a despairing and devastated Mick smashes up the bar. Mick and Linda later report the rape to the police. When Mick learns that Shirley was forced to keep the secret of being his mother out of fear that she would never see him again, he decides to give her another chance, as long as Dean keeps his distance from him. He is shocked to learn that Stan wants him and Tina to help him die and stops Tina from doing so. The next week, Dean is arrested and released on bail. He refuses to leave Walford on Shirley's insistence until Mick orders him to.\n\nDean returns and sneaks into the pub's cellar, intending to set fire to it, and taking Nancy hostage. Mick stops him and chokes him until he is unconscious, but Dean goes missing after this. Linda proposes to Mick and he accepts. Nancy believes Mick has killed Dean, until Dean returns. Linda gives birth prematurely to [[Ollie Carter]] after falling down the stairs. Dean believes the baby is his until Mick discovers he, Linda and Ollie share the same blood group, but Dean's is different, meaning Dean cannot be Ollie's father. Mick and Buster then start to bond. Mick and Linda bring Ollie home, where Mick ejects Dean after he attempts to shake Linda's hand. Mick and Shirley reunite when they scatter Stan's ashes. Dean starts a relationship with [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), so her sister [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) tries to get Mick to help her get rid of Dean, but he refuses to help. Mick lies to his family so he can take Ollie to see Shirley, but they soon find out and Linda is initially not happy. Dean attempts to rape Roxy when she ends the relationship; Shirley witnesses this and realises Dean did rape Linda, and she tries to drown him but is unsuccessful. At Mick and Linda's wedding, Dean arrives and tries to drown Shirley in a lake, but Mick rescues Shirley and then resuscitates Dean after he nearly drowns, wanting him to face punishment. Dean is arrested, and Mick and Linda get married.\n\nWhen they return from their honeymoon, they discover that Lee's girlfriend, [[Whitney Dean]]'s ([[Shona McGarty]]), brother [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) has stolen \u00a35,000 from the safe.

An undercover police officer becomes a regular customer, and eventually Mick, Babe and Shirley are arrested, charged and fined \u00a320,000 in court. Babe leaves Sylvie near the canal, in an attempt to let her drown; when Sylvie is found, it is revealed Babe is responsible and Mick evicts her after she starts insulting Linda. The next day, Mick is disgusted to learn that Lee had hit Whitney during a row and confides in Shirley who suggest that Lee and Whitney should be separated for Whitney's safety, which he regretfully tells Lee. Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a note saying he no longer loves her, but Mick persuades him to explain to her his reasons before going. With Babe missing, Mick no is no longer required to pay her share of the fine, however, realising that Mick cannot pay the fine as well as other debts, including bills for the repair of leaks in the pub, Shirley decides to put the blame for the licence break on herself. As the fine is unpaid, Shirley is jailed and subsequently charged with perverting the cause of justice, which increases her sentence from six weeks to three months. A few days later, Ian's wife, [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) calls Linda, worried about Mick. Linda returns the following day and Mick informs her of Lee's departure and the debts he has left. Linda initially blames Whitney and an argument ensues, causing Whitney to storm out. Mick explains to Linda that it was Lee's fault, causing another argument between the two although they later make up and have sex. After a heart-to-heart with Whitney, Linda decides to return to Elaine, which angers Mick as Linda saw the state he was in and left anyway. Soon after Linda's departure, Mick receives a phone call from Tamwar saying that Nancy has been critically injured after being hit by a car while backpacking in Bulgaria. He immediately leaves Walford and flies to Bulgaria to be with her.\n\nIn Mick's absence, Linda hires a new bar manager, [[Woody Woodward (EastEnders)|Woody Woodward]] ([[Lee Ryan]]) and agrees with Shirley to sell The Queen Vic's freehold in order to solve their financial problems. Mick returns and walks in on Whitney and Woody in bed after having sex. He then punches Woody and throws him out. He later learns that Shirley and Linda sold the freehold of The Queen Vic behind his back and forged his signature, and turns to alcohol to deal with the stress. He also learns that [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) set up the deal, and confronts him, branding him a snake and warning him to stay away from him. He then kisses a vulnerable Whitney who responds. Shirley learns of the kiss and tells Whitney to pack her bags and leave. When Mick learns that Shirley did this, he drunkenly throws a glass at her, but instantly regrets it and cries, saying he no longer knows himself. Mick tells Linda about the kiss on her return but is then left devastated when she tells him their relationship is over. Later, Linda agrees to give Mick another chance but when her admits he made a failed attempt to pay Whitney off with \u00a3200, Linda slaps him. Following a reconciliation and a holiday, Mick discovers Linda had cancer and did not tell him, so he leaves her. However, they get back together the following day. The freeholders of the pub, Grafton Hill, demand \u00a360,000 for structural repairs, saying they will be evicted if they do not pay. Business consultant [[Fi Browning]] ([[Lisa Faulkner]]) tells them she has reduced it to \u00a350,000, which they manage to raise. However, [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]) claims to own the pub, and Fi, his daughter, denies reducing the debt; the family are given a month to leave the pub. They tell James they will take the company to court, but James reveals that he knows Mick's signature was forged on the paperwork, so the Carters start looking for a new home. Mick turns down a pub in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] after meeting [[Aidan Maguire]] ([[Patrick Bergin]]), who is arranging a robbery and he manipulates Mick into joining his team, along with Phil, [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) and [[Keanu Taylor]] ([[Danny Walters (actor)|Danny Walters]]). Mick is shot in the arm by [[Callum \"Halfway\" Highway]] (Tony Clay) during the heist and is treated by [[Mariam Ahmed]] (Indira Joshi). Mick recovers, but the money they stole then goes missing. Halfway, who is an army friend of Lee's, moves into The Queen Vic, and the Carters are able to buy back the pub from Fi when Halfway gives them a ring he stole during the heist that is worth \u00a3200,000. This causes Aidan to suspect Mick of stealing the money, so he has a drug dealer start dealing from the Vic's toilets. When Mick tries to stop this, Aidan threatens to take The Queen Vic from them, as he has already taken The Albert bar from Vincent, and also threatens to hurt Johnny, who has moved away, and Nancy. Linda has the drug dealer arrested so Aidan threatens to have Mick killed. [[Mel Owen]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]) gives Mick the number of a hitman, and when Mick discovers Aidan has covered The Queen Vic hallway as well as Ollie in petrol, the Carters agree to contact him to get rid of Aidan, but Linda stops it. The Carters then prepare to leave for Watford but Mick returns to The Queen Vic at the last minute to confront Aidan. He stands up to Aidan but Aidan beats him with his cane. He's stopped when Jack, Billy, Linda, Shirley and Ted barge in and stop him. Aidan calls on his henchman and he threatens to set the pub on fire unless Mick makes an apology. He's forced to say sorry and Aidan leaves but gets punched by Phil and is warned off by Phil's knowledge that Aidan murdered [[Luke Browning]] (Adam Astill), giving back the Carters control of The Queen Vic.\n\nMick's childhood friend and Halfway's brother, [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]), arrives in Walford but Linda dislikes him. Mick tells Linda that Stuart went to a Young Offender Institute after covering for something Mick did when they were 13 and Linda has to accept their friendship. When [[Shakil Kazemi]] ([[Shaheen Jafargholi]]) is stabbed, Mick fails to realise he needs help so is devastated when he dies and blames himself. Mick sees pictures of and messages to schoolgirls on Stuart's phone and confronts Stuart, who says he has done nothing wrong, but Mick reports him to the police. Stuart explains that he poses as underage girls online to expose paedophiles and the police know about it. Stuart enlists Mick's help in confronting paedophiles, and Stuart reveals that he suffered sexual abuse from an officer when he was in the Young Offender Institute. Mick says Stuart should track the man down, but Stuart wants to protect girls from abuse now. Mick agrees to help but the confrontation goes wrong, but it emerges that the man is Stuart's friend and they were testing Mick. Mick is humiliated and Stuart says Mick cannot handle it and adds that he saved Mick from abuse by taking the blame for what Mick did when they were teenagers and calls Mick a coward. Mick and Stuart then have a physical fight. Stuart asks Halfway to help to confront someone but Mick urges Halfway not to go and joins them when he sees Halfway leaving. Stuart asks Halfway to confront the man, [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Fred Lewis|Fred Lewis]], but Mick tries to stop him and the commotion causes Fred to run. Mick and Halfway follow Fred on the tube and Mick concludes that Stuart has made a mistake and Fred is not a paedophile. He tells Stuart this, but Stuart posts the confrontation video regardless. After Fred is assaulted and hospitalised, Mick gives Stuart an alibi but the police explain that Fred was trying to track down his daughter online. Stuart and Mick fight again and Stuart insists he is right about Fred. Mick tells Stuart to post a retraction video, which Stuart does but he believes that Mick needs to be hurt in the same way Stuart was in the Young Offender Institute. Stuart shoots himself and frames Mick, who is arrested and remanded. Linda starts to believe that Mick shot Stuart, ejects Tina from The Queen Vic, allows Stuart to move in and calls a solicitor to initiate divorce proceedings. However, this is actually part of Linda's secret plan to help get Mick out of prison. Linda records Stuart admitting that Mick did not shoot him and he is released from prison. Mick takes Stuart to an abandoned factory where he vows to kill him. Mick is diagnosed as suffering from panic attacks and both Mick and Linda struggle with Ollie's autism diagnosis.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Casting and introduction ===\n\n[[File:Danny Dyer at Upton Park, 02 Oct 2010.jpg|thumb|Danny Dyer was cast as Mick Carter in 2013.]]\n\nOn 1 October 2013, it was announced that Danny Dyer had been cast in the role of Mick Carter, the younger brother of [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), who joined ''EastEnders'' in 2006, and [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]),<ref name=\"Brown\"/> whose casting was announced 12 days earlier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a516615/eastenders-luisa-bradshaw-white-to-play-shirleys-sister-tina.html|title='EastEnders': Luisa Bradshaw-White to play Shirley's sister Tina|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=19 September 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> Dyer was asked to be in ''EastEnders'', and said that production staff \"told me how brilliant I was\" and \"I felt really honoured\",<ref name=\"Inside Soap 2013 48\" /> but he said he \"thought long and hard\" about accepting the role, doing so because it was \"at the right time in my career.\"<ref name=\"Digital Spy flawless\"/> He also said he accepted the role because it was not \"too obvious\" and would be a double act with Mick's wife [[Linda Carter]], saying, \"it was a big deciding factor when they [said] that my screen wife Linda was going to be played by [[Kellie Bright]].\"<ref name=\"Radio Times 7 December 2013\" /> He began filming later in October, along with Bright.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"EastEnders blog\" /> The character was to be the new landlord of the \"iconic\"<ref name=\"Daily Record 1 Oct 2013\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/cockney-hardman-actor-danny-dyer-2325997|title=Cockney hardman actor Danny Dyer set for role in EastEnders.. as big softie who takes over the Queen Vic|last=Methven|first=Nicola|date=1 October 2013|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref> [[The Queen Victoria|Queen Victoria]] public house (also known as The Vic), appearing from Christmas Day, 25 December 2013.<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-10-01/eastenders-danny-dyer-and-kellie-bright-to-become-new-queen-vic-landlord-and-landlady|title=EastEnders: Danny Dyer and Kellie Bright to become new Queen Vic landlord and landlady|last=Brown|first=David|date=1 October 2013|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Digital Spy flawless\">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a532728/eastenders-danny-dyer-mick-carter-entrance-is-flawless.html|title='EastEnders' Danny Dyer: 'Mick Carter entrance is flawless'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=20 November 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref> The Carters are the first new family to join the series and immediately take over the pub,<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10345595/Danny-Dyer-and-Kellie-Bright-to-join-EastEnders-and-run-the-Queen-Vic-pub.html|title=Danny Dyer and Kellie Bright to join EastEnders and run the Queen Vic pub|last=Ward|first=Rachel|date=1 October 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref> and it was said that the family would become \"a new ''EastEnders'' dynasty.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/342071/Time-gentlemen-please-Danny-Dyer-is-new-landlord-of-Eastenders-Queen-Vic-pub|title=Time, gentlemen please!

Dyer's casting was announced on 1 October 2013 with that of his on-screen partner/Wife, [[Linda Carter]], played by [[Kellie Bright]]. He is the son of established character [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and a member of the Carter family. Mick immediately becomes the new landlord of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], bringing Linda, their son [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny Carter]] ([[Sam Strike]]/[[Ted Reilly]]) and pet bulldog [[Lady Di (EastEnders)|Lady Di]] with him. They are later joined by daughter [[Nancy Carter]] ([[Maddy Hill]]), son [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny Hatchard|Danny-Boy Hatchard]]) and other members of the extended family.\n\nThe character was created by [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]], who came up with the idea of the Carter family before he became the executive producer of ''EastEnders''. The character was influenced by Treadwell-Collins' own father. Dyer was asked to play Mick and he accepted because the role was not typical of other roles he has played, and he was happy that Mick's partner would be played by Bright. Mick is described as a family man who is patriotic and kind, and it was said that he has a good partnership with Linda but they fight \"like teenagers\".\n\nMick's storylines have included overcoming his fear of water, taking the blame for soliciting after being arrested, the discovery that Shirley is not his sister but actually his mother, coping with Linda's rape by his brother [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]), the death of his grandfather [[Stan Carter]] ([[Timothy West]]) from terminal cancer, becoming a father to [[Ollie Carter]], blaming Nancy when Ollie is seriously injured during a fight between her and Lee, discovering that Lee instigated a robbery at The Queen Vic, ongoing financial issues and developing feelings for his daughter-in-law, [[Whitney Dean|Whitney Carter]] ([[Shona McGarty]]). Dyer took a short break from the show in early 2017.<!--Do not add Dyer's control renewal, it is featured in development--> Mick has also feuded with former friend [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]) and was framed by Stuart for his attempted murder \u2013 a storyline which helped to aid Dyer's short break in 2018. Dyer took another break from the show in 2019 and was absent for two months.\n\nDyer's casting received a mixed response, with Daniel Kilkelly from [[Digital Spy]] feeling positive about the new character but calling it a risk, as Dyer is so well known, Vicky Prior from the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' saying Dyer could be \"the saviour of the soap\", and Ally Ross from ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' opining that Dyer could do better because of the show's recent drop in ratings. Several critics, as well as Dyer himself, hoped that he would help increase the show's ratings, but the casting was criticised by domestic violence charities because of previous comments Dyer was alleged to have made. Dyer has won several awards for the role including the [[TV Choice Award]] for Best Soap Actor in 2014 and [[National Television Award]] for Outstanding Serial Drama Performance in 2015, 2016 and 2019.\n\n== Storylines ==\nMick is first mentioned when his sisters, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]), visit his partner [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) at Linda's mother, [[Elaine Peacock]]'s ([[Maria Friedman]]) pub in [[Watford]].

After Stan suffers a fall, Linda persuades Mick to check on Stan. Mick discovers there has been a break in and disturbs the thief, who punches him and flees. Mick suspects that it was his son [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]), who may have run away from serving in the army in Afghanistan. Mick visits Stan in the hospital and enquires about Lee, and Stan assures him that he has not seen Lee. Mick leaves the hospital angry after Stan asks to stay at The Queen Vic, but Tina is angry to find out that Stan is in hospital and Mick has not told her. Tina brings Stan to The Queen Vic to stay for three weeks. Mick reluctantly agrees and is further angered when Stan makes derogatory comments about both Tina and Johnny's homosexualities and about the dangers faced by Lee in the army. Stan also tells Mick about a time when his mother tried to drown him in the bath when he was an infant.\n\nMick and Stan's relationship starts to thaw, annoying Shirley. Mick attempts to reunite Shirley with her estranged son, [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]), with little success. Tina refers to the incident involving a young Mick in the bathtub, citing the event as happening after their mother left. This confuses Mick, and he concludes that it was Stan who tried to kill him and attacks him, prompting Shirley to admit that she had attempted to drown him. [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) finds out from Shirley that Mick is actually her son, his father is a man named Andy and her mother [[Sylvie Carter]] ([[Linda Marlowe]]) concealed the pregnancy and brought Mick up as her and Stan's son. Shirley warns Phil not to tell Mick. Despite not being able to swim and having a phobia of water, Mick signs up to a sponsored swim in aid of his friend [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]]'s ([[Perry Fenwick]]) young daughter, [[Janet Mitchell]] (Grace), who has [[Down's syndrome]]. He starts to learn at the local swimming pool, and confesses his fear to his friend, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]).

Linda becomes cold towards him and refuses to have sex; Mick deduces that she is pregnant. She denies this, but he discovers Linda is pregnant and is planning to have a secret abortion. After a discussion, they agree to keep the baby. Stan reveals he has terminal prostate cancer, leading Mick to enlist Dean's help in tracking down Shirley to try and convince her to return. They find her staying in a caravan with [[Buster Briggs]] ([[Karl Howman]]) and she soon returns. Mick and Shirley find that Shirley and Tina's mother, Sylvie, is staying with her sister [[Babe Smith]] ([[Annette Badland]]). Babe reveals that Sylvie has [[Alzheimer's disease]].\n\nMick plans to propose to Linda, but Linda reveals to Mick that Dean raped her. Dean claims that he and Linda had an affair, so Mick attacks Dean. To stop the attack, Shirley reveals that Dean and Mick are brothers and she is Mick's mother, and it emerges that Buster is Mick's father as well as Dean's. Linda claims that their relationship can survive as long as nobody else finds out that she was raped. She eavesdrops while Mick, Tina, Shirley, Babe and Stan argue, only to hear Mick deny that Dean is part of the family. Mick tells Stan and Tina that Dean raped Linda. When he realises Linda has left, a despairing and devastated Mick smashes up the bar. Mick and Linda later report the rape to the police. When Mick learns that Shirley was forced to keep the secret of being his mother out of fear that she would never see him again, he decides to give her another chance, as long as Dean keeps his distance from him. He is shocked to learn that Stan wants him and Tina to help him die and stops Tina from doing so. The next week, Dean is arrested and released on bail. He refuses to leave Walford on Shirley's insistence until Mick orders him to.\n\nDean returns and sneaks into the pub's cellar, intending to set fire to it, and taking Nancy hostage. Mick stops him and chokes him until he is unconscious, but Dean goes missing after this. Linda proposes to Mick and he accepts. Nancy believes Mick has killed Dean, until Dean returns. Linda gives birth prematurely to [[Ollie Carter]] after falling down the stairs. Dean believes the baby is his until Mick discovers he, Linda and Ollie share the same blood group, but Dean's is different, meaning Dean cannot be Ollie's father. Mick and Buster then start to bond. Mick and Linda bring Ollie home, where Mick ejects Dean after he attempts to shake Linda's hand. Mick and Shirley reunite when they scatter Stan's ashes. Dean starts a relationship with [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), so her sister [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) tries to get Mick to help her get rid of Dean, but he refuses to help. Mick lies to his family so he can take Ollie to see Shirley, but they soon find out and Linda is initially not happy. Dean attempts to rape Roxy when she ends the relationship; Shirley witnesses this and realises Dean did rape Linda, and she tries to drown him but is unsuccessful. At Mick and Linda's wedding, Dean arrives and tries to drown Shirley in a lake, but Mick rescues Shirley and then resuscitates Dean after he nearly drowns, wanting him to face punishment. Dean is arrested, and Mick and Linda get married.\n\nWhen they return from their honeymoon, they discover that Lee's girlfriend, [[Whitney Dean]]'s ([[Shona McGarty]]), brother [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) has stolen \u00a35,000 from the safe. Mick accompanies Whitney to meet Ryan and Mick convinces Ryan to return the money and hand himself to the police, because he is on the run from the police, to which Ryan agrees.

An undercover police officer becomes a regular customer, and eventually Mick, Babe and Shirley are arrested, charged and fined \u00a320,000 in court. Babe leaves Sylvie near the canal, in an attempt to let her drown; when Sylvie is found, it is revealed Babe is responsible and Mick evicts her after she starts insulting Linda. The next day, Mick is disgusted to learn that Lee had hit Whitney during a row and confides in Shirley who suggest that Lee and Whitney should be separated for Whitney's safety, which he regretfully tells Lee. Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a note saying he no longer loves her, but Mick persuades him to explain to her his reasons before going. With Babe missing, Mick no is no longer required to pay her share of the fine, however, realising that Mick cannot pay the fine as well as other debts, including bills for the repair of leaks in the pub, Shirley decides to put the blame for the licence break on herself. As the fine is unpaid, Shirley is jailed and subsequently charged with perverting the cause of justice, which increases her sentence from six weeks to three months. A few days later, Ian's wife, [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) calls Linda, worried about Mick. Linda returns the following day and Mick informs her of Lee's departure and the debts he has left. Linda initially blames Whitney and an argument ensues, causing Whitney to storm out. Mick explains to Linda that it was Lee's fault, causing another argument between the two although they later make up and have sex. After a heart-to-heart with Whitney, Linda decides to return to Elaine, which angers Mick as Linda saw the state he was in and left anyway. Soon after Linda's departure, Mick receives a phone call from Tamwar saying that Nancy has been critically injured after being hit by a car while backpacking in Bulgaria. He immediately leaves Walford and flies to Bulgaria to be with her.\n\nIn Mick's absence, Linda hires a new bar manager, [[Woody Woodward (EastEnders)|Woody Woodward]] ([[Lee Ryan]]) and agrees with Shirley to sell The Queen Vic's freehold in order to solve their financial problems. Mick returns and walks in on Whitney and Woody in bed after having sex. He then punches Woody and throws him out. He later learns that Shirley and Linda sold the freehold of The Queen Vic behind his back and forged his signature, and turns to alcohol to deal with the stress. He also learns that [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) set up the deal, and confronts him, branding him a snake and warning him to stay away from him. He then kisses a vulnerable Whitney who responds. Shirley learns of the kiss and tells Whitney to pack her bags and leave. When Mick learns that Shirley did this, he drunkenly throws a glass at her, but instantly regrets it and cries, saying he no longer knows himself. Mick tells Linda about the kiss on her return but is then left devastated when she tells him their relationship is over. Later, Linda agrees to give Mick another chance but when her admits he made a failed attempt to pay Whitney off with \u00a3200, Linda slaps him. Following a reconciliation and a holiday, Mick discovers Linda had cancer and did not tell him, so he leaves her. However, they get back together the following day. The freeholders of the pub, Grafton Hill, demand \u00a360,000 for structural repairs, saying they will be evicted if they do not pay. Business consultant [[Fi Browning]] ([[Lisa Faulkner]]) tells them she has reduced it to \u00a350,000, which they manage to raise. However, [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]) claims to own the pub, and Fi, his daughter, denies reducing the debt; the family are given a month to leave the pub. They tell James they will take the company to court, but James reveals that he knows Mick's signature was forged on the paperwork, so the Carters start looking for a new home. Mick turns down a pub in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] after meeting [[Aidan Maguire]] ([[Patrick Bergin]]), who is arranging a robbery and he manipulates Mick into joining his team, along with Phil, [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) and [[Keanu Taylor]] ([[Danny Walters (actor)|Danny Walters]]). Mick is shot in the arm by [[Callum \"Halfway\" Highway]] (Tony Clay) during the heist and is treated by [[Mariam Ahmed]] (Indira Joshi). Mick recovers, but the money they stole then goes missing. Halfway, who is an army friend of Lee's, moves into The Queen Vic, and the Carters are able to buy back the pub from Fi when Halfway gives them a ring he stole during the heist that is worth \u00a3200,000. This causes Aidan to suspect Mick of stealing the money, so he has a drug dealer start dealing from the Vic's toilets. When Mick tries to stop this, Aidan threatens to take The Queen Vic from them, as he has already taken The Albert bar from Vincent, and also threatens to hurt Johnny, who has moved away, and Nancy. Linda has the drug dealer arrested so Aidan threatens to have Mick killed. [[Mel Owen]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]) gives Mick the number of a hitman, and when Mick discovers Aidan has covered The Queen Vic hallway as well as Ollie in petrol, the Carters agree to contact him to get rid of Aidan, but Linda stops it. The Carters then prepare to leave for Watford but Mick returns to The Queen Vic at the last minute to confront Aidan. He stands up to Aidan but Aidan beats him with his cane. He's stopped when Jack, Billy, Linda, Shirley and Ted barge in and stop him. Aidan calls on his henchman and he threatens to set the pub on fire unless Mick makes an apology. He's forced to say sorry and Aidan leaves but gets punched by Phil and is warned off by Phil's knowledge that Aidan murdered [[Luke Browning]] (Adam Astill), giving back the Carters control of The Queen Vic.\n\nMick's childhood friend and Halfway's brother, [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]), arrives in Walford but Linda dislikes him. Mick tells Linda that Stuart went to a Young Offender Institute after covering for something Mick did when they were 13 and Linda has to accept their friendship. When [[Shakil Kazemi]] ([[Shaheen Jafargholi]]) is stabbed, Mick fails to realise he needs help so is devastated when he dies and blames himself. Mick sees pictures of and messages to schoolgirls on Stuart's phone and confronts Stuart, who says he has done nothing wrong, but Mick reports him to the police. Stuart explains that he poses as underage girls online to expose paedophiles and the police know about it. Stuart enlists Mick's help in confronting paedophiles, and Stuart reveals that he suffered sexual abuse from an officer when he was in the Young Offender Institute. Mick says Stuart should track the man down, but Stuart wants to protect girls from abuse now. Mick agrees to help but the confrontation goes wrong, but it emerges that the man is Stuart's friend and they were testing Mick. Mick is humiliated and Stuart says Mick cannot handle it and adds that he saved Mick from abuse by taking the blame for what Mick did when they were teenagers and calls Mick a coward. Mick and Stuart then have a physical fight. Stuart asks Halfway to help to confront someone but Mick urges Halfway not to go and joins them when he sees Halfway leaving. Stuart asks Halfway to confront the man, [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Fred Lewis|Fred Lewis]], but Mick tries to stop him and the commotion causes Fred to run. Mick and Halfway follow Fred on the tube and Mick concludes that Stuart has made a mistake and Fred is not a paedophile. He tells Stuart this, but Stuart posts the confrontation video regardless. After Fred is assaulted and hospitalised, Mick gives Stuart an alibi but the police explain that Fred was trying to track down his daughter online. Stuart and Mick fight again and Stuart insists he is right about Fred. Mick tells Stuart to post a retraction video, which Stuart does but he believes that Mick needs to be hurt in the same way Stuart was in the Young Offender Institute. Stuart shoots himself and frames Mick, who is arrested and remanded. Linda starts to believe that Mick shot Stuart, ejects Tina from The Queen Vic, allows Stuart to move in and calls a solicitor to initiate divorce proceedings. However, this is actually part of Linda's secret plan to help get Mick out of prison. Linda records Stuart admitting that Mick did not shoot him and he is released from prison. Mick takes Stuart to an abandoned factory where he vows to kill him. Mick is diagnosed as suffering from panic attacks and both Mick and Linda struggle with Ollie's autism diagnosis.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Casting and introduction ===\n\n[[File:Danny Dyer at Upton Park, 02 Oct 2010.jpg|thumb|Danny Dyer was cast as Mick Carter in 2013.]]\n\nOn 1 October 2013, it was announced that Danny Dyer had been cast in the role of Mick Carter, the younger brother of [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), who joined ''EastEnders'' in 2006, and [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]),<ref name=\"Brown\"/> whose casting was announced 12 days earlier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a516615/eastenders-luisa-bradshaw-white-to-play-shirleys-sister-tina.html|title='EastEnders': Luisa Bradshaw-White to play Shirley's sister Tina|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=19 September 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> Dyer was asked to be in ''EastEnders'', and said that production staff \"told me how brilliant I was\" and \"I felt really honoured\",<ref name=\"Inside Soap 2013 48\" /> but he said he \"thought long and hard\" about accepting the role, doing so because it was \"at the right time in my career.\"<ref name=\"Digital Spy flawless\"/> He also said he accepted the role because it was not \"too obvious\" and would be a double act with Mick's wife [[Linda Carter]], saying, \"it was a big deciding factor when they [said] that my screen wife Linda was going to be played by [[Kellie Bright]].\"<ref name=\"Radio Times 7 December 2013\" /> He began filming later in October, along with Bright.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"EastEnders blog\" /> The character was to be the new landlord of the \"iconic\"<ref name=\"Daily Record 1 Oct 2013\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/cockney-hardman-actor-danny-dyer-2325997|title=Cockney hardman actor Danny Dyer set for role in EastEnders.. as big softie who takes over the Queen Vic|last=Methven|first=Nicola|date=1 October 2013|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref> [[The Queen Victoria|Queen Victoria]] public house (also known as The Vic), appearing from Christmas Day, 25 December 2013.<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-10-01/eastenders-danny-dyer-and-kellie-bright-to-become-new-queen-vic-landlord-and-landlady|title=EastEnders: Danny Dyer and Kellie Bright to become new Queen Vic landlord and landlady|last=Brown|first=David|date=1 October 2013|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Digital Spy flawless\">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a532728/eastenders-danny-dyer-mick-carter-entrance-is-flawless.html|title='EastEnders' Danny Dyer: 'Mick Carter entrance is flawless'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=20 November 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref> The Carters are the first new family to join the series and immediately take over the pub,<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10345595/Danny-Dyer-and-Kellie-Bright-to-join-EastEnders-and-run-the-Queen-Vic-pub.html|title=Danny Dyer and Kellie Bright to join EastEnders and run the Queen Vic pub|last=Ward|first=Rachel|date=1 October 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref> and it was said that the family would become \"a new ''EastEnders'' dynasty.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/342071/Time-gentlemen-please-Danny-Dyer-is-new-landlord-of-Eastenders-Queen-Vic-pub|title=Time, gentlemen please!

Not all are equivalent, and for legal purposes the effective definitions vary depending on the jurisdiction and the purposes for which the term is being used. {{Efn|In other countries with privacy protection laws derived from the [[OECD]] privacy principles, the term used is more often \"personal information\", which may be somewhat broader: in Australia's ''Privacy Act ''1988 (Cth) \"personal information\" also includes information from which the person's identity is \"reasonably ascertainable\", potentially covering some information not covered by PII.}} Under European and other data protection regimes, which centre primarily around the [[General Data Protection Regulation]], the term \"personal data\" is significantly broader, and determines the scope of the regulatory regime.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Paul M|last2=Solove|first2=Daniel|date=2014|title=Reconciling Personal Information in the United States and European Union|journal=California Law Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=4|doi=10.15779/Z38Z814}}</ref>\n\n[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] Special Publication 800-122<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-122.pdf|title=NIST Special Publication 800-122|website=nist.gov}}{{NIST-PD}}</ref> defines personally identifiable information as \"any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.\" So, for example, a user's [[IP address]] is not classed as PII on its own, but is classified as a linked PII.<ref>Section 3.3.3 \"Identifiability\"</ref> However, in the [[European Union]], the IP address of an Internet subscriber may be classed as personal data.<ref name=\"ECJ-IP\">{{cite web |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/european-court-of-justice-rules-ip-addresses-are-personal-data-1.2835704 |title=European Court of Justice rules IP addresses are personal data|date=19 October 2016 |work=The Irish Times|accessdate=10 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\nPersonal data is defined under the GDPR as \"any information which [is] related to an identified or identifiable natural person\". \n\nThe concept of PII has become prevalent as [[information technology]] and the [[Internet]] have made it easier to collect PII leading to a profitable market in collecting and reselling PII. PII can also be exploited by criminals to [[stalking|stalk]] or [[identity theft|steal the identity]] of a person, or to aid in the planning of criminal acts. As a response to these threats, many website [[privacy policy|privacy policies]] specifically address the gathering of PII,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nokhbeh|first=Razieh|date=2017|title=A study of web privacy policies across industries.|journal=Journal of Information Privacy & Security|volume=13|pages=169\u2013185}}</ref> and lawmakers such as the [[European Parliament]] have enacted a series of legislation such as the [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR) to limit the distribution and accessibility of PII.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9565-2015-INIT/en/pdf|title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation)|date=11 June 2015|website=European Data Consilium|access-date=3 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nImportant confusion arises around whether PII means information which is identifiable (that is, can be associated with a person) or identifying (that is, associated uniquely with a person, such that the PII ''identifies'' them). In prescriptive data privacy regimes such as HIPAA, PII items have been specifically defined. In broader data protection regimes such as the GDPR, personal data is defined in a non-prescriptive principles-based way. Information that might not count as PII under HIPAA can be personal data for the purposes of GDPR. For this reason, \"PII\" is typically deprecated internationally. \n\n== Conceptions ==\nThe U.S. government used the term \"personally identifiable\" in 2007 in a memorandum from the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB),<ref name=\"whitehouse.gov\">[https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2007/m07-16.pdf M-07-16 SUBJECT:Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information] FROM: Clay Johnson III, Deputy Director for Management (2007/05/22)</ref> and that usage now appears in US standards such as the [[NIST]] ''Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information'' (SP 800-122).<ref name=\"NIST\" /> The OMB memorandum defines PII as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''Information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother\u2019s maiden name, etc.''}}\n\nA term similar to PII, \"personal data\" is defined in EU directive 95/46/EC, for the purposes of the directive:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:HTML |title=Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|''Article 2a: 'personal data' shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;''}}\n\nHowever, in the EU rules, there has been a clearer notion that the data subject can potentially be identified through additional processing of other attributes\u2014quasi- or pseudo-identifiers. In the GDPR Personal Data is defined as:\n\n''Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person<ref>{{cite web |title=What is personal data? |url=https://www.truevault.com/learn/what-is-personal-data |website=TrueVault}}</ref>''\n\nAnother term similar to PII, \"personal information\" is defined in a section of the California data breach notification law, SB1386:<ref name=\"California\">{{cite web\n| url= http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/01-02/bill/sen/sb_1351-1400/sb_1386_bill_20020926_chaptered.html\n| title=Text of California Senate Bill SB 1386 ref paragraph SEC. 2 1798.29.(e)\n| publisher=California\n}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|''(e) For purposes of this section, \"personal information\" means an individual's first name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements, when either the name or the data elements are not encrypted:  (1) Social security number. (2) Driver's license number or California Identification Card number. (3) Account number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account. (f) For purposes of this section, \"personal information\" does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.''}}\n\nThe concept of information combination given in the SB1386 definition is key to correctly distinguishing PII, as defined by OMB, from \"personal information\", as defined by SB1386.  Information, such as a name, that lacks context cannot be said to be SB1386 \"personal information\", but it must be said to be PII as defined by OMB. For example, the name [[Placeholder name|John Smith]] has no meaning in the current context and is therefore not SB1386 \"personal information\", but it is PII. A [[Social Security Number]] (SSN) without a name or some other associated identity or context information is not SB1386 \"personal information\", but it is PII. For example, the SSN 078-05-1120 by itself is PII, but it is not SB1386 \"personal information\". However the combination of a valid name with the correct SSN is SB1386 \"personal information\".<ref name=\"California\" />\n\nThe combination of a name with a context may also be considered PII; for example, if a person's name is on a list of patients for an HIV clinic.  However, it is not necessary for the name to be combined with a context in order for it to be PII.  The reason for this distinction is that bits of information such as names, although they may not be sufficient by themselves to make an identification, may later be combined with other information to identify persons and expose them to harm.\n\nAccording to the OMB, it is not always the case that PII is \"sensitive\", and context may be taken into account in deciding whether certain PII is or is not sensitive.<ref name=\"whitehouse.gov\" />{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Australia, the [[Privacy Act 1988]] deals with the protection of individual privacy, using the OECD Privacy Principles from the 1980s to set up a broad, principles-based regulatory model (unlike in the US, where coverage is generally not based on broad principles but on specific technologies, business practices or data items). Section 6 has the relevant definition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1988108/s6.html|title=Privacy Act 1988|accessdate=15 May 2019}}</ref> The critical detail is that the definition of 'personal information' also applies to where the individual can be indirectly identified:\n\n{{quote|\"personal information\" means information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable whether the information or opinion is true or not; and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.  [emphasis added]}}\n\nThis raises the question of reasonableness: assume it is theoretically possible to identify a person from information which does not include a name or address, but does contain clues which could be pursued to find out who it relates to. How much extra effort does it take to make it unreasonable that such information could be identified? For instance, if the information involves an IP address, and the relevant ISP stores logs which could easily be inspected (if you had sufficient legal justification) to re-link the IP address to the account holder, can their identity be \"reasonably ascertained\"? If such linking used to be expensive, slow and difficult, but becomes easier, does this change the answer at some point?\n\nIt appears that this definition is significantly broader than the Californian example given above, and thus that Australian privacy law, while in some respects weakly enforced, may cover a broader category of data and information than in some US law.\n\nIn particular, online [[behavioral advertising]] businesses based in the US but surreptitiously collecting information from people in other countries in the form of cookies, bugs, trackers and the like may find that their preference to avoid the implications of wanting to build a psychographic profile of a particular person using the rubric of 'we don't collect personal information' may find that this does not make sense under a broader definition like that in the Australian Privacy Act.\n\nNote that the term \"PII\" is not used in Australian privacy law. \n\n=== Canada ===\n* [[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]] governs the Federal Government agencies\n* [[Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Ontario)|Ontario Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act]] and similar Provincial legislation governs Provincial Government agencies\n* [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]] governs private corporations, unless there is equivalent Provincial legislation\n* [[Personal Health Information Protection Act|Ontario Personal Health Information Protection Act]] and other similar Provincial legislation governs health information\n\n=== European Union ===\nEuropean data protection law does not utilize the concept of personally identifiable information, and its scope is instead determined by non-synonymous, wider concept of \"personal data\".\n* Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights\n* The [[General Data Protection Regulation]] adopted in April 2016.

The U.S. Senate proposed the [[Privacy Act of 2005]], which attempted to strictly limit the display, purchase, or sale of PII without the person's consent. Similarly, the (proposed) [[Anti-Phishing Act of 2005]] attempted to prevent the acquiring of PII through [[phishing]].\n\nU.S. lawmakers have paid special attention to the [[social security number]] because it can be easily used to commit [[identity theft]]. The (proposed) [[Social Security Number Protection Act of 2005]] and (proposed) [[Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2005]] each sought to limit the distribution of an individual's social security number.\n\n=== NIST definition ===\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology is a physical sciences laboratory, and a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce.

Note that information can still be ''private'', in the sense that a person may not wish for it to become publicly known, without being personally identifiable. Moreover, sometimes multiple pieces of information, none sufficient by itself to uniquely identify an individual, may uniquely identify a person when combined; this is one reason that multiple pieces of evidence are usually presented at criminal trials. It has been shown that, in 1990, 87% of the population of the United States could be uniquely identified by gender, [[ZIP code]], and full date of birth.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://privacy.cs.cmu.edu/dataprivacy/HIPAA/HIPAAcomments.html\n| title=Comments of Latanya Sweeney, PhD on \"Standards of Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information\"\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328103238/http://privacy.cs.cmu.edu/dataprivacy/HIPAA/HIPAAcomments.html\n| archivedate=28 March 2009\n| url-status=dead\n| publisher=Carnegie Mellon University\n}}</ref>\n\nIn [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] and [[Internet slang]], the practice of finding and releasing such information is called \"[[doxing]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author=James Wray and Ulf Stabe |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/articles/The-FBIs-warning-about-doxing-was-too-little-too-late |title=The FBI's warning about doxing was too little too late |publisher=Thetechherald.com |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/276610/20120104/anonymous-operation-hiroshima-inside-doxing-coup.htm |title=Anonymous's Operation Hiroshima: Inside the Doxing Coup the Media Ignored (VIDEO) |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=1 January 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> It is sometimes used to deter collaboration with law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/07/did-lulzsec-trick-police-arresting-wrong-guy/40522/ |title=Did LulzSec Trick Police into Arresting the Wrong Guy? - Technology |publisher=The Atlantic Wire |date=28 July 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> On occasion, the doxing can trigger an arrest, particularly if law enforcement agencies suspect that the \"doxed\" individual may panic and disappear.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bright |first=Peter |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/03/doxed-how-sabu-was-outed-by-former-anons-long-before-his-arrest.ars |title=Doxed: how Sabu was outed by former Anons long before his arrest |publisher=Ars Technica |date=7 March 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== State laws and significant court rulings ====\n* California\n** The California state constitution declares privacy an inalienable right in Article 1, Section 1.\n** [[Online Privacy Protection Act|California Online Privacy Protection Act (OPPA) of 2003]]\n** [[SB 1386]] requires organizations to notify individuals when PII (in combination with one or more additional, specific data elements) is known or believed to be acquired by an unauthorized person.\n** In 2011, the California State Supreme Court ruled that a person's ZIP code is PII.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/Community/emergingissues/blogs/emergingissueslawblog/archive/2011/02/15/california-supreme-court-zip-code-personal-identification-information-bullivant-houser-bailey-song-beverly-credit-card-act.aspx\n| title=California Supreme Court Holds that Zip Code is Personal Identification Information \u2013 Bullivant Houser Bailey Business Matters eAlert\n| publisher=LexisNexis\n}}</ref>\n* Nevada\n** Nevada Revised Statutes 603A-Security of Personal Information\n* Massachusetts\n** [[201 CMR 17.00]]: Standards for The Protection of Personal Information of Residents of the Commonwealth<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.mass.gov/ocabr/docs/idtheft/201cmr1700reg.pdf\n| title=201 CMR 17.00: Standards for The Protection of Personal Information of Residents of the Commonwealth\n| publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts\n}}</ref>\n** In 2013, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that ZIP codes are PII.<ref>Tyler v.

Not all are equivalent, and for legal purposes the effective definitions vary depending on the jurisdiction and the purposes for which the term is being used. {{Efn|In other countries with privacy protection laws derived from the [[OECD]] privacy principles, the term used is more often \"personal information\", which may be somewhat broader: in Australia's ''Privacy Act ''1988 (Cth) \"personal information\" also includes information from which the person's identity is \"reasonably ascertainable\", potentially covering some information not covered by PII.}} Under European and other data protection regimes, which centre primarily around the [[General Data Protection Regulation]], the term \"personal data\" is significantly broader, and determines the scope of the regulatory regime.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Paul M|last2=Solove|first2=Daniel|date=2014|title=Reconciling Personal Information in the United States and European Union|journal=California Law Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=4|doi=10.15779/Z38Z814}}</ref>\n\n[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] Special Publication 800-122<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-122.pdf|title=NIST Special Publication 800-122|website=nist.gov}}{{NIST-PD}}</ref> defines personally identifiable information as \"any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.\" So, for example, a user's [[IP address]] is not classed as PII on its own, but is classified as a linked PII.<ref>Section 3.3.3 \"Identifiability\"</ref> However, in the [[European Union]], the IP address of an Internet subscriber may be classed as personal data.<ref name=\"ECJ-IP\">{{cite web |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/european-court-of-justice-rules-ip-addresses-are-personal-data-1.2835704 |title=European Court of Justice rules IP addresses are personal data|date=19 October 2016 |work=The Irish Times|accessdate=10 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\nPersonal data is defined under the GDPR as \"any information which [is] related to an identified or identifiable natural person\". \n\nThe concept of PII has become prevalent as [[information technology]] and the [[Internet]] have made it easier to collect PII leading to a profitable market in collecting and reselling PII. PII can also be exploited by criminals to [[stalking|stalk]] or [[identity theft|steal the identity]] of a person, or to aid in the planning of criminal acts. As a response to these threats, many website [[privacy policy|privacy policies]] specifically address the gathering of PII,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nokhbeh|first=Razieh|date=2017|title=A study of web privacy policies across industries.|journal=Journal of Information Privacy & Security|volume=13|pages=169\u2013185}}</ref> and lawmakers such as the [[European Parliament]] have enacted a series of legislation such as the [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR) to limit the distribution and accessibility of PII.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9565-2015-INIT/en/pdf|title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation)|date=11 June 2015|website=European Data Consilium|access-date=3 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nImportant confusion arises around whether PII means information which is identifiable (that is, can be associated with a person) or identifying (that is, associated uniquely with a person, such that the PII ''identifies'' them). In prescriptive data privacy regimes such as HIPAA, PII items have been specifically defined. In broader data protection regimes such as the GDPR, personal data is defined in a non-prescriptive principles-based way. Information that might not count as PII under HIPAA can be personal data for the purposes of GDPR. For this reason, \"PII\" is typically deprecated internationally. \n\n== Conceptions ==\nThe U.S. government used the term \"personally identifiable\" in 2007 in a memorandum from the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB),<ref name=\"whitehouse.gov\">[https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2007/m07-16.pdf M-07-16 SUBJECT:Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information] FROM: Clay Johnson III, Deputy Director for Management (2007/05/22)</ref> and that usage now appears in US standards such as the [[NIST]] ''Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information'' (SP 800-122).<ref name=\"NIST\" /> The OMB memorandum defines PII as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''Information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother\u2019s maiden name, etc.''}}\n\nA term similar to PII, \"personal data\" is defined in EU directive 95/46/EC, for the purposes of the directive:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:HTML |title=Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|''Article 2a: 'personal data' shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;''}}\n\nHowever, in the EU rules, there has been a clearer notion that the data subject can potentially be identified through additional processing of other attributes\u2014quasi- or pseudo-identifiers. In the GDPR Personal Data is defined as:\n\n''Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person<ref>{{cite web |title=What is personal data? |url=https://www.truevault.com/learn/what-is-personal-data |website=TrueVault}}</ref>''\n\nAnother term similar to PII, \"personal information\" is defined in a section of the California data breach notification law, SB1386:<ref name=\"California\">{{cite web\n| url= http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/01-02/bill/sen/sb_1351-1400/sb_1386_bill_20020926_chaptered.html\n| title=Text of California Senate Bill SB 1386 ref paragraph SEC. 2 1798.29.(e)\n| publisher=California\n}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|''(e) For purposes of this section, \"personal information\" means an individual's first name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements, when either the name or the data elements are not encrypted:  (1) Social security number. (2) Driver's license number or California Identification Card number. (3) Account number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account. (f) For purposes of this section, \"personal information\" does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.''}}\n\nThe concept of information combination given in the SB1386 definition is key to correctly distinguishing PII, as defined by OMB, from \"personal information\", as defined by SB1386.  Information, such as a name, that lacks context cannot be said to be SB1386 \"personal information\", but it must be said to be PII as defined by OMB. For example, the name [[Placeholder name|John Smith]] has no meaning in the current context and is therefore not SB1386 \"personal information\", but it is PII. A [[Social Security Number]] (SSN) without a name or some other associated identity or context information is not SB1386 \"personal information\", but it is PII. For example, the SSN 078-05-1120 by itself is PII, but it is not SB1386 \"personal information\". However the combination of a valid name with the correct SSN is SB1386 \"personal information\".<ref name=\"California\" />\n\nThe combination of a name with a context may also be considered PII; for example, if a person's name is on a list of patients for an HIV clinic.  However, it is not necessary for the name to be combined with a context in order for it to be PII.  The reason for this distinction is that bits of information such as names, although they may not be sufficient by themselves to make an identification, may later be combined with other information to identify persons and expose them to harm.\n\nAccording to the OMB, it is not always the case that PII is \"sensitive\", and context may be taken into account in deciding whether certain PII is or is not sensitive.<ref name=\"whitehouse.gov\" />{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Australia, the [[Privacy Act 1988]] deals with the protection of individual privacy, using the OECD Privacy Principles from the 1980s to set up a broad, principles-based regulatory model (unlike in the US, where coverage is generally not based on broad principles but on specific technologies, business practices or data items). Section 6 has the relevant definition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1988108/s6.html|title=Privacy Act 1988|accessdate=15 May 2019}}</ref> The critical detail is that the definition of 'personal information' also applies to where the individual can be indirectly identified:\n\n{{quote|\"personal information\" means information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable whether the information or opinion is true or not; and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.  [emphasis added]}}\n\nThis raises the question of reasonableness: assume it is theoretically possible to identify a person from information which does not include a name or address, but does contain clues which could be pursued to find out who it relates to. How much extra effort does it take to make it unreasonable that such information could be identified? For instance, if the information involves an IP address, and the relevant ISP stores logs which could easily be inspected (if you had sufficient legal justification) to re-link the IP address to the account holder, can their identity be \"reasonably ascertained\"? If such linking used to be expensive, slow and difficult, but becomes easier, does this change the answer at some point?\n\nIt appears that this definition is significantly broader than the Californian example given above, and thus that Australian privacy law, while in some respects weakly enforced, may cover a broader category of data and information than in some US law.\n\nIn particular, online [[behavioral advertising]] businesses based in the US but surreptitiously collecting information from people in other countries in the form of cookies, bugs, trackers and the like may find that their preference to avoid the implications of wanting to build a psychographic profile of a particular person using the rubric of 'we don't collect personal information' may find that this does not make sense under a broader definition like that in the Australian Privacy Act.\n\nNote that the term \"PII\" is not used in Australian privacy law. \n\n=== Canada ===\n* [[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]] governs the Federal Government agencies\n* [[Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Ontario)|Ontario Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act]] and similar Provincial legislation governs Provincial Government agencies\n* [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]] governs private corporations, unless there is equivalent Provincial legislation\n* [[Personal Health Information Protection Act|Ontario Personal Health Information Protection Act]] and other similar Provincial legislation governs health information\n\n=== European Union ===\nEuropean data protection law does not utilize the concept of personally identifiable information, and its scope is instead determined by non-synonymous, wider concept of \"personal data\".\n* Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights\n* The [[General Data Protection Regulation]] adopted in April 2016.

The U.S. Senate proposed the [[Privacy Act of 2005]], which attempted to strictly limit the display, purchase, or sale of PII without the person's consent. Similarly, the (proposed) [[Anti-Phishing Act of 2005]] attempted to prevent the acquiring of PII through [[phishing]].\n\nU.S. lawmakers have paid special attention to the [[social security number]] because it can be easily used to commit [[identity theft]]. The (proposed) [[Social Security Number Protection Act of 2005]] and (proposed) [[Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2005]] each sought to limit the distribution of an individual's social security number.\n\n=== NIST definition ===\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology is a physical sciences laboratory, and a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce.

Note that information can still be ''private'', in the sense that a person may not wish for it to become publicly known, without being personally identifiable. Moreover, sometimes multiple pieces of information, none sufficient by itself to uniquely identify an individual, may uniquely identify a person when combined; this is one reason that multiple pieces of evidence are usually presented at criminal trials. It has been shown that, in 1990, 87% of the population of the United States could be uniquely identified by gender, [[ZIP code]], and full date of birth.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://privacy.cs.cmu.edu/dataprivacy/HIPAA/HIPAAcomments.html\n| title=Comments of Latanya Sweeney, PhD on \"Standards of Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information\"\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328103238/http://privacy.cs.cmu.edu/dataprivacy/HIPAA/HIPAAcomments.html\n| archivedate=28 March 2009\n| url-status=dead\n| publisher=Carnegie Mellon University\n}}</ref>\n\nIn [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] and [[Internet slang]], the practice of finding and releasing such information is called \"[[doxing]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author=James Wray and Ulf Stabe |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/articles/The-FBIs-warning-about-doxing-was-too-little-too-late |title=The FBI's warning about doxing was too little too late |publisher=Thetechherald.com |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/276610/20120104/anonymous-operation-hiroshima-inside-doxing-coup.htm |title=Anonymous's Operation Hiroshima: Inside the Doxing Coup the Media Ignored (VIDEO) |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=1 January 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> It is sometimes used to deter collaboration with law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/07/did-lulzsec-trick-police-arresting-wrong-guy/40522/ |title=Did LulzSec Trick Police into Arresting the Wrong Guy? - Technology |publisher=The Atlantic Wire |date=28 July 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> On occasion, the doxing can trigger an arrest, particularly if law enforcement agencies suspect that the \"doxed\" individual may panic and disappear.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bright |first=Peter |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/03/doxed-how-sabu-was-outed-by-former-anons-long-before-his-arrest.ars |title=Doxed: how Sabu was outed by former Anons long before his arrest |publisher=Ars Technica |date=7 March 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== State laws and significant court rulings ====\n* California\n** The California state constitution declares privacy an inalienable right in Article 1, Section 1.\n** [[Online Privacy Protection Act|California Online Privacy Protection Act (OPPA) of 2003]]\n** [[SB 1386]] requires organizations to notify individuals when PII (in combination with one or more additional, specific data elements) is known or believed to be acquired by an unauthorized person.\n** In 2011, the California State Supreme Court ruled that a person's ZIP code is PII.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/Community/emergingissues/blogs/emergingissueslawblog/archive/2011/02/15/california-supreme-court-zip-code-personal-identification-information-bullivant-houser-bailey-song-beverly-credit-card-act.aspx\n| title=California Supreme Court Holds that Zip Code is Personal Identification Information \u2013 Bullivant Houser Bailey Business Matters eAlert\n| publisher=LexisNexis\n}}</ref>\n* Nevada\n** Nevada Revised Statutes 603A-Security of Personal Information\n* Massachusetts\n** [[201 CMR 17.00]]: Standards for The Protection of Personal Information of Residents of the Commonwealth<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.mass.gov/ocabr/docs/idtheft/201cmr1700reg.pdf\n| title=201 CMR 17.00: Standards for The Protection of Personal Information of Residents of the Commonwealth\n| publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts\n}}</ref>\n** In 2013, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that ZIP codes are PII.<ref>Tyler v.

The value of data can change over time and in different contexts. Disclosing data can reverse [[information asymmetry]], though the costs of doing so can be unclear. In relation to companies, consumers often have \"imperfect information regarding when their data is collected, with what purposes, and with what consequences.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-Economics-of-Privacy.pdf  |title=The Economics of Privacy |first=Alessandro |last=Acquisti |author2=Curtis Taylor |author3=Liad Wagman |year=2015 }}</ref>\n\nWriting in 2015, Alessandro Acquisti, Curtis Taylor and Liad Wagman identified three \"waves\" in the trade of personal data:\n#In the 1970s, the [[Chicago Boys]] school claimed that protection of privacy could have a negative impact on the market because it could lead to incorrect and non-optimal decisions.
