Pocock was interested in kites from an early age, and experimented with pulling loads using kite power, gradually progressing from small stones to planks and large loads. He taught at a school in Prospect Place, [[Bristol]] and continued his experiments with his pupils. By 1820 he had determined that in combination they could support considerable weight and began experimenting with [[man-lifting kite]]s. In 1824, he used a 30-foot (9&nbsp;m) kite with a chair rig to lift his daughter, Martha (the future mother of [[cricket]]er [[W.G. Grace]]) over 270&nbsp;feet (82&nbsp;m) into the air. Later the same year and continuing to use his family as subjects, he lifted his son to the top of a cliff outside Bristol; his son briefly dismounted from the chair at the top of the 200-foot (60&nbsp;m) cliff and then concluded the test by releasing a clip on the kite line which allowed him to slide down the line in the chair and return to earth.\n\nHaving concluded that kites were capable of lifting humans, he turned again to experimenting with them as a way of pulling loads, this time as a method of pulling vehicles. Using kites in various arrangements he determined that a small number of large kites were capable of pulling a carriage with passengers.\n[[Image:Charvolants2.jpg|thumb|left|''Charvolants travelling in various directions with the same Wind'' (1827), a romanticised view of mass transportation by Charvolant.]]\nIn 1826, he patented the design of his \"Charvolant\" buggy. This used two kites on single line 1,500 to 1,800&nbsp;feet (457&ndash;459&nbsp;m) long to provide enough power to draw along a buggy carrying several passengers at considerable speed, similar to the modern sport of [[kite buggying]]. In his book, ''The Aeropleustic Art or Navigation in the Air by the use of Kites, or Buoyant Sails'', Pocock records that it performed at the rate of 20 miles an hour (32&nbsp;km/h) over considerable distances and that a mile could frequently be covered even over heavy roads in 2\u00be minutes. A group of three Charvolants made a trip of 113&nbsp;miles (182&nbsp;km) together, and on a run between Bristol and [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] one of the buggies sailed past the [[mail coach]], which at the time was the fastest passenger transport. On another trip, a Charvolant passed the coach of the [[Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Duke of Gloucester]], a breach of etiquette that was considered so rude that the occupants had to stop to let the Duke pass them.\n\nFour control lines to the kite provided a method of steering; these lines were paid out or drawn in from large spools mounted on the front of the carriage. Large wheels allowed the carriage to utilise the power from the kites effectively. In addition to controlling the kites, the driver had to steer the carriage by means of a T-bar which controlled the direction of the front wheels, and was responsible for the brake, an iron bar mounted on the carriage which dug into the road when the lever was pulled. Controlling the Charvolant was difficult, and this may have been why it never became successful commercially, even though it escaped the [[Toll road|toll]]s levied on the roads for horse-drawn carriages: tolls were applied according to the number of horses and since the Charvolant had none it incurred no charge.\n\nPocock advocated other uses for kites in his book, including auxiliary sail power for ships (similar to modern [[traction kite]]s), a means of dropping anchor and effecting rescues from [[shipwreck]]s. He also used his book to  advertise other of his inventions, including a celestial globe for viewing the stars that a teacher and pupils could stand inside.\n\nHe died of bronchitis at his home in Bristol on 9 November 1843.<ref name=tm />\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web|url=http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/mar2001.html|title=Special Collections: Book of the Month: The Aeropleustic Art or Navigation in the Air by the use of Kites, or Buoyant Sails|author=|publisher=University of Glasgow|date=March 2001|accessdate=23 January 2007}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.kitelife.com/archives/SEPT98/kite.htm|title=Kite History 101|author=Bob White|publisher=|date=|accessdate=23 January 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061031190814/http://www.kitelife.com/archives/SEPT98/kite.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 31 October 2006}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmag.com/master.html?http://www.nhmag.com/editors_pick/1957_04_pick.html|title=Go Fly a Kite|author=Joseph J.

{"title_page": "Roman festivals", "text_new": "{{About|ancient Roman holidays|the symphonic poem by Ottorino Respighi|Roman Festivals (Respighi)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}    \n{{Ancient Roman religion}}\n'''Festivals in ancient Rome''' were a very important part of [[religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious life]] during both the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial eras]], and one of the primary features of the [[Roman calendar]]. '''''Feriae''''' (\"holidays\" in the sense of \"holy days\"; singular also ''feriae'' or '''''dies ferialis''''') were either public ''(publicae)'' or private ''([[privatus|privatae]])''. State holidays were celebrated by the Roman people and received public funding. Games ''([[ludi]])'', such as the [[Ludi Apollinares]], were not technically ''feriae'', but the days on which they were celebrated were ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#festus|dies festi]]'', holidays in the modern sense of days off work. Although ''feriae'' were paid for by the state, ''ludi'' were often funded by wealthy individuals. ''Feriae privatae'' were holidays celebrated in honor of private individuals or by families.<ref>[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), pp. 38\u201339.</ref> This article deals only with public holidays, including rites celebrated by the state priests of Rome at temples, as well as celebrations by neighborhoods, families, and friends held simultaneously throughout Rome.\n\n''Feriae publicae'' were of three kinds:\n* ''Stativae'' were annual holidays that held a fixed or stable date on the calendar.\n* ''Conceptivae'' were annual holidays that were [[moveable feast]]s (like [[Easter]] on the Christian calendar, or [[Thanksgiving]] in [[North America]]); the date was announced by the [[Roman Magistrates|magistrates]] or [[College of Pontiffs|priests]] who were responsible for them.\n* ''[[#Feriae imperativae|Imperativae]]'' were holidays held \"on demand\" (from the verb ''impero, imperare'', \"to order, command\") when special celebrations or expiations were called for.<ref>Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic,'' p. 39.</ref>\n\nOne of the most important sources for Roman holidays is [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', an incomplete poem that describes and provides origins for festivals from January to June at the time of [[Augustus]].\n\n==Keeping the ''feriae''==\n\n[[Varro]] defined ''feriae'' as \"days instituted for the sake of the gods.\"<ref>Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 6.12 ''(dies deorum causa instituti'', as cited by Scullard, p. 39, noting also the phrase ''dis dedicati'', \"dedicated to the gods,\" in [[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.16.2.</ref> Religious rites were performed on the ''feriae'', and public business was suspended. Even [[slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] were supposed to be given some form of rest. [[Cicero]] says specifically that people who were free should not engage in lawsuits and quarrels, and slaves should get a break from their labors.<ref>Cicero, ''De legibus'' 2.29, as cited by Scullard, p. 39.</ref> [[Roman agriculture|Agricultural writers]] recognized that some jobs on a farm might still need to be performed, and specified what these were. Some agricultural tasks not otherwise permitted could be carried out if an expiation were made in advance ''([[piaculum]])'', usually the sacrifice of a puppy.<ref>[[Cato the Elder]], ''De agricultura'' 138; [[Columella]] 2.21.2; Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic,'' p. 39.</ref> Within the city of Rome, the [[flamen]]s and the priest known as the ''[[Rex sacrorum]]'' were not allowed even to see work done.\n\nOn a practical level, those who \"inadvertently\" worked could pay a fine or offer up a ''piaculum'', usually a pig. Work considered vital either to the gods or preserving human life was excusable, according to some experts on religious law. Although Romans were required not to work, they were not required to take any religious action unless they were priests or had family rites ''([[Sacra gentilicia|sacra gentilicia]])'' to maintain.<ref>Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic,'' pp. 39\u201340.</ref>\n\n==List of festivals by month==\nFollowing is a month-by-month list of Roman festivals and games that had a fixed place on the calendar. For some, the date on which they were first established is recorded. A deity's festival often marked the anniversary (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|dies natalis]],'' \"birthday\") of the founding of a temple, or a rededication after a major renovation. Festivals not named for deities are thought to be mong the oldest on the calendar.<ref>[[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], \"Initia Cereris,\" in ''Studies in Roman \nSome religious observances were monthly. The first day of the month was the [[Kalends]] (or Calends, from which the English word \"calendar\" derives). Each Kalends was sacred to [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], and the ''[[Regina sacrorum]]'' (\"Queen of the Rites,\" a public priestess) marked the day by presiding over a sacrifice to the goddess. Originally a pontiff and the ''[[Rex sacrorum]]'' reported the sighting of the [[new moon]], and the pontiff announced whether the [[Nones (calendar)|Nones]] occurred on the 5th or 7th of that month. On the Nones, announcements were made regarding events to take place that month; with the exception of the [[Poplifugia]], no major festivals were held before the Nones, though other ceremonies, such as anniversaries of temple dedications, might be carried out. The [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]] (usually the 13th, or in a few months the 15th) were sacred to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. On each Ides, a white lamb was led along the [[Via Sacra]] to the [[Capitolium]] for sacrifice to Jupiter.\n\nThe list also includes other notable public religious events such as sacrifices and processions that were observed annually but are neither ''feriae'' nor ''dies natales.'' Unless otherwise noted, the calendar is that of [[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic''.\n\n===[[Ianuarius]]===\n*1 (Kalends): From 153 BC onward, [[Roman consul|consuls]] entered office on this date, accompanied by ''[[Vota pro salute rei publicae|vota publica]]'' (public vows for the wellbeing of the republic and later of the emperor) and the taking of [[auspices]].

in the later Empire, they were regularly held January 3\u20135, but Macrobius (5th century AD) still categorized them as ''conceptivae''.<ref>Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'', p. 58.</ref>\n*  [[Sementivae]], a festival of sowing honoring Tellus and Ceres, placed on January 24\u201326 by Ovid, who regards these ''feriae'' as the same as Paganalia;

the date was announced by the ''[[curio maximus]]'' and set for each ''curia'' individually, with a general Fornacalia on February 17 for those who had missed their own or who were uncertain to which ''curia'' they belonged.\n* [[Amburbium]], a ceremony to purify the city ''(urbs)'' as a whole, perhaps held sometime in February.\n* [[Feriae Latinae]] (Latin Festival), a major and very old ''conceptivae'' in April.\n* [[Ambarvalia]], purification of the fields in May.\nThe [[Rosalia (festival)|Rosalia]] or \"Festival of Roses\" also had no fixed date, but was technically not one of the ''feriae conceptivae'' with a date announced by public priests based on archaic practice.\n\n==''Feriae imperativae''==\nFestivals were also held in ancient Rome in response to particular events, or for a particular purpose such as to propitiate or show gratitude toward the gods.  For example, [[Livy]] reports that following the Roman destruction of [[Alba Longa]] in the 7th century BC, and the removal of the Alban populace to Rome, it was reported to have rained stones on the [[Alban Hills|Mons Albanus]].  A Roman deputation was sent to investigate the report, and a further shower of stones was witnessed.  The Romans took this to be a sign of the displeasure of the Alban gods, the worship of whom had been abandoned with the evacuation of Alba  Longa.  Livy goes on to say that the Romans instituted a public festival of nine days, at the instigation either of a 'heavenly voice' heard on the Mons Albanus, or of the [[haruspex|haruspices]].  Livy also says that it became the longstanding practice in Rome that whenever a shower of stones was reported, a festival of nine days would be ordered in response.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:31</ref>\n\nAnother irregular festival of note is the [[Secular Games]]. Over the course of several days there were sacrifices, entertainers, and games hosted by the state, attempting to be the greatest display anyone living had ever seen. These games were intended to be held every 100 years with the purpose of it occurring only once in any individuals lifetime. At one point two cycles of the Secular Games were being held simultaneously, leading there to be people who would in fact witness it twice in their life.\n\n==''Mercatus''==\n{{redirect|Mercatus|the think tank|Mercatus Center}}\nThe noun ''mercatus'' (plural ''mercat\u016bs'') means \"commerce\" or \"the market\" generally, but it also refers to fairs or markets held immediately after certain ''ludi''. [[Cicero]] said<ref>[[Cicero]], ''Republic'' 2.27.</ref> that [[Numa Pompilius]], the semi-legendary second [[king of Rome]], established ''mercatus'' in conjunction with religious festivals to facilitate trade, since people had already gathered in great numbers. In early times, these ''mercatus'' may have played a role in wholesale trade, but as commerce in Rome became more sophisticated, by the late Republic they seem to have become retail fairs specialized for the holiday market. The [[Sigillaria (ancient Rome)|Sigillaria]] attached to the [[Saturnalia]] may have been a ''mercatus'' in this sense. Surviving ''[[fasti]]''<ref>''[[Fasti Antiates|Fasti Antiates Ministrorum]]'', ''[[Fasti Fratrum Arvalium]]'', and the \"so-called\" ''[[Fasti Maffeani]]'' = ''Inscriptiones Italiae'' XIII.2.377.</ref> record Mercatus Apollinares, July 14\u201319; Mercatus Romani, September 20\u201323; and Mercatus Plebeii, November 18\u201320.

'''''Feriae''''' (\"holidays\" in the sense of \"holy days\"; singular also ''feriae'' or '''''dies ferialis''''') were either public ''(publicae)'' or private ''([[privatus|privatae]])''. State holidays were celebrated by the Roman people and received public funding. Games ''([[ludi]])'', such as the [[Ludi Apollinares]], were not technically ''feriae'', but the days on which they were celebrated were ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#festus|dies festi]]'', holidays in the modern sense of days off work. Although ''feriae'' were paid for by the state, ''ludi'' were often funded by wealthy individuals. ''Feriae privatae'' were holidays celebrated in honor of private individuals or by families.<ref>[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), pp. 38\u201339.</ref> This article deals only with public holidays, including rites celebrated by the state priests of Rome at temples, as well as celebrations by neighborhoods, families, and friends held simultaneously throughout Rome.\n\n''Feriae publicae'' were of three kinds:\n* ''Stativae'' were annual holidays that held a fixed or stable date on the calendar.\n* ''Conceptivae'' were annual holidays that were [[moveable feast]]s (like [[Easter]] on the Christian calendar, or [[Thanksgiving]] in [[North America]]); the date was announced by the [[Roman Magistrates|magistrates]] or [[College of Pontiffs|priests]] who were responsible for them.\n* ''[[#Feriae imperativae|Imperativae]]'' were holidays held \"on demand\" (from the verb ''impero, imperare'', \"to order, command\") when special celebrations or expiations were called for.<ref>Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic,'' p. 39.</ref>\n\nOne of the most important sources for Roman holidays is [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', an incomplete poem that describes and provides origins for festivals from January to June at the time of [[Augustus]].\n\n==Keeping the ''feriae''==\n\n[[Varro]] defined ''feriae'' as \"days instituted for the sake of the gods.\"<ref>Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 6.12 ''(dies deorum causa instituti'', as cited by Scullard, p. 39, noting also the phrase ''dis dedicati'', \"dedicated to the gods,\" in [[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.16.2.</ref> Religious rites were performed on the ''feriae'', and public business was suspended. Even [[slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] were supposed to be given some form of rest. [[Cicero]] says specifically that people who were free should not engage in lawsuits and quarrels, and slaves should get a break from their labors.<ref>Cicero, ''De legibus'' 2.29, as cited by Scullard, p. 39.</ref> [[Roman agriculture|Agricultural writers]] recognized that some jobs on a farm might still need to be performed, and specified what these were. Some agricultural tasks not otherwise permitted could be carried out if an expiation were made in advance ''([[piaculum]])'', usually the sacrifice of a puppy.<ref>[[Cato the Elder]], ''De agricultura'' 138; [[Columella]] 2.21.2; Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic,'' p. 39.</ref> Within the city of Rome, the [[flamen]]s and the priest known as the ''[[Rex sacrorum]]'' were not allowed even to see work done.\n\nOn a practical level, those who \"inadvertently\" worked could pay a fine or offer up a ''piaculum'', usually a pig. Work considered vital either to the gods or preserving human life was excusable, according to some experts on religious law. Although Romans were required not to work, they were not required to take any religious action unless they were priests or had family rites ''([[Sacra gentilicia|sacra gentilicia]])'' to maintain.<ref>Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic,'' pp. 39\u201340.</ref>\n\n==List of festivals by month==\nFollowing is a month-by-month list of Roman festivals and games that had a fixed place on the calendar. For some, the date on which they were first established is recorded. A deity's festival often marked the anniversary (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|dies natalis]],'' \"birthday\") of the founding of a temple, or a rededication after a major renovation. Festivals not named for deities are thought to be among the oldest on the calendar.<ref>[[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], \"Initia Cereris,\" in ''Studies in Roman Literature, Culture and Religion'' (Brill, 1956), pp. 163\u2013164.</ref>\n\nSome religious observances were monthly. The first day of the month was the [[Kalends]] (or Calends, from which the English word \"calendar\" derives). Each Kalends was sacred to [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], and the ''[[Regina sacrorum]]'' (\"Queen of the Rites,\" a public priestess) marked the day by presiding over a sacrifice to the goddess. Originally a pontiff and the ''[[Rex sacrorum]]'' reported the sighting of the [[new moon]], and the pontiff announced whether the [[Nones (calendar)|Nones]] occurred on the 5th or 7th of that month. On the Nones, announcements were made regarding events to take place that month; with the exception of the [[Poplifugia]], no major festivals were held before the Nones, though other ceremonies, such as anniversaries of temple dedications, might be carried out. The [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]] (usually the 13th, or in a few months the 15th) were sacred to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. On each Ides, a white lamb was led along the [[Via Sacra]] to the [[Capitolium]] for sacrifice to Jupiter.\n\nThe list also includes other notable public religious events such as sacrifices and processions that were observed annually but are neither ''feriae'' nor ''dies natales.'' Unless otherwise noted, the calendar is that of [[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic''.\n\n===[[Ianuarius]]===\n*1 (Kalends): From 153 BC onward, [[Roman consul|consuls]] entered office on this date, accompanied by ''[[Vota pro salute rei publicae|vota publica]]'' (public vows for the wellbeing of the republic and later of the emperor) and the taking of [[auspices]].

in the later Empire, they were regularly held January 3\u20135, but Macrobius (5th century AD) still categorized them as ''conceptivae''.<ref>Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'', p. 58.</ref>\n*  [[Sementivae]], a festival of sowing honoring Tellus and Ceres, placed on January 24\u201326 by Ovid, who regards these ''feriae'' as the same as Paganalia;

the date was announced by the ''[[curio maximus]]'' and set for each ''curia'' individually, with a general Fornacalia on February 17 for those who had missed their own or who were uncertain to which ''curia'' they belonged.\n* [[Amburbium]], a ceremony to purify the city ''(urbs)'' as a whole, perhaps held sometime in February.\n* [[Feriae Latinae]] (Latin Festival), a major and very old ''conceptivae'' in April.\n* [[Ambarvalia]], purification of the fields in May.\nThe [[Rosalia (festival)|Rosalia]] or \"Festival of Roses\" also had no fixed date, but was technically not one of the ''feriae conceptivae'' with a date announced by public priests based on archaic practice.\n\n==''Feriae imperativae''==\nFestivals were also held in ancient Rome in response to particular events, or for a particular purpose such as to propitiate or show gratitude toward the gods.  For example, [[Livy]] reports that following the Roman destruction of [[Alba Longa]] in the 7th century BC, and the removal of the Alban populace to Rome, it was reported to have rained stones on the [[Alban Hills|Mons Albanus]].  A Roman deputation was sent to investigate the report, and a further shower of stones was witnessed.  The Romans took this to be a sign of the displeasure of the Alban gods, the worship of whom had been abandoned with the evacuation of Alba  Longa.  Livy goes on to say that the Romans instituted a public festival of nine days, at the instigation either of a 'heavenly voice' heard on the Mons Albanus, or of the [[haruspex|haruspices]].  Livy also says that it became the longstanding practice in Rome that whenever a shower of stones was reported, a festival of nine days would be ordered in response.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:31</ref>\n\nAnother irregular festival of note is the [[Secular Games]]. Over the course of several days there were sacrifices, entertainers, and games hosted by the state, attempting to be the greatest display anyone living had ever seen. These games were intended to be held every 100 years with the purpose of it occurring only once in any individuals lifetime. At one point two cycles of the Secular Games were being held simultaneously, leading there to be people who would in fact witness it twice in their life.\n\n==''Mercatus''==\n{{redirect|Mercatus|the think tank|Mercatus Center}}\nThe noun ''mercatus'' (plural ''mercat\u016bs'') means \"commerce\" or \"the market\" generally, but it also refers to fairs or markets held immediately after certain ''ludi''. [[Cicero]] said<ref>[[Cicero]], ''Republic'' 2.27.</ref> that [[Numa Pompilius]], the semi-legendary second [[king of Rome]], established ''mercatus'' in conjunction with religious festivals to facilitate trade, since people had already gathered in great numbers. In early times, these ''mercatus'' may have played a role in wholesale trade, but as commerce in Rome became more sophisticated, by the late Republic they seem to have become retail fairs specialized for the holiday market. The [[Sigillaria (ancient Rome)|Sigillaria]] attached to the [[Saturnalia]] may have been a ''mercatus'' in this sense. Surviving ''[[fasti]]''<ref>''[[Fasti Antiates|Fasti Antiates Ministrorum]]'', ''[[Fasti Fratrum Arvalium]]'', and the \"so-called\" ''[[Fasti Maffeani]]'' = ''Inscriptiones Italiae'' XIII.2.377.</ref> record Mercatus Apollinares, July 14\u201319; Mercatus Romani, September 20\u201323; and Mercatus Plebeii, November 18\u201320. Others may have existed. The English word \"fair\" derives from Latin ''feria''.<ref>Claire Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome: The Retail Trade in the Late Republic and the Principate'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), pp. 189\u2013190, 193.</ref>\n\n==\"Roman holidays\" as trope==\nBy the outset of the nineteenth century and particularly in response to the carnage of the latter years of the French revolution, the term '''Roman holiday''' had taken on sinister aspects, implying an event that occasions enjoyment or profit at the expense, or derived from the suffering, of others, as in this passage from ''Childe Harold's Pilgrimage'' (1812\u201318) by George Gordon, Lord Byron:\n\n<blockquote>There were his young barbarians all at play,<br>There was their Dacian mother\u2014he their sire,<br>Butchered to make a Roman holiday.\"<ref>\"Cruelty\". The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase, Saying, and Quotation, 2nd edition. Susan Ratcliffe, ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2002,109-110.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMore benignly, the phrase was used as the title of a romantic movie set in Rome, ''[[Roman Holiday]].''\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fasti]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Roman religion (festival)}}\n{{Ancient Rome topics}\n{{Roman religion}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Roman Festivals}}\n[[Category:Ancient Roman festivals| ]]\n", "name_user": "24.146.218.229", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eList of festivals by month)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_festivals"}

Directly north-west, Affetside Moor rises to a height of more than 900&nbsp;ft above sea level and further north Top of Quarlton and Holcombe Moor dominate the skyline. From elevated parts of the town Scout Moor, Harden Moor and Knowl Hill are visible to the east. The villages of Affetside, Greenmount and Hawkshaw are north of the town, with Walshaw to the south west. Until the post-war period Tottington was a ribbon development along the Bury to Blackburn road, the Kirklees Valley to the east stopped development in that direction and kept Tottington distinct from [[Brandlesholme]]. Within the Kirklees Valley there are a number of artificial mill ponds and reservoirs created during Tottington's industrial heyday. Many of these have since dried up, but the remaining examples have proven an ideal habitat for numerous species of wildfowl and bats.<ref>[http://www.slbg.org.uk/Technical%20Report%202007.pdf Bat Activity Survey over millponds in South Lancashire] South Lancashire Bat Group</ref>\n\nThe [[superficial deposits|superficial geology]] beneath Tottington consists of [[Devensian]] [[glacial till]]s, which overlie the [[Pennine Coal Measures Group|Lower Pennine Coal Measures]]; the same sequences of [[sandstones]], [[mudstones]] and [[coal seam]]s that form the [[Lancashire Coalfield]].

In 1933 two acres of the urban district were added to the [[County Borough of Bury]].<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10002928 Boundary Changes] Tottington Urban District history</ref> Since 1974, as part of the provisions of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the urban district has been part of [[Bury Metropolitan Borough Council|Bury Metropolitan Borough]].<ref name=\"manchester2002-uk.com\"/> One of the last actions of the UDC was the creation of Old Kay's Park, named after [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]], the park was created as a bulwark against further development encircling the community.<ref name=\"Lancashire Life\" /> The metropolitan council partially resurrected Tottington Lower End when it created the [[Township (England)|township forum]] of Tottington, North Manor and Ramsbottom, which covers much the same area.<ref>[http://www.bury.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=5943 Ramsbottom, Tottington and North Manor Township Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320011930/http://www.bury.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=5943 |date=20 March 2015 }} Bury Council</ref> The UDC territory broadly correlates with the Tottington ward of Bury Council and returns three Councillors.

The constituency was previously represented by James Frith (Labour 2017-2019),  [[David Nuttall]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], 2010\u20132017), [[David Chaytor]] (Labour, 1997\u20132010) and Alistair Burt (Conservative 1983-1997).\n\n== Geography and geology ==\nTottington's physical geography is characterised by its position at the edge of the [[West Pennine Moors]] and the [[Rossendale Valley]]. Directly north-west, Affetside Moor rises to a height of more than 900&nbsp;ft above sea level and further north Top of Quarlton and Holcombe Moor dominate the skyline. From elevated parts of the town Scout Moor, Harden Moor and Knowl Hill are visible to the east. The villages of Affetside, Greenmount and Hawkshaw are north of the town, with Walshaw to the south west. Until the post-war period Tottington was a ribbon development along the Bury to Blackburn road, the Kirklees Valley to the east stopped development in that direction and kept Tottington distinct from [[Brandlesholme]]. Within the Kirklees Valley there are a number of artificial mill ponds and reservoirs created during Tottington's industrial heyday. Many of these have since dried up, but the remaining examples have proven an ideal habitat for numerous species of wildfowl and bats.<ref>[http://www.slbg.org.uk/Technical%20Report%202007.pdf Bat Activity Survey over millponds in South Lancashire] South Lancashire Bat Group</ref>\n\nThe [[superficial deposits|superficial geology]] beneath Tottington consists of [[Devensian]] [[glacial till]]s, which overlie the [[Pennine Coal Measures Group|Lower Pennine Coal Measures]]; the same sequences of [[sandstones]], [[mudstones]] and [[coal seam]]s that form the [[Lancashire Coalfield]].

In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor or centralize the defining features of that particular [[taxon]]. In older usage (pre-1900 in botany), a type was a taxon rather than a specimen.<ref name=Hitchcock/>\n\nA taxon is a scientifically named grouping of organisms with other like organisms, a [[set (mathematics)|set]] that includes some organisms and excludes others, based on a detailed published description (for example a [[species description]]) and on the provision of type material, which is usually available to scientists for examination in a major museum research collection, or similar institution.<ref name=Hitchcock>{{citation |author=Hitchcock, A.S. |year=1921 |title=The Type Concept in Systematic Botany |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=251\u2013255 |jstor=2434993 |doi=10.2307/2434993}}</ref><ref name=Smithsonian>{{cite web|last1=Nicholson|first1=Dan H.|title=Botanical nomenclature, types, & standard reference works|url=http://botany.si.edu/references/botlinks/dhntyp.htm|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Department of Botany|accessdate=17 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Type specimen==\nAccording to a precise set of rules laid down in the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN), the scientific name of every taxon is almost always based on one particular ''specimen'', or in some cases specimens. Types are of great significance to biologists, especially to [[taxonomist]]s. Types are usually physical specimens that are kept in a [[museum]] or [[herbarium]] research collection, but failing that, an image of an individual of that taxon has sometimes been designated as a type.<ref name=\"MarshallEvenhuis2015\">{{cite journal|last2=Evenhuis|first2=Neal L.|last1=Marshall|first1=Stephen A.|title=New species without dead bodies: a case for photo-based descriptions, illustrated by a striking new species of ''Marleyimyia'' Hesse (Diptera, Bombyliidae) from South Africa |journal=ZooKeys |volume=525 |year=2015 |pages=117\u2013127 |issn=1313-2970 |doi=10.3897/zookeys.525.6143 |pmid=26487819 |pmc=4607853}}</ref> Describing species and appointing type specimens is part of [[scientific nomenclature]] and [[alpha taxonomy]].\n\nWhen identifying material, a scientist attempts to apply a taxon name to a specimen or group of specimens based on his or her understanding of the relevant taxa, based on (at least) having read the type description(s), preferably based on an examination of all the type material of all of the relevant taxa. If there is more than one named type that all appear to be the same taxon, then the oldest name takes precedence, and is considered to be the correct name of the material in hand. If on the other hand the taxon appears never to have been named at all, then the scientist or another qualified expert picks a type specimen and publishes a new name and an official description.\n\nThis process is crucial to the science of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. People's ideas of how living things should be grouped change and shift over time. How do we know that what we call \"''[[Canis lupus]]''\" is the same thing,  or approximately the same thing, as what they will be calling \"''Canis lupus''\" in 200 years' time? It is possible to check this because there is a particular wolf specimen preserved in Sweden<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-037-01-0001.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115145/http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-037-01-0001.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and everyone who uses that name \u2013 no matter what else they may mean by it \u2013 will include that particular specimen.\n\nDepending on the [[Nomenclature Codes|nomenclature code]] applied to the organism in question, a type can be a specimen, a culture, an [[Biological illustration|illustration]], or (under the bacteriological code) a description. Some codes consider a subordinate taxon to be the type, but under the botanical code the type is always a specimen or illustration.\n\nFor example, in the research collection of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London, there is a bird specimen numbered 1886.6.24.20. This is a specimen of a kind of bird commonly known as the [[spotted harrier]], which currently bears the scientific name ''Circus assimilis''. This particular specimen is the [[holotype]] for that species; the name ''Circus assimilis'' refers, by definition, to the species of that particular specimen. That species was named and described by Jardine and Selby in 1828, and the holotype was placed in the museum collection so that other scientists might refer to it as necessary.\n\nNote that at least for type specimens there is no requirement for a \"typical\" individual to be used. [[Genera]] and [[family (biology)|families]], particularly those established by early taxonomists, tend to be named after species that are more \"typical\" for them, but here too this is not always the case and due to changes in [[systematics]] ''cannot'' be. Hence, the term [[name-bearing type]] or onomatophore is sometimes used, to denote the fact that biological types do not define \"typical\" individuals or [[taxa]], but rather fix a scientific name to a specific [[wiktionary:operational taxonomic unit|operational taxonomic unit]]. Type specimens are theoretically even allowed to be aberrant or deformed individuals or color variations, though this is rarely chosen to be the case, as it makes it hard to determine to which population the individual belonged.<ref name=\"Hitchcock\" /><ref name=\"Smithsonian\" /><ref name=CANBR>{{cite web|title=Plant names \u2013 a basic introduction|url=http://www.cpbr.gov.au/chah/avh/help/names/|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens, Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research|accessdate=17 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe usage of the term ''type'' is somewhat complicated by slightly different uses in [[botany]] and [[zoology]].

A specimen is a real plant (or one or more parts of a plant or a lot of small plants), dead and kept safe, \"curated\", in a [[herbarium]] (or the equivalent for fungi). Examples of where an illustration may serve as a type include:\n* A detailed drawing, painting, etc., depicting the plant, from the early days of plant taxonomy. A dried plant was difficult to transport and hard to keep safe for the future; many specimens from the early days of botany have since been lost or damaged. Highly skilled botanical artists were sometimes employed by a botanist to make a faithful and detailed illustration. Some such illustrations have become the best record and have been chosen to serve as the type of a taxon.\n* A detailed picture of something that can be seen only through a [[microscope]]. A tiny \"plant\" on a [[microscope slide]] makes for a poor type: the microscope slide may be lost or damaged, or it may be very difficult to find the \"plant\" in question among whatever else is on the microscope slide. An illustration makes for a much more reliable type (Art 37.5 of the ''Vienna Code'', 2006).\n\nNote that a type does not determine the [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the taxon. For example, the common [[dandelion]] is a controversial taxon: some botanists consider it to consist of over a hundred species, and others regard it as a single species. The type of the name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same whether the circumscription of the species includes all those small species (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a \"big\" species) or whether the circumscription is limited to only one small species among the other hundred (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a \"small\" species). The name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same and the type of the name is the same, but the extent of what the name actually applies to varies greatly. Setting the circumscription of a taxon is done by a taxonomist in a publication.\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\n# Only a species or an [[infraspecific taxon]] can have a type of its own. For most new [[taxon|taxa]] (published on or after 1 January 2007, article 37) at these ranks a type should not be an illustration.\n# A [[genus]] has the same type as that of one of its [[species]] (article 10).\n# A [[Family (biology)|family]] has the same type as that of one of its [[genus|genera]] (article 10).\n\nThe ''ICN'' provides a listing of the various kinds of type (article 9 and the Glossary),<ref name=ICN>{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G.

The type of a genus or subgenus is a species. The type of a suprageneric taxon (e.g., family, etc.) is a genus. Names higher than superfamily rank do not have types. A \"name-bearing type\" is a specimen or image that \"provides the objective standard of reference whereby the application of the name of a nominal taxon can be determined.\"\n\n===Definitions===\n* A type specimen is a vernacular term (not a formally defined term) typically used for an individual or fossil that is any of the various name-bearing types for a [[species]]. For example, the type specimen for the species ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' was the specimen \"Neanderthal-1\" discovered by [[Johann Karl Fuhlrott]] in 1856 at Feldhofer in the Neander Valley in Germany, consisting of a [[Calvaria (skull)|skullcap]], thigh bones, part of a pelvis, some ribs, and some arm and shoulder bones. There may be more than one type specimen, but there is (at least in modern times) only one holotype.\n* A [[type species]] is the [[nominal species]] that is the name-bearing type of a nominal [[genus]] or [[subgenus]].\n* A [[type genus]] is the [[nominal genus]] that is the name-bearing type of a nominal family-group taxon.\n* The [[type series]] are all those specimens included by the author in a taxon's formal description, unless the author explicitly or implicitly excludes them as part of the series.\n\n===Use of type specimens===\n[[File:Mormopterus acetabulosus type illustration.jpg|thumb|Type illustration of ''[[Mormopterus acetabulosus]]'']]\nAlthough in reality biologists may examine many specimens (when available) of a new taxon before writing an official published species description, nonetheless, under the formal rules for naming species (the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature), a single type must be designated, as part of the published description.\n\nA type description must include a diagnosis (typically, a discussion of similarities to and differences from closely related species), and an indication of where the type specimen or specimens are deposited for examination. The geographical location where a type specimen was originally found is known as its '''{{visible anchor|type locality}}'''. In the case of parasites, the term '''{{visible anchor|type host}}''' (or symbiotype) is used to indicate the host organism from which the type specimen was obtained.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3283335|title=Designation and Curatorial Management of Type Host Specimens (Symbiotypes) for New Parasite Species|jstor=3283335|author1=Frey, Jennifer K. |author2=Yates, Terry L. |author3=Duszynski, Donald W. |author4=Gannon, William L. |author5=Gardner, Scott L. |last-author-amp=yes |journal=The Journal of Parasitology| volume=78|issue=5|year=1992| pages=930\u2013993}}</ref>\n\nZoological collections are maintained by universities and museums. Ensuring that types are kept in good condition and made available for examination by taxonomists are two important functions of such collections. And, while there is only one ''holotype'' designated, there can be other \"type\" specimens, the following of which are formally defined:\n\n====Holotype====\n{{main|Holotype}}\nWhen a single specimen is clearly designated in the original description, this specimen is known as the ''holotype'' of that species. The holotype is typically placed in a major museum, or similar well-known public collection, so that it is freely available for later examination by other biologists.\n\n====Paratype====\n{{main|Paratype}}\nWhen the original description designated a holotype, there may still be additional specimens listed in the type series and those are termed paratypes. These are not [[name-bearing type]]s.\n\n====Allotype====\nAn allotype is a specimen of the opposite sex to the holotype, designated from among paratypes. It was also formerly used for a specimen that shows features not seen in the holotype of a fossil.<ref name=\"Hawksworth2010\"/> The term is not regulated by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]].\n\n====Neotype====\nA neotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen when an original holotype has been lost or destroyed or where the original author never cited a specimen.\n\n====Syntype====\n{{Main|Syntype}}\nA syntype is any one of two or more specimens that is listed in a species description where no holotype was designated; historically, syntypes were often explicitly designated as such, and under the present ICZN this is a requirement, but modern attempts to publish species description based on syntypes are generally frowned upon by practicing taxonomists, and most are gradually being replaced by lectotypes. Those that still exist are still considered name-bearing types.\n\nWhhhhooooops\n\n====Paralectotype====\nA paralectotype is any additional specimen from among a set of syntypes, after a lectotype has been designated from among them. These are not name-bearing types.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Hansen, Hans V. |author2=Seberg, Ole |title=Paralectotype, a new type term in botany |journal=Taxon |year=1984 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=707\u2013711 |jstor=1220790 |doi=10.2307/1220790}}</ref>\n\n====Hapantotype====\nA special case in [[Protistan]]s where the type consists of two or more specimens of \"directly related individuals representing distinct stages in the life cycle\"; these are collectively treated as a single entity, and lectotypes cannot be designated from among them.\n\n==== Iconotype ====\nAn illustration on which a new species or subspecies was based.

Assuming there is no future question as to the status of such a species, the absence of a type specimen does not invalidate the name, but it may be necessary in the future to designate a neotype for such a taxon, should any questions arise. However, in the case of the bushshrike, ornithologists have argued that the specimen was a rare and hitherto unknown [[morph (zoology)|color morph]] of a long-known species, using only the available blood and feather samples. While there is still some debate on the need to deposit actual killed individuals as type specimens, it can be observed that given proper vouchering and storage, tissue samples can be just as valuable should disputes about the validity of a species arise.\n\n====Formalisation of the type system====\nThe various types listed above are necessary{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} because many species were described one or two centuries ago, when a single type specimen, a holotype, was often not designated. Also, types were not always carefully preserved, and intervening events such as wars and fires have resulted in destruction of original type material. The validity of a species name often rests upon the availability of original type specimens; or, if the type cannot be found, or one has never existed, upon the clarity of the description.\n\nThe ICZN has existed only since 1961, when the first edition of the Code was published. The ICZN does not always demand a type specimen for the historical validity of a species, and many \"type-less\" species do exist. The current edition of the Code, Article 75.3, prohibits the designation of a [[neotype]] unless there is \"an exceptional need\" for \"clarifying the taxonomic status\" of a species (Article 75.2).\n\nThere are many other permutations and variations on terms using the suffix \"-type\" (e.g., [[allotype (nomenclature)|allotype]], cotype, [[topotype]], [[generitype]], [[isotype (biology)|isotype]], isoneotype, isolectotype, etc.) but these are not formally regulated by the Code, and a great many are obsolete and/or idiosyncratic. However, some of these categories can potentially apply to genuine type specimens, such as a neotype; e.g., isotypic/topotypic specimens are preferred to other specimens, when they are available at the time a neotype is chosen (because they are from the same time and/or place as the original type).\n\nThe term fixation is used by the Code for the declaration of a name-bearing type, whether by original or subsequent designation.\n\n===Type species===\n{{Main|Type species}}\n[[File:Bufo bufo (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|The [[common toad]], ''Bufo bufo'' described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], is the type species for the genus ''[[Bufo]]'']]\nEach genus must have a designated type species (the term \"genotype\" was once used for this but has been abandoned because the word has become much better known as the term for [[genotype|a different concept]] in [[genetics]]). The description of a genus is usually based primarily on its type species, modified and expanded by the features of other included species. The generic name is permanently associated with the name-bearing type of its type species.\n\nIdeally, a type species best exemplifies the essential characteristics of the genus to which it belongs, but this is subjective and, ultimately, technically irrelevant, as it is not a requirement of the Code. If the type species proves, upon closer examination, to belong to a pre-existing genus (a common occurrence), then all of the constituent species must be either moved into the pre-existing genus, or disassociated from the original type species and given a new generic name; the old generic name passes into synonymy and is abandoned unless there is a pressing need to make an exception (decided case-by-case, via petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Type genus===\n{{Main|Type genus}}\nA type genus is that genus from which the name of a [[family (biology)|family]] or subfamily is formed. As with type species, the type genus is not necessarily the most representative, but is usually the earliest described, largest or best known genus. It is not uncommon for the name of a family to be based upon the name of a type genus that has passed into synonymy; the family name does not need to be changed in such a situation.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Archetype]]\n* [[Glossary of scientific naming]]\n* [[Nomen dubium]] (zoology)\n* [[Nomen nudum]]\n* [[Genetypes]] - genetic sequence data from type specimens\n* [[Pathotype]] \u2013 a type of an intrasubspecific taxon of pathogenic bacteria\n* [[Principle of Typification]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==<!-- Zootaxa 1761: 37 -->\n* ''ICZN Code'': [http://www.iczn.org/ International Code of Zoological Nomenclature], the official website\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050523194453/http://filaman.uni-kiel.de/LarvalBase/Glossary/Glossary.cfm?TermEnglish=type%20species Fishbase] Glossary section.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110927151620/http://pages.unibas.ch/museum/microfossils/Colls_NMB/GENERALS/COMTYPES.HTML A compendium of terms]\n* [http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/publications/pdf/bm-tp41.pdf  Zoological Type Nomenclature (Evenhuis)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Type}}\n[[Category:Biological concepts]]\n[[Category:Taxonomy (biology)]]\n[[Category:Zoological nomenclature]]\n[[Category:Botanical nomenclature]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Type specimen|the mineralogy term|type specimen (mineralogy)}}\n{{short description|Specimen(s) to which a scientific name is formally attached}}\n\n[[File:Marocaster coronatus MHNT.PAL.2010.2.2 (Close up).jpg|thumb|right|Type specimen for ''[[Marocaster coronatus]]'' - [[Mus\u00e9um de Toulouse]]]]\nIn biology, a '''type''' is a particular [[wiktionary:en:specimen|specimen]] (or in some cases a group of specimens) of an [[organism]] to which the [[scientific name]] of that organism is formally attached.

Types are of great significance to biologists, especially to [[taxonomist]]s. Types are usually physical specimens that are kept in a [[museum]] or [[herbarium]] research collection, but failing that, an image of an individual of that taxon has sometimes been designated as a type.<ref name=\"MarshallEvenhuis2015\">{{cite journal|last2=Evenhuis|first2=Neal L.|last1=Marshall|first1=Stephen A.|title=New species without dead bodies: a case for photo-based descriptions, illustrated by a striking new species of ''Marleyimyia'' Hesse (Diptera, Bombyliidae) from South Africa |journal=ZooKeys |volume=525 |year=2015 |pages=117\u2013127 |issn=1313-2970 |doi=10.3897/zookeys.525.6143 |pmid=26487819 |pmc=4607853}}</ref> Describing species and appointing type specimens is part of [[scientific nomenclature]] and [[alpha taxonomy]].\n\nWhen identifying material, a scientist attempts to apply a taxon name to a specimen or group of specimens based on his or her understanding of the relevant taxa, based on (at least) having read the type description(s), preferably based on an examination of all the type material of all of the relevant taxa. If there is more than one named type that all appear to be the same taxon, then the oldest name takes precedence, and is considered to be the correct name of the material in hand. If on the other hand the taxon appears never to have been named at all, then the scientist or another qualified expert picks a type specimen and publishes a new name and an official description.\n\nThis process is crucial to the science of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. People's ideas of how living things should be grouped change and shift over time. How do we know that what we call \"''[[Canis lupus]]''\" is the same thing,  or approximately the same thing, as what they will be calling \"''Canis lupus''\" in 200 years' time? It is possible to check this because there is a particular wolf specimen preserved in Sweden<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-037-01-0001.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115145/http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-037-01-0001.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and everyone who uses that name \u2013 no matter what else they may mean by it \u2013 will include that particular specimen.\n\nDepending on the [[Nomenclature Codes|nomenclature code]] applied to the organism in question, a type can be a specimen, a culture, an [[Biological illustration|illustration]], or (under the bacteriological code) a description. Some codes consider a subordinate taxon to be the type, but under the botanical code the type is always a specimen or illustration.\n\nFor example, in the research collection of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London, there is a bird specimen numbered 1886.6.24.20. This is a specimen of a kind of bird commonly known as the [[spotted harrier]], which currently bears the scientific name ''Circus assimilis''. This particular specimen is the [[holotype]] for that species; the name ''Circus assimilis'' refers, by definition, to the species of that particular specimen. That species was named and described by Jardine and Selby in 1828, and the holotype was placed in the museum collection so that other scientists might refer to it as necessary.\n\nNote that at least for type specimens there is no requirement for a \"typical\" individual to be used. [[Genera]] and [[family (biology)|families]], particularly those established by early taxonomists, tend to be named after species that are more \"typical\" for them, but here too this is not always the case and due to changes in [[systematics]] ''cannot'' be. Hence, the term [[name-bearing type]] or onomatophore is sometimes used, to denote the fact that biological types do not define \"typical\" individuals or [[taxa]], but rather fix a scientific name to a specific [[wiktionary:operational taxonomic unit|operational taxonomic unit]]. Type specimens are theoretically even allowed to be aberrant or deformed individuals or color variations, though this is rarely chosen to be the case, as it makes it hard to determine to which population the individual belonged.<ref name=\"Hitchcock\" /><ref name=\"Smithsonian\" /><ref name=CANBR>{{cite web|title=Plant names \u2013 a basic introduction|url=http://www.cpbr.gov.au/chah/avh/help/names/|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens, Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research|accessdate=17 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe usage of the term ''type'' is somewhat complicated by slightly different uses in [[botany]] and [[zoology]].

A specimen is a real plant (or one or more parts of a plant or a lot of small plants), dead and kept safe, \"curated\", in a [[herbarium]] (or the equivalent for fungi). Examples of where an illustration may serve as a type include:\n* A detailed drawing, painting, etc., depicting the plant, from the early days of plant taxonomy. A dried plant was difficult to transport and hard to keep safe for the future; many specimens from the early days of botany have since been lost or damaged. Highly skilled botanical artists were sometimes employed by a botanist to make a faithful and detailed illustration. Some such illustrations have become the best record and have been chosen to serve as the type of a taxon.\n* A detailed picture of something that can be seen only through a [[microscope]]. A tiny \"plant\" on a [[microscope slide]] makes for a poor type: the microscope slide may be lost or damaged, or it may be very difficult to find the \"plant\" in question among whatever else is on the microscope slide. An illustration makes for a much more reliable type (Art 37.5 of the ''Vienna Code'', 2006).\n\nNote that a type does not determine the [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the taxon. For example, the common [[dandelion]] is a controversial taxon: some botanists consider it to consist of over a hundred species, and others regard it as a single species. The type of the name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same whether the circumscription of the species includes all those small species (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a \"big\" species) or whether the circumscription is limited to only one small species among the other hundred (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a \"small\" species). The name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same and the type of the name is the same, but the extent of what the name actually applies to varies greatly. Setting the circumscription of a taxon is done by a taxonomist in a publication.\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\n# Only a species or an [[infraspecific taxon]] can have a type of its own. For most new [[taxon|taxa]] (published on or after 1 January 2007, article 37) at these ranks a type should not be an illustration.\n# A [[genus]] has the same type as that of one of its [[species]] (article 10).\n# A [[Family (biology)|family]] has the same type as that of one of its [[genus|genera]] (article 10).\n\nThe ''ICN'' provides a listing of the various kinds of type (article 9 and the Glossary),<ref name=ICN>{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G.

The type of a genus or subgenus is a species. The type of a suprageneric taxon (e.g., family, etc.) is a genus. Names higher than superfamily rank do not have types. A \"name-bearing type\" is a specimen or image that \"provides the objective standard of reference whereby the application of the name of a nominal taxon can be determined.\"\n\n===Definitions===\n* A type specimen is a vernacular term (not a formally defined term) typically used for an individual or fossil that is any of the various name-bearing types for a [[species]]. For example, the type specimen for the species ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' was the specimen \"Neanderthal-1\" discovered by [[Johann Karl Fuhlrott]] in 1856 at Feldhofer in the Neander Valley in Germany, consisting of a [[Calvaria (skull)|skullcap]], thigh bones, part of a pelvis, some ribs, and some arm and shoulder bones. There may be more than one type specimen, but there is (at least in modern times) only one holotype.\n* A [[type species]] is the [[nominal species]] that is the name-bearing type of a nominal [[genus]] or [[subgenus]].\n* A [[type genus]] is the [[nominal genus]] that is the name-bearing type of a nominal family-group taxon.\n* The [[type series]] are all those specimens included by the author in a taxon's formal description, unless the author explicitly or implicitly excludes them as part of the series.\n\n===Use of type specimens===\n[[File:Mormopterus acetabulosus type illustration.jpg|thumb|Type illustration of ''[[Mormopterus acetabulosus]]'']]\nAlthough in reality biologists may examine many specimens (when available) of a new taxon before writing an official published species description, nonetheless, under the formal rules for naming species (the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature), a single type must be designated, as part of the published description.\n\nA type description must include a diagnosis (typically, a discussion of similarities to and differences from closely related species), and an indication of where the type specimen or specimens are deposited for examination. The geographical location where a type specimen was originally found is known as its '''{{visible anchor|type locality}}'''. In the case of parasites, the term '''{{visible anchor|type host}}''' (or symbiotype) is used to indicate the host organism from which the type specimen was obtained.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3283335|title=Designation and Curatorial Management of Type Host Specimens (Symbiotypes) for New Parasite Species|jstor=3283335|author1=Frey, Jennifer K. |author2=Yates, Terry L. |author3=Duszynski, Donald W. |author4=Gannon, William L. |author5=Gardner, Scott L. |last-author-amp=yes |journal=The Journal of Parasitology| volume=78|issue=5|year=1992| pages=930\u2013993}}</ref>\n\nZoological collections are maintained by universities and museums. Ensuring that types are kept in good condition and made available for examination by taxonomists are two important functions of such collections. And, while there is only one ''holotype'' designated, there can be other \"type\" specimens, the following of which are formally defined:\n\n====Holotype====\n{{main|Holotype}}\nWhen a single specimen is clearly designated in the original description, this specimen is known as the ''holotype'' of that species. The holotype is typically placed in a major museum, or similar well-known public collection, so that it is freely available for later examination by other biologists.\n\n====Paratype====\n{{main|Paratype}}\nWhen the original description designated a holotype, there may still be additional specimens listed in the type series and those are termed paratypes. These are not [[name-bearing type]]s.\n\n====Allotype====\nAn allotype is a specimen of the opposite sex to the holotype, designated from among paratypes. It was also formerly used for a specimen that shows features not seen in the holotype of a fossil.<ref name=\"Hawksworth2010\"/> The term is not regulated by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]].\n\n====Neotype====\nA neotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen when an original holotype has been lost or destroyed or where the original author never cited a specimen.\n\n====Syntype====\n{{Main|Syntype}}\nA syntype is any one of two or more specimens that is listed in a species description where no holotype was designated; historically, syntypes were often explicitly designated as such, and under the present ICZN this is a requirement, but modern attempts to publish species description based on syntypes are generally frowned upon by practicing taxonomists, and most are gradually being replaced by lectotypes. Those that still exist are still considered name-bearing types.\n\n====Lectotype====\nA lectotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen for species originally described from a set of [[syntype]]s.\nIn zoology, a lectotype is a kind of [[name-bearing type]]. When a species was originally described on the basis of a name-bearing type consisting of multiple specimens, one of those may be designated as the lectotype. Having a single name-bearing type reduces the potential for confusion, especially considering that it is not uncommon for a series of syntypes to contain specimens of more than one species.\n\nA notable example is that [[Carl Linnaeus]] is the lectotype for the species ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stearn|first=W.

Assuming there is no future question as to the status of such a species, the absence of a type specimen does not invalidate the name, but it may be necessary in the future to designate a neotype for such a taxon, should any questions arise. However, in the case of the bushshrike, ornithologists have argued that the specimen was a rare and hitherto unknown [[morph (zoology)|color morph]] of a long-known species, using only the available blood and feather samples. While there is still some debate on the need to deposit actual killed individuals as type specimens, it can be observed that given proper vouchering and storage, tissue samples can be just as valuable should disputes about the validity of a species arise.\n\n====Formalisation of the type system====\nThe various types listed above are necessary{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} because many species were described one or two centuries ago, when a single type specimen, a holotype, was often not designated. Also, types were not always carefully preserved, and intervening events such as wars and fires have resulted in destruction of original type material. The validity of a species name often rests upon the availability of original type specimens; or, if the type cannot be found, or one has never existed, upon the clarity of the description.\n\nThe ICZN has existed only since 1961, when the first edition of the Code was published. The ICZN does not always demand a type specimen for the historical validity of a species, and many \"type-less\" species do exist. The current edition of the Code, Article 75.3, prohibits the designation of a [[neotype]] unless there is \"an exceptional need\" for \"clarifying the taxonomic status\" of a species (Article 75.2).\n\nThere are many other permutations and variations on terms using the suffix \"-type\" (e.g., [[allotype (nomenclature)|allotype]], cotype, [[topotype]], [[generitype]], [[isotype (biology)|isotype]], isoneotype, isolectotype, etc.) but these are not formally regulated by the Code, and a great many are obsolete and/or idiosyncratic. However, some of these categories can potentially apply to genuine type specimens, such as a neotype; e.g., isotypic/topotypic specimens are preferred to other specimens, when they are available at the time a neotype is chosen (because they are from the same time and/or place as the original type).\n\nThe term fixation is used by the Code for the declaration of a name-bearing type, whether by original or subsequent designation.\n\n===Type species===\n{{Main|Type species}}\n[[File:Bufo bufo (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|The [[common toad]], ''Bufo bufo'' described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], is the type species for the genus ''[[Bufo]]'']]\nEach genus must have a designated type species (the term \"genotype\" was once used for this but has been abandoned because the word has become much better known as the term for [[genotype|a different concept]] in [[genetics]]). The description of a genus is usually based primarily on its type species, modified and expanded by the features of other included species. The generic name is permanently associated with the name-bearing type of its type species.\n\nIdeally, a type species best exemplifies the essential characteristics of the genus to which it belongs, but this is subjective and, ultimately, technically irrelevant, as it is not a requirement of the Code. If the type species proves, upon closer examination, to belong to a pre-existing genus (a common occurrence), then all of the constituent species must be either moved into the pre-existing genus, or disassociated from the original type species and given a new generic name; the old generic name passes into synonymy and is abandoned unless there is a pressing need to make an exception (decided case-by-case, via petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Type genus===\n{{Main|Type genus}}\nA type genus is that genus from which the name of a [[family (biology)|family]] or subfamily is formed. As with type species, the type genus is not necessarily the most representative, but is usually the earliest described, largest or best known genus. It is not uncommon for the name of a family to be based upon the name of a type genus that has passed into synonymy; the family name does not need to be changed in such a situation.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Archetype]]\n* [[Glossary of scientific naming]]\n* [[Nomen dubium]] (zoology)\n* [[Nomen nudum]]\n* [[Genetypes]] - genetic sequence data from type specimens\n* [[Pathotype]] \u2013 a type of an intrasubspecific taxon of pathogenic bacteria\n* [[Principle of Typification]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==<!-- Zootaxa 1761: 37 -->\n* ''ICZN Code'': [http://www.iczn.org/ International Code of Zoological Nomenclature], the official website\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050523194453/http://filaman.uni-kiel.de/LarvalBase/Glossary/Glossary.cfm?TermEnglish=type%20species Fishbase] Glossary section.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110927151620/http://pages.unibas.ch/museum/microfossils/Colls_NMB/GENERALS/COMTYPES.HTML A compendium of terms]\n* [http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/publications/pdf/bm-tp41.pdf  Zoological Type Nomenclature (Evenhuis)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Type}}\n[[Category:Biological concepts]]\n[[Category:Taxonomy (biology)]]\n[[Category:Zoological nomenclature]]\n[[Category:Botanical nomenclature]]\n", "name_user": "2601:586:500:5330:d05d:9867:6dcc:e024", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}
