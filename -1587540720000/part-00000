An acetate is a negative ion with the chemical formula of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>.  Deacetylation can be performed by either chemical hydrolysis or [[acetylesterase]].  Chemical hydrolysis is the cleavage of a chemical bond by addition of water.  In the reaction, water (H<sub>2</sub>O) reacts with the [[ethyl acetate|acetic ester]] functional group attached the cellulose polymer chain and forms an [[alcohol]] and [[acetate]].  The alcohol is simply the cellulose polymer chain with the acetate replaced with an alcohol group. The second reaction is exactly the same as chemical hydrolysis with the exception of the use of an [[acetylesterase]] enzyme.  The enzyme, found in most plants, [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the [[chemical reaction]] shown below.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Acetylesterase-mediated deacetylation of pectin impairs cell elongation, pollen germination, and plant reproduction |date=January 2012 |pmid=22247250|doi=10.1105/tpc.111.092411|volume=24|issue=1|pmc=3289554|journal=Plant Cell|pages=50\u201365 | last1 = Gou | first1 = JY | last2 = Miller | first2 = LM | last3 = Hou | first3 = G | last4 = Yu | first4 = XH | last5 = Chen | first5 = XY | last6 = Liu | first6 = CJ}}{{dead link|date=July 2015}}</ref>\n:acetic ester + H<sub>2</sub>O  {{eqm}} alcohol + acetate\nIn the case of the enzymatic reaction, the two substrates (reactants) are again [[acetic ester]] and H<sub>2</sub>O, the two [[product (chemistry)|products]] of the reaction are [[alcohol]] and [[acetate]].  This reaction is exactly the same as the chemical hydrolysis.  Both of these products are perfectly fine in the environment. Once the acetate group is removed from the cellulose chain, the polymer can be readily degraded by [[cellulase]], which is another enzyme found in [[fungus|fungi]], [[bacteria]], and [[protozoa]]ns. Cellulases break down the cellulose molecule into monosaccharides (\"simple sugars\") such as beta-[[glucose]], or shorter [[polysaccharide]]s and [[oligosaccharide]]s. [[File:Cellulos to glycose.png|thumb|400 px|The chemical structure change of cellulose into glucose]]These simple sugars are not harmful to the environment and are in fact are a useful product for many plants and animals.  The breakdown of cellulose is of interest in the field of biofuel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/jin2/|title=Breaking Down Cellulose|website=large.stanford.edu}}</ref> Due to the conditions that affect the process, large variation in the degradation time of cellulose acetate occurs.\n\n=== Factors in biodegradation ===\nThe duration of the biodegradation process is cited as taking as little as one month<ref name=bat/> to as long as 15 years or more, depending on the environmental conditions. The major factor that affects the biodegradation duration is the availability of acetylesterase and cellulase enzymes.  Without these enzymes, biodegradation only occurs through chemical hydrolysis and stops there.  Temperature is another major factor, if the organisms that contain the enzymes are too cold to grow, then biodegradation is severely hindered.  Availability of oxygen in the environment also affects the degradation.  Cellulose acetate is degraded within 2\u20133 weeks under [[Aerobic respiration|aerobic]] assay systems of ''[[in vitro]]'' enrichment cultivation techniques and an activated sludge wastewater treatment system.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Buchanan CM, Garder RM, Komarek RJ |title=Aerobic biodegradation of cellulose acetate |journal=Journal of Applied Polymer Science |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=1709\u20131719 |date=1993 |doi=10.1002/app.1993.070471001}}</ref> It is degraded within 14 weeks under [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] conditions of incubation with special cultures of fungi.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Rivard CJ, Adney WS, Himmel ME, Mitchell DJ, Vinzant TB, Grohmann K, Moens L, Chum H |title=Effects of Natural Polymer Acetlation on the anaerobic Dioconversion to Methane and Carbon Dioxide |journal=Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology |volume=34/35 |pages=725\u2013736 |date=1992 |doi=10.1007/bf02920592|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1232570 }}</ref> Ideal conditions were used for the degradation (i.e. right temperature, and available organisms to provide the enzymes).  Thus, filters last longer in places with low oxygen concentration (ex. swamps and bogs).  Overall, the biodegraditon process of cellulose acetate is not an instantaneous process.\n\n=== Photodegradation ===\nThe other process of degradation is [[photodegradation]], which is when a molecular bond is broken by the absorption of photon radiation (i.e. light).

Thus, the primary photodegradation of cellulose acetate is considered insignificant to the total degradation process, since cellulose acetate and its impurities absorb light at shorter wavelengths.  Research is focused on the secondary mechanisms of photodegradation of cellulose acetate to help make up for some of the limitations of biodegradation.  The secondary mechanisms would be the addition of a compound to the filters that would be able to absorb natural light and use it to start the degradation process.  The main two areas of research are in photocatalytic oxidation<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allergyclean.com/news/uvpcoformaldehyde.htm |title=Study on Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO) Raises Questions About Formaldehyde as a Byproduct in Indoor Air |accessdate=30 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426065810/http://allergyclean.com/news/uvpcoformaldehyde.htm |archivedate=26 April 2015 }}</ref> and photosensitized degradation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/458153/photosensitization|title=photosensitization - chemistry|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref> Photocatalytic oxidation uses a species that absorbs radiation and creates hydroxyl radicals that react with the filters and start the breakdown.

The product is showing high promise as a green alternative for the waste problem.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Minzae L, Gil-Pyo K, Hyeon DS, Soomin P, Jongheop Y |title=Preparation of energy storage material derived from a used cigarette filter for a supercapacitor electrode |journal= Nanotechnology|volume=25 |issue=34 |page=34 |date=2014 |doi=10.1088/0957-4484/25/34/345601 |pmid=25092115 |bibcode=2014Nanot..25H5601L |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/98a6ed2ae5a1e047264d8003c199d1cc0980a30a }}</ref>\n\n<!-- == Prices ==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3|\n|-\n!nowrap|'''Country/Territory'''\n!nowrap|'''USD/20 pack'''\n!nowrap|'''\u20ac/20 pack'''\n!nowrap|'''Local currency/20 pack'''\n!nowrap|'''Date of price'''\n!nowrap|'''Sources'''\n|-\n|Ireland\n|10.50\n|10.00\n|\u20ac10.00\n|2012-07-16\n|[http://www.independent.ie/business/budget/exclusive-price-of-cigarettes-to-rise-to-10-a-pack-30662237.html]\n|-\n|United Kingdom\n|12\n|9.40\n|\u00a37.50\n|2012-03-21\n|[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/21/budget-2012-hits-smokers-37p]\n|-\n|New Zealand\n|13.13\n|10.10\n|NZ$16\n|2013-01-01\n|[http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8123959/Smokers-not-put-off-by-price-hike]\n|-\n|Philippines\n|1\n|0.75\n|Php.50\n|2013-06-05\n|-\n|Poland\n|4.75\n|3.70\n|15.50 PLN\n|2013-05-18\n|[http://www.fakt.pl/Papierosy-drozeja-Ceny-fajek-w-gore-Ile-kosztuja-papierosy-Ceny-papierosow-Podwyzka-papierosow-Akcyza-na-papierosy-w-gore-,artykuly,178454,1.html]\n|-\n|U.S. ([[New York]])\n|12.50\n|9.80\n|$12.50\n|2012-06-26\n|[http://www.theawl.com/2012/06/pack-of-cigarettes-cost]\n|-\n|U.S. ([[Virginia]])\n|4.60\n|3.50\n|$4.56\n|2013-04-11\n|[http://dcist.com/2013/04/with_proposed_tax_cigarette_prices.php]\n|-\n|Australia\n|17.80\n|14.10\n|A$20 (A$25/ 25 pack)\n|2014-08-31\n|[https://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/a-dollar-to-light-up-smokers-brace-for-another-jump-in-tobacco-excise-20140831-10aln2.html]\n|-\n|Norway\n|15.50\n|12.20\n|NOK90\n|2012-05-12\n|[http://www.newsinenglish.no/2012/05/14/duty-free-tobacco-comes-under-fire/]\n|-\n|Singapore\n|10\n|8\n|$12.00\n|2014-09-25\n|[http://www.expatistan.com/price/cigarretes/singapore]\n|-\n|Malaysia\n|3.97\n|3.10\n|13.00 RM\n|2014-09-25\n|[http://www.expatistan.com/price/cigarretes/kuala-lumpur]\n|-\n|South Africa\n|3.11\n|2.33\n|R31.00\n|2013-06-14\n|[http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=South+Africa]\n|-\n|Thailand\n|2.15\n|1.55\n|Baht 65.00\n|2014-09-02\n|\n|-\n|Canada ([[Manitoba]])\n|10.75\n|7.92\n|C$11.20 ($14/25 pack)\nC$9.60 ( 20 pack) British Columbia\n|\n|\n|-\n|Indonesia\n|1.59\n|1.24\n|Rp 19,075\n|2014-09-25\n|[http://www.expatistan.com/price/cigarretes/jakarta]\n|-\n|Romania\n|4.4\n|3.4\n|15 RON\n|2014-09-09 \n|[http://www.carrefour-online.ro/bauturi_si_tutun/tigari/]\n|-\n|India\n|2.9\n|2.57\n|INR 220\n|2015-01-21\n|[http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=India]\n|} -->\n\n== Consumption ==\n[[File:Cigarettecounter pd.jpg|thumb|A [[Woolworths (supermarket)|Woolworths]] supermarket cigarette counter in [[New South Wales]], Australia:  In January 2011, Australia prohibited the display of cigarettes in retail outlets countrywide.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/tobacco-display-ban-from-tomorrow-20101230-19b5h.html | title = Tobacco display ban from tomorrow | accessdate = 2012-06-28 | last = Willingham | first = Richard | date = 31 Dec 2010 | work = The Age(Melbourne) | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]]}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Mall culture jakarta43.jpg|thumb|Cigarette salespeople in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]\nSmoking has become less popular, but is still a large public health problem globally.

The significant reductions in smoking rates in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, and other countries that implemented strong tobacco control programs{{According to whom|date=December 2019}} have been offset by the increasing consumption in low income countries, especially China. The Chinese market now consumes more cigarettes than all other low- and middle-income countries combined.\n\nOther regions are increasingly playing larger roles in the growing global smoking epidemic. The WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO) now has the highest growth rate in the cigarette market, with more than a one-third increase in cigarette consumption since 2000. Due to its recent dynamic economic development and continued population growth, Africa presents the greatest risk in terms of future growth in tobacco use.\n\nWithin countries, patterns of cigarette consumption also can vary widely.\u00a0 For example, in many of the countries where few women smoke, smoking rates are often high in males (e.g., in Asia). By contrast, in most developed countries, female smoking rates are typically only a few percentage points below those of males. In many high and middle income countries lower socioeconomic status is a strong predictor of smoking.\u00a0\n\nSmoking rates in the United States have dropped by more than half from 1965 to 2016, falling from 42% to 15.5% of US adults.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alliedpay.com/high-risk-payment-processing/tobacco-merchant-account-services|title=Tobacco Merchant Account|date=2019-05-21|website=Allied Payments|access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref> Australia is cutting their overall smoking consumption faster than most of the developed world, in part due to landmark Plain Packaging Act, which standardized the appearance of cigarette packs.

The filter design is one of the main differences between light and regular cigarettes, although not all cigarettes contain perforated holes in the filter. In some light cigarettes, the filter is perforated with small holes that theoretically diffuse the [[tobacco]] smoke with clean air.  In regular cigarettes, the filter does not include these perforations.  In ultralight cigarettes, the filter's perforations are larger. The majority of major cigarette manufacturers offer a light, low-tar, and/or mild cigarette brand.  Due to recent U.S. legislation prohibiting the use of these descriptors, tobacco manufacturers are turning to color-coding to allow consumers to differentiate between regular and light brands.<ref name=\"Koch\">Koch 2009</ref>\n\nResearch shows that smoking \"light\" or \"low-tar\" cigarettes is just as harmful as smoking other cigarettes.<ref name=\"National\">U.S. National 2004</ref><ref name=\"Benowitz\">Benowitz 2005, p. 1</ref><ref>NCI\u2019s Smoking 2007, p.7</ref>\n\n== Notable cigarette brands ==\n{{main|List of cigarette brands}}\n[[File:Marlboro4wiki2.JPG|thumb|[[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]], one of the most well-known cigarette brands.]]\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[520 (cigarette)|520]]\n* [[State Express 555|555]]\n* [[Ashford (cigarette)|Ashford]]\n* [[Amber Leaf]] \n* [[Army Club (cigarette)|Army Club]]\n* Ardath\n* [[Basic (cigarette)|Basic]]\n* Bel Air\n* [[Benson & Hedges]]\n* Berkeley\n* [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]]\n* [[Capri (cigarette)|Capri]]\n* [[Chesterfield (cigarette)|Chesterfield]]\n* [[Davidoff]]\n* [[Dunhill (cigarette)|Dunhill]]\n* [[Djarum]]\n* [[Doral (cigarette)|Doral]]\n* [[du Maurier (cigarette)|du Maurier]]\n* [[Eclipse (cigarette)|Eclipse]]\n* [[Embassy (cigarette)|Embassy]]\n* [[Eve (cigarette)|Eve]]\n* [[Export A]]\n* [[Fatima (cigarette)|Fatima]]\n* [[Fortuna (cigarette)|Fortuna]]\n* [[Gauloises]]\n* [[Gitanes]]\n* [[Gold Flake]]\n* [[Golden Virginia]]\n* [[John Player & Sons|Gold Leaf]]\n* [[Kyriazi Freres]]\n* [[Kent (cigarette)|Kent]]\n* [[Kool (cigarette)|Kool]]\n* [[Lambert and Butler]]\n* [[L&M]]\n* [[Lark (cigarette)|Lark]]\n* [[Lucky Strike]]\n* [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]]\n* [[Max (cigarette)|Max]]\n* [[Mayfair (cigarette)|Mayfair]]\n* [[Merit (cigarette)|Merit]]\n* [[Mild Seven]]\n* [[More (cigarette)|More]]\n* [[Nat Sherman]]\n* [[Natural American Spirit]]\n* [[Newport (cigarette)|Newport]]\n* [[Next (cigarette)|Next]]\n* [[Nil (cigarette)|Nil]]\n* [[Old Gold (cigarette)|Old Gold]]\n* [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Mall]]\n* [[Parliament (cigarette)|Parliament]]\n* [[Perilly's]]\n* [[Peter Stuyvesant (cigarette)|Peter Stuyvesant]]\n* [[Imperial Tobacco|Peter Jackson]]\n* [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]]\n* [[Pyramid (cigarette)|Pyramid]]\n* [[John Player & Sons|Player's]]\n* [[Prince (cigarette)|Prince]]\n* Raleigh\n* Ronhill\n* [[Salem (cigarette)|Salem]]\n* [[Sampoerna]]\n* [[Seneca (cigarette)|Seneca]]\n* [[Senior Service (cigarette)|Senior Service]]\n* Smokin Joes\n* [[Sobranie]]\n* Sovereign\n* Sterling\n* [[Surya]]\n* [[Tareyton]]\n* [[Vantage (cigarette)|Vantage]]\n* [[Viceroy (cigarette)|Viceroy]]\n* [[Virginia Slims]]\n* [[West (cigarette)|West]]\n* [[Woodbine (cigarette)|Woodbine]]\n* Windsor Blue\n* [[Winfield (cigarette)|Winfield]]\n* [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Gateway theory ==\n\nA very strong argument can be made about the association between adolescent exposure to nicotine by smoking conventional cigarettes and the subsequent onset of using other dependence-producing substances.{{sfn|SGUS|2016|p=106;

Chapter 3}} Although factors such as genetic comorbidity, innate propensity for risk taking, and social influences may underlie these findings, both human neuroimaging and animal studies suggest a neurobiological mechanism also plays a role.{{sfn|SGUS|2016|p=106; Chapter 3}} In addition, behavioral studies in adolescent and young adult smokers have revealed an increased propensity for risk taking, both generally and in the presence of peers, and neuroimaging studies have shown altered frontal neural activation during a risk-taking task as compared with nonsmokers.{{sfn|SGUS|2016|p=106; Chapter 3}} In 2011, Rubinstein and colleagues used neuroimaging to show decreased brain response to a natural reinforcer (pleasurable food cues) in adolescent light smokers (1\u20135 cigarettes per day), with their results highlighting the possibility of neural alterations consistent with nicotine dependence and altered brain response to reward even in adolescent low-level smokers.{{sfn|SGUS|2016|p=106;

An acetate is a negative ion with the chemical formula of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>.  Deacetylation can be performed by either chemical hydrolysis or [[acetylesterase]].  Chemical hydrolysis is the cleavage of a chemical bond by addition of water.  In the reaction, water (H<sub>2</sub>O) reacts with the [[ethyl acetate|acetic ester]] functional group attached the cellulose polymer chain and forms an [[alcohol]] and [[acetate]].  The alcohol is simply the cellulose polymer chain with the acetate replaced with an alcohol group. The second reaction is exactly the same as chemical hydrolysis with the exception of the use of an [[acetylesterase]] enzyme.  The enzyme, found in most plants, [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the [[chemical reaction]] shown below.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Acetylesterase-mediated deacetylation of pectin impairs cell elongation, pollen germination, and plant reproduction |date=January 2012 |pmid=22247250|doi=10.1105/tpc.111.092411|volume=24|issue=1|pmc=3289554|journal=Plant Cell|pages=50\u201365 | last1 = Gou | first1 = JY | last2 = Miller | first2 = LM | last3 = Hou | first3 = G | last4 = Yu | first4 = XH | last5 = Chen | first5 = XY | last6 = Liu | first6 = CJ}}{{dead link|date=July 2015}}</ref>\n:acetic ester + H<sub>2</sub>O  {{eqm}} alcohol + acetate\nIn the case of the enzymatic reaction, the two substrates (reactants) are again [[acetic ester]] and H<sub>2</sub>O, the two [[product (chemistry)|products]] of the reaction are [[alcohol]] and [[acetate]].  This reaction is exactly the same as the chemical hydrolysis.  Both of these products are perfectly fine in the environment. Once the acetate group is removed from the cellulose chain, the polymer can be readily degraded by [[cellulase]], which is another enzyme found in [[fungus|fungi]], [[bacteria]], and [[protozoa]]ns. Cellulases break down the cellulose molecule into monosaccharides (\"simple sugars\") such as beta-[[glucose]], or shorter [[polysaccharide]]s and [[oligosaccharide]]s. [[File:Cellulos to glycose.png|thumb|400 px|The chemical structure change of cellulose into glucose]]These simple sugars are not harmful to the environment and are in fact are a useful product for many plants and animals.  The breakdown of cellulose is of interest in the field of biofuel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/jin2/|title=Breaking Down Cellulose|website=large.stanford.edu}}</ref> Due to the conditions that affect the process, large variation in the degradation time of cellulose acetate occurs.\n\n=== Factors in biodegradation ===\nThe duration of the biodegradation process is cited as taking as little as one month<ref name=bat/> to as long as 15 years or more, depending on the environmental conditions. The major factor that affects the biodegradation duration is the availability of acetylesterase and cellulase enzymes.  Without these enzymes, biodegradation only occurs through chemical hydrolysis and stops there.  Temperature is another major factor, if the organisms that contain the enzymes are too cold to grow, then biodegradation is severely hindered.  Availability of oxygen in the environment also affects the degradation.  Cellulose acetate is degraded within 2\u20133 weeks under [[Aerobic respiration|aerobic]] assay systems of ''[[in vitro]]'' enrichment cultivation techniques and an activated sludge wastewater treatment system.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Buchanan CM, Garder RM, Komarek RJ |title=Aerobic biodegradation of cellulose acetate |journal=Journal of Applied Polymer Science |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=1709\u20131719 |date=1993 |doi=10.1002/app.1993.070471001}}</ref> It is degraded within 14 weeks under [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] conditions of incubation with special cultures of fungi.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Rivard CJ, Adney WS, Himmel ME, Mitchell DJ, Vinzant TB, Grohmann K, Moens L, Chum H |title=Effects of Natural Polymer Acetlation on the anaerobic Dioconversion to Methane and Carbon Dioxide |journal=Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology |volume=34/35 |pages=725\u2013736 |date=1992 |doi=10.1007/bf02920592|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1232570 }}</ref> Ideal conditions were used for the degradation (i.e. right temperature, and available organisms to provide the enzymes).  Thus, filters last longer in places with low oxygen concentration (ex. swamps and bogs).  Overall, the biodegraditon process of cellulose acetate is not an instantaneous process.\n\n=== Photodegradation ===\nThe other process of degradation is [[photodegradation]], which is when a molecular bond is broken by the absorption of photon radiation (i.e. light).  Due to cellulose acetate carbonyl groups, the molecule naturally absorbs light at 260&nbsp;nm,<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Hon NS |title=Photodegradation of Cellulose Acetate Fibers |journal=Journal of Polymer Science Part A: Polymer Chemistry |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=725\u2013744 |date=1977 |doi=10.1002/pol.1977.170150319|bibcode=1977JPoSA..15..725H }}</ref> but it contains some impurities which can absorb light.

Thus, the primary photodegradation of cellulose acetate is considered insignificant to the total degradation process, since cellulose acetate and its impurities absorb light at shorter wavelengths.  Research is focused on the secondary mechanisms of photodegradation of cellulose acetate to help make up for some of the limitations of biodegradation.  The secondary mechanisms would be the addition of a compound to the filters that would be able to absorb natural light and use it to start the degradation process.  The main two areas of research are in photocatalytic oxidation<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allergyclean.com/news/uvpcoformaldehyde.htm |title=Study on Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO) Raises Questions About Formaldehyde as a Byproduct in Indoor Air |accessdate=30 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426065810/http://allergyclean.com/news/uvpcoformaldehyde.htm |archivedate=26 April 2015 }}</ref> and photosensitized degradation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/458153/photosensitization|title=photosensitization - chemistry|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref> Photocatalytic oxidation uses a species that absorbs radiation and creates hydroxyl radicals that react with the filters and start the breakdown.  Photosensitized degradation, though, uses a species that absorbs radiation and transfers the energy to the cellulose acetate to start the degradation process. Both processes use other species that absorbed light > 300&nbsp;nm to start the degradation of cellulose acetate.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n=== Solution and remediation projects ===\n[[File:Buttout.jpg|thumb|right|A cigarette disposal canister, encouraging the public to dispose of their cigarettes properly]]\nSeveral options are available to help reduce the environmental impact of cigarette butts.  Proper disposal into receptacles leads to decreased numbers found in the environment and their effect on the environment.  Another method is making fines and penalties for littering filters; many governments have sanctioned stiff penalties for littering of cigarette filters; for example, [[Washington (state)|Washington]]  imposes a penalty of $1,025 for littering cigarette filters.<ref>{{cite web\n |date = 2004-06-01\n |url              = http://www.ecy.wa.gov/news/2004news/2004-097.html\n |publisher        = State of Washington Department of Ecology\n |location         = Washington\n |title            = Accidents, fires: Price of littering goes beyond fines\n |access-date      = 2009-05-06\n |archive-url      = https://web.archive.org/web/20091012100713/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/news/2004news/2004-097.html\n |archive-date     = 2009-10-12\n |url-status         = dead\n}}</ref> Another option is developing better biodegradable filters; much of this work relies heavily on the research in the secondary mechanism for photodegradation as stated above, but a new research group has developed an acid tablet that goes inside the filters, and once wet enough, releases acid that speeds up the degradation to around two weeks.<ref>{{cite web | date = 2012-08-14|url = http://www.environmentalhealthnews.org/ehs/newscience/2012/06/2012-0725-biodegradable-cigarette-filters | title = No more butts: biodegradable filters a step to boot litter problem | publisher = Environmental Health News}}</ref>  The research is still only in test phase and the hope is soon it will go into production. The next option is using cigarette packs with a compartment in which to discard cigarette butts, implementing monetary deposits on filters, increasing the availability of butt receptacles, and expanding public education.

The significant reductions in smoking rates in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, and other countries that implemented strong tobacco control programs{{According to whom|date=December 2019}} have been offset by the increasing consumption in low income countries, especially China. The Chinese market now consumes more cigarettes than all other low- and middle-income countries combined.\n\nOther regions are increasingly playing larger roles in the growing global smoking epidemic. The WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO) now has the highest growth rate in the cigarette market, with more than a one-third increase in cigarette consumption since 2000. Due to its recent dynamic economic development and continued population growth, Africa presents the greatest risk in terms of future growth in tobacco use.\n\nWithin countries, patterns of cigarette consumption also can vary widely.\u00a0 For example, in many of the countries where few women smoke, smoking rates are often high in males (e.g., in Asia). By contrast, in most developed countries, female smoking rates are typically only a few percentage points below those of males. In many high and middle income countries lower socioeconomic status is a strong predictor of smoking.\u00a0\n\nSmoking rates in the United States have dropped by more than half from 1965 to 2016, falling from 42% to 15.5% of US adults.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alliedpay.com/high-risk-payment-processing/tobacco-merchant-account-services|title=Tobacco Merchant Account|date=2019-05-21|website=Allied Payments|access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref> Australia is cutting their overall smoking consumption faster than most of the developed world, in part due to landmark Plain Packaging Act, which standardized the appearance of cigarette packs.

Chapter 3}} Adolescent smokers of conventional cigarettes have disproportionately high rates of comorbid substance abuse, and longitudinal studies have suggested that early adolescent smoking may be a starting point or \"[[Gateway drug theory|gateway]]\" for substance abuse later in life, with this effect more likely for persons with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).{{sfn|SGUS|2016|p=106; Chapter 3}} Although factors such as genetic comorbidity, innate propensity for risk taking, and social influences may underlie these findings, both human neuroimaging and animal studies suggest a neurobiological mechanism also plays a role.{{sfn|SGUS|2016|p=106; Chapter 3}} In addition, behavioral studies in adolescent and young adult smokers have revealed an increased propensity for risk taking, both generally and in the presence of peers, and neuroimaging studies have shown altered frontal neural activation during a risk-taking task as compared with nonsmokers.{{sfn|SGUS|2016|p=106; Chapter 3}} In 2011, Rubinstein and colleagues used neuroimaging to show decreased brain response to a natural reinforcer (pleasurable food cues) in adolescent light smokers (1\u20135 cigarettes per day), with their results highlighting the possibility of neural alterations consistent with nicotine dependence and altered brain response to reward even in adolescent low-level smokers.{{sfn|SGUS|2016|p=106;

He also reported the results of surgical drainage of empyemas. [[Maimonides]] (1135\u20131204 AD) observed: \"The basic symptoms that occur in pneumonia and that are never lacking are as follows: acute fever, sticking [[pleuritic]] pain in the side, short rapid breaths, serrated [[pulse]] and cough.\"<ref name=maimo>Maimonides, ''Fusul Musa'' (\"''Pirkei Moshe''\").</ref> This clinical description is quite similar to those found in modern textbooks, and it reflected the extent of medical knowledge through the [[Middle Ages]] into the 19th century.\n\n[[Edwin Klebs]] was the first to observe bacteria in the airways of persons having died of pneumonia in 1875.<ref name=klebs>{{cite journal |author=Klebs E |title=''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntniss der pathogenen Schistomyceten''.

Friedl\u00e4nder's initial work introduced the [[Gram staining|Gram stain]], a fundamental laboratory test still used today to identify and categorize bacteria.

With the advent of [[penicillin]] and other antibiotics, modern surgical techniques, and intensive care in the 20th century, mortality from pneumonia, which had approached 30%, dropped precipitously in the developed world.
