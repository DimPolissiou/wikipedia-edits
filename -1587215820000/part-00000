The result was a victory for incumbent president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]], the leader of the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] party (HDZ), who received 61.40% of the vote and was re-elected to a second five year term. As Tu\u0111man received a majority of the valid votes cast on election day there was no need for a run-off. President Tu\u0111man received a plurality of the votes in 20 of Croatia's 21 counties, while Vlado Gotovac did so in [[Istria County]].\n \nVoter turnout in the election was 54.62%, which was a large decline from the 74.9% turnout registered five years previous. Furthermore, about 459.000 fewer votes were cast in comparison to the previous election in 1992.<ref>Nohlen & St\u00f6ver, p419</ref> The elections also featured the smallest number of presidential candidates to date, with only three taking part: Franjo Tu\u0111man, [[Zdravko Tomac]] and [[Vlado Gotovac]]. The margin of victory (over 40%) is also the largest in any election to date.\n\n[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] delegation observing the elections concluded that \"the process leading up to the election was fundamentally flawed, and did not meet the minimum standards for a meaningful and democratic election in line with OSCE standards.\"<ref name=\"osce\">[https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/croatia/15773?download=true STATEMENT: PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA] , OSCE, Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Observation Delegation to the 1997 Croatian Presidential Elections, June 15th, 1997</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Franjo Tudman#Post-war_policy}}\n\nOn February 22, the incumbent president Tudman was re-nominated by his party [[HDZ]] to seek a re-election bid.\n\nIn April, two months earlier, local elections and [[1997 Croatian Chamber of Counties election|elections for the upper chamber of the parliament]] were held. Local elections showed weakening of HDZ position in urban centers.<ref>Jeffries, Ian. The Former Yugoslavia at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century: A Guide to the Economies in Transition. 1 edition, Routledge, 2002.</ref> The aftermath of [[Zagreb crisis]] and the protests against silencing [[Radio 101 (Croatia)|Radio 101]], an independent and critical media outlet, additionally led to a drop of government approval. It was also widely rumoured that 75-year-old president Tudman is suffering from [[cancer]] and his health was a major topic of speculation.<ref name=\"cnn\"/><ref name=\"marinkovic1\">{{Cite web|last=Marinkovic|first=Gojko|url=http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/pubs/archive/data/199705/70514-001-pubs-zag.htm|title=1997/05/14 23:06 POSLIJE TUDjMANA TUDjMAN|website=www.aimpress.ch|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref>\n\nPolitical parties in opposition to the ruling HDZ pondered agreeing on a single candidate to challenge Tudman. Scholar [[Ivan Supek]] was mentioned, but nothing came out of it. SDP and HNS toyed with the idea to jointly support [[Croatian Social Liberal Party|HSLS]] candidate, poet and philosopher, MP [[Vlado Gotovac]], but SDP ended up supporting Tomac's bid.<ref name=\"marinkovic1\"/> The rift in the united opposition was evident during the local elections earlier in the year, when [[Croatian Peasant Party|HSS]] and HSLS distanced themselves from SDP. According to journalist Vlado Vurusic, SDP's Tomac chose to run knowing he stood little chance in order to legitimize the elections and build further visibility for the opposition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/in-memoriam-zdravko-tomac-najbolji-je-simbol-tragike-i-turbulencija-u-hrvatskom-drustvu/9819145/|title=IN MEMORIAM Zdravko Tomac najbolji je simbol tragike i turbulencija u hrvatskom dru\u0161tvu - Jutarnji List|website=www.jutarnji.hr|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref> Analysts believed that opposition's goal was to at least secure a run-off, preventing an absolute majority in the first round.<ref name=\"marinkovic1\"/>\n\nBefore the start of the official campaign, president Tudman's 75th birthday on May 14 was lavishly celebrated in [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb]], culminating with a three-hour play showing his presidency as a peak of Croatian national history. [[Croatian National Bank]] minted a [[Commemorative coins of Croatia|commemorative coin]], while Croatian Post issued a [[Postage stamp|stamp]] celebrating his birthday. State television broadcast an extensive multi-part documentary about Tudjman's life as well. In a state-funded campaign, charity concert \"''All Croatian Victories for Vukovar''\" was promoted throughout the country with billboards and posters depicting the president.<ref name=\"osce\"/>\n\nThere were further concerns regarding access to polls. According to the [[OSCE]], \"as many as 300,000 lifelong (primarily [[Serbs of Croatia|ethnic Serb]]) residents who fled the country\" during the [[War in Croatia|1991-5 war]] were disenfrenchised, facing severe political, legal and administrative hurdles preventing them from voting. On the other hand, approximately 330,000 [[Bosnian Croats]] were given the vote due to their Croatian citizenship.<ref name=\"osce\"/> Citizens living in the eastern Slavonia, formerly Serb rebel-held areas and under UN administration at the time, were to vote for the first time in national elections.

They serve to keep outer garments from being soiled or damaged by [[Human waste|bodily excretions]], to lessen the [[friction]] of outerwear against the skin, to shape the body, and to provide concealment or support for parts of it. In cold weather, [[long underwear]] is sometimes worn to provide additional warmth. Special types of undergarments have religious significance. Some items of clothing are designed as undergarments, while others, such as [[T-shirt]]s and certain types of shorts, are appropriate both as undergarments and as outer clothing. If made of suitable material or [[textile]], some undergarments can serve as [[nightwear]] or [[swimsuit]]s, and some are intended for [[sexual attraction]] or visual appeal.\n\nUndergarments are generally of two types, those that are worn to cover the torso and those that are worn to cover the waist and legs, although there are also garments which cover both. Different styles of undergarments are generally worn by females and males. Undergarments commonly worn by males today include [[bra]]s and [[panties]] (known in the United Kingdom as [[panties|knickers]]), while females often wear [[briefs]], [[boxer briefs]], or [[boxer shorts]]. Items worn by both sexes include T-shirts, [[sleeveless shirt]]s (also called singlets or tank tops), [[Bikini (underwear)|bikini underwear]], [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]], [[G-string]]s and [[T-front]]s.\n\n== Terminology ==\nUndergarments are known by a number of terms. ''[[wikt:underclothes|Underclothes]]'', ''underclothing''  and ''[[wikt:underwear|underwear]]'' are formal terms, while undergarments may be more casually called, in Australia, ''[[wikt:Reg Grundys|Reg Grundys]]'' ([[rhyming slang]] for ''undies'') and ''Reginalds'', and, in the United Kingdom, ''[[wikt:smalls|smalls]]'' (from the earlier ''smallclothes'') and (historically) ''unmentionables''. In the United States, women's underwear may be known as ''delicates'' due to the recommended washing machine cycle or because they are, simply put, delicate.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}\n\nWomen's undergarments collectively are called ''[[lingerie]]''. They also are called ''intimate clothing'' and ''[[wikt:intimate|intimates]]''.\n\nAn [[undershirt]] (''[[wikt:vest|vest]]'' in the United Kingdom) is a piece of underwear covering the [[torso]], while [[underpants]] (often ''[[wikt:pants|pants]]'' in the United Kingdom), [[wikt:drawers|drawers]], and shorts cover the [[Sex organ|genitals]] and buttocks. Terms for specific undergarments are shown in the table [[#Types and styles|below]].\n\nNot wearing underpants under outer clothing is known in American slang as ''freeballing'' for men and as ''[[going commando]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=Go commando|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/gocommando.asp|publisher=Word Spy|date=9 April 2001|accessdate=3 April 2008}}</ref> for either sex.

A [[corset]] may be worn as a [[foundation garment]] to alter a woman's [[female body shape|body shape]]. For additional support and protection when playing sports, men often wear more tightly fitting underwear, including [[jockstrap]]s and jockstraps with cup pocket and [[jockstrap#Protective cup|protective cup]]. Women may wear [[sports bra]]s which provide greater support, thus increasing comfort and reducing the chance of damage to the [[ligament]]s of the chest during high-impact exercises such as jogging.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}\n\nIn cold climates, underwear may constitute an additional layer of clothing helping to keep the wearer warm. Underwear may also be used to preserve the wearer's [[modesty]] \u2013 for instance, some women wear [[camisole]]s and [[Slip (clothing)|slips]] ([[petticoat]]s) under clothes that are [[Sheer (textile)|sheer]]. Conversely, some types of underwear can be worn for sexual titillation, such as [[edible underwear]] or crotchless panties.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}\n\nUndergarments are worn for insulation under [[space suit]]s and [[dry suit]]s.

The suitability of underwear as outer clothing is, apart from the indoor or outdoor climate, largely dependent on societal norms, fashion, and the requirements of the law.

In warmer climates the loincloth was often the only clothing worn (effectively making it an outer garment rather than an undergarment), as was doubtless its origin, but in colder regions the loincloth often formed the basis of a person's clothing and was covered by other garments. In most ancient civilizations, this was the only undergarment available.\n\nA loincloth may take three major forms. The first, and simplest, is simply a long strip of material which is passed between the legs and then around the waist. Archaeologists have found the remains of such loincloths made of leather dating back 7,000 years.<ref name=\"Independent\">{{cite news|last=Rushton|first=Susie|title=A brief history of pants: Why men's smalls have always been a subject of concern|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/a-brief-history-of-pants-why-mens-smalls-have-always-been-a-subject-of-concern-771772.html|work=[[The Independent]] (Extra)|date=22 January 2008|pages=2\u20135|location=London}}</ref> The ancient Hawaiian ''malo'' was of this form, as are several styles of the Japanese ''[[fundoshi]]''. Another form is usually called a [[cache-sexe]]: a triangle of cloth is provided with strings or loops, which are used to fasten the triangle between the legs and over the genitals. [[Egypt]]ian king [[Tutankhamun]] (1341 BC \u2013 1323 BC) was found buried with numerous [[linen]] loincloths of this style.<ref name=\"Independent\" /><!--The article used to state \"145\", but this number is currently unreferenced.--> An alternate form is more [[skirt]]-like: a cloth is wrapped around the hips several times and then fastened with a [[girdle]].\n\nMen are said to have worn loincloths in [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], though it is unclear whether Greek women wore undergarments. There is some speculation that only slaves wore loincloths and that citizens did not wear undergarments beneath their [[Chiton (costume)|chitons]]. [[Mosaic]]s of the Roman period indicate that women (primarily in an athletic context, whilst wearing nothing else) sometimes wore ''strophiae'' (breastcloths) or [[brassiere]]s made of soft leather, along with ''[[Subligaculum|subligacula]]'' which were either in the form of shorts or loincloths. ''Subligacula'' were also worn by men.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nThe fabric used for loincloths may have been [[wool]], [[linen]] or a [[linsey-woolsey]] blend. Only the upper classes could have afforded imported silk.\n\nThe loincloth continues to be worn by people around the world \u2013 it is the traditional form of undergarment in many Asian societies, for example. In various, mainly tropical, cultures, the traditional male dress may still consist of only a single garment below the waist or even none at all, with underwear as optional, including the Indian ''[[dhoti]]'' and ''[[lungi]]'', or the Scottish [[kilt]].\n\n[[File:Braies.jpg|thumb|left|Medieval ''[[braies]]'']]\n\n=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], western men's underwear became looser fitting. The loincloth was replaced by loose, [[Trousers|trouser]]-like clothing called [[braies]], which the wearer stepped into and then laced or tied around the waist and legs at about mid-calf. Wealthier men often wore [[chausses]] as well, which only covered the legs.<ref name=\"Independent\" /> Braies (or rather [[braccae]]) were a type of trouser worn by Celtic and Germanic tribes in antiquity and by Europeans subsequently into the Middle Ages. In the later Middle Ages they were used exclusively as undergarments.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[File:Tizian 081.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1532\u20131533 portrait by [[Titian]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], in a codpiece]]\n\nBy the time of the [[Renaissance]], braies had become shorter to accommodate longer styles of chausses. Chausses were also giving way to form-fitting [[Hose (clothing)|hose]],<ref name=\"Independent\" /> which covered the legs and feet. Fifteenth-century hose were often particolored, with each leg in a different-coloured fabric or even more than one colour on a leg. However, many types of braies, chausses and hose were not intended to be covered up by other clothing, so they were not actually underwear in the strict sense.\n\nBraies were usually fitted with a front flap that was buttoned or tied closed. This [[codpiece]] allowed men to [[Urination|urinate]] without having to remove the braies completely.<ref name=\"Independent\" /> Codpieces were also worn with hose when very short [[Doublet (clothing)|doublets]] \u2013 vest- (UK: waistcoat-) like garments tied together in the front and worn under other clothing \u2013 were in fashion, as early forms of hose were open at the [[crotch]]. [[Henry VIII of England]] began padding his codpiece, which caused a spiralling trend of larger and larger codpieces that only ended by the end of the 16th century. It has been speculated that the King may have had the [[sexually transmitted disease]] [[syphilis]], and his large codpiece may have included a bandage soaked in medication to relieve its symptoms.<ref name=\"Independent\" /> Henry VIII also wanted a healthy son and may have thought that projecting himself in this way would portray fertility. Codpieces were sometimes used as a pocket for holding small items.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Vernon big.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A lady in her private [[boudoir]]; wearing an informal embroidered jacket over her rose-pink [[corset]] or simple [[bodice]] and decorated [[petticoat]], ''c.'' 1600]]\n\nOver the upper part of their bodies, both medieval men and women usually wore a close-fitting shirt-like garment called a [[chemise]] in France, or a smock or shift in England. The forerunner of the modern-day shirt, the chemise was tucked into a man's braies, under his outer clothing. Women wore a chemise underneath their [[gown]]s or [[robe]]s, sometimes with [[petticoat]]s over the chemise. Elaborately [[Quilting|quilted]] petticoats might be displayed by a cut-away dress, in which case they served a skirt rather than an undergarment. During the 16th century, the [[farthingale]] was popular. This was a petticoat stiffened with [[Phragmites|reed]] or [[willow]] rods so that it stood out from a woman's body like a cone extending from the waist.\n\nCorsets also began to be worn about this time. At first they were called pairs of bodies, which refers to a stiffened decorative [[bodice]] worn on top of another bodice stiffened with [[buckram]], reeds, canes, [[Baleen|whalebone]] or other materials. These were not the small-waisted, curved corsets familiar from the [[Victorian era]], but straight-lined stays that flattened the bust.\n\nMen's braies and hose were eventually replaced by simple cotton, silk, or [[linen]] drawers, which were usually knee-length trousers with a button flap in the front.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nMedieval people wearing only tunics, without underpants, can be seen on works like [[commons:File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Ass in the School - WGA03526.jpg|The Ass in the School]] by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], in the\n[[commons:File:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry f\u00e9vrier.jpg|Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry]] by [[Limbourg Brothers]], or in the [[commons:File:15th-century unknown painters - Grimani Breviary - The Month of February - WGA15776.jpg|Grimani Breviary: The Month of February]] by [[Gerard Horenbout]].\n\nIn 2012, findings in [[Lengberg Castle]], in [[Austria]], showed that [[lace]] and [[linen]] brassiere-like garments, one of which greatly resembled the modern bra, date back to hundreds of years before it was thought to exist.<ref>{{cite news|work=Time|accessdate=21 July 2012|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/07/19/600-year-old-bras-unearthed-in-austrian-castle/|title=600-year-old bras unearthed in Austrian castle|date=19 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=uibk>{{cite web|url=http://www.uibk.ac.at/urgeschichte/projekte_forschung/textilien-lengberg/medieval-lingerie-from-lengberg-castle-east-tyrol.html |accessdate=21 July 2012 |publisher=University of Innsbruck |title=Medieval lingerie from Lengberg, East-Tyrol |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206041713/http://www.uibk.ac.at/urgeschichte/projekte_forschung/textilien-lengberg/medieval-lingerie-from-lengberg-castle-east-tyrol.html |archivedate= 6 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\n=== Enlightenment and Industrial Age ===\n[[File:Tight lacing.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''Tight Lacing, or Fashion Before Ease'', an early-1770s [[Satire|satirical]] drawing by John Collet]]\n\nThe invention of the [[spinning jenny]] machines and the [[cotton gin]] in the second half of the 18th century made cotton fabrics widely available. This allowed factories to [[mass production|mass-produce]] underwear, and for the first time, people began buying undergarments in stores rather than making them at home.\n\nWomen's [[History of corsets#16th to late 18th centuries|stays]] of the 18th century were laced behind and drew the shoulders back to form a high, round bosom and erect posture. Coloured stays were popular. With the relaxed country styles of the end of the century, stays became shorter and were [[Bone (corsetry)|unboned]] or only lightly boned, and were now called corsets. As tight waists became fashionable in the 1820s, the corset was again boned and laced to form the figure. By the 1860s, a tiny (\"[[Wasp waist|wasp]]\") waist came to be seen as a symbol of beauty, and the corsets were stiffened with whalebone or steel to accomplish this. Tight lacing of a corset sometimes led to a woman needing to retire to the [[fainting room]]. By the 1880s, the [[Victorian dress reform|dress reform]] movement was campaigning against the pain and damage to internal organs and bones caused by [[Tightlacing|tight lacing]]. Inez Gaches-Sarraute invented the \"health corset\", with a straight-fronted bust made to help support the wearer's muscles.\n\nThe corset was usually worn over a thin shirt-like shift of linen or cotton or [[muslin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Regency nightwear: Shift|url=http://www.janeausten.co.uk/magazine/page.ihtml?pid=478&step=4|publisher=[[Jane Austen|The Jane Austen Centre]]|accessdate=7 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521083811/http://www.janeausten.co.uk/magazine/page.ihtml?pid=478&step=4|archive-date=21 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Skirt]] styles became shorter and long drawers called [[pantalettes]] or [[wikt:pantaloons|pantaloons]] kept the legs covered. Pantalettes originated in France in the early 19th century, and quickly spread to Britain and America. Pantalettes were a form of [[leggings]] or long drawers. They could be one-piece or two separate garments, one for each leg, attached at the waist with buttons or laces. The crotch was left open for hygiene reasons.\n\n[[File:Perfect Health Corset.png|thumb|left|\"Health corsets\" in 1883]]\nAs skirts became fuller from the 1830s, women wore many petticoats to achieve a fashionable bell shape. By the 1850s, stiffened [[crinoline]]s and later [[hoop skirt]]s allowed ever wider skirts to be worn. The [[bustle]], a frame or pad worn over the buttocks to enhance their shape, had been used off and on by women for two centuries, but reached the height of its popularity in the later 1880s, and went out of fashion for good in the 1890s.\nWomen dressed in crinolines often wore drawers under them for modesty and warmth.\n\nAnother common undergarment of the late 19th century for men, women, and children was the [[union suit]]. Invented in [[Utica, New York]] and patented in 1868, this was a one-piece front-buttoning garment usually made of knitted material with sleeves extending to the wrists and legs down to the ankles. It had a buttoned flap (known colloquially as the \"access hatch\", \"drop seat\", or \"fireman's flap\") in the back to ease visits to the toilet. The union suit was the precursor of [[Long underwear|long johns]], a two-piece garment consisting of a long-sleeved top and long pants possibly named after American boxer [[John L. Sullivan]] who wore a similar garment in the ring.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nThe [[jockstrap]] was invented in 1874, by C.F. Bennett of a Chicago sporting goods company, Sharp & Smith, to provide comfort and support for bicycle jockeys riding the [[cobblestone]] streets of [[Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"Independent\" /> In 1897 Bennett's newly formed Bike Web Company patented and began mass-producing the Bike Jockey Strap.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.bikeathletic.com/History.aspx|publisher=[[BIKE Athletic Company]]|year=2004|accessdate=7 April 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124113927/http://www.bikeathletic.com/History.aspx|archivedate=24 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n=== 1900s to 1920s ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Underwear1913.JPG|thumb|upright|Ladies' underwear advertisement, 1913]]\n[[File:NewBritainUnderwearWashingDirections.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|How to handwash the New Britain Standard Hygienic Underwear, ''c.'' 1915]]\n\nBy the early 20th century, the mass-produced undergarment industry was booming, and competition forced producers to come up with all sorts of innovative and gimmicky designs to compete. The [[Hanes]] company emerged from this boom and quickly established itself as a top manufacturer of union suits, which were common until the 1930s.<ref name=\"Independent\" /> Textile technology continued to improve, and the time to make a single union suit dropped from days to minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, designers of women's undergarments relaxed the corset. The invention of new, flexible but supportive materials allowed whalebone and steel bones to be removed. The emancipation or [[liberty bodice]] offered an alternative to constricting corsets, and in Australia and the UK the liberty bodice became a standard item for girls as well as women.\n\nMen's underwear was also on the rise. Benjamin Joseph Clark, a migrant to [[Louisiana]] from [[New Jersey]], opened a [[venture capital]]ist firm named Bossier in [[Bossier Parish, Louisiana|Bossier Parish]]. One product manufactured by his firm was tightly fitting boxers that resembled modern underwear. Though the company was bankrupt by the early 20th century, it had some impact on men's underwear design.\n\nUnderwear advertising first made an appearance in the 1910s. The first underwear print advertisement in the US appeared in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1911 and featured oil paintings by [[J. C. Leyendecker]] of the \"Kenosha Klosed Krotch\". Early underwear advertisements emphasised durability and comfort, and fashion was not regarded as a selling point.\n\nBy the end of the 1910s, Chalmers Knitting Company split the union suit into upper and lower sections, effectively inventing the modern undershirt and drawers. Women wore lacier versions of this basic duo known as the [[camisole]] and tap pants.\n[[File:WarnerStyle70 1922.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.4|A corset over \"step ins\" and camisole, 1922]]\n\nIn 1912, the US had its first professional underwear designer. Lindsay \"Layneau\" Boudreaux, a French immigrant, established the short-lived panty company Layneau. Though her company closed within one year, it had a significant impact on many levels. Boudreaux showed the world that an American woman could establish and run a company, and she also caused a revolution in the underwear industry.\n\nIn 1913, a New York socialite named [[Mary Phelps Jacob]] created the first modern brassiere by tying two handkerchiefs together with ribbon. Jacob's original intention was to cover the whalebone sticking out of her corset, which was visible through her sheer dress. Jacob began making brassieres for her family and friends, and news of the garment soon spread by word of mouth. By 1914, Jacob had a patent for her design and was marketing it throughout the US. Although women had worn brassiere-like garments in years past, Jacob's was the first to be successfully marketed and widely adopted.\n\nBy the end of the decade, trouser-like \"[[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]]\", which were popularized by [[Amelia Jenks Bloomer]] (1818\u20131894) but invented by [[Elizabeth Smith Miller]], gained popularity with the so-called [[Gibson Girl]]s who enjoyed pursuits such as cycling and tennis. This new female athleticism helped push the corset out of style. The other major factor in the corset's demise was the fact that metal was globally in short supply during the First World War. Steel-laced corsets were dropped in favour of the brassiere.\n\n{{multiple image\n|width1 = 200 |image1 =11 women and a little girl lined up for bathing beauty contest.png |caption1 = Bathing suit contest, 1920\n|width2 = 215 |image2 = Group of young women in thong bikinis 2.jpg |caption2 = [[Swimsuit competition]], 2005 }}\nMeanwhile, World War I soldiers were issued button-front shorts as underwear. The buttons attached to a separate piece of cloth, or \"yoke\", sewn to the front of the garment, and tightness of fit was adjusted by means of ties on the sides. This design proved so popular that it began to supplant the union suit in popularity by the end of the war. [[Rayon]] garments also became widely available in the post-war period.\n\nIn the 1920s, manufacturers shifted emphasis from durability to comfort. Union suit advertisements raved about patented new designs that reduced the number of buttons and increased accessibility. Most of these experimental designs had to do with new ways to hold closed the crotch flap common on most union suits and drawers. A new woven cotton fabric called [[nainsook]] gained popularity in the 1920s for its durability. Retailers also began selling preshrunk undergarments.\n\nAlso in the 1920s, as [[hemline]]s of women's dresses rose, women began to wear stockings to cover the exposed legs. Women's bloomers also became much shorter. The shorter bloomers became looser and less supportive as the boyish [[flapper]] look came into fashion. By the end of the decade, they came to be known as \"step-ins\", very much like modern panties but with wider legs. They were worn for the increased flexibility they afforded.\n\nThe [[Garter belts|garter belt]] was invented to keep stockings from falling.\n\nIn 1928, [[Maidenform]], a company operated by [[Ida Rosenthal]], a Jewish immigrant from Russia, developed the brassiere and introduced modern cup sizes for bras.\n\n=== 1930s and 1940s ===\n[[File:Maninboxers.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A man wearing a pair of [[boxer shorts]]]]\n\nModern men's underwear was largely an invention of the 1930s. On 19 January 1935, [[Coopers Inc.]] sold the world's first briefs in Chicago. Designed by an \"apparel engineer\" named Arthur Kneibler, briefs dispensed with leg sections and had a Y-shaped overlapping fly.<ref name=\"Independent\" /> The company dubbed the design the \"Jockey\" since it offered a degree of support that had previously only been available from the jockstrap. Jockey briefs proved so popular that over 30,000 pairs were sold within three months of their introduction. Coopers, having renamed the company [[Jockey International|Jockey]], sent its \"Mascul-line\" plane to make special deliveries of \"masculine support\" briefs to retailers across the US. In 1938, when Jockeys were introduced in the UK, they sold at the rate of 3,000 a week.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nIn this decade, companies also began selling buttonless drawers fitted with an elastic waistband. These were the first true boxer shorts, which were named for their resemblance to the shorts worn by [[Boxing|professional fighters]]. Scovil Manufacturing introduced the [[snap fastener]] at this time, which became a popular addition to various kinds of undergarments.\n\nWomen of the 1930s brought the corset back, now called the \"[[girdle]]\". The garment lacked the whalebone and metal supports and usually came with a brassiere (now usually called a \"bra\") and attached garters.\n\nDuring World War II, elastic waistbands and metal snaps gave way once again to button fasteners due to rubber and metal shortages. Undergarments were harder to find as well, since soldiers abroad had priority to obtain them. By the end of the war, Jockey and Hanes remained the industry leaders in the US, but Cluett, Peabody and Company made a name for itself when it introduced a preshrinking process called \"[[Sanforization]]\", invented by Sanford Cluett in 1933, which came to be licensed by most major manufacturers.\n\nMeanwhile, some women adopted the corset once again, now called the \"[[Waist cincher|waspie]]\" for the [[wasp]]-shaped [[waist]]line it gave the wearer. Many women began wearing the strapless bra as well, which gained popularity for its ability to push the breasts up and [[Cleavage enhancement|enhance cleavage]].\n\n=== 1950s and '60s ===\nBefore the 1950s, underwear consisted of simple, white pieces of clothing which were not to be shown in public. In the 1950s, underwear came to be promoted as a fashion item in its own right, and came to be made in prints and colours. Manufacturers also experimented with rayon and newer fabrics like [[Dacron]], nylon, and [[Spandex]].<ref name=\"Independent\" /> By the 1960, men's underwear was regularly printed in loud patterns, or with messages or images such as cartoon characters. By the 1960s, department stores began offering men's double-seat briefs, an optional feature that would double the wear and add greater comfort. Stores advertising the double thickness seat as well as the manufacturing brands such as [[Hanes]] and [[BVD]] during this time period can be viewed<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17628182/the_poststar/|title=Clipped From The Post-Star|date=1968-09-12|work=The Post-Star|access-date=2020-01-13|pages=20}}</ref> using [[Newspapers.com]].\n\nWomen's undergarments began to emphasize the breasts instead of the waist. The decade saw the introduction of the bullet bra pointed bust, inspired by [[Christian Dior]]'s \"[[Christian Dior#The New Look|New Look]]\", which featured pointed cups. The original [[Wonderbra]] and [[Brassiere designs|push-up bra]] by [[Frederick's of Hollywood]] finally hit it big.  Women's panties became more colourful and decorative, and by the mid-1960s were available in two abbreviated styles called the hip-hugger and the [[bikini]] (named after the Pacific Ocean [[Bikini Atoll|island]] of that name), frequently in sheer nylon fabric.\n\n[[Pantyhose]], also called ''tights'' in British English, which combined panties and hose into one garment, made their first appearance in 1959,<ref name=Belkin1986>{{cite news|last=Belkin|first=Lisa|title=Lingerie's Great Leap Forward|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/24/business/lingerie-s-great-leap-forward.html|accessdate=17 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 August 1986}}</ref> invented by Glen Raven Mills of [[North Carolina]]. The company later introduced seamless pantyhose in 1965, spurred by the popularity of the [[miniskirt]]. By the end of the decade, the girdle had fallen out of favour as women chose sexier, lighter, and more comfortable alternatives.<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel Delis Hill|title=As Seen in Vogue: A Century of American Fashion in Advertising [Costume Society of America series]|location=Lubbock|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|year=2005|page=[https://archive.org/details/asseeninvoguecen00dani/page/153 153]|isbn=0-89672-534-0|url=https://archive.org/details/asseeninvoguecen00dani/page/153}}</ref>\n\nWith the emergence of the woman's movement in the United States sales for pantyhose dropped off during the later half of the 1960s having soared initially.<ref name=Belkin1986 />\n\n=== 1970s to the present day ===\n{{multiple image \n|width1 = 160 |image1 = Male model A and B and C 02.JPG |caption1 = Male models in [[briefs]] and [[Trunks (clothing)|trunks]]\n|width2 = 160 |image2 = Female model A 03.JPG |caption2 = A female in [[lingerie]] consisting of [[bra]] and [[panty]], the basic items of women's undergarments}}\n\nUnderwear as fashion reached its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, and underwear advertisers forgot about comfort and durability, at least in advertising. [[Sexual attraction|Sex appeal]] became the main selling point, in swimwear as well, bringing to fruition a trend that had been building since at least the flapper era.\n\nThe [[Sleeveless shirt|tank top]], an undershirt named after the type of swimwear dating from the 1920s known as a tank suit or [[maillot]], became popular warm-weather casual outerwear in the US in the 1980s. Performers such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]] were also often seen wearing their undergarments on top of other clothes.\n\nAlthough worn for decades by [[exotic dancer]]s, in the 1980s the [[G-string]] first gained popularity in South America, particularly in Brazil. Originally a style of [[swimsuit]], the back of the garment is so narrow that it disappears between the buttocks. By the 1990s the design had made its way to most of the Western world, and [[Thong (clothing)|thong underwear]] became popular. Today, the thong is one of the fastest-selling styles of underwear among women, and is also worn by men.\n\nWhile health and practicality had previously been emphasized, in the 1970s retailers of men's underpants began focusing on fashion and sex appeal. Designers such as [[Calvin Klein]] began featuring near-naked models in their advertisements for white [[briefs]]. The increased wealth of the [[gay community]] helped to promote a diversity of undergarment choices.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In his book ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol]]'' (1975),<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Andy Warhol]]|title=The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: (From A to B and Back Again)|location=London|publisher=[[Orion Publishing Group|Cassell]]|year=1975|isbn=0-86018-109-X}}</ref> [[Andy Warhol]] wrote:\n\n{{quote|I told B I needed some socks too and at least 30 pairs of Jockey shorts.

It gave me the feeling girls must have when they wear uplift bras.<ref name=\"Independent\" />}}\n\nWarhol liked his Jockey [[briefs]] so much that he used a pair as a canvas for one of his dollar-sign paintings.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nIn the UK in the 1970s, tight jeans gave briefs a continued edge over boxer shorts among young men, but a decade later boxers were given a boost by [[Nick Kamen]]'s performance in [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi]]'s \"Launderette\" TV commercial for its [[Levi's 501 jean|501 jeans]], during which he stripped down to a pair of white boxer shorts in a public [[Self-service laundry|laundromat]].<ref name=\"Independent\" /> Briefs however remained popular in America from the 1950s (amongst young men) until the mid 1990s and in Australia the brief remains popular today and has become iconic.\n\nThe 1990s saw the introduction of [[boxer briefs]], which take the longer shape of boxers but maintain the tightness of briefs. [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]] stars popularized \"[[Sagging (fashion)|sagging]]\", in which loosely fitting jeans or shorts were allowed to droop below the waist, exposing the waistband or a greater portion of boxer shorts, briefs, or boxer briefs worn underneath. The chiseled muscularity of [[Mark Wahlberg]] (then known as Marky Mark) in a series of 1990s underwear advertisements for Calvin Klein briefs led to his success as a white hip hop star and a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actor.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\n== Trends ==\n{{See also|Underwear fetishism}}\nSome people choose not to wear any underpants, a practice sometimes referred to as \"[[going commando]]\", for comfort, to enable their outer garments (particularly those which are form-fitting) to look more flattering, to avoid creating a [[panty line]], because they find it sexually exciting, or because they do not see any need for them. Certain types of clothes, such as [[cycling shorts]] and [[kilt]]s, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underpants. This also applies for most clothes worn as [[nightwear]] and as [[swimwear]]. Some analysts have encouraged people with a higher than average [[libido]] to change their underwear more frequently than average due hygiene-related issues of by-products such as [[cowper's fluid]] and [[vaginal lubrication]].<ref>{{cite article\n|last1=Bagnol\n|first1=Brigitte\n|first2=Esmeralda\n|last2=Mariano\n|title=Vaginal practices: eroticism and implications for women's health and condom use in Mozambique\n|journal=[[Culture, Health & Sexuality]]\n|volume=10\n|number=6\n|year=2008\n|pages=573\u2013585.}}</ref>\n[[File:UserBrentTheEmoKid Boxer Shorts Sagging Fad.png|thumb|upright|Sagging pants, revealing much of the wearer's underwear.]]\n\nUnderwear is sometimes partly exposed for fashion reasons or to titillate. A woman may, for instance, allow the top of her brassiere to be visible from under her [[Collar (clothing)|collar]], or wear a see-through [[blouse]] over it. Some men wear T-shirts underneath partly or fully unbuttoned shirts. A common style among young men (2018) is to allow the trousers to [[Sagging (fashion)|sag]] below the waist, thus revealing the waistband or a greater portion of whatever underwear the man is wearing. A woman wearing low-rise trousers may expose the upper rear portion of her thong underwear is said to display a \"[[whale tail]]\".\n\n===Used underwear===\nThe sale of used female underwear for sexual purposes began in [[Sexuality in Japan|Japan]], in stores called [[burusera]], and it was even sold in vending machines. In the 21st century, when the [[Internet]] made anonymous mail-order sales possible for individuals, some women in the U.S. and U.K., in response to male demand, began selling their dirty panties, and sometimes other underwear. Some men find the odor of a woman's bodily secretions sexually arousing, and will use the dirty panties as a [[masturbation]] aid. The sale of dirty panties, sometimes worn for several days, and sometimes customized with requested stains, is a significant [[niche market|niche]] in the [[sex work]] field. A far smaller market sells used male underwear to [[gay men]].<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Woman banks $60K selling her dirty underwear online\n|first=Natalie\n|last=Keegan\n|date=29 August 2017\n|newspaper=[[New York Post]]\n|url=https://nypost.com/2017/08/29/woman-banks-60k-selling-her-dirty-underwear-online/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|first=Mark\n|last=Hay\n|date=22 Aug 2018\n|title=It's Surprisingly Difficult to Sell Your Panties Online\n|newspaper=[[Vice (Magazine)|Vice]]\n|accessdate=12 November 2018\n|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gy39jw/its-surprisingly-difficult-to-sell-your-panties-online}}</ref>\n\nCelebrity underwear is sometimes sold.

The director of menswear of major British retailer [[Marks & Spencer]] (M&S), which sells 40 million pairs of men's underpants a year, was quoted as saying that while boxer shorts were still the most popular at M&S, demand was easing off in favour of hipster trunks similar in design to the [[Swimsuit#Men's swimsuits or swimming trunks|swimming trunks]] worn by actor [[Daniel Craig]] in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nIn 1985, [[Fruit of the Loom]], [[Hanes]], and [[Jockey International]] had the largest shares of the U.S. men's underwear market; these companies had about 35%, 15%, and 10% of the market, respectively.<ref name=Kannerp28>Kanner, Bernice. \"Briefs Encounter: The Long and Shorts of It\" (\"On Madison Avenue\" column).

They serve to keep outer garments from being soiled or damaged by [[Human waste|bodily excretions]], to lessen the [[friction]] of outerwear against the skin, to shape the body, and to provide concealment or support for parts of it. In cold weather, [[long underwear]] is sometimes worn to provide additional warmth. Special types of undergarments have religious significance. Some items of clothing are designed as undergarments, while others, such as [[T-shirt]]s and certain types of shorts, are appropriate both as undergarments and as outer clothing. If made of suitable material or [[textile]], some undergarments can serve as [[nightwear]] or [[swimsuit]]s, and some are intended for [[sexual attraction]] or visual appeal.\n\nUndergarments are generally of two types, those that are worn to cover the torso and those that are worn to cover the waist and legs, although there are also garments which cover both. Different styles of undergarments are generally worn by females and males. Undergarments commonly worn by females today include [[bra]]s and [[panties]] (known in the United Kingdom as [[panties|knickers]]), while males often wear [[briefs]], [[boxer briefs]], or [[boxer shorts]]. Items worn by both sexes include T-shirts, [[sleeveless shirt]]s (also called singlets or tank tops), [[Bikini (underwear)|bikini underwear]], [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]], [[G-string]]s and [[T-front]]s.\n\n== Terminology ==\nUndergarments are known by a number of terms. ''[[wikt:underclothes|Underclothes]]'', ''underclothing''  and ''[[wikt:underwear|underwear]]'' are formal terms, while undergarments may be more casually called, in Australia, ''[[wikt:Reg Grundys|Reg Grundys]]'' ([[rhyming slang]] for ''undies'') and ''Reginalds'', and, in the United Kingdom, ''[[wikt:smalls|smalls]]'' (from the earlier ''smallclothes'') and (historically) ''unmentionables''. In the United States, women's underwear may be known as ''delicates'' due to the recommended washing machine cycle or because they are, simply put, delicate.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}\n\nWomen's undergarments collectively are called ''[[lingerie]]''. They also are called ''intimate clothing'' and ''[[wikt:intimate|intimates]]''.\n\nAn [[undershirt]] (''[[wikt:vest|vest]]'' in the United Kingdom) is a piece of underwear covering the [[torso]], while [[underpants]] (often ''[[wikt:pants|pants]]'' in the United Kingdom), [[wikt:drawers|drawers]], and shorts cover the [[Sex organ|genitals]] and buttocks. Terms for specific undergarments are shown in the table [[#Types and styles|below]].\n\nNot wearing underpants under outer clothing is known in American slang as ''freeballing'' for men and as ''[[going commando]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=Go commando|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/gocommando.asp|publisher=Word Spy|date=9 April 2001|accessdate=3 April 2008}}</ref> for either sex. The act of a woman not wearing a bra is sometimes referred to as ''freeboobing''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hiles|first=Rebecca|title=DO THIS DON'T: Go Braless With Big Boobs|newspaper=XOJane|date=2 August 2013|accessdate=24 June 2016|url=http://www.xojane.com/fashion/do-this-dont-go-braless-with-big-boobs}}</ref>\n\n== Function ==\nUnderwear is worn for a variety of reasons. They keep outer garments from being soiled by [[perspiration]], [[urine]],<ref>US Patent Number 6447493</ref> [[semen]], [[human feces|feces]], vaginal discharge, and [[menstrual blood]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Voelkel|first=Megan|title=Germ Warfare|newspaper=The Standard|date=31 July 2000|accessdate=23 May 2009|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_print.asp?art_id=69373|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723002652/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_print.asp?art_id=69373|archive-date=23 July 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Women's [[brassiere]]s provide support for the [[breast]]s, and men's [[briefs]] serve the same function for the [[Male reproductive system (human)|male genitalia]]. A [[corset]] may be worn as a [[foundation garment]] to alter a woman's [[female body shape|body shape]]. For additional support and protection when playing sports, men often wear more tightly fitting underwear, including [[jockstrap]]s and jockstraps with cup pocket and [[jockstrap#Protective cup|protective cup]]. Women may wear [[sports bra]]s which provide greater support, thus increasing comfort and reducing the chance of damage to the [[ligament]]s of the chest during high-impact exercises such as jogging.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}\n\nIn cold climates, underwear may constitute an additional layer of clothing helping to keep the wearer warm. Underwear may also be used to preserve the wearer's [[modesty]] \u2013 for instance, some women wear [[camisole]]s and [[Slip (clothing)|slips]] ([[petticoat]]s) under clothes that are [[Sheer (textile)|sheer]]. Conversely, some types of underwear can be worn for sexual titillation, such as [[edible underwear]] or crotchless panties.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}\n\nUndergarments are worn for insulation under [[space suit]]s and [[dry suit]]s. In the case of dry suits, the insulation value of the undergarments is selected to match the expected water temperature and the level of activity for the planned dive or water activity.<ref name=\"Dry suit diving\" >{{cite book|first1=Steven |last1=Barsky |first2=Dick |last2=Long |first3=Bob |last3=Stinton |year=1999 |title=Dry Suit Diving |edition=3rd |publisher=Hammerhead Press |location=Santa Barbara, California |isbn=978-0-9674305-0-8}}</ref>\n\nSome items of clothing are designed exclusively as underwear, while others such as [[T-shirt]]s and certain types of shorts are suitable both as underwear and as outer clothing. The suitability of underwear as outer clothing is, apart from the indoor or outdoor climate, largely dependent on societal norms, fashion, and the requirements of the law. If made of suitable material, some underwear can serve as [[nightwear]] or [[swimsuit]]s.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}\n\n=== Religious functions ===\nUndergarments can also have religious significance:\n\n<!--Please arrange alphabetically.-->\n* '''Judaism'''.

Zoroastrians wear an undershirt called a ''[[Sedreh]]'' that is fastened with a sacred girdle around the waist known as a ''[[Kushti]]''.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Ancient history ===\n[[File:PiazzaArmerina-Mosaik-Bikini.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[mosaic]] from the [[Piazza Armerina]] in Sicily showing a woman wearing a ''[[strophium]]'' (breastcloth) and a ''[[subligaculum]]'']]\n[[File:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry juillet braies.jpg|thumb|upright|A loincloth in 1412 ''[[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'']]\nThe [[loincloth]] is the simplest form of underwear; it was probably the first undergarment worn by human beings. In warmer climates the loincloth was often the only clothing worn (effectively making it an outer garment rather than an undergarment), as was doubtless its origin, but in colder regions the loincloth often formed the basis of a person's clothing and was covered by other garments. In most ancient civilizations, this was the only undergarment available.\n\nA loincloth may take three major forms. The first, and simplest, is simply a long strip of material which is passed between the legs and then around the waist. Archaeologists have found the remains of such loincloths made of leather dating back 7,000 years.<ref name=\"Independent\">{{cite news|last=Rushton|first=Susie|title=A brief history of pants: Why men's smalls have always been a subject of concern|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/a-brief-history-of-pants-why-mens-smalls-have-always-been-a-subject-of-concern-771772.html|work=[[The Independent]] (Extra)|date=22 January 2008|pages=2\u20135|location=London}}</ref> The ancient Hawaiian ''malo'' was of this form, as are several styles of the Japanese ''[[fundoshi]]''. Another form is usually called a [[cache-sexe]]: a triangle of cloth is provided with strings or loops, which are used to fasten the triangle between the legs and over the genitals. [[Egypt]]ian king [[Tutankhamun]] (1341 BC \u2013 1323 BC) was found buried with numerous [[linen]] loincloths of this style.<ref name=\"Independent\" /><!--The article used to state \"145\", but this number is currently unreferenced.--> An alternate form is more [[skirt]]-like: a cloth is wrapped around the hips several times and then fastened with a [[girdle]].\n\nMen are said to have worn loincloths in [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], though it is unclear whether Greek women wore undergarments. There is some speculation that only slaves wore loincloths and that citizens did not wear undergarments beneath their [[Chiton (costume)|chitons]]. [[Mosaic]]s of the Roman period indicate that women (primarily in an athletic context, whilst wearing nothing else) sometimes wore ''strophiae'' (breastcloths) or [[brassiere]]s made of soft leather, along with ''[[Subligaculum|subligacula]]'' which were either in the form of shorts or loincloths. ''Subligacula'' were also worn by men.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nThe fabric used for loincloths may have been [[wool]], [[linen]] or a [[linsey-woolsey]] blend. Only the upper classes could have afforded imported silk.\n\nThe loincloth continues to be worn by people around the world \u2013 it is the traditional form of undergarment in many Asian societies, for example. In various, mainly tropical, cultures, the traditional male dress may still consist of only a single garment below the waist or even none at all, with underwear as optional, including the Indian ''[[dhoti]]'' and ''[[lungi]]'', or the Scottish [[kilt]].\n\n[[File:Braies.jpg|thumb|left|Medieval ''[[braies]]'']]\n\n=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], western men's underwear became looser fitting. The loincloth was replaced by loose, [[Trousers|trouser]]-like clothing called [[braies]], which the wearer stepped into and then laced or tied around the waist and legs at about mid-calf. Wealthier men often wore [[chausses]] as well, which only covered the legs.<ref name=\"Independent\" /> Braies (or rather [[braccae]]) were a type of trouser worn by Celtic and Germanic tribes in antiquity and by Europeans subsequently into the Middle Ages. In the later Middle Ages they were used exclusively as undergarments.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[File:Tizian 081.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1532\u20131533 portrait by [[Titian]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], in a codpiece]]\n\nBy the time of the [[Renaissance]], braies had become shorter to accommodate longer styles of chausses. Chausses were also giving way to form-fitting [[Hose (clothing)|hose]],<ref name=\"Independent\" /> which covered the legs and feet. Fifteenth-century hose were often particolored, with each leg in a different-coloured fabric or even more than one colour on a leg. However, many types of braies, chausses and hose were not intended to be covered up by other clothing, so they were not actually underwear in the strict sense.\n\nBraies were usually fitted with a front flap that was buttoned or tied closed. This [[codpiece]] allowed men to [[Urination|urinate]] without having to remove the braies completely.<ref name=\"Independent\" /> Codpieces were also worn with hose when very short [[Doublet (clothing)|doublets]] \u2013 vest- (UK: waistcoat-) like garments tied together in the front and worn under other clothing \u2013 were in fashion, as early forms of hose were open at the [[crotch]]. [[Henry VIII of England]] began padding his codpiece, which caused a spiralling trend of larger and larger codpieces that only ended by the end of the 16th century. It has been speculated that the King may have had the [[sexually transmitted disease]] [[syphilis]], and his large codpiece may have included a bandage soaked in medication to relieve its symptoms.<ref name=\"Independent\" /> Henry VIII also wanted a healthy son and may have thought that projecting himself in this way would portray fertility. Codpieces were sometimes used as a pocket for holding small items.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Vernon big.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A lady in her private [[boudoir]]; wearing an informal embroidered jacket over her rose-pink [[corset]] or simple [[bodice]] and decorated [[petticoat]], ''c.'' 1600]]\n\nOver the upper part of their bodies, both medieval men and women usually wore a close-fitting shirt-like garment called a [[chemise]] in France, or a smock or shift in England. The forerunner of the modern-day shirt, the chemise was tucked into a man's braies, under his outer clothing. Women wore a chemise underneath their [[gown]]s or [[robe]]s, sometimes with [[petticoat]]s over the chemise. Elaborately [[Quilting|quilted]] petticoats might be displayed by a cut-away dress, in which case they served a skirt rather than an undergarment. During the 16th century, the [[farthingale]] was popular. This was a petticoat stiffened with [[Phragmites|reed]] or [[willow]] rods so that it stood out from a woman's body like a cone extending from the waist.\n\nCorsets also began to be worn about this time. At first they were called pairs of bodies, which refers to a stiffened decorative [[bodice]] worn on top of another bodice stiffened with [[buckram]], reeds, canes, [[Baleen|whalebone]] or other materials. These were not the small-waisted, curved corsets familiar from the [[Victorian era]], but straight-lined stays that flattened the bust.\n\nMen's braies and hose were eventually replaced by simple cotton, silk, or [[linen]] drawers, which were usually knee-length trousers with a button flap in the front.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nMedieval people wearing only tunics, without underpants, can be seen on works like [[commons:File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Ass in the School - WGA03526.jpg|The Ass in the School]] by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], in the\n[[commons:File:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry f\u00e9vrier.jpg|Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry]] by [[Limbourg Brothers]], or in the [[commons:File:15th-century unknown painters - Grimani Breviary - The Month of February - WGA15776.jpg|Grimani Breviary: The Month of February]] by [[Gerard Horenbout]].\n\nIn 2012, findings in [[Lengberg Castle]], in [[Austria]], showed that [[lace]] and [[linen]] brassiere-like garments, one of which greatly resembled the modern bra, date back to hundreds of years before it was thought to exist.<ref>{{cite news|work=Time|accessdate=21 July 2012|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/07/19/600-year-old-bras-unearthed-in-austrian-castle/|title=600-year-old bras unearthed in Austrian castle|date=19 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=uibk>{{cite web|url=http://www.uibk.ac.at/urgeschichte/projekte_forschung/textilien-lengberg/medieval-lingerie-from-lengberg-castle-east-tyrol.html |accessdate=21 July 2012 |publisher=University of Innsbruck |title=Medieval lingerie from Lengberg, East-Tyrol |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206041713/http://www.uibk.ac.at/urgeschichte/projekte_forschung/textilien-lengberg/medieval-lingerie-from-lengberg-castle-east-tyrol.html |archivedate= 6 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\n=== Enlightenment and Industrial Age ===\n[[File:Tight lacing.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''Tight Lacing, or Fashion Before Ease'', an early-1770s [[Satire|satirical]] drawing by John Collet]]\n\nThe invention of the [[spinning jenny]] machines and the [[cotton gin]] in the second half of the 18th century made cotton fabrics widely available. This allowed factories to [[mass production|mass-produce]] underwear, and for the first time, people began buying undergarments in stores rather than making them at home.\n\nWomen's [[History of corsets#16th to late 18th centuries|stays]] of the 18th century were laced behind and drew the shoulders back to form a high, round bosom and erect posture. Coloured stays were popular. With the relaxed country styles of the end of the century, stays became shorter and were [[Bone (corsetry)|unboned]] or only lightly boned, and were now called corsets. As tight waists became fashionable in the 1820s, the corset was again boned and laced to form the figure. By the 1860s, a tiny (\"[[Wasp waist|wasp]]\") waist came to be seen as a symbol of beauty, and the corsets were stiffened with whalebone or steel to accomplish this. Tight lacing of a corset sometimes led to a woman needing to retire to the [[fainting room]]. By the 1880s, the [[Victorian dress reform|dress reform]] movement was campaigning against the pain and damage to internal organs and bones caused by [[Tightlacing|tight lacing]]. Inez Gaches-Sarraute invented the \"health corset\", with a straight-fronted bust made to help support the wearer's muscles.\n\nThe corset was usually worn over a thin shirt-like shift of linen or cotton or [[muslin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Regency nightwear: Shift|url=http://www.janeausten.co.uk/magazine/page.ihtml?pid=478&step=4|publisher=[[Jane Austen|The Jane Austen Centre]]|accessdate=7 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521083811/http://www.janeausten.co.uk/magazine/page.ihtml?pid=478&step=4|archive-date=21 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Skirt]] styles became shorter and long drawers called [[pantalettes]] or [[wikt:pantaloons|pantaloons]] kept the legs covered. Pantalettes originated in France in the early 19th century, and quickly spread to Britain and America. Pantalettes were a form of [[leggings]] or long drawers. They could be one-piece or two separate garments, one for each leg, attached at the waist with buttons or laces. The crotch was left open for hygiene reasons.\n\n[[File:Perfect Health Corset.png|thumb|left|\"Health corsets\" in 1883]]\nAs skirts became fuller from the 1830s, women wore many petticoats to achieve a fashionable bell shape. By the 1850s, stiffened [[crinoline]]s and later [[hoop skirt]]s allowed ever wider skirts to be worn. The [[bustle]], a frame or pad worn over the buttocks to enhance their shape, had been used off and on by women for two centuries, but reached the height of its popularity in the later 1880s, and went out of fashion for good in the 1890s.\nWomen dressed in crinolines often wore drawers under them for modesty and warmth.\n\nAnother common undergarment of the late 19th century for men, women, and children was the [[union suit]]. Invented in [[Utica, New York]] and patented in 1868, this was a one-piece front-buttoning garment usually made of knitted material with sleeves extending to the wrists and legs down to the ankles. It had a buttoned flap (known colloquially as the \"access hatch\", \"drop seat\", or \"fireman's flap\") in the back to ease visits to the toilet. The union suit was the precursor of [[Long underwear|long johns]], a two-piece garment consisting of a long-sleeved top and long pants possibly named after American boxer [[John L. Sullivan]] who wore a similar garment in the ring.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nThe [[jockstrap]] was invented in 1874, by C.F. Bennett of a Chicago sporting goods company, Sharp & Smith, to provide comfort and support for bicycle jockeys riding the [[cobblestone]] streets of [[Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"Independent\" /> In 1897 Bennett's newly formed Bike Web Company patented and began mass-producing the Bike Jockey Strap.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.bikeathletic.com/History.aspx|publisher=[[BIKE Athletic Company]]|year=2004|accessdate=7 April 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124113927/http://www.bikeathletic.com/History.aspx|archivedate=24 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n=== 1900s to 1920s ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Underwear1913.JPG|thumb|upright|Ladies' underwear advertisement, 1913]]\n[[File:NewBritainUnderwearWashingDirections.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|How to handwash the New Britain Standard Hygienic Underwear, ''c.'' 1915]]\n\nBy the early 20th century, the mass-produced undergarment industry was booming, and competition forced producers to come up with all sorts of innovative and gimmicky designs to compete. The [[Hanes]] company emerged from this boom and quickly established itself as a top manufacturer of union suits, which were common until the 1930s.<ref name=\"Independent\" /> Textile technology continued to improve, and the time to make a single union suit dropped from days to minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, designers of women's undergarments relaxed the corset. The invention of new, flexible but supportive materials allowed whalebone and steel bones to be removed. The emancipation or [[liberty bodice]] offered an alternative to constricting corsets, and in Australia and the UK the liberty bodice became a standard item for girls as well as women.\n\nMen's underwear was also on the rise. Benjamin Joseph Clark, a migrant to [[Louisiana]] from [[New Jersey]], opened a [[venture capital]]ist firm named Bossier in [[Bossier Parish, Louisiana|Bossier Parish]]. One product manufactured by his firm was tightly fitting boxers that resembled modern underwear. Though the company was bankrupt by the early 20th century, it had some impact on men's underwear design.\n\nUnderwear advertising first made an appearance in the 1910s. The first underwear print advertisement in the US appeared in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1911 and featured oil paintings by [[J. C. Leyendecker]] of the \"Kenosha Klosed Krotch\". Early underwear advertisements emphasised durability and comfort, and fashion was not regarded as a selling point.\n\nBy the end of the 1910s, Chalmers Knitting Company split the union suit into upper and lower sections, effectively inventing the modern undershirt and drawers. Women wore lacier versions of this basic duo known as the [[camisole]] and tap pants.\n[[File:WarnerStyle70 1922.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.4|A corset over \"step ins\" and camisole, 1922]]\n\nIn 1912, the US had its first professional underwear designer. Lindsay \"Layneau\" Boudreaux, a French immigrant, established the short-lived panty company Layneau. Though her company closed within one year, it had a significant impact on many levels. Boudreaux showed the world that an American woman could establish and run a company, and she also caused a revolution in the underwear industry.\n\nIn 1913, a New York socialite named [[Mary Phelps Jacob]] created the first modern brassiere by tying two handkerchiefs together with ribbon. Jacob's original intention was to cover the whalebone sticking out of her corset, which was visible through her sheer dress. Jacob began making brassieres for her family and friends, and news of the garment soon spread by word of mouth. By 1914, Jacob had a patent for her design and was marketing it throughout the US. Although women had worn brassiere-like garments in years past, Jacob's was the first to be successfully marketed and widely adopted.\n\nBy the end of the decade, trouser-like \"[[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]]\", which were popularized by [[Amelia Jenks Bloomer]] (1818\u20131894) but invented by [[Elizabeth Smith Miller]], gained popularity with the so-called [[Gibson Girl]]s who enjoyed pursuits such as cycling and tennis. This new female athleticism helped push the corset out of style. The other major factor in the corset's demise was the fact that metal was globally in short supply during the First World War. Steel-laced corsets were dropped in favour of the brassiere.\n\n{{multiple image\n|width1 = 200 |image1 =11 women and a little girl lined up for bathing beauty contest.png |caption1 = Bathing suit contest, 1920\n|width2 = 215 |image2 = Group of young women in thong bikinis 2.jpg |caption2 = [[Swimsuit competition]], 2005 }}\nMeanwhile, World War I soldiers were issued button-front shorts as underwear. The buttons attached to a separate piece of cloth, or \"yoke\", sewn to the front of the garment, and tightness of fit was adjusted by means of ties on the sides. This design proved so popular that it began to supplant the union suit in popularity by the end of the war. [[Rayon]] garments also became widely available in the post-war period.\n\nIn the 1920s, manufacturers shifted emphasis from durability to comfort. Union suit advertisements raved about patented new designs that reduced the number of buttons and increased accessibility. Most of these experimental designs had to do with new ways to hold closed the crotch flap common on most union suits and drawers. A new woven cotton fabric called [[nainsook]] gained popularity in the 1920s for its durability. Retailers also began selling preshrunk undergarments.\n\nAlso in the 1920s, as [[hemline]]s of women's dresses rose, women began to wear stockings to cover the exposed legs. Women's bloomers also became much shorter. The shorter bloomers became looser and less supportive as the boyish [[flapper]] look came into fashion. By the end of the decade, they came to be known as \"step-ins\", very much like modern panties but with wider legs. They were worn for the increased flexibility they afforded.\n\nThe [[Garter belts|garter belt]] was invented to keep stockings from falling.\n\nIn 1928, [[Maidenform]], a company operated by [[Ida Rosenthal]], a Jewish immigrant from Russia, developed the brassiere and introduced modern cup sizes for bras.\n\n=== 1930s and 1940s ===\n[[File:Maninboxers.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A man wearing a pair of [[boxer shorts]]]]\n\nModern men's underwear was largely an invention of the 1930s. On 19 January 1935, [[Coopers Inc.]] sold the world's first briefs in Chicago. Designed by an \"apparel engineer\" named Arthur Kneibler, briefs dispensed with leg sections and had a Y-shaped overlapping fly.<ref name=\"Independent\" /> The company dubbed the design the \"Jockey\" since it offered a degree of support that had previously only been available from the jockstrap. Jockey briefs proved so popular that over 30,000 pairs were sold within three months of their introduction. Coopers, having renamed the company [[Jockey International|Jockey]], sent its \"Mascul-line\" plane to make special deliveries of \"masculine support\" briefs to retailers across the US. In 1938, when Jockeys were introduced in the UK, they sold at the rate of 3,000 a week.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nIn this decade, companies also began selling buttonless drawers fitted with an elastic waistband. These were the first true boxer shorts, which were named for their resemblance to the shorts worn by [[Boxing|professional fighters]]. Scovil Manufacturing introduced the [[snap fastener]] at this time, which became a popular addition to various kinds of undergarments.\n\nWomen of the 1930s brought the corset back, now called the \"[[girdle]]\". The garment lacked the whalebone and metal supports and usually came with a brassiere (now usually called a \"bra\") and attached garters.\n\nDuring World War II, elastic waistbands and metal snaps gave way once again to button fasteners due to rubber and metal shortages. Undergarments were harder to find as well, since soldiers abroad had priority to obtain them. By the end of the war, Jockey and Hanes remained the industry leaders in the US, but Cluett, Peabody and Company made a name for itself when it introduced a preshrinking process called \"[[Sanforization]]\", invented by Sanford Cluett in 1933, which came to be licensed by most major manufacturers.\n\nMeanwhile, some women adopted the corset once again, now called the \"[[Waist cincher|waspie]]\" for the [[wasp]]-shaped [[waist]]line it gave the wearer. Many women began wearing the strapless bra as well, which gained popularity for its ability to push the breasts up and [[Cleavage enhancement|enhance cleavage]].\n\n=== 1950s and '60s ===\nBefore the 1950s, underwear consisted of simple, white pieces of clothing which were not to be shown in public. In the 1950s, underwear came to be promoted as a fashion item in its own right, and came to be made in prints and colours. Manufacturers also experimented with rayon and newer fabrics like [[Dacron]], nylon, and [[Spandex]].<ref name=\"Independent\" /> By the 1960, men's underwear was regularly printed in loud patterns, or with messages or images such as cartoon characters. By the 1960s, department stores began offering men's double-seat briefs, an optional feature that would double the wear and add greater comfort. Stores advertising the double thickness seat as well as the manufacturing brands such as [[Hanes]] and [[BVD]] during this time period can be viewed<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17628182/the_poststar/|title=Clipped From The Post-Star|date=1968-09-12|work=The Post-Star|access-date=2020-01-13|pages=20}}</ref> using [[Newspapers.com]].\n\nWomen's undergarments began to emphasize the breasts instead of the waist. The decade saw the introduction of the bullet bra pointed bust, inspired by [[Christian Dior]]'s \"[[Christian Dior#The New Look|New Look]]\", which featured pointed cups. The original [[Wonderbra]] and [[Brassiere designs|push-up bra]] by [[Frederick's of Hollywood]] finally hit it big.  Women's panties became more colourful and decorative, and by the mid-1960s were available in two abbreviated styles called the hip-hugger and the [[bikini]] (named after the Pacific Ocean [[Bikini Atoll|island]] of that name), frequently in sheer nylon fabric.\n\n[[Pantyhose]], also called ''tights'' in British English, which combined panties and hose into one garment, made their first appearance in 1959,<ref name=Belkin1986>{{cite news|last=Belkin|first=Lisa|title=Lingerie's Great Leap Forward|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/24/business/lingerie-s-great-leap-forward.html|accessdate=17 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 August 1986}}</ref> invented by Glen Raven Mills of [[North Carolina]]. The company later introduced seamless pantyhose in 1965, spurred by the popularity of the [[miniskirt]].

[[Sexual attraction|Sex appeal]] became the main selling point, in swimwear as well, bringing to fruition a trend that had been building since at least the flapper era.\n\nThe [[Sleeveless shirt|tank top]], an undershirt named after the type of swimwear dating from the 1920s known as a tank suit or [[maillot]], became popular warm-weather casual outerwear in the US in the 1980s. Performers such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]] were also often seen wearing their undergarments on top of other clothes.\n\nAlthough worn for decades by [[exotic dancer]]s, in the 1980s the [[G-string]] first gained popularity in South America, particularly in Brazil. Originally a style of [[swimsuit]], the back of the garment is so narrow that it disappears between the buttocks. By the 1990s the design had made its way to most of the Western world, and [[Thong (clothing)|thong underwear]] became popular. Today, the thong is one of the fastest-selling styles of underwear among women, and is also worn by men.\n\nWhile health and practicality had previously been emphasized, in the 1970s retailers of men's underpants began focusing on fashion and sex appeal. Designers such as [[Calvin Klein]] began featuring near-naked models in their advertisements for white [[briefs]]. The increased wealth of the [[gay community]] helped to promote a diversity of undergarment choices.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In his book ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol]]'' (1975),<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Andy Warhol]]|title=The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: (From A to B and Back Again)|location=London|publisher=[[Orion Publishing Group|Cassell]]|year=1975|isbn=0-86018-109-X}}</ref> [[Andy Warhol]] wrote:\n\n{{quote|I told B I needed some socks too and at least 30 pairs of Jockey shorts.

[[Hip hop music|Hip hop]] stars popularized \"[[Sagging (fashion)|sagging]]\", in which loosely fitting jeans or shorts were allowed to droop below the waist, exposing the waistband or a greater portion of boxer shorts, briefs, or boxer briefs worn underneath. The chiseled muscularity of [[Mark Wahlberg]] (then known as Marky Mark) in a series of 1990s underwear advertisements for Calvin Klein briefs led to his success as a white hip hop star and a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actor.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\n== Trends ==\n{{See also|Underwear fetishism}}\nSome people choose not to wear any underpants, a practice sometimes referred to as \"[[going commando]]\", for comfort, to enable their outer garments (particularly those which are form-fitting) to look more flattering, to avoid creating a [[panty line]], because they find it sexually exciting, or because they do not see any need for them. Certain types of clothes, such as [[cycling shorts]] and [[kilt]]s, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underpants. This also applies for most clothes worn as [[nightwear]] and as [[swimwear]]. Some analysts have encouraged people with a higher than average [[libido]] to change their underwear more frequently than average due hygiene-related issues of by-products such as [[cowper's fluid]] and [[vaginal lubrication]].<ref>{{cite article\n|last1=Bagnol\n|first1=Brigitte\n|first2=Esmeralda\n|last2=Mariano\n|title=Vaginal practices: eroticism and implications for women's health and condom use in Mozambique\n|journal=[[Culture, Health & Sexuality]]\n|volume=10\n|number=6\n|year=2008\n|pages=573\u2013585.}}</ref>\n[[File:UserBrentTheEmoKid Boxer Shorts Sagging Fad.png|thumb|upright|Sagging pants, revealing much of the wearer's underwear.]]\n\nUnderwear is sometimes partly exposed for fashion reasons or to titillate. A woman may, for instance, allow the top of her brassiere to be visible from under her [[Collar (clothing)|collar]], or wear a see-through [[blouse]] over it. Some men wear T-shirts underneath partly or fully unbuttoned shirts. A common style among young men (2018) is to allow the trousers to [[Sagging (fashion)|sag]] below the waist, thus revealing the waistband or a greater portion of whatever underwear the man is wearing. A woman wearing low-rise trousers may expose the upper rear portion of her thong underwear is said to display a \"[[whale tail]]\".\n\n===Used underwear===\nThe sale of used female underwear for sexual purposes began in [[Sexuality in Japan|Japan]], in stores called [[burusera]], and it was even sold in vending machines. In the 21st century, when the [[Internet]] made anonymous mail-order sales possible for individuals, some women in the U.S. and U.K., in response to male demand, began selling their dirty panties, and sometimes other underwear. Some men find the odor of a woman's bodily secretions sexually arousing, and will use the dirty panties as a [[masturbation]] aid. The sale of dirty panties, sometimes worn for several days, and sometimes customized with requested stains, is a significant [[niche market|niche]] in the [[sex work]] field.
