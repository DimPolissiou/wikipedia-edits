Established in 1823 as the '''London Mechanics' Institute''' by its founder, Sir [[George Birkbeck]], and its supporters, [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|J. C. Hobhouse]] and [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], Birkbeck is one of the few universities to specialise in evening [[higher education]] in the United Kingdom.\n\nBirkbeck's main building is based in the area of [[Bloomsbury]] in [[London Borough of Camden]] in Central London. In partnership with [[University of East London]], Birkbeck has an additional large campus in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], next to the [[Theatre Royal Stratford East|Theatre Royal]]. Birkbeck offers over 200 undergraduate and postgraduate programmes that can be studied either part-time or full-time, though nearly all lectures are given in the evening. Birkbeck's academic activities are organised into five constituent faculties which are subdivided into nineteen departments. Birkbeck, being part of the [[University of London]], shares the University's academic standards and awards University of London degrees. In common with the other University of London colleges, Birkbeck has also secured its own independent degree awarding powers, which were confirmed by the Privy Council in July 2012. The quality of degrees awarded by Birkbeck was confirmed by the UK [[Quality Assurance Agency]] following institutional audits in 2005 and 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Degree-awarding powers|url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/about-us/governance/degree-awarding|website=www.bbk.ac.uk/|publisher=Birkbeck, University of London|accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nBirkbeck is a member of academic organisations such as the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]] and the [[European University Association]].

Established in 1823 as the '''London Mechanics' Institute''' by its founder, Sir [[George Birkbeck]], and its supporters, [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|J. C. Hobhouse]] and [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], Birkbeck is one of the few universities to specialise in evening [[higher education]] in the United Kingdom.\n\nBirkbeck's main building is based in the area of [[Bloomsbury]] in [[London Borough of Camden]] in Central London. In partnership with [[University of East London]], Birkbeck has an additional large campus in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], next to the [[Theatre Royal Stratford East|Theatre Royal]]. Birkbeck offers over 200 undergraduate and postgraduate programmes that can be studied either part-time or full-time, though nearly all lectures are given in the evening. Birkbeck's academic activities are organised into five constituent faculties which are subdivided into nineteen departments. Birkbeck, being part of the [[University of London]], shares the University's academic standards and awards University of London degrees. In common with the other University of London colleges, Birkbeck has also secured its own independent degree awarding powers, which were confirmed by the Privy Council in July 2012. The quality of degrees awarded by Birkbeck was confirmed by the UK [[Quality Assurance Agency]] following institutional audits in 2005 and 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Degree-awarding powers|url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/about-us/governance/degree-awarding|website=www.bbk.ac.uk/|publisher=Birkbeck, University of London|accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nBirkbeck is a member of academic organisations such as the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]] and the [[European University Association]].

He is also included in the ''Player's Handbook'' as one of the deities of Greyhawk.  In both, he is listed as the god of evil secrets.  Additionally, both his hand and eye are listed as artifacts.\n\n==Description==\nVecna is usually depicted as a powerful magician resembling a desiccated corpse missing his left [[Hand of Vecna|hand]] and [[Eye of Vecna|eye]]. A constant theme in the adventures in which the character appears is Vecna's never-ending quest for power, ending, should he succeed, with Vecna as the only deity in existence.\n\n==Relationships==\nVecna has few allies, and countless enemies. In 2nd and 3rd Edition, his greatest, and perhaps only true ally is the mysterious entity known as the [[Mok'slyk|Serpent]]. In 4th edition, the Open Grave book introduces Osterneth, the Bronze Lich, as the mightiest servant of Vecna. The famed [[Cambion (Dungeons & Dragons)|cambion]] lich, [[Acererak]], once served Vecna, but the current status of their relationship is unknown. Among Vecna's staunchest foes are [[Kas the Bloody-Handed|Kas]], [[Iuz]], [[Saint Cuthbert (Dungeons & Dragons)|Saint Cuthbert]], the Lady of Pain, [[Pholtus]], and the [[Circle of Eight]]. He is also opposed by the [[Old Faith]] and the [[Silent Ones]].\n\nIn 4th edition, Vecna's main foes in the realm of death and undeath are [[Kas the Bloody-Handed|Kas]], [[Orcus (Dungeons & Dragons)|Orcus]] and the [[Raven Queen]] (though he would rather she rule the dead than Orcus). Among the gods, [[Ioun]] is something of Vecna's antithesis, for she would share with the world all the knowledge he would keep secret.\n\n==Dogma==\n\n===Scriptures===\nBeing a secretive cult, there are no real collections of Vecnan teachings. However, copies of the ''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]'' are highly prized by the cult for Vecna's role in that work's development. The ''Open Grave'' book offers the \"Scroll of Mauthereign\", which offers a twisted version of Vecna's history and tells his followers that committing evil acts is holy and righteous.\n\n==Worshippers==\nVecna's cult is very secretive, and cells have been uncovered, at various points in history, in [[Diamond Lake (Greyhawk)|Diamond Lake]], [[Greyhawk City|Greyhawk]], and [[Verbobonc]]. Temples to Vecna have also been reported in the [[Pomarj]] town of [[Highport]] and [[Erelhei-Cinlu]], the debased city at the heart of the [[Vault of the Drow]].\n\n===Hierarchy===\nEach position in Vecna's cult is named for a certain body part. At the top is Vecna himself, followed by the Voice of Vecna, which can only be filled by Vecna's manifestation.\n\nNext is the Heart of Vecna, the high priest of the cult. The last known Heart of Vecna was [[Diraq Malcinex]] of [[Ket (Greyhawk)|Ket]], who was slain by adventurers in 581 CY.\n\nImmediately below the Heart of Vecna are two bizarre monsters known as the Hand and the Eye. The [[Hand and Eye of Vecna (monsters)|Eye of Vecna]] creature appears as a slender humanoid with an eyeball for a head, whereas the [[Hand and Eye of Vecna (monsters)|Hand of Vecna]] appears as a stocky humanoid with a huge left hand where its head should be.\n\nIndividual congregations are known as organs. Each organ is led by a Thought of Vecna. Lesser priests are known as Memories of Vecna.\n\nLay members of the cult consist of the Teeth, Fingers, Blood, and Spawn of Vecna. The Teeth of Vecna are made up of [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|wizards]], and specialize in arcane spellcasting and crafting magical items for the cult. The Fingers of Vecna consist mainly of [[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|thieves]], who engage in various forms of subterfuge. The Blood of Vecna are mainly [[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|warriors]] charged with protection and enforcement of the cult and its goals. The Spawn of Vecna are the lowest in the cult hierarchy, and consist of the common people who honor the Lich Lord.\n\nIn 4th edition, the ''Open Grave'' book shows the leader of the cult of Vecna is a lich named Mauthereign. Even when Osterneth, the Bronze Lich, is Vecna's mightiest servant, her position is not revealed among his files.\n\n===Other Vecnan organizations===\nOther Vecnan organizations are known to exist outside of the mainstream cult, and some may have similar or identical names. Relations between these groups and the mainstream cult may vary. Known examples are the Eyes of Vecna (a cult of undeath consisting mainly of rogues), the Fingers of Vecna (Vecna's personal guard), and the [[Ebon Triad]] (a heretical cult seeking to merge Vecna, [[Hextor]], and [[Erythnul]] into a single entity).\n\nIn 4th edition, a secret group known as the Keepers of the Forbidden Lore is devoted to Vecna. Unlike most Vecna worshippers, the Keepers reject most of the nasty and evil rituals and beliefs associated with the god; they worship him as the God of Secrets, and believe that there is some knowledge too evil for the world to know. They instead hunt down secrets and information they deem to be too dangerous for the world at large and keep it secret in the name of Vecna. This puts them in opposition to mainstream followers of Vecna who regard the Keepers as heretics, and makes them enemies of Ioun and her followers, who believe all knowledge should be available for everybody and the moral obligations on how to use it rest on the shoulders of the individuals involved.\n\n==Artifacts==\n[[File:VecnaLivesCover.jpg|thumb|The Hand and Eye of Vecna, as shown on the cover of ''[[Vecna Lives!]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1990)]]\n\n===''Hand'' and ''Eye of Vecna''===\nThe left hand and eye of Vecna's original \"mortal\" lich form, which have never been replaced in his later more powerful incarnations, are now high-valued and very dangerous magical [[Magic item (Dungeons & Dragons)#Artifacts|artifacts]].<ref name=\"GDR\"/> To use the powers of the Hand of Vecna or the Eye of Vecna one is required to cut off one's own corresponding body part and affix Vecna's in its place.  These artifacts were introduced in the third supplement to the original D&D rules, ''[[Eldritch Wizardry]]''.  They went on to appear in all subsequent D&D editions.  They are considered classic items in D&D,<ref name=\"GDR\"/> with Mordicai Knode of [[Tor.com]] commenting \"We all agree that the ''Hand and Eye of Vecna'' are the best artifacts, right?\"<ref>http://www.tor.com/2013/05/23/adad-the-old-firm/</ref>\n\n===''Sword of Kas''===\nVecna created the ''[[Sword of Kas]]'' for his greatest servant, which contains a \"portion of his consciousness.\"\n\nThis interpretation is relatively recent. As per the 1st edition ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', Vecna only procured this most powerful sword for his chief lieutenant. Similarly, depending on edition and source, its appearance has varied, from a short sword to a wavy bladed two hander. However, it is undoubtable that the ''Sword'' is inextricably tied to Vecna's relics.\n\n===Other artifacts===\nA number of Vecna's other body parts are presented as minor artifacts in ''[[Die Vecna Die!]]'', including the ''First Digit'' (right thumb), ''Second Digit'' (right index finger), ''Third Digit'' (right middle finger), ''Last Digit'' (right pinky finger), ''Incisors'' (a pair of inappropriately named fang-like canines), ''Molar'', ''Scalp'', ''Skin'', ''Heart'', ''Foot'' (left), and ''Right Eye''. These artifacts are collectively known in D&D 3rd Edition as the ''Fragments of Vecna''. The ''Compendium Maleficarum'' is a book of spells, doctrines, and secrets crafted entirely from bone (even the pages) and penned in blood, that is on par with the ''Fragments of Vecna''. The ''Tome of Shared Secrets'' is an illustrated bestiary of relic status, with the ability to impart knowledge of dark and evil creatures at the cost of a portion the user's life force. Those two books were superseded in 5th edition by a combined ''Book of Vile Darkness'', a legacy of dark secrets started by Vecna. The ''Rod of the Whispered One'', while not nearly so powerful as the ''Sword of Kas'', is another item Vecna crafted to connect himself with his highest lieutenants. The final issue of Dragon Magazine, issue #359, featured rules for the \"Left Ear of Vecna\" as a minor artifact. It grants the owner magical bonuses to hearing and resisting sonic attacks, spell-like abilities to inflict deafness, grant clairaudience and create sonic blasts, and enables them to understand any spoken language. A lich known as Osterneth possesses the \"Heart of Vecna\" according to the ''Open Grave'' sourcebook.\n\n===''Head of Vecna''===\nThe ''Head of Vecna'' was a hoax that one adventuring party played on another in a campaign run by [[game master]] Mark Steuer.  One of the groups tricked the other into going on a quest for the ''Head of Vecna'', a hoax [[Magic item (Dungeons & Dragons)#Artifacts|artifact]] that was supposedly similar to his ''Hand'' and ''Eye'', but was simply an ordinary severed head.  The hoax takes advantage of the fact that the ''Eye'' and ''Hand'' require a person to remove their own eye or hand and replace it with the artifact to function.  The characters involved in the story reasoned that they needed to decapitate themselves to gain the powers of the Head of Vecna, and several members of the group actually fought over which character would get to have his head cut off and replaced.  After the third character died, the joke was revealed.<ref>[http://www.sjgames.com/ill/1996/ill-dec96.html ''Daily Illuminator'', December 6, 1996]</ref>\n\nThe ''Head of Vecna'' was later mentioned by Morte, a floating skull in ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', when discussing his lack of a body, made a [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] appearance in the 2000 AD&D campaign ''[[Die Vecna Die!]]'', and was the subject of a short adventure on the Wizards of the Coast website in 2007.<ref>[http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/oa/20070401a The Head of Vecna: A D&D Adventure for Characters Levels 1\u201312]</ref>\n\nFamiliarity with the ''Head of Vecna'' was cited as an example characteristic of an avid role-playing gamer by writer [[David M. Ewalt]].<ref name=ODaM>{{cite book | first=David M. | last=Ewalt | authorlink= David M. Ewalt | year=2013 | title= Of Dice and Men: The Story of Dungeons & Dragons and the People Who Play It | publisher=Scribner | page=1 | isbn=978-1-4516-4052-6 }}</ref>\n\n==Character history==\nVecna was born as a human, centuries ago as a member of the untouchable caste in the [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]] city of Fleeth on [[Oerth]]. He was initially trained by his mother, Mazzel, in the art of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], before she was executed by the government of Fleeth for practicing witchcraft. Vowing revenge, Vecna eventually assumed a mastery of the dark arts achieved by no mortal before or since. Some say this achievement was due to direct tutelage by  [[Mok'slyk]] the Serpent, believed to be the personification of arcane magic itself.\n\nNearly one thousand years after his birth, Vecna, now a [[Lich (Dungeons & Dragons)|lich]] and ruler of a great and terrible empire (in the [[Sheldomar Valley]], centered near the modern-day [[Rushmoors]]), laid siege to the city of Fleeth with an army of arcane spellcasters and undead. Legend has it that Vecna was nearly slain in this battle by clerics channeling the power of [[Pholtus]], the god of light. The clerics unleashed a great burst of light, which hit Vecna primarily on his left side. Vecna was rescued and brought to safety by one of his wizard generals, a cambion named [[Acererak]] (who would one day himself become a mighty [[Demilich (Dungeons & Dragons)|demilich]]).\n\nVecna eventually recovered. On the verge of conquering Fleeth, the officials of the city came before him to beg for mercy. They offered up the entire city and her wealth if only Vecna would spare the lives of her citizens. When Vecna was not satisfied, the officials offered their own lives. Vecna gave one of their number, Artau, and his family, over to his lieutenant, [[Kas the Bloody-Handed|Kas]], who spent the entire day torturing and murdering them before the other officials. Still unsatisfied, Vecna slaughtered all within the city, and had their heads stacked before the officials, with those of their family members prominent. Vecna then granted his mercy, granting the officials leave to depart, and promising them his protection for the rest of their lives.\n\nAt his empire's height, Vecna was betrayed and destroyed by his most trusted lieutenant, a vampire called [[Kas the Bloody-Handed]], using a magical sword that Vecna himself had crafted for him, now known as the [[Sword of Kas]]. Only his left hand and his eye survived the battle, perhaps because of the previous events in Fleeth.\n\nVecna did not stay gone forever, and rose as a [[demigod]] of magic and secrets in the world of [[Greyhawk]]. In 581 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]], his cult helped set events in motion that would have granted him the power of a [[greater god]], but the plan was ultimately foiled. After these events, Vecna ended up imprisoned in the demiplane of [[Ravenloft]], but broke free again later, emerging with the power of a greater god, after absorbing the power of [[Iuz]].  He then broke free into the city of [[Planescape|Sigil]], where he came perilously close to rearranging all existence to his whims.  (Vecna's [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] shattering campaign in Sigil is used as an in-universe way to explain the differences between the 2nd and 3rd editions of ''Dungeons & Dragons.'') When Vecna was ejected from Sigil by a party of adventurers, Iuz was freed and Vecna returned to Oerth greatly reduced in power, though still a lesser god.\n\nIn the events of the [[Living Greyhawk]] campaign setting, Vecna's machinations allowed him to reappear on the prime material plane and retake his place in the Oerth pantheon.\n\n==Writings==\nAt some point in his history, Vecna penned a tome known as ''Ordinary Necromancy''. He is also rumored to have made significant additions to the ''Book of Vile Darkness''.\n\nAlthough not actually penned by him, ''the Book of Keeping'' (a book of Yugoloth summoning) is heavily linked with the cult of Vecna, as the cultists have the only known copies that are free of the intentional errors introduced into the book by the fiends that wrote the volume as a trap for would-be summoners.\n\n==In other media==\n{{cleanup list|section|date=October 2013}}\n* In the 1999 CRPG ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', Fall-From-Grace (a puritan succubus) asks Morte (a disembodied floating skull) \"What are you?\", to which Morte replies \"Me? I'm the head of Vecna.\"  A similar conversation between the two involves Morte saying \"It's a long story involving the head of Vecna. I don't want to talk about it.\" Grace responds with an amused \"That was you?\" Also in the same game, the ''Eye of Vecna'' is a rare item dropped by greater [[glabrezu]].<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Planescape: Torment]] | developer = [[Black Isle Studios]] | publisher = [[Interplay Entertainment]] | date = December 12, 1999 | platform = | version = }}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=October 2013}}\n* In ''[[Slash'EM]]'', the ''Hand of Vecna'' is a very useful artifact, gained after killing Vecna himself in the Chaotic Quest.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [Slash'EM Vampire] | developer = Slash'EM development team | publisher = | date = December 30, 2006 | platform = | version = 0.0.7E7F3}}</ref> Vecna himself is one of the more difficult foes in the game.\n* In [[Critical Role]], Vecna is the main villain in the last arc of the first campaign.

He is also included in the ''Player's Handbook'' as one of the deities of Greyhawk.  In both, he is listed as the god of evil secrets.  Additionally, both his hand and eye are listed as artifacts.\n\n==Description==\nVecna is usually depicted as a powerful magician resembling a desiccated corpse missing his left [[Hand of Vecna|hand]] and [[Eye of Vecna|eye]]. A constant theme in the adventures in which the character appears is Vecna's never-ending quest for power, ending, should he succeed, with Vecna as the only deity in existence.\n\n==Relationships==\nVecna has few allies, and countless enemies. In 2nd and 3rd Edition, his greatest, and perhaps only true ally is the mysterious entity known as the [[Mok'slyk|Serpent]]. In 4th edition, the Open Grave book introduces Osterneth, the Bronze Lich, as the mightiest servant of Vecna. The famed [[Cambion (Dungeons & Dragons)|cambion]] lich, [[Acererak]], once served Vecna, but the current status of their relationship is unknown. Among Vecna's staunchest foes are [[Kas the Bloody-Handed|Kas]], [[Iuz]], [[Saint Cuthbert (Dungeons & Dragons)|Saint Cuthbert]], the Lady of Pain, [[Pholtus]], and the [[Circle of Eight]]. He is also opposed by the [[Old Faith]] and the [[Silent Ones]].\n\nIn 4th edition, Vecna's main foes in the realm of death and undeath are [[Kas the Bloody-Handed|Kas]], [[Orcus (Dungeons & Dragons)|Orcus]] and the [[Raven Queen]] (though he would rather she rule the dead than Orcus). Among the gods, [[Ioun]] is something of Vecna's antithesis, for she would share with the world all the knowledge he would keep secret.\n\n==Dogma==\n\n===Scriptures===\nBeing a secretive cult, there are no real collections of Vecnan teachings. However, copies of the ''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]'' are highly prized by the cult for Vecna's role in that work's development. The ''Open Grave'' book offers the \"Scroll of Mauthereign\", which offers a twisted version of Vecna's history and tells his followers that committing evil acts is holy and righteous.\n\n==Worshippers==\nVecna's cult is very secretive, and cells have been uncovered, at various points in history, in [[Diamond Lake (Greyhawk)|Diamond Lake]], [[Greyhawk City|Greyhawk]], and [[Verbobonc]]. Temples to Vecna have also been reported in the [[Pomarj]] town of [[Highport]] and [[Erelhei-Cinlu]], the debased city at the heart of the [[Vault of the Drow]].\n\n===Hierarchy===\nEach position in Vecna's cult is named for a certain body part. At the top is Vecna himself, followed by the Voice of Vecna, which can only be filled by Vecna's manifestation.\n\nNext is the Heart of Vecna, the high priest of the cult. The last known Heart of Vecna was [[Diraq Malcinex]] of [[Ket (Greyhawk)|Ket]], who was slain by adventurers in 581 CY.\n\nImmediately below the Heart of Vecna are two bizarre monsters known as the Hand and the Eye. The [[Hand and Eye of Vecna (monsters)|Eye of Vecna]] creature appears as a slender humanoid with an eyeball for a head, whereas the [[Hand and Eye of Vecna (monsters)|Hand of Vecna]] appears as a stocky humanoid with a huge left hand where its head should be.\n\nIndividual congregations are known as organs. Each organ is led by a Thought of Vecna. Lesser priests are known as Memories of Vecna.\n\nLay members of the cult consist of the Teeth, Fingers, Blood, and Spawn of Vecna. The Teeth of Vecna are made up of [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|wizards]], and specialize in arcane spellcasting and crafting magical items for the cult. The Fingers of Vecna consist mainly of [[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|thieves]], who engage in various forms of subterfuge. The Blood of Vecna are mainly [[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|warriors]] charged with protection and enforcement of the cult and its goals. The Spawn of Vecna are the lowest in the cult hierarchy, and consist of the common people who honor the Lich Lord.\n\nIn 4th edition, the ''Open Grave'' book shows the leader of the cult of Vecna is a lich named Mauthereign. Even when Osterneth, the Bronze Lich, is Vecna's mightiest servant, her position is not revealed among his files.\n\n===Other Vecnan organizations===\nOther Vecnan organizations are known to exist outside of the mainstream cult, and some may have similar or identical names. Relations between these groups and the mainstream cult may vary. Known examples are the Eyes of Vecna (a cult of undeath consisting mainly of rogues), the Fingers of Vecna (Vecna's personal guard), and the [[Ebon Triad]] (a heretical cult seeking to merge Vecna, [[Hextor]], and [[Erythnul]] into a single entity).\n\nIn 4th edition, a secret group known as the Keepers of the Forbidden Lore is devoted to Vecna. Unlike most Vecna worshippers, the Keepers reject most of the nasty and evil rituals and beliefs associated with the god; they worship him as the God of Secrets, and believe that there is some knowledge too evil for the world to know. They instead hunt down secrets and information they deem to be too dangerous for the world at large and keep it secret in the name of Vecna. This puts them in opposition to mainstream followers of Vecna who regard the Keepers as heretics, and makes them enemies of Ioun and her followers, who believe all knowledge should be available for everybody and the moral obligations on how to use it rest on the shoulders of the individuals involved.\n\n==Artifacts==\n[[File:VecnaLivesCover.jpg|thumb|The Hand and Eye of Vecna, as shown on the cover of ''[[Vecna Lives!]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1990)]]\n\n===''Hand'' and ''Eye of Vecna''===\nThe left hand and eye of Vecna's original \"mortal\" lich form, which have never been replaced in his later more powerful incarnations, are now high-valued and very dangerous magical [[Magic item (Dungeons & Dragons)#Artifacts|artifacts]].<ref name=\"GDR\"/> To use the powers of the Hand of Vecna or the Eye of Vecna one is required to cut off one's own corresponding body part and affix Vecna's in its place.  These artifacts were introduced in the third supplement to the original D&D rules, ''[[Eldritch Wizardry]]''.  They went on to appear in all subsequent D&D editions.  They are considered classic items in D&D,<ref name=\"GDR\"/> with Mordicai Knode of [[Tor.com]] commenting \"We all agree that the ''Hand and Eye of Vecna'' are the best artifacts, right?\"<ref>http://www.tor.com/2013/05/23/adad-the-old-firm/</ref>\n\n===''Sword of Kas''===\nVecna created the ''[[Sword of Kas]]'' for his greatest servant, which contains a \"portion of his consciousness.\"\n\nThis interpretation is relatively recent. As per the 1st edition ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', Vecna only procured this most powerful sword for his chief lieutenant. Similarly, depending on edition and source, its appearance has varied, from a short sword to a wavy bladed two hander. However, it is undoubtable that the ''Sword'' is inextricably tied to Vecna's relics.\n\n===Other artifacts===\nA number of Vecna's other body parts are presented as minor artifacts in ''[[Die Vecna Die!]]'', including the ''First Digit'' (right thumb), ''Second Digit'' (right index finger), ''Third Digit'' (right middle finger), ''Last Digit'' (right pinky finger), ''Incisors'' (a pair of inappropriately named fang-like canines), ''Molar'', ''Scalp'', ''Skin'', ''Heart'', ''Foot'' (left), and ''Right Eye''. These artifacts are collectively known in D&D 3rd Edition as the ''Fragments of Vecna''. The ''Compendium Maleficarum'' is a book of spells, doctrines, and secrets crafted entirely from bone (even the pages) and penned in blood, that is on par with the ''Fragments of Vecna''. The ''Tome of Shared Secrets'' is an illustrated bestiary of relic status, with the ability to impart knowledge of dark and evil creatures at the cost of a portion the user's life force. Those two books were superseded in 5th edition by a combined ''Book of Vile Darkness'', a legacy of dark secrets started by Vecna. The ''Rod of the Whispered One'', while not nearly so powerful as the ''Sword of Kas'', is another item Vecna crafted to connect himself with his highest lieutenants. The final issue of Dragon Magazine, issue #359, featured rules for the \"Left Ear of Vecna\" as a minor artifact. It grants the owner magical bonuses to hearing and resisting sonic attacks, spell-like abilities to inflict deafness, grant clairaudience and create sonic blasts, and enables them to understand any spoken language. A lich known as Osterneth possesses the \"Heart of Vecna\" according to the ''Open Grave'' sourcebook.\n\n===''Head of Vecna''===\nThe ''Head of Vecna'' was a hoax that one adventuring party played on another in a campaign run by [[game master]] Mark Steuer.  One of the groups tricked the other into going on a quest for the ''Head of Vecna'', a hoax [[Magic item (Dungeons & Dragons)#Artifacts|artifact]] that was supposedly similar to his ''Hand'' and ''Eye'', but was simply an ordinary severed head.  The hoax takes advantage of the fact that the ''Eye'' and ''Hand'' require a person to remove their own eye or hand and replace it with the artifact to function.  The characters involved in the story reasoned that they needed to decapitate themselves to gain the powers of the Head of Vecna, and several members of the group actually fought over which character would get to have his head cut off and replaced.  After the third character died, the joke was revealed.<ref>[http://www.sjgames.com/ill/1996/ill-dec96.html ''Daily Illuminator'', December 6, 1996]</ref>\n\nThe ''Head of Vecna'' was later mentioned by Morte, a floating skull in ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', when discussing his lack of a body, made a [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] appearance in the 2000 AD&D campaign ''[[Die Vecna Die!]]'', and was the subject of a short adventure on the Wizards of the Coast website in 2007.<ref>[http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/oa/20070401a The Head of Vecna: A D&D Adventure for Characters Levels 1\u201312]</ref>\n\nFamiliarity with the ''Head of Vecna'' was cited as an example characteristic of an avid role-playing gamer by writer [[David M. Ewalt]].<ref name=ODaM>{{cite book | first=David M. | last=Ewalt | authorlink= David M. Ewalt | year=2013 | title= Of Dice and Men: The Story of Dungeons & Dragons and the People Who Play It | publisher=Scribner | page=1 | isbn=978-1-4516-4052-6 }}</ref>\n\n==Character history==\nVecna was born as a human, centuries ago as a member of the untouchable caste in the [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]] city of Fleeth on [[Oerth]]. He was initially trained by his mother, Mazzel, in the art of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], before she was executed by the government of Fleeth for practicing witchcraft. Vowing revenge, Vecna eventually assumed a mastery of the dark arts achieved by no mortal before or since. Some say this achievement was due to direct tutelage by  [[Mok'slyk]] the Serpent, believed to be the personification of arcane magic itself.\n\nNearly one thousand years after his birth, Vecna, now a [[Lich (Dungeons & Dragons)|lich]] and ruler of a great and terrible empire (in the [[Sheldomar Valley]], centered near the modern-day [[Rushmoors]]), laid siege to the city of Fleeth with an army of arcane spellcasters and undead. Legend has it that Vecna was nearly slain in this battle by clerics channeling the power of [[Pholtus]], the god of light. The clerics unleashed a great burst of light, which hit Vecna primarily on his left side. Vecna was rescued and brought to safety by one of his wizard generals, a cambion named [[Acererak]] (who would one day himself become a mighty [[Demilich (Dungeons & Dragons)|demilich]]).\n\nVecna eventually recovered. On the verge of conquering Fleeth, the officials of the city came before him to beg for mercy. They offered up the entire city and her wealth if only Vecna would spare the lives of her citizens. When Vecna was not satisfied, the officials offered their own lives. Vecna gave one of their number, Artau, and his family, over to his lieutenant, [[Kas the Bloody-Handed|Kas]], who spent the entire day torturing and murdering them before the other officials. Still unsatisfied, Vecna slaughtered all within the city, and had their heads stacked before the officials, with those of their family members prominent. Vecna then granted his mercy, granting the officials leave to depart, and promising them his protection for the rest of their lives.\n\nAt his empire's height, Vecna was betrayed and destroyed by his most trusted lieutenant, a vampire called [[Kas the Bloody-Handed]], using a magical sword that Vecna himself had crafted for him, now known as the [[Sword of Kas]]. Only his left hand and his eye survived the battle, perhaps because of the previous events in Fleeth.\n\nVecna did not stay gone forever, and rose as a [[demigod]] of magic and secrets in the world of [[Greyhawk]]. In 581 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]], his cult helped set events in motion that would have granted him the power of a [[greater god]], but the plan was ultimately foiled. After these events, Vecna ended up imprisoned in the demiplane of [[Ravenloft]], but broke free again later, emerging with the power of a greater god, after absorbing the power of [[Iuz]].  He then broke free into the city of [[Planescape|Sigil]], where he came perilously close to rearranging all existence to his whims.  (Vecna's [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] shattering campaign in Sigil is used as an in-universe way to explain the differences between the 2nd and 3rd editions of ''Dungeons & Dragons.'') When Vecna was ejected from Sigil by a party of adventurers, Iuz was freed and Vecna returned to Oerth greatly reduced in power, though still a lesser god.\n\nIn the events of the [[Living Greyhawk]] campaign setting, Vecna's machinations allowed him to reappear on the prime material plane and retake his place in the Oerth pantheon.\n\n==Writings==\nAt some point in his history, Vecna penned a tome known as ''Ordinary Necromancy''. He is also rumored to have made significant additions to the ''Book of Vile Darkness''.\n\nAlthough not actually penned by him, ''the Book of Keeping'' (a book of Yugoloth summoning) is heavily linked with the cult of Vecna, as the cultists have the only known copies that are free of the intentional errors introduced into the book by the fiends that wrote the volume as a trap for would-be summoners.\n\n==In other media==\n{{cleanup list|section|date=October 2013}}\n* In the 1999 CRPG ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', Fall-From-Grace (a puritan succubus) asks Morte (a disembodied floating skull) \"What are you?\", to which Morte replies \"Me? I'm the head of Vecna.\"  A similar conversation between the two involves Morte saying \"It's a long story involving the head of Vecna. I don't want to talk about it.\" Grace responds with an amused \"That was you?\" Also in the same game, the ''Eye of Vecna'' is a rare item dropped by greater [[glabrezu]].<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Planescape: Torment]] | developer = [[Black Isle Studios]] | publisher = [[Interplay Entertainment]] | date = December 12, 1999 | platform = | version = }}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=October 2013}}\n* In ''[[Slash'EM]]'', the ''Hand of Vecna'' is a very useful artifact, gained after killing Vecna himself in the Chaotic Quest.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [Slash'EM Vampire] | developer = Slash'EM development team | publisher = | date = December 30, 2006 | platform = | version = 0.0.7E7F3}}</ref> Vecna himself is one of the more difficult foes in the game.\n* In [[Critical Role]], Vecna is the main villain in the last arc of the first campaign.

The attacks against the isolated islands on 14 and 15 June 1945 were conducted to provide combat experience for the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Implacable|R86|6}} and several of the fleet's [[cruiser]]s and [[destroyer]]s ahead of their involvement in more demanding operations off the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese home islands]].\n\nOn 14 June 1945 British aircraft conducted a series of raids against Japanese positions at Truk. The next morning, several islands were bombarded by British and Canadian cruisers, though only one of the four warships involved achieved any success. Further [[Airstrike|air strikes]] took place in the afternoon and night of 15 June before the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] force returned to its base.\n\nThe attack on Truk was considered successful for the Allied force, with the ships and air units gaining useful experience while suffering two fatalities and the loss of seven aircraft to combat and accidents. The damage to the Japanese facilities in the atoll, which had been repeatedly attacked during 1944 and 1945, was modest.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was formed in November 1944 as Britain's main contribution to Allied operations against Japanese positions in the Pacific. The Fleet's base was established at [[Sydney]] in Australia, and most of its ships arrived there in February 1945. From late March to late May 1945, aircraft flying from the BPF's four [[fleet carrier]]s frequently attacked Japanese airfields on islands to the south of [[Okinawa]] to support the United States military forces which were [[Battle of Okinawa|attempting to capture the island]]. These operations concluded on 24 May, when the Fleet began the long journey back to Sydney for a period of rest and maintenance.<ref>{{cite web|title=The British Pacific Fleet|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/history/feature-histories/british-pacific-fleet|publisher=Royal Australian Navy|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe fleet carrier HMS ''Implacable'' was dispatched from the United Kingdom in February 1945 to reinforce the BPF. The ship arrived at Sydney on 8 May.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=200}} On 24 May ''Implacable'' departed Sydney, and reached the BPF's forward base at [[Manus Island]] five days later. The main body of the BPF arrived at Manus to refuel on 30 May, and most of its ships continued to Sydney on 1 June. ''Implacable'' remained at Manus, which she and her air group used as a base for intensive training.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=200}} As part of the preparations for the BPF's return to combat, Vice-Admiral [[Bernard Rawlings (Royal Navy officer)|Bernard Rawlings]] \u2013 the commander of the fleet's combat force \u2013 decided at around this time to dispatch ''Implacable'' and several other recently arrived warships to attack the Japanese positions at Truk. The purpose of this operation was to ensure that the warships' crews had recent combat experience before the BPF commenced operations off Japan during July.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=200}} Rawlings' initial orders for the attack specified that it was to involve two days of air strikes against Japanese airfields.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=203}} The crews of the ships involved, including ''Implacable''{{'}}s aircraft pilots, were not told that the operation was being undertaken for training purposes.{{sfn|Winton|1969|p=164}}\n\nDuring the early years of the [[Pacific War]], Truk Atoll in the [[Caroline Islands]] had been an important base for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN), using facilities which had been constructed there before the outbreak of hostilities. However, it was isolated by the rapid Allied advances in the Pacific during 1943 and early 1944, and ceased to be a significant base after being heavily attacked by the [[United States Navy|United States Navy's]] [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] during [[Operation Hailstone]] in February 1944.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|pp=200\u2013202}} Nevertheless, the facilities at Truk could have potentially been  used to raid the important Allied facilities which had been established in the [[Mariana Islands]] or the major US Navy anchorage at [[Ulithi]].{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=202}} To prevent the islands from being used for this purpose, they were repeatedly attacked by US Navy aircraft carriers which were preparing to join the Fast Carrier Task Force and [[United States Army Air Forces]] heavy bomber units; like the British operation in June 1945, these raids were conducted to provide combat experience for the American airmen.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=202}}{{sfn|Rottman|2002|p=414}} The Japanese forces at Truk conscripted local civilians to rapidly repair the damage caused to airfields by these raids. The garrison's anti-aircraft units also fired upon all of the raids, though the scale of this resistance decreased over time.{{sfn|Poyer|2008|pp=229, 231}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n\nIn mid-1945 the Japanese garrison at Truk remained large, but had no offensive capacity. As of May that year, the garrison comprised around 13,600 [[Imperial Japanese Army]] personnel commanded by Lieutenant General [[Shunzaburo Mugikura]] and 10,600 IJN personnel under Vice Admiral [[Chuichi Hara]].{{sfn|Rottman|2002|p=414}} A large number of [[coastal artillery]] batteries and anti-aircraft guns protected the islands, but no warships and only a small number of aircraft were stationed there.{{sfn|Royal Navy|1995|p=207}}{{sfn|Vincent|1995|p=78}}{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|pp=203, 205}}{{sfn|United States Strategic Bombing Survey|1947|pp=3, 7}} [[Radar]] stations on the islands provided warning of most incoming raids. The Japanese forces regarded Truk's air defences as inadequate even before the start of the Allied bombardment of the atoll.{{sfn|United States Strategic Bombing Survey|1947|p=7}}\n[[File:HMS Implacable arriving at Sydney on 8 May 1945.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photo of a Second World War-era aircraft carrier in front of a steel through arched bridge. Several other ships are visible near the aircraft carrier|HMS ''Implacable'' arriving at Sydney on 8 May 1945]]\n\nThe Truk garrison received few shipments of reinforcements or supplies following the capture of the [[Palau]] islands by US forces in September 1944. Historian David Hobbs has stated that it had been \"reduced to starving impotence\" by the time of Operation Inmate.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=202}} The garrison's main activity from mid-1944 onwards was growing food to sustain itself. The tropical conditions and damage caused by air attacks complicated this effort, and most of the Japanese personnel were malnourished.{{sfn|Peattie|1988|p=304}} Nevertheless, the garrison also took extensive measures to protect the atoll from invasion and placed large stores of food and other supplies in reserve for such an eventuality. Following the end of the war in August 1945, United States forces found that the garrison still held enough ammunition to supply its gun batteries for at least 30 days of combat.{{sfn|Blackton|1946|pp=403\u2013404}}\n\nThe BPF's Truk attack force was designated Task Group 111.2, and comprised the [[4th Cruiser Squadron]] and 24th Destroyer Flotilla. The ships assigned to the 4th Cruiser Squadron were ''Implacable'', the escort carrier {{HMS|Ruler|D72|6}}, the British cruisers {{HMS|Swiftsure|08|6}} and {{HMS|Newfoundland|59|2}}, the Canadian cruiser [[HMS Uganda (66)|HMCS ''Uganda'']] and the New Zealand cruiser [[HMNZS Achilles (70)|HMNZS ''Achilles'']]. The 24th Destroyer Flotilla was made up of {{HMS|Troubridge|R00|2}},  {{HMS|Teazer|R23|2}}, {{HMS|Tenacious|R45|2}}, {{HMS|Termagant|R89|2}} and {{HMS|Terpsichore|R33|2}}. The Task Group was commanded from ''Implacable'' by Rear Admiral [[Patrick Brind|E.J.P. Brind]]. While ''Implacable'', ''Newfoundland'' and the destroyers had only recently arrived in the Pacific, all the other ships assigned to Task Group 111.2 had seen combat off Okinawa.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=199}} ''Implacable''{{'}}s most recent combat experience was a series of air strikes conducted against German forces in Norway during late 1944.{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=163}}\n\n''Implacable'' embarked 80 aircraft, which was the largest number to be operated by any of the BPF's aircraft carriers. The air group included 38 Naval Air Wing, whose [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801]] and [[880 Naval Air Squadron]]s were equipped with 48 [[Supermarine Seafire]] fighter aircraft. The other units assigned to the carrier were [[828 Naval Air Squadron]] with 21 [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] torpedo bombers and [[1771 Naval Air Squadron]], which operated 11 [[Fairey Firefly]] fighters.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=203}} ''Ruler'' was to be used as a  \"spare deck\" for ''Implacable''{{'}}s air group to operate from, and embarked only a single [[Supermarine Walrus]] search and rescue aircraft from [[1701 Naval Air Squadron]].{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=203}}{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=100}}\n\n==Attacks==\n\n===14 June===\n[[File:Rockets from Firefly aircraft being fired at Moen Radio Station during Operation Inmate.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white aerial photo of a multi-story building with a tall mast next to it.

While en route to Truk, its orders were broadened to also include a cruiser bombardment of Japanese positions at Truk. This change was made as the cruisers were expected to be used against shore targets during future operations.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=203}} In preparation for these bombardments, the Task Group conducted gunnery exercises during its voyage north.{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=163}} Ahead of the attacks on Truk, a US Navy submarine took up position near the atoll to rescue any British airmen who crashed into the sea.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=207}}\n\nThe Allied warships reached the flying-off position for ''Implacable''{{'}}s air group at 5:30 am on 14 June. Ten minutes later, twelve Seafires and two Fireflies were launched. The Seafires strafed a radar station and an airfield on [[Weno|Moen]] island, and the Fireflies reconnoitred the atoll. A Seafire equipped with a reconnaissance camera also photographed Japanese installations; these photos were used to plan further air attacks and bombardments.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=203}} One of the Seafires was shot down while attacking the airfield, resulting in the death of its pilot. This was the only British aircraft to be lost in combat during Operation Inmate.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=211}}\n\n''Implacable'' launched strikes every two and a quarter hours for the remainder of 14 June. These generally comprised five Avengers armed with bombs and four Fireflies with rockets and cannon. The final attack of the day was made by twelve Seafires which dive-bombed fuel tanks on Moen island. While several of the tanks were cracked open, it appeared that they were empty.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=203}} This attack was the first time that Seafires had been used as fighter bombers in the Pacific.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=211}} The British aircraft were fired on by Japanese anti-aircraft guns throughout the day, and reported finding few worthwhile targets.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=205}} All of the strikes were escorted by Seafires, but no Japanese aircraft were encountered in the air.{{sfn|Royal Navy|1995|p=208}} During the night of 14/15 June two Avengers operated over the atoll in an attempt to prevent the Japanese from repairing the airfield on Moen; these aircraft were fired on and tracked by [[searchlight]]s but did not suffer any casualties.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=205}}\n\nEight Seafires at a time from 38 Naval Air Wing patrolled over Task Group 111.2 for much of 14 June without encountering Japanese aircraft. ''Ruler'' was used as the base for this task, and refuelled and rearmed Seafires between sorties.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|pp=203\u2013205}} The use of the escort carrier as a \"spare deck\" was considered successful, especially as a group of six Seafires which were low on fuel were able to land on ''Ruler'' when ''Implacable'' was caught in a squall and became unable to receive them.{{sfn|Royal Navy|1995|p=208}}  During the morning of 14 June ''Ruler''{{'}}s Walrus was blown overboard by a tropical squall and destroyed. Aerial search and rescue support for the force was provided by US Navy [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] flying boats which flew in relay near Truk,{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|pp=205\u2013207}} but these aircraft were not required; destroyers were able to rescue the crews of ditched aircraft.{{sfn|Royal Navy|1995|p=208}}\n\n===15 June===\n\nThe surface bombardment took place during the late morning of 15 June. The bombardment force was organised into three task units comprising both cruisers and destroyers; ''Achilles'' and ''Uganda'' (with Brind embarked) operated with ''Tenacious'', ''Newfoundland'' was accompanied by ''Troubridge'' and ''Swiftsure'' by ''Teazer''. This left the aircraft carriers with only two destroyers for protection. Each task unit was also assigned two Seafires to [[Artillery observer|spot]] their gunfire.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=164}} The destroyers which were assigned to the bombardment task units were responsible for [[counter-battery fire]] on any Japanese guns which fired on the cruiser, and for generating [[smoke screen]]s if necessary.{{sfn|Winton|1969|p=166}} Throughout the bombardments the carriers sailed {{convert|10|mi|km}} to the east of Truk, and maintained a combat air patrol over the area.{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=164}}\n[[File:NPS Truk-lagoon.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=Black and white map of Truk Lagoon, showing the location of some of the islands referred to in the article|A map of Truk Lagoon]]\n\nThe cruisers experienced differing levels of success. ''Newfoundland'' initially attacked coastal gun batteries, but these did not fire on her or her escorting destroyer. She also successfully bombarded the airfield on [[Eten Island]].{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=207}} The attacks by ''Achilles'' and ''Uganda'' on a seaplane base on [[Tonowas|Dublon Island]] did not cause any damage and were marred by communications problems between the ships and their spotting Seafires.{{sfn|Royal Navy|1995|p=208}}{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=207}} As ''Achilles'' sailed away from Truk, the cruiser's anti-aircraft gunners fired on two aircraft which approached her from the direction of the atoll until they were identified as British Avengers.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=389}}\n\n''Swiftsure''{{'}}s bombardment of Moen was particularly unsuccessful. The initial rounds fired by her guns landed well away from their targets, and attempts to correct her gunfire led to a further deterioration in accuracy. Her gunnery officer judged that the ship's fire control equipment was defective, and ordered the {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} gun turrets to fire under local control. This also proved unsuccessful as the gunners were unable to sight targets on the shore. After sailing closer to Moen, the ship attempted to engage Japanese positions with several of her {{convert|4|in|cm|adj=on}} guns. However, the ammunition for these weapons was fitted with [[proximity fuse]]s intended for use against aircraft, and exploded in the palm trees above her targets. As the fallen foliage camouflaged the Japanese positions further attacks were ineffective.{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=165}}{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|pp=207\u2013208}} A subsequent investigation found that a faulty [[split pin]] had fallen out of ''Swiftsure''{{'}}s [[Admiralty Fire Control Table]], most likely due to concussion from the initial shots, causing it to provide greatly inaccurate results to the guns.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=208}} After the bombardment ended at 11:10 am, the ships involved rejoined the carriers.{{sfn|Royal Navy|1995|p=208}}\n\nFurther air attacks were conducted on 15 June. During the afternoon, two groups of Avengers attacked a floating [[dry dock]] and several oil tanks. That night six Avengers armed with bombs supported by two flare-dropping Avengers conducted the final British attack on Truk, but it is believed that most of their bombs landed in the sea. This was the BPF's first large-scale night operation.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=209}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Three aircraft carriers of the British Pacific Fleet off Japan on 10 July 1945.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white photograph with the deck of an aircraft carrier in the foreground and two other aircraft carriers in the background|HMS ''Implacable'' (at back right) and {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} viewed from {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}} on 10 July 1945]]\n\nAt the conclusion of the night strike Task Group 111.2 departed for Manus Island. On 16 June a Japanese aircraft was detected by radar. One of the Seafires was detached from the combat air patrol to intercept it, but the fighter's pilot had to abandon the attempt due to a mechanical problem. The Task Group arrived at Manus Island on 17 June, and continued training exercises there until the remainder of the BPF arrived on 4 July en route to further operations off Japan.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|pp=210, 253}} All of the warships at Manus sailed on 6 July to join the Fast Carrier Task Force in [[Air raids on Japan#Naval air attacks|attacks on the Japanese home islands]].{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=254}} ''Implacable'' and the other ships of the BPF operated against Japan from 17 July to 12 August, during which time the Fleet conducted air attacks and participated in [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|several bombardments]] of coastal Japanese cities. On 12 August most of the BPF's ships, including ''Implacable'', departed for a period of maintenance and rest at Sydney.{{sfn|Hobbs|2012|pp=73\u201375}}{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=288}}\n\nA new Task Group 111.2 was formed by the BPF at Sydney on 12 August 1945. This force comprised the veteran aircraft carrier {{HMS|Indomitable|92|6}}, three newly arrived [[1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier|light fleet carriers]], two battleships, two or three cruisers and nine destroyers.{{sfn|Robb-Webb|2013|p=69}} These ships were intended to reinforce the BPF for the [[Operation Olympic|planned invasion of Japan]], but lacked recent combat experience. Consideration was given to using the force to attack Truk again, with this operation possibly also including an invasion of the atoll by Australian or New Zealand forces, but this came to nothing as the war ended with Japan's decision to surrender on 15 August.{{sfn|Robb-Webb|2013|p=70}}\n\nUnited States air units regularly attacked Truk until the end of the war.{{sfn|United States Strategic Bombing Survey|1947|p=15}} The atoll's garrison formally surrendered at a ceremony conducted on board {{USS|Portland|CA-33|6}} on 2 September 1945, the same day as the [[Surrender of Japan|general Japanese surrender documents]] were signed.{{sfn|Blackton|1946|p=407}} The Japanese soldiers and sailors were repatriated from Truk during November and December 1945.{{sfn|Peattie|1988|p=310}}\n\n==Assessment==\n\nDuring Operation Inmate, Task Group 111.2's aircraft flew 103 offensive sorties during daylight and a further 10 at night. A total of 103 defensive sorties were also conducted.{{sfn|Royal Navy|1995|p=209}} In addition to the Seafire shot down on 14 June and the loss of ''Ruler''{{'}}s Walrus, five Avengers were destroyed due to accidents while taking off; one of these aircraft crashed into the sea due to an error in attaching it to ''Implacable''{{'}}s [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]], resulting in the death of its pilot. The other four Avengers ditched due to engine malfunctions, with no fatalities. Two Seafires, both piloted by the same airman, were also damaged in landing accidents.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=211}} A book published to mark the 50th anniversary of the BPF described these losses as low by the standards of 1945.{{sfn|Vincent|1995|p=79}}\n\nJapanese losses were modest. The British assessed that two Japanese aircraft had been destroyed and another three damaged during attacks on airfields at Truk. Damage was also believed to have been inflicted on the airfields, floating dry dock, oil tanks, other harbour installations and ships that were attacked.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=211}} Following the operation, Brind assessed that rockets had proven more useful than bombs, and was critical of the gunnery of all the cruisers other than ''Newfoundland''.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|pp=209, 211}} Members of the Japanese garrison told [[United States Strategic Bombing Survey|US Strategic Bombing Survey]] investigators after the war that the British raid had resulted in practically no damage. The most significant loss was the destruction of part of the garrison's records, which led to a decision to bury the remaining files.{{sfn|United States Strategic Bombing Survey|1947|p=14}}\n\nHistorian David Hobbs has judged that Operation Inmate \"provided realistic and useful training for ships that were newly arrived in the Pacific and everyone, including ''Swiftsure''{{'}}s embarrassed gunners, ... learned something\".{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=210}} Peter C. Smith has also noted that while few targets were located, the raids provided useful experience for ''Implacable''{{'}}s air crew and \"the standards of flight launch and recovery attained during the operation were to stand them in good stead in the months ahead\".{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=165}} Similarly, British [[Official history|official historian]] [[Stephen Roskill]] concluded that Operation Inmate achieved its goals.{{sfn|Roskill|1961|p=363}}\n\n==References==\n\n===References===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Works consulted===\n* {{cite journal|last1=Blackton|first1=Charles Stuart|title=The Surrender of the Fortress of Truk|journal=Pacific Historical Review|date=1946|volume=15|issue=4|pages=400\u2013408|doi=10.2307/3635776|ref=harv|jstor=3635776}}\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=David|title=Carrier Operations in World War II|year=2009|publisher=Frontline|location=Barnsley, South Yorkshire|isbn=9781848320420|editor=Hobbs, David|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Hobbs|first1=David|title=The British Pacific Fleet: The Royal Navy's Most Powerful Strike Force|date=2011|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|isbn=9781591140443|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Hobbs|first1=David|editor1-last=Young|editor1-first=Kathryn|editor2-last=Mitchell|editor2-first=Rhett|title=The Commonwealth Navies: 100 Years of Cooperation. 2009 King\u2013Hall Naval History Conference proceedings|date=2012|publisher=Sea Power Centre \u2013 Australia|location=Canberra|isbn=9780642297686|pages=65\u201378|chapter-url=http://www.navy.gov.au/spc/sites/default/files/publication-documents/KH09-%28web%29_0.pdf|chapter=The British Pacific Fleet in 1945|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Peattie|first1=Mark R.|title=Nan'yo: The Rise and Fall of the Japanese in Micronesia, 1885\u20131945|date=1988|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=9780824814809|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Poyer|first1=Lin|title=Chuukese Experiences in the Pacific War|journal=The Journal of Pacific History|date=2008|volume=43|issue=2|pages=223\u2013238|doi=10.1080/00223340802281569|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Robb-Webb|first1=Jon|title=The British Pacific Fleet Experience and Legacy, 1944\u201350|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham, Surrey|isbn=9780754668510|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Roskill|first=S.W.|title=The War at Sea 1939\u20131945.

The attacks against the isolated islands on 14 and 15 June 1945 were conducted to provide combat experience for the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Implacable|R86|6}} and several of the fleet's [[cruiser]]s and [[destroyer]]s ahead of their involvement in more demanding operations off the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese home islands]].\n\nOn 14 June 1945 British aircraft conducted a series of raids against Japanese positions at Truk. The next morning, several islands were bombarded by British and Canadian cruisers, though only one of the four warships involved achieved any success. Further [[Airstrike|air strikes]] took place in the afternoon and night of 15 June before the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] force returned to its base.\n\nThe attack on Truk was considered successful for the Allied force, with the ships and air units gaining useful experience while suffering two fatalities and the loss of seven aircraft to combat and accidents. The damage to the Japanese facilities in the atoll, which had been repeatedly attacked during 1944 and 1945, was modest.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was formed in November 1944 as Britain's main contribution to Allied operations against Japanese positions in the Pacific. The Fleet's base was established at [[Sydney]] in Australia, and most of its ships arrived there in February 1945. From late March to late May 1945, aircraft flying from the BPF's four [[fleet carrier]]s frequently attacked Japanese airfields on islands to the south of [[Okinawa]] to support the United States military forces which were [[Battle of Okinawa|attempting to capture the island]]. These operations concluded on 24 May, when the Fleet began the long journey back to Sydney for a period of rest and maintenance.<ref>{{cite web|title=The British Pacific Fleet|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/history/feature-histories/british-pacific-fleet|publisher=Royal Australian Navy|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe fleet carrier HMS ''Implacable'' was dispatched from the United Kingdom in February 1945 to reinforce the BPF. The ship arrived at Sydney on 8 May.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=200}} On 24 May ''Implacable'' departed Sydney, and reached the BPF's forward base at [[Manus Island]] five days later. The main body of the BPF arrived at Manus to refuel on 30 May, and most of its ships continued to Sydney on 1 June. ''Implacable'' remained at Manus, which she and her air group used as a base for intensive training.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=200}} As part of the preparations for the BPF's return to combat, Vice-Admiral [[Bernard Rawlings (Royal Navy officer)|Bernard Rawlings]] \u2013 the commander of the fleet's combat force \u2013 decided at around this time to dispatch ''Implacable'' and several other recently arrived warships to attack the Japanese positions at Truk. The purpose of this operation was to ensure that the warships' crews had recent combat experience before the BPF commenced operations off Japan during July.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=200}} Rawlings' initial orders for the attack specified that it was to involve two days of air strikes against Japanese airfields.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=203}} The crews of the ships involved, including ''Implacable''{{'}}s aircraft pilots, were not told that the operation was being undertaken for training purposes.{{sfn|Winton|1969|p=164}}\n\nDuring the early years of the [[Pacific War]], Truk Atoll in the [[Caroline Islands]] had been an important base for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN), using facilities which had been constructed there before the outbreak of hostilities. However, it was isolated by the rapid Allied advances in the Pacific during 1943 and early 1944, and ceased to be a significant base after being heavily attacked by the [[United States Navy|United States Navy's]] [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] during [[Operation Hailstone]] in February 1944.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|pp=200\u2013202}} Nevertheless, the facilities at Truk could have potentially been  used to raid the important Allied facilities which had been established in the [[Mariana Islands]] or the major US Navy anchorage at [[Ulithi]].{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=202}} To prevent the islands from being used for this purpose, they were repeatedly attacked by US Navy aircraft carriers which were preparing to join the Fast Carrier Task Force and [[United States Army Air Forces]] heavy bomber units; like the British operation in June 1945, these raids were conducted to provide combat experience for the American airmen.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=202}}{{sfn|Rottman|2002|p=414}} The Japanese forces at Truk conscripted local civilians to rapidly repair the damage caused to airfields by these raids. The garrison's anti-aircraft units also fired upon all of the raids, though the scale of this resistance decreased over time.{{sfn|Poyer|2008|pp=229, 231}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n\nIn mid-1945 the Japanese garrison at Truk remained large, but had no offensive capacity. As of May that year, the garrison comprised around 13,600 [[Imperial Japanese Army]] personnel commanded by Lieutenant General [[Shunzaburo Mugikura]] and 10,600 IJN personnel under Vice Admiral [[Chuichi Hara]].{{sfn|Rottman|2002|p=414}} A large number of [[coastal artillery]] batteries and anti-aircraft guns protected the islands, but no warships and only a small number of aircraft were stationed there.{{sfn|Royal Navy|1995|p=207}}{{sfn|Vincent|1995|p=78}}{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|pp=203, 205}}{{sfn|United States Strategic Bombing Survey|1947|pp=3, 7}} [[Radar]] stations on the islands provided warning of most incoming raids. The Japanese forces regarded Truk's air defences as inadequate even before the start of the Allied bombardment of the atoll.{{sfn|United States Strategic Bombing Survey|1947|p=7}}\n[[File:HMS Implacable arriving at Sydney on 8 May 1945.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photo of a Second World War-era aircraft carrier in front of a steel through arched bridge.

Historian David Hobbs has stated that it had been \"reduced to starving impotence\" by the time of Operation Inmate.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=202}} The garrison's main activity from mid-1944 onwards was growing food to sustain itself. The tropical conditions and damage caused by air attacks complicated this effort, and most of the Japanese personnel were malnourished.{{sfn|Peattie|1988|p=304}} Nevertheless, the garrison also took extensive measures to protect the atoll from invasion and placed large stores of food and other supplies in reserve for such an eventuality. Following the end of the war in August 1945, United States forces found that the garrison still held enough ammunition to supply its gun batteries for at least 30 days of combat.{{sfn|Blackton|1946|pp=403\u2013404}}\n\nThe BPF's Truk attack force was designated Task Group 111.2, and comprised the [[4th Cruiser Squadron]] and 24th Destroyer Flotilla. The ships assigned to the 4th Cruiser Squadron were ''Implacable'', the escort carrier {{HMS|Ruler|D72|6}}, the British cruisers {{HMS|Swiftsure|08|6}} and {{HMS|Newfoundland|59|2}}, the Canadian cruiser [[HMS Uganda (66)|HMCS ''Uganda'']] and the New Zealand cruiser [[HMNZS Achilles (70)|HMNZS ''Achilles'']]. The 24th Destroyer Flotilla was made up of {{HMS|Troubridge|R00|2}},  {{HMS|Teazer|R23|2}}, {{HMS|Tenacious|R45|2}}, {{HMS|Termagant|R89|2}} and {{HMS|Terpsichore|R33|2}}. The Task Group was commanded from ''Implacable'' by Rear Admiral [[Patrick Brind|E.J.P. Brind]]. While ''Implacable'', ''Newfoundland'' and the destroyers had only recently arrived in the Pacific, all the other ships assigned to Task Group 111.2 had seen combat off Okinawa.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=199}} ''Implacable''{{'}}s most recent combat experience was a series of air strikes conducted against German forces in Norway during late 1944.{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=163}}\n\n''Implacable'' embarked 80 aircraft, which was the largest number to be operated by any of the BPF's aircraft carriers. The air group included 38 Naval Air Wing, whose [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801]] and [[880 Naval Air Squadron]]s were equipped with 48 [[Supermarine Seafire]] fighter aircraft. The other units assigned to the carrier were [[828 Naval Air Squadron]] with 21 [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] torpedo bombers and [[1771 Naval Air Squadron]], which operated 11 [[Fairey Firefly]] fighters.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=203}} ''Ruler'' was to be used as a  \"spare deck\" for ''Implacable''{{'}}s air group to operate from, and embarked only a single [[Supermarine Walrus]] search and rescue aircraft from [[1701 Naval Air Squadron]].{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=203}}{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=100}}\n\n==Attacks==\n\n===14 June===\n[[File:Rockets from Firefly aircraft being fired at Moen Radio Station during Operation Inmate.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white aerial photo of a multi-story building with a tall mast next to it. Smoke is visible in the air in front of the building.|Rockets being fired from a Firefly at the radio station on Moen island]]\nTask Group 111.2 sailed from Manus Island on 12 June. While en route to Truk, its orders were broadened to also include a cruiser bombardment of Japanese positions at Truk. This change was made as the cruisers were expected to be used against shore targets during future operations.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=203}} In preparation for these bombardments, the Task Group conducted gunnery exercises during its voyage north.{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=163}} Ahead of the attacks on Truk, a US Navy submarine took up position near the atoll to rescue any British airmen who crashed into the sea.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=207}}\n\nThe Allied warships reached the flying-off position for ''Implacable''{{'}}s air group at 5:30 am on 14 June. Ten minutes later, twelve Seafires and two Fireflies were launched. The Seafires strafed a radar station and an airfield on [[Weno|Moen]] island, and the Fireflies reconnoitred the atoll. A Seafire equipped with a reconnaissance camera also photographed Japanese installations; these photos were used to plan further air attacks and bombardments.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=203}} One of the Seafires was shot down while attacking the airfield, resulting in the death of its pilot. This was the only British aircraft to be lost in combat during Operation Inmate.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=211}}\n\n''Implacable'' launched strikes every two and a quarter hours for the remainder of 14 June. These generally comprised five Avengers armed with bombs and four Fireflies with rockets and cannon. The final attack of the day was made by twelve Seafires which dive-bombed fuel tanks on Moen island. While several of the tanks were cracked open, it appeared that they were empty.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=203}} This attack was the first time that Seafires had been used as fighter bombers in the Pacific.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=211}} The British aircraft were fired on by Japanese anti-aircraft guns throughout the day, and reported finding few worthwhile targets.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=205}} All of the strikes were escorted by Seafires, but no Japanese aircraft were encountered in the air.{{sfn|Royal Navy|1995|p=208}} During the night of 14/15 June two Avengers operated over the atoll in an attempt to prevent the Japanese from repairing the airfield on Moen; these aircraft were fired on and tracked by [[searchlight]]s but did not suffer any casualties.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=205}}\n\nEight Seafires at a time from 38 Naval Air Wing patrolled over Task Group 111.2 for much of 14 June without encountering Japanese aircraft. ''Ruler'' was used as the base for this task, and refuelled and rearmed Seafires between sorties.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|pp=203\u2013205}} The use of the escort carrier as a \"spare deck\" was considered successful, especially as a group of six Seafires which were low on fuel were able to land on ''Ruler'' when ''Implacable'' was caught in a squall and became unable to receive them.{{sfn|Royal Navy|1995|p=208}}  During the morning of 14 June ''Ruler''{{'}}s Walrus was blown overboard by a tropical squall and destroyed. Aerial search and rescue support for the force was provided by US Navy [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] flying boats which flew in relay near Truk,{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|pp=205\u2013207}} but these aircraft were not required; destroyers were able to rescue the crews of ditched aircraft.{{sfn|Royal Navy|1995|p=208}}\n\n===15 June===\n\nThe surface bombardment took place during the late morning of 15 June. The bombardment force was organised into three task units comprising both cruisers and destroyers; ''Achilles'' and ''Uganda'' (with Brind embarked) operated with ''Tenacious'', ''Newfoundland'' was accompanied by ''Troubridge'' and ''Swiftsure'' by ''Teazer''. This left the aircraft carriers with only two destroyers for protection. Each task unit was also assigned two Seafires to [[Artillery observer|spot]] their gunfire.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=164}} The destroyers which were assigned to the bombardment task units were responsible for [[counter-battery fire]] on any Japanese guns which fired on the cruiser, and for generating [[smoke screen]]s if necessary.{{sfn|Winton|1969|p=166}} Throughout the bombardments the carriers sailed {{convert|10|mi|km}} to the east of Truk, and maintained a combat air patrol over the area.{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=164}}\n[[File:NPS Truk-lagoon.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=Black and white map of Truk Lagoon, showing the location of some of the islands referred to in the article|A map of Truk Lagoon]]\n\nThe cruisers experienced differing levels of success. ''Newfoundland'' initially attacked coastal gun batteries, but these did not fire on her or her escorting destroyer. She also successfully bombarded the airfield on [[Eten Island]].{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=207}} The attacks by ''Achilles'' and ''Uganda'' on a seaplane base on [[Tonowas|Dublon Island]] did not cause any damage and were marred by communications problems between the ships and their spotting Seafires.{{sfn|Royal Navy|1995|p=208}}{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=207}} As ''Achilles'' sailed away from Truk, the cruiser's anti-aircraft gunners fired on two aircraft which approached her from the direction of the atoll until they were identified as British Avengers.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=389}}\n\n''Swiftsure''{{'}}s bombardment of Moen was particularly unsuccessful. The initial rounds fired by her guns landed well away from their targets, and attempts to correct her gunfire led to a further deterioration in accuracy. Her gunnery officer judged that the ship's fire control equipment was defective, and ordered the {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} gun turrets to fire under local control. This also proved unsuccessful as the gunners were unable to sight targets on the shore. After sailing closer to Moen, the ship attempted to engage Japanese positions with several of her {{convert|4|in|cm|adj=on}} guns. However, the ammunition for these weapons was fitted with [[proximity fuse]]s intended for use against aircraft, and exploded in the palm trees above her targets. As the fallen foliage camouflaged the Japanese positions further attacks were ineffective.{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=165}}{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|pp=207\u2013208}} A subsequent investigation found that a faulty [[split pin]] had fallen out of ''Swiftsure''{{'}}s [[Admiralty Fire Control Table]], most likely due to concussion from the initial shots, causing it to provide greatly inaccurate results to the guns.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=208}} After the bombardment ended at 11:10 am, the ships involved rejoined the carriers.{{sfn|Royal Navy|1995|p=208}}\n\nFurther air attacks were conducted on 15 June. During the afternoon, two groups of Avengers attacked a floating [[dry dock]] and several oil tanks. That night six Avengers armed with bombs supported by two flare-dropping Avengers conducted the final British attack on Truk, but it is believed that most of their bombs landed in the sea. This was the BPF's first large-scale night operation.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=209}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Three aircraft carriers of the British Pacific Fleet off Japan on 10 July 1945.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white photograph with the deck of an aircraft carrier in the foreground and two other aircraft carriers in the background|HMS ''Implacable'' (at back right) and {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} viewed from {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}} on 10 July 1945]]\n\nAt the conclusion of the night strike Task Group 111.2 departed for Manus Island. On 16 June a Japanese aircraft was detected by radar. One of the Seafires was detached from the combat air patrol to intercept it, but the fighter's pilot had to abandon the attempt due to a mechanical problem. The Task Group arrived at Manus Island on 17 June, and continued training exercises there until the remainder of the BPF arrived on 4 July en route to further operations off Japan.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|pp=210, 253}} All of the warships at Manus sailed on 6 July to join the Fast Carrier Task Force in [[Air raids on Japan#Naval air attacks|attacks on the Japanese home islands]].{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=254}} ''Implacable'' and the other ships of the BPF operated against Japan from 17 July to 12 August, during which time the Fleet conducted air attacks and participated in [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|several bombardments]] of coastal Japanese cities. On 12 August most of the BPF's ships, including ''Implacable'', departed for a period of maintenance and rest at Sydney.{{sfn|Hobbs|2012|pp=73\u201375}}{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=288}}\n\nA new Task Group 111.2 was formed by the BPF at Sydney on 12 August 1945. This force comprised the veteran aircraft carrier {{HMS|Indomitable|92|6}}, three newly arrived [[1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier|light fleet carriers]], two battleships, two or three cruisers and nine destroyers.{{sfn|Robb-Webb|2013|p=69}} These ships were intended to reinforce the BPF for the [[Operation Olympic|planned invasion of Japan]], but lacked recent combat experience. Consideration was given to using the force to attack Truk again, with this operation possibly also including an invasion of the atoll by Australian or New Zealand forces, but this came to nothing as the war ended with Japan's decision to surrender on 15 August.{{sfn|Robb-Webb|2013|p=70}}\n\nUnited States air units regularly attacked Truk until the end of the war.{{sfn|United States Strategic Bombing Survey|1947|p=15}} The atoll's garrison formally surrendered at a ceremony conducted on board {{USS|Portland|CA-33|6}} on 2 September 1945, the same day as the [[Surrender of Japan|general Japanese surrender documents]] were signed.{{sfn|Blackton|1946|p=407}} The Japanese soldiers and sailors were repatriated from Truk during November and December 1945.{{sfn|Peattie|1988|p=310}}\n\n==Assessment==\n\nDuring Operation Inmate, Task Group 111.2's aircraft flew 103 offensive sorties during daylight and a further 10 at night. A total of 103 defensive sorties were also conducted.{{sfn|Royal Navy|1995|p=209}} In addition to the Seafire shot down on 14 June and the loss of ''Ruler''{{'}}s Walrus, five Avengers were destroyed due to accidents while taking off; one of these aircraft crashed into the sea due to an error in attaching it to ''Implacable''{{'}}s [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]], resulting in the death of its pilot. The other four Avengers ditched due to engine malfunctions, with no fatalities. Two Seafires, both piloted by the same airman, were also damaged in landing accidents.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=211}} A book published to mark the 50th anniversary of the BPF described these losses as low by the standards of 1945.{{sfn|Vincent|1995|p=79}}\n\nJapanese losses were modest. The British assessed that two Japanese aircraft had been destroyed and another three damaged during attacks on airfields at Truk. Damage was also believed to have been inflicted on the airfields, floating dry dock, oil tanks, other harbour installations and ships that were attacked.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=211}} Following the operation, Brind assessed that rockets had proven more useful than bombs, and was critical of the gunnery of all the cruisers other than ''Newfoundland''.{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|pp=209, 211}} Members of the Japanese garrison told [[United States Strategic Bombing Survey|US Strategic Bombing Survey]] investigators after the war that the British raid had resulted in practically no damage. The most significant loss was the destruction of part of the garrison's records, which led to a decision to bury the remaining files.{{sfn|United States Strategic Bombing Survey|1947|p=14}}\n\nHistorian David Hobbs has judged that Operation Inmate \"provided realistic and useful training for ships that were newly arrived in the Pacific and everyone, including ''Swiftsure''{{'}}s embarrassed gunners, ... learned something\".{{sfn|Hobbs|2011|p=210}} Peter C. Smith has also noted that while few targets were located, the raids provided useful experience for ''Implacable''{{'}}s air crew and \"the standards of flight launch and recovery attained during the operation were to stand them in good stead in the months ahead\".{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=165}} Similarly, British [[Official history|official historian]] [[Stephen Roskill]] concluded that Operation Inmate achieved its goals.{{sfn|Roskill|1961|p=363}}\n\n==References==\n\n===References===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Works consulted===\n* {{cite journal|last1=Blackton|first1=Charles Stuart|title=The Surrender of the Fortress of Truk|journal=Pacific Historical Review|date=1946|volume=15|issue=4|pages=400\u2013408|doi=10.2307/3635776|ref=harv|jstor=3635776}}\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=David|title=Carrier Operations in World War II|year=2009|publisher=Frontline|location=Barnsley, South Yorkshire|isbn=9781848320420|editor=Hobbs, David|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Hobbs|first1=David|title=The British Pacific Fleet: The Royal Navy's Most Powerful Strike Force|date=2011|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|isbn=9781591140443|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Hobbs|first1=David|editor1-last=Young|editor1-first=Kathryn|editor2-last=Mitchell|editor2-first=Rhett|title=The Commonwealth Navies: 100 Years of Cooperation. 2009 King\u2013Hall Naval History Conference proceedings|date=2012|publisher=Sea Power Centre \u2013 Australia|location=Canberra|isbn=9780642297686|pages=65\u201378|chapter-url=http://www.navy.gov.au/spc/sites/default/files/publication-documents/KH09-%28web%29_0.pdf|chapter=The British Pacific Fleet in 1945|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Peattie|first1=Mark R.|title=Nan'yo: The Rise and Fall of the Japanese in Micronesia, 1885\u20131945|date=1988|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=9780824814809|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Poyer|first1=Lin|title=Chuukese Experiences in the Pacific War|journal=The Journal of Pacific History|date=2008|volume=43|issue=2|pages=223\u2013238|doi=10.1080/00223340802281569|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Robb-Webb|first1=Jon|title=The British Pacific Fleet Experience and Legacy, 1944\u201350|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham, Surrey|isbn=9780754668510|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Roskill|first=S.W.|title=The War at Sea 1939\u20131945.

The Abbasids, like the Umayyads before them, realized this as a big threat to their own caliphate, since the Shias saw them as usurpers of al-Ma'mun which was far from the sacred status of their Imams. [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei|Allamah Tabatabaei]] writes in his book [[Shi'ite Islam (book)|Shi'ite Islam]], that in order to quiet the many Shia rebellions around his government, al-Ma'mun summoned Imam al-Ridha to [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] and wanted to offer him the role of Crown Prince to prevent the Shias and relatives of al-Ridha from rebelling against the government, seeing as they would then be fighting their own Imam; secondly, to cause the people to lose their spiritual belief and inner attachment to the Imams, because the Imam would be associated with the corrupt government of al-Ma'mun.<ref name=\"shia islam\">{{cite book|last = Tabatabaei|first = Sayyid Mohammad Hosayn|authorlink = Allameh Tabatabaei|title = Shi'ite Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Be5DeNM8d1EC&pg=PA258|year = 1975|isbn = 0-87395-390-8| others=Translated by [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr|Sayyid Hossein Nasr]]|publisher=State University of New York Press}}</ref> Thirdly, he intended it to fool other Shias into believing that his government was not so bad after all, because al-Ridha would then come into power after Ma'mun. And fourthly, he wanted to keep a close watch over the Imam of the Shias himself, so that nothing could happen without al-Ma'mun's knowledge.\n\nWord spread quickly among al-Ma'mun's circles that al-Ma'mun was not sincere in his offer to make Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha the Crown Prince, and that it was simply a political move. Al-Ma'mun also became paranoid and thought that al-Ridha would see through it as well, and so would his Shias. In order to quiet the doubts of the people, al-Ma'mun first offered al-Ridha the caliphate itself. He wrote a letter to the Abbasids, who were displeased with his decision to entrust al-Ridha the seat of the caliphate, saying:\n{{quote|Al-Ma\u2019mun did not pledge allegiance to him (al-Ridha) but discerning of his affair, knowing that none on the face of earth is clearer than him in merit, more manifest than him in chastity, more pious than him in piety, more ascetic than him in renouncing the world, freer than him in soul, more pleasing than him to the special associates and the general populace, and \ufb01rmer than him in Divine essence.

In the document where he pledges allegiance to Ali al-Ridha, Ma'mun writes: <blockquote>His (al-Ma\u2019mu\u2019n\u2019s) choosing \u2018Ali b. Musa\u2019 b. Ja\u2018far b.

That is because he (al-Ma\u2019mu\u2019n) has seen his (the Imam\u2019s) brilliant excellence, his plain knowledge, his manifest piety, his pure asceticism, his renouncing the world, and his being safe from the people.

Al-Ridha said he would accept, under the condition that none of the affairs of government would be his. He would neither appoint anyone, nor dismiss. He would not rule, or pass laws. He would only be Crown Prince in name.

What kind of things are you talking about? The sons of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and [[Fatimah Zahra]] are worthy and outstanding only when they obey the command of Allah, and keep themselves away from sin and blunder. You think you are like [[Musa al-Kadhim]], [[Ali ibn Husayn]], and other [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imams]]? Whereas, they took pains and bore hardships on the way to Allah and prayed to Allah day and night. Do you think you will gain without pain? Be aware, that if a person out of us the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] performs a good deed, he gets twice the reward. Because not only he performed good deeds like others but also that he has maintained the honor of Muhammad. If he practices something bad and does a sin, he has performed two sins. One is that he performed a bad act like the rest of the people and the other one is that he has negated the honor of Muhammad. O brother! The one who obeys Allah is from us the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] and the one who is a sinner is not ours. Allah said about the son of [[Noah]] who cut the spiritual bondage with his father, \"He is not out of your lineage; if he was out of your lineage, I would have (saved) and granted him salvation.\"<ref name=\"Oyun\"/>}}\n\n==Debates==\n[[Al-Ma'mun]] was very interested in working on various sciences translated into Arabic. Thus he arranged debates between the Imam and Muslim scholars and the leaders of religion sects who came in his presence.<ref name= \"madelung\"/><ref name=\"shiite Islam\"/>\nOne of the discussions was on Divine Unity with Sulaiman al-Mervi; a scholar from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], another discussion with Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Jahm was devoted to the sinlessness of the Prophets, which led to another debate on the same subject which Ma'mun took a great part in it himself. Many of these debates are recorded in the collections of [[Shia]] [[hadith]]s, like [[Oyoun Akhbar Al-Ridha]]. The following is an example of these debates which took place between the Imam and an unbeliever([[Zind\u012bq]]).<ref name=\"chittick\"/><ref name= \"madelung\"/>\n\n(The Imam) said to him (Zind\u012bq), \"Dost thou see that if the correct view is your view then are we not equal? All that we have prayed, fasted, given of the alms and declared of our convictions will not harm us. If the correct view is our view then have not you perished and we gained salvation?\"\nthe Man said. \"Then let me know, how is He and where is He?\" Abu-l-Hasan(the Imam)answered, \"surely the opinion thou hast adopted is mistaken. He determined the 'where', and He was, when there was no 'where'; and He fashioned the 'how', and He was, when there was no 'how'. So He is not known through 'howness' or 'whereness'\" The man said, \"So then surely He is nothing if He cannot be perceived by any of the senses.\" Abu-l-Hasan said, \"when our senses fail to perceive Him, we know for certain that He is our Lord \u2026\" The man said, \"Then tell me, when was He?\" Abu-l-Hasan said, \"Tell when He was not, and then I will tell you when He was...\" The man said, \"Then why has He veiled Himself (from men)?\" Abu-l-Hasan replied, \"Surely the veil is upon creatures because of the abundance of their sins. As for Him, no secret is hidden from Him during the day or the night\u2026\"\n\nThis is a long debate, entitled, ''The Veil'', full text of which could be found in the ''A Shiite Anthology'' translated by [[William Chittick]].<ref name=\"chittick\"/> According to some accounts, Ma'mun's main objective of holding the meetings was a hope to render the Imam incapable of answering questions in order to undermine his popularity. It is related from al-Nawfali who quoted the Imam as saying\n\n<blockquote>Would you (al-Nawfali) like to know when al-Ma'm\u016bn will feel remorseful? ...When he hears me argue with the people of the Torah quoting their own Torah, with the people of the Gospel quoting their own Gospel, with the people of the Psalms quoting their own Psalms, with the Zoroastrians arguing in their Persian language, with the Romans in their own Latin... then al-Ma'm\u016bn will realize that he will not achieve what he aspires...<ref name=\"al-Qarashi\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:QoranQomMuseum.jpg|thumb|300px|A version of the [[Quran]] written by Al-Ridha, now in the [[Qom]] Museum, [[Iran]]]]\n\n==Works==\n\n===Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah===\n{{Main|Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah}}\n[[Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah]] (The Golden Treatise) is a treatise on medical cures and the maintenance of good health which is said to have been written in accordance with the demand of [[al-Ma'mun|Ma'mun]].<ref name= \"madelung\"/><ref name=\"al islam\">{{cite book |last= Muhammad Jawad Fadlallah |date= |title= Imam ar-Ridha', A Historical and Biographical Research |url=http://www.al-islam.org/imam-ar-ridha-a-historical-and-biographical-research-muhammad-jawad-fadlallah|others=Yasin T.

After finally being able to persuade al-Rida to accept this position, al-Ma'mun realized his mistake, for Shia began to gain even more popularity. Moreover, Arab party in [[Baghdad]] were furious when they heard that al-Ma'mun not only appointed the imam as his successor, but sent out commands that the [[Abbasid]]'d black flag should be changed to green in honor of the Imam. They were afraid that the empire would be taken from them. They got together, therefore, to depose Ma'mun and give allegiance to [[Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi]], who was the uncle of Ma'mun.<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/> When Ma'mun heard this, the Imam advised him to solve the problem by dismissing him from his position but he did not heed and decided to return to [[Baghdad]] and assert his rights.<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/> However, when they reached the town of [[Sarakhs]], his vizier was assassinated, and when they reached [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], al-Ma'm\u016bn poisoned the Imam. Then, Muhammad Taqi imam's son came.

According to [[Wilferd Madelung|Madelung]] the unexpected death of both the vizier and the successor, \"whose presence would have made any reconciliation with the powerful \u02bfAbbasid opposition in Baghdad virtually impossible, must indeed arouse strong suspicion that Ma'mun had had a hand in the deaths.\"<ref name= \"madelung\"/><ref name=\"al-Qarashi\"/> The more popular record about his death is that he died in 203 AH, at the age of 50.

The Caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]] sought out a remedy for this problem by appointing Al-Ridha as his successor, through whom he could be involved in worldly affairs. However, according to the Shia view, when Al-Ma'mun saw that the Imam gained even more popularity, he decided to correct his mistake by poisoning him.

However, in the Shia sources he is commonly called ''Abu'l-\u1e24asan al-\u1e6e\u0101n\u012b'' (the second Abu'l Hasan), since his father, [[Musa al-Kadhim]], was also Abu'l Hasan (he was known as ''Abu'l-\u1e24asan al-Awwal'', meaning the first Abu'l Hasan).

The Abbasids, like the Umayyads before them, realized this as a big threat to their own caliphate, since the Shias saw them as usurpers of al-Ma'mun which was far from the sacred status of their Imams. [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei|Allamah Tabatabaei]] writes in his book [[Shi'ite Islam (book)|Shi'ite Islam]], that in order to quiet the many Shia rebellions around his government, al-Ma'mun summoned Imam al-Ridha to [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] and wanted to offer him the role of Crown Prince to prevent the Shias and relatives of al-Ridha from rebelling against the government, seeing as they would then be fighting their own Imam; secondly, to cause the people to lose their spiritual belief and inner attachment to the Imams, because the Imam would be associated with the corrupt government of al-Ma'mun.<ref name=\"shia islam\">{{cite book|last = Tabatabaei|first = Sayyid Mohammad Hosayn|authorlink = Allameh Tabatabaei|title = Shi'ite Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Be5DeNM8d1EC&pg=PA258|year = 1975|isbn = 0-87395-390-8| others=Translated by [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr|Sayyid Hossein Nasr]]|publisher=State University of New York Press}}</ref> Thirdly, he intended it to fool other Shias into believing that his government was not so bad after all, because al-Ridha would then come into power after Ma'mun. And fourthly, he wanted to keep a close watch over the Imam of the Shias himself, so that nothing could happen without al-Ma'mun's knowledge.\n\nWord spread quickly among al-Ma'mun's circles that al-Ma'mun was not sincere in his offer to make Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha the Crown Prince, and that it was simply a political move. Al-Ma'mun also became paranoid and thought that al-Ridha would see through it as well, and so would his Shias. In order to quiet the doubts of the people, al-Ma'mun first offered al-Ridha the caliphate itself. He wrote a letter to the Abbasids, who were displeased with his decision to entrust al-Ridha the seat of the caliphate, saying:\n{{quote|Al-Ma\u2019mun did not pledge allegiance to him (al-Ridha) but discerning of his affair, knowing that none on the face of earth is clearer than him in merit, more manifest than him in chastity, more pious than him in piety, more ascetic than him in renouncing the world, freer than him in soul, more pleasing than him to the special associates and the general populace, and \ufb01rmer than him in Divine essence.

In the document where he pledges allegiance to Ali al-Ridha, Ma'mun writes: <blockquote>His (al-Ma\u2019mu\u2019n\u2019s) choosing \u2018Ali b. Musa\u2019 b. Ja\u2018far b.

That is because he (al-Ma\u2019mu\u2019n) has seen his (the Imam\u2019s) brilliant excellence, his plain knowledge, his manifest piety, his pure asceticism, his renouncing the world, and his being safe from the people. It has become clear for him that reports, tongues, and words have unanimously agreed upon his candidacy. Besides, he knew of his excellence as a youth and through adolescence, so he has appointed him as his successor after him.<ref name=\"al-Qarashi2\">{{cite book|url=http://maaref-foundation.com/english/index.htm|title=The life of Im\u0101m 'Ali Bin M\u016bs\u0101 al-Rid\u0101|last1=al-Qarashi|first1=B\u0101qir Sharif|others=Translated by J\u0101sim al-Rasheed}}</ref></blockquote>When Imam al-Ridha also declined this position, al-Ma'mun threatened him saying \"Your ancestor Ali was chosen by the second caliph to be in a six member council to elect the third caliph, and ordered to kill any one of the six who didn't comply. If you do not accept the position of Crown Prince in my government, I will follow through on the same threat\".

What kind of things are you talking about? The sons of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and [[Fatimah Zahra]] are worthy and outstanding only when they obey the command of Allah, and keep themselves away from sin and blunder. You think you are like [[Musa al-Kadhim]], [[Ali ibn Husayn]], and other [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imams]]? Whereas, they took pains and bore hardships on the way to Allah and prayed to Allah day and night. Do you think you will gain without pain? Be aware, that if a person out of us the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] performs a good deed, he gets twice the reward. Because not only he performed good deeds like others but also that he has maintained the honor of Muhammad. If he practices something bad and does a sin, he has performed two sins. One is that he performed a bad act like the rest of the people and the other one is that he has negated the honor of Muhammad. O brother! The one who obeys Allah is from us the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] and the one who is a sinner is not ours. Allah said about the son of [[Noah]] who cut the spiritual bondage with his father, \"He is not out of your lineage; if he was out of your lineage, I would have (saved) and granted him salvation.\"<ref name=\"Oyun\"/>}}\n\n==Debates==\n[[Al-Ma'mun]] was very interested in working on various sciences translated into Arabic. Thus he arranged debates between the Imam and Muslim scholars and the leaders of religion sects who came in his presence.<ref name= \"madelung\"/><ref name=\"shiite Islam\"/>\nOne of the discussions was on Divine Unity with Sulaiman al-Mervi; a scholar from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], another discussion with Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Jahm was devoted to the sinlessness of the Prophets, which led to another debate on the same subject which Ma'mun took a great part in it himself. Many of these debates are recorded in the collections of [[Shia]] [[hadith]]s, like [[Oyoun Akhbar Al-Ridha]]. The following is an example of these debates which took place between the Imam and an unbeliever([[Zind\u012bq]]).<ref name=\"chittick\"/><ref name= \"madelung\"/>\n\n(The Imam) said to him (Zind\u012bq), \"Dost thou see that if the correct view is your view then are we not equal? All that we have prayed, fasted, given of the alms and declared of our convictions will not harm us. If the correct view is our view then have not you perished and we gained salvation?\"\nthe Man said. \"Then let me know, how is He and where is He?\" Abu-l-Hasan(the Imam)answered, \"surely the opinion thou hast adopted is mistaken. He determined the 'where', and He was, when there was no 'where'; and He fashioned the 'how', and He was, when there was no 'how'. So He is not known through 'howness' or 'whereness'\" The man said, \"So then surely He is nothing if He cannot be perceived by any of the senses.\" Abu-l-Hasan said, \"when our senses fail to perceive Him, we know for certain that He is our Lord \u2026\" The man said, \"Then tell me, when was He?\" Abu-l-Hasan said, \"Tell when He was not, and then I will tell you when He was...\" The man said, \"Then why has He veiled Himself (from men)?\" Abu-l-Hasan replied, \"Surely the veil is upon creatures because of the abundance of their sins. As for Him, no secret is hidden from Him during the day or the night\u2026\"\n\nThis is a long debate, entitled, ''The Veil'', full text of which could be found in the ''A Shiite Anthology'' translated by [[William Chittick]].<ref name=\"chittick\"/> According to some accounts, Ma'mun's main objective of holding the meetings was a hope to render the Imam incapable of answering questions in order to undermine his popularity. It is related from al-Nawfali who quoted the Imam as saying\n\n<blockquote>Would you (al-Nawfali) like to know when al-Ma'm\u016bn will feel remorseful? ...When he hears me argue with the people of the Torah quoting their own Torah, with the people of the Gospel quoting their own Gospel, with the people of the Psalms quoting their own Psalms, with the Zoroastrians arguing in their Persian language, with the Romans in their own Latin... then al-Ma'm\u016bn will realize that he will not achieve what he aspires...<ref name=\"al-Qarashi\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:QoranQomMuseum.jpg|thumb|300px|A version of the [[Quran]] written by Al-Ridha, now in the [[Qom]] Museum, [[Iran]]]]\n\n==Works==\n\n===Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah===\n{{Main|Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah}}\n[[Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah]] (The Golden Treatise) is a treatise on medical cures and the maintenance of good health which is said to have been written in accordance with the demand of [[al-Ma'mun|Ma'mun]].<ref name= \"madelung\"/><ref name=\"al islam\">{{cite book |last= Muhammad Jawad Fadlallah |date= |title= Imam ar-Ridha', A Historical and Biographical Research |url=http://www.al-islam.org/imam-ar-ridha-a-historical-and-biographical-research-muhammad-jawad-fadlallah|others=Yasin T.

After finally being able to persuade al-Rida to accept this position, al-Ma'mun realized his mistake, for Shia began to gain even more popularity. Moreover, Arab party in [[Baghdad]] were furious when they heard that al-Ma'mun not only appointed the imam as his successor, but sent out commands that the [[Abbasid]]'d black flag should be changed to green in honor of the Imam. They were afraid that the empire would be taken from them. They got together, therefore, to depose Ma'mun and give allegiance to [[Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi]], who was the uncle of Ma'mun.<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/> When Ma'mun heard this, the Imam advised him to solve the problem by dismissing him from his position but he did not heed and decided to return to [[Baghdad]] and assert his rights.<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/> However, when they reached the town of [[Sarakhs]], his vizier was assassinated, and when they reached [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], al-Ma'm\u016bn poisoned the Imam. Then, Muhammad Taqi imam's son came.

According to [[Wilferd Madelung|Madelung]] the unexpected death of both the vizier and the successor, \"whose presence would have made any reconciliation with the powerful \u02bfAbbasid opposition in Baghdad virtually impossible, must indeed arouse strong suspicion that Ma'mun had had a hand in the deaths.\"<ref name= \"madelung\"/><ref name=\"al-Qarashi\"/> The more popular record about his death is that he died in 203 AH, at the age of 50.

[[Parker Brothers]] was purchased by [[Hasbro]] a few years later, and they published the game internationally under their [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]] brand. The objective of the 2-to-6-player game is to score points by uniquely naming objects within a set of categories, given an initial letter, within a time limit. The game is based on a traditional game known as '''Tutti Frutti''', '''Jeu du Baccalaur\u00e9at''', '''Stadt Land Fluss''', and many other names.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game is played in sets of 3 rounds.\n# Each player takes a folder with an answering pad and 3 category cards.  Each sheet in the answering pad has three columns of 12 blank lines. In addition, the category cards have 4 lists, each with 12 unique categories, for a total of 144 categories in the game. In new versions of the game, each card has 2 lists of 12 unique categories, for a total of 16 lists and 192 categories.  All players must agree on the list to use.\n# One player rolls a [[20-sided die|20-sided letter die]] to determine the first letter used.  The timer is set for up to three minutes.\n# One player starts the timer. In the time allotted, each player must attempt to think of and write down, in the first column on the pad, a word or term that fits each of the 12 categories and starts with the rolled letter. Any number of words in the answer is allowed, as long as the first word starts with the correct letter. For example, with a category of \"vegetable\" and a letter of \"C\", words such as \"[[cauliflower]]\", \"[[carrot]]\" and \"[[collard greens]]\" are acceptable, but \"[[broccoli]]\" is not (wrong initial letter), nor is \"[[citrus]]\" (wrong category). [[Alliteration]] is encouraged with proper nouns in one game variation; [[Ronald Reagan]] is worth 2 points, and [[Hubert Horatio Humphrey]] is worth 3.<ref>[http://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/Scattergories.pdf \"The Game of Scattergories\"], [[Hasbro]], 2003</ref>\n# Writing a bad answer is still better than no answer though because there is always the possibility that the group playing will accept the answer.  For example, \"citrus\" is \"[[Vegetable_(disambiguation) |vegetable]]\" in the sense referring to the entire plant kingdom, i.e. neither \"animal\" nor \"mineral\".\n# All players stop writing when the timer is finished. Following the list, each player, in turn, reads their answer for each category. Players score zero points for an answer that duplicates another answer in that round, and one point for an answer no other player has given. You cannot have more than one answer on a line for each number. Acceptable answers that are proper nouns using alliteration score one point for each word using the letter. (In the \"Junior\" version, players earn 2 points for an answer that begins with the chosen letter, and 1 point for an answer that does not begin with the chosen letter, but no points for a duplicate answer.)\n# If for some reason a player thinks someone's answer does not fit the category (for instance, \"knuckle\" for the category \"types of sandwich\") a player may challenge that answer. When challenged, all players vote on the validity of that answer. If the vote is a tie, the vote of the player who is being challenged is thrown out.\n# The die is rolled again (and re-rolled if the same letter as the previous round is duplicated), and the second round starts.\n# In the case of proper nouns, all parts of the answer will be counted as adequate provided one begins with the letter in play.  For example, in the case of U.S. Presidents using the letter \"S\", an acceptable answer would be Harry S. Truman, as his middle name is the letter \"S.\"  Martin Sheen, however, was never a U.S. President, and therefore is not a valid answer, rewarding zero points.  Note: This rule does not apply to book titles, such as \"The Count of Monte Cristo.\"\n# In the case of general categories, broad interpretation is allowed for fun and creative game play. For example, in the case of things commonly found in the kitchen that start with the letter K, both knife (a kitchen tool) or Kelp, (a type of food that is commonly cooked in kitchens around the world) are acceptable answers. \n[[Image:ScatDice.JPG|thumb|right|252px|The ''Scattergories'' 20-sided die includes the letters ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E'', ''F'', ''G'', ''H'', ''I'', ''J'', ''K'', ''L'', ''M'', ''N'', ''O'', ''P'', ''R'', ''S'', ''T'', and ''W'' and excludes the letters ''Q'', ''U'', ''V'', ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z''.]]\n\n==Later versions==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Scattergories2.jpg|300px]] -->\n\nIn 1989, Milton Bradley published a \"refill\" pack for Scattergories. It consists of 18 cards with 144 new categories and contains 6 new answer pads.\n\nIn 2008, [[Winning Moves|Winning Moves Games USA]] published Scattergories The Card Game. It is a fast-playing, portable game of Scattergories. (It is not a booster pack.) The game includes a deck of letter cards, a deck of category cards and 2 \"I Know\" cards. Players turn over the top card in the letter deck and category deck and the first person to shout out a correct answer takes a card. For example, if an \"S\" is turned over and \"The Beach\" is turned over...if someone slaps the \"I Know\" card and says \"I Know! Sand.\" That player claims either card and turns over a new letter or subject card (depending on what they claimed.) The game ends when one entire deck is exhausted. The player with the most cards wins.\n\nIn January 2010, [[Puzzlewright Press]]  published \"Scattergories Word Search Puzzles\" by Mark Danna, a former associate editor at Games magazine. Sanctioned by Hasbro, this book provides Scattergories players a way to play a solitaire version of the game with the following variations: write down two answers, not just one, for every category; instead of coming up with unique answers, try to match answers, which are hidden in a word search; score bonus points by matching answers hidden in the word search grid's leftover letters. There are no rounds. Players try to beat their most recent or their best score. Categories in the book are based on the ones in the board game but have modifications. There are 60 puzzle games in all.\n\nIn 2010, [[Winning Moves|Winning Moves Games USA]] published \"Scattergories Categories\" which is a twist on classic Scattergories play.  Instead of finding answers that all start with one letter, Scattergories Categories focuses on one category per round and players race to find a unique answer starting with each letter in the category key word, which is related to the category in some way.  As the game box shows, if the category word is \"CAMPING TRIP\" players have 2 minutes to find a word that starts with a C, then an A, then an M, and a P... and so on.  Players get 1 point for each unique answer and the first player to 25 points wins.  The game contains 250 word challenges on 125 cards for players 12 and up.\n\n==Game show version==\n{{main|Scattergories (game show)}}\nScattergories became an [[NBC]] game show in 1993 hosted by [[Dick Clark]].

Each quarter begins with the 31-day months of January, April, July, or October.\n\nThe World Calendar also has the following two additional days to maintain the same new year days as the [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\n; Worldsday\n: The last day of the year following Saturday 30 December. This additional day is dated \"W\" and named Worldsday, a year-end world holiday.

It is followed by Sunday, 1 July within the same year.\n\nThe World Calendar treats Worldsday and Leapyear Day as a 24-hour waiting period before resuming the calendar again. These off-calendar days, also known as \"[[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary days]]\", are not assigned weekday designations.

The 365th day of the [[Solar cycle (calendar)|solar cycle]] would be a year-end, \"intercalary\" and optionally holiday. In leap years, a second \"intercalary day\" follows Saturday, 30 June.\n\n[[Elisabeth Achelis]] founded The World Calendar Association (TWCA) in 1930 with the goal of worldwide adoption of The World Calendar. It functioned for most of the next twenty-five years as The World Calendar Association, Inc. Throughout the 1930s, support for the concept grew in the [[League of Nations]], the precursor of the United Nations. Achelis started the Journal of Calendar Reform in 1931, publishing it for twenty-five years,<ref>Journal of Calendar Reform, published and distributed quarterly 1930\u20131955 by The World Calendar Association</ref> and wrote five books<ref>THE WORLD CALENDAR \u2013 Addresses and Occasional Papers Chronologically Arranged on the Progress of Calendar Reform Since 1930 \u2013 by Elisabeth Achelis (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1937);<br/>\nTHE CALENDAR FOR EVERYBODY by Elisabeth Achelis (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1943);<br/>\nTHE CALENDAR FOR THE MODERN AGE by Elisabeth Achelis (Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1951);<br/>\nOF TIME AND THE CALENDAR by Elisabeth Achelis (Hermitage House Inc., New York and George J. McLeod, LTD., Toronto, Canada, 1955);<br/>\nAutobiography BE NOT SILENT by Elisabeth Achelis (Pageant Press, Inc., 1961)</ref> on the calendar concept.\n\nFollowing World War II, Achelis solicited worldwide support for The World Calendar. As the movement gained international appeal with legislation introduced in the United States Congress, awaiting international decisions, Achelis accepted advice that the United Nations was the proper body to act on calendar reform. At the United Nations in 1955, the United States significantly delayed universal adoption by withholding support \"unless such a reform were favoured by a substantial majority of the citizens of the United States acting through their representatives in the Congress of the United States.\" Also, Achelis wrote in 1955 (JCR Vol. 25, page 169), \"While Affiliates and Committees have over the years and still are able to approach all branches of their governments, the Incorporated (International) Association was prevented from seeking legislation in the United States lest it lose its tax exempt status. Because of this I have been prevented from doing in my own country that which I have been urging all other Affiliates to do in theirs.\"\n\nBy 1956, she dissolved The World Calendar Association, Incorporated. It continued as the International World Calendar Association through the rest of the century with several directors including Molly E. Kalkstein, who is related to Achelis, and who provided the Association's first official website during her 2000\u20132004 tenure. The Association reorganised in 2005 as The World Calendar Association, International. It is currently active with resumed efforts towards adoption of The World Calendar in 2017 or 2023. The World Calendar Association's current director is Wayne Edward Richardson of [[Ellinwood, Kansas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theworldcalendar.org/Contact.html |title=Contact The World Calendar Association |publisher=The World Calendar Association |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Benefits and problems}}Reception==\n===Benefits===\nAs with other calendar reform proposals, supporters point out several benefits to the World Calendar over the current Gregorian calendar.\n\nProponents refer to its simple structure. Each day is assigned an exact, repetitive date relative to week and month. Quarterly statistics are easier to compare, since the four quarters are the same length each year. Economic savings occur from less need to print calendars because only the year number changes. Work and school schedules do not need to unnecessarily reinvent themselves, at great expense, year after year. The World Calendar can be memorised by anyone and used similarly to a clock.\n\nBecause the World Calendar is perpetual, there is no need to churn out copies of it every year. Dates in the World Calendar occur with no more than two days difference from Gregorian calendar dates.\n\n===Religious objections===\nThe main opponents of The World Calendar in the 20th century were leaders of religions that worship according to a seven-day cycle. For Jews, Christians and Muslims, particular days of worship are ancient and fundamental elements of their faith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748231,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|title=Calendar Reform|date=17 December 1934|accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nJews observe Saturday as ''[[Shabbat]]'', on the basis of the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]]'s injunction to \"[[remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy]]\" (Exodus 20:8). Christians worship on [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sunday]], the [[Lord's Day]], on which they believe Christ rose from the dead. Muslims perform the ''[[jumu'ah]]'' prayer in Mosques on Fridays, the day they believe Adam was created. Likewise, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] are required to worship every Saturday.\n\nAdherents of these religions object that intercalary days are counted outside the usual seven-day week and disrupt the traditional weekly cycle. A week with a Worldsday would be eight days long. Adherents of these religions insist that they would have to continue observing their holidays every seventh day, causing the worship days to drift by one day each year (two on a leap year), relative to The World Calendar week. The day of rest would then no longer coincide with the weekend.\n\nThese concerns played a role in the United States government's decision, at the United Nations, in 1955, not to recommend further study.<ref>Your Washington Review by Congressman Jerry Ford, For Release 5 May 1955, [http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/fordcong/4525448.pdf From page 11 of an online collection of Box D1 of the Gerald R. Ford Congressional Papers at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library.] Jerry Ford wrote: \"... I haye received numerous letters in opposition to the proposed world caleridar change. I am in complete agreement with the opinions expressed in these letters and I will oppose any calendar change. The Department of State advises me that the United Nations may set up a study group on calendar reform. Secretary John Foster Dulles and our representatives at the U. N. are not in favor of this action and the United States will officially oppose setting up this U.N. study group on calendar reform. I have also been informed that our State Department will hold to that position until there is Congressional authorization for the calendar study. From my observations it seems that Congress is in no mood to tamper with the calendar.\"</ref>\n\nSupporters of The World Calendar do not deny that their system is at odds with the traditions of a significant portion of the world's population, but argue that Worldsdays and Leapyear Days can be treated as \"double\" holidays by those who wish to maintain the seven-day week sequence.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\n===ISO 8601===\nThe World Calendar, unlike some other proposals, is not compatible with the international standard [[ISO 8601]], which is based upon, but differs from, the Gregorian calendar. They differ regarding the first weekday of the week (Sunday vs. Monday), and ISO 8601 does not support intercalary dates (e.g. in notation). The World Calendar, however, modifies the Gregorian calendar less than other calendar reform proposals to achieve the sought after improvements of a simpler and perpetual calendar.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Calendar reform]]\n* [[List of calendars]]\n*[[Perennial Calendar]]\n*[[International Fixed Calendar]] : another calendar reform proposed before the World Calendar\n*[[World Season Calendar]], proposed by [[Isaac Asimov]] in 1973, and almost identical to the World Calendar\n*[[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar]] : another perennial calendar, but with a seven-day cycle that avoids the religious opposition to the World Calendar\n*[[Holocene calendar]] : a reform in year numbering\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.theworldcalendar.org/ The World Calendar Association Website]\n*[http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/achelis.html Biography of Elisabeth Achelis]\n*[http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/calendar-reform.html Calendar Reform]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2012}}\n{{Calendars}}\n{{Time Topics}}\n{{Time measurement and standards}}\n{{Chronology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:World Calendar, The}}\n[[Category:Proposed calendars]]\n[[Category:Specific calendars]]\n[[Category:1930 in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:1930 in science]]\n[[Category:1930 works]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the calendar in common use|Gregorian calendar}}\nThe '''World Calendar''' is a proposed [[Calendar reform|reform]] of the [[Gregorian calendar]] created by [[Elisabeth Achelis]] of [[Brooklyn]], New York in 1930.\n\n==Features==\nThe World Calendar is a 12-month, [[perennial calendar]] with equal quarters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theworldcalendar.org/TWCandDescription.pdf |title=The World Calendar Description |publisher=The World Calendar Association |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nEach quarter begins on a Sunday and ends on a Saturday.

Achelis started the Journal of Calendar Reform in 1931, publishing it for twenty-five years,<ref>Journal of Calendar Reform, published and distributed quarterly 1930\u20131955 by The World Calendar Association</ref> and wrote five books<ref>THE WORLD CALENDAR \u2013 Addresses and Occasional Papers Chronologically Arranged on the Progress of Calendar Reform Since 1930 \u2013 by Elisabeth Achelis (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1937);<br/>\nTHE CALENDAR FOR EVERYBODY by Elisabeth Achelis (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1943);<br/>\nTHE CALENDAR FOR THE MODERN AGE by Elisabeth Achelis (Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1951);<br/>\nOF TIME AND THE CALENDAR by Elisabeth Achelis (Hermitage House Inc., New York and George J. McLeod, LTD., Toronto, Canada, 1955);<br/>\nAutobiography BE NOT SILENT by Elisabeth Achelis (Pageant Press, Inc., 1961)</ref> on the calendar concept.\n\nFollowing World War II, Achelis solicited worldwide support for The World Calendar. As the movement gained international appeal with legislation introduced in the United States Congress, awaiting international decisions, Achelis accepted advice that the United Nations was the proper body to act on calendar reform. At the United Nations in 1955, the United States significantly delayed universal adoption by withholding support \"unless such a reform were favoured by a substantial majority of the citizens of the United States acting through their representatives in the Congress of the United States.\" Also, Achelis wrote in 1955 (JCR Vol. 25, page 169), \"While Affiliates and Committees have over the years and still are able to approach all branches of their governments, the Incorporated (International) Association was prevented from seeking legislation in the United States lest it lose its tax exempt status. Because of this I have been prevented from doing in my own country that which I have been urging all other Affiliates to do in theirs.\"\n\nBy 1956, she dissolved The World Calendar Association, Incorporated. It continued as the International World Calendar Association through the rest of the century with several directors including Molly E. Kalkstein, who is related to Achelis, and who provided the Association's first official website during her 2000\u20132004 tenure. The Association reorganised in 2005 as The World Calendar Association, International. It is currently active with resumed efforts towards adoption of The World Calendar in 2017 or 2023. The World Calendar Association's current director is Wayne Edward Richardson of [[Ellinwood, Kansas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theworldcalendar.org/Contact.html |title=Contact The World Calendar Association |publisher=The World Calendar Association |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Benefits and problems}}Reception==\n===Benefits===\nAs with other calendar reform proposals, supporters point out several benefits to the World Calendar over the current Gregorian calendar.\n\nProponents refer to its simple structure. Each day is assigned an exact, repetitive date relative to week and month. Quarterly statistics are easier to compare, since the four quarters are the same length each year. Economic savings occur from less need to print calendars because only the year number changes. Work and school schedules do not need to unnecessarily reinvent themselves, at great expense, year after year. The World Calendar can be memorised by anyone and used similarly to a clock.\n\nBecause the World Calendar is perpetual, there is no need to churn out copies of it every year. Dates in the World Calendar occur with no more than two days difference from Gregorian calendar dates.\n\n===Religious objections===\nThe main opponents of The World Calendar in the 20th century were leaders of religions that worship according to a seven-day cycle. For Jews, Christians and Muslims, particular days of worship are ancient and fundamental elements of their faith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748231,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|title=Calendar Reform|date=17 December 1934|accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nJews observe Saturday as ''[[Shabbat]]'', on the basis of the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]]'s injunction to \"[[remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy]]\" (Exodus 20:8). Christians worship on [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sunday]], the [[Lord's Day]], on which they believe Christ rose from the dead. Muslims perform the ''[[jumu'ah]]'' prayer in Mosques on Fridays, the day they believe Adam was created. Likewise, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] are required to worship every Saturday.\n\nAdherents of these religions object that intercalary days are counted outside the usual seven-day week and disrupt the traditional weekly cycle. A week with a Worldsday would be eight days long. Adherents of these religions insist that they would have to continue observing their holidays every seventh day, causing the worship days to drift by one day each year (two on a leap year), relative to The World Calendar week. The day of rest would then no longer coincide with the weekend.\n\nThese concerns played a role in the United States government's decision, at the United Nations, in 1955, not to recommend further study.<ref>Your Washington Review by Congressman Jerry Ford, For Release 5 May 1955, [http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/fordcong/4525448.pdf From page 11 of an online collection of Box D1 of the Gerald R. Ford Congressional Papers at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library.] Jerry Ford wrote: \"... I haye received numerous letters in opposition to the proposed world caleridar change. I am in complete agreement with the opinions expressed in these letters and I will oppose any calendar change. The Department of State advises me that the United Nations may set up a study group on calendar reform. Secretary John Foster Dulles and our representatives at the U. N. are not in favor of this action and the United States will officially oppose setting up this U.N. study group on calendar reform. I have also been informed that our State Department will hold to that position until there is Congressional authorization for the calendar study. From my observations it seems that Congress is in no mood to tamper with the calendar.\"</ref>\n\nSupporters of The World Calendar do not deny that their system is at odds with the traditions of a significant portion of the world's population, but argue that Worldsdays and Leapyear Days can be treated as \"double\" holidays by those who wish to maintain the seven-day week sequence.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\n===ISO 8601===\nThe World Calendar, unlike some other proposals, is not compatible with the international standard [[ISO 8601]], which is based upon, but differs from, the Gregorian calendar. They differ regarding the first weekday of the week (Sunday vs. Monday), and ISO 8601 does not support intercalary dates (e.g. in notation). The World Calendar, however, modifies the Gregorian calendar less than other calendar reform proposals to achieve the sought after improvements of a simpler and perpetual calendar.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Calendar reform]]\n* [[List of calendars]]\n*[[Perennial Calendar]]\n*[[International Fixed Calendar]] : another calendar reform proposed before the World Calendar\n*[[World Season Calendar]], proposed by [[Isaac Asimov]] in 1973, and almost identical to the World Calendar\n*[[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar]] : another perennial calendar, but with a seven-day cycle that avoids the religious opposition to the World Calendar\n*[[Holocene calendar]] : a reform in year numbering\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.theworldcalendar.org/ The World Calendar Association Website]\n*[http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/achelis.html Biography of Elisabeth Achelis]\n*[http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/calendar-reform.html Calendar Reform]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2012}}\n{{Calendars}}\n{{Time Topics}}\n{{Time measurement and standards}}\n{{Chronology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:World Calendar, The}}\n[[Category:Proposed calendars]]\n[[Category:Specific calendars]]\n[[Category:1930 in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:1930 in science]]\n[[Category:1930 works]]\n", "name_user": "VirguloMane", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFeatures", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Calendar"}
