Bacteria can increase in number very quickly, which enables them to [[evolution|evolve]] rapidly. Should some bacteria survive a chemical attack, they give rise to new generations composed completely of bacteria that have resistance to the particular chemical used. Under a sustained chemical attack, the surviving bacteria in successive generations are increasingly resistant to the chemical used, and ultimately the chemical is rendered ineffective. For this reason, some question the wisdom of impregnating cloths, [[cutting board]]s and worktops in the home with [[bactericidal]] chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Types==\n\n===Air disinfectants===\nAir disinfectants are typically chemical substances capable of disinfecting microorganisms suspended in the air. Disinfectants are generally assumed to be limited to use on surfaces, but that is not the case.  In 1928, a study found that airborne microorganisms could be killed using mists of dilute bleach.<ref name=\"bacterialaction\">For a review of the early work in this field, see: {{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson OH, Bigg E, Puck TT, Miller BF |title= The bactericidal action of propylene glycol vapor on microorganisms suspended in air. i |journal= Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=75 |pages=593\u2013610 |date=June 1942  |pmid=19871209 |doi=10.1084/jem.75.6.593 |issue= 6 |pmc= 2135271}}</ref> An air disinfectant must be dispersed either as an [[aerosol]] or [[vapour]]<!--WP:ENGVAR: please WP:RETAIN--> at a sufficient concentration in the air to cause the number of viable infectious microorganisms to be significantly reduced.\n\nIn the 1940s and early 1950s, further studies showed inactivation of diverse [[bacteria]], [[influenza virus]], and ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]'' (previously ''P. notatum'') [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] [[fungus]] using various glycols, principally [[propylene glycol]] and [[triethylene glycol]].<ref name=\"bactericidaleffects\">For a review through 1952 see: {{cite journal |vauthors=Lester W, Dunklin E, Robertson OH |title= Bactericidal effects of propylene and triethylene glycol vapors on airborne Escherichia coli |journal= Science |volume=115 |pages=379\u2013382 |date=April 1952 |pmid= 17770126 |doi=10.1126/Science.115.2988.379 |issue= 2988|bibcode=1952Sci...115..379L }}</ref>  In principle, these chemical substances are ideal air disinfectants because they have both high lethality to microorganisms and low mammalian toxicity.<ref name=\"propyleneglycol\">For a review of the toxicity of propylene glycol, see:  {{cite journal |author= United States Environmental Protection Agency |title= Reregistration eligibility decision for propylene glycol and dipropylene glycol |volume= EPA 739-R-06-002 |date=September 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"triethyleneglycol\">For a review of the toxicity of triethylene glycol, see:  {{cite journal |author= United States Environmental Protection Agency |title= Reregistration eligibility decision for triethylene glycol |volume= EPA 739-R-05-002 |date=September 2005}}</ref>\n\nAlthough glycols are effective air disinfectants in controlled laboratory environments, it is more difficult to use them effectively in real-world environments because the disinfection of air is sensitive to continuous action.  Continuous action in real-world environments with outside air exchanges at door, HVAC, and window interfaces, and in the presence of materials that adsorb and remove glycols from the air, poses engineering challenges that are not critical for surface disinfection.

A large number of disinfectants operate in this way. [[Chlorine]] and [[oxygen]] are strong oxidizers, so their compounds figure heavily here.\n\n*[[Electrolyzed water]] or \"Anolyte\" is an oxidizing, acidic hypochlorite solution made by [[electrolysis]] of [[sodium chloride]] into [[sodium hypochlorite]] and hypochlorous acid. Anolyte has an oxidation-reduction potential of +600 to +1200 mV and a typical pH range of 3.5\u2013\u20138.5, but the most potent solution is produced at a controlled pH 5.0\u20136.3 where the predominant oxychlorine species is [[hypochlorous acid]].\n*[[Hydrogen peroxide]] is used in [[hospital]]s to disinfect surfaces and it is used in solution alone or in combination with other chemicals as a high level disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide is sometimes mixed with [[colloidal silver]]. It is often preferred because it causes far fewer [[allergic]] reactions than alternative disinfectants. Also used in the food packaging industry to disinfect foil containers. A 3% solution is also used as an antiseptic.\n* [[Vaporized hydrogen peroxide|Hydrogen peroxide vapor]] is used as a [[Sterilization (microbiology)|medical sterilant]] and as room disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide has the advantage that it decomposes to form oxygen and water thus leaving no long term residues, but hydrogen peroxide as with most other strong oxidants is hazardous, and solutions are a primary irritant. The vapor is hazardous to the respiratory system and eyes and consequently the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] permissible exposure limit is 1 ppm (29 CFR 1910.1000 Table Z-1) calculated as an eight-hour time weighted average and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] immediately dangerous to life and health limit is 75 ppm.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |title=CDC - Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH): Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values - NIOSH Publications and Products |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117012820/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |archivedate=17 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Therefore, engineering controls, personal protective equipment, gas monitoring etc. should be employed where high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are used in the workplace. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide is one of the chemicals approved for decontamination of anthrax spores from contaminated buildings, such as occurred during the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in the U.S. It has also been shown to be effective in removing exotic animal viruses, such as avian influenza and [[Newcastle disease]] from equipment and surfaces.\n* The antimicrobial action of hydrogen peroxide can be enhanced by [[surfactant]]s and organic acids. The resulting chemistry is known as Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide. A 2% solution, stabilized for extended use, achieves high-level disinfection in 5 minutes, and is suitable for disinfecting medical equipment made from hard plastic, such as in [[endoscope]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Omidbakhsh|title= A new peroxide-based flexible endoscope-compatible high-level disinfectant |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |volume=34 |issue=9 |pages=571\u2013577 |year=2006 | pmid=17097451 |doi= 10.1016/j.ajic.2006.02.003|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  The evidence available suggests that products based on Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide, apart from being good germicides, are safer for humans and benign to the environment.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Sattar|title= A product based on accelerated hydrogen peroxide: Evidence for broad-spectrum activity |journal=Canadian Journal of Infection Control |pages=123\u2013130 |date=Winter 1998 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n*[[Ozone]] is a gas used for disinfecting water, laundry, foods, air, and surfaces. It is chemically aggressive and destroys many organic compounds, resulting in rapid decolorization and deodorization in addition to disinfection. Ozone decomposes relatively quickly. However, due to this characteristic of ozone, tap water chlorination cannot be entirely replaced by ozonation, as the ozone would decompose already in the water piping. Instead, it is used to remove the bulk of oxidizable matter from the water, which would produce small amounts of [[organochloride]]s if treated with chlorine only. Regardless, ozone has a very wide range of applications from municipal to industrial water treatment due to its powerful reactivity. \n*[[Potassium permanganate]] (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) is a purplish-black crystalline powder that colours everything it touches, through a strong oxidising action. This includes staining \"stainless\" steel, which somehow limits its use and makes it necessary to use plastic or glass containers.  It is used to disinfect [[aquarium]]s and is  used in some community swimming pools as a foot disinfectant before entering the pool. Typically, a large shallow basin of KMnO<sub>4</sub> / water solution is kept near the pool ladder. Participants are required to step in the basin and then go into the pool. Additionally, it is widely used to disinfect community water ponds and wells in tropical countries, as well as to disinfect the mouth before pulling out teeth.

A large number of disinfectants operate in this way. [[Chlorine]] and [[oxygen]] are strong oxidizers, so their compounds figure heavily here.\n\n*[[Electrolyzed water]] or \"Anolyte\" is an oxidizing, acidic hypochlorite solution made by [[electrolysis]] of [[sodium chloride]] into [[sodium hypochlorite]] and hypochlorous acid. Anolyte has an oxidation-reduction potential of +600 to +1200 mV and a typical pH range of 3.5\u2013\u20138.5, but the most potent solution is produced at a controlled pH 5.0\u20136.3 where the predominant oxychlorine species is [[hypochlorous acid]].\n*[[Hydrogen peroxide]] is used in [[hospital]]s to disinfect surfaces and it is used in solution alone or in combination with other chemicals as a high level disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide is sometimes mixed with [[colloidal silver]]. It is often preferred because it causes far fewer [[allergic]] reactions than alternative disinfectants. Also used in the food packaging industry to disinfect foil containers. A 3% solution is also used as an antiseptic.\n* [[Vaporized hydrogen peroxide|Hydrogen peroxide vapor]] is used as a [[Sterilization (microbiology)|medical sterilant]] and as room disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide has the advantage that it decomposes to form oxygen and water thus leaving no long term residues, but hydrogen peroxide as with most other strong oxidants is hazardous, and solutions are a primary irritant. The vapor is hazardous to the respiratory system and eyes and consequently the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] permissible exposure limit is 1 ppm (29 CFR 1910.1000 Table Z-1) calculated as an eight-hour time weighted average and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] immediately dangerous to life and health limit is 75 ppm.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |title=CDC - Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH): Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values - NIOSH Publications and Products |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117012820/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |archivedate=17 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Therefore, engineering controls, personal protective equipment, gas monitoring etc. should be employed where high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are used in the workplace.

It is chemically aggressive and destroys many organic compounds, resulting in rapid decolorization and deodorization in addition to disinfection. Ozone decomposes relatively quickly. However, due to this characteristic of ozone, tap water chlorination cannot be entirely replaced by ozonation, as the ozone would decompose already in the water piping. Instead, it is used to remove the bulk of oxidizable matter from the water, which would produce small amounts of [[organochloride]]s if treated with chlorine only. Regardless, ozone has a very wide range of applications from municipal to industrial water treatment due to its powerful reactivity. \n*[[Potassium permanganate]] (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) is a purplish-black crystalline powder that colours everything it touches, through a strong oxidising action. This includes staining \"stainless\" steel, which somehow limits its use and makes it necessary to use plastic or glass containers.  It is used to disinfect [[aquarium]]s and is  used in some community swimming pools as a foot disinfectant before entering the pool. Typically, a large shallow basin of KMnO<sub>4</sub> / water solution is kept near the pool ladder. Participants are required to step in the basin and then go into the pool. Additionally, it is widely used to disinfect community water ponds and wells in tropical countries, as well as to disinfect the mouth before pulling out teeth. It can be applied to wounds in dilute solution.\n\n=== Peroxy and peroxo acids ===\n[[Peroxy acid|Peroxycarboxylic acids and inorganic peroxo acids]] are strong oxidants and extremely effective disinfectants.\n\n* [[Peroxyformic acid]]\n* [[Peracetic acid]]\n* [[Peroxypropionic acid]]\n* [[Monoperoxyglutaric acid]]\n* [[Monoperoxysuccinic acid]]\n* [[Peroxybenzoic acid]]\n* [[Peroxyanisic acid]]\n* [[meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid|Chloroperbenzoic acid]]\n* [[Monoperoxyphthalic acid]]\n* [[Peroxymonosulfuric acid]]\n\n===Phenolics===\n[[Phenols|Phenolics]] are active ingredients in some household disinfectants.

The use of chlorine bleach and alcohol disinfectants does not cause [[antimicrobial resistance]] as it denatures the protein of the microbe upon contact.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://watoxics.org/healthy-living/healthy-homes-gardens-1/factsheets/antimicrobials |title=Antimicrobial Products: Who Needs Them? \u2014 Washington Toxics Coalition |publisher=Watoxics.org |date=15 September 1997 |accessdate=10 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710230146/http://watoxics.org/healthy-living/healthy-homes-gardens-1/factsheets/antimicrobials |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Drug resistance]]\n* [[Diethylene glycol]] - a raw material for air [[sanitation]]\n* [[Hand sanitizer]]\n* [[Hygiene]]\n* [[List of cleaning products]]\n* [[Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal | title = Virus resistance in a hospital environment: overview of the virucide activity of disinfectants used in liquid form | journal = Annales de Biologie Clinique | date = Nov\u2013Dec 1998 | first = H. | last = Soule |author2=D.

The series served as a continuation of ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (1967\u20131978) and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on four consecutive Saturday nights from August 18, 1979 to September 8, 1979.\n\n==Production background==\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' had completed its eleven-season run on [[CBS]], [[Carol Burnett]] and her then husband-manager [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]] were dining in a restaurant with friends (including [[Tim Conway]] from ''The Carol Burnett Show''). At that gathering, Burnett started reminiscing about the old show and making suggestions to Conway of future [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] that she wished they could create if the show was still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series; Conway immediately agreed.\n\nTaking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton then approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979, but CBS already had their schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was interested and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' \u2013 under the title ''Carol Burnett & Company'' \u2013 were produced and most of Burnett's former staff and crew were on board for the new series.\n\n==Overview==\nThe series was produced by [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]] and continued the same format of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' by featuring comedy sketches and musical numbers, including favorite characters/sketches such as \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\", \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", \"[[The Oldest Man (character)|The Oldest Man]]\", \"The Charwoman\" and Carol Burnett's impersonation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].\n\nHer ''Carol Burnett Show'' co-stars Tim Conway and [[Vicki Lawrence]] were back as regulars; due to the unavailability of [[Harvey Korman]], comic actors [[Kenneth Mars]] and [[Craig Richard Nelson]] were added to the supporting cast; Ernie Flatt, who had been the choreographer on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' during its entire run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars during the four-week period were chronologically [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]] and [[Sally Field]].  The show also introduced new sketches and characters, including another one of Conway's creations: a preacher named \"Rolly D. Tucker\" who gave humorously misguided sermons about life, with shouts of \"It don't matter!\" interspersed throughout his dissertation (Conway would later use this character on [[The Tim Conway Show (1980 TV series)|his own variety show]] when it premiered in March 1980).\n\n==Episode list==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!

Though less commercially successful than the preceding ''[[Odelay]]'', it won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Alternative Music Album]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/grammy/altperf.htm |title=Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Music Performance |publisher=Rock On The Net |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}</ref>\n\n==Background and recording==\n''Mutations'' was produced by [[Nigel Godrich]], who was well-known at that point for his previous work with [[Radiohead]]. The album contains a number of [[Moog synthesizer|Moog keyboard]]s, acoustic guitars, and string arrangements.<ref name=\"allmusiccredits\">[[AllMusic]] credits entry for ''[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r380288/credits|pure_url=yes}} Mutations]''</ref> The production style was very different from that of his previous album ''[[Odelay]]'', which was heavily influenced by [[hip hop music]] and contained many [[sampling (music)|samples]]. The lyrical content of ''Mutations'' is also much more somber and serious than that on ''Odelay'', apparent in the songs \"Nobody's Fault but My Own\" and \"Dead Melodies\".\n\nThe title ''Mutations'' may be a nod to an influential Brazilian band of the late 60s, [[Os Mutantes]]. The song \"Tropicalia\" pastiches the works of Brazilian tropicalia artists of the era.\n\n==Artwork and packaging==\nThe record's front cover, a picture of Beck tangled in [[plastic wrap]], was taken by music photographer [[Autumn de Wilde]]. Art direction was by [[abstract art]]ist [[Robert M. Fisher]]. The interior artwork features sculptures and drawings by artist [[Tim Hawkinson]].\n\n==Release==\nBefore beginning the recording sessions, Beck gained permission from the major label he was under contract with, [[Geffen Records|Geffen]], to release ''Mutations'' on the small [[indie rock|indie]] label [[Bong Load Records]]. However, when Geffen executives heard the album, they reneged on their agreement and released the record. This led to a lawsuit filed by Beck against Geffen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/517992/beck-settles-lawsuits-before-new-album-release|title=Beck Settles Lawsuits Before New Album Release|work=MTV |first=Gil |last=Kaufmann |date=October 5, 1999}}</ref>\n\nSingles were released for the songs \"[[Tropicalia (song)|Tropicalia]]\", \"Cold Brains\" (Australia and New Zealand only), and \"Nobody's Fault but My Own\" (Japan only).

The album contains a number of [[Moog synthesizer|Moog keyboard]]s, acoustic guitars, and string arrangements.<ref name=\"allmusiccredits\">[[AllMusic]] credits entry for ''[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r380288/credits|pure_url=yes}} Mutations]''</ref> The production style was very different from that of his previous album ''[[Odelay]]'', which was heavily influenced by [[hip hop music]] and contained many [[sampling (music)|samples]]. The lyrical content of ''Mutations'' is also much more somber and serious than that on ''Odelay'', apparent in the songs \"Nobody's Fault but My Own\" and \"Dead Melodies\".\n\nThe title ''Mutations'' may be a nod to an influential Brazilian band of the late 60s, [[Os Mutantes]]. The song \"Tropicalia\" pastiches the works of Brazilian tropicalia artists of the era.\n\n==Artwork and packaging==\nThe record's front cover, a picture of Beck tangled in [[plastic wrap]], was taken by music photographer [[Autumn de Wilde]]. Art direction was by [[abstract art]]ist [[Robert M. Fisher]]. The interior artwork features sculptures and drawings by artist [[Tim Hawkinson]].\n\n==Release==\nBefore beginning the recording sessions, Beck gained permission from the major label he was under contract with, [[Geffen Records|Geffen]], to release ''Mutations'' on the small [[indie rock|indie]] label [[Bong Load Records]]. However, when Geffen executives heard the album, they reneged on their agreement and released the record. This led to a lawsuit filed by Beck against Geffen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/517992/beck-settles-lawsuits-before-new-album-release|title=Beck Settles Lawsuits Before New Album Release|work=MTV |first=Gil |last=Kaufmann |date=October 5, 1999}}</ref>\n\nSingles were released for the songs \"[[Tropicalia (song)|Tropicalia]]\", \"Cold Brains\" (Australia and New Zealand only), and \"Nobody's Fault but My Own\" (Japan only).

FIU is a [[public university]] located in western Miami (playing at [[FIU Stadium]]), while the University of Miami is a [[private university]] in the suburb of [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]] (which at the time played its home games at the [[Miami Orange Bowl]]). The 2006 game was intended to be the first in the \"City Line Series,\" an annual series between the two Miami-area schools. Miami was heavily favored over FIU,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.covers.com/pageLoader/pageLoader.aspx?page=/data/ncf/teams/pastresults/2006-2007/team70.html|title=Covers.com Miami Hurricanes 2006\u20132007|accessdate=2010-12-29}} Miami was favored by 27.</ref> which was in its fifth season of football and in its second year in the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]].\n\n==The brawl==\nThroughout the game, players from both teams engaged in [[trash-talk]] and were increasingly physical.  By the third quarter, officials had called seven penalties (six for FIU and one for Miami).<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=262872390&quarter=0 Miami-FIU Play-by-Play on ESPN]</ref>\n\nWith 9 minutes left in the 3rd quarter, Miami [[H-back]] [[James Bryant (American football)|James Bryant]] caught a 5-yard [[touchdown]] pass from [[quarterback]] [[Kyle Wright]], making the score 13-0 Miami. After scoring, Bryant pointed towards Miami's West end zone.

FIU's [[Lionell Singleton]] punched Campbell in the back of the helmet, which was quickly followed by retaliation from both teams, escalating the fight to a bench-clearing brawl. Miami's [[Anthony Reddick]] swung his helmet at FIU players and Miami's [[Brandon Meriweather]] kicked an FIU player. FIU's [[A'Mod Ned]], who was previously injured, came onto the field and swung at Miami players with his crutches.  The fight lasted less than two minutes with [[Florida Highway Patrol]] State Troopers and FIU Police coming onto the field to restore order.\n\nOfficials needed several minutes to sort out the penalties.  Ultimately, 13 players were assessed 15-yard penalties for fighting and ejected from the game (eight from FIU and five from Miami).<ref name=\"13 players ejected\">{{cite web|author=Costa, Brian|url=http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/sports/colleges/fiu/15762949.htm|title=Thirteen players ejected after fight during UM-FIU game|work=Miami Herald|date=October 15, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105000819/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/sports/colleges/fiu/15762949.htm|archivedate=November 5, 2006|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}</ref> Although the unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for fighting offset each other, Miami was forced to kick off from its own 10-yard line due to the original penalty against Bryant (penalized at half the distance to the goal).\n\nAfter the brawl while waiting for the game to resume the Miami team was seen huddled in a circle in the sidelines hopping up and down in what appeared to be a celebratory gesture.  There were also several fights in the stands between UM and FIU fans which were stopped by local police.\n\nFormer Miami [[wide receiver]] [[Lamar Thomas]], who was providing [[color commentary]] for the game on [[Comcast/Charter Sports Southeast|Comcast Sports Southeast]] (CSS), made several observations during the fight, enthusiastically proclaiming that the Golden Panthers were being humbled by his former team, in a manner which was not neutral:\n<blockquote>\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.

FIU head coach [[Don Strock]] said he was \"embarrassed\" for what happened, and said that he would impose sanctions even more severe than any imposed by the [[Sun Belt Conference]], the conference in which FIU played at the time.

Miami, which already had a history of such incidents, enacted a \"zero tolerance\" policy for future incidents: any Hurricane involved in a fight will be suspended for the remainder of the season, and could face permanent banishment from the team. The same day, FIU kicked Chris Smith and McDuffie off the team (though they were allowed to keep their [[athletic scholarship|scholarships]]), and the remaining players were suspended from the team indefinitely.

FIU is a [[public university]] located in western Miami (playing at [[FIU Stadium]]), while the University of Miami is a [[private university]] in the suburb of [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]] (which at the time played its home games at the [[Miami Orange Bowl]]).

Miami's [[Anthony Reddick]] swung his helmet at FIU players and Miami's [[Brandon Meriweather]] kicked an FIU player. FIU's [[A'Mod Ned]], who was previously injured, came onto the field and swung at Miami players with his crutches.  The fight lasted less than two minutes with [[Florida Highway Patrol]] State Troopers and FIU Police coming onto the field to restore order.\n\nOfficials needed several minutes to sort out the penalties.

There were also several fights in the stands between UM and FIU fans which were stopped by local police.\n\nFormer Miami [[wide receiver]] [[Lamar Thomas]], who was providing [[color commentary]] for the game on [[Comcast/Charter Sports Southeast|Comcast Sports Southeast]] (CSS), made several observations during the fight, enthusiastically proclaiming that the Golden Panthers were being humbled by his former team, in a manner which was not neutral:\n<blockquote>\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.
