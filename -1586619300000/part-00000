The prosecutor Daniel Suneson stated he had evidence against Mayers in the form of witness statements, and videos available on the Internet and on CCTV. Suneson said he had procured SMSes of his crew: one from his bodyguard about different versions of events, and another from an assistant showing they had uploaded edited videos on Instagram and asking Mayers to destroy everything on his cellphone. The DNA on the bottle allegedly used in the assault was also analyzed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/OpmlK1/asap-rocky-to-face-trial-in-assault-case |title=ASAP Rocky to face trial in assault case |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=July 25, 2019|accessdate=July 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJafari told the police that he first approached Mayers' entourage to ask if they had seen his missing friend, not knowing who they were, but was told by the guard to go away, and then pushed.

Andrew Howell, [[Kieron St Aimie]] and Aaron Goode all signed one-year professional contracts after impressing in the youth team under Joe Gallen, who was later sacked, despite his under 18s winning the league. Gregory also signed more backroom staff, including Paul Hunter as the new physio, [[Mick Harford]] as assistant manager, [[Ed de Goey]] and [[Warren Neill]] as coaches and [[Steve Brown (footballer, born 1966)|Steve Brown]] and [[Keith Ryan]] as youth team coaches. Creative left winger [[Lee Cook]] was sold to rivals [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] for a deal reported as potentially worth between \u00a32.5 million and \u00a34.5 million. [[Michael Mancienne]] also extended his loan for a further season. On 26 July, QPR completed the loan signing of [[Ben Sahar]] for three months (subsequently extended until January 2008). The signings of [[Lee Camp (footballer)|Lee Camp]] and [[Simon Walton]] followed the day after on 27 July, totalling \u00a3500,000.\n\nDuring pre-season, new signing [[Simon Walton]] fractured his leg in a non-competitive 2-1 victory against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and was side-lined for several months.\n\n===Tragic start===\nThe season began turbulently, with a draw against recently promoted [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], a loss in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] 2-1 at home to [[Football League One|League One]] [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] followed by a further 2-0 defeat at home by [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].

This came after a comprehensive 5-1 defeat in front of the [[Sky Sports]] cameras against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 30 September.

After a goalless draw at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston]] and a rare victory away to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton]], Harford left the club later in the month and was replaced by [[Luigi De Canio]].

On 11 December 2007 QPR were drawn away from home at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the third round of the [[FA Cup]], a tie due to be played on 5 January 2008. The fixture would be the first competitive [[West London derby]] between the two sides since 1996.\n\nThe Christmas and New Year period was largely successful for the club with Rangers bouncing back from a defeat at [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth]] on [[Boxing Day]] and picking up wins away from home at second-placed [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] (4-2) and at [[Loftus Road]] against fellow strugglers [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]] (3-1).\n\n===Investment===\n{{main|Queens Park Rangers F.C.#Ownership and finances}}\nShortly prior to the traditional Christmas fixture period on 20 December 2007 it was announced that the family of [[Lakshmi Mittal]] had [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.#Ownership and finances|purchased a 20 per cent shareholding]] in the club.

Early in January QPR also managed to secure striker [[Rowan Vine]] in a permanent move following his brief loan spell which had ended in December.\n\n===January onwards===\nAround 6,000 Rangers fans made the short trip to [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] on the first weekend in January to see QPR put up a determined effort against their [[Premier League]] neighbours [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[2007\u201308 FA Cup#Third Round Proper|FA Cup third round]]. Ultimately the R's lost 1\u20130 to an unfortunate deflected own goal from [[Lee Camp (footballer)|Lee Camp]]. The Cup defeat was followed by defeat away to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. The month ended for Rangers with a 2-0 home win over [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] followed by a defeat at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff]]. As the January transfer window closed, QPR secured American goalkeeper [[Matt Pickens]] and Northern Irish defender [[Damien Delaney]] and parted ways with a number of players including [[Marcus Bignot]], [[Danny Cullip]], [[Nick Ward (Australian footballer)|Nick Ward]], [[Dominic Shimmin]], [[Sampsa Timoska]], [[Shabazz Baidoo]], [[Kieron St Aimie]], [[Stefan Moore]] and [[Pat Kanyuka]]. [[Adam Bolder]], [[Daniel Nardiello]] and [[Simon Walton]] were also put out on loan.\n\n====February====\nThe club started February well defeating third-placed [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] 3-0 at Loftus Road followed by a 3-2 away win at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].

Andrew Howell, [[Kieron St Aimie]] and Aaron Goode all signed one-year professional contracts after impressing in the youth team under Joe Gallen, who was later sacked, despite his under 18s winning the league. Gregory also signed more backroom staff, including Paul Hunter as the new physio, [[Mick Harford]] as assistant manager, [[Ed de Goey]] and [[Warren Neill]] as coaches and [[Steve Brown (footballer, born 1966)|Steve Brown]] and [[Keith Ryan]] as youth team coaches. Creative left winger [[Lee Cook]] was sold to rivals [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] for a deal reported as potentially worth between \u00a32.5 million and \u00a34.5 million. [[Michael Mancienne]] also extended his loan for a further season. On 26 July, QPR completed the loan signing of [[Ben Sahar]] for three months (subsequently extended until January 2008). The signings of [[Lee Camp (footballer)|Lee Camp]] and [[Simon Walton]] followed the day after on 27 July, totalling \u00a3500,000.\n\nDuring pre-season, new signing [[Simon Walton]] fractured his leg in a non-competitive 2-1 victory against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and was side-lined for several months.\n\n===Tragic start===\nThe season began turbulently, with a draw against recently promoted [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], a loss in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] 2-1 at home to [[Football League One|League One]] [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] followed by a further 2-0 defeat at home by [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].

This came after a comprehensive 5-1 defeat in front of the [[Sky Sports]] cameras against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 30 September.

After a goalless draw at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston]] and a rare victory away to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton]], Harford left the club later in the month and was replaced by [[Luigi De Canio]].

On 11 December 2007 QPR were drawn away from home at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the third round of the [[FA Cup]], a tie due to be played on 5 January 2008. The fixture would be the first competitive [[West London derby]] between the two sides since 1996.\n\nThe Christmas and New Year period was largely successful for the club with Rangers bouncing back from a defeat at [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth]] on [[Boxing Day]] and picking up wins away from home at second-placed [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] (4-2) and at [[Loftus Road]] against fellow strugglers [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]] (3-1).\n\n===Investment===\n{{main|Queens Park Rangers F.C.#Ownership and finances}}\nShortly prior to the traditional Christmas fixture period on 20 December 2007 it was announced that the family of [[Lakshmi Mittal]] had [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.#Ownership and finances|purchased a 20 per cent shareholding]] in the club.

Early in January QPR also managed to secure striker [[Rowan Vine]] in a permanent move following his brief loan spell which had ended in December.\n\n===January onwards===\nAround 6,000 Rangers fans made the short trip to [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] on the first weekend in January to see QPR put up a determined effort against their [[Premier League]] neighbours [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[2007\u201308 FA Cup#Third Round Proper|FA Cup third round]]. Ultimately the R's lost 1\u20130 to an unfortunate deflected own goal from [[Lee Camp (footballer)|Lee Camp]]. The Cup defeat was followed by defeat away to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. The month ended for Rangers with a 2-0 home win over [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] followed by a defeat at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff]]. As the January transfer window closed, QPR secured American goalkeeper [[Matt Pickens]] and Northern Irish defender [[Damien Delaney]] and parted ways with a number of players including [[Marcus Bignot]], [[Danny Cullip]], [[Nick Ward (Australian footballer)|Nick Ward]], [[Dominic Shimmin]], [[Sampsa Timoska]], [[Shabazz Baidoo]], [[Kieron St Aimie]], [[Stefan Moore]] and [[Pat Kanyuka]].

Showing some signs of a recovery from the start to the season, the Southampton victory left QPR 6 points off [[Football League Championship playoffs|the playoffs]] and 8 points above the relegation zone.

The efficacy of the atonement remains limited to those who believe.\n\nThis doctrine is named after its formulator [[Moses Amyraut]], and is still viewed as a variety of Calvinism in that it maintains the particularity of sovereign grace in the application of the atonement. However, detractors such as [[B. B. Warfield]] have termed it \"an inconsistent and therefore unstable form of Calvinism.\"<ref>{{Citation | author-link = B. B.

His object was not to set aside but to moderate Calvinism by ingrafting this doctrine upon the particularism of election, and thereby to fortify it against the objections of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]s, by whom the [[France|French]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]]s, or Huguenots, were surrounded and threatened. Being employed by the [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] [[Synod]] in important diplomatic negotiations with the government, he came in frequent contact with [[bishop]]s, and with [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who esteemed him highly.  His system is an approach, not so much to [[Arminianism]], which he decidedly rejected, as to [[Lutheranism]], which likewise teaches a universal atonement and a limited election.\n\nAmyraut maintained the Calvinistic premises of an eternal [[Predestination|foreordination]] and foreknowledge of God, whereby he caused all things to pass, the good efficiently, the bad permissively.  He also admitted the double decree of [[unconditional election|election]] and [[reprobation]], but his view on double predestination is modified slightly by his view of double election. He also taught that God foreordained a universal salvation through the universal sacrifice of Christ offered to all alike, on condition of faith, so that on the part of God's will and desire, the grace is universal, but as regards the condition it is particular, or only for those who do not reject it which would thereby make it ineffective.\n\nThe universal redemption scheme precedes the particular election scheme, and not vice versa. He reasons from the benevolence of God towards his creatures; the traditional Reformed presentation of predestination, he thought, improperly reasons from the result and makes facts interpret the decrees. Amyraut distinguished between objective grace which is offered to all, and subjective grace in the heart which is given only to the elect.  He also makes a distinction between natural ability and moral ability, or the power to believe and the willingness to believe; man possesses the former but not the latter in consequence of inherent depravity. It, therefore, takes an act of God to illuminate the mind, thereby engaging the will towards action. He was disposed, like [[Huldrych Zwingli]], to extend the grace of God beyond the limits of the visible Church, inasmuch as God by his general providence operates upon the heathen, as in the case of {{Bibleref2|Malachi|1:11,14}}, and may produce in them a sort of unconscious Christianity, a faith without knowledge; while within the Church he operates more fully and clearly through the means of grace.\n\nThose who never heard of Christ are condemned if they reject the general grace of providence, but the same persons would also reject Christ if he were offered to them. As regards the result, Amyraut agreed with the particularists. His ideology is unavailable, except for those in whom God previously works the condition of faith: for those who are included in the particular decree of election.\n\nAmyraut's doctrine created a great commotion in the Reformed Churches of [[France]], the [[Dutch Republic]], and [[Switzerland]]. [[Jean Daill\u00e9]] (1594\u20131670), [[David Blondel]] (1591\u20131655), and others considered it innocent and consistent with the decrees of the [[Synod of Dort]], where [[Germany|German]] Reformed and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] delegates professed similar views against the supralapsarianism of [[Franciscus Gomarus|Gomarus]].

The efficacy of the atonement remains limited to those who believe.\n\nThis doctrine is named after its formulator [[Moses Amyraut]], and is still viewed as a variety of Calvinism in that it maintains the particularity of sovereign grace in the application of the atonement.

Several theologians who signed the [[Canons of Dort]] were hypothetical universalists.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Richard A. |title=Review of ''English Hypothetical Universalism: John Preston and the Softening of Reformed Theology'' by Jonathan Moore |journal=Calvin Theological Journal |volume=43 |year=2008 |pages=149\u2013150}} quoted in {{cite web |title=Richard Muller on Non-Amyraldian Precedents to Hypothetical Universalism |work=Calvin and Calvinism |last=Ponter  |first=David W. |date=19 May 2008 |url=http://calvinandcalvinism.com/?p=284}}</ref>\n\n[[Moses Amyraut]], originally a lawyer, but converted to the study of [[theology]] by the reading of Calvin's 'Institutes', an able divine and voluminous writer, developed the doctrine of hypothetical or conditional universalism, for which his teacher, [[John Cameron (theologian)|John Cameron]] (1580\u20131625), a [[Scotland|Scot]], and for two years Headmaster of [[Academy of Saumur|Saumur Academy]], had prepared the way.  His object was not to set aside but to moderate Calvinism by ingrafting this doctrine upon the particularism of election, and thereby to fortify it against the objections of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]s, by whom the [[France|French]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]]s, or Huguenots, were surrounded and threatened. Being employed by the [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] [[Synod]] in important diplomatic negotiations with the government, he came in frequent contact with [[bishop]]s, and with [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who esteemed him highly.  His system is an approach, not so much to [[Arminianism]], which he decidedly rejected, as to [[Lutheranism]], which likewise teaches a universal atonement and a limited election.\n\nAmyraut maintained the Calvinistic premises of an eternal [[Predestination|foreordination]] and foreknowledge of God, whereby he caused all things to pass, the good efficiently, the bad permissively.  He also admitted the double decree of [[unconditional election|election]] and [[reprobation]], but his view on double predestination is modified slightly by his view of double election. He also taught that God foreordained a universal salvation through the universal sacrifice of Christ offered to all alike, on condition of faith, so that on the part of God's will and desire, the grace is universal, but as regards the condition it is particular, or only for those who do not reject it which would thereby make it ineffective.\n\nThe universal redemption scheme precedes the particular election scheme, and not vice versa. He reasons from the benevolence of God towards his creatures; the traditional Reformed presentation of predestination, he thought, improperly reasons from the result and makes facts interpret the decrees. Amyraut distinguished between objective grace which is offered to all, and subjective grace in the heart which is given only to the elect.  He also makes a distinction between natural ability and moral ability, or the power to believe and the willingness to believe; man possesses the former but not the latter in consequence of inherent depravity. It, therefore, takes an act of God to illuminate the mind, thereby engaging the will towards action. He was disposed, like [[Huldrych Zwingli]], to extend the grace of God beyond the limits of the visible Church, inasmuch as God by his general providence operates upon the heathen, as in the case of {{Bibleref2|Malachi|1:11,14}}, and may produce in them a sort of unconscious Christianity, a faith without knowledge; while within the Church he operates more fully and clearly through the means of grace.\n\nThose who never heard of Christ are condemned if they reject the general grace of providence, but the same persons would also reject Christ if he were offered to them. As regards the result, Amyraut agreed with the particularists. His ideology is unavailable, except for those in whom God previously works the condition of faith: for those who are included in the particular decree of election.\n\nAmyraut's doctrine created a great commotion in the Reformed Churches of [[France]], the [[Dutch Republic]], and [[Switzerland]]. [[Jean Daill\u00e9]] (1594\u20131670), [[David Blondel]] (1591\u20131655), and others considered it innocent and consistent with the decrees of the [[Synod of Dort]], where [[Germany|German]] Reformed and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] delegates professed similar views against the supralapsarianism of [[Franciscus Gomarus|Gomarus]]. But [[Pierre Du Moulin]] (Molin\u00e6us) (since 1621 professor of the rival theological school of Sedan), [[Friedrich Spanheim]] (1600\u201349, Professor in [[Leiden]]), [[Andr\u00e9 Rivet]] (1572\u20131651, Professor in Leiden), and the theologians of [[Geneva]] opposed it.\n\nSimilar charges were leveled against the Puritan great, Richard Baxter, who dealt frequently with Cyrus and [[Peter du Moulin]].

After the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] the Navy found itself without vessels capable of inshore work and riverine operations. In 1795 the Admiralty started to order purpose-built [[schooner]] or [[brigantine]]-rigged gun vessels.\n\n''New Betsy'' was commissioned under the command of Mr. T. Whaley in September 1796. In June 1798 Mr. John Matthew Miller took command.<ref name=Winfield/>\n\nOn 10 July Miller and Mr. Edward Dawson, master of {{HMS|Grace|1794|2}}, dined together on ''New Betsey'', together with their families and other non-commissioned officers, while both barges were at Sheerness. The meal included the imbibing of much wine, and a disagreement developed between Miller and Dawson. Dawson left ''New Betsey'' and landed on the beach.

After the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] the Navy found itself without vessels capable of inshore work and riverine operations. In 1795 the Admiralty started to order purpose-built [[schooner]] or [[brigantine]]-rigged gun vessels.\n\n''New Betsy'' was commissioned under the command of Mr. T. Whaley in September 1796. In June 1798 Mr. John Matthew Miller took command.<ref name=Winfield/>\n\nOn 10 July Miller and Mr. Edward Dawson, master of {{HMS|Grace|1794|2}}, dined together on ''New Betsey'', together with their families and other non-commissioned officers, while both barges were at Sheerness. The meal included the imbibing of much wine, and a disagreement developed between Miller and Dawson. Dawson left ''New Betsey'' and landed on the beach. When Miller stepped out of a boat to help the ladies disembark, Dawson came up and using his [[Classification of swords#Hanger|hanger]], stabbed Miller, killing him. Dawson's trial took place 25 July at Maidstone, where the jury quickly found him guilty of murder.
