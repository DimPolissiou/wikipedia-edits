Following the rise of [[fast food]] and [[take-out]] restaurants, a [[retronym]] for the older \"standard\" restaurant was created, '''sit-down restaurant'''.  Most commonly, \"sit-down restaurant\" refers to a casual-[[dining]] restaurant with [[table service]], rather than a [[fast food restaurant]] or a [[diner]], where one orders food at a [[countertop|counter]]. Sit-down restaurants are often further categorized, in North America, as \"family-style\" or \"[[Full course dinner|formal]]\".\n\nIn [[British English]], the term ''restaurant'' almost always means an eating establishment with table service, so the \"sit down\" qualification is not usually necessary. Fast food and takeaway (take-out) outlets with counter service are not normally referred to as restaurants. Outside North America, the terms fast casual dining restaurants, family style, and casual dining are not used and distinctions among different kinds of restaurants are often not the same. In France, for example, some restaurants are called \"bistros\" to indicate a level of casualness or trendiness, though some \"bistros\" are quite formal in the kind of food they serve and clientele they attract. Others are called \"brasseries\", a term which indicates hours of service. \"Brasseries\" may serve food round the clock, whereas \"restaurants\" usually only serve at set intervals during the day. In Sweden, restaurants of many kinds are called \"restauranger\", but restaurants attached to bars or cafes are sometimes called \"k\u00f6k\", literally \"kitchens\", and sometimes a bar-restaurant combination is called a \"krog\", in English a \"tavern\".\n\nIn ''Dishing It Out: In Search of the Restaurant Experience'',{{full|date=December 2018}} [[Robert Appelbaum]] argues that all restaurants can be categorized according to a set of social parameters defined as polar opposites: high or low, cheap or dear, familiar or exotic, formal or informal, and so forth. Any restaurant will be relatively high or low in style and price, familiar or exotic in the cuisine it offers to different kinds of customers, and so on.

Food is ordered not from the table, but from a front counter (or in some cases, using an electronic terminal). Diners typically then carry their own food from the counter to a table of their choosing, and afterward dispose of any waste from their trays.

Except for buffet-style restaurants, casual dining restaurants typically provide table service. Chain examples include [[Harvester (restaurant)|Harvester]] in the United Kingdom and [[TGI Fridays]] in the United States. Casual dining comprises a market segment between fast-food establishments and fine-dining restaurants. Casual-dining restaurants often have a full bar with separate bar staff, a full beer menu and a limited wine menu. They are frequently, but not necessarily, part of a wider chain, particularly in the US. In Italy, such casual restaurants are often called \"[[trattoria]]\", and are usually independently owned and operated.\n\n===Premium casual===\nPremium casual restaurants originate from Western Canada and include chains such as [[Cactus Club Cafe]], [[Earl's]] and [[JOEY]]. Premium casual restaurants are described as upscale fast casual. Similarly to casual dining, they typically feature a dining room section and a lounge section with multiple screens. They are typically found downtown or in shopping districts. Premium casual restaurants carry a wide range of menu options including burgers, steaks, seafood, pizza, pasta and Asian foods.<!-- This is horribly US-centric. Nowhere in the rest of the world would have this combination, let alone use this term. -->\n\n===Family style===\nFamily style restaurants are a type of casual dining restaurants where food is often served on platters and the diners serve themselves. It can also be used to describe family-friendly diners or casual restaurants. \n\n===Fine dining===\n[[File:The Fat Duck, High Street, Bray - geograph.org.uk - 1271175-MJ.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Fat Duck]], a fine dining destination restaurant in Bray, UK]]\n\nFine dining restaurants are full-service restaurants with specific dedicated meal courses.

In the United States, [[bistros]] usually have more refined decor, fewer tables, finer foods and higher prices. When used in [[English language|English]], the term ''bistro'' usually indicates a [[Continental food|continental]] menu.\n\n===Buffet and sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord===\n{{see also|List of buffet restaurants}}\n[[Buffet]]s and [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord]] offer patrons a selection of food at a fixed price. Food is served on trays around bars, from which customers with plates serve themselves. The selection can be modest or very extensive, with the more elaborate menus divided into categories such as salad, soup, appetizers, hot entr\u00e9es, cold entr\u00e9es, and dessert and fruit. Often the range of cuisine can be eclectic, while other restaurants focus on a specific type, such as home-cooking, Chinese, Indian, or Swedish. The role of the waiter or waitress in this case is relegated to removal of finished plates, and sometimes the ordering and refill of drinks.  In Italy, a kind of semi-buffet is featured in either a tavola calda, serving hot foods, and a tavola fredda, which serves cold food.  Either can be found in bars and cafes at meal times or in dedicated sites, sometimes with seating and service at a counter.\n\n===Caf\u00e9===\n[[File:Byways Cafe (Portland, Oregon).jpg|thumb|right|Byways Cafe in Portland, Oregon, USA]]\n\n[[British cafe]]s and American [[diner]]s are informal eateries offering a range of hot meals and made-to-order sandwiches or rolls.  [[Coffeehouse]]s or caf\u00e9s are not full restaurants, because they primarily serve and derive the majority of their revenue from hot drinks.  Many cafes are open at breakfast time and will serve full hot breakfasts all day. In some areas, cafes offer outdoor seating. The word comes from the French ''caf\u00e9''.\n\n===Cafeteria===\nA [[cafeteria]] is a restaurant serving ready-cooked food arranged behind a food-serving counter.  There is no table service. Typically, a patron takes a tray and pushes it along a track in front of the counter.  Depending on the establishment, servings may be ordered from attendants, selected as ready-made portions already on plates, or self-serve their own portions. Cafeterias are common in hospitals, corporations and educational institutions. In Italy it's very common and known as \"mensa aziendale\".\n\nIn the UK, a cafeteria may also offer a large selection of hot food and the use of the term [[cafeteria]] is deprecated in favour of '''self-service restaurant'''.  Cafeterias have a wider variety of prepared foods. For example, it may have a variety of roasts (e.g. beef, ham, turkey) ready for carving by a server, as well as other main courses, rather than simple offerings of hamburgers or fried chicken.\n\n===Coffee house===\n[[File:The Last Stand Coffee Company.jpg|thumb|right|The Last Stand Coffeehouse, seating optional]]\n{{see also|Tea house}}\n[[Coffeehouse]]s are casual restaurants without table service that emphasize [[coffee]] and other beverages; typically a limited selection of cold foods such as pastries and perhaps sandwiches are offered as well. Their distinguishing feature is that they allow patrons to relax and socialize on their premises for long periods of time without pressure to leave promptly after eating, and are thus frequently chosen as sites for meetings.\n\n===Destination restaurant===\nA '''destination restaurant''' is one that has a strong enough appeal to draw customers from beyond its community.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Make a Destination Restaurant|url=http://www.setupmyrestaurant.com/promotion/destination.htm|work=Setupmyrestaurant.com|accessdate=25 December 2010}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=How to Develop Standard Operating Procedures for Quick Service Restaurant (QSR)?|url=http://www.yourretailcoach.in/blog/how-to-develop-standard-operating-procedures-for-quick-service-restaurant-qsr/|work=yourretailcoach.in|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref> The idea of a destination restaurant originated in France with the [[Michelin Guide]], which rated restaurants as to whether they were worth a special trip or a detour while one travelled by car in France.\n\n===Greasy spoon===\nA [[greasy spoon]] is a colloquial term for a [[British cafe]], [[United States|American]] [[diner]] or other small eatery which tends to serve food at a low cost. Generally fried foods are served, and in the United Kingdom, such places frequently serve all-day breakfasts and strong [[builder's tea]]. They are commonly found in working-class areas.\n\n===Tabletop cooking===\nCustomers are seated as in a casual dining setting. Food items are prepared by the establishments for cooking on embedded [[gas stoves]], [[induction cookers]], or [[charcoal grill]]s; the customer has control over the heating power of the appliance.\n\n===Mongolian barbecue===\nDespite the name, the [[Mongolian barbecue]] form of restaurant is not Mongolian, rather is derived from Taiwan and inspired by Japanese [[teppanyaki]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Customers create a bowl from an assortment of ingredients displayed in a buffet fashion. The bowl is then handed to the cook, who stir-fries the food on a large griddle and returns it on a plate or in a bowl to the consumer.\n\n===Pub===\n{{main|Pub}}\nTraditionally, pubs were primarily drinking establishments with food in a secondary position, whereas many modern pubs rely on food as well, to the point where [[gastropub]]s are often known for their high-quality fine-dining style pub food and concomitantly high prices. A typical pub has a large selection of beers and ales on tap.\n\n===Teppanyaki-style===\nMany restaurants specializing in Japanese cuisine offer the [[teppanyaki]] grill, which is more accurately based on a type of charcoal stove that is called [[shichirin]] in Japan. Diners, often in multiple, unrelated parties, sit around the grill while a chef prepares their food orders in front of them. Often the chef is trained in entertaining the guests with special techniques, including cracking a spinning egg in the air, forming a volcano out of differently-sized onion slices, and flipping grilled shrimp pieces into patrons' mouths, in addition to various props. Also referred to as hibachi.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food|Companies}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[:Category:Restaurants_by_type|Category: Restaurants by Type]]\n* [[Automat]]\n* [[Concession stand]]\n* [[Diner]]\n* [[Dining car]]\n* [[Food trucks]] \n* [[Hot dog stand]]\n* [[Ice cream parlors]]\n* [[Pizzerias]]\n* [[Sandwich bar]]\n* [[Truck stop]]\n* [[Brasserie]]\n* [[Cabmen's Shelter Fund|Cabmen's shelter]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Appelbaum, Robert, ''Dishing It Out: In Search of the Restaurant Experience'' (London: Reaktion, 2011).\n\n{{Lists of restaurants}}\n\n[[Category:Restaurants by type| ]]\n[[Category:Restaurant terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Based upon menu style, preparation methods and pricing, as well by how the food is served}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=September 2010}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2010}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n'''Restaurants''' fall into several industry classifications, based upon menu style, preparation methods and pricing, as well as the means by which the food is served to the customer.\n\n==Origin of categories==\nHistorically, ''restaurant'' referred only to places that provided tables where one ate while seated, typically served by a [[waiter]].

Their distinguishing feature is that they allow patrons to relax and socialize on their premises for long periods of time without pressure to leave promptly after eating, and are thus frequently chosen as sites for meetings.\n\n===Destination restaurant===\nA '''destination restaurant''' is one that has a strong enough appeal to draw customers from beyond its community.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Make a Destination Restaurant|url=http://www.setupmyrestaurant.com/promotion/destination.htm|work=Setupmyrestaurant.com|accessdate=25 December 2010}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=How to Develop Standard Operating Procedures for Quick Service Restaurant (QSR)?|url=http://www.yourretailcoach.in/blog/how-to-develop-standard-operating-procedures-for-quick-service-restaurant-qsr/|work=yourretailcoach.in|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref> The idea of a destination restaurant originated in France with the [[Michelin Guide]], which rated restaurants as to whether they were worth a special trip or a detour while one travelled by car in France.\n\n===Greasy spoon===\nA [[greasy spoon]] is a colloquial term for a [[British cafe]], [[United States|American]] [[diner]] or other small eatery which tends to serve food at a low cost. Generally fried foods are served, and in the United Kingdom, such places frequently serve all-day breakfasts and strong [[builder's tea]]. They are commonly found in working-class areas.\n\n===Tabletop cooking===\nCustomers are seated as in a casual dining setting. Food items are prepared by the establishments for cooking on embedded [[gas stoves]], [[induction cookers]], or [[charcoal grill]]s; the customer has control over the heating power of the appliance.\n\n===Mongolian barbecue===\nDespite the name, the [[Mongolian barbecue]] form of restaurant is not Mongolian, rather is derived from Taiwan and inspired by Japanese [[teppanyaki]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Customers create a bowl from an assortment of ingredients displayed in a buffet fashion. The bowl is then handed to the cook, who stir-fries the food on a large griddle and returns it on a plate or in a bowl to the consumer.\n\n===Pub===\n{{main|Pub}}\nTraditionally, pubs were primarily drinking establishments with food in a secondary position, whereas many modern pubs rely on food as well, to the point where [[gastropub]]s are often known for their high-quality fine-dining style pub food and concomitantly high prices. A typical pub has a large selection of beers and ales on tap.\n\n===Teppanyaki-style===\nMany restaurants specializing in Japanese cuisine offer the [[teppanyaki]] grill, which is more accurately based on a type of charcoal stove that is called [[shichirin]] in Japan. Diners, often in multiple, unrelated parties, sit around the grill while a chef prepares their food orders in front of them. Often the chef is trained in entertaining the guests with special techniques, including cracking a spinning egg in the air, forming a volcano out of differently-sized onion slices, and flipping grilled shrimp pieces into patrons' mouths, in addition to various props. Also referred to as hibachi.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food|Companies}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[:Category:Restaurants_by_type|Category: Restaurants by Type]]\n* [[Automat]]\n* [[Concession stand]]\n* [[Diner]]\n* [[Dining car]]\n* [[Food trucks]] \n* [[Hot dog stand]]\n* [[Ice cream parlors]]\n* [[Pizzerias]]\n* [[Sandwich bar]]\n* [[Truck stop]]\n* [[Brasserie]]\n* [[Cabmen's Shelter Fund|Cabmen's shelter]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Appelbaum, Robert, ''Dishing It Out: In Search of the Restaurant Experience'' (London: Reaktion, 2011).\n\n{{Lists of restaurants}}\n\n[[Category:Restaurants by type| ]]\n[[Category:Restaurant terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Smiguu", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFine dining", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_restaurants"}

That required a totally new fleet of trains to replace the 1959 stock then in use. The plan was made to transfer the 1959 trains to the Northern, to allow the worst of the 1938 stock there to be scrapped, but there were only 76 1959 Tube stock trains, and the Northern line needed more than that to operate. Originally it was planned to refurbish some 30 1938 trains, but this was scrapped in favour of 30 new trains of the 1972 Mark 1 Tube stock.\n\nThe 1972 Tube stock was ordered in a hurry, so there was no time to create a new design; the trains were based on the [[London Underground 1967 Stock|1967 Tube stock]] on the [[Victoria line]]. Although almost identical looking, the 1972 trains had a guard and door controls in the rear car, and were not compatible with 1967 Tube stock (though in later years some 1972 cars were adapted to run with the 1967 trains on the Victoria line).\n\nA further 33 trains of 1972 Tube stock were ordered to provide service on the [[Jubilee line]]. The 1972 Mark 2 stock had slightly different interiors, such as dark blue seating moquette (unlike the red and grey on the earlier 1972/1967 trains). Externally the biggest difference was that the doors were painted red, with a [[London Transport Executive (GLC)|London Transport]] roundel on the side of the carriages, rather than the [[Johnston (typeface)|Johnston]] lettering. Unlike the 1967 or 1972 Mark 1 trains, the train number was displayed on an LED on the drivers desk, in the old trains the number box was implemented into the drivers door. The train number plates on the 1972 Mark 2 trains operated on the Northern and Bakerloo lines prior to the opening of the Jubilee line in 1979. In the 1990s, several Northern Line units were painted in experimental liveries. 3227 was painted with blue doors and a white body, and 3202 was painted in what would become a corporate livery.\n\n[[File:1972Mk2-OriginalLivery-SouthKenton.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Mark II stock in its original form at [[South Kenton station|South Kenton]]]]\nWith the introduction of the [[London Underground 1983 Stock|1983 Tube stock]] on the Jubilee in 1984, the 1972 Mark 2 trains were transferred to the Bakerloo line, where they remain in service. The earlier (Mark 1) 1972 stock on the Northern line was replaced by [[London Underground 1995 Stock|1995 Tube Stock]] in 1999. After being withdrawn from the Northern line, a few cars of 1972 Mark 1 stock were converted to run with 1967 stock in service on the Victoria line. A further two trains were converted to be compatible with the Mark II type, and these now run on the Bakerloo line. One ex Northern line set (3229) is permanently based at the now-closed [[Aldwych tube station|Aldwych station]], for use in films.

The oldest known surviving school bus in the United States, it is based on a 1927 [[Ford Model T]] chassis.]]\nFollowing the first decade of the 20th century, several developments would affect the design of the school bus and student transport.  As vehicles evolved from horse-drawn to \"horseless\" propulsion on a wider basis, the wagon bodies of kid hacks and school cars were adapted to truck frames.  While transitioning into purpose-built designs, a number of features from wagons were retained, including wood construction, perimeter bench seating, and rear entry doors.  Weather protection remained minimal; some designs adopted a [[tarpaulin]] stretched above the passenger seating.\n\nIn 1915, [[International Harvester]] constructed its first school bus<ref name=\"STN Timeline\" />; today, its successor company Navistar still produces school bus cowled chassis.  \n\nIn 1919, the usage of school buses became funded in all 48 U.S. states.<ref name=\"STN Timeline\" />   \n\nIn 1927, Ford dealership owner [[Albert Luce|A.L.

To better adapt automotive chassis design, school bus entry doors were moved from the rear to the front curbside, becoming a door operated by the driver (to ease loading passengers and improve forward visibility).  The rear entry door of the kid hacks were re-purposed (as an emergency exit).    \n\nFollowing the introduction of the steel-paneled 1927 Luce bus, school bus manufacturing began to transition towards all-steel construction.  In 1930<ref name=\"Wayne\" />, both Superior and Wayne introduced all-steel school buses; the latter introduced [[Safety glass|safety glass windows]] for its bus body.\n\nAs school bus design paralleled the design of light to medium-duty commercial trucks of the time, the advent of [[cab over|forward-control trucks]] would have their own influence on school bus design. In an effort to gain extra seating capacity and visibility, [[Crown Coach]] built its own cabover school bus design from the ground up.<ref name=\"Theobald\">Mark Theobald (2004).

Although school bus design had moved away from the wagon-style kid hacks of the generation before, there was not yet an recognized set of industry-wide standards for school buses.  \n\nIn 1939, rural education expert [[Frank W. Cyr|Dr. Frank W. Cyr]] organized a week-long conference at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] that forever changed the design and production of school buses.  Funded by a $5,000 grant, Dr. Cyr invited transportation officials, representatives from body and chassis manufacturers, and paint companies.<ref name=\"Cyr\">[http://www.tc.edu/news/article.htm?id=4057 \"Frank W. Cyr, 'Father of the Yellow School Bus,' Dies at the Age of 95\"]. Columbia University press release (August 3, 1995). Retrieved 2010-04-07</ref>  To reduce the complexity of school bus production and increase safety, a set of 44 standards were agreed upon and adopted by the attendees (such as interior and exterior dimensions and the forward-facing seating configuration).  To allow for large-scale production of school buses among body manufacturers, adoption of these standards allowed for greater consistency among body manufacturers.\n\nWhile many of the standards of the 1939 conference have been modified or updated, one part of its legacy remains a key part of every school bus in North America today: the adoption of a standard paint color for all school buses.

In all but the most isolated areas, [[one-room school]]s from the turn of the century had become phased out in favor of multi-grade schools introduced in urban areas.  In another change, school districts shifted bus operation from buses operated by single individuals to district-owned fleets (operated by district employees).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===1950s\u20131960s  ===\n[[File:REOschoolbus.jpg|thumb|Restored 1950s Reo school bus with an Oneida body]]\n[[File:61thomas.jpg|thumb|1961 International Harvester B-163 with a Thomas Car Works body]]From 1950 to 1982, the [[baby boom generation]] was either in elementary or high school, leading to a significant increase in student populations across North America; this would be a factor that would directly influence school bus production for over  three decades.   \n\nDuring the 1950s, as student populations began to grow, larger school buses began to enter production.  To increase seating capacity (extra rows of seats), manufacturers began to produce bodies on heavier-duty truck chassis; transit-style school buses also grew in size.  In 1954, the first diesel-engined school bus was introduced, with the first tandem-axle school bus in 1955 (a Crown Supercoach, expanding seating to 91 passengers).  \n\nTo improve [[Accessibility#Transportation|accessibility]], at the end of the 1950s, manufacturers developed a curbside [[wheelchair lift]] option to transport wheelchair-using passengers.  In modified form, the design remains in use today.  \n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, manufacturers also began to develop designs for small school buses, optimized for urban routes with crowded, narrow streets along with rural routes too isolated for a full-size bus.  For this role, manufacturers initially began the use of yellow-painted utility vehicles such as the [[International Harvester Travelall|International Travelall]] and [[Chevrolet Suburban]].  As another alternative, manufacturers began use of passenger vans, such as the [[Chevrolet Van|Chevrolet Van/GMC Handi-Van]], [[Dodge A100]], and [[Ford E-Series|Ford Econoline]]; along with yellow paint, these vehicles were fitted with red warning lights.  While more maneuverable, automotive-based school buses did not offer the reinforced passenger compartment of a full-size school bus.    \n\n==== Structural integrity ====\nDuring the 1960s, as with standard passenger cars, concerns began to arise for passenger protection in catastrophic traffic collisions. At the time, the weak point of the body structure was the body joints; where panels and pieces were [[rivet]]ed together, joints could break apart in major accidents, with the bus body causing harm to passengers.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/b/blue_bird/blue_bird.htm|title=Blue Bird, School Bus, History, Blue Bird Body Co., Blue Bird Corp., Wanderlodge, Buddy Luce, Albert L.

In 1973, to reduce the risk of body panel separation, Wayne introduced the [[Wayne Lifeguard]], a school bus body with single-piece body side and roof stampings.  While single-piece stampings seen in the Lifeguard had their own manufacturing challenges, school buses of today use relatively few side panels to minimize body joints.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:Toronto 1978 Financial District (4).jpg|thumb|1970s Wayne Lifeguard]]\nDuring the 1970s, school buses would undergo a number of design upgrades related to safety.  While many changes were related to protecting passengers, others were intended to minimizing the chances of [[traffic collision]]s.  To decrease confusion over traffic priority (increasing safety around school bus stops), federal and state regulations were amended, requiring for many states/provinces to add amber warning lamps inboard of the red warning lamps.  Similar to a yellow traffic light, the amber lights are activated before stopping (at {{Convert|100-300|ft|m|1|abbr=}} distance), indicating to drivers that a school bus is about to stop and unload/load students.  Adopted by a number of states during the mid-1970s, amber warning lights became nearly universal equipment on new school buses by the end of the 1980s.  To supplement the additional warning lights and to help prevent drivers from passing a stopped school bus, a stop arm was added to nearly all school buses; connected to the wiring of the warning lights, the deployable stop arm extended during a bus stop with its own set of red flashing lights.\n\nIn the 1970s, school busing expanded further, under controversial reasons; a number of larger cities began to [[desegregation busing|bus students in an effort to racially integrate schools]].  Out of necessity, the additional usage created further demand for bus production.\n\n==== Industry safety regulations ====\nFrom 1939 to 1973, school bus production was largely self-regulated.  In 1973, the first federal regulations governing school buses went into effect, as FMVSS 217 was required for school buses; the regulation governed specifications of rear emergency exit doors/windows.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />  Following the focus on school bus structural integrity, NHTSA introduced the four ''Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for School Buses,'' applied on April 1, 1977, bringing significant change to the design, engineering, and construction of school buses and a substantial improvement in safety performance.\n\nWhile many changes related to the 1977 safety standards were made under the body structure (to improve [[crashworthiness]]), the most visible change was to passenger seating.  In place of the metal-back passenger seats seen since the 1930s, the regulations introduced taller seats with thick padding on both the front and back, acting as a protective barrier.  Further improvement has resulted from continuing efforts by the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) and [[Transport Canada]], as well as by the bus industry and various safety advocates.  As of 2020 production, all of these standards remain in effect.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stnonline.com/resources/government/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards|title=Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards|work=School Transportation News|date=August 8, 2009|accessdate=2011-06-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927132934/http://www.stnonline.com/resources/government/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards|archivedate=September 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs manufacturers sought to develop safer school buses, small school buses underwent a transition away from automotive-based vehicles. The introduction of [[cutaway van chassis]] allowed bus manufacturers to mate a van cab with a purpose-built bus body, using the same construction as a full-size school bus.  Within the same length as a passenger van, buses such as the [[Wayne Busette]] and [[Blue Bird Micro Bird]] offered additional seating capacity, wheelchair lifts, and the same body construction as larger school buses.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |1973-1977 NHTSA regulations for school buses<ref name=\":6\" />\n|-\n!

As the decade began, the end of the baby-boom generation had finished high school; with a decrease in student population growth, school bus manufacturing was left with a degree of overcapacity.  Coupled with the recession economy of the early 1980s, the decline in demand for school bus production left several manufacturers in financial ruin. To better secure their future, during the 1990s, school bus manufacturers underwent a period of transition, with several ownership changes leading to joint ventures and alignments between body manufacturers and chassis suppliers.\n\nIn 1986, with the signing of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act, school bus drivers across the United States became required to acquire a [[Commercial driver's license|commercial driver's license (CDL)]].  While CDLs were issued by individual states, the federal CDL requirement ensured that drivers of all large vehicles (such as school buses) had a consistent training level.<ref name=\"STN Timeline\"/>\n\nIn contrast to the 1970s focus on structural integrity, design advances during the 1980s and 1990s focused around the driver.  In 1979 and 1980, International Harvester and Ford each introduced a new-generation bus chassis, with General Motors following suit in 1984.  To increase driver visibility, updates in line with chassis redesigns shifted the bus driver upward, outward, and forward.  To decrease driver distraction, interior controls were redesigned with improved [[ergonomics]]; automatic transmissions came into wider use, preventing the risk of stalling (in hazardous places such as intersections or railroad crossings).  Initially introduced during the late 1960s, crossview mirrors came into universal use, improving the view of the blind spots in front of the bus while loading or unloading.  To supplement the rear emergency door in an evacuation, manufacturers introduced additional emergency exits during the 1980s, including roof-mounted escape hatches and outward-opening exit windows.  Side-mounted exit doors (originally introduced on rear-engine buses), became offered on front-engine and conventional-body buses as a supplemental exit.\n\nAlongside safety, body and chassis manufacturers sought to advance fuel economy of school buses.  During the 1980s, diesel engines came into wide use in conventional and small school buses, gradually replacing gasoline-fueled engines.  In 1987, International became the first chassis manufacturer to offer diesel engines exclusively, with Ford following suit in 1990.\n\nWhile conventional-style buses remained the most widely produced full-size school bus, interest in forward visibility, higher seating capacity, and shorter turning radius led to a major expansion of market share of the transit-style configuration, coinciding with several design introductions in the late 1980s.  Following the 1986 introduction of the [[Wayne Lifestar]], the AmTran Genesis, [[Blue Bird TC/2000]], and [[Thomas Saf-T-Liner|Thomas Saf-T-Liner MVP]] would prove far more successful.\n\nDuring the 1990s, small school buses shifted further away from their van-conversion roots.  In 1991, [[Girardin Minibus|Girardin]] launched the MB-II, combining a single rear-wheel van chassis with a full cutaway bus body.  Following the 1992 redesign of the Ford E-Series and the 1997 launch of Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana cutaway chassis, manufacturers followed suit, developing bodies to optimize loading-zone visibility.  As manufacturers universally adopted cutaway bodies for single rear-wheel buses, the use of the [[Dodge Ram van|Dodge Ram Van]] chassis was phased out. By the late 1990s,{{When|date=February 2019}} the United States government banned the use of 15-passenger vans for student transport, leading to the introduction of Multi-Function School Activity Buses (MFSAB). To better protect passengers, MFSABs share the body structure and compartmentalized seating layout of school buses. Not intended (nor allowed) for uses requiring traffic priority, they are not fitted with school bus warning lights or stop arms (nor are they painted school bus yellow).\n\n==== Manufacturer transitions ====\nIn 1980, school buses were manufactured by six body manufacturers (Blue Bird, Carpenter, Superior, Thomas, Ward, Wayne) and three chassis manufacturers (Ford, General Motors, and International Harvester); in California, two manufacturers (Crown and Gillig) manufactured transit-style school buses using proprietary chassis (sold primarily across the West Coast).  From 1980 to 2001, all eight bus manufacturers would undergo periods of struggle and ownership changes.  In 1980, Ward filed for bankruptcy, reorganizing as [[AmTran]] in 1981.  The same year, Superior was liquidated by its parent company, closing its doors. Under its company management, Superior was split into two manufacturers, with [[Mid Bus]] introducing small buses in 1981 and a reorganized Superior producing full-size buses from 1982 to 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105135421/http://www.schoolbuscentral.com/gallery/updates/dec05/sup/1_82ford_lit.htm|title=School Bus Central {{!}} 1982 Superior Ford|date=2011-01-05|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> At the end of 1989, Carpenter would file for bankruptcy, emerging from it in 1990.  In 1991, Crown Coach would close its doors forever; Gillig produced its last school bus in 1993.  Following several ownership changes, Wayne Corporation was liquidated in 1992; successor [[Wayne Wheeled Vehicles]] was closed in 1995. In 2001, Carpenter closed its doors.\n\nDuring the 1990s, as body manufacturers secured their future, family-owned businesses were replaced by subsidiaries as manufacturers underwent mergers, joint ventures, and acquisitions with major chassis suppliers.  In 1991, Navistar began its acquisition of AmTran (fully acquiring it in 1995), phasing out the Ward brand name in 1993.  In 1992, Blue Bird would change hands for the first of several times.  In 1998, Carpenter was acquired by Spartan Motors and Thomas Built Buses was sold to Freightliner; the latter was the final major school bus manufacturer operating under family control.\n\nAlongside the 1981 introduction of Mid Bus, [[Corbeil Bus Corporation|Corbeil]] commenced production in Canada and the United States in 1985.  Following the second (and final) closure of Superior in 1986, New Bus Company acquired the rights to its body design, producing buses from 1988 to 1989.  In 1991, TAM-USA was a joint venture to produce the [[Tovarna avtomobilov Maribor|TAM]] 252 A 121. Assembled in Slovenia with final assembly in California, the TAM vehicle was to be the first American-market school bus imported from Europe.\n\nIn comparison to body manufacturers, chassis suppliers saw a smaller degree of transition.  As International Harvester became [[Navistar International]] in 1986, the company released updated bus chassis for 1989; in 1996, it produced its first rear-engine bus chassis since 1973.  In late 1996, Freightliner produced its first bus chassis, expanding to four manufacturers for the first time since the exit of Dodge in 1977.  Ford and General Motors gradually exited out of cowled-chassis production with Ford producing its last chassis after 1998; General Motors exited the segment after 2003.  Both Ford and GM continue production today, concentrating on cutaway-van chassis.\n\n=== 2000\u2013present ===\n[[File:Blue Bird Vision Montevideo 54.jpg|thumb|Blue Bird Vision (2008-2010)]]\n[[File:2010 Thomas Saf-T-Liner C2.jpg|thumb|Thomas Saf-T-Liner C2]]\nThe beginning of the 21st century would introduce extensive changes to the production of school buses.  Though vehicle assembly saw few direct changes, manufacturer consolidation and industry contraction effectively ended the practice of customers selecting body and chassis manufacturers independently.  While the aspect of customer choice was largely ended (as a result of corporate ownership and supply agreements), decreased complexity paved the way for new product innovations previously thought impossible.   During the 2010s, while diesel engines have remained the primary source of power, manufacturers expanded the availability of alternative-fuel vehicles, including CNG, propane, gasoline, and electric-power buses.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2000s, manufacturers introduced a new generation of conventional-style school buses, coinciding with the redesign of several medium-duty truck lines.  While Ford and General Motors shifted bus production to cutaway chassis, Freightliner and International released new cowled chassis in 2004 and 2005, respectively.  In 2003, Blue Bird introduced the [[Blue Bird Vision|Vision]] conventional; in line with its transit-style buses, the Vision utilized a proprietary chassis (rather than a design from a medium-duty truck).  In 2004, Thomas introduced the [[Thomas Saf-T-Liner C2|Saf-T-Liner C2]] (derived from the [[Freightliner Business Class M2|Freightliner M2]]), with the body designed alongside its chassis (allowing the use of the production Freightliner dashboard).  A trait of both the Vision and C2 (over their predecessors) is improved loading-zone visibility; both vehicles adopted highly sloped hoods and extra glass around the entry door.  In 2005, IC introduced a redesigned CE-series to fit the [[International 3300]] chassis; to improve visibility, the windshield was redesigned (eliminating the center post).      \n\nBetween 2004 and 2008<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0402/p01s03-ussc.html|title=It's a plug-in hybrid \u2013 and it's a school bus|date=2007-04-02|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2019-10-03|issn=0882-7729}}</ref>, [https://www.advancedenergy.org/ Advanced Energy], an NC based non-profit created by the NC Utilities Commission begun an effort to move to plug-in [[Hybrid electric bus|hybrid school buses]].

Using a chassis supplied by [[Spartan Motors]]<ref name=\"lionbus\">{{cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/spartan-chassis-executes-agreement-with-lion-bus-inc-for-type-c-school-bus-chassis-2011-06-16?reflink=MW_news_stmp|title=Spartan Chassis Executes Agreement With Lion Bus Inc. for Type C School Bus Chassis|date=16 June 2011|newspaper=MarketWatch|accessdate=17 June 2011}}</ref>, Lion produces conventional-style school buses, its design features several firsts for school bus production.  Along with a 102-inch body width, to resist corrosion, Lion uses composite body panels in place of steel.  In 2015, Lion introduced the eLion, the first mass-produced school bus with a fully electric powertrain.  \n\nSmall school buses have undergone few fundamental changes to their designs during the 2000s, though the Type B configuration has largely been retired from production.  Following the 1998 sale of the General Motors P-chassis to Navistar subsidiary [[Workhorse Group|Workhorse]], the design began to be phased out in favor of higher-capacity Type A buses.  In 2006, IC introduced the BE200 as its first small school bus; a fully cowled Type B, the BE200 shared much of its body with the CE (on a lower-profile chassis).  In 2010, IC introduced the AE-series, a cutaway-cab school bus (derived from the [[International TerraStar]]).  In 2015, the [[Ford Transit]] cutaway chassis was introduced (alongside the long-running E350/450); initially sold with a Micro Bird body, the Transit has been offered through several manufacturers.  In 2018, the first bus derived from the [[Ram ProMaster]] cutaway chassis was introduced; Collins Bus introduced the Collins Low Floor, the first low-floor school bus (of any configuration).\n\n==== Manufacturing segment stability      ====\nFollowing the 2001 closure of Carpenter, the manufacturing segment has seen a much lower degree of contraction (with the exception of the 2005 failure of startup manufacturer [[Liberty Bus]]).  Following the bankruptcy of Corbeil, the company was acquired at the end of 2007 by Collins, reorganizing it as a subsidiary (alongside Mid Bus) and shifting production to its Kansas facilities.  The same year, U.S. Bus was reorganized as [[Trans Tech]].  In 2008, Starcraft Bus entered the segment, producing school buses on cutaway chassis (a 2011 prototype using a Hino chassis was never produced).  In 2009, Blue Bird and Girardin entered into a joint venture, named Micro Bird; Girardin develops and produces the Blue Bird small-bus product line in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolbusfleet.com/Channel/Management-Training/Articles/2010/02/Q-A-Blue-Bird-Girardin-Join-Forces.aspx|title=Blue Bird, Girardin Join Forces|date=February 19, 2010|work=School Bus Fleet Magazine|accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref>  The 2011 founding of Lion Bus marked the return of bus production to Canada (with the first Canadian-brand full-size buses sold in the United States).  During the 2010s, Collins retired the Mid Bus and Corbeil brands (in 2013 and 2016, respectively).\n\n==== Safety innovations ====\nDuring the 2000s, school bus safety adopted a number of evolutionary advances.  To further improve visibility for other drivers, manufacturers began to replace incandescent lights with [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]<nowiki/>s for running lights, turn signals, brake lights, and warning lamps.  [[School bus crossing arm]]s, first introduced in the late 1990s, came into wider use.  Electronics took on a new role in school bus operation. To increase child safety and security, alarm systems have been developed to prevent children from being left on unattended school buses overnight.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQs/Q: The school bus looks like it's hardly changed in decades.

When making student dropoffs or pickups, traffic law gives school buses priority over other vehicles; in order to stop traffic, they are equipped with flashing lights and a stop sign.\n\nAs a consequence of their size, school buses have a number of blind spots around the outside of the vehicle which can endanger passengers disembarking a bus or pedestrians standing or walking nearby.  To address this safety challenge, a key point of school bus design is focused on exterior visibility, improving the design of bus windows, mirrors, and the windshield to optimize visibility for the driver.  In the case of a collision, the body structure of a school bus is designed with an integral [[roll cage]]; as a school bus carries a large number of student passengers, a school bus is designed with several emergency exits to facilitate fast egress.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, numerous federal and state regulations require school buses to be manufactured as a purpose-built vehicle distinct from other buses.  In contrast to buses in use for public transit, dedicated school buses used for student transport are all [[Single-deck bus|single-deck]], two-axle design ([[Multi-axle bus|multi-axle designs]] are no longer in use).  Outside of North America, buses utilized for student transport are derived from vehicles used elsewhere in transit systems, including coaches, minibuses, and transit buses.\n\n=== Types ===\n[[File:Figure 1- Types of School Buses (32614876865) (3).jpg|thumb|School bus types<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/scschoolfiles/704/fmvss__school_buses.pdf|title=Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stnonline.com/federal-actions/item/1298-school-bus-types|title=School bus types|author=|date=15 October 2009|publisher=School Transportation News|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>|alt=|495x495px]]\nThere are four types of school buses produced by manufacturers in North America.<ref name=\":0\" />   The smallest school buses are designated Type A (based on cutaway van chassis); a larger format (bodied on bare front-engine chassis) are designated Type B buses.

Along with their usage, these buses are distinguished from regular yellow school buses by their exterior design.  \n\nAn \"activity bus\" is a school bus used for providing transportation for students.  In place of home to school route service, an activity bus is primarily used for the purpose for transportation related to extracurricular activities.  Depending on individual state/provincial regulations, the bus used for this purpose can either be a regular yellow school bus or a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Dedicated activity buses, while not painted yellow, are fitted with the similar interiors as well as the same traffic control devices for dropping off students (at other schools); conversely, it cannot be used in regular route service.\n\nA Multi-Function School Activity Bus (MFSAB) is a bus intended for use in both the private sector and the educational system.  While sharing a body structure with a school bus, an MFSAB is not designed for use in route service, as it is not fitted with traffic control devices (i.e., red warning lights, stop arm) nor is it painted school bus yellow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stnonline.com/faqs|title=Why do some school buses look different than others, for example in color?|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101104441/http://www.stnonline.com/faqs|archivedate=2010-01-01|accessdate=2010-05-23}}</ref>  Within the educational system, the design is primarily used for extracurricular activities requiring bus transportation; in the private sector, the MFSAB is intended as an replacement for 15-passenger vans (no longer legal for child transport in either the public or private sector).<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stnonline.com/faqs|title=Are there other vehicles that can be used for school transportation?

In addition to \"School Bus\" signage in the front and rear above the window line, school buses are labeled with the name of the operator (school district or bus contractor) and an identification number.\n\n===== Yellow color =====\n{{Main|school bus yellow}}\nYellow was adopted as the standard color for North American school buses in 1939.  In April of that year, rural education specialist [[Frank W. Cyr]] organized a national conference at [[Columbia University]] to establish production standards for school buses, including a standard exterior color.  The color which became known as \"school bus yellow\" was selected because black lettering on that specific hue was [[Rule of tincture|easiest to see]] in the semi-darkness of early morning and late afternoon.  Officially, school bus yellow was designated \"National School Bus Chrome\"; following the removal of lead from the pigment, it was renamed \"[[school bus yellow|National School Bus Glossy Yellow]]\".\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the association of yellow with school buses has led to its use on school-use buses around the world (although not necessarily required by government specification).  Some areas establishing school transport services have conducted evaluations of American yellow-style school buses;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/784567.stm|title=UK may get yellow school buses|author=Rob Watson|date=June 13, 2000|access-date=April 7, 2010|work=BBC News}}</ref> to better suit local climate conditions, other governments have established their own color requirements, favoring other high-visibility colors (such as white or orange<ref name=\"WA School Bus Specifications including detail on required White Green and Orange Paint Scheme\" /><ref name=\"pro-forma bus supply contract\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/b2b/bus/schedule_8_-_contract_buses_and_contract_depots.pdf|title=Sydney Metropolitan Bus Service Contract-Schedule 8|access-date=October 20, 2013}}</ref>).  [[File:School Bus Yard Reflection.jpg|thumb|Reflective tape on school buses (brightened by camera flash)]]\n\n===== Retroreflective markings =====\nWhile its yellow exterior makes it more conspicuous than other vehicles, a school bus can remain hard to see in some low-visibility conditions, including sunrise or sunset, poor weather (all seasons), and in rural areas.  To further improve their visibility (to other vehicles), many state and provincial governments (for example, Colorado)<ref>[http://www.cde.state.co.us/cdenutritran/download/word/TransARM/TR-49Attach.doc Colorado Minimum Standards Governing School Bus Transportation Vehicles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928190556/http://www.cde.state.co.us/cdenutritran/download/word/TransARM/TR-49Attach.doc|date=2011-09-28}} Colorado Code of Regulations 301-25, Section 2251-R-54.02.

Marking the length, width, height, and in some cases, identifying the bus as a school bus, reflective tape makes the vehicle easier to see in low light, also marking all emergency exits (so rescue personnel can quickly find them in darkness).<ref>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/get-cfr.cgi?TITLE=49&PART=571&SECTION=217&TYPE=TEXT Bus emergency exits and window retention and release] Code of Federal Regulations Title 49, Section 571.217. Retrieved 2010-04-15</ref>  Other requirements include reflective \"School Bus\" lettering (or the use of a front-lighted sign). \n\nThe equivalent requirement in Canada is almost identical; the only difference is that red cannot be used as a retroreflective color.\n\n==== Safety devices ====\nTo comply with federal and state requirements, school buses are equipped with a number of safety devices to prevent accidents and injuries and for the purposes of security.\n\n===== Mirror systems =====\n[[File:Inside View of School Bus.jpg|thumb|View behind school bus driver's compartment, showing multiple mirrors (rearview, convex, and crossview) and sun visor|alt=]]\n[[File:School Bus Xview.jpg|thumb|Vision field of a school bus crossview mirror, which allows bus driver to observe blind spots close to vehicle.  |alt=]]\n\nWhen driving and when loading/unloading students, a key priority for a school bus driver is maintaining proper sightlines around their vehicle; the blind spots formed by the school bus can be a significant risk to bus drivers and traffic as well as pedestrians. \n\nIn the United States, approximately <big>\u2154</big> of students killed outside of the school bus are not struck by other vehicles, but by their own bus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autos.groups.yahoo.com/group/WayneBusEnthusiasts/files/|title=Protecting Children from Their Own Buses by Mark D. Fisher|accessdate=January 29, 2006}}</ref>  To combat this problem, school buses are specified with sophisticated and comprehensive mirror systems.  In redesigns of school bus bodies, driver visibility and overall sightlines have become important considerations.  In comparison to school buses from the 1980s, school buses from the 2000s have much larger windscreens and fewer and/or smaller blind spots.\n\n=====Emergency exits=====\n[[File:05schoolbusachter.jpg|thumb|Typical school bus rear emergency exit door]]\nFor the purposes of evacuation, school buses are equipped with a minimum of at least one emergency exit (in addition to the main entry door).  The rear-mounted emergency exit door is a design feature adopted from horse-drawn wagons (the entrance was rear-mounted to avoid disturbing the horses); in rear-engine school buses, the door is replaced by an exit window mounted above the engine compartment (supplemented by a side-mounted exit door).  Additional exits may be located in the roof (roof hatches), window exits, and/or side emergency exit doors. All are opened by the use of quick-release latches which activate an alarm.\n\nThe number of emergency exits in a school bus is dependent on its seating capacity and also varies by individual state/provincial requirements.  The most currently installed is eight; Kentucky requires a rear exit door (or window, for rear-engine buses), a left-side exit door, four exit windows, and two roof-mounted exit hatches.\n\n=====Video surveillance=====\nSince the 1990s, video cameras have become common equipment installed inside school buses.  As recording technology has transitioned from [[VHS]] to [[Digital camera|digital cameras]], school buses have adopted multiple-camera systems, providing surveillance from multiple vantage points. \n\nWhile primarily used to monitor and record passenger behavior, video cameras have also been used in the investigation of accidents involving school buses.  On March 28, 2000, a [[Murray County, Georgia]], school bus was hit by a [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] freight train at an unsignaled [[level crossing|railroad crossing]]; three children were killed.  The bus driver claimed to have stopped and looked for approaching trains before proceeding across the tracks, as is required by law, but the onboard camera recorded that the bus had in fact not stopped.<ref>[https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/HAR0103.aspx Highway Accident Report \u2013 NTSB/HAR-01/03] National Transportation Safety Board (December 11, 2001). Retrieved 2019-09-18</ref>\n\nIn the 2010s, exterior-mounted cameras synchronized with the stop arms have come into use.  The cameras photograph vehicles that illegally pass the bus when its stop arm and warning lights are in use (thus committing a moving violation).\n\n====Restraint systems====\nIn contrast to cars and other light-duty passenger vehicles, school buses are not typically equipped with active restraint systems, such as [[seat belt]]s; whether seat belts should be a requirement has been a topic of controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stnonline.com/resources/seat-belts/related-seat-belt-articles/264-napt-advocates-scientific-approach-to-seat-belt-issue|title=NAPT Advocates Scientific Approach to Seat Belt Issue|author=Janna Morrison|date=August 8, 2008|publisher=School Transportation News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716144919/http://www.stnonline.com/resources/seat-belts/related-seat-belt-articles/264-napt-advocates-scientific-approach-to-seat-belt-issue|archive-date=2011-07-16|url-status=|accessdate=2010-04-16}}</ref>  Since the 1970s, school buses have used the concept of [[compartmentalization (engineering)|compartmentalization]] as a passive restraint system<ref name=\"Compartmentalization\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.stnonline.com/resources/seat-belts/compartmentalization|title=Compartmentalization|date=2012-02-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202044820/http://www.stnonline.com/resources/seat-belts/compartmentalization|archivedate=2012-02-02|url-status=bot: unknown|access-date=2016-09-05}}</ref>; during the late 2000s and 2010s, seatbelt design transitioned, with 3-point restraints replacing lap belts.  \n\nAs of 2015, seatbelts are a requirement in at least five states:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehour.com/story/482394|title=Connecticut considers installing seat belts on school buses|author=Susan Haigh|date=February 17, 2010|publisher=The Hour Online|accessdate=2010-04-16}}</ref> [[California]], [[Florida]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Texas]]; Canada does not require their installation (at the provincial level).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010055207/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/roadsafety/tp-tp13330-bussch_e-245.htm#belts|title=Review of Bus Safety Issues - School Bus Passenger Protection - Review of Bus Safety Issues - Abstract & Index - Road & Motor Vehicle Safety Publications - Road and Motor Vehicle Safety - Road Transportation - Transport Canada|date=2009-10-10|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref>  Of the states that equip buses with two-point lap seat belts (Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey and New York), only New Jersey requires seat belt usage by riders.<ref>[http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/roadsafety/tp-tp13330-bussch_e-245.htm#belts Seat Belts in School Buses] Transport Canada. Retrieved 2010-04-19</ref> In other states, it is up to the district or operator whether to require riders to use them or not.\n\n===== Passive restraints (compartmentalization) =====\nAccording to the National Highway Transportation Association (NHTSA), studies completed previously on school buses showed that due to their size and heaviness, school buses did not require that safety belts be in place. Information gathered in previous studies showed that a size of a bus, combined with the design of the seat and the material the in the space between the seats themselves, showed that there was no need of safety belts on a school bus.  A bus is larger and heavier than a normal size passenger vehicle and could distribute the force of the crash evenly. Combined with the space between the seats as well as the design prevented serious injuries from happening.  This attribute, does not carry over to a small bus due to its lesser size; buses with a GVWR under 10,000 pounds are required to have safety belts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/road-safety/school-bus-safety|title=School Bus Safety|last=amy.lee.ctr@dot.gov|date=2016-09-09|website=NHTSA|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref>  \n\nHowever, recent accidents involving school buses that have caused serious (if not fatal) injuries have caused the National Transportation Safety Board to conduct new tests to check the legitimacy of this continued practice. After completing these tests due to bus accidents in 2016, they have recommended that new buses being built need to have both a lap and shoulder harness in place. They have also recommended that 42 states add seat belts as a requirement. There are some states that have already added the lap belt. This study made the NTSB recommend adding shoulder harnesses to those states that already have a lap belt in place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/Pages/schoolbuses.aspx|title=NTSB School Bus Safety|website=www.ntsb.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Busseats red.jpg|thumb|School bus seats ''(rear view)''. Part of the premise behind compartmentalization is close spacing of each set of seats.]]\n\nIn 1967 and 1972, as part of an effort to improve crash protection in school buses, [[UCLA]] researchers played a role in the future of school bus interior design.  Using the metal-backed seats then in use as a means of comparison, several new seat designs were researched in crash testing.  In its conclusion, the UCLA researchers found that the safest design was a 28-inch high padded seatback spaced a maximum of 24 inches apart, using the concept of compartmentalization as a passive restraint.<ref name=\"Compartmentalization\" />  While the UCLA researchers found the compartmentalized seats to be the safest design, they found active restraints (such as seatbelts) to be next in terms of importance of passenger safety.<ref name=\"Compartmentalization\" />  In 1977, FMVSS 222 mandated a change to compartmentalized seats, though the height requirement was lowered to 24 inches.<ref name=\"School Bus Seat Belts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stnonline.com/faqs|title=School Bus Seat Belts|work=School Transportation News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101104441/http://www.stnonline.com/faqs|archivedate=2010-01-01|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-04-16}}</ref>  According to the NTSB, the main disadvantage of passive-restraint seats is its lack of protection in side-impact collisions (with larger vehicles) and rollover situations.<ref name=\"Compartmentalization\" />  Though by design, students are protected front to back by compartmentalization, it allows the potential for ejection in other crash situations (however rare).<ref name=\"Compartmentalization\" />\n\n===== Active restraints (seatbelts) =====\n''Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 222'' was introduced in 1977, requiring passive restraints and more stringent structural integrity standards; as part of the legislation, seatbelts were exempted from school buses with a gross vehicle weight (GVWR) exceeding 10,000 pounds.   \n\nIn 1987, New York became the first state to require seatbelts on full-size school buses (raising the seat height to 28 inches); the requirement did not mandate their use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202051940/http://www.stnonline.com/resources/seat-belts/the-history-of-seat-belt-development|title=The History of Seat Belt Development|date=2012-02-02|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref>  In 1992, New Jersey followed suit, becoming the first state to require their use<ref name=\":7\" />, remaining the only state to do so.

This had become \"the most widely cited study\" in North America, according to U.S. regulators, and was frequently quoted for decades by school boards and bus manufacturers across the continent as a reason not to install seat belts. Transport Canada has stuck to its stance against installing seat belts on school buses, despite numerous newer studies and actual accidents showing that compartmentalization could not protect against side impacts, rollovers, and being rear-ended; which would have been avoided by implementing [[Seat belt#Three-point|three-point seat belts]] that would have kept occupants from being thrown from their seats.<ref>https://www.cbc.ca/fifth/episodes/2018-2019/unbuckled-school-bus-safety</ref><ref>https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/school-bus-seatbelts-1.4826500</ref>\n\n== School bus manufacture ==\nIn most cases, school buses are assembled by [[second stage manufacturer]]s, mating a bus body with a second-party chassis.  Some school buses (typically those of Type D configuration) are produced with both body and chassis from the same manufacturer.\n\nIn 2018, 44,381 school buses were sold in North America (compared to 31,194 in 2010).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://files.schoolbusfleet.com/stats/SBFFB19-sales.pdf|website=files.schoolbusfleet.com|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref>  Approximately 70% of production is of Type C configuration.\n\n===Production (North America)===\n{{mainlist|List of school bus manufacturers}}\nIn the United States and Canada, school buses are currently produced by nine different manufacturers.  Four of them\u2014[[Collins Industries]], [[Starcraft Bus]], [[Trans Tech]], and [[Van Con]] \u2014 specialize exclusively in small buses.  [[Thomas Built Buses]] and [[Blue Bird Corporation]] (the latter, through its Micro Bird joint venture with [[Girardin Minibus|Girardin]])\u2014produce both small and large buses.  IC Bus and Lion Electric produce full-size buses exclusively.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Canada was home to satellite facilities of several U.S. firms (Blue Bird, Thomas, Wayne), exporting production across North America, with other production imported from the United States.  Domestically, [[Corbeil Buses|Corbeil]] manufactured full-size and small school buses (1985-2007) and Girardin produced small buses.  In 2011, Lion Bus (today, Lion Electric Company/ La Compagnie \u00c9lectrique Lion) was founded as a Quebec-based manufacturer of full-size buses, shifting development to fully-electric vehicles.  \n\n== Operations ==\nEvery year in the United States and Canada, school buses provide an estimated 8 billion student trips from home and school.  Each school day in 2015, nearly 484,000 school buses transported 26.9 million children to and from school and school-related activities; over half of the United States K\u201312 student population is transported by school bus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digital.schoolbusfleet.com/2016FB/Default/16/1/2918502#&pageSet=19|title=School Bus Fleet, Factbook 2016|website=digital.schoolbusfleet.com|access-date=2016-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanschoolbuscouncil.org/index.php?page=faq#a_5|title=FAQs|publisher=American School Bus Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225071413/http://www.americanschoolbuscouncil.org/index.php?page=faq#a_5|archivedate=2010-12-25|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372|title=National Center for Education Statistics{{!}}Fast Facts|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref>  Outside North America, purpose-built vehicles for student transport are less common.  Depending on location, students ride to school on transit buses (on school-only routes), [[Coach (bus)|coaches]], or a variety of other buses.\n\nWhile school bus operations vary widely by location, in the United States and Canada, school bus services operate independent of [[Public transport bus service|public transport]], with their own [[bus stop]]s and schedules, coordinated with school class times.\n\n=== Licensing ===\nSchool bus drivers in the United States are required to hold a [[commercial driver's license]] (CDL).  Full-size school buses are generally considered Class B vehicles; most van-based school buses are considered Class C vehicles.  In addition to a standard P (passenger) endorsement, school bus drivers must acquire a separate S (school bus) endorsement; along with a written and driving test, the endorsement requires a [[Background check#United States|background check]] and [[Sex offender registries in the United States|sex offender registry check]].\n\n===Loading and unloading===\n[[File:Children about to board the school bus (Thibodaux, Louisiana).jpg|alt=|thumb|School bus at bus stop with 8-way warning lights, dual stop arms, and [[School bus crossing arm|crossing arm]] ]]\nCoinciding with their seating configuration, school buses have a higher seating capacity than buses of a similar length; a typical full-size school bus can carry from 66 to 90 passengers.  In contrast to a transit bus, school buses are equipped with a single entry door at the front of the bus.  Several configurations of entry doors are used on school buses, including center-hinged (jack-knife) and outward-opening.  Prior to the 2000s, doors operated manually by the driver were the most common, with air or electric-assist becoming nearly universal in current vehicles.\n\nSchool bus routes are designed with multiple bus stops, allowing for the loading (unloading) of several students at a time; the stop at school is the only time that the bus loads (unloads) passengers at once.\n\nTo inhibit pedestrians from walking into the blind spot created by the hood (or lower bodywork, on Type D buses), [[school bus crossing arm|crossing arms]] are safety devices that extend outward from the front bumper when the bus is stopped for loading or unloading.<ref>[http://www.schoolbusfleet.com/Channel/School-Bus-Safety/Articles/2007/09/Improving-Safety-in-the-Danger-Zone.aspxImproving Safety in the Danger Zone] School Bus Fleet (September 1, 2007). Retrieved 2010-04-19</ref>  By design, these force passengers to walk forward several feet forward of the bus (into the view of the driver) before they can cross the road in front of the bus.\n\nIn the past, handrails in the entry way posed a potential risk for to students; as passengers exited a bus, items such as [[drawstring]]s or other loose clothing could be caught if the driver was unaware and pulled away with the student caught in the door. To minimize this risk, school bus manufacturers have redesigned handrails and equipment in the stepwell area.  In its ''School Bus Handrail Handbook'', the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] described a simple test procedure for identifying unsafe stepwell handrails.<ref>[http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/buses/handrail/handrail.html#Mechanics Handrail Mechanics] ''School Bus Handrail Handbook''.

For the same reason, adult [[crossing guard]]s often are deployed in walking zones between homes and schools.\n* It is impractical in many cases to avoid children crossing the traveled portions of roadways after leaving a school bus or to have an adult accompany them.\n* The size of a school bus generally limits visibility for both the children and motorists during loading and unloading.\n\nSince at least the mid-1970s, all U.S. states and Canadian provinces and territories have some sort of school bus traffic stop law; although each jurisdiction requires traffic to stop for a school bus loading and unloading passengers, different jurisdictions have different requirements of when to stop. Outside of North America, the school bus stopping traffic to unload and load children is not provided for. Instead of being given traffic priority, fellow drivers are encouraged to drive with extra caution around school buses.\n\n====Warning lights and stop arms====\n[[File:Maine School bus stop.jpg|thumb|School bus with red warning lights and deployed stop arm]]\nAround 1946, the first system of traffic warning signal lights on school buses was used in [[Virginia]], consisting of a pair of sealed beam lights.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  Instead of colorless glass lenses (similar to car headlamps), the warning lamps utilized red lenses.  A motorized rotary switch applied power alternately to the red lights mounted at the left and right of the front and rear of the bus, creating a [[wig-wag (automobile)|wig-wag effect]].  Activation was typically through a mechanical switch attached to the door control. However, on some buses (such as Gillig's Transit Coach models and the Kenworth-Pacific School Coach) activation of the roof warning lamp system was through the use of a pressure-sensitive switch on a manually controlled stop paddle lever located to the left of the driver's seat below the window. Whenever the pressure was relieved by extending the stop paddle, the electric current was activated to the relay.  In the 1950s, plastic lenses were developed for the warning lenses, though the warning lights (with colorless glass lenses) used sealed-beam lamps into the mid-2000s, when light-emitting diodes [[Automotive lighting#Light emitting diodes (LED)|(LEDs)]] came into use.\n\nThe warning lamps initially used for school buses consisted of four red warning lights.  With the adoption of [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108|FMVSS 108]] in January 1968, four additional warning lights were gradually added to school buses; these were amber in color and mounted inboard of the red warning lights.<ref name=\"FMVSS 108\">{{cite journal|title=Code of Federal Regulations Title 49, Volume 6, Section 571.108|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title49-vol6/pdf/CFR-2011-title49-vol6-sec571-108.pdf|pages=361}}</ref> Intended to signal an upcoming stop to drivers, as the entry door was opened at the stop, they were wired to be overridden by the red lights and the stop sign.<ref name=\"FMVSS 108\" /> Although 8-light systems were adopted by many states and provinces during the 1970s and 1980s, the all-red systems remain in use by some locales such as [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Ontario, Canada]], older buses from [[California]], as well as on buses built in [[Wisconsin]] before 2005.<ref>[https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/347/II/25/2 Wisconsin Legislature 347.25 (2)] Wisconsin Statutues  Chapter 347 (EQUIPMENT OF VEHICLES) Retrieved 2016-09-18</ref>\n\nTo aid visibility of the bus in inclement weather, school districts and school bus operators add flashing [[strobe light]]s to the roof of the bus.

Retrieved 2010-04-16</ref> require strobe lights as part of their local specifications.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, states began to specify a mechanical stop signal arm which the driver would deploy from the left side of the bus to warn traffic of a stop in progress. The portion of the stop arm protruding in front of traffic was initially a trapezoidal shape with {{smallcaps|stop}} painted on it. The U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]'s [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards|Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard]] No. 131 regulates the specifications of the stop arm as a double-faced regulation octagonal red [[stop sign]] at least {{convert|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} across, with white border and uppercase legend.

Along with newly produced vehicles, conversions of retired school buses see a large range of uses.  Qualities desired from school buses involve sturdy construction (as school buses have an all-steel body and frame), a large seating capacity, and wheelchair lift capability, among others.\n\n=== School bus derivatives ===\n\n==== Church use ====\n[[File:Church bus Highland Heights United Methodist Church Memphis TN 06.jpg|alt=|thumb|Church bus in Memphis, Tennessee]]\nChurches throughout the United States and Canada use buses to transport their congregants, both to church services and events.  A wide variety of buses are owned by churches, depending on needs and affordability.  Larger buses may often be derived from school buses (newly purchased or second-hand).  Other churches often own [[minibus]]es, often equipped with wheelchair lifts.  When school bus derivatives are used, church bus livery is dictated by federal regulations, which require the removal of \"School Bus\" lettering and the disabling/removal of stop arms/warning lights.<ref name=\"Safety Guidelines\" />  In some states, School Bus Yellow must be painted over entirely.  \n\nIn church use, transporting adults and/or children, traffic law does not give church buses traffic priority in most states ([[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Virginia]] being the only states where a church bus can stop traffic with flashing red lights<ref>{{cite web|url=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-917.1/|title=LIS \u00a7 46.2\u2013917.1.

Along with buses with high-capacity seating serving as officer transports (in large-scale deployments), other vehicles derived from buses may have little seating, serving as temporary mobile command centers; these vehicles are built from school bus bodyshells and fitted with agency-specified equipment.\n\n[[Prisoner transport vehicle]]s are high-security vehicles used to transport prisoners; a school bus bodyshell is fitted with a specially designed interior and exterior with secure windows and doors.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Union Tpke 164th St td (2018-05-18) 01 - NYPD Medical Bus.jpg|NYPD Medical Operations bus (Thomas EFX)\nFile:NYCPD Command Post 4077.jpg|NYPD Command Post bus (Blue Bird A3RE)\nFile:St Johns County Sheriff Dept FL (5).jpg|St. John's County (FL) Command Center bus (1980s Blue Bird All American), curbside view\n</gallery>\n\n=== Uses of retired school buses ===\nAs of 2016, the average age of a school bus in the United States is 9.3 years.<ref name=\"SBF factbook\">{{cite web|url=http://digital.schoolbusfleet.com/2016FB/Default/16/1/2918502#&pageSet=23|title=School Bus Fleet Factbook 2016|pages=46\u201350|accessdate=26 January 2016}}</ref>  School buses can be retired from service due to a number of factors, including vehicle age or mileage, mechanical condition, emissions compliance, or any combination of these factors.<ref name=\"SBF factbook\" />  In some states and provinces, school bus retirement is called for at specific age or mileage intervals, regardless of mechanical condition.  In recent years, budget concerns in many publicly funded school districts have necessitated that school buses be kept in service longer.\n\nWhen a school bus is retired from school use, it can see a wide variety of usage.  While a majority are [[Vehicle recycling|scrapped]] for parts and recycling (a requirement in some states), better-running examples are put up for sale as surplus vehicles.  Second-hand school buses are sold to such entities as churches, resorts or [[summer camp]]s; others are exported to Central America, South America, or elsewhere.  Other examples of retired school buses are preserved and restored by collectors and [[bus enthusiast]]s; collectors and museums have an interest in older and rarer models.  Additionally, restored school buses appear alongside other period vehicles in television or film.\n\nWhen a school bus is sold for usage outside of student transport, [[NHTSA]] regulations require that its identification as a school bus be removed.<ref name=\"Safety Guidelines\" />  To do so, all school bus lettering must be removed or covered while the exterior must be painted a color different than school bus yellow; the stop arm(s) and warning lamps must be removed or disabled.<ref name=\"Safety Guidelines\" />\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:1942 Chevrolet bus Gillig body.jpg|1942 Gillig/Chevrolet in use as a tour bus\nFile:1946 Chevrolet School Bus \"SoKool Bus\".jpg|1946 Chevrolet school bus restored and customized\nFile:The Gator Bus.jpg|The \"Gator Bus\", a 1960s Wayne/Chevrolet school bus repurposed as a sign for an alligator park in Louisiana \nFile:Dubois County Bombers bus.JPG|1980s Crown Supercoach restored, painted to match the bus from ''[[A League of Their Own]]''\nFile:2018-08-19 Former Blue Bird TC2000 school bus at Jasper, AB 0698.jpg|Retired school bus (Blue Bird TC/2000) in use as a rafting shuttle\n</gallery><br />\n\n====School bus conversions====\nIn retirement, not all school buses live on as transport vehicles.  In contrast, the purchasers of school buses use the large body and chassis to use as either a working vehicle, or as a basis to build a rolling home.  To build a utility vehicle for farms, owners often remove much of the roof and sides, creating a large flatbed or open-bed truck for hauling hay.  Other farms use unconverted, re-painted, school buses to transport their [[workforce]].\n\n[[List of recreational vehicles#Bus conversion|Skoolies]] are retired school buses converted into [[recreational vehicle]]s (the term also applies to their owners and enthusiasts).  Constructed and customized by their owners; while some examples have primitive accommodations, others rival the features of production RVs.  Exteriors vary widely, including only the removal of school bus lettering, conservative designs, or the bus equivalent of an [[art car]].  An example of a Skoolie is [[Further (bus)|Further]], a 1939 (and later, 1947) school bus converted by [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]], intended for use on cross-country counterculture road trips.  Both versions of Further are painted with a variety of psychedelic colors and designs.  <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Burning Man 2013 Cargo Cult (3).jpg|1990s school bus conversion at 2013 [[Burning Man]]\nFile:Further-1.jpg|Further (1947 version)\nFile:Further-2.jpg|Further (1947 version), rear\nFile:Further-1-2.jpg|Both versions of Further (1939 at right)\n</gallery><br />\n\n===School bus export===\nRetired school buses from Canada and the United States are sometimes exported to Africa, Central America, South America, or elsewhere. Used as public transportation between communities, these buses are nicknamed \"[[chicken bus]]es\" for both their crowded accommodation and the (occasional) transportation of livestock alongside passengers.  To attract passengers (and fares), yellow buses are often repainted with flamboyant exterior color schemes and modified with chrome exterior trim.\n\n==Around the world==\n{{main|School bus by country}}Outside the United States and Canada, the usage and design of buses for student transport varies worldwide.  In Europe, Asia, and Australia, buses utilized for student transport may be derived from standard transit buses.

As vehicles evolved from horse-drawn to \"horseless\" propulsion on a wider basis, the wagon bodies of kid hacks and school cars were adapted to truck frames.  While transitioning into purpose-built designs, a number of features from wagons were retained, including wood construction, perimeter bench seating, and rear entry doors.  Weather protection remained minimal; some designs adopted a [[tarpaulin]] stretched above the passenger seating.\n\nIn 1915, [[International Harvester]] constructed its first school bus<ref name=\"STN Timeline\" />; today, its successor company Navistar still produces school bus cowled chassis.  \n\nIn 1919, the usage of school buses became funded in all 48 U.S. states.<ref name=\"STN Timeline\" />   \n\nIn 1927, Ford dealership owner [[Albert Luce|A.L.

To better adapt automotive chassis design, school bus entry doors were moved from the rear to the front curbside, becoming a door operated by the driver (to ease loading passengers and improve forward visibility).  The rear entry door of the kid hacks were re-purposed (as an emergency exit).    \n\nFollowing the introduction of the steel-paneled 1927 Luce bus, school bus manufacturing began to transition towards all-steel construction.  In 1930<ref name=\"Wayne\" />, both Superior and Wayne introduced all-steel school buses; the latter introduced [[Safety glass|safety glass windows]] for its bus body.\n\nAs school bus design paralleled the design of light to medium-duty commercial trucks of the time, the advent of [[cab over|forward-control trucks]] would have their own influence on school bus design. In an effort to gain extra seating capacity and visibility, [[Crown Coach]] built its own cabover school bus design from the ground up.<ref name=\"Theobald\">Mark Theobald (2004).

Although school bus design had moved away from the wagon-style kid hacks of the generation before, there was not yet an recognized set of industry-wide standards for school buses.  \n\nIn 1939, rural education expert [[Frank W. Cyr|Dr. Frank W. Cyr]] organized a week-long conference at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] that forever changed the design and production of school buses.  Funded by a $5,000 grant, Dr. Cyr invited transportation officials, representatives from body and chassis manufacturers, and paint companies.<ref name=\"Cyr\">[http://www.tc.edu/news/article.htm?id=4057 \"Frank W. Cyr, 'Father of the Yellow School Bus,' Dies at the Age of 95\"]. Columbia University press release (August 3, 1995). Retrieved 2010-04-07</ref>  To reduce the complexity of school bus production and increase safety, a set of 44 standards were agreed upon and adopted by the attendees (such as interior and exterior dimensions and the forward-facing seating configuration).  To allow for large-scale production of school buses among body manufacturers, adoption of these standards allowed for greater consistency among body manufacturers.\n\nWhile many of the standards of the 1939 conference have been modified or updated, one part of its legacy remains a key part of every school bus in North America today: the adoption of a standard paint color for all school buses. While technically named \"National School Bus Glossy Yellow\", [[school bus yellow]] was adopted for use since it was considered [[rule of tincture|easiest to see]] in dawn and dusk, and it contrasted well with black lettering.<ref name=\"Cyr\" /> While not universally used worldwide, yellow has become the shade most commonly associated with school buses both in North America and abroad.<ref name=\"School bus safety report showing blue and white bus on cover as is normal for NSW, proving that yellow is universal associated only in the minds of Americans\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/b2b/bus/m236-school-bus-safety-report_web.pdf|title=School Bus Safety Community Advisory Committee|accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref><ref name=\"WA School Bus Specifications including detail on required White Green and Orange Paint Scheme\">{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolbuses.wa.gov.au/Portals/0/Contractor/PDF/School%20Bus%20Specifications%20September%202013.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021041542/http://www.schoolbuses.wa.gov.au/Portals/0/Contractor/PDF/School%20Bus%20Specifications%20September%202013.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-10-21|title=WA School Bus Specifications 20 September 2013|accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref>\n\n===1940s===\nDuring World War II, school bus manufacturers converted to military production, manufacturing buses and license-built trucks for the military.<ref name=\"Wayne\" /><ref name=\"STN Timeline\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\"Theobald\" />  Following the war, school bus operation would see a number of changes, following developments within education systems.  \n\nFollowing World War II and the [[Suburb#North America|rise of suburban growth in North America]], demand for school busing increased outside of rural areas; in suburbs and larger urban areas, community design often made walking to school impractical beyond a certain distance from home (particularly as students progressed into high school).  In all but the most isolated areas, [[one-room school]]s from the turn of the century had become phased out in favor of multi-grade schools introduced in urban areas.  In another change, school districts shifted bus operation from buses operated by single individuals to district-owned fleets (operated by district employees).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===1950s\u20131960s  ===\n[[File:REOschoolbus.jpg|thumb|Restored 1950s Reo school bus with an Oneida body]]\n[[File:61thomas.jpg|thumb|1961 International Harvester B-163 with a Thomas Car Works body]]From 1950 to 1982, the [[baby boom generation]] was either in elementary or high school, leading to a significant increase in student populations across North America; this would be a factor that would directly influence school bus production for over  three decades.   \n\nDuring the 1950s, as student populations began to grow, larger school buses began to enter production.  To increase seating capacity (extra rows of seats), manufacturers began to produce bodies on heavier-duty truck chassis; transit-style school buses also grew in size.  In 1954, the first diesel-engined school bus was introduced, with the first tandem-axle school bus in 1955 (a Crown Supercoach, expanding seating to 91 passengers).  \n\nTo improve [[Accessibility#Transportation|accessibility]], at the end of the 1950s, manufacturers developed a curbside [[wheelchair lift]] option to transport wheelchair-using passengers.  In modified form, the design remains in use today.  \n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, manufacturers also began to develop designs for small school buses, optimized for urban routes with crowded, narrow streets along with rural routes too isolated for a full-size bus.  For this role, manufacturers initially began the use of yellow-painted utility vehicles such as the [[International Harvester Travelall|International Travelall]] and [[Chevrolet Suburban]].  As another alternative, manufacturers began use of passenger vans, such as the [[Chevrolet Van|Chevrolet Van/GMC Handi-Van]], [[Dodge A100]], and [[Ford E-Series|Ford Econoline]]; along with yellow paint, these vehicles were fitted with red warning lights.  While more maneuverable, automotive-based school buses did not offer the reinforced passenger compartment of a full-size school bus.    \n\n==== Structural integrity ====\nDuring the 1960s, as with standard passenger cars, concerns began to arise for passenger protection in catastrophic traffic collisions. At the time, the weak point of the body structure was the body joints; where panels and pieces were [[rivet]]ed together, joints could break apart in major accidents, with the bus body causing harm to passengers.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/b/blue_bird/blue_bird.htm|title=Blue Bird, School Bus, History, Blue Bird Body Co., Blue Bird Corp., Wanderlodge, Buddy Luce, Albert L.

In 1973, to reduce the risk of body panel separation, Wayne introduced the [[Wayne Lifeguard]], a school bus body with single-piece body side and roof stampings.  While single-piece stampings seen in the Lifeguard had their own manufacturing challenges, school buses of today use relatively few side panels to minimize body joints.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:Toronto 1978 Financial District (4).jpg|thumb|1970s Wayne Lifeguard]]\nDuring the 1970s, school buses would undergo a number of design upgrades related to safety.  While many changes were related to protecting passengers, others were intended to minimizing the chances of [[traffic collision]]s.  To decrease confusion over traffic priority (increasing safety around school bus stops), federal and state regulations were amended, requiring for many states/provinces to add amber warning lamps inboard of the red warning lamps.  Similar to a yellow traffic light, the amber lights are activated before stopping (at {{Convert|100-300|ft|m|1|abbr=}} distance), indicating to drivers that a school bus is about to stop and unload/load students.  Adopted by a number of states during the mid-1970s, amber warning lights became nearly universal equipment on new school buses by the end of the 1980s.  To supplement the additional warning lights and to help prevent drivers from passing a stopped school bus, a stop arm was added to nearly all school buses; connected to the wiring of the warning lights, the deployable stop arm extended during a bus stop with its own set of red flashing lights.\n\nIn the 1970s, school busing expanded further, under controversial reasons; a number of larger cities began to [[desegregation busing|bus students in an effort to racially integrate schools]].  Out of necessity, the additional usage created further demand for bus production.\n\n==== Industry safety regulations ====\nFrom 1939 to 1973, school bus production was largely self-regulated.  In 1973, the first federal regulations governing school buses went into effect, as FMVSS 217 was required for school buses; the regulation governed specifications of rear emergency exit doors/windows.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />  Following the focus on school bus structural integrity, NHTSA introduced the four ''Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for School Buses,'' applied on April 1, 1977, bringing significant change to the design, engineering, and construction of school buses and a substantial improvement in safety performance.\n\nWhile many changes related to the 1977 safety standards were made under the body structure (to improve [[crashworthiness]]), the most visible change was to passenger seating.  In place of the metal-back passenger seats seen since the 1930s, the regulations introduced taller seats with thick padding on both the front and back, acting as a protective barrier.  Further improvement has resulted from continuing efforts by the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) and [[Transport Canada]], as well as by the bus industry and various safety advocates.  As of 2020 production, all of these standards remain in effect.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stnonline.com/resources/government/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards|title=Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards|work=School Transportation News|date=August 8, 2009|accessdate=2011-06-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927132934/http://www.stnonline.com/resources/government/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards|archivedate=September 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs manufacturers sought to develop safer school buses, small school buses underwent a transition away from automotive-based vehicles. The introduction of [[cutaway van chassis]] allowed bus manufacturers to mate a van cab with a purpose-built bus body, using the same construction as a full-size school bus.  Within the same length as a passenger van, buses such as the [[Wayne Busette]] and [[Blue Bird Micro Bird]] offered additional seating capacity, wheelchair lifts, and the same body construction as larger school buses.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |1973-1977 NHTSA regulations for school buses<ref name=\":6\" />\n|-\n!

As the decade began, the end of the baby-boom generation had finished high school; with a decrease in student population growth, school bus manufacturing was left with a degree of overcapacity.  Coupled with the recession economy of the early 1980s, the decline in demand for school bus production left several manufacturers in financial ruin. To better secure their future, during the 1990s, school bus manufacturers underwent a period of transition, with several ownership changes leading to joint ventures and alignments between body manufacturers and chassis suppliers.\n\nIn 1986, with the signing of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act, school bus drivers across the United States became required to acquire a [[Commercial driver's license|commercial driver's license (CDL)]].  While CDLs were issued by individual states, the federal CDL requirement ensured that drivers of all large vehicles (such as school buses) had a consistent training level.<ref name=\"STN Timeline\"/>\n\nIn contrast to the 1970s focus on structural integrity, design advances during the 1980s and 1990s focused around the driver.  In 1979 and 1980, International Harvester and Ford each introduced a new-generation bus chassis, with General Motors following suit in 1984.  To increase driver visibility, updates in line with chassis redesigns shifted the bus driver upward, outward, and forward.  To decrease driver distraction, interior controls were redesigned with improved [[ergonomics]]; automatic transmissions came into wider use, preventing the risk of stalling (in hazardous places such as intersections or railroad crossings).  Initially introduced during the late 1960s, crossview mirrors came into universal use, improving the view of the blind spots in front of the bus while loading or unloading.  To supplement the rear emergency door in an evacuation, manufacturers introduced additional emergency exits during the 1980s, including roof-mounted escape hatches and outward-opening exit windows.  Side-mounted exit doors (originally introduced on rear-engine buses), became offered on front-engine and conventional-body buses as a supplemental exit.\n\nAlongside safety, body and chassis manufacturers sought to advance fuel economy of school buses.  During the 1980s, diesel engines came into wide use in conventional and small school buses, gradually replacing gasoline-fueled engines.  In 1987, International became the first chassis manufacturer to offer diesel engines exclusively, with Ford following suit in 1990.\n\nWhile conventional-style buses remained the most widely produced full-size school bus, interest in forward visibility, higher seating capacity, and shorter turning radius led to a major expansion of market share of the transit-style configuration, coinciding with several design introductions in the late 1980s.  Following the 1986 introduction of the [[Wayne Lifestar]], the AmTran Genesis, [[Blue Bird TC/2000]], and [[Thomas Saf-T-Liner|Thomas Saf-T-Liner MVP]] would prove far more successful.\n\nDuring the 1990s, small school buses shifted further away from their van-conversion roots.  In 1991, [[Girardin Minibus|Girardin]] launched the MB-II, combining a single rear-wheel van chassis with a full cutaway bus body.  Following the 1992 redesign of the Ford E-Series and the 1997 launch of Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana cutaway chassis, manufacturers followed suit, developing bodies to optimize loading-zone visibility.  As manufacturers universally adopted cutaway bodies for single rear-wheel buses, the use of the [[Dodge Ram van|Dodge Ram Van]] chassis was phased out. By the late 1990s,{{When|date=February 2019}} the United States government banned the use of 15-passenger vans for student transport, leading to the introduction of Multi-Function School Activity Buses (MFSAB). To better protect passengers, MFSABs share the body structure and compartmentalized seating layout of school buses. Not intended (nor allowed) for uses requiring traffic priority, they are not fitted with school bus warning lights or stop arms (nor are they painted school bus yellow).\n\n==== Manufacturer transitions ====\nIn 1980, school buses were manufactured by six body manufacturers (Blue Bird, Carpenter, Superior, Thomas, Ward, Wayne) and three chassis manufacturers (Ford, General Motors, and International Harvester); in California, two manufacturers (Crown and Gillig) manufactured transit-style school buses using proprietary chassis (sold primarily across the West Coast).  From 1980 to 2001, all eight bus manufacturers would undergo periods of struggle and ownership changes.  In 1980, Ward filed for bankruptcy, reorganizing as [[AmTran]] in 1981.  The same year, Superior was liquidated by its parent company, closing its doors. Under its company management, Superior was split into two manufacturers, with [[Mid Bus]] introducing small buses in 1981 and a reorganized Superior producing full-size buses from 1982 to 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105135421/http://www.schoolbuscentral.com/gallery/updates/dec05/sup/1_82ford_lit.htm|title=School Bus Central {{!}} 1982 Superior Ford|date=2011-01-05|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref> At the end of 1989, Carpenter would file for bankruptcy, emerging from it in 1990.  In 1991, Crown Coach would close its doors forever; Gillig produced its last school bus in 1993.  Following several ownership changes, Wayne Corporation was liquidated in 1992; successor [[Wayne Wheeled Vehicles]] was closed in 1995. In 2001, Carpenter closed its doors.\n\nDuring the 1990s, as body manufacturers secured their future, family-owned businesses were replaced by subsidiaries as manufacturers underwent mergers, joint ventures, and acquisitions with major chassis suppliers.  In 1991, Navistar began its acquisition of AmTran (fully acquiring it in 1995), phasing out the Ward brand name in 1993.  In 1992, Blue Bird would change hands for the first of several times.  In 1998, Carpenter was acquired by Spartan Motors and Thomas Built Buses was sold to Freightliner; the latter was the final major school bus manufacturer operating under family control.\n\nAlongside the 1981 introduction of Mid Bus, [[Corbeil Bus Corporation|Corbeil]] commenced production in Canada and the United States in 1985.  Following the second (and final) closure of Superior in 1986, New Bus Company acquired the rights to its body design, producing buses from 1988 to 1989.  In 1991, TAM-USA was a joint venture to produce the [[Tovarna avtomobilov Maribor|TAM]] 252 A 121. Assembled in Slovenia with final assembly in California, the TAM vehicle was to be the first American-market school bus imported from Europe.\n\nIn comparison to body manufacturers, chassis suppliers saw a smaller degree of transition.  As International Harvester became [[Navistar International]] in 1986, the company released updated bus chassis for 1989; in 1996, it produced its first rear-engine bus chassis since 1973.  In late 1996, Freightliner produced its first bus chassis, expanding to four manufacturers for the first time since the exit of Dodge in 1977.  Ford and General Motors gradually exited out of cowled-chassis production with Ford producing its last chassis after 1998; General Motors exited the segment after 2003.  Both Ford and GM continue production today, concentrating on cutaway-van chassis.\n\n=== 2000\u2013present ===\n[[File:Blue Bird Vision Montevideo 54.jpg|thumb|Blue Bird Vision (2008-2010)]]\n[[File:2010 Thomas Saf-T-Liner C2.jpg|thumb|Thomas Saf-T-Liner C2]]\nThe beginning of the 21st century would introduce extensive changes to the production of school buses.  Though vehicle assembly saw few direct changes, manufacturer consolidation and industry contraction effectively ended the practice of customers selecting body and chassis manufacturers independently.  While the aspect of customer choice was largely ended (as a result of corporate ownership and supply agreements), decreased complexity paved the way for new product innovations previously thought impossible.   During the 2010s, while diesel engines have remained the primary source of power, manufacturers expanded the availability of alternative-fuel vehicles, including CNG, propane, gasoline, and electric-power buses.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2000s, manufacturers introduced a new generation of conventional-style school buses, coinciding with the redesign of several medium-duty truck lines.  While Ford and General Motors shifted bus production to cutaway chassis, Freightliner and International released new cowled chassis in 2004 and 2005, respectively.  In 2003, Blue Bird introduced the [[Blue Bird Vision|Vision]] conventional; in line with its transit-style buses, the Vision utilized a proprietary chassis (rather than a design from a medium-duty truck).  In 2004, Thomas introduced the [[Thomas Saf-T-Liner C2|Saf-T-Liner C2]] (derived from the [[Freightliner Business Class M2|Freightliner M2]]), with the body designed alongside its chassis (allowing the use of the production Freightliner dashboard).  A trait of both the Vision and C2 (over their predecessors) is improved loading-zone visibility; both vehicles adopted highly sloped hoods and extra glass around the entry door.  In 2005, IC introduced a redesigned CE-series to fit the [[International 3300]] chassis; to improve visibility, the windshield was redesigned (eliminating the center post).      \n\nBetween 2004 and 2008<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0402/p01s03-ussc.html|title=It's a plug-in hybrid \u2013 and it's a school bus|date=2007-04-02|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2019-10-03|issn=0882-7729}}</ref>, [https://www.advancedenergy.org/ Advanced Energy], an NC based non-profit created by the NC Utilities Commission begun an effort to move to plug-in [[Hybrid electric bus|hybrid school buses]].

Along with a 102-inch body width, to resist corrosion, Lion uses composite body panels in place of steel.  In 2015, Lion introduced the eLion, the first mass-produced school bus with a fully electric powertrain.  \n\nSmall school buses have undergone few fundamental changes to their designs during the 2000s, though the Type B configuration has largely been retired from production.  Following the 1998 sale of the General Motors P-chassis to Navistar subsidiary [[Workhorse Group|Workhorse]], the design began to be phased out in favor of higher-capacity Type A buses.  In 2006, IC introduced the BE200 as its first small school bus; a fully cowled Type B, the BE200 shared much of its body with the CE (on a lower-profile chassis).  In 2010, IC introduced the AE-series, a cutaway-cab school bus (derived from the [[International TerraStar]]).  In 2015, the [[Ford Transit]] cutaway chassis was introduced (alongside the long-running E350/450); initially sold with a Micro Bird body, the Transit has been offered through several manufacturers.  In 2018, the first bus derived from the [[Ram ProMaster]] cutaway chassis was introduced; Collins Bus introduced the Collins Low Floor, the first low-floor school bus (of any configuration).\n\n==== Manufacturing segment stability      ====\nFollowing the 2001 closure of Carpenter, the manufacturing segment has seen a much lower degree of contraction (with the exception of the 2005 failure of startup manufacturer [[Liberty Bus]]).  Following the bankruptcy of Corbeil, the company was acquired at the end of 2007 by Collins, reorganizing it as a subsidiary (alongside Mid Bus) and shifting production to its Kansas facilities.  The same year, U.S. Bus was reorganized as [[Trans Tech]].  In 2008, Starcraft Bus entered the segment, producing school buses on cutaway chassis (a 2011 prototype using a Hino chassis was never produced).  In 2009, Blue Bird and Girardin entered into a joint venture, named Micro Bird; Girardin develops and produces the Blue Bird small-bus product line in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolbusfleet.com/Channel/Management-Training/Articles/2010/02/Q-A-Blue-Bird-Girardin-Join-Forces.aspx|title=Blue Bird, Girardin Join Forces|date=February 19, 2010|work=School Bus Fleet Magazine|accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref>  The 2011 founding of Lion Bus marked the return of bus production to Canada (with the first Canadian-brand full-size buses sold in the United States).  During the 2010s, Collins retired the Mid Bus and Corbeil brands (in 2013 and 2016, respectively).\n\n==== Safety innovations ====\nDuring the 2000s, school bus safety adopted a number of evolutionary advances.  To further improve visibility for other drivers, manufacturers began to replace incandescent lights with [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]<nowiki/>s for running lights, turn signals, brake lights, and warning lamps.  [[School bus crossing arm]]s, first introduced in the late 1990s, came into wider use.  Electronics took on a new role in school bus operation. To increase child safety and security, alarm systems have been developed to prevent children from being left on unattended school buses overnight.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQs/Q: The school bus looks like it's hardly changed in decades.

When making student dropoffs or pickups, traffic law gives school buses priority over other vehicles; in order to stop traffic, they are equipped with flashing lights and a stop sign.\n\nAs a consequence of their size, school buses have a number of blind spots around the outside of the vehicle which can endanger passengers disembarking a bus or pedestrians standing or walking nearby.  To address this safety challenge, a key point of school bus design is focused on exterior visibility, improving the design of bus windows, mirrors, and the windshield to optimize visibility for the driver.  In the case of a collision, the body structure of a school bus is designed with an integral [[roll cage]]; as a school bus carries a large number of student passengers, a school bus is designed with several emergency exits to facilitate fast egress.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, numerous federal and state regulations require school buses to be manufactured as a purpose-built vehicle distinct from other buses.  In contrast to buses in use for public transit, dedicated school buses used for student transport are all [[Single-deck bus|single-deck]], two-axle design ([[Multi-axle bus|multi-axle designs]] are no longer in use).  Outside of North America, buses utilized for student transport are derived from vehicles used elsewhere in transit systems, including coaches, minibuses, and transit buses.\n\n=== Types ===\n[[File:Figure 1- Types of School Buses (32614876865) (3).jpg|thumb|School bus types<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/scschoolfiles/704/fmvss__school_buses.pdf|title=Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stnonline.com/federal-actions/item/1298-school-bus-types|title=School bus types|author=|date=15 October 2009|publisher=School Transportation News|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>|alt=|495x495px]]\nThere are four types of school buses produced by manufacturers in North America.<ref name=\":0\" />   The smallest school buses are designated Type A (based on cutaway van chassis); a larger format (bodied on bare front-engine chassis) are designated Type B buses.  Large school buses include Type C (bodied on cowled medium-duty truck chassis) and Type D (bodied on bare \"forward control\" or \"pusher\" chassis).  Type C buses are the most common design, while Type D buses are the largest vehicles.    \n\nAll school buses are of [[Single-deck bus|single deck]] design with step entry.

Along with their usage, these buses are distinguished from regular yellow school buses by their exterior design.  \n\nAn \"activity bus\" is a school bus used for providing transportation for students.  In place of home to school route service, an activity bus is primarily used for the purpose for transportation related to extracurricular activities.  Depending on individual state/provincial regulations, the bus used for this purpose can either be a regular yellow school bus or a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Dedicated activity buses, while not painted yellow, are fitted with the similar interiors as well as the same traffic control devices for dropping off students (at other schools); conversely, it cannot be used in regular route service.\n\nA Multi-Function School Activity Bus (MFSAB) is a bus intended for use in both the private sector and the educational system.  While sharing a body structure with a school bus, an MFSAB is not designed for use in route service, as it is not fitted with traffic control devices (i.e., red warning lights, stop arm) nor is it painted school bus yellow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stnonline.com/faqs|title=Why do some school buses look different than others, for example in color?|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101104441/http://www.stnonline.com/faqs|archivedate=2010-01-01|accessdate=2010-05-23}}</ref>  Within the educational system, the design is primarily used for extracurricular activities requiring bus transportation; in the private sector, the MFSAB is intended as an replacement for 15-passenger vans (no longer legal for child transport in either the public or private sector).<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stnonline.com/faqs|title=Are there other vehicles that can be used for school transportation?

In addition to \"School Bus\" signage in the front and rear above the window line, school buses are labeled with the name of the operator (school district or bus contractor) and an identification number.\n\n===== Yellow color =====\n{{Main|school bus yellow}}\nYellow was adopted as the standard color for North American school buses in 1939.  In April of that year, rural education specialist [[Frank W. Cyr]] organized a national conference at [[Columbia University]] to establish production standards for school buses, including a standard exterior color.  The color which became known as \"school bus yellow\" was selected because black lettering on that specific hue was [[Rule of tincture|easiest to see]] in the semi-darkness of early morning and late afternoon.  Officially, school bus yellow was designated \"National School Bus Chrome\"; following the removal of lead from the pigment, it was renamed \"[[school bus yellow|National School Bus Glossy Yellow]]\".\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the association of yellow with school buses has led to its use on school-use buses around the world (although not necessarily required by government specification).  Some areas establishing school transport services have conducted evaluations of American yellow-style school buses;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/784567.stm|title=UK may get yellow school buses|author=Rob Watson|date=June 13, 2000|access-date=April 7, 2010|work=BBC News}}</ref> to better suit local climate conditions, other governments have established their own color requirements, favoring other high-visibility colors (such as white or orange<ref name=\"WA School Bus Specifications including detail on required White Green and Orange Paint Scheme\" /><ref name=\"pro-forma bus supply contract\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/b2b/bus/schedule_8_-_contract_buses_and_contract_depots.pdf|title=Sydney Metropolitan Bus Service Contract-Schedule 8|access-date=October 20, 2013}}</ref>).  [[File:School Bus Yard Reflection.jpg|thumb|Reflective tape on school buses (brightened by camera flash)]]\n\n===== Retroreflective markings =====\nWhile its yellow exterior makes it more conspicuous than other vehicles, a school bus can remain hard to see in some low-visibility conditions, including sunrise or sunset, poor weather (all seasons), and in rural areas.

Marking the length, width, height, and in some cases, identifying the bus as a school bus, reflective tape makes the vehicle easier to see in low light, also marking all emergency exits (so rescue personnel can quickly find them in darkness).<ref>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/get-cfr.cgi?TITLE=49&PART=571&SECTION=217&TYPE=TEXT Bus emergency exits and window retention and release] Code of Federal Regulations Title 49, Section 571.217. Retrieved 2010-04-15</ref>  Other requirements include reflective \"School Bus\" lettering (or the use of a front-lighted sign). \n\nThe equivalent requirement in Canada is almost identical; the only difference is that red cannot be used as a retroreflective color.\n\n==== Safety devices ====\nTo comply with federal and state requirements, school buses are equipped with a number of safety devices to prevent accidents and injuries and for the purposes of security.\n\n===== Mirror systems =====\n[[File:Inside View of School Bus.jpg|thumb|View behind school bus driver's compartment, showing multiple mirrors (rearview, convex, and crossview) and sun visor|alt=]]\n[[File:School Bus Xview.jpg|thumb|Vision field of a school bus crossview mirror, which allows bus driver to observe blind spots close to vehicle.  |alt=]]\n\nWhen driving and when loading/unloading students, a key priority for a school bus driver is maintaining proper sightlines around their vehicle; the blind spots formed by the school bus can be a significant risk to bus drivers and traffic as well as pedestrians. \n\nIn the United States, approximately <big>\u2154</big> of students killed outside of the school bus are not struck by other vehicles, but by their own bus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autos.groups.yahoo.com/group/WayneBusEnthusiasts/files/|title=Protecting Children from Their Own Buses by Mark D. Fisher|accessdate=January 29, 2006}}</ref>  To combat this problem, school buses are specified with sophisticated and comprehensive mirror systems.  In redesigns of school bus bodies, driver visibility and overall sightlines have become important considerations.  In comparison to school buses from the 1980s, school buses from the 2000s have much larger windscreens and fewer and/or smaller blind spots.\n\n=====Emergency exits=====\n[[File:05schoolbusachter.jpg|thumb|Typical school bus rear emergency exit door]]\nFor the purposes of evacuation, school buses are equipped with a minimum of at least one emergency exit (in addition to the main entry door).  The rear-mounted emergency exit door is a design feature adopted from horse-drawn wagons (the entrance was rear-mounted to avoid disturbing the horses); in rear-engine school buses, the door is replaced by an exit window mounted above the engine compartment (supplemented by a side-mounted exit door).  Additional exits may be located in the roof (roof hatches), window exits, and/or side emergency exit doors. All are opened by the use of quick-release latches which activate an alarm.\n\nThe number of emergency exits in a school bus is dependent on its seating capacity and also varies by individual state/provincial requirements.  The most currently installed is eight; Kentucky requires a rear exit door (or window, for rear-engine buses), a left-side exit door, four exit windows, and two roof-mounted exit hatches.\n\n=====Video surveillance=====\nSince the 1990s, video cameras have become common equipment installed inside school buses.  As recording technology has transitioned from [[VHS]] to [[Digital camera|digital cameras]], school buses have adopted multiple-camera systems, providing surveillance from multiple vantage points. \n\nWhile primarily used to monitor and record passenger behavior, video cameras have also been used in the investigation of accidents involving school buses.  On March 28, 2000, a [[Murray County, Georgia]], school bus was hit by a [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] freight train at an unsignaled [[level crossing|railroad crossing]]; three children were killed.  The bus driver claimed to have stopped and looked for approaching trains before proceeding across the tracks, as is required by law, but the onboard camera recorded that the bus had in fact not stopped.<ref>[https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/HAR0103.aspx Highway Accident Report \u2013 NTSB/HAR-01/03] National Transportation Safety Board (December 11, 2001).

The cameras photograph vehicles that illegally pass the bus when its stop arm and warning lights are in use (thus committing a moving violation).\n\n====Restraint systems====\nIn contrast to cars and other light-duty passenger vehicles, school buses are not typically equipped with active restraint systems, such as [[seat belt]]s; whether seat belts should be a requirement has been a topic of controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stnonline.com/resources/seat-belts/related-seat-belt-articles/264-napt-advocates-scientific-approach-to-seat-belt-issue|title=NAPT Advocates Scientific Approach to Seat Belt Issue|author=Janna Morrison|date=August 8, 2008|publisher=School Transportation News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716144919/http://www.stnonline.com/resources/seat-belts/related-seat-belt-articles/264-napt-advocates-scientific-approach-to-seat-belt-issue|archive-date=2011-07-16|url-status=|accessdate=2010-04-16}}</ref>  Since the 1970s, school buses have used the concept of [[compartmentalization (engineering)|compartmentalization]] as a passive restraint system<ref name=\"Compartmentalization\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.stnonline.com/resources/seat-belts/compartmentalization|title=Compartmentalization|date=2012-02-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202044820/http://www.stnonline.com/resources/seat-belts/compartmentalization|archivedate=2012-02-02|url-status=bot: unknown|access-date=2016-09-05}}</ref>; during the late 2000s and 2010s, seatbelt design transitioned, with 3-point restraints replacing lap belts.  \n\nAs of 2015, seatbelts are a requirement in at least five states:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehour.com/story/482394|title=Connecticut considers installing seat belts on school buses|author=Susan Haigh|date=February 17, 2010|publisher=The Hour Online|accessdate=2010-04-16}}</ref> [[California]], [[Florida]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Texas]]; Canada does not require their installation (at the provincial level).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010055207/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/roadsafety/tp-tp13330-bussch_e-245.htm#belts|title=Review of Bus Safety Issues - School Bus Passenger Protection - Review of Bus Safety Issues - Abstract & Index - Road & Motor Vehicle Safety Publications - Road and Motor Vehicle Safety - Road Transportation - Transport Canada|date=2009-10-10|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref>  Of the states that equip buses with two-point lap seat belts (Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey and New York), only New Jersey requires seat belt usage by riders.<ref>[http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/roadsafety/tp-tp13330-bussch_e-245.htm#belts Seat Belts in School Buses] Transport Canada. Retrieved 2010-04-19</ref> In other states, it is up to the district or operator whether to require riders to use them or not.\n\n===== Passive restraints (compartmentalization) =====\nAccording to the National Highway Transportation Association (NHTSA), studies completed previously on school buses showed that due to their size and heaviness, school buses did not require that safety belts be in place. Information gathered in previous studies showed that a size of a bus, combined with the design of the seat and the material the in the space between the seats themselves, showed that there was no need of safety belts on a school bus.  A bus is larger and heavier than a normal size passenger vehicle and could distribute the force of the crash evenly. Combined with the space between the seats as well as the design prevented serious injuries from happening.  This attribute, does not carry over to a small bus due to its lesser size; buses with a GVWR under 10,000 pounds are required to have safety belts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/road-safety/school-bus-safety|title=School Bus Safety|last=amy.lee.ctr@dot.gov|date=2016-09-09|website=NHTSA|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref>  \n\nHowever, recent accidents involving school buses that have caused serious (if not fatal) injuries have caused the National Transportation Safety Board to conduct new tests to check the legitimacy of this continued practice. After completing these tests due to bus accidents in 2016, they have recommended that new buses being built need to have both a lap and shoulder harness in place.

This had become \"the most widely cited study\" in North America, according to U.S. regulators, and was frequently quoted for decades by school boards and bus manufacturers across the continent as a reason not to install seat belts. Transport Canada has stuck to its stance against installing seat belts on school buses, despite numerous newer studies and actual accidents showing that compartmentalization could not protect against side impacts, rollovers, and being rear-ended; which would have been avoided by implementing [[Seat belt#Three-point|three-point seat belts]] that would have kept occupants from being thrown from their seats.<ref>https://www.cbc.ca/fifth/episodes/2018-2019/unbuckled-school-bus-safety</ref><ref>https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/school-bus-seatbelts-1.4826500</ref>\n\n== School bus manufacture ==\nIn most cases, school buses are assembled by [[second stage manufacturer]]s, mating a bus body with a second-party chassis.  Some school buses (typically those of Type D configuration) are produced with both body and chassis from the same manufacturer.\n\nIn 2018, 44,381 school buses were sold in North America (compared to 31,194 in 2010).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://files.schoolbusfleet.com/stats/SBFFB19-sales.pdf|website=files.schoolbusfleet.com|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref>  Approximately 70% of production is of Type C configuration.\n\n===Production (North America)===\n{{mainlist|List of school bus manufacturers}}\nIn the United States and Canada, school buses are currently produced by nine different manufacturers.  Four of them\u2014[[Collins Industries]], [[Starcraft Bus]], [[Trans Tech]], and [[Van Con]] \u2014 specialize exclusively in small buses.  [[Thomas Built Buses]] and [[Blue Bird Corporation]] (the latter, through its Micro Bird joint venture with [[Girardin Minibus|Girardin]])\u2014produce both small and large buses.  IC Bus and Lion Electric produce full-size buses exclusively.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Canada was home to satellite facilities of several U.S. firms (Blue Bird, Thomas, Wayne), exporting production across North America, with other production imported from the United States.  Domestically, [[Corbeil Buses|Corbeil]] manufactured full-size and small school buses (1985-2007) and Girardin produced small buses.  In 2011, Lion Bus (today, Lion Electric Company/ La Compagnie \u00c9lectrique Lion) was founded as a Quebec-based manufacturer of full-size buses, shifting development to fully-electric vehicles.  \n\n== Operations ==\nEvery year in the United States and Canada, school buses provide an estimated 8 billion student trips from home and school.  Each school day in 2015, nearly 484,000 school buses transported 26.9 million children to and from school and school-related activities; over half of the United States K\u201312 student population is transported by school bus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digital.schoolbusfleet.com/2016FB/Default/16/1/2918502#&pageSet=19|title=School Bus Fleet, Factbook 2016|website=digital.schoolbusfleet.com|access-date=2016-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanschoolbuscouncil.org/index.php?page=faq#a_5|title=FAQs|publisher=American School Bus Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225071413/http://www.americanschoolbuscouncil.org/index.php?page=faq#a_5|archivedate=2010-12-25|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372|title=National Center for Education Statistics{{!}}Fast Facts|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref>  Outside North America, purpose-built vehicles for student transport are less common.  Depending on location, students ride to school on transit buses (on school-only routes), [[Coach (bus)|coaches]], or a variety of other buses.\n\nWhile school bus operations vary widely by location, in the United States and Canada, school bus services operate independent of [[Public transport bus service|public transport]], with their own [[bus stop]]s and schedules, coordinated with school class times.\n\n=== Licensing ===\nSchool bus drivers in the United States are required to hold a [[commercial driver's license]] (CDL).  Full-size school buses are generally considered Class B vehicles; most van-based school buses are considered Class C vehicles.  In addition to a standard P (passenger) endorsement, school bus drivers must acquire a separate S (school bus) endorsement; along with a written and driving test, the endorsement requires a [[Background check#United States|background check]] and [[Sex offender registries in the United States|sex offender registry check]].\n\n===Loading and unloading===\n[[File:Children about to board the school bus (Thibodaux, Louisiana).jpg|alt=|thumb|School bus at bus stop with 8-way warning lights, dual stop arms, and [[School bus crossing arm|crossing arm]] ]]\nCoinciding with their seating configuration, school buses have a higher seating capacity than buses of a similar length; a typical full-size school bus can carry from 66 to 90 passengers.  In contrast to a transit bus, school buses are equipped with a single entry door at the front of the bus.  Several configurations of entry doors are used on school buses, including center-hinged (jack-knife) and outward-opening.  Prior to the 2000s, doors operated manually by the driver were the most common, with air or electric-assist becoming nearly universal in current vehicles.\n\nSchool bus routes are designed with multiple bus stops, allowing for the loading (unloading) of several students at a time; the stop at school is the only time that the bus loads (unloads) passengers at once.\n\nTo inhibit pedestrians from walking into the blind spot created by the hood (or lower bodywork, on Type D buses), [[school bus crossing arm|crossing arms]] are safety devices that extend outward from the front bumper when the bus is stopped for loading or unloading.<ref>[http://www.schoolbusfleet.com/Channel/School-Bus-Safety/Articles/2007/09/Improving-Safety-in-the-Danger-Zone.aspxImproving Safety in the Danger Zone] School Bus Fleet (September 1, 2007). Retrieved 2010-04-19</ref>  By design, these force passengers to walk forward several feet forward of the bus (into the view of the driver) before they can cross the road in front of the bus.\n\nIn the past, handrails in the entry way posed a potential risk for to students; as passengers exited a bus, items such as [[drawstring]]s or other loose clothing could be caught if the driver was unaware and pulled away with the student caught in the door. To minimize this risk, school bus manufacturers have redesigned handrails and equipment in the stepwell area.  In its ''School Bus Handrail Handbook'', the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] described a simple test procedure for identifying unsafe stepwell handrails.<ref>[http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/buses/handrail/handrail.html#Mechanics Handrail Mechanics] ''School Bus Handrail Handbook''. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Retrieved 2010-04-19.</ref>\n\n===Traffic priority===\n{{See also|School bus traffic stop laws}}\nIn contrast to transit and intercity buses, when loading and unloading students, school buses have the ability to stop traffic, using a system of warning lights and stop arms-a stop sign that is deployed from the bus to stop traffic.\n\nBy the mid-1940s, most U.S. states introduced traffic laws requiring motorists to stop for school buses while children were loading or unloading.{{citation needed|date=July 2007}} The justifications for this protocol were:\n\n* Children (especially younger ones) have normally not yet developed the mental capacity to fully comprehend the hazards and consequences of street-crossing, and under U.S. tort laws, a child cannot legally be held accountable for negligence. For the same reason, adult [[crossing guard]]s often are deployed in walking zones between homes and schools.\n* It is impractical in many cases to avoid children crossing the traveled portions of roadways after leaving a school bus or to have an adult accompany them.\n* The size of a school bus generally limits visibility for both the children and motorists during loading and unloading.\n\nSince at least the mid-1970s, all U.S. states and Canadian provinces and territories have some sort of school bus traffic stop law; although each jurisdiction requires traffic to stop for a school bus loading and unloading passengers, different jurisdictions have different requirements of when to stop. Outside of North America, the school bus stopping traffic to unload and load children is not provided for. Instead of being given traffic priority, fellow drivers are encouraged to drive with extra caution around school buses.\n\n====Warning lights and stop arms====\n[[File:Maine School bus stop.jpg|thumb|School bus with red warning lights and deployed stop arm]]\nAround 1946, the first system of traffic warning signal lights on school buses was used in [[Virginia]], consisting of a pair of sealed beam lights.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  Instead of colorless glass lenses (similar to car headlamps), the warning lamps utilized red lenses.  A motorized rotary switch applied power alternately to the red lights mounted at the left and right of the front and rear of the bus, creating a [[wig-wag (automobile)|wig-wag effect]].  Activation was typically through a mechanical switch attached to the door control. However, on some buses (such as Gillig's Transit Coach models and the Kenworth-Pacific School Coach) activation of the roof warning lamp system was through the use of a pressure-sensitive switch on a manually controlled stop paddle lever located to the left of the driver's seat below the window. Whenever the pressure was relieved by extending the stop paddle, the electric current was activated to the relay.  In the 1950s, plastic lenses were developed for the warning lenses, though the warning lights (with colorless glass lenses) used sealed-beam lamps into the mid-2000s, when light-emitting diodes [[Automotive lighting#Light emitting diodes (LED)|(LEDs)]] came into use.\n\nThe warning lamps initially used for school buses consisted of four red warning lights.  With the adoption of [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108|FMVSS 108]] in January 1968, four additional warning lights were gradually added to school buses; these were amber in color and mounted inboard of the red warning lights.<ref name=\"FMVSS 108\">{{cite journal|title=Code of Federal Regulations Title 49, Volume 6, Section 571.108|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title49-vol6/pdf/CFR-2011-title49-vol6-sec571-108.pdf|pages=361}}</ref> Intended to signal an upcoming stop to drivers, as the entry door was opened at the stop, they were wired to be overridden by the red lights and the stop sign.<ref name=\"FMVSS 108\" /> Although 8-light systems were adopted by many states and provinces during the 1970s and 1980s, the all-red systems remain in use by some locales such as [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Ontario, Canada]], older buses from [[California]], as well as on buses built in [[Wisconsin]] before 2005.<ref>[https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/347/II/25/2 Wisconsin Legislature 347.25 (2)] Wisconsin Statutues  Chapter 347 (EQUIPMENT OF VEHICLES) Retrieved 2016-09-18</ref>\n\nTo aid visibility of the bus in inclement weather, school districts and school bus operators add flashing [[strobe light]]s to the roof of the bus. Some states (for example, Illinois)<ref>[http://www.ilga.gov/commission/jcar/admincode/092/092004420D06150R.html Illinois school bus safety standards: Lamps, Reflectors, Signals] Illinois Administrative Code Title 92 (Transportation), Sec. 442.615g. Retrieved 2010-04-16</ref> require strobe lights as part of their local specifications.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, states began to specify a mechanical stop signal arm which the driver would deploy from the left side of the bus to warn traffic of a stop in progress. The portion of the stop arm protruding in front of traffic was initially a trapezoidal shape with {{smallcaps|stop}} painted on it. The U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]'s [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards|Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard]] No. 131 regulates the specifications of the stop arm as a double-faced regulation octagonal red [[stop sign]] at least {{convert|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} across, with white border and uppercase legend. It must be [[Retroreflection|retroreflective]] and/or equipped with alternately flashing red lights.

Along with newly produced vehicles, conversions of retired school buses see a large range of uses.  Qualities desired from school buses involve sturdy construction (as school buses have an all-steel body and frame), a large seating capacity, and wheelchair lift capability, among others.\n\n=== School bus derivatives ===\n\n==== Church use ====\n[[File:Church bus Highland Heights United Methodist Church Memphis TN 06.jpg|alt=|thumb|Church bus in Memphis, Tennessee]]\nChurches throughout the United States and Canada use buses to transport their congregants, both to church services and events.  A wide variety of buses are owned by churches, depending on needs and affordability.  Larger buses may often be derived from school buses (newly purchased or second-hand).  Other churches often own [[minibus]]es, often equipped with wheelchair lifts.  When school bus derivatives are used, church bus livery is dictated by federal regulations, which require the removal of \"School Bus\" lettering and the disabling/removal of stop arms/warning lights.<ref name=\"Safety Guidelines\" />  In some states, School Bus Yellow must be painted over entirely.  \n\nIn church use, transporting adults and/or children, traffic law does not give church buses traffic priority in most states ([[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Virginia]] being the only states where a church bus can stop traffic with flashing red lights<ref>{{cite web|url=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-917.1/|title=LIS \u00a7 46.2\u2013917.1. School buses hired to transport children.|work=Code of Virginia|accessdate=December 4, 2005}}</ref>).\n\n====Community outreach====\nIn terms of vehicles used for [[Outreach|community outreach]], school bus bodyshells (both new and second-hand) see use as [[bookmobile]]s and [[bloodmobile|mobile blood donation centers (bloodmobiles)]], among other uses.   Both types of vehicles spend long periods of time parked in the same place; to reduce fuel consumption, they often power interior equipment and climate control with an on-board generator in place of the chassis engine.\n\nBookmobiles feature interior shelving for books and library equipment; bloodmobiles feature mobile phlebotomy stations and blood storage. \n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Blood Drive Bus 2008 March MA.JPG|Massachusetts bloodmobile \nFile:Blood Centers of the Pacific Blue Bird.JPG|Redwood City, California bloodmobile\nFile:Big Red Bus, Tifton.JPG|Tifton County, Georgia bloodmobile \nFile:The Choice Bus.jpg|\"Choice Bus\", a former school bus (Blue Bird TC/2000) configured with half mobile classroom (school bus)/half prison bus interior, developed in an effort to prevent student dropouts in the United States. \nFile:Seattle - Fiestas Patrias Parade 2008 - bookmobile.jpg|Seattle Public Library bookmobile (1980s Thomas/Chevrolet)\nFile:Bookmobile.jpg|Ottawa (ON) Public Library bookmobile (Thomas HDX)\nFile:Queens PL bookmobile on Center Boulevard jeh.JPG|Queens (NYC) Public Library bookmobile (Blue Bird TC/2000)\nFile:Ypsilanti District Library Bookmobile.JPG|Ypsilanti District Library bookmobile (Blue Bird TC/1000, rebodied)\n</gallery>\n\n====Law enforcement====\n{{main|police bus}}\nLarger police agencies may own [[police bus]]es derived from school bus bodies for a number of purposes.  Along with buses with high-capacity seating serving as officer transports (in large-scale deployments), other vehicles derived from buses may have little seating, serving as temporary mobile command centers; these vehicles are built from school bus bodyshells and fitted with agency-specified equipment.\n\n[[Prisoner transport vehicle]]s are high-security vehicles used to transport prisoners; a school bus bodyshell is fitted with a specially designed interior and exterior with secure windows and doors.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Union Tpke 164th St td (2018-05-18) 01 - NYPD Medical Bus.jpg|NYPD Medical Operations bus (Thomas EFX)\nFile:NYCPD Command Post 4077.jpg|NYPD Command Post bus (Blue Bird A3RE)\nFile:St Johns County Sheriff Dept FL (5).jpg|St. John's County (FL) Command Center bus (1980s Blue Bird All American), curbside view\n</gallery>\n\n=== Uses of retired school buses ===\nAs of 2016, the average age of a school bus in the United States is 9.3 years.<ref name=\"SBF factbook\">{{cite web|url=http://digital.schoolbusfleet.com/2016FB/Default/16/1/2918502#&pageSet=23|title=School Bus Fleet Factbook 2016|pages=46\u201350|accessdate=26 January 2016}}</ref>  School buses can be retired from service due to a number of factors, including vehicle age or mileage, mechanical condition, emissions compliance, or any combination of these factors.<ref name=\"SBF factbook\" />  In some states and provinces, school bus retirement is called for at specific age or mileage intervals, regardless of mechanical condition.  In recent years, budget concerns in many publicly funded school districts have necessitated that school buses be kept in service longer.\n\nWhen a school bus is retired from school use, it can see a wide variety of usage.  While a majority are [[Vehicle recycling|scrapped]] for parts and recycling (a requirement in some states), better-running examples are put up for sale as surplus vehicles.  Second-hand school buses are sold to such entities as churches, resorts or [[summer camp]]s; others are exported to Central America, South America, or elsewhere.  Other examples of retired school buses are preserved and restored by collectors and [[bus enthusiast]]s; collectors and museums have an interest in older and rarer models.  Additionally, restored school buses appear alongside other period vehicles in television or film.\n\nWhen a school bus is sold for usage outside of student transport, [[NHTSA]] regulations require that its identification as a school bus be removed.<ref name=\"Safety Guidelines\" />  To do so, all school bus lettering must be removed or covered while the exterior must be painted a color different than school bus yellow; the stop arm(s) and warning lamps must be removed or disabled.<ref name=\"Safety Guidelines\" />\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:1942 Chevrolet bus Gillig body.jpg|1942 Gillig/Chevrolet in use as a tour bus\nFile:1946 Chevrolet School Bus \"SoKool Bus\".jpg|1946 Chevrolet school bus restored and customized\nFile:The Gator Bus.jpg|The \"Gator Bus\", a 1960s Wayne/Chevrolet school bus repurposed as a sign for an alligator park in Louisiana \nFile:Dubois County Bombers bus.JPG|1980s Crown Supercoach restored, painted to match the bus from ''[[A League of Their Own]]''\nFile:2018-08-19 Former Blue Bird TC2000 school bus at Jasper, AB 0698.jpg|Retired school bus (Blue Bird TC/2000) in use as a rafting shuttle\n</gallery><br />\n\n====School bus conversions====\nIn retirement, not all school buses live on as transport vehicles.  In contrast, the purchasers of school buses use the large body and chassis to use as either a working vehicle, or as a basis to build a rolling home.  To build a utility vehicle for farms, owners often remove much of the roof and sides, creating a large flatbed or open-bed truck for hauling hay.  Other farms use unconverted, re-painted, school buses to transport their [[workforce]].\n\n[[List of recreational vehicles#Bus conversion|Skoolies]] are retired school buses converted into [[recreational vehicle]]s (the term also applies to their owners and enthusiasts).  Constructed and customized by their owners; while some examples have primitive accommodations, others rival the features of production RVs.  Exteriors vary widely, including only the removal of school bus lettering, conservative designs, or the bus equivalent of an [[art car]].  An example of a Skoolie is [[Further (bus)|Further]], a 1939 (and later, 1947) school bus converted by [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]], intended for use on cross-country counterculture road trips.  Both versions of Further are painted with a variety of psychedelic colors and designs.  <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Burning Man 2013 Cargo Cult (3).jpg|1990s school bus conversion at 2013 [[Burning Man]]\nFile:Further-1.jpg|Further (1947 version)\nFile:Further-2.jpg|Further (1947 version), rear\nFile:Further-1-2.jpg|Both versions of Further (1939 at right)\n</gallery><br />\n\n===School bus export===\nRetired school buses from Canada and the United States are sometimes exported to Africa, Central America, South America, or elsewhere. Used as public transportation between communities, these buses are nicknamed \"[[chicken bus]]es\" for both their crowded accommodation and the (occasional) transportation of livestock alongside passengers.  To attract passengers (and fares), yellow buses are often repainted with flamboyant exterior color schemes and modified with chrome exterior trim.\n\n==Around the world==\n{{main|School bus by country}}Outside the United States and Canada, the usage and design of buses for student transport varies worldwide.  In Europe, Asia, and Australia, buses utilized for student transport may be derived from standard transit buses.  Alongside differences in body, chassis, and seating design, school buses outside North America differ primarily in their signage, livery, and traffic priority.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Buses}}\n* [[Desegregation busing in the United States]]\n* [[List of school bus manufacturers]]\n* [[Walking bus]]\n*[[Riding school bus]]\n{{clear right}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|School buses}}\n* [http://www.schoolbusfleet.com/ ''School Bus Fleet Magazine''] \u2013 news magazine for student transportation professionals\n* [http://www.stnonline.com/ ''School Transportation News''] \u2013 news magazine for student transportation professionals\n* [http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/import/FMVSS/ U.S. DOT, NHTSA, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for School Buses (FMVSS)]\n* [http://www.wisconsinlife.org/story/school-bus-driver-steers-students-toward-love-reading School Bus Driver Steers Students Toward Love Of Reading] \u2013 video produced by [[Wisconsin Public Television]]\n{{navboxes|list1=\n{{North American School Bus Manufacturers}}\n{{North American bus builders}}\n{{Buses}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:School Bus}}\n[[Category:Buses by type]]\n[[Category:School buses| ]]\n[[Category:Student transport]]\n", "name_user": "24.19.172.173", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_bus"}

He also studied music with Johann Polischansky during his apprenticeship and eventually managed to secure a place in a local orchestra, headed by Michael Pamer. Strauss left the orchestra to join a popular string quartet known as the ''Lanner Quartet'', formed by his would-be rivals Joseph Lanner and the Drahanek brothers, Karl and Johann. This string quartet playing [[Viennese Waltz]]es and rustic German dances expanded into a small string orchestra in 1824.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nStrauss became deputy [[Conducting|conductor]] of the orchestra to assist Lanner in commissions after it became so popular during the [[Carnival|Fasching]] of 1824 and Strauss was soon placed in command of a second smaller orchestra which was formed as a result of the success of the parent orchestra. In 1825, he decided to form his own band and began to write music (chiefly, dance music) for it to play after he realized that he could also possibly emulate the success of Lanner in addition to putting an end to his financial struggles. By so doing, he would have made Lanner a serious rival although the rivalry did not entail hostile consequences as the musical competition was very productive for the development of the waltz as well as other dance music in Vienna.\n\nHe soon became one of the best-known and well loved dance composers in Vienna. During the carnival of 1826, Strauss inaugurated his long line of triumphs by introducing his band to the public of Vienna at the {{lang|de|Schwan}} in the suburb of [[Ro\u00dfau]] where his [[T\u00e4uberln-Walzer]] (Op. 1) at once established his reputation.<ref name=eb9>{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Strauss, Johann|volume=22}}</ref> He toured with his band to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Britain. The conducting reins and management of this Strauss Orchestra would eventually be passed on to the hands of his sons until its disbandment by Eduard Strauss in 1901.\n\nOn a trip to France in 1837 he heard the [[quadrille]] and began to compose them himself, becoming largely responsible for introducing that dance to Austria in the 1840 Fasching, where it became very popular. It was this very trip (in 1837) which has proved Strauss' popularity with audiences from different social backgrounds and this paved the way to forming an ambitious plan to perform his music in England for the coronation of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1838. Strauss also adapted various popular melodies of his day into his works so as to ensure a wider audience, as evidenced in the incorporation of the ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]'' [[overture]] into his early waltz, \"[[Wiener Carneval]]\", Op. 3, and also the French [[national anthem]] \"[[La Marseillaise]]\" into his \"Paris-Walzer\", Op. 101.\n\n[[File:Johann Strauss I (1).jpg|thumb|upright|Johann Strauss I, 1837]]\nStrauss married Maria Anna Streim in 1825 in the Roman Catholic [[Lichtental Parish Church]] in Vienna. The marriage was relatively unhappy due to his prolonged absences caused by frequent tours abroad which led to a gradual alienation. They had seven children; [[Johann Strauss II|Johann]], [[Josef Strauss|Josef]] and [[Eduard Strauss]], the last of whom had a son called [[Johann Strauss III]]. Strauss Sr. also had two daughters, Anna, who was born in 1829, and Therese, who was born in 1831. His third son, Ferdinand, born in 1834, lived only ten months.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe family home was called 'Hirschenhaus' but was better known in Vienna as the 'Goldener Hirsch' (The Golden Stag). Strauss was a strict disciplinarian and demanded that none of his sons pursue careers in music, despite their display of musical talent. Johann Junior was to study banking, likewise his brother [[Josef Strauss]] was destined for a military career, whereas the youngest [[Eduard Strauss]] was expected to join the [[House of Habsburg|Austrian]] [[Consul (representative)|consulate]].\n\nBy 1834 Strauss had taken a mistress, Emilie Trampusch, with whom he had eight<ref>[[Michael Lorenz (musicologist)|Michael Lorenz]]: [http://www.members.aon.at/michaelorenz/strauss/ \"Familie Trampusch \u2013 geliebt und totgeschwiegen\"], ''Jahrbuch des Vereins f\u00fcr Geschichte der Stadt Wien'', Vol. 62/63, 2006/2007, (Vienna: Verein f\u00fcr Geschichte der Stadt Wien, 2011), 135\u201349.</ref> children. When her husband openly acknowledged his paternity of a daughter born to Emilie in 1844, Maria Anna sued for divorce. With the ending of the marriage Anna Strauss determined to further Johann Strauss II's musical career, allowing him to develop his skills as a composer.\n\nDespite family problems, Strauss senior continued to tour frequently and was always prepared to write novelty pieces for numerous charitable organizations. His waltzes were gradually developed from a rustic peasant dance into one which posterity would recognize as the [[Viennese Waltz]]. They were written in three-quarter time with a short introduction; often with little or no reference to the later chain of five two-part waltz structure; usually appended with a short coda and concluded in a stirring finish, although his son Johann Strauss II expanded the waltz structure and utilized more instruments than his father. While he did not possess a musical talent as rich as his eldest son's, nor a business mind as astute, he was among the handful of early waltz composers along with Joseph Lanner to actively write pieces with individual titles \u2014 with the view to boost sales of their sheet music \u2014 which enabled music enthusiasts to easily recognize those pieces. In fact, during his performances at the Sperl-Ballroom in Vienna, where he established his name, he actively pursued the concept of collecting a fixed entrance fee from the patrons of the ballroom instead of the old practice of passing around a collection plate where income was reliant on the goodwill of the patrons.\n\n[[File:ZentralfriedhofStraussJohannVater.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Johann Strauss I, [[Zentralfriedhof]], Vienna, Austria]]\nJohann Strauss II often played his father's works and openly declared his admiration of them, although it was no secret to the Viennese that their rivalry was intense, with the press at that time fueling it. Johann Strauss I himself refused to play ever again at the Dommayer's Casino, which offered his son his conducting debut, and was to tower over his son during his lifetime in terms of career advancement, although Strauss II was to eclipse him in terms of popularity in the classical repertoire. In 1846, Johann Strauss I was awarded the honorary title of ''K.K. Hofballmusikdirektor'' (Director of Music for the Imperial and Royal Court Balls) by Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]].\n\nStrauss died in Vienna on September 25, 1849 at the age of 45 from [[scarlet fever]] contracted from one of his illegitimate children.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52380pg1?q=johann+strauss+i&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit |title=Johann Strauss I on Grove Music Online |accessdate=5 October 2008|publisher=Grove Music Online }}</ref> He was buried at the D\u00f6blinger cemetery beside his friend Joseph Lanner.

During the carnival of 1826, Strauss inaugurated his long line of triumphs by introducing his band to the public of Vienna at the {{lang|de|Schwan}} in the suburb of [[Ro\u00dfau]] where his [[T\u00e4uberln-Walzer]] (Op. 1) at once established his reputation.<ref name=eb9>{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Strauss, Johann|volume=22}}</ref> He toured with his band to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Britain. The conducting reins and management of this Strauss Orchestra would eventually be passed on to the hands of his sons until its disbandment by Eduard Strauss in 1901.\n\nOn a trip to France in 1837 he heard the [[quadrille]] and began to compose them himself, becoming largely responsible for introducing that dance to Austria in the 1840 Fasching, where it became very popular. It was this very trip (in 1837) which has proved Strauss' popularity with audiences from different social backgrounds and this paved the way to forming an ambitious plan to perform his music in England for the coronation of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1838. Strauss also adapted various popular melodies of his day into his works so as to ensure a wider audience, as evidenced in the incorporation of the ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]'' [[overture]] into his early waltz, \"[[Wiener Carneval]]\", Op. 3, and also the French [[national anthem]] \"[[La Marseillaise]]\" into his \"Paris-Walzer\", Op. 101.\n\n[[File:Johann Strauss I (1).jpg|thumb|upright|Johann Strauss I, 1837]]\nStrauss married Maria Anna Streim in 1825 in the Roman Catholic [[Lichtental Parish Church]] in Vienna. The marriage was relatively unhappy due to his prolonged absences caused by frequent tours abroad which led to a gradual alienation. They had seven children; [[Johann Strauss II|Johann]], [[Josef Strauss|Josef]] and [[Eduard Strauss]], the last of whom had a son called [[Johann Strauss III]]. Strauss Sr. also had two daughters, Anna, who was born in 1829, and Therese, who was born in 1831. His third son, Ferdinand, born in 1834, lived only ten months.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe family home was called 'Hirschenhaus' but was better known in Vienna as the 'Goldener Hirsch' (The Golden Stag). Strauss was a strict disciplinarian and demanded that none of his sons pursue careers in music, despite their display of musical talent. Johann Junior was to study banking, likewise his brother [[Josef Strauss]] was destined for a military career, whereas the youngest [[Eduard Strauss]] was expected to join the [[House of Habsburg|Austrian]] [[Consul (representative)|consulate]].\n\nBy 1834 Strauss had taken a mistress, Emilie Trampusch, with whom he had eight<ref>[[Michael Lorenz (musicologist)|Michael Lorenz]]: [http://www.members.aon.at/michaelorenz/strauss/ \"Familie Trampusch \u2013 geliebt und totgeschwiegen\"], ''Jahrbuch des Vereins f\u00fcr Geschichte der Stadt Wien'', Vol. 62/63, 2006/2007, (Vienna: Verein f\u00fcr Geschichte der Stadt Wien, 2011), 135\u201349.</ref> children. When her husband openly acknowledged his paternity of a daughter born to Emilie in 1844, Maria Anna sued for divorce. With the ending of the marriage Anna Strauss determined to further Johann Strauss II's musical career, allowing him to develop his skills as a composer.\n\nDespite family problems, Strauss senior continued to tour frequently and was always prepared to write novelty pieces for numerous charitable organizations. His waltzes were gradually developed from a rustic peasant dance into one which posterity would recognize as the [[Viennese Waltz]]. They were written in three-quarter time with a short introduction; often with little or no reference to the later chain of five two-part waltz structure; usually appended with a short coda and concluded in a stirring finish, although his son Johann Strauss II expanded the waltz structure and utilized more instruments than his father. While he did not possess a musical talent as rich as his eldest son's, nor a business mind as astute, he was among the handful of early waltz composers along with Joseph Lanner to actively write pieces with individual titles \u2014 with the view to boost sales of their sheet music \u2014 which enabled music enthusiasts to easily recognize those pieces. In fact, during his performances at the Sperl-Ballroom in Vienna, where he established his name, he actively pursued the concept of collecting a fixed entrance fee from the patrons of the ballroom instead of the old practice of passing around a collection plate where income was reliant on the goodwill of the patrons.\n\n[[File:ZentralfriedhofStraussJohannVater.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Johann Strauss I, [[Zentralfriedhof]], Vienna, Austria]]\nJohann Strauss II often played his father's works and openly declared his admiration of them, although it was no secret to the Viennese that their rivalry was intense, with the press at that time fueling it. Johann Strauss I himself refused to play ever again at the Dommayer's Casino, which offered his son his conducting debut, and was to tower over his son during his lifetime in terms of career advancement, although Strauss II was to eclipse him in terms of popularity in the classical repertoire. In 1846, Johann Strauss I was awarded the honorary title of ''K.K. Hofballmusikdirektor'' (Director of Music for the Imperial and Royal Court Balls) by Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]].\n\nStrauss died in Vienna on September 25, 1849 at the age of 45 from [[scarlet fever]] contracted from one of his illegitimate children.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52380pg1?q=johann+strauss+i&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit |title=Johann Strauss I on Grove Music Online |accessdate=5 October 2008|publisher=Grove Music Online }}</ref> He was buried at the D\u00f6blinger cemetery beside his friend Joseph Lanner.

Nolan's films have grossed over $4.7 billion worldwide, making him one of the most [[List of highest-grossing directors|commercially successful directors in history]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-star-records/worldwide/lifetime-specific-technical-role/director|title=Top Grossing Director At The Worldwide Box Office|publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|accessdate=January 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHis feature debut was the neo-noir crime thriller ''[[Following]]'' (1998) followed by the psychological thriller ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000)\u2014his breakthrough film. Nolan made the transition to studio filmmaking with the critically acclaimed thriller ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'' (2002), and became a household name with ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005\u20132012), ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006), and ''[[Inception]]'' (2010). His most recent films are ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'' (2014) and ''[[Dunkirk (2017 film)|Dunkirk]]'' (2017). Nolan is regarded as an auteur filmmaker and has acknowledged that many of his films are heavily influenced by [[film noir]]. He is partial to documentary-style lighting, [[hand-held camera]] work, natural settings, and real filming locations over studio work. Embedded narratives and crosscutting between different time frames is a major component of his work, and his films often feature experimental soundscapes. Nolan prefers shooting on [[Photographic film|film]] to [[digital video]] and  advocates for the use of higher-quality, larger-format film stock.\n\nHis work explores [[Existentialism|existential]], [[ethics|ethical]], and [[epistemological]] themes such as subjective experience, distortion of memory, human morality, the nature of time, [[causality]], and the construction of personal identity. His characters are often emotionally disturbed, obsessive, and morally ambiguous, facing the fears and anxieties of loneliness, guilt, jealousy, and greed. Nolan also uses his real-life experiences as an inspiration in his work. Nolan's most prominent recurring theme is the concept of time; questions concerning the nature of existence and reality also play a major role in his body of work.\n\nNolan's wife, [[Emma Thomas]], has co-produced all of his films, and he has co-written several of his films with his younger brother, [[Jonathan Nolan]]. Other frequent collaborators include editor [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]], cinematographers [[Wally Pfister]] and [[Hoyte van Hoytema]], composer [[Hans Zimmer]], sound designer [[Richard King (sound designer)|Richard King]], production designer [[Nathan Crowley]], casting director [[John Papsidera]], as well as actors [[Michael Caine]], [[Cillian Murphy]] and [[Tom Hardy]].\n\n{{TOC

Nolan's films typically deceive spectators about the events that occur and the motivations of the characters, but they do not abandon the idea of truth altogether. Instead, \"They show us how truth must emerge out of the lie if it is not to lead us entirely astray.\" McGowan further argues that Nolan is the first filmmaker to devote himself entirely to the illusion of the medium, calling him a [[Hegel]]ian filmmaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/mcgfic|title=The Fictional Christopher Nolan|last=McGowan |first=Todd |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|accessdate=5 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005200914/http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/mcgfic|archive-date=5 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Inception'', Nolan was inspired by [[lucid dreaming]] and [[dream incubation]].<ref>{{cite web|date=16 July 2010|title=Inside 'Inception': Could Christopher Nolan's Dream World Exist in Real Life?

However sophisticated your computer-generated imagery is, if it's been created from no physical elements and you haven't shot anything, it's going to feel like animation. There are usually two different goals in a visual effects movie. One is to fool the audience into seeing something seamless, and that's how I try to use it. The other is to impress the audience with the amount of money spent on the spectacle of the visual effect, and that, I have no interest in.<ref name=\"Ressner\"/></blockquote> Nolan shoots the entirety of his films with one unit, rather than using a [[second unit]] for action sequences. That way, he keeps his personality and point of view in every aspect of the film. \"If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why do I need to be there at all?

Nolan argued for the artistic merits of film on the grounds of \"[[medium specificity]]\", which highlights the importance that a work shot on film be presented in its original format, and \"medium resistance\", that the artist's choice of what medium is used to create a work will further effect choices in how a work is made.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/votd-90-minute-sundance-panel-with-christopher-nolan-and-more/|title=VOTD: Sundance's 90-Minute Art of Film Panel with Christopher Nolan and Colin Trevorrow|last=Anderton |first=Ethan |accessdate=23 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323054921/https://www.slashfilm.com/votd-90-minute-sundance-panel-with-christopher-nolan-and-more/|archive-date=23 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Movie theaters ===\nNolan is an advocate for the importance of films being shown in large-screen cinema theatres as opposed to home video formats, as he believes that, \"The theatrical window is to the movie business what live concerts are to the music business{{snd}}and no one goes to a concert to be played an MP3 on a bare stage.\"<ref name=\"WallStreet\"/> In 2014 Christopher Nolan wrote an article for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' where he expressed concern that as the film industry transitions away from photochemical film towards digital formats, the difference between seeing films in theatres versus on other formats will become trivialised, leaving audiences no incentive to seek out a theatrical experience. Nolan further expressed concern that with content digitised, theatres of the future will be able to track best-selling films and adjust their programming accordingly, a process that favours large heavily marketed studio films, but will marginalise smaller innovative and unconventional pictures. To combat this, Nolan believes the industry needs to focus on improving the theatrical experience with bigger and more beautiful presentation formats that cannot be accessed or reproduced in the home, as well as embracing the new generation of aspiring young innovative filmmakers.<ref name=\"WallStreet\">{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/articles/christopher-nolan-films-of-the-future-will-still-draw-people-to-theaters-1404762696|title=Christopher Nolan: Films of the Future Will Still Draw People to Theaters|last=Nolan |first=Christopher |work=The Wall Street Journal|date=7 July 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712010115/http://online.wsj.com/articles/christopher-nolan-films-of-the-future-will-still-draw-people-to-theaters-1404762696|archive-date=12 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Nolan assisted in the 2019 renovation of the [[Directors Guild of America|DGA]] theatre in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"DGA-reno\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/first-look-dga-unveils-renovated-theater-help-jon-favreau-1240214|title=First Look: Directors Guild Unveils Renovated Theater With Help From Jon Favreau, Christopher Nolan and More|last=Kiefer |first=Peter |work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=17 September 2019|accessdate=21 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190921104218/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/first-look-dga-unveils-renovated-theater-help-jon-favreau-1240214|archive-date=21 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Nolan wrote about the social and cultural importance of movie theaters in an article published by ''[[The Washington Post]]''.

Nolan films have grossed over $4.7 billion worldwide, making him one of the most [[List of highest-grossing directors|commercially successful directors in history]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-star-records/worldwide/lifetime-specific-technical-role/director|title=Top Grossing Director At The Worldwide Box Office|publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|accessdate=January 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHis feature debut was the neo-noir crime thriller ''[[Following]]'' (1998) followed by the psychological thriller ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000)\u2014his breakthrough film. Nolan made the transition to studio filmmaking with the critically acclaimed thriller ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'' (2002), and became a household name with ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005\u20132012), ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006), and ''[[Inception]]'' (2010). His most recent films are ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'' (2014) and ''[[Dunkirk (2017 film)|Dunkirk]]'' (2017). Nolan is regarded as an auteur filmmaker and has acknowledged that many of his films are heavily influenced by [[film noir]]. He is partial to documentary-style lighting, [[hand-held camera]] work, natural settings, and real filming locations over studio work. Embedded narratives and crosscutting between different time frames is a major component of his work, and his films often feature experimental soundscapes. Nolan prefers shooting on [[Photographic film|film]] to [[digital video]] and  advocates for the use of higher-quality, larger-format film stock.\n\nHis work explores [[Existentialism|existential]], [[ethics|ethical]], and [[epistemological]] themes such as subjective experience, distortion of memory, human morality, the nature of time, [[causality]], and the construction of personal identity. His characters are often emotionally disturbed, obsessive, and morally ambiguous, facing the fears and anxieties of loneliness, guilt, jealousy, and greed. Nolan also uses his real-life experiences as an inspiration in his work. Nolan's most prominent recurring theme is the concept of time; questions concerning the nature of existence and reality also play a major role in his body of work.\n\nNolan's wife, [[Emma Thomas]], has co-produced all of his films, and he has co-written several of his films with his younger brother, [[Jonathan Nolan]]. Other frequent collaborators include editor [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]], cinematographers [[Wally Pfister]] and [[Hoyte van Hoytema]], composer [[Hans Zimmer]], sound designer [[Richard King (sound designer)|Richard King]], production designer [[Nathan Crowley]], casting director [[John Papsidera]], as well as actors [[Michael Caine]], [[Cillian Murphy]] and [[Tom Hardy]].\n\n{{TOC

However sophisticated your computer-generated imagery is, if it's been created from no physical elements and you haven't shot anything, it's going to feel like animation. There are usually two different goals in a visual effects movie. One is to fool the audience into seeing something seamless, and that's how I try to use it. The other is to impress the audience with the amount of money spent on the spectacle of the visual effect, and that, I have no interest in.<ref name=\"Ressner\"/></blockquote> Nolan shoots the entirety of his films with one unit, rather than using a [[second unit]] for action sequences. That way, he keeps his personality and point of view in every aspect of the film. \"If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why do I need to be there at all?

Nolan argued for the artistic merits of film on the grounds of \"[[medium specificity]]\", which highlights the importance that a work shot on film be presented in its original format, and \"medium resistance\", that the artist's choice of what medium is used to create a work will further effect choices in how a work is made.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/votd-90-minute-sundance-panel-with-christopher-nolan-and-more/|title=VOTD: Sundance's 90-Minute Art of Film Panel with Christopher Nolan and Colin Trevorrow|last=Anderton |first=Ethan |accessdate=23 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323054921/https://www.slashfilm.com/votd-90-minute-sundance-panel-with-christopher-nolan-and-more/|archive-date=23 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Movie theaters ===\nNolan is an advocate for the importance of films being shown in large-screen cinema theatres as opposed to home video formats, as he believes that, \"The theatrical window is to the movie business what live concerts are to the music business{{snd}}and no one goes to a concert to be played an MP3 on a bare stage.\"<ref name=\"WallStreet\"/> In 2014 Christopher Nolan wrote an article for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' where he expressed concern that as the film industry transitions away from photochemical film towards digital formats, the difference between seeing films in theatres versus on other formats will become trivialised, leaving audiences no incentive to seek out a theatrical experience. Nolan further expressed concern that with content digitised, theatres of the future will be able to track best-selling films and adjust their programming accordingly, a process that favours large heavily marketed studio films, but will marginalise smaller innovative and unconventional pictures. To combat this, Nolan believes the industry needs to focus on improving the theatrical experience with bigger and more beautiful presentation formats that cannot be accessed or reproduced in the home, as well as embracing the new generation of aspiring young innovative filmmakers.<ref name=\"WallStreet\">{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/articles/christopher-nolan-films-of-the-future-will-still-draw-people-to-theaters-1404762696|title=Christopher Nolan: Films of the Future Will Still Draw People to Theaters|last=Nolan |first=Christopher |work=The Wall Street Journal|date=7 July 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712010115/http://online.wsj.com/articles/christopher-nolan-films-of-the-future-will-still-draw-people-to-theaters-1404762696|archive-date=12 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Nolan assisted in the 2019 renovation of the [[Directors Guild of America|DGA]] theatre in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"DGA-reno\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/first-look-dga-unveils-renovated-theater-help-jon-favreau-1240214|title=First Look: Directors Guild Unveils Renovated Theater With Help From Jon Favreau, Christopher Nolan and More|last=Kiefer |first=Peter |work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=17 September 2019|accessdate=21 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190921104218/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/first-look-dga-unveils-renovated-theater-help-jon-favreau-1240214|archive-date=21 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Nolan wrote about the social and cultural importance of movie theaters in an article published by ''[[The Washington Post]]''. He called it \"the most affordable and democratic of our community gathering places\", and asked the [[United States Congress|Congress]] to remember the theaters and their workers in plans for financial relief in the wake of shutdowns. \"I hope that people are seeing our exhibition community for what it really is: a vital part of social life, providing jobs for many and entertainment for all.

Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data.

Emergence of resistance often reflects [[evolution]]ary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic treatment may [[natural selection|select]] for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug.<ref name=\"Balancing the drug-resistance equation\"/> For example, antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the [[Luria\u2013Delbr\u00fcck experiment]].<ref name=\"Mutations of Bacteria from Virus Sensitivity to Virus Resistance\"/> Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains.<ref name=\"voanews.com\"/>\n\nResistance may take the form of biodegredation of pharmaceuticals, such as sulfamethazine-degrading soil bacteria introduced to sulfamethazine through medicated pig feces.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Topp E, Chapman R, Devers-Lamrani M, Hartmann A, Marti R, Martin-Laurent F, Sabourin L, Scott A, Sumarah M |title= Accelerated Biodegradation of Veterinary Antibiotics in Agricultural Soil following Long-Term Exposure, and Isolation of a Sulfamethazine-degrading sp |journal= Journal of Environmental Quality |volume= 42 |issue= 1 |pages= 173\u20138 |year= 2013 |pmid= 23673752 |doi= 10.2134/jeq2012.0162 |url= http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/abstract/?id=27587000000610}}</ref>\nThe survival of bacteria often results from an inheritable resistance,<ref name=\"Witte2004\"/> but the growth of resistance to antibacterials also occurs through [[horizontal gene transfer]].

Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
