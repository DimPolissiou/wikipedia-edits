During the eighth [[inning]] with the score tied 2\u20132, [[1954 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] batter [[Vic Wertz]] hit a deep [[Batted ball|fly ball]] to [[Center fielder|center field]] that was poised to score the [[Base running|runners on base]]. However, Mays made an over-the-shoulder [[Catch (baseball)|catch]] while on the run to record the [[Out (baseball)|out]], and his throw back to the [[Infield#Baseball|infield]] prevented the runners from advancing.

Having caught the ball, he immediately spun and threw the ball. Doby, the runner on second, might have been able to score the go-ahead run had he tagged at the moment the ball was caught; as it was, he ran when the ball was hit, then had to scramble back to tag.

Catch (disambiguation)}}\n[[Image:The Catch.png|thumb|[[Willie Mays]] catches [[Vic Wertz]]'s deep [[Batted ball|fly ball]] on the [[warning track]] in the [[1954 World Series]].]]\n'''The Catch''' was a [[baseball]] play made by [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] center fielder [[Willie Mays]] on September 29, 1954, during Game 1 of the [[1954 World Series]] at the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[Upper Manhattan|Upper Manhattan, New York City]]. During the eighth [[inning]] with the score tied 2\u20132, [[1954 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] batter [[Vic Wertz]] hit a deep [[Batted ball|fly ball]] to [[Center fielder|center field]] that was poised to score the [[Base running|runners on base]]. However, Mays made an over-the-shoulder [[Catch (baseball)|catch]] while on the run to record the [[Out (baseball)|out]], and his throw back to the [[Infield#Baseball|infield]] prevented the runners from advancing. The Giants won the game 5\u20132 in [[extra innings]], and eventually the World Series. The Catch is regarded as one of the greatest plays in baseball history.\n\n==The play==\nIn the top of the 8th inning with the score tied 2\u20132,<ref>{{cite news|last=Bahr|first=Chris|title=Flashback: Willie Mays makes 'The Catch' in 1954 World Series|url=http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/willie-mays-catch-1954-world-series-new-york-giants-san-francisco-hall-of-famer-vic-wertz-092915|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=September 29, 2015|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}</ref> Giants starting [[pitcher]] [[Sal Maglie]] [[base on balls|walked]] Indians lead off hitter [[Larry Doby]].

In many stadiums the ball would have been a [[home run]], which would have given the Indians a 5\u20132 lead. However, the Polo Grounds center field was larger than average, and Mays, who was playing in shallow center field, made an on-the-run, over-the-shoulder catch at the [[warning track]] for the out. Having caught the ball, he immediately spun and threw the ball. Doby, the runner on second, might have been able to score the go-ahead run had he tagged at the moment the ball was caught; as it was, he ran when the ball was hit, then had to scramble back to tag.

Jesus accepted the offering, held it to his face, and then handed it back to her\u2014the image of his face miraculously impressed upon it. This piece of cloth became known as the [[Veil of Veronica]].<ref name=\"N&Q\" /><ref name=\"AI\" /><ref name=\"Butler2000p=84\" />\nThe story of Veronica is celebrated in the sixth [[Stations of the Cross|Station of the Cross]] in many [[Anglican]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Western Orthodox]] churches.<ref name=Trinity/><ref>Vatican Website [https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/2005/via_crucis/en/station_06.html Sixth Station]</ref><ref name=\"Prothero2009p=284\" />\n\n== Background==\n[[File:Saint veronica.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Veronica by [[Francesco Mochi]] in a niche of the pier supporting the main dome of [[St. Peter's Basilica]].]]\n[[File:Cloth_of_St._Veronica,_Bernardino_Zaganelli,_c._1500,_oil_on_panel,_Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art.jpg|left|thumb|''Cloth of Saint Veronica'', [[Bernardino Zaganelli]], c. 1500, oil on panel, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]\n[[File:Veronica.jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s 1513 ''Veronica'']]\nThere is no reference to the story of Veronica and her veil in the [[canonical gospels]]. The closest is the miracle of the unnamed woman who was healed by touching the hem of Jesus\u2019s garment (Luke 8:43\u201348). The [[apocrypha]]l [[Gospel of Nicodemus]] gives her name as Berenik\u0113 or Beronike ({{lang-grc-koi|\u0392\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7}}). The name Veronica is a Latinisation of this [[ancient Macedonian language|ancient Macedonian]] name. The story was later elaborated in the 11th century by adding that Christ gave her a portrait of himself on a cloth, with which she later cured the Emperor [[Tiberius]]. The linking of this with the bearing of the cross in the Passion only occurs around 1380, in the internationally popular book ''Meditations on the life of Christ''.<ref name=\"Wilson1991p=175\" />\n\nAt some point a relic became associated with the story. [[Pedro Tafur]], a Spanish knight visiting Rome in 1436, describes the following in the Church of St. Peter in his 1454 travel account:<ref name=\"Letts1926\" />\n{{quote|\nOn the right hand is a pillar as high as a small tower, and in it is the holy Veronica. When it is to be exhibited an opening is made in the roof of the church and a wooden chest or cradle is let down, in which are two clerics, and when they have descended, the chest or cradle is drawn up, and they, with the greatest reverence, take out the Veronica and show it to the people, who make concourse there upon the appointed day. It happens often that the worshipers are in danger of their lives, so many are they and so great is the press.\n|source=}}\n\nHowever, he does not say specifically that he witnessed for himself this exhibition of the relic. \n\nSome academic sources suggest a different origin for the legend of St. Veronica: that the cloth bearing an image of Jesus' face was known in Latin as the ''vera icon'' (\"true image\"), and that this name for the relic was misinterpreted as the name of a saint. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' of 1913 writes:<ref name=\"D\u00e9gert1913\" />\n{{quote|\nThe belief in the existence of authentic images of Christ is connected with the old legend of King [[Abgar V|Abgar of Edessa]] and the apocryphal writing known as the ''\"[[Pontius Pilate#Minor Pilate literature|Mors Pilati]]\"'' (''\"the Death of [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]]\"''). To distinguish at Rome the oldest and best known of these images it was called the ''vera icon'' (true image), which in the common tongue soon became ''\"Veronica.\"''\nIt is thus designated in several [[medieval]] texts mentioned by the [[Bollandist]]s (e.g. an old Missal of Augsburg has a Mass ''\"De S. Veronica seu Vultus Domini\"'' \u2013 ''\"Saint Veronica, or the Face of the Lord\"''), and [[Matthew of Westminster]] speaks of the imprint of the image of the Savior which is called Veronica: ''\"Effigies Domenici vultus quae Veronica nuncupatur\"'' \u2013 ''\"effigy of the face of the Lord which is called a Veronica\"''. By degrees, popular imagination mistook this word for the name of a person and attached thereto several legends which vary according to the country. [''translations in italics added'']\n|source=}}\n\nThe reference to Abgar is related to a similar legend in the Eastern Church, the [[Image of Edessa]] or Mandylion.\n\nThe ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' says this about the legend:\n{{quote|\nEusebius in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' (vii 18) tells how at [[Caesarea Philippi]] lived the [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman|woman whom Christ healed of an issue of blood]] ([[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 9|Matthew 9]]:20\u201322). Legend was not long in providing the woman of the Gospel with a name. In the West she was identified with [[Martha|Martha of Bethany]]; in the East she was called Berenike, or Beronike, the name appearing in as early a work as the ''\"[[Acta Pilati]]\",'' the most ancient form of which goes back to the fourth century. The fanciful derivation of the name Veronica from the words Vera Icon (eikon) \"true image\" dates back to the ''\"Otia Imperialia\"'' (iii 25) of [[Gervase of Tilbury]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1211), who says: ''\"Est ergo Veronica pictura Domini vera\"'' (translated: \"The Veronica is, therefore, a true picture of the Lord.\")\n|source=}}\n\nVeronica was mentioned in the reported [[visions of Jesus and Mary|visions of Jesus]] by [[Marie of St Peter]], a [[Carmelites|Carmelite nun]] who lived in [[Tours]], France and started the [[Catholic devotions|devotion]] to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]]. In 1844, Sister Marie reported that in a vision, she saw Veronica wiping away the spit and mud from the face of Jesus with her veil on the way to Calvary. She said that sacrilegious and blasphemous acts today are adding to the spit and mud that Veronica wiped away that day. According to Marie of St Peter, in her visions, Jesus told her that he desired devotion to His Holy Face in [[reparation (legal)|reparation]] for [[sacrilege]] and [[blasphemy]]. [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]] are thus compared to Veronica wiping the face of Jesus.<ref name=\"Cruz2003p=\" /><ref name=\"ScallanScallan1994p=\" />\n\nThe Devotion to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]] was eventually approved by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1885. Veronica is commemorated on 12 July.\n\n== Official Patronage ==\nSaint Veronica is the patron of the French [[Mulquinerie|mulquiniers]] whose representations they celebrated biannually ([[summer]] and [[winter]]) as in many pious [[Christianity by country|Christian countries]]. She is also the patron saint of photographers.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Veronicazejtun.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of ''Veronica,'' used during the [[Good Friday]] [[procession]] in [[Zejtun]], [[Malta]].]]\nIn Volume 5 of her work, ''[[The Poem of the Man-God]]'', Italian writer and alleged mystic [[Maria Valtorta]] depicts Veronica as Nike, who offered the linen cloth to Christ. It is also stated earlier in the same volume that \"The one we call Veronica and whom Jesus called Nike...\" suggesting that Nike has been mistakenly referred to as Veronica throughout history.<ref name=\"Valtorta1956pp=305-316\" />\n\n[[Selma Lagerl\u00f6f]] in Christ Legends<ref name=\"Lagerl\u00f6f1908p=119\" /> expands the legend by making Veronica a former servant of the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]], named Faustina, who travels to Jerusalem in search of the Prophet of Nazareth, after learning that he once cured a young woman of leprosy. She travels on behalf of Tiberius, now himself stricken,  hoping to bring him a cure and redemption from his evil ways.  Faustina arrives on the day of the Crucifixion, and the rest is legend.\n\nMel Gibson's film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (2004) included an episode of Veronica wiping Jesus's face, although she is not referred to by name in the film (she is credited in the film as Seraphia). [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]], one of the inspirational sources to the cited movie, depicts a long description of the Veronica episode and she identifies the true name of Veronica also as Seraphia.<ref name=\"Emmerich1862p=239\" />\n\nThe most common pass with the cape in [[bullfighting]] is called a ''ver\u00f3nica'', as the ''[[torero]]'' holds the cape in the same way as Veronica is usually depicted holding the cloth.\n\nThe song \"Climb\" by [[Tori Amos]] on her 2017 album ''[[Native Invader]]'' contains repeated references to Veronica.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Scapular of the Holy Face]]\n* [[List of names for the biblical nameless]]\n* [[Relics associated with Jesus]]\n* [[Veil of Veronica|Veronica's Veil]]\n* [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 9|Matthew 9]]\n* [[s:Bible (King James)/Mark#Chapter 5|Mark 5]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"catholic.org\">[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1953 Catholic Online]</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"N&Q\">{{citation |title=St. Veronica |journal=Notes and Queries |volume= 6 |date=July\u2013December 1852 |location= London |page=252 |url=https://archive.org/stream/notesqueriesmedi06lond#page/252/mode/1up}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"sqpn.com\">{{webarchive| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080512064350/http://saints.sqpn.com/saintv02.htm |title=Saint Veronica }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Trinity>{{cite web |url= http://www.trinityevansville.org/stations-of-the-cross/ |title= Stations of the Cross |date=24 March 2013 |publisher= Trinity UMC |access-date=17 April 2015 |quote= This tradition began most prominently with St. Francis of Assisi (1182\u20131226) and spread to other churches in the medieval period.

Jesus accepted the offering, held it to his face, and then handed it back to her\u2014the image of his face miraculously impressed upon it. This piece of cloth became known as the [[Veil of Veronica]].<ref name=\"N&Q\" /><ref name=\"AI\" /><ref name=\"Butler2000p=84\" />\nThe story of Veronica is celebrated in the sixth [[Stations of the Cross|Station of the Cross]] in many [[Anglican]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Western Orthodox]] churches.<ref name=Trinity/><ref>Vatican Website [https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/2005/via_crucis/en/station_06.html Sixth Station]</ref><ref name=\"Prothero2009p=284\" />\n\n== Background==\n[[File:Saint veronica.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Veronica by [[Francesco Mochi]] in a niche of the pier supporting the main dome of [[St. Peter's Basilica]].]]\n[[File:Cloth_of_St._Veronica,_Bernardino_Zaganelli,_c._1500,_oil_on_panel,_Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art.jpg|left|thumb|''Cloth of Saint Veronica'', [[Bernardino Zaganelli]], c. 1500, oil on panel, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]\n[[File:Veronica.jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s 1513 ''Veronica'']]\nThere is no reference to the story of Veronica and her veil in the [[canonical gospels]]. The closest is the miracle of the unnamed woman who was healed by touching the hem of Jesus\u2019s garment (Luke 8:43\u201348). The [[apocrypha]]l [[Gospel of Nicodemus]] gives her name as Berenik\u0113 or Beronike ({{lang-grc-koi|\u0392\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7}}). The name Veronica is a Latinisation of this [[ancient Macedonian language|ancient Macedonian]] name. The story was later elaborated in the 11th century by adding that Christ gave her a portrait of himself on a cloth, with which she later cured the Emperor [[Tiberius]]. The linking of this with the bearing of the cross in the Passion only occurs around 1380, in the internationally popular book ''Meditations on the life of Christ''.<ref name=\"Wilson1991p=175\" />\n\nAt some point a relic became associated with the story. [[Pedro Tafur]], a Spanish knight visiting Rome in 1436, describes the following in the Church of St. Peter in his 1454 travel account:<ref name=\"Letts1926\" />\n{{quote|\nOn the right hand is a pillar as high as a small tower, and in it is the holy Veronica. When it is to be exhibited an opening is made in the roof of the church and a wooden chest or cradle is let down, in which are two clerics, and when they have descended, the chest or cradle is drawn up, and they, with the greatest reverence, take out the Veronica and show it to the people, who make concourse there upon the appointed day. It happens often that the worshipers are in danger of their lives, so many are they and so great is the press.\n|source=}}\n\nHowever, he does not say specifically that he witnessed for himself this exhibition of the relic. \n\nSome academic sources suggest a different origin for the legend of St. Veronica: that the cloth bearing an image of Jesus' face was known in Latin as the ''vera icon'' (\"true image\"), and that this name for the relic was misinterpreted as the name of a saint. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' of 1913 writes:<ref name=\"D\u00e9gert1913\" />\n{{quote|\nThe belief in the existence of authentic images of Christ is connected with the old legend of King [[Abgar V|Abgar of Edessa]] and the apocryphal writing known as the ''\"[[Pontius Pilate#Minor Pilate literature|Mors Pilati]]\"'' (''\"the Death of [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]]\"''). To distinguish at Rome the oldest and best known of these images it was called the ''vera icon'' (true image), which in the common tongue soon became ''\"Veronica.\"''\nIt is thus designated in several [[medieval]] texts mentioned by the [[Bollandist]]s (e.g. an old Missal of Augsburg has a Mass ''\"De S. Veronica seu Vultus Domini\"'' - ''\"Saint Veronica, or the Face of the Lord\"''), and [[Matthew of Westminster]] speaks of the imprint of the image of the Savior which is called Veronica: ''\"Effigies Domenici vultus quae Veronica nuncupatur\"'' - ''\"effigy of the face of the Lord which is called a Veronica\"''.

Filmed in the [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] sound system, it is the first [[sound film|all-talking]] full-length feature film, released by [[Warner Bros.]], who had introduced the first feature-length film with synchronized sound ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]'' two years earlier. The film, which cost $23,000 to produce ([[Low budget|\"B\" picture]]), grossed over $1,000,000. The enthusiasm with which audiences greeted the talkies was so great that by the end of 1929, Hollywood was producing sound films exclusively.\n\n== Plot ==\nWhen [[Rum-running|bootlegger]]s Jake Jackson (Walter Percival) and Dan Dickson (Jere Delaney), who have been hiding out in a small upstate New York town, learn that they finally can return to New York City, they try to convince a young kid named Eddie Morgan (Cullen Landis) and his friend, a local barber named Gene (Eugene Palette) to come with them.\n\nWith a promise from Jackson and Dickson that they will help the young men establish a barbershop in the city, Eddie asks his mother, Mrs. Morgan (Mary Carr), who owns the town's Morgan Hotel, to loan them $5,000 of her savings. Eddie and Gene set up the barbershop in New York City but soon learn that it is merely a front for a [[speakeasy]].\n\nFrustrated and yearning for a return to the quiet life, Gene and Eddie vow to go home as soon as they earn enough to pay back Mrs. Morgan. Eddie is in love with Kitty Lewis (top-billed Helene Costello), his hometown sweetheart, who preceded him to New York. Now she is a performer at ''The Night Hawk'', a nightclub owned by Hawk Miller (Wheeler Oakman), notorious bootlegger who controls the speakeasy behind the barbershop. Although Hawk's longtime mistress, Molly Thompson (Gladys Brockwell), warns him not to pursue Kitty, he coldly dismisses her, saying that their relationship is over.\n\nAfter a police officer is killed in a bootlegging raid of a supply of Old Century liquor, Hawk tells his henchmen, Sam (Tom Dugan) and Collins (Tom McGuire), that they must find someone to take the blame to keep the police from closing him down. They suggest that Hawk frame Eddie, thereby \"killing two birds with one stone.\" When Eddie comes to the club to visit Kitty, Hawk summons him to his office and asks him to hide his supply of Old Century, saying that it is only temporary, in case the police raid his club. When Detective Crosby (Robert Elliott) comes to the club to question Hawk and implies that he is behind the policeman's murder, Hawk says that the only person he knows who has a supply of Old Century is Eddie.\n\nA short time later, Hawk goes to the barbershop and is killed by an unknown assailant. Fearing that they will be blamed, Eddie and Gene put Hawk's body in a barber chair and rub his face with shaving cream just as Crosby arrives at the shop. After Eddie leaves, a nervous Gene pretends to shave Hawk, but the body slides from the chair, revealing its identity to Crosby. Although Gene swears that the absent Eddie is innocent, Crosby deduces that Eddie has gone to Kitty's apartment and follows him there. Crosby is about to arrest Eddie and Kitty, when Molly arrives and reveals that she killed Hawk because he no longer wanted her. As there was a reward for the killer of the policeman, dead or alive, Crosby tells Molly that things will not go badly for her. Now freed from their obligation to Hawk, Kitty and Eddie take the next train home.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Helene Costello]] as Kitty Lewis\n*[[Cullen Landis]] as Eddie Morgan\n*[[Mary Carr]] as Mrs. Morgan\n*[[Wheeler Oakman]] as 'Hawk' Miller\n*[[Gladys Brockwell]] as Molly Thompson\n*[[Robert Elliott (actor)|Robert Elliott]] as Detective Crosby\n*[[Eugene Pallette]] as Gene\n*Tom Dugan as Sam\n*Tom McGuire as Collins\n*[[Walter Percival]] as Jake Jackson\n*Guy D'Ennery as Tommy\n*Jere Delaney as Dan Dickson\n\n== Songs ==\n*\"At Dawning\" (Sung by Harry Downing)\n*\"Kiss and Make Up\" (Sung by Harry Downing and danced by Chorus Girls in nightclub sequence)\n*\"March Dance\" (Danced by Chorus Girls in nightclub sequence)\n\n== Production ==\nDirected by Foy from a script written by Murray Roth and comedian [[Hugh Herbert]], ''Lights of New York'' was originally intended to be a two-reel film with a budget of $12,000, as the studio had not yet committed to regular production of full-length talking films. However, with studio heads [[Harry Warner|Harry]] and [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]] out of the country to oversee the European premiere of ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', the crew gradually elaborated the plot as the seven-day shooting schedule progressed. Louis Halper, who was in charge of the studio while the Warners were away, eventually wired Jack Warner for the additional money needed to finish the film.<ref name=\"sperling\">{{Cite book\n  | author1=Sperling, Cass Warner  |author2=Millner, Cork\n  | lastauthoramp=yes\n  | title = Hollywood Be Thy Name: The Warner Brothers Story\n  | publisher = University Press of Kentucky\n  | year = 1998\n  | location =\n  | pages = 139\u2013141\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 0-8131-0958-2}}</ref>\n\nUpon discovering that Foy had shot four reels more than promised, Jack Warner ordered him to cut the film back to the original two. Foy later said that the Warners' initial rejection was possibly based on their plans to make the first all-talkie a prestige picture. In an effort to keep the movie off the shelf, Foy screened the picture for an exhibitor friend, who immediately offered to buy it outright for $25,000.

Soon, we are told that anyone who either talks about the temple or even tries to know more about it is killed by a snake bite. And slowly, this fear turns into a legend which keeps everyone away from the temple for almost a year. Elsewhere, Karthik (Nikhil), a medical student who does not believe in super natural powers, falls in love with Valli (Swati); however, she keeps avoiding him every time he tries to get closer to her because of his father's reputation in Village. Meanwhile, Karthik and his friends are asked to go set up a medical camp in Subramaniapuram and Karthik is surprised to see that Valli is also part of the same camp as her Hometown.

Elsewhere, Karthik (Nikhil), a medical student who does not believe in super natural powers, falls in love with Valli (Swati); however, she keeps avoiding him every time he tries to get closer to her because of his father's reputation in Village. Meanwhile, Karthik and his friends are asked to go set up a medical camp in Subramaniapuram and Karthik is surprised to see that Valli is also part of the same camp as her Hometown. Soon, he gets entangled in the ongoing conspiracy surrounding the temple and rest of the story is about how he unravels the secret behind the series of mysterious deaths.\n\n\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Nikhil Siddharth]] as Karthik\n*[[Swati Reddy]] as Valli\n*[[Tanikella Bharani]] as Valli's father\n*[[Rao Ramesh]] as Prudhvi Raj\n*[[Kishore (actor)|Kishore]] as Rajesh\n*[[Jayaprakash]] as Dr. Prakash\n*[[Tulasi (actress)|Tulasi]] as Karthik's mother\n* [[Praveen (Actor)|Praveen]] as Karthik's friend\n*[[Shankar Melkote]] as Principal\n*[[Raja Ravindra]]\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Kumara Bhimarama Temple at Samalkota.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kumararama]] temple at [[Samarlakota]], one of the places where the film was shot.]]\nAfter ''[[Swamy Ra Ra]]'', [[Nikhil Siddharth]] signed his next film directed by his friend Chandoo Mondeti in which he was supposed to play \"a smart, well educated, suave young man studying [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]]\".<ref name=\"October 70\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/building-on-success/article5204370.ece|title=Building on success|publisher=The Hindu|date=5 October 2013|accessdate=28 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028154454/http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/building-on-success/article5204370.ece|archivedate=28 October 2014}}</ref> He also revealed that his character in the film is very curious and a sort of [[Sherlock Holmes]] kind of person.

He appeared as an extra in an episode of the television show ''[[Orlando (TV series)|Orlando]]'', dressed as a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]]. At the age of nine, he was given his first guitar and began a [[skiffle]] band. While at school, he played guitar in \"Susie and the Hula Hoops,\" a trio whose vocalist was a 12-year-old [[Helen Shapiro]]. During lunch breaks at school, he would play his guitar in the playground to a small audience of friends. At 15, he was expelled from school for bad behaviour.<ref name=bramley>{{cite book|last=Bramley|first=John & Shan|title=Marc Bolan: The Legendary Years|year=1992|publisher=Smith Gryphon Publishers|location=London|isbn=1-85685-138-9|pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nBolan briefly joined a modelling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\", appearing in a clothing catalogue for the menswear store. He was a model for the suits in their catalogues as well as for cardboard cut-outs to be displayed in shop windows. ''Town'' magazine featured him as an early example of the mod movement in a photo spread. \n\nIt is suggested that Bolan was in fact bisexual in his life according to those in the music scene. The Who's [[Pete Townshend]] stated in an interview; ''\"I remember Marc Bolan with full make-up on, working as a rent boy to buy clothes, in and around the Scene Club. He was about 15\".''<ref>{{cite website|publisher=Paul Du Noyer|url=https://www.pauldunoyer.com/pop-napoleon-marc-bolan-of-t-rex/|title=Marc Bolan of T. Rex}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, Bolan met his first manager, Geoffrey Delaroy-Hall, and recorded a slick commercial track backed by session musicians called \"All at Once\" (a song very much in the style of his youthful hero, [[Cliff Richard]], the \"English Elvis\"), which was later released posthumously by Danielz and Caron Willans in 2008 as a very limited edition seven-inch vinyl after the original tape recording was passed onto them by Delaroy-Hall. This track is one of Bolan's first professional recordings.\n\nBolan then changed his stage name to Toby Tyler when he met and moved in with child actor [[Allan Warren]], who became his second manager. This encounter afforded Bolan a lifeline to the heart of show business, as Warren saw Bolan's potential while he spent hours sitting cross-legged on Warren's floor playing his acoustic guitar. Bolan at this time liked to appear in [[boho-chic]], wearing a corduroy peaked cap similar to his then current source of inspiration, [[Bob Dylan]]. A series of photographs was commissioned with photographer Michael McGrath, although he recalls that Bolan \"left no impression\" on him at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paytress|first=Mark|title=Bolan: The Rise and Fall of a 20th Century Superstar|year=2006|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=1-84609-147-0}}</ref> Warren also hired a recording studio and had Bolan's first acetates cut. Two tracks were later released, the Bob Dylan song \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" and [[Dion Di Mucci]]'s \"The Road I'm On (Gloria)\". A version of [[Betty Everett]]'s \"You're No Good\" (still unreleased) was later submitted to EMI for a test screening but was turned down.\n\nWarren later sold Bolan's contract and recordings for \u00a3200 to his landlord, property mogul [[David Kirch]], in lieu of three months' back rent, but Kirch was too busy with his property empire to do anything for him. A year or so later, Bolan's mother pushed into Kirch's office and shouted at him that he had done nothing for her son. She demanded he tear up the contract and he willingly complied.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Allan|title=The confessions of a society photographer|year=1976|publisher=Jupiter|location=London|isbn=978-0-904041-68-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Allan|title=Dukes, Queens and Other Stories|year=1999|publisher=New Millennium Books|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Marc Bolan\u2014The Early Years|url=http://members.cox.net/dregenold/marc/early.html|accessdate=6 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811221907/http://members.cox.net/dregenold/marc/early.html|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The tapes of the first two tracks produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished for over 25 years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly $8,000. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available some of the earliest of Bolan's known recordings.\n\nHe signed to [[Decca Records]] in August 1965. At this point his name changed to Marc Bolan via Marc Bowland. There are several accounts of why Bolan was chosen, including that it was derived from [[James Bolam]], a contraction of Bob Dylan, and - according to Bolan himself, that Decca Records chose the name.<ref>{{cite book|title=Marc Bolan: The Rise And Fall Of A 20th Century Superstar  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-yk4U2LILeMC&pg=PT66#v=onepage&q&f=false  | pages=66\u201367  | author=Mark Paytress  |publisher= Omnibus Press| date= 5 Nov 2009  |isbn = 9780857120236}}</ref> He recorded his debut single \"The Wizard\" with [[The Ladybirds]] on backing vocals (later finding fame with [[Benny Hill]]), and studio session musicians playing all the instruments. \"The Wizard\", Bolan's first single, was released on 19 November 1965. It featured [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Big Jim Sullivan]], was produced by Jim Economides, with music director [[Mike Leander]]. Two solo acoustic demos recorded shortly afterwards by the same team (\"Reality\" and \"Song for a Soldier\") have still only been given a limited official release in 2015 on seven-inch vinyl. Both songs are in a folk style reminiscent of Dylan and [[Donovan]]. A third song, \"That's the Bag I'm In,\" written by New York folk singer and Dylan contemporary [[Fred Neil]], was also committed to tape, but has not yet been released. In June 1966, a second official single was also released, with session-musician accompaniment, \"The Third Degree\", backed by \"San Francisco Poet\", Bolan's paean to the [[beat poets]]. Neither song made the charts.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\nIn 1966, Bolan turned up at [[Simon Napier-Bell]]'s front door with his guitar and proclaimed that he was going to be a big star and he needed someone to make all of the arrangements. Napier-Bell invited Bolan in and listened to his songs. A recording session was immediately booked and the songs were very simply recorded (most of them were not actually released until 1974, on the album ''The Beginning of Doves''). Only \"Hippy Gumbo\", a sinister-sounding, baroque folk-song, was released at the time as Bolan's third unsuccessful single. One song, \"You Scare Me to Death,\" was used in a toothpaste advertisement. Some of the songs also resurfaced in 1982, with additional instrumentation added, on the album ''[[You Scare Me to Death]]''. Napier-Bell managed [[The Yardbirds]] and [[John's Children]] and was at first going to slot Bolan into the Yardbirds. In early 1967 he eventually settled instead for John's Children because they needed a songwriter and he admired Bolan's writing ability. The band achieved some success as a live act but sold few records. A John's Children single written by Bolan called \"[[Desdemona (Marc Bolan song)|Desdemona]]\" was banned by the BBC for its line \"lift up your skirt and fly\".\n\nHis tenure with the band was brief. When the band split following an ill-fated German gig with [[The Who]], Bolan took some time to reassess his situation. Bolan's imagination was filled with new ideas and he began to write fantasy novels (''The Krakenmist'' and ''Pictures Of Purple People'') as well as poems and songs, sometimes finding it hard to separate facts from his own elaborate myth - he famously claimed to have spent time with a [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] in Paris who gave him secret knowledge and could levitate. The time spent with him was often alluded to but remained \"mythical\". In reality the wizard was probably American actor Riggs O'Hara with whom Bolan made a trip to Paris in 1965. Given time to reinvent himself, after John's Children, Bolan's songwriting took off and he began writing many of the poetic and neo-romantic songs that would appear on his first albums with [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\n==Tyrannosaurus Rex==\nWhen John's Children collapsed, among other problems, the band's equipment had been repossessed by their label Track Records. But Bolan, unperturbed, rallied to create Tyrannosaurus Rex, his own rock band together with guitarist Ben Cartland, drummer [[Steve Peregrin Took]] and an unknown bass player. Napier-Bell recalled of Bolan: \"He got a gig at the Electric Garden then put an ad in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' to get the musicians. The paper came out on Wednesday, the day of the gig. At three o'clock he was interviewing musicians, at five he was getting ready to go on stage.... It was a disaster. He just got booed off the stage.\"<ref name=\"TR1\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Dave|title=T-Rex\u2014 Up Close And Personal|year=2007}}</ref> Following this concert, Bolan pared the band down to just himself and Took, and they continued as a [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]]-folk rock acoustic duo, playing Bolan's songs, with Took playing assorted hand and kit percussion and occasional bass to Bolan's acoustic guitars and voice. Napier-Bell said of Bolan that after the first disastrous electric gig, \"He didn't have the courage to try it again; it really had been a blow to his ego... Later he told everyone he'd been forced into going acoustic because [[Track Records|Track]] had repossessed all his gear. In fact he'd been forced to go acoustic because he was scared to do anything else.\"<ref name=\"TR1\" />\n\nThe original version of Tyrannosaurus Rex released three albums and four singles, flirting with the charts, reaching as high as number fifteen. They were supported with airplay by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2JYRaGZ8JJIC&pg=PA122 \u201cStand and Deliver: The Autobiography\u201d]. p. 122. Pan Macmillan, 2007</ref> One of the highlights of this era was when the duo played at the first free [[List of concerts in Hyde Park|Hyde Park concert]] in 1968. Although the free-spirited, drug-taking Took was fired from the group after their first American tour, they were a force within the hippie underground scene while they lasted. Their music was filled with Bolan's otherworldly poetry. In 1969, Bolan published his first and only book of poetry entitled ''The Warlock of Love''. Although some critics dismissed it as self-indulgence, it was full of Bolan's florid prose and wordplay, selling 40,000 copies and in 1969-70 became one of Britain's best-selling books of poetry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keatsian.co.uk/keats-and-bolan.htm|title=Bolan and Keats|publisher=Keatsian.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> It was reprinted in 1992 by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.connectedglobe.com/cgi-local/newamazon/cgapf.cgi?Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=0863599206&templates=millennium|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628225345/http://www.connectedglobe.com/cgi-local/newamazon/cgapf.cgi?Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=0863599206&templates=millennium|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 June 2013|title=Reprinted 'The Warlock of Love' by Marc Bolan|publisher=Connectedglobe.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with his early rock and roll interests, Bolan began bringing amplified guitar lines into the duo's music, buying a white [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Stratocaster]] decorated with a [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] teardrop motif. After replacing Took with [[Mickey Finn (musician)|Mickey Finn]], he let the electric influences come forward even further on ''[[A Beard of Stars]]'', the final album to be credited to Tyrannosaurus Rex. It closed with the song \"Elemental Child\", featuring a long electric guitar break influenced by [[Jimi Hendrix]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/> Bolan married his girlfriend, June Ellen Child, on 30 January 1970.<ref>{{cite news |title=My Daddy of Britpop by Marc Bolan's son |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/my-daddy-of-britpop-by-marc-bolans-son-6665946.html |accessdate=2 February 2020 |work=London Evening Standard}}</ref> She was a former secretary to the manager of another of his heroes, [[Syd Barrett]], and June was influential in raising her new husband's profile in the music industry.<ref name=\"TR1\"/> Becoming more adventurous musically, Marc bought a modified vintage [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar (featured on the cover of the album ''[[T.

Stories are conflicting about his inspiration for this\u2014some say it was introduced by his [[personal assistant]], Chelita Secunda, although Bolan told John Pidgeon in a 1974 interview on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] that he noticed the glitter on his wife, June Child's dressing table prior to a photo session and casually daubed some on his face there and then.

The era of [[glam rock|glam]] and glitter rock was born.<ref name=\"Bolan glam\"/>\n[[File:Mark Bolan T-Rex (8716257007).jpg|thumb|upright|An outfit of Marc Bolan on display at the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in Sydney, Australia]]\nThe glam era also saw the rise of Bolan's friend [[David Bowie]], whom Bolan had come to know in the underground days (Bolan had played guitar on Bowie's 1970 single \"Prettiest Star\"; Bolan and Bowie also shared the same manager, Les Conn, and producer, Tony Visconti) but their friendship was also a rivalry, which would continue throughout his career.\n\nBolan followed \"Ride a White Swan\" and ''T. Rex'' by expanding the group to a quartet with bassist [[Steve Currie]] and drummer [[Bill Legend]], and cutting a five-minute single, \"[[Hot Love (Marc Bolan song)|Hot Love]]\", with a rollicking rhythm, string accents and an extended sing-along chorus inspired somewhat by \"[[Hey Jude]]\". It was number one for six weeks and was quickly followed by \"[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On]]\", a grittier, more adult tune that spent four weeks in the top spot. The song was re-titled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" when released in the United States, to avoid confusion with another song with the same title by the American band [[Chase (band)|Chase]]. The song reached No. 10 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in early 1972, the only top 40 single the band had in the US.<ref>Jeremy Simmonds [https://books.google.com/books?id=bMBf3TYZigQC&pg=PA99&dq=get+it+on+t.rex&hl=en&ei=-t4ETejaFMyhOu6WyLIB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=get%20it%20on%20t.rex&f=false The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches (Marc Bolan)] Chicago Review Press, 2008</ref>\n\nIn November 1971, the band's record label, [[Fly Records|Fly]], released the ''[[Electric Warrior]]'' track \"[[Jeepster (song)|Jeepster]]\" without Bolan's permission. Outraged, Bolan took advantage of the timely lapsing of his Fly Records contract and left for [[EMI]], who gave him his own record label, the T. Rex Wax Co. Its bag and label featured an iconic head-and-shoulders image of Bolan. Despite the lack of Bolan's endorsement, \"Jeepster\" peaked at number two in the UK. In 1972, Bolan achieved two more British number ones with \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Metal Guru]]\" (the latter of which stopped [[Elton John]] getting to the top with \"[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]\") and two more number twos in \"[[Children of the Revolution (song)|Children of the Revolution]]\" and \"[[Solid Gold Easy Action]]\".<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>\n\nIn the same year he appeared in [[Ringo Starr]]'s film ''[[Born to Boogie]]'', a documentary showing a concert at Wembley Empire Pool on 18 March 1972. Mixed in were surreal scenes shot at [[John Lennon]]'s mansion in Ascot and a session with T. Rex joined by Ringo Starr on a second drum kit and Elton John on piano. At this time T. Rex record sales accounted for about six percent of total British domestic record sales. The band was reportedly selling 100,000 records a day; however, no T. Rex single ever became a million-seller in the UK, despite many gold discs and an average of four weeks at the top per number one hit.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>\n\nIn 1973, Bolan played twin lead guitar alongside his friend [[Jeff Lynne]] on the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] songs \"[[Ma-Ma-Ma Belle]]\" and \"Dreaming of 4000\" (originally uncredited) from ''[[On the Third Day]]'', as well as on \"Everyone's Born to Die\", which was not released at the time but appears as a bonus track on the 2006 remaster.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>\n\nBy late 1973, his pop star fame gradually began to wane, even though he achieved a number three hit, \"[[20th Century Boy]]\", in February and mid-year \"The Groover\" followed it to number four.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/> \"Truck On (Tyke)\" missed the UK top 10 reaching only No. 12 in December. However, \"[[Teenage Dream (Marc Bolan song)|Teenage Dream]]\" from the 1974 album ''Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow'' showed that Bolan was attempting to create richer, more involved music than he had previously attempted with T. Rex. He expanded the line up of the band to include a second guitarist, Jack Green, and other studio musicians, and began to take more control over the sound and production of his records, including by then girlfriend Gloria Jones on keyboards as well as backing vocals.\n\nEventually, the vintage T. Rex line-up disintegrated. Legend left in 1973 and Finn in 1975 and Bolan's marriage came to an end because of his affair with backing singer Gloria Jones. He spent a good deal of his time in the US during this period, continuing to release singles and albums which, while not reaching major commercial success, were full of unusual lyrics and sometimes eccentric musical experiments. Bolan was not living healthily and began to gain weight, though he subsequently improved and continued working, producing at least one album every year.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\n== Resurgence ==\n[[File:Gloria Jones with son Rolan Bolan 7972.jpg|thumb|Gloria Jones with her and Marc Bolan's son Rolan in 2014]]\nIn September 1975 [[Gloria Jones]] gave birth to Bolan's son, whom they named Rolan Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld'). That same year, Bolan returned to the UK from [[tax exile]] in the US and [[Monaco]] and to the public eye with a low-key tour. Bolan made regular appearances on the LWT pop show ''Supersonic'', directed by his old friend Mike Mansfield and released a succession of singles, but he never regained the success of his glory days of the early 1970s. The last remaining member of Bolan's halcyon era T. Rex, Currie, left the group in late 1976. In early 1977, Bolan got a new band together, released a new album, ''Dandy in the Underworld'', and set out on a fresh UK tour, taking along [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] as support to entice a young audience who did not remember his heyday.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\nLater in 1977, [[Granada Television]] commissioned Bolan to front a six-part series called ''[[Marc (TV series)|Marc]]'' in which he hosted a mix of new and established bands and performed his own songs. By this time Bolan had lost weight, appearing as trim as he had during T. Rex's earlier heyday. The show was broadcast during the post-school half-hour on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] earmarked for children and teenagers and it was a big success. One episode reunited Bolan with his former [[John's Children]]-bandmate [[Andy Ellison]], then fronting the band [[Radio Stars (band)|Radio Stars]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\nBolan's longtime friend and sometimes rival [[David Bowie]] was the final guest on the last episode of ''Marc''. The two performed Bowie's song [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]] near the end of the show, and after Bolan's signoff, they began to play a bluesy song over the closing credits. Right as the vocals were about to begin, however, Bolan stumbled off the stage and out of the camera frame. Bowie's amusement was clearly visible, and the band stopped playing after a few seconds. With no time for a retake, the occurrence was aired.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDxUAWIkiOg&list=RDkDxUAWIkiOg#t=78|title=Mark Bolan falls off stage on 'Marc' Show 6, 1977 via YouTube|accessdate=7 October 2011}}</ref>\nThe another musical guest of note for the final posthumous episode(#1.6 or episode 6) of Marc was Generation X.   Marc Bolan's quote about another artist (SNIFF!) \"Supposed To Be As Pretty As Me\" occurs during that episode while introducing Generation X and directly refers to their lead singer Billy Idol,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3863132/|title=Episode #1.6|website=IMDdb.com|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> who was still the lead singer of Generation X at the time.\n\n== Death ==\n[[File:Marker for the ashes of Mark Feld (Marc Bolan) and his parents, Golders Green Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Marker for the ashes of Mark Feld (Marc Bolan) and his parents, Golders Green Cemetery]]\n[[File:Memorial plaque to Marc Bolan, Golders Green Crematorium.JPG|thumb|Memorial plaque to Marc Bolan, Golders Green Crematorium]]\nOn 16 September 1977, Bolan was riding in a [[Austin Mini#Mini Clubman and 1275GT: 1969\u20131980|Mini 1275GT]] driven by [[Gloria Jones]] as they headed home from Mortons club and restaurant in [[Berkeley Square]].

Also in 1980, [[the Bongos]] were the first American group, with \"Mambo Sun\", to enter the ''Billboard'' charts with a T.Rex cover.

Joe Elliott wanted to sing \"Metal Guru\" while Vivian Campbell wanted \"Telegram Sam\" but end up agreeing to \"20th Century Boy\". It's not the first time that Def Leppard has sung a T.Rex song; there is a live version of Get It On. \"Children of the Revolution\" was similarly performed by [[Elton John]] and [[Pete Doherty]] of [[The Libertines]] at [[Live 8]], 20 years later. [[U2]]'s [[Bono]] and [[Gavin Friday]] also covered \"Children of the Revolution\" on the ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' soundtrack.\n\n\"20th Century Boy\" introduced a new generation of devotees to Bolan's work in 1991 when it was featured on a [[Levi Strauss|Levi]]'s jeans TV commercial featuring [[Brad Pitt]], and was re-released, reaching the UK Top 20. The song was performed by the fictional band The Flaming Creatures (performed by [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], reprised by Placebo and David Bowie at the 1999 [[BRIT Awards]]) in the 1998 film ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]''. In every decade since his death, a Bolan greatest hits compilation has placed in the top 20 UK albums and periodic boosts in sales have come via cover versions from artists inspired by Bolan, including [[Morrissey]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. Similarly, \"I Love to Boogie\" was briefly used on an advert for Robinson's soft drink in 2001, bringing Bolan's music to a new generation. [[Mitsubishi]] also featured \"20th Century Boy\" in a 2002 car commercial, prompting Hip-O Records to release a best-of collection CD titled ''20th Century Boy: The Ultimate Collection''.\n\nHis music is still widely used in films, recent notable cases being ''[[Breakfast on Pluto]]'', ''[[Death Proof]]'', ''[[Lords of Dogtown]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot]]'', ''[[Jarhead (film)|Jarhead]]'', ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'', ''Breaking-Up'', ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'', ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'', ''[[School of Rock]]'' , ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World]]'' and ''[[Dallas Buyers Club]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Wonderland (2003)|url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0335563/|accessdate=2016-11-30}}</ref> Bolan is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence ([[Joy Division]]/[[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s [[Bernard Sumner]] has said that the first single he owned was \"Ride a White Swan\".) However, he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music. The tunes were never as important as the words.\n\nBolan had arranged a discretionary [[trust law|trust]] to safeguard his money. A small, separate [[Jersey]]-based trust fund has allowed his son to receive some income. However, the bulk of Bolan's fortune, variously estimated at between \u00a320 and \u00a330&nbsp;million (approx $38&nbsp;\u2013 $57&nbsp;million), remains in trust. As of 2007, Bolan's family is supposed to have a house paid for by the trust, and Rolan is supposed to receive an allowance.\n\nThere are two plaques dedicated to his memory at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] in [[North London]]. The first was placed there in the mid-1990s in white marble and was installed by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society with the help of fans worldwide. The second was installed by the official Marc Bolan fan club and fellow fans in September 2002, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his passing. The inscription on the stone, which also bears his image, reads '25 years on&nbsp;\u2013 his light of love still shines brightly'. Placed beneath the plaque there is an appropriate ceramic figure of a white swan.\n\nIn 2006, TV series ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]'', William Matheson portrays Marc Bolan, circa 1973, in a bar in [[Manchester]]. Time-travelling [[Sam Tyler]] recognises him, has a fan boy moment, and warns him to be careful of riding in Minis. In the [[Life on Mars (U.S. TV series)|American version of the series]], the character is replaced by that of [[Jim Croce]], who died later that year in a plane crash, and Sam warns him. However, the T.

He appeared as an extra in an episode of the television show ''[[Orlando (TV series)|Orlando]]'', dressed as a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]]. At the age of nine, he was given his first guitar and began a [[skiffle]] band. While at school, he played guitar in \"Susie and the Hula Hoops,\" a trio whose vocalist was a 12-year-old [[Helen Shapiro]]. During lunch breaks at school, he would play his guitar in the playground to a small audience of friends. At 15, he was expelled from school for bad behaviour.<ref name=bramley>{{cite book|last=Bramley|first=John & Shan|title=Marc Bolan: The Legendary Years|year=1992|publisher=Smith Gryphon Publishers|location=London|isbn=1-85685-138-9|pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nBolan briefly joined a modelling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\", appearing in a clothing catalogue for the menswear store. He was a model for the suits in their catalogues as well as for cardboard cut-outs to be displayed in shop windows. ''Town'' magazine featured him as an early example of the mod movement in a photo spread. \n\nIt is suggested that Bolan was in fact bisexual in his life according to those in the music scene. The Who's [[Pete Townshend]] stated in an interview; ''\"I remember Marc Bolan with full make-up on, working as a rent boy to buy clothes, in and around the Scene Club. He was about 15\".''<ref>{{cite website|publisher=Paul Du Noyer|url=https://www.pauldunoyer.com/pop-napoleon-marc-bolan-of-t-rex/|title=Marc Bolan of T. Rex}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, Bolan met his first manager, Geoffrey Delaroy-Hall, and recorded a slick commercial track backed by session musicians called \"All at Once\" (a song very much in the style of his youthful hero, [[Cliff Richard]], the \"English Elvis\"), which was later released posthumously by Danielz and Caron Willans in 2008 as a very limited edition seven-inch vinyl after the original tape recording was passed onto them by Delaroy-Hall. This track is one of Bolan's first professional recordings.\n\nBolan then changed his stage name to Toby Tyler when he met and moved in with child actor [[Allan Warren]], who became his second manager. This encounter afforded Bolan a lifeline to the heart of show business, as Warren saw Bolan's potential while he spent hours sitting cross-legged on Warren's floor playing his acoustic guitar. Bolan at this time liked to appear in [[boho-chic]], wearing a corduroy peaked cap similar to his then current source of inspiration, [[Bob Dylan]]. A series of photographs was commissioned with photographer Michael McGrath, although he recalls that Bolan \"left no impression\" on him at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paytress|first=Mark|title=Bolan: The Rise and Fall of a 20th Century Superstar|year=2006|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=1-84609-147-0}}</ref> Warren also hired a recording studio and had Bolan's first acetates cut. Two tracks were later released, the Bob Dylan song \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" and [[Dion Di Mucci]]'s \"The Road I'm On (Gloria)\". A version of [[Betty Everett]]'s \"You're No Good\" (still unreleased) was later submitted to EMI for a test screening but was turned down.\n\nWarren later sold Bolan's contract and recordings for \u00a3200 to his landlord, property mogul [[David Kirch]], in lieu of three months' back rent, but Kirch was too busy with his property empire to do anything for him. A year or so later, Bolan's mother pushed into Kirch's office and shouted at him that he had done nothing for her son. She demanded he tear up the contract and he willingly complied.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Allan|title=The confessions of a society photographer|year=1976|publisher=Jupiter|location=London|isbn=978-0-904041-68-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Allan|title=Dukes, Queens and Other Stories|year=1999|publisher=New Millennium Books|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Marc Bolan\u2014The Early Years|url=http://members.cox.net/dregenold/marc/early.html|accessdate=6 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811221907/http://members.cox.net/dregenold/marc/early.html|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The tapes of the first two tracks produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished for over 25 years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly $8,000. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available some of the earliest of Bolan's known recordings.\n\nHe signed to [[Decca Records]] in August 1965. At this point his name changed to Marc Bolan via Marc Bowland. There are several accounts of why Bolan was chosen, including that it was derived from [[James Bolam]], a contraction of Bob Dylan, and - according to Bolan himself, that Decca Records chose the name.<ref>{{cite book|title=Marc Bolan: The Rise And Fall Of A 20th Century Superstar  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-yk4U2LILeMC&pg=PT66#v=onepage&q&f=false  | pages=66\u201367  | author=Mark Paytress  |publisher= Omnibus Press| date= 5 Nov 2009  |isbn = 9780857120236}}</ref> He recorded his debut single \"The Wizard\" with [[The Ladybirds]] on backing vocals (later finding fame with [[Benny Hill]]), and studio session musicians playing all the instruments. \"The Wizard\", Bolan's first single, was released on 19 November 1965. It featured [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Big Jim Sullivan]], was produced by Jim Economides, with music director [[Mike Leander]]. Two solo acoustic demos recorded shortly afterwards by the same team (\"Reality\" and \"Song for a Soldier\") have still only been given a limited official release in 2015 on seven-inch vinyl. Both songs are in a folk style reminiscent of Dylan and [[Donovan]]. A third song, \"That's the Bag I'm In,\" written by New York folk singer and Dylan contemporary [[Fred Neil]], was also committed to tape, but has not yet been released. In June 1966, a second official single was also released, with session-musician accompaniment, \"The Third Degree\", backed by \"San Francisco Poet\", Bolan's paean to the [[beat poets]]. Neither song made the charts.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\nIn 1966, Bolan turned up at [[Simon Napier-Bell]]'s front door with his guitar and proclaimed that he was going to be a big star and he needed someone to make all of the arrangements. Napier-Bell invited Bolan in and listened to his songs. A recording session was immediately booked and the songs were very simply recorded (most of them were not actually released until 1974, on the album ''The Beginning of Doves''). Only \"Hippy Gumbo\", a sinister-sounding, baroque folk-song, was released at the time as Bolan's third unsuccessful single. One song, \"You Scare Me to Death,\" was used in a toothpaste advertisement. Some of the songs also resurfaced in 1982, with additional instrumentation added, on the album ''[[You Scare Me to Death]]''. Napier-Bell managed [[The Yardbirds]] and [[John's Children]] and was at first going to slot Bolan into the Yardbirds. In early 1967 he eventually settled instead for John's Children because they needed a songwriter and he admired Bolan's writing ability. The band achieved some success as a live act but sold few records. A John's Children single written by Bolan called \"[[Desdemona (Marc Bolan song)|Desdemona]]\" was banned by the BBC for its line \"lift up your skirt and fly\".\n\nHis tenure with the band was brief. When the band split following an ill-fated German gig with [[The Who]], Bolan took some time to reassess his situation. Bolan's imagination was filled with new ideas and he began to write fantasy novels (''The Krakenmist'' and ''Pictures Of Purple People'') as well as poems and songs, sometimes finding it hard to separate facts from his own elaborate myth - he famously claimed to have spent time with a [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] in Paris who gave him secret knowledge and could levitate. The time spent with him was often alluded to but remained \"mythical\". In reality the wizard was probably American actor Riggs O'Hara with whom Bolan made a trip to Paris in 1965. Given time to reinvent himself, after John's Children, Bolan's songwriting took off and he began writing many of the poetic and neo-romantic songs that would appear on his first albums with [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\n==Tyrannosaurus Rex==\nWhen John's Children collapsed, among other problems, the band's equipment had been repossessed by their label Track Records. But Bolan, unperturbed, rallied to create Tyrannosaurus Rex, his own rock band together with guitarist Ben Cartland, drummer [[Steve Peregrin Took]] and an unknown bass player. Napier-Bell recalled of Bolan: \"He got a gig at the Electric Garden then put an ad in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' to get the musicians. The paper came out on Wednesday, the day of the gig. At three o'clock he was interviewing musicians, at five he was getting ready to go on stage.... It was a disaster. He just got booed off the stage.\"<ref name=\"TR1\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Dave|title=T-Rex\u2014 Up Close And Personal|year=2007}}</ref> Following this concert, Bolan pared the band down to just himself and Took, and they continued as a [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]]-folk rock acoustic duo, playing Bolan's songs, with Took playing assorted hand and kit percussion and occasional bass to Bolan's acoustic guitars and voice. Napier-Bell said of Bolan that after the first disastrous electric gig, \"He didn't have the courage to try it again; it really had been a blow to his ego... Later he told everyone he'd been forced into going acoustic because [[Track Records|Track]] had repossessed all his gear. In fact he'd been forced to go acoustic because he was scared to do anything else.\"<ref name=\"TR1\" />\n\nThe original version of Tyrannosaurus Rex released three albums and four singles, flirting with the charts, reaching as high as number fifteen. They were supported with airplay by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2JYRaGZ8JJIC&pg=PA122 \u201cStand and Deliver: The Autobiography\u201d]. p. 122. Pan Macmillan, 2007</ref> One of the highlights of this era was when the duo played at the first free [[List of concerts in Hyde Park|Hyde Park concert]] in 1968. Although the free-spirited, drug-taking Took was fired from the group after their first American tour, they were a force within the hippie underground scene while they lasted. Their music was filled with Bolan's otherworldly poetry. In 1969, Bolan published his first and only book of poetry entitled ''The Warlock of Love''. Although some critics dismissed it as self-indulgence, it was full of Bolan's florid prose and wordplay, selling 40,000 copies and in 1969-70 became one of Britain's best-selling books of poetry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keatsian.co.uk/keats-and-bolan.htm|title=Bolan and Keats|publisher=Keatsian.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> It was reprinted in 1992 by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.connectedglobe.com/cgi-local/newamazon/cgapf.cgi?Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=0863599206&templates=millennium|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628225345/http://www.connectedglobe.com/cgi-local/newamazon/cgapf.cgi?Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=0863599206&templates=millennium|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 June 2013|title=Reprinted 'The Warlock of Love' by Marc Bolan|publisher=Connectedglobe.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with his early rock and roll interests, Bolan began bringing amplified guitar lines into the duo's music, buying a white [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Stratocaster]] decorated with a [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] teardrop motif. After replacing Took with [[Mickey Finn (musician)|Mickey Finn]], he let the electric influences come forward even further on ''[[A Beard of Stars]]'', the final album to be credited to Tyrannosaurus Rex. It closed with the song \"Elemental Child\", featuring a long electric guitar break influenced by [[Jimi Hendrix]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/> Bolan married his girlfriend, June Ellen Child, on 30 January 1970.<ref>{{cite news |title=My Daddy of Britpop by Marc Bolan's son |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/my-daddy-of-britpop-by-marc-bolans-son-6665946.html |accessdate=2 February 2020 |work=London Evening Standard}}</ref> She was a former secretary to the manager of another of his heroes, [[Syd Barrett]], and June was influential in raising her new husband's profile in the music industry.<ref name=\"TR1\"/> Becoming more adventurous musically, Marc bought a modified vintage [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar (featured on the cover of the album ''[[T.

Stories are conflicting about his inspiration for this\u2014some say it was introduced by his [[personal assistant]], Chelita Secunda, although Bolan told John Pidgeon in a 1974 interview on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] that he noticed the glitter on his wife, June Child's dressing table prior to a photo session and casually daubed some on his face there and then. Other performers\u2014and their fans\u2014soon took up variations on the idea.

Rex'' by expanding the group to a quartet with bassist [[Steve Currie]] and drummer [[Bill Legend]], and cutting a five-minute single, \"[[Hot Love (Marc Bolan song)|Hot Love]]\", with a rollicking rhythm, string accents and an extended sing-along chorus inspired somewhat by \"[[Hey Jude]]\". It was number one for six weeks and was quickly followed by \"[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On]]\", a grittier, more adult tune that spent four weeks in the top spot. The song was re-titled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" when released in the United States, to avoid confusion with another song with the same title by the American band [[Chase (band)|Chase]]. The song reached No. 10 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in early 1972, the only top 40 single the band had in the US.<ref>Jeremy Simmonds [https://books.google.com/books?id=bMBf3TYZigQC&pg=PA99&dq=get+it+on+t.rex&hl=en&ei=-t4ETejaFMyhOu6WyLIB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=get%20it%20on%20t.rex&f=false The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches (Marc Bolan)] Chicago Review Press, 2008</ref>\n\nIn November 1971, the band's record label, [[Fly Records|Fly]], released the ''[[Electric Warrior]]'' track \"[[Jeepster (song)|Jeepster]]\" without Bolan's permission. Outraged, Bolan took advantage of the timely lapsing of his Fly Records contract and left for [[EMI]], who gave him his own record label, the T. Rex Wax Co. Its bag and label featured an iconic head-and-shoulders image of Bolan. Despite the lack of Bolan's endorsement, \"Jeepster\" peaked at number two in the UK. In 1972, Bolan achieved two more British number ones with \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Metal Guru]]\" (the latter of which stopped [[Elton John]] getting to the top with \"[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]\") and two more number twos in \"[[Children of the Revolution (song)|Children of the Revolution]]\" and \"[[Solid Gold Easy Action]]\".<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>\n\nIn the same year he appeared in [[Ringo Starr]]'s film ''[[Born to Boogie]]'', a documentary showing a concert at Wembley Empire Pool on 18 March 1972. Mixed in were surreal scenes shot at [[John Lennon]]'s mansion in Ascot and a session with T. Rex joined by Ringo Starr on a second drum kit and Elton John on piano. At this time T. Rex record sales accounted for about six percent of total British domestic record sales. The band was reportedly selling 100,000 records a day; however, no T. Rex single ever became a million-seller in the UK, despite many gold discs and an average of four weeks at the top per number one hit.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>\n\nIn 1973, Bolan played twin lead guitar alongside his friend [[Jeff Lynne]] on the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] songs \"[[Ma-Ma-Ma Belle]]\" and \"Dreaming of 4000\" (originally uncredited) from ''[[On the Third Day]]'', as well as on \"Everyone's Born to Die\", which was not released at the time but appears as a bonus track on the 2006 remaster.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>\n\nBy late 1973, his pop star fame gradually began to wane, even though he achieved a number three hit, \"[[20th Century Boy]]\", in February and mid-year \"The Groover\" followed it to number four.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/> \"Truck On (Tyke)\" missed the UK top 10 reaching only No. 12 in December. However, \"[[Teenage Dream (Marc Bolan song)|Teenage Dream]]\" from the 1974 album ''Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow'' showed that Bolan was attempting to create richer, more involved music than he had previously attempted with T. Rex. He expanded the line up of the band to include a second guitarist, Jack Green, and other studio musicians, and began to take more control over the sound and production of his records, including by then girlfriend Gloria Jones on keyboards as well as backing vocals.\n\nEventually, the vintage T. Rex line-up disintegrated. Legend left in 1973 and Finn in 1975 and Bolan's marriage came to an end because of his affair with backing singer Gloria Jones. He spent a good deal of his time in the US during this period, continuing to release singles and albums which, while not reaching major commercial success, were full of unusual lyrics and sometimes eccentric musical experiments. Bolan was not living healthily and began to gain weight, though he subsequently improved and continued working, producing at least one album every year.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\n== Resurgence ==\n[[File:Gloria Jones with son Rolan Bolan 7972.jpg|thumb|Gloria Jones with her and Marc Bolan's son Rolan in 2014]]\nIn September 1975 [[Gloria Jones]] gave birth to Bolan's son, whom they named Rolan Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld'). That same year, Bolan returned to the UK from [[tax exile]] in the US and [[Monaco]] and to the public eye with a low-key tour. Bolan made regular appearances on the LWT pop show ''Supersonic'', directed by his old friend Mike Mansfield and released a succession of singles, but he never regained the success of his glory days of the early 1970s. The last remaining member of Bolan's halcyon era T. Rex, Currie, left the group in late 1976. In early 1977, Bolan got a new band together, released a new album, ''Dandy in the Underworld'', and set out on a fresh UK tour, taking along [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] as support to entice a young audience who did not remember his heyday.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\nLater in 1977, [[Granada Television]] commissioned Bolan to front a six-part series called ''[[Marc (TV series)|Marc]]'' in which he hosted a mix of new and established bands and performed his own songs. By this time Bolan had lost weight, appearing as trim as he had during T. Rex's earlier heyday. The show was broadcast during the post-school half-hour on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] earmarked for children and teenagers and it was a big success. One episode reunited Bolan with his former [[John's Children]]-bandmate [[Andy Ellison]], then fronting the band [[Radio Stars (band)|Radio Stars]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/>\n\nBolan's longtime friend and sometimes rival [[David Bowie]] was the final guest on the last episode of ''Marc''. The two performed Bowie's song [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]] near the end of the show, and after Bolan's signoff, they began to play a bluesy song over the closing credits. Right as the vocals were about to begin, however, Bolan stumbled off the stage and out of the camera frame. Bowie's amusement was clearly visible, and the band stopped playing after a few seconds. With no time for a retake, the occurrence was aired.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDxUAWIkiOg&list=RDkDxUAWIkiOg#t=78|title=Mark Bolan falls off stage on 'Marc' Show 6, 1977 via YouTube|accessdate=7 October 2011}}</ref>\nThe another musical guest of note for the final posthumous episode(#1.6 or episode 6) of Marc was Generation X.   Marc Bolan's quote about another artist (SNIFF!) \"Supposed To Be As Pretty As Me\" occurs during that episode while introducing Generation X and directly refers to their lead singer Billy Idol,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3863132/|title=Episode #1.6|website=IMDdb.com|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> who was still the lead singer of Generation X at the time.\n\n== Death ==\n[[File:Marker for the ashes of Mark Feld (Marc Bolan) and his parents, Golders Green Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Marker for the ashes of Mark Feld (Marc Bolan) and his parents, Golders Green Cemetery]]\n[[File:Memorial plaque to Marc Bolan, Golders Green Crematorium.JPG|thumb|Memorial plaque to Marc Bolan, Golders Green Crematorium]]\nOn 16 September 1977, Bolan was riding in a [[Austin Mini#Mini Clubman and 1275GT: 1969\u20131980|Mini 1275GT]] driven by [[Gloria Jones]] as they headed home from Mortons club and restaurant in [[Berkeley Square]].

Also in 1980, [[the Bongos]] were the first American group, with \"Mambo Sun\", to enter the ''Billboard'' charts with a T.Rex cover.

(Def Leppard album)|Yeah!]]'', which contains covers of their favourite bands while growing up, the first song on this album is \"20th Century Boy\". Joe Elliott wanted to sing \"Metal Guru\" while Vivian Campbell wanted \"Telegram Sam\" but end up agreeing to \"20th Century Boy\". It's not the first time that Def Leppard has sung a T.Rex song; there is a live version of Get It On. \"Children of the Revolution\" was similarly performed by [[Elton John]] and [[Pete Doherty]] of [[The Libertines]] at [[Live 8]], 20 years later. [[U2]]'s [[Bono]] and [[Gavin Friday]] also covered \"Children of the Revolution\" on the ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' soundtrack.\n\n\"20th Century Boy\" introduced a new generation of devotees to Bolan's work in 1991 when it was featured on a [[Levi Strauss|Levi]]'s jeans TV commercial featuring [[Brad Pitt]], and was re-released, reaching the UK Top 20. The song was performed by the fictional band The Flaming Creatures (performed by [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], reprised by Placebo and David Bowie at the 1999 [[BRIT Awards]]) in the 1998 film ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]''. In every decade since his death, a Bolan greatest hits compilation has placed in the top 20 UK albums and periodic boosts in sales have come via cover versions from artists inspired by Bolan, including [[Morrissey]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. Similarly, \"I Love to Boogie\" was briefly used on an advert for Robinson's soft drink in 2001, bringing Bolan's music to a new generation. [[Mitsubishi]] also featured \"20th Century Boy\" in a 2002 car commercial, prompting Hip-O Records to release a best-of collection CD titled ''20th Century Boy: The Ultimate Collection''.\n\nHis music is still widely used in films, recent notable cases being ''[[Breakfast on Pluto]]'', ''[[Death Proof]]'', ''[[Lords of Dogtown]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot]]'', ''[[Jarhead (film)|Jarhead]]'', ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'', ''Breaking-Up'', ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'', ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'', ''[[School of Rock]]'' , ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World]]'' and ''[[Dallas Buyers Club]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Wonderland (2003)|url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0335563/|accessdate=2016-11-30}}</ref> Bolan is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence ([[Joy Division]]/[[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s [[Bernard Sumner]] has said that the first single he owned was \"Ride a White Swan\".) However, he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music. The tunes were never as important as the words.\n\nBolan had arranged a discretionary [[trust law|trust]] to safeguard his money. A small, separate [[Jersey]]-based trust fund has allowed his son to receive some income. However, the bulk of Bolan's fortune, variously estimated at between \u00a320 and \u00a330&nbsp;million (approx $38&nbsp;\u2013 $57&nbsp;million), remains in trust. As of 2007, Bolan's family is supposed to have a house paid for by the trust, and Rolan is supposed to receive an allowance.\n\nThere are two plaques dedicated to his memory at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] in [[North London]]. The first was placed there in the mid-1990s in white marble and was installed by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society with the help of fans worldwide. The second was installed by the official Marc Bolan fan club and fellow fans in September 2002, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his passing. The inscription on the stone, which also bears his image, reads '25 years on&nbsp;\u2013 his light of love still shines brightly'. Placed beneath the plaque there is an appropriate ceramic figure of a white swan.\n\nIn 2006, TV series ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]'', William Matheson portrays Marc Bolan, circa 1973, in a bar in [[Manchester]]. Time-travelling [[Sam Tyler]] recognises him, has a fan boy moment, and warns him to be careful of riding in Minis. In the [[Life on Mars (U.S. TV series)|American version of the series]], the character is replaced by that of [[Jim Croce]], who died later that year in a plane crash, and Sam warns him. However, the T. Rex version of \"Get It On\" is played in the New York dance club in that scene.\n\nIn 2007, the [[English Tourist Board]] included [[Bolan's Rock Shrine]] in their guide to Important Sites of Rock 'n Roll interest 'England Rocks'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/740087/Rockin-all-over-England.html|title=Rockin' all over England|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> As reported in 2011, a school is planned in his honour, to be built in Sierra Leone: The Marc Bolan School of Music and Film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/58393|title=Marc Bolan School of Music opens in Sierra Leone|date=2 August 2011|website=Nme.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> A musical, ''20th Century Boy'', based on Bolan's life, and featuring his music, premiered at the [[New Wolsey Theatre]] in [[Ipswich]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/southeast/E8831306252498/A+Show+About+Bolan+in+Ipswich.html |title=A Show About Bolan in Ipswich |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=31 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020124308/http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/southeast/E8831306252498/A+Show+About+Bolan+in+Ipswich.html |archive-date=20 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\nSee [[T.

{"title_page": "Surrogate model", "text_new": "A '''surrogate model''' is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest cannot be easily directly measured,{{disputed inline|Used when outcome cannot be directly measured?|date=January 2020}} so a model of the outcome is used instead. Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as a function of design variables.  For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the airflow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..).  For many real-world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete.  As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and ''what-if'' analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.\n\nOne way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models, known as '''surrogate models''', [[Response surface methodology|response surface models]], ''metamodels'' or ''emulators'', that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven, bottom-up approach. The exact, inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known (or even understood), solely the input-output behavior is important. A model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points. This approach is also known as behavioral modeling or black-box modeling, though the terminology is not always consistent.  When only a single design variable is involved, the process is known as [[curve fitting]].\n\nThough using surrogate models in lieu of experiments and simulations in engineering design is more common, surrogate modeling may be used in many other areas of science where there are expensive experiments and/or function evaluations.\n\n==Goals==\n\nThe scientific challenge of surrogate modeling is the generation of a surrogate that is as accurate as possible, using as few simulation evaluations as possible. The process comprises three major steps which may be interleaved iteratively:\n\n* Sample selection (also known as sequential design, optimal experimental design (OED) or active learning)\n* Construction of the surrogate model and optimizing the model parameters (bias-variance trade-off)\n* Appraisal of the accuracy of the surrogate.\n\nThe accuracy of the surrogate depends on the number and location of samples (expensive experiments or simulations) in the design space. Various [[design of experiments]] (DOE) techniques cater to different sources of errors, in particular, errors due to noise in the data or errors due to an improper surrogate model.\n\n==Types of surrogate models==\n\nPopular surrogate modeling approaches are: polynomial [[response surface]]s; [[kriging]]; [[gradient-enhanced kriging]] (GEK); [[radial basis function]]; [[support vector machine]]s; [[space mapping]] <ref name=\"space mapping\">J.W.
