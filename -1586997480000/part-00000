It is found in rocky escarpments in the [[Kimberley region of Western Australia|Kimberley]], [[Arnhem Land]] and [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] across [[Western Australia]] and [[Northern Territory]] and just passing the [[Queensland]] border. It is also found on [[Groote Eylandt]].<ref name = Menkhorst>{{cite book | last = Menkhorst | first = Peter | year = 2001 | title = A Field Guide to the Mammals of Australia | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 96}}</ref> It the only species in the genus '''''Petropseudes''''', but is part of the group including the [[common ringtail possum]] (''Pseudocheirus peregrinus'').<ref name = MSW3/>\n\nThe rock-haunting ringtail possum has one of the shortest tails of all [[ringtail possum]]s, and at its end it is hairless and scaly. It lives in small groups and is mainly [[herbivorous]]. It has a stocky build and is mostly grey in colour.<ref name=Menkhorst/>\n\nThe Kunwinjku of Western Arnhem Land hunted '''Ngingma''', as they call this possum by placing sugar bag (bush honey) on a rock.  Attracted to the bait the animal was then speared.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fauna of Kakadu and the Top End| last=Goodfellow| first=D.| year=1993| isbn=1862543062|publisher=Wakefield Press | page= 25}}</ref> Bininj Kunwok record another name for this species, '''Djorrkun''' <ref>{{cite book|title=Bininj Kunwok| last=National Environmental Research Program, http://pad.katalyst.com.au/plant_or_animals/rock-ringtail-possum| first=.| year= 2019| isbn=|publisher= Australian Government | page= }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe rock-haunting ringtail possum is almost the size of a small [[rabbit]]. It is grey to reddish-grey in colour on the back, while its underside is a light cream colour. It has white hair patches underneath its small, round ears and both above and below the eyes.<ref name=ADW>[http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Petropseudes_dahli.html ADW: Petropseudes dahli: Information]</ref> A mid-dorsal stripe runs from the crown of the head to the middle of the back. Like other possums, it has a [[Prehensility|prehensile]] tail, adapted for grasping especially by wrapping around. However, the tail is unique in its appearance compared to that of other possums as it is covered with fur only halfway down. Males are 33.4 to 37.5&nbsp;cm long while females are generally bigger and range from 34.9 to 38.3&nbsp;cm in length and weigh between 1,280 and 2,000&nbsp;grams. Another uncommon feature in the appearance of this species is that it has [[Pupil#Non-human animals|vertical pupils]].<ref name=Kerle>{{cite book |author1=Collett |author2=Kerle, J.A. |author3=Winter, J.W. |editor = Strahan, R.| year=1995 |title=The Mammals of Australia |edition=2nd |publisher=New Holland Publishers Pty Ltd.|location=Carlton, VIC}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\nThe rock-haunting ringtail possum disperses seeds through its fruit eating habits. It also influences termite populations and acts as prey for regional predators. The rock-haunting ringtail possum has been affected by human induced habitat fragmentation and hence, its numbers have decreased significantly. The species is listed as a priority species in Western Australia.<ref name=McKay />\n\n===Habitat===\nThe rock-haunting ringtail possum lives exclusively in rocky outcrops and prefers areas with large boulders and deeply fissured rock. It uses the crevices to hide by just sticking its head into the crevice with the body exposed. It is strictly [[nocturnal]]; it only moves out of it sheltered rock crevices to climbing trees to feed at night. It does not make a nest and has been observed occasionally to be sleeping in well protected rock ledges during the day. This suggests a high level of adaptation to a terrestrial existence. Indicators of a reduction in arboreal adaptation are shorter legs, shorter claws, shorter tail and a slightly longer snout.<ref name = Kerle />\n\n===Diet===\nThe rock-haunting ringtail possum eats [[fruit]]s, [[flower]]s and [[leaves]] of a variety of trees found near its habitat and occasionally feeds on [[termite]]s. It usually stays close to the rocks while feeding but has been found as far as 100m from the nearest outcrop. Most common of the blossoms it eats are of Darwin Woollybutt (''[[Eucalyptus miniata]]'') and Darwin Stringybark (''[[Eucalyptus tetrodonta]]''). Its major fruit intake is from ''[[Zyziphus oenoplia]]'', ''[[Vitex glabrata]]'', Billy Goat Plum (''[[Terminalia ferdinandiana]]''), and ''[[Owenia vernicosa]]''. Leaves eaten include ''[[Flagelleria indica]]'', ''[[Pouteria sericea]]'' and [[Vine Reedcane]].<ref name = Kerle />\n\n===Known predators===\nSome known predators of the rock-haunting ringtail possum are the [[Dingo]] (''Canis lupus dingo''), the [[oenpelli python|Oenpelli Python]] (''Morelia oenpelliensis''), the [[olive python|Olive Python]] (''Liasis olivaceous''), [[quoll]]s (''Dasyurus'' spp.), [[owl]]s (Strigiformes), [[feral cats]] (''Felis catus''), [[domestic dogs]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') and [[human]]s (''Homo sapiens'').<ref name=ADW /> The rock-haunting ringtail possum spends a large amount of time participating in sentinel behaviour to avoid predators. It perches on branches or ledges and scans the area for danger. In an attempt to deter predators and to warn others, this possum beats its tail against tree branches vigorously causing the entire tree to shake.<ref name = Runcie />\n\n==Lifestyle==\nOf all the Australian possums, the rock-haunting ringtail possum lives in the most tightly knit family groups. Adults and their young will stay within 2\u20133 metres of each other throughout the night.<ref name=Kerle /> The family groups are generally made up of about 4 individuals, although group sizes of 2 to 10 individuals have been reported. The possum spends most of its time sheltered within rock piles or crevices.<ref name=Runcie /> After dark it moves from its rocky home into the nearby trees where it feeds. This possum is secretive, difficult to trap and avoids contact and confrontation as far as possible. It is primarily [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], moving into the trees only to feed. This distinguishes it from its close, mostly [[arboreal]] relatives.<ref name=McKay>{{cite journal |author=McKay, G.M.|editor1=Walton, D.W. |editor2=Richardson, B.J. |year=1989 |title=Family Petauridae|journal=Fauna of Australia|volume=1B|pages=665\u2013678|publisher=Australian Government Publishing|location=Canberra}}</ref> Its eye-shine is very bright in a spotlight but unlike most possums, it doesn't freeze when caught in a bean of light. Instead, it retreats to its rock shelter or crevices where it hides with its head in the crevice but its body exposed.<ref name=Kerle />\n\n===Reproduction===\nThere appears to be no particular season for breeding. However, females with a large young in the pouch and a young on the back have been seen in March, July, August and September. Although the [[gestation]] period information is not available for the species, it is known that close relatives have gestation periods from 16 to 30 days. The new offspring spends its first five weeks in the female's large pouch which has two teats. The parents usually carry the new offspring on their back after they have left the mother's pouch. Caring for the young is divided nearly equally among the parents. The parents are assisted in raising the offspring by the previous offspring who commonly stay with the family unit.<ref name = Kerle /> The parents practice protective behaviours such as spend time watching for predators, tail beating, and vocalizing and marshaling the young to keep them relatively close.<ref name=Runcie>{{cite journal |last=Runcie |first=M.J. |year=1999 |title=Biparental care and obligate monogamy in the rock-haunting possum, Petropseudes dahli, from tropical Australia |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=59 |issue=5|pages=1001\u20131008 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1392 |pmid=10860527}}</ref>\n\n===Home range and obligate monogamy===\nBoth sexes have about the same home range size. Average home range is 0.9 hectares, with home ranges ranging in size from 0.5 to 1.2 hectares. The average density in these home ranges is 0.4 possums per hectare.<ref name = Kerle /> Females live with one male in their home range, which are commonly marked by scent posts. To scent-mark, the rock-haunting ringtail possum rubs or presses their cloacal-caudal region or chest against the surface. While the possum also marked rock ledges and trees within its home ranges, scent marking was most vigorous around den sites.<ref name = Runcie />\n\nThe rock-haunting ringtail possum is one of few obligate [[monogamous]] marsupial species. A consistent characteristic of obligate monogamy displayed by this species is the existence of cohesive and persistent pair bonds with mutual or asymmetrical attraction between adults.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Eisenberg, J.

Adult possums have a distinct gland on the chest and males have a paracloacal gland which is about 2&nbsp;cm in diameter.<ref name = Kerle /> The possum maintains scent posts that are visited commonly. The rock-haunting ringtail possum uses both urine and faeces to mark these areas. This poossum is also thought to mark tree branches using its paracloacal gland.

It uses the [[Unreal Engine 3]]. The game was released for [[Xbox 360]] in August 2011, for [[Microsoft Windows]] in September 2011, and for [[PlayStation 3]] in May 2012.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Rock of Ages - Renaissance.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|This screenshot is taken from ''Rock of Ages''' [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]]-themed setting]]\nThe game combines [[tower defense]] strategy with a rolling ball mechanic similar to games such as ''[[Marble Madness]]'' and ''[[Super Monkey Ball (series)|Super Monkey Ball]]''. The aim of the game is to use a large stone boulder to attack the enemy's castle at the bottom of the hill, while using various defensive structures to defend your own. Players can use a variety of obstacles to defend the path leading up to the castle, such as buildings, dynamite, windmills and animals. Players can also plant money farms in order to raise the funds needed to use certain objects. The player can only add obstacles on green colored landscapes, which turn unusable when obstacles or money farms are planted on top of them. When ready to attack, the player can take control of a boulder and roll it down the hill, avoiding obstacles in order to attack the enemy castle's gate.

It uses the [[Unreal Engine 3]]. The game was released for [[Xbox 360]] in August 2011, for [[Microsoft Windows]] in September 2011, and for [[PlayStation 3]] in May 2012.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Rock of Ages - Renaissance.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|This screenshot is taken from ''Rock of Ages''' [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]]-themed setting]]\nThe game combines [[tower defense]] strategy with a rolling ball mechanic similar to games such as ''[[Marble Madness]]'' and ''[[Super Monkey Ball (series)|Super Monkey Ball]]''. The aim of the game is to use a large stone boulder to attack the enemy's castle at the bottom of the hill, while using various defensive structures to defend your own. Players can use a variety of obstacles to defend the path leading up to the castle, such as buildings, dynamite, windmills and animals. Players can also plant money farms in order to raise the funds needed to use certain objects. The player can only add obstacles on green colored landscapes, which turn unusable when obstacles or money farms are planted on top of them. When ready to attack, the player can take control of a boulder and roll it down the hill, avoiding obstacles in order to attack the enemy castle's gate. If the player has enough points, he can equip the boulder with power-ups, such as armor or magma, which enhance the boulder's defensive or offensive capabilities, though they will lose this power up if the boulder takes sufficient damage. Once the boulder hits the gate, or their boulder breaks after taking too much damage, there is a small recharge period before another boulder can be launched.

This sometimes caused the unit to miss spots when cleaning or be unable to locate its base station to recharge, and did not provide the user a history of which spaces were cleaned.\n\nMore sophisticated models include mapping ability. The unit can use gyro, camera, radar, and laser ([[laser distance sensor]] or LDS) guided systems to create a floor plan, which can be permanently stored for more efficiency, and updated with information on areas which have been (or have not been) cleaned. Thus, the cleaning efficiency is greatly improved and the repetition rate is reduced significantly.\n\nModels with a multiple floor plan feature can store several floor plans.\n\n===Virtual No-Go lines===\nVirtual No-Go lines set boundaries, to restrict the unit's movements to desired cleaning areas.\n\n===Quick recharge=== \nThe 2000 mAh Lithium battery lasts long enough to handle a big house of 200 m\u00b2 (about 100 minutes).\n\nRegular charge time is 5 to 6 hours.\n\nQuick recharge allows the unit to calculate the shortest way to recharge (shortcut path) and charge only as much as needed, so it finishes more quickly (automatic cleaning resumption).\n\n===D-shape===\n[[File:Neato_XV-11.jpg|thumb|D-shape vacuum cleaner]]\nA D-shape design can help capture dirt in corners and along walls better than some round units.\n\n===Schedule===\nScheduled daily cleaning.

In contrast, RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the application's [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.\n\nRPA tools have strong technical similarities to [[graphical user interface testing]] tools. These tools also automate interactions with the GUI, and often do so by [[programming by demonstration|repeating a set of demonstration actions]] performed by a user. RPA tools differ from such systems that allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications, for instance, receiving [[email]] containing an invoice, extracting the data, and then typing that into a [[bookkeeping]] system. \n\n==Historic evolution==\n\nAs a form of automation, the concept has been around for a long time in the form of [[screen scraping]], which can be traced back to early forms of malware. However, RPA is much more extensible, consisting of [[API]] integration into other enterprise applications, connectors into [[ITSM]] systems, [[terminal services]] and even some types of [[AI]] (eg [[Machine Learning]]) services such as [[image recognition]].  It is considered to be a significant technological evolution in the sense that new software platforms are emerging which are sufficiently mature, resilient, scalable and reliable to make this approach viable for use in large enterprises<ref name=\"HfSThreat\">{{Citation|title=Robotic Automation Emerges as a Threat to Traditional Low Cost Outsourcing|publisher=HfS Research|url=http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921062911/http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing|archivedate=2015-09-21}}</ref> (who would otherwise be reluctant due to perceived risks to quality and reputation).\n\n==Deployment==\n\nThe hosting of RPA services also aligns with the metaphor of a software robot, with each robotic instance having its own virtual workstation, much like a human worker. The robot uses keyboard and mouse controls to take actions and execute automations. Normally all of these actions take place in a [[virtual environment]] and not on screen; the robot does not need a physical screen to operate, rather it interprets the screen display electronically. The scalability of modern solutions based on architectures such as these owes much to the advent of [[virtualization]] technology, without which the scalability of large deployments would be limited by available capacity to manage physical hardware and by the associated costs.

In contrast, RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the application's [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.\n\nRPA tools have strong technical similarities to [[graphical user interface testing]] tools. These tools also automate interactions with the GUI, and often do so by [[programming by demonstration|repeating a set of demonstration actions]] performed by a user. RPA tools differ from such systems that allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications, for instance, receiving [[email]] containing an invoice, extracting the data, and then typing that into a [[bookkeeping]] system. \n\n==Historic evolution==\n\nAs a form of automation, the concept has been around for a long time in the form of [[screen scraping]], which can be traced back to early forms of malware. However, RPA is much more extensible, consisting of [[API]] integration into other enterprise applications, connectors into [[ITSM]] systems, [[terminal services]] and even some types of [[AI]] (eg [[Machine Learning]]) services such as [[image recognition]].  It is considered to be a significant technological evolution in the sense that new software platforms are emerging which are sufficiently mature, resilient, scalable and reliable to make this approach viable for use in large enterprises<ref name=\"HfSThreat\">{{Citation|title=Robotic Automation Emerges as a Threat to Traditional Low Cost Outsourcing|publisher=HfS Research|url=http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921062911/http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing|archivedate=2015-09-21}}</ref> (who would otherwise be reluctant due to perceived risks to quality and reputation).\n\n==Deployment==\n\nThe hosting of RPA services also aligns with the metaphor of a software robot, with each robotic instance having its own virtual workstation, much like a human worker. The robot uses keyboard and mouse controls to take actions and execute automations. Normally all of these actions take place in a [[virtual environment]] and not on screen; the robot does not need a physical screen to operate, rather it interprets the screen display electronically. The scalability of modern solutions based on architectures such as these owes much to the advent of [[virtualization]] technology, without which the scalability of large deployments would be limited by available capacity to manage physical hardware and by the associated costs.

Paths lead to the summit from the village of [[Buttermere]], from the nearby summit [[Dale Head]] and from various locations in the valleys to the north.\n\n==Name==\nAccording to influential guidebook author [[Alfred Wainwright]],<ref name=\"wainwright\">[[Alfred Wainwright]]: ''[[A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells]], Book 6, The North Western Fells'': Westmorland Gazette (1964): {{ISBN|0-7112-2459-5}}</ref>  the name Robinson comes from a Richard Robinson who purchased estates in the Buttermere area many centuries ago. These included this unnamed hill which was then called \"Robinson's Fell\", later shortened to Robinson.\n\n==Topography==\nThe [[North Western Fells]] occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north\u2013south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. Robinson stands in the southern sector.  The principal ridge in this group of fells runs east from Buttermere, climbing over Robinson, [[Hindscarth]] and Dale Head. It then turns north, descending gradually toward [[Derwentwater]], the main tops being [[High Spy]], [[Maiden Moor]] and [[Catbells]]. \n\nRobinson appears bland from Buttermere, smooth rounded slopes curving up from the valley floor. Viewed from Keswick or Newlands to the north, its character is altogether different. From here the wall of Robinson Crags drops from the summit of the fell, a great chunk of the hillside seemingly missing.\n\nThe western flanks of the fell fall to Buttermere, the village itself standing on Robinson's territory. The top and bottom sections are quite steep but the slope levels out at 1,500&nbsp;ft to accommodate Buttermere Moss, in Wainwright's words \u201c a wide marshy depression from which water cannot escape except by being carried away in the boots of pedestrians.\u201d<ref name=\"wainwright\"/> At the head of the lower slope is the subsidiary top of High Snockrigg (1,725&nbsp;ft), a fine viewpoint for the Buttermere valley. On the south western rim of the Moss is Goat Crag, overlooking Buttermere lake.\n\nTo the south of Robinson are Gatesgarthdale Beck and the road up [[Honister Pass]]. This side of the fell presents a long and mainly featureless slope, although near the summit are the Hackney Holes, curious rocky depressions of uncertain origin (but see Geology section).  \n\nRunning south east from the summit is Littledale Edge, an airy escarpment which connects to the neighbouring fell of Hindscarth. To the north of the Edge is a steady descent into the head of Little Dale, part of the Newlands catchment. This valley runs north east, flanked by parallel ridges descending from Robinson and Hindscarth, its stream being named Scope Beck. Robinson's north east ridge is rough and craggy towards the top before levelling out onto the grassy spur of High Snab Bank. This finally runs down to [[Newlands Church]] and the hamlet of Little Town. Beneath the nose of the ridge is the confluence of Scope Beck and Keskadale Beck.\n\nKeskadale forms the north western boundary of Robinson and is also the route of [[Newlands Pass]], crossing the North Western Fells from [[Braithwaite]] to Buttermere. Its summit at Newlands Hause (1,092&nbsp;ft) lies beneath the northern edge of Buttermere Moss, from which the waterfall of [[Moss Force]] drops within easy reach of the road.\n\n==Geology==\nRobinson's summit area is composed of rocks of the Buttermere Formation. This is an [[olistostrome]] of disrupted, sheared and folded [[mudstone]], [[siltstone]] and [[sandstone]]. West and north east of the summit are outcroppings of the Robinson Member. This comprises large olistoliths of [[greywacke]] sandstone, with interbedded mudstone and siltstone. The southern flanks are a large area of landslip.<ref name=\"BGS\">British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, ''England & Wales Sheet 29'': BGS (1999)</ref>\n\nThere has been considerable mining activity in the vicinity, particularly at the Goldscope Mine, but this has all taken place beneath the slopes of neighbouring Hindscarth. The remains of a small reservoir can still be seen in Little Dale. Robinson itself has a pair of short levels driven for [[lead]], near to the south east corner of [[Buttermere]] lake.

Another route from Buttermere begins further south at Hassness, working around Goat Crag to join the main path above the moss.

The episodes originally aired on February 7 and 14, 1993, and were written by Randy Rogel and directed by [[Dick Sebast]].<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519616/ |title= Robin's Reckoning |website= Internet Movie Database| accessdate= 21 January 2012}}</ref> It earned the series a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program|Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or Less)]] and is considered one of the best episodes of the series. The second part aired a week later. \n\nThe story is based on the origin of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] ([[Dick Grayson]]) from ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #38 (April 1940), which it shows through flashbacks, intercutting an unfolding mystery in the present with the more significant moments of Robin's life. It touches on Robin uncovering who killed his family and how he first met and joined forces with [[Batman]]. Meanwhile, it also shows how Batman and Robin are slowly growing apart.\n\n==Plot==\n===Part 1===\nDuring a stake-out at a construction site, Batman and Robin catch a gang of mobsters trying to sabotage it, as the wealthy architect refused to be [[extortion|extorted]] by them. While all but one of the mobsters escapes, Batman catches the straggler and demands the name of his boss. The criminal refuses to speak to him or the police, but when Batman shows he's not joking, the criminal blurts out the name \"Billy Marin\", a name that seems to disturb the Caped Crusader. When they return home, Robin is left wondering who Marin really is, but Batman insists that Robin stay out of this one: he works alone for the time being. Following Batman's departure, Robin and [[Alfred Pennyworth]] use the [[Batcave]]'s criminal database to determine the real identity of the crime boss. Robin discovers that Marin is really an alias for [[Tony Zucco]], someone he crossed paths with nine years ago in an event which changed his life.\n\nAs a young child, Dick Grayson was in a popular circus acrobat trio with his parents, \"The Flying Graysons\". While performing at a Wayne Charity convention in [[Gotham City]], Dick overhears Zucco threaten the ringmaster, Mr. Haley, telling him that if he doesn't pay money for \"[[protection racket|protection]]\", accidents will happen. Haley, who takes pride in running an honest business, violently refuses, and in response, Zucco partially saws through a trapeze rope to be used in the Graysons' act. During a portion of the trapeze act involving Dick's parents on the same trapeze, the rope snaps and his parents plummet to their deaths in front of his eyes. Bruce Wayne, who is in the audience, takes pity on the boy, as they are both the orphaned sons of parents murdered in their presence. Upon hearing of Dick's telling of what he saw, Lieutenant [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]] fears that he will have no place to go, as he is a [[material witness]], but Bruce steps in and adopts Dick. As Batman, he becomes obsessed with finding Zucco, to the point that he is rarely home, leaving Dick mostly alone.\n\nBatman tracks down Zucco at his uncle Arnold Stromwell's mansion, where he overhears Stromwell angrily disowning Zucco for bringing Batman down on their heads. Suddenly, Stromwell's guards are alerted to Batman on the property. After fleeing from Batman, Zucco slips out of Gotham, leaving Batman frustrated for not catching the Graysons' killer. As Batman returns to the Batcave, Alfred reminds him that Dick is feeling unloved and scared, which prompts Bruce to realize he must spend more time with him. He tries to comfort the boy, but Dick breaks down in tears and says that he feels responsible for his parents' death. Bruce says that he felt the same way when his own parents were murdered, but assures Dick that the pain will ease in time, and hugs him for the first time.\n\nAfter discovering the crook's identity and reliving the tragedy, Robin realizes that Batman left him out of this to keep him out of the way. Robin begs Batman one last time to let him help, but Batman refuses. Vowing revenge, Robin deliberately disobeys Batman's orders, saying \"Not this time, Alfred. Maybe not ever again.\" Robin leaves on his motorbike to find Zucco.\n\n===Part 2===\nBatman tracks Tony Zucco while, secretly, Robin seeks to find Zucco to avenge his parents' death. As the investigation narrows to an abandoned amusement park, a series of flashbacks finish Robin's origin story. \n\nAfter Zucco's escape from Stromwell, Bruce and Dick grow closer, engaging in a playful fencing match. Alfred then tells Bruce that Jim Gordon is convinced that Zucco might soon try to flee from Gotham, prompting Dick to take matters into his own hands. After running away from [[Wayne Manor]], he unsuccessfully tries to track his parents' killer. While searching a run-down section of Gotham and avoiding Batman, who, unbeknownst to Dick, is also searching for Zucco, Dick rescues a woman threatened by a large man (implied to be a [[prostitute]] and her [[pimp]]). Using his gymnastic skills he defeats the full-grown attacker, knocking him unconscious. The woman treats Dick to dinner in a local diner where a waitress identifies Zucco from a photo. She informs Dick that Zucco is squatting in the condemned building across the street. Dick and Batman find Zucco at roughly the same time, but Dick attacks Zucco, who throws him over a spillway. Batman rescues Dick before he can go over a waterfall, but Zucco uses the distraction to escape. Batman brings Dick back to the [[Batcave]], revealing his [[secret identity]]. He then suggests that Dick's \"temporary\" stay become indefinite, which Dick accepts.\n\nAs the flashback ends, Robin continues his search on his motorcycle. He uses a phone tracer to obtain Zucco's address; in a fit of paranoia, Zucco fires a [[sub-machine gun]] repeatedly into the ceiling, worried about a noise. An injured Batman falls through the weakened ceiling. Using a smoke bomb as a diversion, he limps from the room. Hiding in the amusement park, he hardly has time to treat his wounds before being attacked by Zucco's henchmen. Though limping, he picks off the thugs one-by-one through stealth, fighting several on the [[carousel]]. After the brawl, however, Zucco has the advantage over Batman and prepares to shoot him. At the last moment, Robin crashes through the fence while riding his motorcycle, drives straight at Zucco and, grabbing him by the collar, drags him to the end of a [[pier]]. He holds Zucco over the edge, determined to kill him. Batman arrives and desperately implores Robin not to let his emotions control him, but Robin lashes out at his mentor, exclaiming that he cannot know how he feels. When Batman remains silent, Robin suddenly remembers that Batman is actually the one person he knows who ''would'' know. Abashed, Robin apologizes and relents, handing Zucco to the police. \n\nAs Zucco is hauled away, Robin tells Batman that Batman was right to leave him out of the investigation, as his emotions made him unstable. In a rare moment of vulnerability, Batman explains that he distanced Robin from the investigation because he feared his partner would be killed. The two crimefighters reconcile and leave the pier.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! Actor !!

The episodes originally aired on February 7 and 14, 1993, and were written by Randy Rogel and directed by [[Dick Sebast]].<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519616/ |title= Robin's Reckoning |website= Internet Movie Database| accessdate= 21 January 2012}}</ref> It earned the series a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program|Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or Less)]] and is considered one of the best episodes of the series. The second part aired a week later. \n\nThe story is based on the origin of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] ([[Dick Grayson]]) from ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #38 (April 1940), which it shows through flashbacks, intercutting an unfolding mystery in the present with the more significant moments of Robin's life. It touches on Robin uncovering who killed his family and how he first met and joined forces with [[Batman]]. Meanwhile, it also shows how Batman and Robin are slowly growing apart.\n\n==Plot==\n===Part 1===\nDuring a stake-out at a construction site, Batman and Robin catch a gang of mobsters trying to sabotage it, as the wealthy architect refused to be [[extortion|extorted]] by them. While all but one of the mobsters escapes, Batman catches the straggler and demands the name of his boss. The criminal refuses to speak to him or the police, but when Batman shows he's not joking, the criminal blurts out the name \"Billy Marin\", a name that seems to disturb the Caped Crusader. When they return home, Robin is left wondering who Marin really is, but Batman insists that Robin stay out of this one: he works alone for the time being. Following Batman's departure, Robin and [[Alfred Pennyworth]] use the [[Batcave]]'s criminal database to determine the real identity of the crime boss. Robin discovers that Marin is really an alias for [[Tony Zucco]], someone he crossed paths with nine years ago in an event which changed his life.\n\nAs a young child, Dick Grayson was in a popular circus acrobat trio with his parents, \"The Flying Graysons\". While performing at a Wayne Charity convention in [[Gotham City]], Dick overhears Zucco threaten the ringmaster, Mr. Haley, telling him that if he doesn't pay money for \"[[protection racket|protection]]\", accidents will happen. Haley, who takes pride in running an honest business, violently refuses, and in response, Zucco partially saws through a trapeze rope to be used in the Graysons' act. During a portion of the trapeze act involving Dick's parents on the same trapeze, the rope snaps and his parents plummet to their deaths in front of his eyes. Bruce Wayne, who is in the audience, takes pity on the boy, as they are both the orphaned sons of parents murdered in their presence. Upon hearing of Dick's telling of what he saw, Lieutenant [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]] fears that he will have no place to go, as he is a [[material witness]], but Bruce steps in and adopts Dick.

Emotionally scarred by his parents' divorce when he was still a child, he subsequently developed an interest in acting, which led his maternal aunt, [[Hortense Odlum|Hortense McQuarrie Odlum]] (then the president of [[Bonwit Teller]]), to offer to pay for his enrollment at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in New York City in 1937. Walker lived in her home during his first year in the city.\n\n==Career and personal life==\nWhile attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, Walker met fellow aspiring actress Phylis Isley, who later took the stage name [[Jennifer Jones]]. After a brief courtship, the couple married in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], on January 2, 1939. Walker had some small unbilled parts in films like ''[[Winter Carnival (film)|Winter Carnival]]'' (1939), and two [[Lana Turner]] films at MGM ''[[These Glamour Girls]]'' (1939) and ''[[Dancing Co-Ed]]'' (1939).  \n\n===Radio===\nWalker found work in radio while Isley stayed home and gave birth to two sons in quick succession - actor [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1940)|Robert Walker Jr.]] (1940 - 2019) and Michael Walker (1941 \u2013 2007). \n\nWalker co-starred in the weekly show ''[[Maudie Mason|Maudie's Diary]]'' from August 1941 to September 1942.<ref name=\"Dunning\">{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn |url-access= registration |quote= Maudie's Diary, light comedy. |last=Dunning |first=John |authorlink=John Dunning (detective fiction author) |title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-19-507678-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/442 442]-443 |edition=Revised |accessdate=2019-10-04}}</ref> Isley then returned to auditioning where her luck changed when she was discovered in 1941 by producer [[David O.

He played flight engineer and turret gunner David Thatcher, and it was another box office hit.\n\nWalker starred as a GI preparing for overseas deployment in ''[[The Clock (1945 film)|The Clock]]'', with [[Judy Garland]] playing his love interest in her first straight dramatic film.

Then he did a second Hargrove film, ''[[What Next, Corporal Hargrove?]]'' (1945) and a romantic comedy with [[June Allyson]], ''[[The Sailor Takes a Wife]]'' (1945).\n\nWalker starred in the musical ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946), in which he played the popular composer [[Jerome Kern]], which had rental receipts of over $6 million.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>. He starred as another composer, [[Johannes Brahms]], in ''[[Song of Love (1947 film)|Song of Love]]'' (1947), which co-starred [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Paul Henreid]], which lost MGM over a $1 million. In between, he made a film about the construction of the atomic bomb, ''[[The Beginning or the End]]'' (1946), which also resulted in a loss at the box-office, and a Tracy-Hepburn drama directed by [[Elia Kazan]], ''[[The Sea of Grass (film)|The Sea of Grass]]'' (1947), which was profitable.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>\n\nIn 1948, Walker was borrowed by [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] to star with [[Ava Gardner]] in the film ''[[One Touch of Venus (film)|One Touch of Venus]]'', directed by [[William A.

One of these roles was opposite his first wife, [[Jennifer Jones]], in the World War II epic ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944). He also played [[Jerome Kern]] in ''Till the Clouds Roll By''. Twice divorced by 30, he suffered from [[alcoholism]] and [[mental illness]], which were exacerbated by his painful separation and divorce from Jones.<ref>Linet, pp, 139-186, 229-232</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWalker was born in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Emotionally scarred by his parents' divorce when he was still a child, he subsequently developed an interest in acting, which led his maternal aunt, [[Hortense Odlum|Hortense McQuarrie Odlum]] (then the president of [[Bonwit Teller]]), to offer to pay for his enrollment at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in New York City in 1937. Walker lived in her home during his first year in the city.\n\n==Career and personal life==\nWhile attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, Walker met fellow aspiring actress Phylis Isley, who later took the stage name [[Jennifer Jones]]. After a brief courtship, the couple married in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], on January 2, 1939. Walker had some small unbilled parts in films like ''[[Winter Carnival (film)|Winter Carnival]]'' (1939), and two [[Lana Turner]] films at MGM ''[[These Glamour Girls]]'' (1939) and ''[[Dancing Co-Ed]]'' (1939).  \n\n===Radio===\nWalker found work in radio while Isley stayed home and gave birth to two sons in quick succession - actor [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1940)|Robert Walker Jr.]] (1940 - 2019) and Michael Walker (1941 \u2013 2007). \n\nWalker co-starred in the weekly show ''[[Maudie Mason|Maudie's Diary]]'' from August 1941 to September 1942.<ref name=\"Dunning\">{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn |url-access= registration |quote= Maudie's Diary, light comedy. |last=Dunning |first=John |authorlink=John Dunning (detective fiction author) |title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-19-507678-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/442 442]-443 |edition=Revised |accessdate=2019-10-04}}</ref> Isley then returned to auditioning where her luck changed when she was discovered in 1941 by producer [[David O. Selznick]], who changed her name to Jennifer Jones and groomed her for stardom.\n\n===MGM===\n[[File:Till the Clouds Roll By 1.jpg|thumb|[[Dorothy Patrick]] and Walker in ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946)]]\nThe couple returned to Hollywood, and Selznick's connections helped Walker secure a contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], where he started work on the war drama ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'' (1943), playing a soldier who fights in the Bataan retreat. \n\nHe followed it with a supporting role in ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'' (1943). Both were notable commercial successes.\n\n====Stardom====\nWalker's charming demeanor and boyish good looks caught on with audiences, and he was promoted to stardom with the title part in as the [[Boy next door (stock character)|\"boy-next-door\"]] soldier in ''[[See Here, Private Hargrove (film)|See Here, Private Hargrove]]'' (1944).\n\nHe also appeared in Selznick's ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944), in which he and his  fianc\u00e9 portrayed doomed young lovers during [[World War II]]. By that time, Jones' affair with Selznick was common knowledge, and Jones and Walker separated in November 1943, in mid-production.<ref>\"Jennifer Jones Sues To Divorce Actor Walker\", ''The Washington Post'', April 22, 1945, p. M4.</ref> The filming of their love scenes was torturous as Selznick insisted that Walker perform take after take of each love scene with Jones. She filed for divorce in April 1945. ''Since You Went Away'' was one of the most financially successful movies of 1944, earning over $7 million.<ref name=\"david\">Thomson, David (1993). ''Showman: The Life of David O. Selznick''. Abacus, p. 418.</ref>\n\nBack at MGM, Walker appeared alongside [[Spencer Tracy]] and [[Van Johnson]] in ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'' (1944), the story of the [[Doolittle Raid]]. He played flight engineer and turret gunner David Thatcher, and it was another box office hit.\n\nWalker starred as a GI preparing for overseas deployment in ''[[The Clock (1945 film)|The Clock]]'', with [[Judy Garland]] playing his love interest in her first straight dramatic film. It was profitable though not as successful as Garland's musicals.<ref name=\"Mannix\">{{Citation | title = The Eddie Mannix Ledger | publisher = Margaret Herrick Library, Center for Motion Picture Study | place = Los Angeles}}.</ref>\n\nHe then made a romantic comedy with [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[June Allyson]], ''[[Her Highness and the Bellboy]]'' (1945). Then he did a second Hargrove film, ''[[What Next, Corporal Hargrove?]]'' (1945) and a romantic comedy with [[June Allyson]], ''[[The Sailor Takes a Wife]]'' (1945).\n\nWalker starred in the musical ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946), in which he played the popular composer [[Jerome Kern]], which had rental receipts of over $6 million.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>. He starred as another composer, [[Johannes Brahms]], in ''[[Song of Love (1947 film)|Song of Love]]'' (1947), which co-starred [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Paul Henreid]], which lost MGM over a $1 million. In between, he made a film about the construction of the atomic bomb, ''[[The Beginning or the End]]'' (1946), which also resulted in a loss at the box-office, and a Tracy-Hepburn drama directed by [[Elia Kazan]], ''[[The Sea of Grass (film)|The Sea of Grass]]'' (1947), which was profitable.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>\n\nIn 1948, Walker was borrowed by [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] to star with [[Ava Gardner]] in the film ''[[One Touch of Venus (film)|One Touch of Venus]]'', directed by [[William A. Seiter]]. The film was a non-musical comedy adapted from a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show with music by [[Kurt Weill]]. He married Barbara Ford, the daughter of director [[John Ford]], in July 1948, but the marriage lasted only five months.<ref>\"Robert Walker's Wife Is Granted Divorce\", ''The Washington Post'', December 17, 1948, p. 26.</ref>\n\nBack at MGM he was in some films which lost money, ''[[Please Believe Me]]'' (1950) with [[Deborah Kerr]] and ''[[The Skipper Surprised His Wife]]'' (1950) with [[Joan Leslie]]. More popular was a Western with [[Burt Lancaster]], ''[[Vengeance Valley]]'' (1951), a notable hit.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>\n\n===Final Years===\nIn 1949, Walker spent time at the [[Menninger Foundation|Menninger Clinic]], where he was treated for a psychiatric disorder.<ref>Linet, pp. 229-232</ref> Following his discharge, he was cast by director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951).\n\nIn his final film, Walker played the title role of [[Leo McCarey]]'s ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952), made at the height of the [[Red Scare]]. Despite the film's anti-[[Communist]] themes, Walker was allegedly neither liberal nor conservative and took the job to work with McCarey and co-star [[Helen Hayes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/276071%7C276077/My-Son-John.html|title=My Son John|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> Walker died before production finished, and so angles from his death scene in ''Strangers'' were spliced into a similar melodramatic death scene near the end of the film.<ref name=\"buff\">Ren\u00e9 Jordan. \"Now you see it, now you don't: the art of movie magic,\" in ''The movie-buff's book'', ed.

She called the actor's [[psychiatrist]], Frederick Hacker, who arrived and administered [[amobarbital]] for sedation. Walker had allegedly been drinking before the outburst, and it is believed the combination of amobarbital and alcohol caused him to lose consciousness and stop breathing. Efforts to [[resuscitate]] Walker failed and he was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. He was aged 32.

During the [[Chuck Jones]] era in 1963\u20131967, his voice was provided by Mel Blanc, June Foray and Chuck Jones. Stan Freberg and Terence Monk did his voice in the short ''The Cat Above and the Mouse Below'' (1964) and Dale McKennon did Jerry\u2019s singing voice in ''Cat and Dupli-cat'' (1967). In ''The Tom and Jerry Show'' (1975), Jerry was voiced by John Stephenson. Lou Scheimer voiced him in ''The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show'' (1980\u20131982). Frank Welker voiced him in ''Tom and Jerry Kids'' (1990\u20131993) and ''Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring'' (2002).

Sara Berner also did vocal effects for Jerry in the short ''Baby Puss'' (1943) and voiced him in the short ''The Zoot Cat'' (1944), as well as ''Anchors Aweigh'' (1945) in a dance sequence with him and [[Gene Kelly]]. A sequence in the short ''The Milky Waif'' (1946) features Jerry and Nibbles disguising themselves as a pair of black people, in which the former is voiced by Lillian Randolph (same voice as [[Mammy Two Shoes]]). Paul Frees did Jerry's speaking voice in the shorts ''His Mouse Friday'' (1951) and ''Blue Cat Blues'' (1956). Daws Butler did Jerry's voice in the short ''Mucho Mouse'' (1957). When the [[MGM cartoon studio]] shut down in 1957, [[Gene Deitch]] and European animation studio [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt Studio]] took over, and Deitch did Jerry's voice during the 1961\u201362 era. During the [[Chuck Jones]] era in 1963\u20131967, his voice was provided by Mel Blanc, June Foray and Chuck Jones. Stan Freberg and Terence Monk did his voice in the short ''The Cat Above and the Mouse Below'' (1964) and Dale McKennon did Jerry\u2019s singing voice in ''Cat and Dupli-cat'' (1967). In ''The Tom and Jerry Show'' (1975), Jerry was voiced by John Stephenson. Lou Scheimer voiced him in ''The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show'' (1980\u20131982). Frank Welker voiced him in ''Tom and Jerry Kids'' (1990\u20131993) and ''Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring'' (2002). Dana Hill voiced Jerry in ''Tom and Jerry: The Movie'' (1992).\n\nOther voice actors include Bill Kopp in ''Tom and Jerry: Blast Off to Mars'' (2005) and ''Tom and Jerry: The Fast and the Furry'' (2005), Spike Brandt in ''The Karate Guard'' (2005), ''Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale'' (2007), ''Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes'' (2010), ''Tom and Jerry: Robin Hood and His Merry Mouse'' (2012), ''Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure'' (2013), ''Tom and Jerry: The Lost Dragon'' (2014), ''Tom and Jerry: Spy Quest'' (2015), and ''Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'' (2017), Bob Bergen ([[Porky Pig]] from ''[[Looney Tunes]]'') in ''Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz'' (2011) and ''Tom and Jerry: Back to Oz'' (2016), Sam Vincent in ''Tom and Jerry Tales'' (2006\u20132008), Alan Marriott in ''Tom and Jerry in Fists of Furry'' (2000) and ''Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers'' (2002), Marc Silk in ''Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers'' (2002; as Monster Jerry), and Jeff Bergman in a Cartoon Network Latin America bumper. In ''The Tom and Jerry Show (2014 TV series)'', Jerry's vocal effects are provided by sound designer Rich Danhakl and archival recordings of William Hanna from the original theatrical shorts.\n\n==Popular culture==\nTom and Jerry were planned to appear as a cameo in the deleted scene \"Acme's Funeral\" from the 1988 film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hill |first1=Jim |title=Storyboards reveal what Marvin Acme's funeral in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" would have looked like |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2014/05/08/storyboards-reveal-what-marvin-acme-s-funeral-in-quot-who-framed-roger-rabbit-quot-would-have-looked-like.aspx |website=jimhillmedia.com |accessdate=3 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Tom and Jerry]]\n*[[List of Hanna-Barbera characters]]\n*[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Cartoons}}\n{{Tom and Jerry}}\n{{Hanna-Barbera}}\n\n[[Category:Tom and Jerry characters]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1940]]\n[[Category:Fictional attempted suicides]]\n[[Category:Fictional anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional mice and rats]]\n[[Category:MGM cartoon characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional mute characters]]\n", "name_user": "50.236.76.29", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Mouse"}

The main components are [[color code]]d lines to indicate each line or service, with named icons to indicate [[rapid transit station|stations]] or [[bus stop|stops]].\n\nTransit maps can be found in the transit vehicles, at the [[railway platform|platforms]] or in printed [[public transport timetable|timetables]]. Their primary function is to help users to efficiently use the public transport system, including which stations function as [[Interchange station|interchange]] between lines. Unlike conventional maps, transit maps are usually not geographically accurate\u2014instead they use straight lines and fixed angles, and often illustrate a fixed distance between stations, compressing those in the outer area of the system and expanding those close to the center.\n\n==History==\nThe mapping of transit systems was at first generally geographically accurate, but abstract route-maps of individual lines (usually displayed inside the carriages) can be traced back as early as 1908 (London's [[District line]]), and certainly there are examples from European and American railroad cartography as early as the 1890s where geographical features have been removed and the routes of lines have been artificially straightened out. But it was [[George Dow]] of the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] who was the first to launch a diagrammatic representation of an entire rail transport network (in 1929); his work is seen by historians of the subject as being part of the inspiration for [[Harry Beck]] when he launched his iconic [[Tube map|London Underground map]] in 1933.\n\nAfter this pioneering work, many transit authorities worldwide imitated the diagrammatic look for their own networks, some while continuing to also publish hybrid versions that were geographically accurate.\n\nEarly maps of the [[Berlin U-Bahn]], [[Berlin S-Bahn]], [[Boston T]], [[Paris M\u00e9tro]], and [[New York City Subway]] also exhibited some elements of the [[diagrammatic form]].\n\nThe new [[Madrid Metro]] map (of 2007), designed by the RaRo Agency, took the idea of a simple diagram one step further by becoming one of the first produced for a major network to remove diagonal lines altogether; it is constituted just by horizontal and vertical lines only at right angles to each other. After many complaints over its disadvantages, the company reverted to the previous map in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/ccaa/2013/05/31/madrid/1370009373_652545.html|title=Metro recupera el plano geogr\u00e1fico|first=Pilar|last=\u00c1lvarez|date=31 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2018|via=elpais.com}}</ref>\n\nTransit maps are now increasingly digitized and can be shown in many forms online.\n\n==Elements==\n[[File:Miami Metro Map 2017.png|thumb|right|Schematic transit map of [[Miami]]/[[Transportation in South Florida#Public transportation|South Florida regional rail transit]], where there are several types of systems from intercity and commuter rail down to [[automated people mover]]s and a small heavy rail system with a [[bus rapid transit]] feeder. It is not to scale, the area covered is about {{convert|100|mi|km}} north-south by {{convert|10|mi|km}} wide.]]\nThe primary purpose of a transit map is to help passengers\u2014especially those unfamiliar with the system\u2014to take the correct routes to [[travel]] between two points; this may include having to change vehicle or mode in the course of the trip. The map uses [[symbol]]s to illustrate the lines, stations and transfer points, as well as a system of geographic identification. At the same time the map must remain simple to allow overview, and be usable by those unfamiliar with the geography of the area.\n\nStations are marked with symbols that break the line, along with their names, so they may be referred to on other maps or travel itineraries. Further help may be granted through the inclusion of important tourist attractions and other locations such as the city center; these may be identified through symbols or wording.\n\n[[Color code|Color coding]] allows the map to specify each line in an easy way, allowing the users to quickly identify where each specific line goes; if it does not go to the desired destination, the colors and symbols allow the user to identify a feasible point of transfer between lines. Symbols such as aircraft may be used to illustrate [[airport]]s, and symbols of trains may be used to identify stations that allow transfer to other modes, such as [[commuter rail|commuter]] or [[intercity train|intercity]] train services. With the widespread use of [[zone pricing]] for fare calculation, systems that span more than one zone need a system to inform the use which zone a particular station is located in. Common ways include varying the tone of the background color, or by running a weak line along the zone boundaries.\n\nMany transit authorities publish multiple maps of their systems; this can be done by isolating one mode of transport, for instance only rapid transit or only bus, onto a single map, or instead the authorities publish maps covering only a limited area, but with greater detail. Another modification is to produce geographically accurate maps of the system, to allow users to better understand the routes. Even if official geographical accurate maps are not available, these can often be obtained from unofficial sources since the information is available from other sources.\n\n==Iconic status==\nThere are a growing number of [[books]], [[websites]] and [[works of art]] on the subject of urban rail and metro map design and use. There are now hundreds of examples of diagrams in an urban rail or metro map style that are used to represent everything from other transit networks like [[bus]]es and national rail services to [[sanitary sewer|sewerage]] systems and [[Derbyshire]] [[public house]]s.\n\nOne of the most well-known adaptations of an urban rail map was [[The Great Bear (lithograph)|''The Great Bear'', a lithograph]] by Simon Patterson. First shown in 1992 and nominated for the [[Turner Prize]], ''The Great Bear'' replaces station names on the London Underground map with those of explorers, saints, film stars, philosophers and comedians. Other artists such as Scott Rosenbaum, and [[Ralph Gray (artist)|Ralph Gray]] have also taken the iconic style of the urban rail map and made new artistic creations ranging from the abstract to the [[solar system]]. Following the success of these the idea of adapting other urban rail and metro maps has spread so that now almost every major subway or rapid transit system with a map has been doctored with different names, often [[anagram]]s of the original station name.\n\nSome maps including those for the rapid transit systems of [[New York City Subway|New York City]], [[Washington Metro|Washington D.C.]], [[MBTA subway|Boston]], [[Montreal Metro|Montreal]], and [[RTD Bus & Rail|Denver]], have been recreated to include the names of local bars that have a good selection of craft beers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pubway Maps|url=http://www.unquestionabletaste.com/pubway.html|website=Unquestionable Taste|publisher=Unquestionable Taste|accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bicycle map]]\n*[[Isochrone map]]\n*[[Road map]]\n*[[Walkability#Mapping walkability]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Mr Beck's Underground Map'', [[Ken Garland]], Capital Transport, London, 1994.  {{ISBN|1-85414-168-6}}\n*''No Need To Ask'', David Leboff and Tim Demuth, Capital Transport, London, 1999.  {{ISBN|1-85414-215-1}}\n*''Metro Maps Of The World'', [[Mark Ovenden]], Capital Transport, London, 2003.  {{ISBN|1-85414-288-7}}\n*''Das Berliner U- und S-Bahnnetz'', Alfred B.
