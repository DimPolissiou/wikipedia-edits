He was a [[Irish House of Commons|Member of the Irish Parliament]] (MP) from 1775 to 1801 and a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) from 1805 to 1820. He has been described as a superb orator and a romantic. With generous enthusiasm he demanded that Ireland should be granted its rightful status, that of an independent nation, though he always insisted that Ireland would remain linked to Great Britain by a common crown and by sharing a common political tradition.<ref>R. B. McDowell (1994) \"The Protestant Nation (1775\u20131800),\" in T. W. Moody and F. X. Martin, eds., ''The Course of Irish History''. 2nd ed. p. 233. {{ISBN|978-1570980152}}</ref>\n\nGrattan opposed the [[Act of Union 1800]] that merged the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], but later sat as a member of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|united Parliament]] in [[London]].\n\n==Early life==\nGrattan was born at [[Fishamble Street]], [[Dublin]], and baptised in the nearby church of [[Church of St. John the Evangelist, Dublin|St. John the Evangelist]] in 1746.<ref>D. A. Chart (1907) [https://web.archive.org/web/20071027074731/http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/Chart/history11.htm \"The Volunteers and the United Irishmen\"] in ''The Story of Dublin''. J. M. Dent & Co., London</ref> A member of the [[Anglo-Irish]] elite of [[Church of Ireland|Protestant]] background, Grattan was the son of [[James Grattan (Wicklow MP)|James Grattan]] MP, of [[Belcamp Park]], [[County Dublin]], and Mary, youngest daughter of [[Thomas Marlay]], [[Attorney-General of Ireland]], [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]] and finally Lord Chief Justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)|Court of King's Bench]]. Grattan attended [[Drogheda Grammar School]] and then went on to become a distinguished student at [[Trinity College Dublin]], where he began a lifelong study of classical literature, and was especially interested in the great orators of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. Like his friend [[Henry Flood]], Grattan worked on his natural eloquence and oratory skills by studying models such as [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]] and [[Junius]]. In the late 1760s  and early 1770s he spent some years in London, and he visited France in 1771.  He attended debates in the British  House of Commons regularly, and also enjoyed visiting the celebrated [[Grecian Coffee House]] in [[Devereux Court]], where he met [[Oliver Goldsmith]].  It was in London where he formed his lifelong friendship with [[Robert Day (politician)|Robert Day]], later a judge of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)]].\n\nAfter studying at the  [[Middle Temple ]], London and then [[King's Inns]], Dublin and being called to the Irish bar in 1772, although he never seriously practised law but was drawn to politics, influenced by [[Henry Flood|Flood]]. He entered the Irish Parliament for [[Charlemont (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Charlemont]] in 1775, sponsored by [[James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont|Lord Charlemont]], just as Flood had damaged his credibility by accepting office. Grattan quickly superseded Flood in the leadership of the national party, not least because his oratorical powers were unsurpassed among his contemporaries.\n\n==In the Irish Parliament==\nCatholics and Presbyterians\u2014who together made up a large majority of the Irish population\u2014were completely excluded from public life at this time under the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], in force in Ireland from 1691 until the early 1780s. The Presbyterians of Ulster likewise had little power. Power was held by the King's Viceroy and by a small element, the Anglo-Irish families loyal to the Anglican [[Church of Ireland]] who owned most of the land.\n\nThe politicians of the national party now fought for the Irish Parliament, not with the intention of liberating the Catholic majority, but to set the Irish parliament free from constitutional bondage to the British [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. By virtue of [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]], a statute of King [[Henry VII of England]], all proposed Irish legislation had to be submitted to the Privy Council for its approval under the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal of England]] before being passed by the Irish Parliament. A bill so approved might be accepted or rejected, but not amended. More recent British Acts had further emphasised the complete dependence of the Irish parliament, and the appellate jurisdiction of the [[Irish House of Lords]] had also been annulled. Moreover, the British Houses claimed and exercised the power to legislate directly for Ireland without even the nominal concurrence of the parliament in Dublin. This was the constitution which [[William Molyneux]] and Swift had denounced, which Flood had attacked, and which Grattan was to destroy, becoming leaders of the [[Irish Patriot Party|Patriot movement]].\n[[Image:IrishHC1780.jpg|left|thumb|'''The [[Irish House of Commons]]''' by Francis Wheatley (1780) shows Grattan (standing on right in red jacket) addressing the House of Commons]]\nCalls for the legislative independence of Ireland at the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteer]] Convention at [[Dungannon]], [[County Tyrone]], greatly influenced the [[Constitution of 1782|decision of the government in 1782]] to make concessions. It was through ranks of Volunteers drawn up outside the Irish Parliament in Dublin that Grattan passed on 16 April 1782, amidst unparalleled popular enthusiasm, to move a declaration of the independence of the Irish parliament. \"I found Ireland on her knees,\" Grattan exclaimed, \"I watched over her with a paternal solicitude; I have traced her progress from injuries to arms, and from arms to liberty. Spirit of Swift, spirit of Molyneux, your genius has prevailed! Ireland is now a nation!\" After a month of negotiation the claims of Ireland were conceded. The gratitude of his countrymen to Grattan was shown by a parliamentary grant of \u00a3100,000, which had to be reduced by half before he would accept it.\n\nGrattan then asked for the British House of Commons to reconfirm the [[British Government]]'s decision, and on 22 January 1783, the final Act was passed by parliament in London, including the text:\n<blockquote> ''Be it enacted that the right claimed by the people of Ireland to be bound only by laws enacted by his Majesty and the Parliament of that kingdom, in all cases whatever shall be, and is hereby declared to be established and ascertained for ever, and shall at no time be questioned or questionable.'' </blockquote> In September of the same year, Grattan became a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]]. He was expelled in 1798, but was re-admitted on 9 August 1806.\n\nIn Dublin, he was a member of [[Daly's Club]].<ref>T.H.S. Escott (1913) ''Club Makers and Club Members''. [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028066979#page/n371/mode/2up pp. 329\u2013333]</ref>\n\n==\"Grattan's Parliament\"==\n{{main|Grattan's Parliament}}\n{{see also|Irish Patriot Party|Irish Houses of Parliament}}\n[[File:Henry Grattan EMWEA.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Grattan]]\nOne of the first acts of Grattan's parliament was to prove its loyalty to the Constitution by passing a vote for the support of 20,000 sailors for the [[Royal Navy]]. Grattan was loyal to the Crown and the British connection. He was, however, anxious to achieve moderate parliamentary reform, and, unlike Flood, he favoured [[Catholic Emancipation]]. It was evident that without reform, the Irish House of Commons would not be able to make much use of its newly won legislative independence. Though now free from Westminster constitutional control, it was still subject to the influence of corruption, which the British government had wielded through the British and Irish borough owners, known as the \"undertakers\", or more directly through the great executive offices. Grattan's parliament had no control over the Irish executive. The [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] and his chief secretary continued to be appointed by the British ministers; their tenure of office depended on the vicissitudes of English, not Irish, party politics; the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]] was exercised in Ireland on the advice of British ministers.\n\nThe Irish House of Commons was unrepresentative of the Irish people at a time when democracy was rare in [[Europe]]. The majority were excluded, whom were either Roman Catholics or Presbyterians; two-thirds of the members of the House of Commons were returned by small boroughs at the disposal of individual patrons, whose support was bought by the distribution of peerages and pensions. It was to give stability and true independence to the new constitution that Grattan pressed for reform. Having quarreled with Flood over simple repeal, Grattan also differed from him on the question of maintaining the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Volunteer Convention]]. He opposed the policy of protective duties, but supported [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]]'s commercial propositions in 1785 for establishing Free Trade between Great Britain and Ireland. This, however, had to be abandoned owing to the hostility of the British mercantile classes. Grattan supported the government for a time after 1782, and spoke and voted for the repressive legislation that followed the [[Whiteboy]] violence in 1785; but as the years passed and without Pitt's personal favour towards parliamentary reform resulting in legislation, he gravitated towards the opposition, agitated for [[commutation of tithes]] in Ireland, and supported the Whigs on the [[Charles James Fox#1788\u20131789: The Regency Crisis|regency question]] in 1788. In 1790, Grattan stood for [[Dublin City (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dublin City]], a seat he held until 1798.\n\nIn 1792\u201393, he succeeded in carrying a [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791#The Irish Act of 1793|Roman Catholic Relief Act]] conferring the franchise on Catholics; in 1794, in conjunction with [[William Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby|William Ponsonby]], he introduced a reform bill which was even milder than Flood's bill of 1783. He was as anxious as Flood had been to retain the legislative power in the hands of men of property. Grattan had a strong conviction that while Ireland could best be governed by the Irish, democracy in Ireland would inevitably turn to plunder and anarchy. At the same time he wished to open membership of the House of Commons to Catholic men of property, a proposal that was the logical corollary of the Relief Act of 1793.\n\nThe defeat of Grattan's mild proposals helped to promote more extreme opinions, which, under growing influence from France, were now making inroads in Ireland. The Catholic question had come to the fore, and when a powerful section of the Whigs joined Pitt's ministry in 1794, [[William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam|Lord Fitzwilliam]], who shared Grattan's views, was appointed Viceroy, expectations for further [[Catholic Emancipation|Catholic relief]] were raised. That may have been Pitt's intention, but it is not clear how far Lord Fitzwilliam had been authorised to pledge the government. Fitzwilliam privately asked Grattan to propose a Bill for Catholic emancipation, promising British government support. It appeared, however that the Viceroy had either misunderstood or exceeded his instructions; on 19 February 1795, Fitzwilliam was recalled. In the outburst of indignation, followed by increasing disaffection which this produced in Ireland, Grattan acted with conspicuous moderation and loyalty. This won him warm acknowledgments from a member of the British cabinet.\n\nThat cabinet, however, doubtless influenced by the wishes of the King, to whom Emancipation was anathema, was now determined to firmly resist the Catholic demands, with the result that Ireland rapidly drifted towards rebellion. Grattan warned the government in a series of masterly speeches of the lawless condition to which Ireland had been driven. He could now count on no more than 40 followers in the Irish House of Commons, and his words were unheeded. In protest he retired from parliament in May 1797, and departed from his customary moderation by attacking the government in his 24-page ''Letter to the Citizens of Dublin'', in which he said it was now \"absolutely necessary to reform the state\" as the people no longer had confidence in parliament.\n\n==Rebellion and Union==\n[[Image:gillraygrattan1798.jpg|thumb|''[[James Gillray|Gillray's]] 1798 cartoon of Henry Grattan'']]\nAt this time antipathy towards the [[Protestant Ascendancy|Anglican elite]] in Ireland was such that people of different faiths were ready to combine for common political objects. Thus the Presbyterians of the north, who were mainly republican in sentiment, combined with a section of the Roman Catholics to form the [[United Irishmen]] organisation, promoting revolutionary ideas imported from [[France]]; and a party prepared to welcome a French invasion soon came into existence. Thus stimulated, the increasing disaffection culminated in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]]. The Presbyterian-Catholic rebellion in Ulster was accompanied by outbreaks elsewhere, notably in [[Wexford Rebellion|County Wexford]]. Grattan was cruelly lampooned by [[James Gillray]] as a rebel leader for his liberal views and his stance against a political union with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].\n\n[[Image:Henry Grattan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Henry Grattan]]\nAlmost immediately, the project of a legislative union between the British and Irish parliaments, which had been from time to time discussed since the beginning of the 18th century, was taken up in earnest by Pitt's government. Grattan fiercely denounced the scheme.\n\nThe constitution of Grattan's parliament offered no security, as the differences over the regency question had made evident that in matters of imperial interest the policy of the Irish parliament and that of [[Parliament of Great Britain|Great Britain]] would be in agreement. At a moment when Britain was engaged in a life-and-death struggle with France, it was impossible for the ministry to ignore the danger, recently emphasised by the fact that the independent constitution of 1782 offered no safeguard against armed revolt. Sectarian violence during the rebellion put an end to the growing reconciliation between Roman Catholics and Presbyterians, and the island divided anew into two hostile factions.\n\nIt was from the Anglican [[Church of Ireland|established church]], and particularly from the [[Orange Order|Orangemen]], that the bitterest opposition to the union proceeded. The proposal found support among the Roman Catholic clergy and especially the bishops, while in no part of Ireland was it received with more favour than in the city of [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. This attitude of the Catholics was caused by Pitt's encouragement of the expectation that [[Catholic emancipation]], the commutation of tithes, and the endowment of the Catholic priesthood, would accompany or quickly follow the passing of the measure.\n\nWhen in 1799, the government brought forward its bill it was defeated in the Irish House of Commons. Grattan was still in retirement. His popularity had declined, and the fact that his proposals for parliamentary reform and Catholic emancipation had become the watchwords of the United Irishmen had brought him the bitter hostility of the governing classes. He was dismissed from the Privy Council; his portrait was removed from the hall of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]]; the Merchant Guild of Dublin struck his name off their rolls. The threatened destruction of the constitution of 1782 quickly restored its author to his former place in the affections of the Irish people. The parliamentary recess had been employed by the government in securing by lavish corruption a majority in favour of their policy. On 15 January 1800, the Irish Parliament met for its last session; on the same day Grattan secured by purchase a seat for [[Wicklow Borough (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Wicklow Borough]]; and at a late hour, while the debate was proceeding, he appeared to take his seat, and was cheered from the galleries. Grattan's strength gave way when he rose to speak, and he obtained leave to address the House sitting. Nevertheless, his speech was a superb effort of oratory; for more than two hours he kept them spellbound. After prolonged debates Grattan, on 26 May, spoke finally against the committal of the bill, ending with an impassioned [[peroration]] in which he declared, \"I will remain anchored here with fidelity to the fortunes of my country, faithful to her freedom, faithful to her fall.\" These were the last words spoken by Grattan in the Irish Parliament.\n\nThe bill establishing the union was carried through its final stages by substantial majorities. One of Grattan's main grounds of opposition to the union had been his dread of seeing the political leadership in Ireland pass out of the hands of the landed gentry; and he prophesied that the time would come when Ireland would send to the united parliament a hundred of the greatest rascals in the kingdom. Like Flood before him, Grattan had no leaning towards democracy; and he anticipated that by the removal of the centre of political interest from Ireland the evil of absenteeism would be intensified.\n\n==In the Parliament of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland==\nFor the next five years, Grattan took no active part in public affairs; it was not again until 1805, that he became a Member of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] for [[Malton (UK Parliament constituency)|Malton]]. He modestly took his seat on one of the back benches, till [[Charles James Fox|Fox]] brought him forward, exclaiming, \"This is no place for the Irish [[Demosthenes]]!\" His first speech was on the Catholic question and all agreed with the description of his speech by the ''Annual Register'' as one of the most brilliant and eloquent ever made within the walls of parliament. When Fox and [[William Grenville]] came into power in 1806 Grattan, who sat at this time for [[Dublin City (UK Parliament constituency)|Dublin City]], was offered, but refused to accept, an office in the government. In the following year he showed the strength of his judgment and character by supporting, in spite of consequent unpopularity in Ireland, a measure for increasing the powers of the executive to deal with Irish disorder. Roman Catholic emancipation, which he continued to advocate with unflagging energy, though now advanced in age, became complicated after 1808 by the question whether a [[Royal veto of the appointment of bishops|veto on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops]] should rest with the crown.\n\nGrattan supported the veto, but a more radical Catholic party was now arising in Ireland under the leadership of [[Daniel O'Connell]], and Grattan's influence gradually declined. He seldom spoke in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] after 1810, the most notable exception being in 1815, when he separated himself from the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and supported the final struggle against [[Napoleon I|Napol\u00e9on]]. His last speech of all, in 1819, contained a passage referring to the Union he had so passionately resisted, which exhibits the statesmanship, and at the same time the equable quality, of Grattan's character. His sentiments with regard to the policy of the Union remained, he said, unchanged; but the marriage, having taken place, it is now the duty, as it ought to be the inclination, of every individual to render it as fruitful, as profitable and as advantageous as possible.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Henry Grattan - Merrion Square.jpg|thumb|The bust of Henry Grattan in [[Merrion Square]], Dublin]]\nIn the following summer, after crossing from Ireland to Britain when in poor health to bring forward the [[Irish question]] once more, he became seriously ill. On his death-bed he spoke generously of [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]], and with warm eulogy of his former rival, Flood. He died on 6 June 1820, and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] close to the tombs of Pitt and Fox. His statue is in the Outer Lobby of the [[Palace of Westminster]].\n\n[[Sydney Smith]] said of Grattan soon after his death: \"No government ever dismayed him. The world could not bribe him. He thought only of Ireland; lived for no other object; dedicated to her his beautiful fancy, his elegant wit, his manly courage, and all the splendour of his astonishing eloquence.\"\n\nThe building housing the faculty of Law and Government at [[Dublin City University]] has been named in his honour. [[Grattan Bridge]] crossing the river [[River Liffey|Liffey]] between Parliament Street on the south side of Dublin and Capel Street on the north side is also named in his honour.\n\n==Family==\nGrattan's father was James Grattan (d. 1766), a [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] and then [[Dublin City (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|MP for Dublin City]], who married a daughter of Thomas Marlay, Mary.\n\nGrattan married Henrietta Fitzgerald in 1782, the daughter of Nicholas Fitzgerald of [[County Mayo]] (d. 1761), a son of Thomas FitzGerald of [[Turlough, County Mayo]] and Elizabeth Browne. Henrietta's mother Margaret was the daughter of James Stephenson and Ann Price. Grattan's in-laws' history gave him a sensitivity to former Irish political difficulties, as Henrietta's [[Cavalier]] great-grandfather John Fitzgerald was transplanted from [[Gorteens Castle]] in [[County Kilkenny]] to Mayo in 1653 under the [[Cromwellian Settlement]], and his son Thomas felt it necessary to conform to the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1717.<ref>HLL Denny (1913) ''A history of the family of Lister''. Ballantyne, Edinburgh.</ref>\n\nThe Grattans had two sons and two daughters. The sons were \u2013 James Grattan of Tinnehinch, MP for [[Wicklow (UK Parliament constituency)|County Wicklow]]; and [[Henry Grattan (junior)]] of Moyrath, MP for [[Dublin City (UK Parliament constituency)|Dublin City]] and then for [[Meath (UK Parliament constituency)|County Meath]]. His daughter Mary Anne married first John Blachford (1771\u20101832), and secondly [[Thomas Dalzell, 7th Earl of Carnwath]], dying in 1853. Harriet (d.1865) married the Revd Wake of Courteenhall.\n\n==Bibliography==\n[[File:Henry Grattan oversee his Parliament.JPG|thumb|Grattan statue beside the old Irish Parliament, [[College Green, Dublin|College Green]], Dublin]]\n* Gwynn, Stephen.

\u2013 6 June 1820) was an Irish politician and lawyer who campaigned for legislative freedom for the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] in the late 18th century from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. He was a [[Irish House of Commons|Member of the Irish Parliament]] (MP) from 1775 to 1801 and a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) from 1805 to 1820. He has been described as a superb orator and a romantic. With generous enthusiasm he demanded that Ireland should be granted its rightful status, that of an independent nation, though he always insisted that Ireland would remain linked to Great Britain by a common crown and by sharing a common political tradition.<ref>R. B. McDowell (1994) \"The Protestant Nation (1775\u20131800),\" in T. W. Moody and F. X. Martin, eds., ''The Course of Irish History''. 2nd ed. p. 233. {{ISBN|978-1570980152}}</ref>\n\nGrattan opposed the [[Act of Union 1800]] that merged the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], but later sat as a member of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|united Parliament]] in [[London]].\n\n==Early life==\nGrattan was born at [[Fishamble Street]], [[Dublin]], and baptised in the nearby church of [[Church of St. John the Evangelist, Dublin|St. John the Evangelist]] in 1746.<ref>D. A. Chart (1907) [https://web.archive.org/web/20071027074731/http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/Chart/history11.htm \"The Volunteers and the United Irishmen\"] in ''The Story of Dublin''. J. M. Dent & Co., London</ref> A member of the [[Anglo-Irish]] elite of [[Church of Ireland|Protestant]] background, Grattan was the son of [[James Grattan (Wicklow MP)|James Grattan]] MP, of [[Belcamp Park]], [[County Dublin]], and Mary, youngest daughter of [[Thomas Marlay]], [[Attorney-General of Ireland]], [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]] and finally Lord Chief Justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)|Court of King's Bench]]. Grattan attended [[Drogheda Grammar School]] and then went on to become a distinguished student at [[Trinity College Dublin]], where he began a lifelong study of classical literature, and was especially interested in the great orators of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. Like his friend [[Henry Flood]], Grattan worked on his natural eloquence and oratory skills by studying models such as [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]] and [[Junius]]. In the late 1760s  and early 1770s he spent some years in London, and he visited France in 1771.  He attended debates in the British  House of Commons regularly, and also enjoyed visiting the celebrated [[Grecian Coffee House]] in [[Devereux Court]], where he met [[Oliver Goldsmith]].  It was in London where he formed his lifelong friendship with [[Robert Day (politician)|Robert Day]], later a judge of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)]].\n\nAfter studying at the  [[Middle Temple ]], London and then [[King's Inns]], Dublin and being called to the Irish bar in 1772, although he never seriously practised law but was drawn to politics, influenced by [[Henry Flood|Flood]]. He entered the Irish Parliament for [[Charlemont (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Charlemont]] in 1775, sponsored by [[James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont|Lord Charlemont]], just as Flood had damaged his credibility by accepting office. Grattan quickly superseded Flood in the leadership of the national party, not least because his oratorical powers were unsurpassed among his contemporaries.\n\n==In the Irish Parliament==\nCatholics and Presbyterians\u2014who together made up a large majority of the Irish population\u2014were completely excluded from public life at this time under the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], in force in Ireland from 1691 until the early 1780s. The Presbyterians of Ulster likewise had little power. Power was held by the King's Viceroy and by a small element, the Anglo-Irish families loyal to the Anglican [[Church of Ireland]] who owned most of the land.\n\nThe politicians of the national party now fought for the Irish Parliament, not with the intention of liberating the Catholic majority, but to set the Irish parliament free from constitutional bondage to the British [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. By virtue of [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]], a statute of King [[Henry VII of England]], all proposed Irish legislation had to be submitted to the Privy Council for its approval under the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal of England]] before being passed by the Irish Parliament. A bill so approved might be accepted or rejected, but not amended. More recent British Acts had further emphasised the complete dependence of the Irish parliament, and the appellate jurisdiction of the [[Irish House of Lords]] had also been annulled. Moreover, the British Houses claimed and exercised the power to legislate directly for Ireland without even the nominal concurrence of the parliament in Dublin. This was the constitution which [[William Molyneux]] and Swift had denounced, which Flood had attacked, and which Grattan was to destroy, becoming leaders of the [[Irish Patriot Party|Patriot movement]].\n[[Image:IrishHC1780.jpg|left|thumb|'''The [[Irish House of Commons]]''' by Francis Wheatley (1780) shows Grattan (standing on right in red jacket) addressing the House of Commons]]\nCalls for the legislative independence of Ireland at the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteer]] Convention at [[Dungannon]], [[County Tyrone]], greatly influenced the [[Constitution of 1782|decision of the government in 1782]] to make concessions. It was through ranks of Volunteers drawn up outside the Irish Parliament in Dublin that Grattan passed on 16 April 1782, amidst unparalleled popular enthusiasm, to move a declaration of the independence of the Irish parliament. \"I found Ireland on her knees,\" Grattan exclaimed, \"I watched over her with a paternal solicitude; I have traced her progress from injuries to arms, and from arms to liberty. Spirit of Swift, spirit of Molyneux, your genius has prevailed! Ireland is now a nation!\" After a month of negotiation the claims of Ireland were conceded. The gratitude of his countrymen to Grattan was shown by a parliamentary grant of \u00a3100,000, which had to be reduced by half before he would accept it.\n\nGrattan then asked for the British House of Commons to reconfirm the [[British Government]]'s decision, and on 22 January 1783, the final Act was passed by parliament in London, including the text:\n<blockquote> ''Be it enacted that the right claimed by the people of Ireland to be bound only by laws enacted by his Majesty and the Parliament of that kingdom, in all cases whatever shall be, and is hereby declared to be established and ascertained for ever, and shall at no time be questioned or questionable.'' </blockquote> In September of the same year, Grattan became a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]]. He was expelled in 1798, but was re-admitted on 9 August 1806.\n\nIn Dublin, he was a member of [[Daly's Club]].<ref>T.H.S. Escott (1913) ''Club Makers and Club Members''. [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028066979#page/n371/mode/2up pp. 329\u2013333]</ref>\n\n==\"Grattan's Parliament\"==\n{{main|Grattan's Parliament}}\n{{see also|Irish Patriot Party|Irish Houses of Parliament}}\n[[File:Henry Grattan EMWEA.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Grattan]]\nOne of the first acts of Grattan's parliament was to prove its loyalty to the Constitution by passing a vote for the support of 20,000 sailors for the [[Royal Navy]]. Grattan was loyal to the Crown and the British connection. He was, however, anxious to achieve moderate parliamentary reform, and, unlike Flood, he favoured [[Catholic Emancipation]]. It was evident that without reform, the Irish House of Commons would not be able to make much use of its newly won legislative independence. Though now free from Westminster constitutional control, it was still subject to the influence of corruption, which the British government had wielded through the British and Irish borough owners, known as the \"undertakers\", or more directly through the great executive offices. Grattan's parliament had no control over the Irish executive. The [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] and his chief secretary continued to be appointed by the British ministers; their tenure of office depended on the vicissitudes of English, not Irish, party politics; the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]] was exercised in Ireland on the advice of British ministers.\n\nThe Irish House of Commons was unrepresentative of the Irish people at a time when democracy was rare in [[Europe]]. The majority were excluded, whom were either Roman Catholics or Presbyterians; two-thirds of the members of the House of Commons were returned by small boroughs at the disposal of individual patrons, whose support was bought by the distribution of peerages and pensions. It was to give stability and true independence to the new constitution that Grattan pressed for reform. Having quarreled with Flood over simple repeal, Grattan also differed from him on the question of maintaining the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Volunteer Convention]]. He opposed the policy of protective duties, but supported [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]]'s commercial propositions in 1785 for establishing Free Trade between Great Britain and Ireland. This, however, had to be abandoned owing to the hostility of the British mercantile classes. Grattan supported the government for a time after 1782, and spoke and voted for the repressive legislation that followed the [[Whiteboy]] violence in 1785; but as the years passed and without Pitt's personal favour towards parliamentary reform resulting in legislation, he gravitated towards the opposition, agitated for [[commutation of tithes]] in Ireland, and supported the Whigs on the [[Charles James Fox#1788\u20131789: The Regency Crisis|regency question]] in 1788. In 1790, Grattan stood for [[Dublin City (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dublin City]], a seat he held until 1798.\n\nIn 1792\u201393, he succeeded in carrying a [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791#The Irish Act of 1793|Roman Catholic Relief Act]] conferring the franchise on Catholics; in 1794, in conjunction with [[William Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby|William Ponsonby]], he introduced a reform bill which was even milder than Flood's bill of 1783. He was as anxious as Flood had been to retain the legislative power in the hands of men of property. Grattan had a strong conviction that while Ireland could best be governed by the Irish, democracy in Ireland would inevitably turn to plunder and anarchy. At the same time he wished to open membership of the House of Commons to Catholic men of property, a proposal that was the logical corollary of the Relief Act of 1793.\n\nThe defeat of Grattan's mild proposals helped to promote more extreme opinions, which, under growing influence from France, were now making inroads in Ireland. The Catholic question had come to the fore, and when a powerful section of the Whigs joined Pitt's ministry in 1794, [[William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam|Lord Fitzwilliam]], who shared Grattan's views, was appointed Viceroy, expectations for further [[Catholic Emancipation|Catholic relief]] were raised. That may have been Pitt's intention, but it is not clear how far Lord Fitzwilliam had been authorised to pledge the government. Fitzwilliam privately asked Grattan to propose a Bill for Catholic emancipation, promising British government support. It appeared, however that the Viceroy had either misunderstood or exceeded his instructions; on 19 February 1795, Fitzwilliam was recalled. In the outburst of indignation, followed by increasing disaffection which this produced in Ireland, Grattan acted with conspicuous moderation and loyalty. This won him warm acknowledgments from a member of the British cabinet.\n\nThat cabinet, however, doubtless influenced by the wishes of the King, to whom Emancipation was anathema, was now determined to firmly resist the Catholic demands, with the result that Ireland rapidly drifted towards rebellion. Grattan warned the government in a series of masterly speeches of the lawless condition to which Ireland had been driven. He could now count on no more than 40 followers in the Irish House of Commons, and his words were unheeded. In protest he retired from parliament in May 1797, and departed from his customary moderation by attacking the government in his 24-page ''Letter to the Citizens of Dublin'', in which he said it was now \"absolutely necessary to reform the state\" as the people no longer had confidence in parliament.\n\n==Rebellion and Union==\n[[Image:gillraygrattan1798.jpg|thumb|''[[James Gillray|Gillray's]] 1798 cartoon of Henry Grattan'']]\nAt this time antipathy towards the [[Protestant Ascendancy|Anglican elite]] in Ireland was such that people of different faiths were ready to combine for common political objects. Thus the Presbyterians of the north, who were mainly republican in sentiment, combined with a section of the Roman Catholics to form the [[United Irishmen]] organisation, promoting revolutionary ideas imported from [[France]]; and a party prepared to welcome a French invasion soon came into existence. Thus stimulated, the increasing disaffection culminated in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]]. The Presbyterian-Catholic rebellion in Ulster was accompanied by outbreaks elsewhere, notably in [[Wexford Rebellion|County Wexford]]. Grattan was cruelly lampooned by [[James Gillray]] as a rebel leader for his liberal views and his stance against a political union with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].\n\n[[Image:Henry Grattan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Henry Grattan]]\nAlmost immediately, the project of a legislative union between the British and Irish parliaments, which had been from time to time discussed since the beginning of the 18th century, was taken up in earnest by Pitt's government. Grattan fiercely denounced the scheme.\n\nThe constitution of Grattan's parliament offered no security, as the differences over the regency question had made evident that in matters of imperial interest the policy of the Irish parliament and that of [[Parliament of Great Britain|Great Britain]] would be in agreement. At a moment when Britain was engaged in a life-and-death struggle with France, it was impossible for the ministry to ignore the danger, recently emphasised by the fact that the independent constitution of 1782 offered no safeguard against armed revolt. Sectarian violence during the rebellion put an end to the growing reconciliation between Roman Catholics and Presbyterians, and the island divided anew into two hostile factions.\n\nIt was from the Anglican [[Church of Ireland|established church]], and particularly from the [[Orange Order|Orangemen]], that the bitterest opposition to the union proceeded. The proposal found support among the Roman Catholic clergy and especially the bishops, while in no part of Ireland was it received with more favour than in the city of [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. This attitude of the Catholics was caused by Pitt's encouragement of the expectation that [[Catholic emancipation]], the commutation of tithes, and the endowment of the Catholic priesthood, would accompany or quickly follow the passing of the measure.\n\nWhen in 1799, the government brought forward its bill it was defeated in the Irish House of Commons. Grattan was still in retirement. His popularity had declined, and the fact that his proposals for parliamentary reform and Catholic emancipation had become the watchwords of the United Irishmen had brought him the bitter hostility of the governing classes. He was dismissed from the Privy Council; his portrait was removed from the hall of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]]; the Merchant Guild of Dublin struck his name off their rolls. The threatened destruction of the constitution of 1782 quickly restored its author to his former place in the affections of the Irish people. The parliamentary recess had been employed by the government in securing by lavish corruption a majority in favour of their policy. On 15 January 1800, the Irish Parliament met for its last session; on the same day Grattan secured by purchase a seat for [[Wicklow Borough (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Wicklow Borough]]; and at a late hour, while the debate was proceeding, he appeared to take his seat, and was cheered from the galleries. Grattan's strength gave way when he rose to speak, and he obtained leave to address the House sitting. Nevertheless, his speech was a superb effort of oratory; for more than two hours he kept them spellbound. After prolonged debates Grattan, on 26 May, spoke finally against the committal of the bill, ending with an impassioned [[peroration]] in which he declared, \"I will remain anchored here with fidelity to the fortunes of my country, faithful to her freedom, faithful to her fall.\" These were the last words spoken by Grattan in the Irish Parliament.\n\nThe bill establishing the union was carried through its final stages by substantial majorities. One of Grattan's main grounds of opposition to the union had been his dread of seeing the political leadership in Ireland pass out of the hands of the landed gentry; and he prophesied that the time would come when Ireland would send to the united parliament a hundred of the greatest rascals in the kingdom. Like Flood before him, Grattan had no leaning towards democracy; and he anticipated that by the removal of the centre of political interest from Ireland the evil of absenteeism would be intensified.\n\n==In the Parliament of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland==\nFor the next five years, Grattan took no active part in public affairs; it was not again until 1805, that he became a Member of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] for [[Malton (UK Parliament constituency)|Malton]]. He modestly took his seat on one of the back benches, till [[Charles James Fox|Fox]] brought him forward, exclaiming, \"This is no place for the Irish [[Demosthenes]]!\" His first speech was on the Catholic question and all agreed with the description of his speech by the ''Annual Register'' as one of the most brilliant and eloquent ever made within the walls of parliament. When Fox and [[William Grenville]] came into power in 1806 Grattan, who sat at this time for [[Dublin City (UK Parliament constituency)|Dublin City]], was offered, but refused to accept, an office in the government. In the following year he showed the strength of his judgment and character by supporting, in spite of consequent unpopularity in Ireland, a measure for increasing the powers of the executive to deal with Irish disorder. Roman Catholic emancipation, which he continued to advocate with unflagging energy, though now advanced in age, became complicated after 1808 by the question whether a [[Royal veto of the appointment of bishops|veto on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops]] should rest with the crown.\n\nGrattan supported the veto, but a more radical Catholic party was now arising in Ireland under the leadership of [[Daniel O'Connell]], and Grattan's influence gradually declined. He seldom spoke in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] after 1810, the most notable exception being in 1815, when he separated himself from the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and supported the final struggle against [[Napoleon I|Napol\u00e9on]]. His last speech of all, in 1819, contained a passage referring to the Union he had so passionately resisted, which exhibits the statesmanship, and at the same time the equable quality, of Grattan's character. His sentiments with regard to the policy of the Union remained, he said, unchanged; but the marriage, having taken place, it is now the duty, as it ought to be the inclination, of every individual to render it as fruitful, as profitable and as advantageous as possible.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Henry Grattan - Merrion Square.jpg|thumb|The bust of Henry Grattan in [[Merrion Square]], Dublin]]\nIn the following summer, after crossing from Ireland to Britain when in poor health to bring forward the [[Irish question]] once more, he became seriously ill. On his death-bed he spoke generously of [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]], and with warm eulogy of his former rival, Flood. He died on 6 June 1820, and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] close to the tombs of Pitt and Fox. His statue is in the Outer Lobby of the [[Palace of Westminster]].\n\n[[Sydney Smith]] said of Grattan soon after his death: \"No government ever dismayed him. The world could not bribe him. He thought only of Ireland; lived for no other object; dedicated to her his beautiful fancy, his elegant wit, his manly courage, and all the splendour of his astonishing eloquence.\"\n\nThe building housing the faculty of Law and Government at [[Dublin City University]] has been named in his honour. [[Grattan Bridge]] crossing the river [[River Liffey|Liffey]] between Parliament Street on the south side of Dublin and Capel Street on the north side is also named in his honour.\n\n==Family==\nGrattan's father was James Grattan (d. 1766), a [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] and then [[Dublin City (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|MP for Dublin City]], who married a daughter of Thomas Marlay, Mary.\n\nGrattan married Henrietta Fitzgerald in 1782, the daughter of Nicholas Fitzgerald of [[County Mayo]] (d. 1761), a son of Thomas FitzGerald of [[Turlough, County Mayo]] and Elizabeth Browne. Henrietta's mother Margaret was the daughter of James Stephenson and Ann Price. Grattan's in-laws' history gave him a sensitivity to former Irish political difficulties, as Henrietta's [[Cavalier]] great-grandfather John Fitzgerald was transplanted from [[Gorteens Castle]] in [[County Kilkenny]] to Mayo in 1653 under the [[Cromwellian Settlement]], and his son Thomas felt it necessary to conform to the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1717.<ref>HLL Denny (1913) ''A history of the family of Lister''. Ballantyne, Edinburgh.</ref>\n\nThe Grattans had two sons and two daughters. The sons were \u2013 James Grattan of Tinnehinch, MP for [[Wicklow (UK Parliament constituency)|County Wicklow]]; and [[Henry Grattan (junior)]] of Moyrath, MP for [[Dublin City (UK Parliament constituency)|Dublin City]] and then for [[Meath (UK Parliament constituency)|County Meath]]. His daughter Mary Anne married first John Blachford (1771\u20101832), and secondly [[Thomas Dalzell, 7th Earl of Carnwath]], dying in 1853. Harriet (d.1865) married the Revd Wake of Courteenhall.\n\n==Bibliography==\n[[File:Henry Grattan oversee his Parliament.JPG|thumb|Grattan statue beside the old Irish Parliament, [[College Green, Dublin|College Green]], Dublin]]\n* Gwynn, Stephen.

It station is built along alongside [[Bayfront Avenue]].\n\nWhen Stage 3 of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]] opens in 2021, Marina Bay station will become a triple-line interchange, joining [[Dhoby Ghaut MRT station]] and [[Outram Park MRT station]].

The station requires significant diversion and land reclamation works at Marina Bay to facilitate the development of New Downtown.\n\nOn 8 January 2006, this station was one of the four stations that participated in [[Counter-terrorism in Singapore#Exercise Northstar V|Exercise Northstar V]].\n\nBefore regular southbound trains were scheduled to terminate at [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier]] from 13 March 2017 (Mondays - Fridays)<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBe4SZDt5fA&t=163s Train services extended to Marina South Pier on weekdays]</ref>, 16 April 2017 (Sundays)<ref>[https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=3e93bed1-e3c4-47aa-941c-d0f317ba03c5 Factsheet by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) & SMRT: Full-day Sunday Trial of New Signalling System for North-South Line from 16 April 2017]</ref> as well as 13 May 2017 (Saturdays), platforms at Marina Bay were used both for train turnarounds and trains heading to/from Marina South Pier. Using the set of points that is north of the station, terminating trains arriving from Raffles Place can use either platforms before heading back. Passing through services still calls at the platform.\n\n===Circle Line Interchange===\n[[File:Circle Line Marina Bay platform.jpg|thumb|left|The Circle line platforms]]\nContract 901 for the construction and completion of Marina Bay CCL station was awarded to Hock Lian Seng Infrastructure Pte. Ltd. for S$348.4&nbsp;million in February 2008. The scope also includes addition and alteration works to the existing North South line (NSL) Marina Bay station, localised diversions of the [[East Coast Parkway]] and Marina Street as well as demolition of an expunged vehicular underpass. While the exits remain the same, it also allows the walking of 500 metres to the [[Downtown MRT station]]. It was an integral part of the Marina Bay development and interchange for two major MRT lines. Marina Bay station is also located in the public park, to be similar to Central Linear Park. The design aims to integrate the station into the park through the landscaping. The translucent canopy acts as a skylight to allow natural light penetrating into the underground hall. To further minimise the visual impact of the station to the surrounding park landscape, the lift, escalators, lightweight canopy and the reflective pool were visible from the street level, giving users full view of the park from the station entrance, similar to [[Bras Basah MRT station|Bras Basah]]. In addition, while the platforms at basement 1 are accessible only from the ticket concourse at basement 2, it is the first underground station to do the reverse, starting from the platforms at B1 and ending at the concourse at B2.<ref>[https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=1891 LTA awards civil contract for Marina Bay MRT Station]</ref>\n\nThe station was awarded the winner of the Small Project Award at the World Architecture Festival in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.worldarchitecturefestival.com/world-architecture-festival-winners-2012|title=World Architecture Festival Winners 2012|publisher=EMAP publishing|accessdate = 14 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Circle Line Stage 6====\nThe station was announced on 29 October 2015 as part of the Stage 6 of the Circle line.

The station requires significant diversion and land reclamation works at Marina Bay to facilitate the development of New Downtown.\n\nOn 8 January 2006, this station was one of the four stations that participated in [[Counter-terrorism in Singapore#Exercise Northstar V|Exercise Northstar V]].\n\nBefore regular southbound trains were scheduled to terminate at [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier]] from 13 March 2017 (Mondays - Fridays)<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBe4SZDt5fA&t=163s Train services extended to Marina South Pier on weekdays]</ref>, 16 April 2017 (Sundays)<ref>[https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=3e93bed1-e3c4-47aa-941c-d0f317ba03c5 Factsheet by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) & SMRT: Full-day Sunday Trial of New Signalling System for North-South Line from 16 April 2017]</ref> as well as 13 May 2017 (Saturdays), platforms at Marina Bay were used both for train turnarounds and trains heading to/from Marina South Pier. Using the set of points that is north of the station, terminating trains arriving from Raffles Place can use either platforms before heading back. Passing through services still calls at the platform.\n\n===Circle Line Interchange===\n[[File:Circle Line Marina Bay platform.jpg|thumb|left|The Circle line platforms.]]\nContract 901 for the construction and completion of Marina Bay CCL station was awarded to Hock Lian Seng Infrastructure Pte. Ltd. for S$348.4&nbsp;million in February 2008. The scope also includes addition and alteration works to the existing North South line (NSL) Marina Bay station, localised diversions of the [[East Coast Parkway]] and Marina Street as well as demolition of an expunged vehicular underpass. While the exits remain the same, it also allows the walking of 500 metres to the [[Downtown MRT station]]. It was an integral part of the Marina Bay development and interchange for two major MRT lines. Marina Bay station is also located in the public park, to be similar to Central Linear Park. The design aims to integrate the station into the park through the landscaping. The translucent canopy acts as a skylight to allow natural light penetrating into the underground hall. To further minimise the visual impact of the station to the surrounding park landscape, the lift, escalators, lightweight canopy and the reflective pool were visible from the street level, giving users full view of the park from the station entrance, similar to [[Bras Basah MRT station|Bras Basah]]. In addition, while the platforms at basement 1 are accessible only from the ticket concourse at basement 2, it is the first underground station to do the reverse, starting from the platforms at B1 and ending at the concourse at B2.<ref>[https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=1891 LTA awards civil contract for Marina Bay MRT Station]</ref>\n\nThe station was awarded the winner of the Small Project Award at the World Architecture Festival in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.worldarchitecturefestival.com/world-architecture-festival-winners-2012|title=World Architecture Festival Winners 2012|publisher=EMAP publishing|accessdate = 14 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Circle Line Stage 6====\nThe station was announced on 29 October 2015 as part of the Stage 6 of the Circle line.

From 1969 to 2004, he published and edited the poetry magazine ''Aquarius'', which, according to ''[[The Irish Post]]'', made him \"one of the leading figures on the international poetry scene\".

He was baptised as John Edward Glackin, but became Edward Linden upon being adopted by Mary Glenn and Eddie Linden (the latter being related to his mother through marriage), whom he came to regard as his parents. He grew up in the mining town of [[Bellshill]], 2 miles from Motherwell and 10 miles south of [[Glasgow]]. In 1944, Mary died, and her widower Eddie, a miner, remarried a [[Scottish Presbyterian]] woman who disliked the young Edward. She failed to have him put in an asylum, so instead had him sent to an orphanage run by the [[Sisters of Charity]].<ref name=\"irishtimes\" /><ref name=\"irishpost\" /> He never knew his biological father Joe (Joseph) Waters, but did know his biological mother, Bessie (Elizabeth) Glackin.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Patterson, Glenn (interviewer)|date= 17 September 2007|title= Eddie Linden - Interview ( Part 1 )|medium= Television production|publisher=NVTV|language=English}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 14, he was \"released\" from this institution and often slept rough. He was put to work in a [[coal mine]], and after being fired from this job, worked in a [[steel mill]]. He was also employed as a ticket collector and [[Porter (railroad)|porter]] at [[Hamilton West railway station]]. Linden was rejected for [[national service]] [[conscription]] in the army as he was deemed underweight and suffered from a [[duodenal ulcer]]. Having been raised as a [[Roman Catholic]], he also struggled with his homosexuality, and even sought medical treatment from doctors, but abandoned this after falling out with the staff.<ref name=\"magdala\">{{citeweb|url=https://friendsofthemagdala.co.uk/under-ken-wood/eddie-linden/|title=Eddie Linden |website=Friends of the Magdala|accessdate=19 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Political activism==\nLinden's political and literary awakening came when he joined the [[Young Communist League (Great Britain)|Young Communist League]]. \"At that time, the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]] had education classes - not just [[Marxist]] classes, but in [[Dickens]], in [[Shakespeare]] - that was another discovery for me.

That year, he met the [[Catholic priest]] [[Anthony Ross (priest)|Anthony Ross]], who helped Linden come to terms with his homosexuality and encouraged him to take part in peace protests: he became involved with the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] and the ''[[Catholic Worker]]''. This lead to friendships with the journalist [[Douglas Hyde (author)|Douglas Hyde]] and [[Jesuit]] priest [[Thomas Roberts (bishop)|Thomas Roberts]]. Upon Ross's death, Linden wrote an obituary of him for ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref name=\"irishtimes\" />\n\nAn April 1959 article by Hyde in ''[[The Catholic Herald]]'' outlined the origins of the Catholic Nuclear Disarmament Group, for whom Linden would become secretary. He later noted:\n<blockquote>It was some time at the end of the 1950s when I first came across a little bookshop in [[Glasgow]] called the Freedom Bookshop. This was run by an eccentric Cockney, [[Guy Aldred]], who was then editing a paper called ''[[Freedom (newspaper)|Freedom]]''. I saw a book entitled ''I Believe'' by Douglas Hyde. Also that day in that shop I picked up the American ''Catholic Worker'' produced by a remarkable person named [[Dorothy Day]]. The paper identified itself with the cause of peace and reconciliation. The book told a story of a man who had dedicated his life to Communism. At the time I was disillusioned but was still loosely attached to the Communist Party and the Young Communist League. These two items were to lead me back to a reconversion to [[Christianity]] of much greater social awareness.<ref name=\"irishtimes\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1959, Linden arranged a meeting in Highbury Place for the Catholic CND which was attended by novelist [[Pamela Frankau]], founder of the British version of ''The Catholic Worker'' [[Barbara Wall (writer)|Barbara Wall]] and John O'Connor, secretary of [[Pax Christi]], the [[Catholic peace traditions|Catholic peace movement]]. According to Linden, \"the whole idea was to publicise the immorality of the bomb\": the group were affiliated the national CND, and a letter was sent to [[General de Gaulle]] to protest the French test explosion. The first Catholic banner was seen on an [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermasteron March]] in 1959, with 200 people: 600 associate members were part of the organisation. By 1966, Linden had become less politically active, and gone to study at the [[Catholic Workers' College]] in [[Oxford]]; Linden has latterly described himself as a Catholic who finds it difficult to believe in God.<ref name=\"tablet\">{{cite web |last1=Stanford |first1=Peter |title=A thorn in the flesh: Poet Eddie Linden is a catholic who finds it difficult to believe in god |url=https://www.thetablet.co.uk/features/2/10874/a-thorn-in-the-flesh-poet-eddie-linden-is-a-catholic-who-finds-it-difficult-to-believe-in-god |website=The Tablet |publisher=The Tablet Publishing Company |accessdate=19 March 2019}}</ref> Meanwhile, in 1963, he co-founded the [[Simon Community]], a [[Charitable organization|charity]] in aid of the [[homeless]], with Anton Wallich-Clifford, a probation officer at [[Bow Street Magistrates Court]].<ref name=\"irishtimes\" />\n\n===Party membership===\nAged 16, Linden joined the [[Independent Labour Party]], which had disaffiliated from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] some years previously, despite having played a key role in the latter's early years. The ILP had lost all of its MPs by this point, however, and Linden describes it as having been \"in its dying days\". It was his involvement with the Communist Party that led to him moving to London, but after several years, he came to the realisation that he was not a communist. He would go on to join the Labour Party and, aged 84, stated, \"I've been a Labour man all my life\". In spite of his early inclinations towards the radical left, he did not support the [[Left-wing politics|left-winger]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]], who [[Labour leadership of Jeremy Corbyn|led the party from 2015 to 2020]], and voted for the [[centre-left]] candidacy of [[Sir Keir Starmer]] in the [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|contest to succeed Corbyn]].

He had known Barker's son [[Sebastian Barker|Sebastian]] at Oxford, and in 1965 met his mother, the writer [[Elizabeth Smart (Canadian author)|Elizabeth Smart]], who adopted him as a prot\u00e9ge; she was complimentary about the letters Linden wrote.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Patterson, Glenn (interviewer)|date= 19 September 2007|title= Eddie Linden - Interview ( Part 2 )|medium= Television production|minutes=2|publisher=NVTV|language=English}}</ref> In 1980, ''City of Razors'', a collection of his poems, was published.<ref name=\"razors\">{{cite book |last1=Linden |first1=Eddie |title=City of Razors: And Other Poems |date=1980 |publisher=J.

He was baptised as John Edward Glackin, but became Edward Linden upon being adopted by Mary Glenn and Eddie Linden (the latter being related to his mother through marriage), whom he came to regard as his parents. He grew up in the mining town of [[Bellshill]], 2 miles from Motherwell and 10 miles south of [[Glasgow]]. In 1944, Mary died, and her widower Eddie, a miner, remarried a [[Scottish Presbyterian]] woman who disliked the young Edward. She failed to have him put in an asylum, so instead had him sent to an orphanage run by the [[Sisters of Charity]].<ref name=\"irishtimes\" /><ref name=\"irishpost\" /> He never knew his biological father Joe (Joseph) Waters, but did know his biological mother, Bessie (Elizabeth) Glackin.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Patterson, Glenn (interviewer)|date= 17 September 2007|title= Eddie Linden - Interview ( Part 1 )|medium= Television production|publisher=NVTV|language=English}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 14, he was \"released\" from this institution and often slept rough. He was put to work in a [[coal mine]], and after being fired from this job, worked in a [[steel mill]]. He was also employed as a ticket collector and [[Porter (railroad)|porter]] at [[Hamilton West railway station]]. Linden was rejected for [[national service]] [[conscription]] in the army as he was deemed underweight and suffered from a [[duodenal ulcer]]. Having been raised as a [[Roman Catholic]], he also struggled with his homosexuality, and even sought medical treatment from doctors, but abandoned this after falling out with the staff.<ref name=\"magdala\">{{citeweb|url=https://friendsofthemagdala.co.uk/under-ken-wood/eddie-linden/|title=Eddie Linden |website=Friends of the Magdala|accessdate=19 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Political activism==\nLinden's political and literary awakening came when he joined the [[Young Communist League (Great Britain)|Young Communist League]]. \"At that time, the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]] had education classes - not just [[Marxist]] classes, but in [[Dickens]], in [[Shakespeare]] - that was another discovery for me. Then there was the [[Workers' Educational Association]].

That year, he met the [[Catholic priest]] [[Anthony Ross (priest)|Anthony Ross]], who helped Linden come to terms with his homosexuality and encouraged him to take part in peace protests: he became involved with the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] and the ''[[Catholic Worker]]''. This lead to friendships with the journalist [[Douglas Hyde (author)|Douglas Hyde]] and [[Jesuit]] priest [[Thomas Roberts (bishop)|Thomas Roberts]]. Upon Ross's death, Linden wrote an obituary of him for ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref name=\"irishtimes\" />\n\nAn April 1959 article by Hyde in ''[[The Catholic Herald]]'' outlined the origins of the Catholic Nuclear Disarmament Group, for whom Linden would become secretary. He later noted:\n<blockquote>It was some time at the end of the 1950s when I first came across a little bookshop in [[Glasgow]] called the Freedom Bookshop. This was run by an eccentric Cockney, [[Guy Aldred]], who was then editing a paper called ''[[Freedom (newspaper)|Freedom]]''. I saw a book entitled ''I Believe'' by Douglas Hyde. Also that day in that shop I picked up the American ''Catholic Worker'' produced by a remarkable person named [[Dorothy Day]]. The paper identified itself with the cause of peace and reconciliation. The book told a story of a man who had dedicated his life to Communism. At the time I was disillusioned but was still loosely attached to the Communist Party and the Young Communist League. These two items were to lead me back to a reconversion to [[Christianity]] of much greater social awareness.<ref name=\"irishtimes\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1959, Linden arranged a meeting in Highbury Place for the Catholic CND which was attended by novelist [[Pamela Frankau]], founder of the British version of ''The Catholic Worker'' [[Barbara Wall (writer)|Barbara Wall]] and John O'Connor, secretary of [[Pax Christi]], the [[Catholic peace traditions|Catholic peace movement]]. According to Linden, \"the whole idea was to publicise the immorality of the bomb\": the group were affiliated the national CND, and a letter was sent to [[General de Gaulle]] to protest the French test explosion. The first Catholic banner was seen on an [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermasteron March]] in 1959, with 200 people: 600 associate members were part of the organisation. By 1966, Linden had become less politically active, and gone to study at the [[Catholic Workers' College]] in [[Oxford]]; Linden has latterly described himself as a Catholic who finds it difficult to believe in God.<ref name=\"tablet\">{{cite web |last1=Stanford |first1=Peter |title=A thorn in the flesh: Poet Eddie Linden is a catholic who finds it difficult to believe in god |url=https://www.thetablet.co.uk/features/2/10874/a-thorn-in-the-flesh-poet-eddie-linden-is-a-catholic-who-finds-it-difficult-to-believe-in-god |website=The Tablet |publisher=The Tablet Publishing Company |accessdate=19 March 2019}}</ref> Meanwhile, in 1963, he co-founded the [[Simon Community]], a [[Charitable organization|charity]] in aid of the [[homeless]], with Anton Wallich-Clifford, a probation officer at [[Bow Street Magistrates Court]].<ref name=\"irishtimes\" />\n\n===Party membership===\nAged 16, Linden joined the [[Independent Labour Party]], which had disaffiliated from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] some years previously, despite having played a key role in the latter's early years. The ILP had lost all of its MPs by this point, however, and Linden describes it as having been \"in its dying days\". It was his involvement with the Communist Party that led to him moving to London, but after several years, he came to the realisation that he was not a communist. He would go on to join the Labour Party and, aged 84, stated, \"I've been a Labour man all my life\". In spite of his early inclinations towards the radical left, he did not support the [[left-winger]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]], who [[Labour leadership of Jeremy Corbyn|led the party from 2015 to 2020]], and voted for the [[centre-left]] candidacy of [[Sir Keir Starmer]] in the [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|contest to succeed Corbyn]].

Under al-Afghani's influence, Abduh combined journalism, politics, and his own fascination in Islamic mystical spirituality. Al-Afghani taught Abduh about the problems of Egypt and the Islamic world and about the technological achievements of the [[Western world|West]].\n\nIn 1877, Abduh was granted the degree of 'Alim (\"teacher\") and he started to teach logic, theology and ethics at al-Azhar. In 1878, he was appointed professor of history at Cairo's teachers' training college [[Dar al-Ulum]], later incorporated into [[Cairo University]]. He was also appointed to teach [[Arabic]] at the Khedivial School of Languages.<ref name=KG/>\n\nAbduh was appointed editor-in-chief of ''[[Al-Waqa'i' al-Misriyya|al-Waq\u0101\u02bei\u02bf al-Mi\u1e63riyya]]'', the official state newspaper. He was dedicated to reforming all aspects of Egyptian society and believed that education was the best way to achieve this goal. He was in favor of a good religious education, which would strengthen a child\u2019s morals, and a scientific education, which would nurture a child\u2019s ability to reason. In his articles he criticized corruption, superstition, and the luxurious lives of the rich.<ref name=KG/>\n\nIn 1879, due to his political activity, [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]] was exiled and Abduh was exiled to his home village. The following year he was granted control of the national gazette and used this as a means to spread his anti-colonial ideas, and the need for social and religious reforms.<ref name=EB/> He was exiled from Egypt by the British in 1882 for six years, for supporting the Egyptian nationalist [[Urabi Revolt|revolt]] led by [[Ahmed Orabi]] in 1879. He had stated that every society should be allowed to choose a suitable form of government based on its history and its present circumstances.<ref name=KG/> Abduh spent several years in Ottoman  [[Lebanon]], where he helped establish an Islamic educational system. In 1884 he moved to [[Paris|Paris, France]] where he joined al-Afghani in publishing ''[[Al-Urwah al-Wuthqa|The Firmest Bond]]'' (al-Urwah al-Wuthqa), an Islamic revolutionary journal that promoted anti-British views.  Abduh also visited Britain and discussed the state of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] with high-ranking officials. In 1885, after brief stays in [[England]] and [[Tunisia]], he returned to [[Beirut]], as a teacher,<ref name=EB/> and was surrounded by scholars from different religious backgrounds. During his stay there he dedicated his efforts toward furthering respect and friendship between [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]].<ref name=KG/>\n\nWhen he returned to Egypt in 1888, Abduh began his legal career. He was appointed judge in the Courts of First Instance of the Native Tribunals and in 1891, he became a consultative member of the Court of Appeal.<ref name=EB/> In 1899, he was appointed [[Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah|Grand Mufti of Egypt]], the highest Islamic title, and he held this position until he died.  As a judge, he was involved in many decisions, some of which were considered liberal such as the ability to utilize meat butchered by non-Muslims and the acceptance of loan interest. His liberal views endeared him to the British, in particular [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]]; however they also caused a rift between him and the khedive [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas Hilmi]] and the nationalist leader [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]].<ref name=EB/> While he was in Egypt, Abduh founded a religious society, became president of a society for the revival of Arab sciences and worked towards reforming [[al-Azhar University]] by putting forth proposals to improve examinations, the curriculum and the working conditions for both professors and students. He travelled a great deal and met with European scholars in [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]]. He studied French law and read a great many European and Arab works in the libraries of [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]]. The conclusions he drew from his travels were that Muslims suffer from ignorance about their own religion and the despotism of unjust rulers.<ref name=KG/>\n\nMuhammad Abduh died in [[Alexandria]] on 11 July 1905.

He said that in Islam, man was not created to be led by a bridle, but that man was given intelligence so that he could be guided by knowledge. According to Abduh, a teacher\u2019s role was to direct men towards study. He believed that Islam encouraged men to detach from the world of their ancestors and that Islam reproved the slavish imitation of tradition. He said that the two greatest possessions relating to religion that man was graced with were independence of will and independence of thought and opinion. It was with the help of these tools that he could attain happiness. He believed that the growth of western civilization in Europe was based on these two principles. He thought that Europeans were roused to act after a large number of them were able to exercise their choice and to seek out facts with their minds.<ref>Gelvin , J. L. (2008). The Modern Middle East (2nd ed., pp. 161-162). New York: Oxford university Press.</ref>\nHis Muslim opponents refer to him as an infidel; however, his followers called him a sage, a reviver of religion and a reforming leader. He is conventionally graced with the epithets \u201cal-Ust\u0101dh al-Im\u0101m\u201d and \u201cal-Shaykh al-Muft\u012b\u201d.  In his works, he portrays God as educating humanity from its childhood through its youth and then on to adulthood. According to him, Islam is the only religion whose dogmas can be proven by reasoning. Abduh does not advocate returning to the early stages of Islam. He was against [[polygamy]] and thought that it was an archaic custom. He believed in a form of Islam that would liberate men from enslavement, provide equal rights for all human beings, abolish the religious scholar\u2019s monopoly on [[exegesis]] and abolish [[racial discrimination]] and religious compulsion.<ref name=KG/>\n\nAbduh regularly called for better friendship between religious communities. He made great efforts to preach harmony between [[Sunni]]s and [[Shia]]s. Broadly\nspeaking, he preached brotherhood between all schools of thought in Islam. However, he criticized what he perceived as errors such as [[superstition]]s coming from popular [[Sufism]].<ref name=Benzine>Benzine, Rachid. Les nouveaux penseurs de l'islam, p. 43-44.</ref> As Christianity was the second biggest religion in [[Egypt]], he devoted special efforts towards friendship between Muslims and Christians. He had many Christian friends and many a time he stood up to defend [[Copts]].<ref name=Benzine/> During the [[Urabi revolt]], some Muslim mobs had misguidedly attacked a number of Copts resulting from their anger against European colonialism. Abduh also had meetings in Baghdad with the son of [[Baha'ism]]'s founder and then spiritual leader, [[Abdu'l Baha]], who he had a generally positive view of - although it was asserted by his students that he was unaware of the extra-Quranic religious scripture or status of [[Baha'ullah]] as a prophet in the faith and viewed it as a reformation of [[Shi'ism]].<ref>Juan R.I.

Under al-Afghani's influence, Abduh combined journalism, politics, and his own fascination in Islamic mystical spirituality. Al-Afghani taught Abduh about the problems of Egypt and the Islamic world and about the technological achievements of the [[Western world|West]].\n\nIn 1877, Abduh was granted the degree of 'Alim (\"teacher\") and he started to teach logic, theology and ethics at al-Azhar. In 1878, he was appointed professor of history at Cairo's teachers' training college [[Dar al-Ulum]], later incorporated into [[Cairo University]]. He was also appointed to teach [[Arabic]] at the Khedivial School of Languages.<ref name=KG/>\n\nAbduh was appointed editor-in-chief of ''[[Al-Waqa'i' al-Misriyya|al-Waq\u0101\u02bei\u02bf al-Mi\u1e63riyya]]'', the official state newspaper. He was dedicated to reforming all aspects of Egyptian society and believed that education was the best way to achieve this goal. He was in favor of a good religious education, which would strengthen a child\u2019s morals, and a scientific education, which would nurture a child\u2019s ability to reason. In his articles he criticized corruption, superstition, and the luxurious lives of the rich.<ref name=KG/>\n\nIn 1879, due to his political activity, [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]] was exiled and Abduh was exiled to his home village. The following year he was granted control of the national gazette and used this as a means to spread his anti-colonial ideas, and the need for social and religious reforms.<ref name=EB/> He was exiled from Egypt by the British in 1882 for six years, for supporting the Egyptian nationalist [[Urabi Revolt|revolt]] led by [[Ahmed Orabi]] in 1879. He had stated that every society should be allowed to choose a suitable form of government based on its history and its present circumstances.<ref name=KG/> Abduh spent several years in Ottoman  [[Lebanon]], where he helped establish an Islamic educational system. In 1884 he moved to [[Paris|Paris, France]] where he joined al-Afghani in publishing ''[[Al-Urwah al-Wuthqa|The Firmest Bond]]'' (al-Urwah al-Wuthqa), an Islamic revolutionary journal that promoted anti-British views.  Abduh also visited Britain and discussed the state of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] with high-ranking officials. In 1885, after brief stays in [[England]] and [[Tunisia]], he returned to [[Beirut]], as a teacher,<ref name=EB/> and was surrounded by scholars from different religious backgrounds. During his stay there he dedicated his efforts toward furthering respect and friendship between [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]].<ref name=KG/>\n\nWhen he returned to Egypt in 1888, Abduh began his legal career. He was appointed judge in the Courts of First Instance of the Native Tribunals and in 1891, he became a consultative member of the Court of Appeal.<ref name=EB/> In 1899, he was appointed [[Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah|Grand Mufti of Egypt]], the highest Islamic title, and he held this position until he died.  As a judge, he was involved in many decisions, some of which were considered liberal such as the ability to utilize meat butchered by non-Muslims and the acceptance of loan interest. His liberal views endeared him to the British, in particular [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]]; however they also caused a rift between him and the khedive [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas Hilmi]] and the nationalist leader [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]].<ref name=EB/> While he was in Egypt, Abduh founded a religious society, became president of a society for the revival of Arab sciences and worked towards reforming [[al-Azhar University]] by putting forth proposals to improve examinations, the curriculum and the working conditions for both professors and students. He travelled a great deal and met with European scholars in [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]]. He studied French law and read a great many European and Arab works in the libraries of [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]]. The conclusions he drew from his travels were that Muslims suffer from ignorance about their own religion and the despotism of unjust rulers.<ref name=KG/>\n\nMuhammad Abduh died in [[Alexandria]] on 11 July 1905.

He said that in Islam, man was not created to be led by a bridle, but that man was given intelligence so that he could be guided by knowledge. According to Abduh, a teacher\u2019s role was to direct men towards study. He believed that Islam encouraged men to detach from the world of their ancestors and that Islam reproved the slavish imitation of tradition. He said that the two greatest possessions relating to religion that man was graced with were independence of will and independence of thought and opinion. It was with the help of these tools that he could attain happiness. He believed that the growth of western civilization in Europe was based on these two principles. He thought that Europeans were roused to act after a large number of them were able to exercise their choice and to seek out facts with their minds.<ref>Gelvin , J. L. (2008). The Modern Middle East (2nd ed., pp. 161-162). New York: Oxford university Press.</ref>\nHis Muslim opponents refer to him as an infidel; however, his followers called him a sage, a reviver of religion and a reforming leader. He is conventionally graced with the epithets \u201cal-Ust\u0101dh al-Im\u0101m\u201d and \u201cal-Shaykh al-Muft\u012b\u201d.  In his works, he portrays God as educating humanity from its childhood through its youth and then on to adulthood. According to him, Islam is the only religion whose dogmas can be proven by reasoning. Abduh does not advocate returning to the early stages of Islam. He was against [[polygamy]] and thought that it was an archaic custom. He believed in a form of Islam that would liberate men from enslavement, provide equal rights for all human beings, abolish the religious scholar\u2019s monopoly on [[exegesis]] and abolish [[racial discrimination]] and religious compulsion.<ref name=KG/>\n\nAbduh regularly called for better friendship between religious communities. He made great efforts to preach harmony between [[Sunni]]s and [[Shia]]s. Broadly\nspeaking, he preached brotherhood between all schools of thought in Islam. However, he criticized what he perceived as errors such as [[superstition]]s coming from popular [[Sufism]].<ref name=Benzine>Benzine, Rachid. Les nouveaux penseurs de l'islam, p. 43-44.</ref> As Christianity was the second biggest religion in [[Egypt]], he devoted special efforts towards friendship between Muslims and Christians. He had many Christian friends and many a time he stood up to defend [[Copts]].<ref name=Benzine/> During the [[Urabi revolt]], some Muslim mobs had misguidedly attacked a number of Copts resulting from their anger against European colonialism. Abduh also had meetings in Baghdad with the son of [[Baha'ism]]'s founder and then spiritual leader, [[Abdu'l Baha]], who he had a generally positive view of - although it was asserted by his students that he was unaware of the extra-Quranic religious scripture or status of [[Baha'ullah]] as a prophet in the faith and viewed it as a reformation of [[Shi'ism]].<ref>Juan R.I.
