Detective [[Joey Quinn]] once confronts him about his behavior, stating it is the reason that no-one likes to be around him.

At Debra's request, he returns to his old self at the end of the episode, although his demeanor appears less vulgar.\n\nOne of his saving graces is his sense of personal loyalty to his colleagues. He is greatly distraught after seeing Dexter's wife [[Rita Bennett|Rita]] kiss another man, and tries to tell Dexter.\n\n==Notable events==\nIn the sixth season, he begins guiding around a group of interns, bringing them through the labs and to crime scenes. He is attracted to one of his female interns, but is forced to fire her when she steals a prosthetic forearm and hand, evidence from the Ice Truck Killer case, and sells it online. He replaces her with Louis Greene, a tech-savvy game designer who helps Masuka with database analysis. In the seventh season, however, he learns that Louis was the actual buyer of the stolen prosthesis when Dexter mails it back to Miami Metro with a letter of complaint. Masuka fires Louis on the spot.\n\nIn the eighth season, he discovers he has a daughter, Niki, who was the result of a woman using one of his sperm donations. At first, Masuka suspects that Niki is using him for his money, and even has Debra (who has quit Miami Metro and started working as a private detective) look into her past. When he learns that she works in a topless sports bar, he gets her a job as a forensics assistant at Miami Metro, allowing them to work together and get to know each other better.\n\n==Differences from the novels==\nIn both the television series and the novels, Vince is socially and emotionally awkward. In the novels, Dexter views him as a kindred spirit, believing that Masuka is also \"pretending to be human\", and asks him to serve as the best man at his wedding. In ''[[Dearly Devoted Dexter]]'', Vince throws a large bachelor party for Dexter within a few hours of finding out about his engagement, and in ''[[Dexter in the Dark]]'' takes his role as best man so seriously that he calls in favors to hire Manny Borque, a famous caterer, for Dexter's wedding.\n\nIn the novels, Dexter feels a kinship with Masuka; he senses that Masuka is also hiding who he truly is. As in the television series, Masuka sets up Dexter's [[bachelor party]] and kidnaps him to get him there (where, in the belief that he had been kidnapped by a serial killer called the Skinner, Dexter slugs him in the eye just as he opens the car trunk).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Dexter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Masuka, Vince}}\n[[Category:Dexter (series) characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional forensic scientists]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2004]]\n[[Category:Characters in American novels of the 21st century]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Japanese descent]]\n", "text_old": "{{in-universe|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #F0E68C\n| name               = '''Vince Masuka'''\n| series             = ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]''\n| image              = Vince Masuka.jpg\n| image_size         = 250px\n| first              = '''Book Series''': <br /> ''[[Darkly Dreaming Dexter]]'' <br /> '''TV Series''': <br /> ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' <br />''Pilot episode'': \"[[Dexter (episode)|Dexter]]\"\n| last               = '''Television''':<br> \"[[Remember the Monsters?]]\"<br> (episode 8.12)\n| creator            = [[Jeff Lindsay (writer)|Jeff Lindsay]]\n| portrayer          = [[C.

The film premiered on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2018; becoming the network's most popular program of the holiday season and the second-highest rated fictional program of the year.<ref name=Bhavnani>{{cite web|last1=Bhavnani|first1=Sanjeev|title=Channel 5 delivers best ever ABC1 ratings in 2018|url=https://advanced-television.com/2019/01/02/channel-5-delivers-best-ever-abc1-ratings-in-2018/|website=Advanced Television|date=January 2, 2019|accessdate=6 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot uses elements of classic detective novels, and also contains references to Christie's novels, such as ''[[The Man in the Brown Suit]]'', the title of which appears as a headline in a newspaper clipping.  The murder of Florence Nightingale Shore, and the character of Mabel Rogers, are based on real people and events.<ref name=\"tnsm\">{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=Rosemary |title=The Nightingale Shore Murder |publisher=Troubador |isbn=9781784624040}}</ref>\n\nIn 1926, Agatha Christie finds herself in a difficult place when her writing is thwarted by predictable plot lines and her unfaithful husband pushes her for a divorce she does not want. As she searches for an alternative creative route to revive her novel development, she is approached by a woman, Mabel Rogers, seeking help in solving the murder of her partner, Florence Nightingale Shore, who had been bludgeoned on a train. Though initially reluctant to facilitate a private investigation, Christie goes undercover while the nation searches for her whereabouts. She soon finds herself taken to a new story with real characters and tangible danger.\n\nCalling herself \"Mary Westmacott\" (an early Christie pseudonym), she gathers all the suspects in the attack in a country house under the pretext of determining their share of a large inheritance from a fictitious American businessman, with herself as the representative of a law firm and Mabel acting as housekeeper and cook.  The suspects include Daphne Miller, a young woman whose nursing career Florence could have ruined if she had lived, Randolph, Florence's cousin who inherited her money, Zaki Hanachi, a French soldier of African ancestry who she helped recover after the war, and who may have been asking her for money, Travis Pickford, a boxer and black marketer who was interviewed by the police, and Mrs. Pamela Rose, the woman Florence was travelling to see.  Daphne is accompanied by her abusive father Wade, and Mrs. Rose by her son Franklin.  Mabel is able to search the guests' bags, and finds that Wade Miller may have a pistol with him.  To try and force a reaction from the others, \"Mary\" announces after the first interview that Daphne will get the biggest share of the inheritance.\n\nEvents take a harrowing turn when Daphne's father is shot dead.  Detective Inspector Dicks arrives with a single constable, complaining that he is shorthanded because of the hunt for Agatha Christie, and that because of this he must conduct the investigation at the house instead of the police station.  It is quickly discovered that they have been gathered together under false pretenses, and \"Mary\" changes her story to suit.  Mabel is found in possession of the murder weapon and arrested.  Dicks reveals to \"Mary\" that he knows that she is Agatha Christie.  He also knows that Daphne shot her father, based on an injury to her hand from the recoil of the automatic pistol.  Christie, having found a vital detail in Florence's diary, tells him she knows who attacked Florence, and asks for his help.  They spring a trap to get the real killers to admit their involvement.  Even after Dicks and others overhear the conversation, the evidence is too thin to convict them, despite there being proof that they wrote a note blackmailing Daphne into planting the gun in Mabel's room.  Instead, the others conspire to frame Florence's killers for the murder of Daphne's father.\n\nInspector Dicks helps Christie set up the cover story for her disappearance and inadvertently helps her get the idea for a new book.  She is shown later completing a manuscript which is implied to be \"Death on the Nile\", though this was published some years later.\n\n==References to other works==\nChristie is shown reading a bedtime book to her daughter Rosalind.  The book is the play ''[[R.U.R.]]'' by Karel Capek, a work credited with introducing the word ''robot'' into the English language.\n==References to real people and events==\nAgatha Christie initially consults [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] for advice in overcoming her problems with writing.  He responds that he found that designing golf courses helped him.  She tries to follow this advice, but after discouraging and patronising responses from other men, including her husband, she turns to Mabel's case instead.\n\nArriving at the country house, Agatha complains that her car broke down and she was forced to take a bad train ride, arriving later than intended.  Christie's car was in fact found abandoned near a chalk pit near [[Guildford]] outside London.\n\nBoth Florence Nightingale Shore and Mabel Rogers were based on real people.  Florence was attacked on the London to Brighton express in 1920 and died four days later.  Mabel, with whom she shared a house, testified that some of her rings were missing from her body.  Witnesses described a \"man in a brown suit\" getting into the same compartment.  The character of Travis resembles a man detained in possession of a blood-stained revolver at Dover.  Author Rosemary Cook, in her book \"The Nightingale Shore Murder\" (Troubador, 2015)<ref name=\"tnsm\"/>, speculated that Christie knew of the crime and used elements of it in ''[[The Man in the Brown Suit]]'', which describes a murder on the London Underground.\n\nCousin Randolph may have been partly based on Raffaele Farina, the first cousin of Nightingale Shore who served as Head of Russian Section at Mi5 (G4 Branch) between August 1918 and February 1921. In real life, Florence would visit Farina's mother, the \u2018Baroness Farina\u2019 in Tonbridge the evening prior to the attack on the train. Baroness Maretta Robina Farina (n\u00e9e Leishmann) was Florence's aunt, the sister of her mother, Anna Marie Leishmann. Florence's cousin would later play a role in the distribution of the infamous [[Zinoviev Letter]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.monocledmutineer.co.uk/nightingale-shore-truth-murder/|title=Florence

Murder''' is a 2018 British [[alternative history]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] film about crime writer [[Agatha Christie]] becoming embroiled in a real-life murder case during her 11-day disappearance in 1926.<ref name=Jackson>{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Lorne|title=TV review: Agatha & the Truth of

Written by Tom Dalton, it depicts Christie investigating the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]] ([[Florence Nightingale Shore]]) and how her involvement in this case influenced her subsequent writing. The film premiered on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2018; becoming the network's most popular program of the holiday season and the second-highest rated fictional program of the year.<ref name=Bhavnani>{{cite web|last1=Bhavnani|first1=Sanjeev|title=Channel 5 delivers best ever ABC1 ratings in 2018|url=https://advanced-television.com/2019/01/02/channel-5-delivers-best-ever-abc1-ratings-in-2018/|website=Advanced Television|date=January 2, 2019|accessdate=6 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot uses elements of classic detective novels, and also contains references to Christie's novels, such as ''[[The Man in the Brown Suit]]'', the title of which appears as a headline in a newspaper clipping.  The murder of Florence Nightingale Shore, and the character of Mabel Rogers, are based on real people and events.<ref name=\"tnsm\">{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=Rosemary |title=The Nightingale Shore Murder |publisher=Troubador |isbn=9781784624040}}</ref>\n\nIn 1926, Agatha Christie finds herself in a difficult place when her writing is thwarted by predictable plot lines and her unfaithful husband pushes her for a divorce she does not want. As she searches for an alternative creative route to revive her novel development, she is approached by a woman, Mabel Rogers, seeking help in solving the murder of her partner, Florence Nightingale Shore, who had been bludgeoned on a train. Though initially reluctant to facilitate a private investigation, Christie goes undercover while the nation searches for her whereabouts. She soon finds herself taken to a new story with real characters and tangible danger.\n\nCalling herself \"Mary Westmacott\" (an early Christie pseudonym), she gathers all the suspects in the attack in a country house under the pretext of determining their share of a large inheritance from a fictitious American businessman, with herself as the representative of a law firm and Mabel acting as housekeeper and cook.  The suspects include Daphne Miller, a young woman whose nursing career Florence could have ruined if she had lived, Randolph, Florence's cousin who inherited her money, Zaki Hanachi, a French soldier of African ancestry who she helped recover after the war, and who may have been asking her for money, Travis Pickford, a boxer and black marketer who was interviewed by the police, and Mrs. Pamela Rose, the woman Florence was travelling to see.  Daphne is accompanied by her abusive father Wade, and Mrs. Rose by her son Franklin.  Mabel is able to search the guests' bags, and finds that Wade Miller may have a pistol with him.  To try and force a reaction from the others, \"Mary\" announces after the first interview that Daphne will get the biggest share of the inheritance.\n\nEvents take a harrowing turn when Daphne's father is shot dead.  Detective Inspector Dicks arrives with a single constable, complaining that he is shorthanded because of the hunt for Agatha Christie, and that because of this he must conduct the investigation at the house instead of the police station.  It is quickly discovered that they have been gathered together under false pretenses, and \"Mary\" changes her story to suit.  Mabel is found in possession of the murder weapon and arrested.  Dicks reveals to \"Mary\" that he knows that she is Agatha Christie.  He also knows that Daphne shot her father, based on an injury to her hand from the recoil of the automatic pistol.  Christie, having found a vital detail in Florence's diary, tells him she knows who attacked Florence, and asks for his help.  They spring a trap to get the real killers to admit their involvement.  Even after Dicks and others overhear the conversation, the evidence is too thin to convict them, despite there being proof that they wrote a note blackmailing Daphne into planting the gun in Mabel's room.  Instead, the others conspire to frame Florence's killers for the murder of Daphne's father.\n\nInspector Dicks helps Christie set up the cover story for her disappearance and inadvertently helps her get the idea for a new book.  She is shown later completing a manuscript which is implied to be \"Death on the Nile\", though this was published some years later.\n\n==References to other works==\nChristie is shown reading a bedtime book to her daughter Rosalind.  The book is the play ''[[R.U.R.]]'' by Karel Capek, a work credited with introducing the word ''robot'' into the English language.\n==References to real people and events==\nAgatha Christie initially consults [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] for advice in overcoming her problems with writing.  He responds that he found that designing golf courses helped him.  She tries to follow this advice, but after discouraging and patronising responses from other men, including her husband, she turns to Mabel's case instead.\n\nArriving at the country house, Agatha complains that her car broke down and she was forced to take a bad train ride, arriving later than intended.  Christie's car was in fact found abandoned near a chalk pit near [[Guildford]] outside London.\n\nBoth Florence Nightingale Shore and Mabel Rogers were based on real people.  Florence was attacked on the London to Brighton express in 1920 and died four days later.  Mabel, with whom she shared a house, testified that some of her rings were missing from her body.  Witnesses described a \"man in a brown suit\" getting into the same compartment.  The character of Travis resembles a man detained in possession of a blood-stained revolver at Dover.  Author Rosemary Cook, in her book \"The Nightingale Shore Murder\" (Troubador, 2015)<ref name=\"tnsm\"/>, speculated that Christie knew of the crime and used elements of it in ''[[The Man in the Brown Suit]]'', which describes a murder on the London Underground.\n\nCousin Randolph may have been partly based on Raffaele Farina, the first cousin of Nightingale Shore who served as Head of Russian Section at Mi5 (G4 Branch) between August 1918 and February 1921. In real life, Florence would visit Farina\u2019s mother, the \u2018Baroness Farina\u2019 in Tonbridge the evening prior to the attack on the train. Baroness Maretta Robina Farina (n\u00e9e Leishmann) was Florence\u2019s aunt, the sister of her mother, Anna Marie Leishmann. Florence\u2019s cousin would later play a role in the distribution of the infamous [[Zinoviev Letter]] <ref>{{cite

Unlike the European rabbit, they do not form social burrow systems, but compared with some other [[leporid]]s, they are extremely tolerant of other individuals in their vicinity.\n\nCottontails give birth to their kits in burrows vacated by other mammals. They sometimes cool off, or take refuge in scratched out shallow created depressions of their own making, using their front paws like a back hoe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/species/cotton/|title=Desert Cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii)|website=tpwd.texas.gov|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611100626/http://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/species/cotton/|archive-date=2017-06-11|url-status=|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref> They are not usually active in the middle of the day, but can be observed foraging in the early morning, and early evening. Cottontails are rarely found out of their burrows looking for food on windy days, because the wind interferes with their ability to hear approaching predators, their primary defense mechanism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/rabbit-info2.htm |title=Rabbits and Hares |access-date=2015-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731024801/http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/rabbit-info2.htm |archive-date=2015-07-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe dental formula for ''Sylvilagus audubonii'' is {{DentalFormula|upper=2.0.3.3|lower=1.0.3.3}}= 28.<ref name=\":1\" /> All species under the family Leporidae have the same dental formula.\n\n==Lifespan==\n[[File:Cottontail age comparison-2.jpg|thumb|left|Male desert cottontail at 8 weeks, and the same specimen at 16 months of age]]\n[[File:Desert Cottontail on hind legs begging.jpg|thumb|Submissive posture anticipating food]]\n\nThe lifespan of a cottontail that reaches adulthood averages less than two years, depending on the location.<ref>{{cite web |title=Desert cottontail |url=http://www.nsrl.ttu.edu/tmot1/sylvaudu.htm |publisher=Natural Science Research Laboratory, Museum of Texas Tech University |accessdate=27 June 2017}}</ref> Unfortunately for the cottontail, almost every local [[carnivore]] larger or faster than the [[Lagomorpha|lagomorph]] is its predator. Some predators, like [[snake]]s for example, are familiar with the area inhabited by the cottontails, and can catch and eat the young at will; the mother is unable to defend the litter. Although cottontails are highly active sexually, and mated pairs have multiple litters throughout the year, few young survive to adulthood. Those that survive grow quickly and are full grown at three months.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sylvilagus floridanus |url=http://www.psu.edu/dept/nkbiology/naturetrail/speciespages/cottontail.htm |date=2002}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe desert cottontail is quite similar in appearance to the [[European rabbit]], though its ears are larger and are more often carried erect.

etc.).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turkowski|first=Frank J.|date=October 1975|title=Dietary Adaptability of the Desert Cottontail|jstor=3800237|journal=The Journal of Wildlife

nutrients as effectively as possible.<ref name=\"NDOW\" />\n\nThe desert cottontail, like all cottontails, eats on all fours. It can only use its nose to move and adjust the position of the food that it places directly in front of its front paws on the ground. The cottontail turns the food with its nose to find the cleanest part of the vegetation (free of sand and inedible parts) to begin its meal. The only time a cottontail uses its front paws to enable eating is when vegetation is above its head on a living plant. The cottontail then lifts a paw to bend the branch and bring the food within reach.<ref>{{cite web |title=Small mammals |url=http://www.jeffersoncountytrails.org/news-signs/SmallMammals2OCT11.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Thermoregulation ===\nDue to the variable temperature of living conditions, desert cottontails must be adequate [[Thermoregulation|thermoregulators]] to minimize water loss during the hotter seasons and require shaded areas of their environment to conduct evaporative water loss through thermal heat transfer. In open-desert areas, they can withstand for a short period with extremely high temperatures of around  45&nbsp;\u00b0C and have a large evaporative water loss capacity of around 1.5% body mass/hour, though cottontails can withstand longer in an ideal environment with shaded areas. To cope with evaporative heat loss, they do panting and undergo changes in production of their basal metabolic rate in relation to the ambient temperature of the environment.

Unlike the European rabbit, they do not form social burrow systems, but compared with some other [[leporid]]s, they are extremely tolerant of other individuals in their vicinity.\n\nCottontails give birth to their kits in burrows vacated by other mammals. They sometimes cool off, or take refuge in scratched out shallow created depressions of their own making, using their front paws like a back hoe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/species/cotton/|title=Desert Cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii)|website=tpwd.texas.gov|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611100626/http://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/species/cotton/|archive-date=2017-06-11|url-status=|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref> They are not usually active in the middle of the day, but can be observed foraging in the early morning, and early evening. Cottontails are rarely found out of their burrows looking for food on windy days, because the wind interferes with their ability to hear approaching predators, their primary defense mechanism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/rabbit-info2.htm |title=Rabbits and Hares |access-date=2015-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731024801/http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/rabbit-info2.htm |archive-date=2015-07-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe dental formula for ''Sylvilagus audubonii'' is {{DentalFormula|upper=2.0.3.3|lower=1.0.3.3}}= 28.<ref name=\":1\" /> All species under the family Leporidae have the same dental formula.\n\n==Lifespan==\n[[File:Cottontail age comparison-2.jpg|thumb|left|Male desert cottontail at 8 weeks, and the same specimen at 16 months of age]]\n[[File:Desert Cottontail on hind legs begging.jpg|thumb|Submissive posture anticipating food]]\n\nThe lifespan of a cottontail that reaches adulthood averages less than two years, depending on the location.<ref>{{cite web |title=Desert cottontail |url=http://www.nsrl.ttu.edu/tmot1/sylvaudu.htm |publisher=Natural Science Research Laboratory, Museum of Texas Tech University |accessdate=27 June 2017}}</ref> Unfortunately for the cottontail, almost every local [[carnivore]] larger or faster than the [[Lagomorpha|lagomorph]] is its predator. Some predators, like [[snake]]s for example, are familiar with the area inhabited by the cottontails, and can catch and eat the young at will; the mother is unable to defend the litter. Although cottontails are highly active sexually, and mated pairs have multiple litters throughout the year, few young survive to adulthood. Those that survive grow quickly and are full grown at three months.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sylvilagus floridanus |url=http://www.psu.edu/dept/nkbiology/naturetrail/speciespages/cottontail.htm |date=2002}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe desert cottontail is quite similar in appearance to the [[European rabbit]], though its ears are larger and are more often carried erect.

etc.).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turkowski|first=Frank J.|date=October 1975|title=Dietary Adaptability of the Desert Cottontail|jstor=3800237|journal=The Journal of Wildlife

nutrients as effectively as possible.<ref name=\"NDOW\" />\n\nThe desert cottontail, like all cottontails, eats on all fours. It can only use its nose to move and adjust the position of the food that it places directly in front of its front paws on the ground. The cottontail turns the food with its nose to find the cleanest part of the vegetation (free of sand and inedible parts) to begin its meal. The only time a cottontail uses its front paws to enable eating is when vegetation is above its head on a living plant. The cottontail then lifts a paw to bend the branch and bring the food within reach.<ref>{{cite web |title=Small mammals |url=http://www.jeffersoncountytrails.org/news-signs/SmallMammals2OCT11.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Thermoregulation ===\nDue to the variable temperature of living conditions, desert cottontails must be adequate [[Thermoregulation|thermoregulators]] to minimize water loss during the hotter seasons and require shaded areas of their environment to conduct evaporative water loss through thermal heat transfer. In open-desert areas, they can withstand for a short period with extremely high temperatures of around  45&nbsp;\u00b0C and have a large evaporative water loss capacity of around 1.5% body mass/hour, though cottontails can withstand longer in an ideal environment with shaded areas. To cope with evaporative heat loss, they do panting and undergo changes in production of their basal metabolic rate in relation to the ambient temperature of the environment. Ears of desert cottontails make up 14% of their body size and may help with thermoregulation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hinds|first=David S.|date=August 1973|title=Acclimatization of Thermoregulation in the Desert Cottontail, Sylvilagus audubonii|jstor=1378969|journal=American Society of Mammalogists|volume=54|issue=3|pages=708\u2013728}}</ref>\n\n===  Predators and threats ===\n\n[[File:What's Up Doc.jpg|thumb|left|[[High Desert (California)|California High Desert]] cottontail on alert for predators]]\n\nMany desert animals prey on cottontails, including [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], [[mustelid]]s, the [[coyote]], the [[bobcat]], [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[mountain lion]]s, [[snake]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[human]]s, and even [[squirrel]]s, should a cottontail be injured or docile from illness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/wildlife/rabbit/eastern-cottontail.asp |title=Eastern Cottontail |access-date=2013-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129223018/http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/wildlife/rabbit/eastern-cottontail.asp |archive-date=2013-01-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Alien species, such as [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s, are also known predators, and also pose a threat.<ref name=\":0\" /> Southwestern [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] hunted them for meat but also used their fur and hides.

It also features [[David Pevsner]] as [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Ebenezer \"Ben\" Scrooge]], [[Tim Kazurinsky]] as the ghost of Scrooge's business partner [[Jacob Marley]], [[Ronnie Kroell]] as the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]], [[Megan Cavanagh]] as the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]], [[David Moretti]] as [[Bob Cratchit]], and JoJo Baby as the [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come|Ghost of Christmas Future]]. The film adaptation received a mixed critical reception.\n\n==Plot==\nA gay successful [[piano bar]] owner [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Ebenezer \"Ben\" Scrooge]] ([[David Pevsner]]) despises Christmas and other people; he also mistreats and underpays his employees. One night, Scrooge encounters the ghost of [[Jacob Marley]] ([[Tim Kazurinsky]])\u2014who died ten years before the film\u2014in chains, warning him that Scrooge would have the same fate in afterlife as Marley's and that the three Spirits will visit him.\n\nAfter he goes to sleep, Scrooge encounters the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] ([[Ronnie Kroell]]), who transports him to the 1970s. There, they see Ben's father (Michael Joseph Mitchell) kicking Young Ben (Drew Anderson) out of the house after seeing Ben make love to one of his male classmates. Four months later, Young Ben befriends a young disco club employee [[Jacob Marley]] (Nicholas Bailey) and is hired by the club owner [[Mr. Fezziwig|Fezziwig]], who treats him like a son. Young Ben develops a relationship with Bill (Christopher Allen), whom he met at Fezziwig's club. On Ben and Bill's first Christmas season together, Ben's close sister Franny (Allison Torem) dies after giving birth to her daughter Freda. Then Ben's father sends him a letter instructing him not to visit or honor the family, distressing Ben. For comfort, Ben and Bill declare their love for each other. Over the years, Ben, Jacob and Fezziwig become co-owners of the club and expand their business; however, Ben and Bill's relationship becomes strained when Ben increasingly focuses more on his career and money and neglects Bill. In the mid-1980s, Ben and Jacob trick Fezziwig into transferring his business to them and then kick Fezziwig out. Outraged about Fezziwig's fate and having enough, Bill ends the relationship with Ben, upsetting Ben. Eventually, Bill dies of AIDS in 1987, yet Ben refuses to visit him when Bill was dying or to mourn him.\n\nAfter Ben finishes revisiting the past, the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] ([[Megan Cavanaugh]]) transports him to his niece Freda's ([[Rusty Schwimmer]]) house, where she and her partner Mary (Amy Matheny) gather a Christmas Eve party, and then various places where other people celebrate the holidays, including a scene where Fezziwig solitarily celebrates Christmas in his apartment. Then they transport to the house of one of Scrooge's overworked and underpaid employees [[Bob Cratchit]] ([[David Moretti]]), whose health care proposal for employees Scrooge refused, where Bob lives with his male partner and their adopted children, including an ill child [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]] (Liam Jones). After they transport back to Scrooge's home, feeling sympathy, Scrooge asks about Tiny Tim's fate. She replies, \"We all will die. Nothing can be done without assistance.\"\n\nThen the [[Ghost of Christmas Future]] (JoJo Baby) covered in a black robe transports him to a bleak future Christmas, where everyone is glad about his death, a gay center whose donation offer Scrooge refused earlier is financially struggling and close to shutting down, and his possessions are stolen and then sold to pawn shops. Then the spirit transports Scrooge to the Cratchit home, where the family mourn Tiny Tim's death, and then to the scene of Scrooge's death and his tombstone inscribed: \"E. Scrooge\".\n\nThen Scrooge sobs and promises that he will change while he is transported back to his home on the present Christmas Day. Happy to return, Scrooge remembers putting away Bill's letter, written on the day of their breakup, and then reads it, saying that when Ben finds [[Grace in Christianity|grace]], Bill forgives him and declares his love for him. On the afternoon, Scrooge anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner, donates money to the gay center, spends a Christmas dinner with Freda and Mary, gives his employees bonuses, promotes Bob as a business partner, gives Bob a pay raise, and accepts Bob's health care proposal. Some time later, Scrooge honors his deceased lover Bill, takes care of Fezziwig with a motorized wheelchair, is a dedicated uncle to Freda and Mary's baby, becomes Tiny Tim's father figure, and starts another relationship, illustrating his kept promise to the Spirits. After the end credits roll, the chains loosen from Marley's ghost resulting from visiting and haunting Scrooge, i.e. helping others to help oneself, a loophole that he learned at the beginning of the film.\n\n==Production==\nThe filming occurred in [[Chicago]] in May 2012.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite magazine |first=Frank |last=Schneck |date=2012-11-26 |df=mdy |title=''Scrooge & Marley'': Film Review |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/scrooge-marley-film-review-393968 |magazine=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=December 1, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://camelottheatres.com/2012/11/06/scrooge-marley-its-a-christmas-carol-gone-gay/ |title=''Scrooge & Marley'' \u2013 'It\u2019s ''A Christmas Carol'' Gone Gay' |website=Camelot Theatres |date=2012-11-06 |df=mdy |accessdate=December 1, 2018 }}</ref> The film was partially crowdfunded through an [[Indiegogo]] campaign, which ended on August 15 of the same year.<ref name=\"Windy\">{{cite press release |title=Judith Light to Narrate ''Scrooge & Marley'' Film |url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Judith-Light-to-narrate-Scrooge-Marley-film/39112.html |website=Windy City Times |date=2012-08-15 |df=mdy |accessdate=December 2, 2018 }}</ref> One of Chicago's film critics Richard Knight Jr.<ref name=\"Huffpost\">{{cite interview |first=Richard Jr. |last=Knight |date=2012-03-07 |df=mdy |title=Chicago Filmmakers at Work on a Gay Twist on ''A Christmas Carol'' |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/07/chicago-filmmakers-at-wor_n_1327361.html |interviewer=Joseph Erbentraut |website=Huffpost |accessdate=December 2, 2018 }}</ref> and Peter Neville co-directed the film adaptation.

The film adaptation received a mixed critical reception.\n\n==Plot==\nA gay successful [[piano bar]] owner [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Ebenezer \"Ben\" Scrooge]] ([[David Pevsner]]) despises Christmas and other people; he also mistreats and underpays his employees. One night, Scrooge encounters the ghost of [[Jacob Marley]] ([[Tim Kazurinsky]])\u2014who died ten years before the film\u2014in chains, warning him that Scrooge would have the same fate in afterlife as Marley's and that the three Spirits will visit him.\n\nAfter he goes to sleep, Scrooge encounters the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] ([[Ronnie Kroell]]), who transports him to the 1970s. There, they see Ben's father (Michael Joseph Mitchell) kicking Young Ben (Drew Anderson) out of the house after seeing Ben make love to one of his male classmates. Four months later, Young Ben befriends a young disco club employee [[Jacob Marley]] (Nicholas Bailey) and is hired by the club owner [[Mr. Fezziwig|Fezziwig]], who treats him like a son. Young Ben develops a relationship with Bill (Christopher Allen), whom he met at Fezziwig's club. On Ben and Bill's first Christmas season together, Ben's close sister Franny (Allison Torem) dies after giving birth to her daughter Freda. Then Ben's father sends him a letter instructing him not to visit or honor the family, distressing Ben. For comfort, Ben and Bill declare their love for each other. Over the years, Ben, Jacob and Fezziwig become co-owners of the club and expand their business; however, Ben and Bill's relationship becomes strained when Ben increasingly focuses more on his career and money and neglects Bill. In the mid-1980s, Ben and Jacob trick Fezziwig into transferring his business to them and then kick Fezziwig out. Outraged about Fezziwig's fate and having enough, Bill ends the relationship with Ben, upsetting Ben. Eventually, Bill dies of AIDS in 1987, yet Ben refuses to visit him when Bill was dying or to mourn him.\n\nAfter Ben finishes revisiting the past, the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] ([[Megan Cavanaugh]]) transports him to his niece Freda's ([[Rusty Schwimmer]]) house, where she and her partner Mary (Amy Matheny) gather a Christmas Eve party, and then various places where other people celebrate the holidays, including a scene where Fezziwig solitarily celebrates Christmas in his apartment. Then they transport to the house of one of Scrooge's overworked and underpaid employees [[Bob Cratchit]] ([[David Moretti]]), whose health care proposal for employees Scrooge refused, where Bob lives with his male partner and their adopted children, including an ill child [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]] (Liam Jones). After they transport back to Scrooge's home, feeling sympathy, Scrooge asks about Tiny Tim's fate. She replies, \"We all will die. Nothing can be done without assistance.\"\n\nThen the [[Ghost of Christmas Future]] (JoJo Baby) covered in a black robe transports him to a bleak future Christmas, where everyone is glad about his death, a gay center whose donation offer Scrooge refused earlier is financially struggling and close to shutting down, and his possessions are stolen and then sold to pawn shops. Then the spirit transports Scrooge to the Cratchit home, where the family mourn Tiny Tim's death, and then to the scene of Scrooge's death and his tombstone inscribed: \"E. Scrooge\".\n\nThen Scrooge sobs and promises that he will change while he is transported back to his home on the present Christmas Day. Happy to return, Scrooge remembers putting away Bill's letter, written on the day of their breakup, and then reads it, saying that when Ben finds [[Grace in Christianity|grace]], Bill forgives him and declares his love for him. On the afternoon, Scrooge anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner, donates money to the gay center, spends a Christmas dinner with Freda and Mary, gives his employees bonuses, promotes Bob as a business partner, gives Bob a pay raise, and accepts Bob's health care proposal. Some time later, Scrooge honors his deceased lover Bill, takes care of Fezziwig with a motorized wheelchair, is a dedicated uncle to Freda and Mary's baby, becomes Tiny Tim's father figure, and starts another relationship, illustrating his kept promise to the Spirits. After the end credits roll, the chains loosen from Marley's ghost resulting from visiting and haunting Scrooge, i.e. helping others to help oneself, a loophole that he learned at the beginning of the film.\n\n==Production==\nThe filming occurred in [[Chicago]] in May of 2012.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite magazine |first=Frank |last=Schneck |date=2012-11-26 |df=mdy |title=''Scrooge & Marley'': Film Review |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/scrooge-marley-film-review-393968 |magazine=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=December 1, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://camelottheatres.com/2012/11/06/scrooge-marley-its-a-christmas-carol-gone-gay/ |title=''Scrooge & Marley'' \u2013 'It\u2019s ''A Christmas Carol'' Gone Gay' |website=Camelot Theatres |date=2012-11-06 |df=mdy |accessdate=December 1, 2018 }}</ref> The film was partially crowdfunded through an [[Indiegogo]] campaign, which ended on August 15 of the same year.<ref name=\"Windy\">{{cite press release |title=Judith Light to Narrate ''Scrooge & Marley'' Film |url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Judith-Light-to-narrate-Scrooge-Marley-film/39112.html |website=Windy City Times |date=2012-08-15 |df=mdy |accessdate=December 2, 2018 }}</ref> One of Chicago's film critics Richard Knight Jr.<ref name=\"Huffpost\">{{cite interview |first=Richard Jr. |last=Knight |date=2012-03-07 |df=mdy |title=Chicago Filmmakers at Work on a Gay Twist on ''A Christmas Carol'' |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/07/chicago-filmmakers-at-wor_n_1327361.html |interviewer=Joseph Erbentraut |website=Huffpost |accessdate=December 2, 2018 }}</ref> and Peter Neville co-directed the film adaptation.

He's also an opportunistic thief. Ekaj decides to go into prostitution out of desperation. Mecca becomes ill, as his medication does not really seem to be working for him. At the same time we see Ekaj becoming stronger and less vulnerable. He ends up falling in love with a painter named \"Johnny\" (Scooter LaForge) who has no tolerance and is constantly beating him. Johnny seems indifferent and cold towards Ekaj's desperate love and obsession for him.

In later interviews, he mentioned his father's alcoholism as the reason for the breakdown of their marriage.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Soon after the split, his father moved to [[Livno]], taking Goran's younger brother Predrag with him while Goran remained living with his mother in Sarajevo, visiting his father and brother every summer in Livno.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Their father soon retired and eventually moved back to his home village in Zagorje while Goran's brother Predrag later moved back to Sarajevo for university studies.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/>\n\nGoran played violin in a [[music school]]. However, deemed untalented, he was thrown out during second grade. His musical education was thus reduced to what his friend taught him until Goran's mother bought him his first guitar in his early teens. Bregovi\u0107 wanted to enroll in a fine arts high school, but his aunt told his mother that it was supposedly full of homosexuals, which precipitated his mother's decision to send him to a technical (traffic) school. As a compromise for not getting his way, she allowed him to grow his hair long.\n\n==Early career==\nUpon entering high school, teenage Bregovi\u0107 joined the school band Izohipse where he began on bass guitar. Soon, however, he was kicked out of that school too (this time for misbehavior \u2013 he crashed into a school-owned [[Mercedes-Benz]]). Bregovi\u0107 then entered grammar school and its school band Be\u0161tije (again as a bass guitar player). When he was 16, his mother left him and moved to the coast, meaning that other than having a few relatives to rely on, he mostly had to take care of himself. He did that by playing [[folk music]] in a [[kafana]] in [[Konjic]], working on construction sites, and selling newspapers.\n\nSpotting him at a Be\u0161tije gig in 1969, [[\u017deljko Bebek]] invited eighteen-year-old Bregovi\u0107 to play bass guitar in his band [[Kodeksi]], which Goran gladly accepted.\n\n===Kodeksi===\n{{main|Kodeksi}}\nEventually, Kodeksi shifted setup so Bregovi\u0107 moved from bass to lead guitar, resulting in Kodeksi having the following line-up during summer 1970: Goran Bregovi\u0107, \u017deljko Bebek, [[Zoran Red\u017ei\u0107]] and [[Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107]]. All of them would eventually become members of [[Bijelo Dugme]] at some point in the future. At the time, they were largely influenced by [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Black Sabbath]]. During the fall of 1970, this resulted in the departure of \u017deljko Bebek, who (both as rhythm guitar player and singer) got phased out of the band. At the end of the year, Goran's mother and Zoran's brother arrived in [[Naples]] and took them back to [[Sarajevo]].\n\n===Jutro===\n{{main|Jutro}}\nThen, in the autumn of 1971, Bregovi\u0107 enrolled at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Faculty of Philosophy, studying philosophy and sociology. He soon quit, however. At the same time, [[Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107]] left for London, so Bregovi\u0107 formed a band with Nuno Arnautali\u0107 called [[Jutro]] (Morning), which Red\u017ei\u0107 soon joined as well. Over the next few years, the band changed lineups frequently, and on 1 January 1974 modified its name to [[Bijelo Dugme]] (\"White Button\").\n\n==Bijelo Dugme==\n[[File:Bregovic - portret - 1980.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bregovi\u0107 in 1980 during Bijelo Dugme's new wave phase.]]\n{{main|Bijelo Dugme}}\nFrom 1974 until 1989, Bregovi\u0107 played lead guitar and was the main creative force behind [[Bijelo Dugme]] (''White Button''). For years they stood as one of the most popular bands in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]. From the get-go, he established himself as the band's undisputed leader as well as its public face in the Yugoslav print and electronic media. \n\nOver the band's fifteen-year run, in addition to their enormous popularity at home, led by Bregovi\u0107, Bijelo Dugme made several attempts at expanding their prominence abroad. In late 1975, while recording their second album ''[[\u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu]]'' in [[London]], they additionally recorded an [[English language]] track called \"Playing the Part\" (translated version of their [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] track \"\u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu\", itself an uncredited cover of [[Argent (band)|Argent]]'s 1972 track \"I Am the Dance of Ages\") that was packaged as a [[promo single]] for English music journalists. Never officially released for mass distribution, the track quickly fell into oblivion. \n\nBijelo Dugme had somewhat better luck with touring abroad, which almost entirely took place in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries as part of their respective [[cultural exchange]] programs with SFR Yugoslavia. The band briefly toured the [[Polish People's Republic]] during April 1977, a 9-concert leg as part of the tour in support of their third album ''[[Eto!

Assigned to a unit based in [[Ni\u0161]], he would spend the following year away from music, a period during which the band was on hiatus.\n\nDuring early 1982, the band played in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] as representatives of the city of [[Sarajevo]] and SFR Yugoslavia, the site of the upcoming [[Winter Olympics]], as part of an event bringing together past and future Winter Olympic hosts.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005\">{{cite news|last=Vesi\u0107|first=Du\u0161an|url=https://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:277218-Tezga-u-Bugarskoj|title=Tezga u Bugarskoj|agency=''[[Ve\u010dernje novosti]]''|date=11 June 2005|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> On return to Yugoslavia from Innsbruck, the band had its equipment confiscated by the Yugoslav customs after [[customs declaration|undeclared]] musical equipment was found among their luggage.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005\"/> Some six months after that, during summer 1982, Bijelo Dugme went on a tour of the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], playing 41 shows throughout the country from 15 July until 31 August 1982.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005\"/> Despite the tour in support of their latest studio album ''[[Do\u017eivjeti stotu]]'' being over for more than a year, and having no new material to promote, the band reportedly accepted the tour of Bulgaria in order to recover some of the funds lost after getting fined by the Yugoslav customs over the attempt to bring undeclared musical equipment into the country.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005\"/> \n\nIn summer 1985, following a decade of continuous rejection for tours of the [[Soviet Union]] by the cultural [[attach\u00e9]] of the Soviet embassy in Yugoslavia, Bijelo Dugme was finally scheduled to play in [[Moscow]] on 28 July 1985 at a huge open-air concert at [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Gorky Park]] on the same bill with another Yugoslav act [[Bajaga i Instruktori]] as part of the [[12th World Festival of Youth and Students|12th]] [[World Festival of Youth and Students]].<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-jun-2005\">{{cite news|last=Vesi\u0107|first=Du\u0161an|url=https://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:277220-Skandal-u-Moskvi|title=Skandal u Moskvi|agency=''[[Ve\u010dernje novosti]]''|date=13 June 2005|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> Ahead of the show, Bregovi\u0107 decided to take the band to [[Budva]] for two weeks in order to practice for the Moscow appearance, an indication of the seriousness with which they approached this particular concert.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-jun-2005\"/> However, due to [[overcrowding]] and safety concerns, the event got interrupted around 10 pm after the Bajaga i Instruktori set before Bijelo Dugme even took the stage.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-jun-2005\"/> Instead at Gorky Park, Bijelo Dugme played the Dynamo Arena on the Moscow outskirts two days later at noon on 30 July 1985.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-jun-2005\"/>\n\n===Guest appearances, collaborations, and business venture===\nIn between Bijelo Dugme's studio releases and tours, in-demand Bregovi\u0107 worked on various side projects in Yugoslavia. These included releasing a [[Goran Bregovi\u0107 (album)|solo record]] in 1976 and composing two movie soundtracks \u2014 1977's ''Leptirov oblak'' and 1979's ''Li\u010dne stvari''. \n\nHe also tried his hand at music production, producing [[Idoli]]'s 1980 seven-inch single \"[[Malj\u010diki]]\" / \"[[Retko te vi\u0111am sa devojkama]]\" and co-producing, alongside [[Kornelije Kova\u010d]], [[Zdravko \u010coli\u0107]]'s fourth studio album ''[[Malo poja\u010daj radio]]'' in 1981. \n\nBregovi\u0107 furthermore made guest appearances on guitar on various studio recordings by different Yugoslav pop, folk, and rock acts: [[Neda Ukraden]]'s track \"Tri djevojke\" (together with Bijelo Dugme bandmates [[Vlado Pravdi\u0107]] and [[Zoran Red\u017ei\u0107]]) off her 1976 album ''Ko me to od nekud doziva'', [[Hanka Paldum]]'s track \"Zbog tebe\" off her 1980 album ''[[\u010ce\u017enja (album)|\u010ce\u017enja]]'', \"Ne da/ne nego i/ili\" track by [[Kozmetika]] off their 1983 [[Kozmetika (album)|eponymous album]], Valentino's track \"Pazi na ritam\" off their 1983 debut album ''ValentiNo1'', [[Riblja \u010corba]]'s track \"Disko mi\u0161i\u0107\" off their 1985 album ''[[Istina]]'', [[Dino Merlin|Merlin]]'s 1986 album ''[[Te\u0161ko meni sa tobom (a jo\u0161 te\u017ee bez tebe)]]'', Mjese\u010dari track \"Gdje izlazi\u0161 ovih dana\" off their 1988 album ''One \u0161etaju od 1 do 2'', and [[Piloti (band)|Piloti]] track \"Tiho, tiho\" off their 1990 album ''Nek te Bog \u010duva za mene''.\n\nDuring his time leading Bijelo Dugme, Bregovi\u0107 also became involved in the financial and organizational side of the [[music industry|music business]].

His first project was [[Emir Kusturica]]'s ''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'' (1989). This turned out to be a great success (both the film and the soundtrack). Goran and Emir's collaboration continued, and Goran composed music (which was performed by [[Iggy Pop]]) for Emir's next film ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' (1993). During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Goran lived in Paris, but he also lived in Belgrade. His next major project, music for [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]]'s ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|Queen Margot]]'' was a great success as well, and as a result, the film won two awards on the 1994 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The next year's [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] award went to ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'', for which Goran Bregovi\u0107 composed the music.\n\nIn 1997, he worked with Turkish singer [[Sezen Aksu]] on her album ''D\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn ve Cenaze'' (''Wedding and Funeral''). After that album, he continued making composite albums with other musicians that were based on his music and singers' lyrics.\n\nHe made an album with [[George Dalaras]] in 1999 named ''[[Thessaloniki \u2013 Yannena with Two Canvas Shoes]]''. In the same year, Bregovi\u0107 recorded an album called ''[[Kayah i Bregovi\u0107]]'' (Kayah and Bregovi\u0107) with popular Polish singer [[Kayah (singer)|Kayah]] which sold over 700,000 copies in [[Poland]] (seven times platinum record).\n\nIn 2001, he recorded another album with another Polish singer, [[Krzysztof Krawczyk (singer)|Krzysztof Krawczyk]], titled \"Daj mi drugie \u017cycie\" (\"Give Me Second Life\").\n\nIn 2005, Bregovi\u0107 took part in three large farewell concerts of Bijelo Dugme.\n\nA number of works created by Bregovi\u0107 can be heard on the soundtrack to the 2006 film ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]], most notably \"\u0110ur\u0111evdan\". The film itself actually features more Bregovi\u0107 samples than the soundtrack. \n\nTwo musical numbers by Bregovi\u0107, \"Ne Siam Kurve Tuke Sijam Prostitutke,\" and \"Gas, Gas\" were featured in the soundtrack of the 2012 Brazilian telenovela, ''[[Salve Jorge]]'', on the television network [[Rede Globo]].<ref name=\"Salve Jorge Tracklist\">{{cite web|title=Salve Jorge (Trilha Sonora da Novela) [|url=http://musica.com.br/trilhas-sonoras/salve-jorge.html|publisher=Musica.com.br|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Wedding and Funeral Orchestra===\n[[Image:Goran Bregovic in Tbilisi, Georgia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bregovi\u0107 in concert in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia on 3 October 2007.]]\nFor many years Bregovi\u0107 performed with a large ensemble of musicians: a brass band, bagpipes, a string ensemble, a tuxedo-clad all-male choir from [[Belgrade]], women wearing traditional Bulgarian costumes, and [[Romani people|Roma]] singers make up his 40-piece band and orchestra.\n\nSince 1998, and until about 2012, Bregovi\u0107 has been performing his music mainly in the form of concerts all over the world with his Wedding and Funeral Orchestra.

After Bijelo Dugme split up, he started composing film scores. Among his better known film scores are three of [[Emir Kusturica]]'s films (''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'', ''[[Arizona Dream]]'', and ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]''). For Time of the Gypsies, Bregovi\u0107 won a [[Golden Arena for Best Film Music|Golden Arena Award]] at the [[Pula Film Festival]] in 1990, among other awards. He had also composed for the [[Academy Award]]-nominated film ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|La Reine Margot]]'' and the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]]-entered film ''[[The Serpent's Kiss]]''.\n\nBregovi\u0107, during his five-decade long career, has composed for critically acclaimed singers, including [[Sezen Aksu]], [[Kayah (singer)|Kayah]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[\u0160aban Bajramovi\u0107]], [[George Dalaras]] and [[Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Sarajevo]], [[People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|PR Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]] to a [[Croats|Croat]] father Franjo Bregovi\u0107 and [[Serbs|Serb]] mother Borka Peri\u0161i\u0107,<ref>[http://www.yurope.com/nasa-borba/arhiva/Maj97/1805/1805_15.HTM Strogo kontrolisano disidentstvo];''Na\u0161a Borba'', 18 May 1997</ref><ref>http://www.goranbregovic.rs/biography/</ref> Goran grew up with two younger siblings \u2014 sister Dajana and brother Predrag. Their father was from the Croatian region of [[Zagorje]], specifically [[Sveti Petar \u010cvrstec]] village near [[Kri\u017eevci, Croatia|Kri\u017eevci]], while their mother was born in [[Virovitica]] to parents that had shortly before her birth arrived in the nearby village of [[\u010cemernica, Croatia|\u010cemernica]], settling there from the village of [[Kazanci]] near [[Gacko]] in eastern [[Herzegovina]]. Goran's maternal grandfather, fought in the [[Royal Serbian Army]] at the [[Macedonian front|Salonica Front]] during [[World War I]] and as a reward received land in [[Slavonia]] where he soon moved his family.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\">{{cite news|last1=Gruji\u0107|first1=Nenad|last2=Nik\u010devi\u0107|first2=Tamara|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=1090566|title=Cigani, juri\u0161!|agency=[[Vreme]]|date=27 December 2012|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nGoran's parents met shortly after [[World War II]] in Virovitica where his mother Borka lived and his father Franjo (who fought on the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] side during the war) attended a [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) military school.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Franjo Bregovi\u0107 soon got his first job, teaching [[ballistics]] at a military school in Sarajevo, so the couple that at the time moved there.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Goran, their first child, was born in 1950 in Sarajevo.\n\nGoran was 10 years old when his parents divorced. In later interviews, he mentioned his father's alcoholism as the reason for the breakdown of their marriage.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Soon after the split, his father moved to [[Livno]], taking Goran's younger brother Predrag with him while Goran remained living with his mother in Sarajevo, visiting his father and brother every summer in Livno.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Their father soon retired and eventually moved back to his home village in Zagorje while Goran's brother Predrag later moved back to Sarajevo for university studies.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/>\n\nGoran played violin in a [[music school]]. However, deemed untalented, he was thrown out during second grade. His musical education was thus reduced to what his friend taught him until Goran's mother bought him his first guitar in his early teens. Bregovi\u0107 wanted to enroll in a fine arts high school, but his aunt told his mother that it was supposedly full of homosexuals, which precipitated his mother's decision to send him to a technical (traffic) school. As a compromise for not getting his way, she allowed him to grow his hair long.\n\n==Early career==\nUpon entering high school, teenage Bregovi\u0107 joined the school band Izohipse where he began on bass guitar. Soon, however, he was kicked out of that school too (this time for misbehavior \u2013 he crashed into a school-owned [[Mercedes-Benz]]). Bregovi\u0107 then entered grammar school and its school band Be\u0161tije (again as a bass guitar player). When he was 16, his mother left him and moved to the coast, meaning that other than having a few relatives to rely on, he mostly had to take care of himself. He did that by playing [[folk music]] in a [[kafana]] in [[Konjic]], working on construction sites, and selling newspapers.\n\nSpotting him at a Be\u0161tije gig in 1969, [[\u017deljko Bebek]] invited eighteen-year-old Bregovi\u0107 to play bass guitar in his band [[Kodeksi]], which Goran gladly accepted.\n\n===Kodeksi===\n{{main|Kodeksi}}\nEventually, Kodeksi shifted setup so Bregovi\u0107 moved from bass to lead guitar, resulting in Kodeksi having the following line-up during summer 1970: Goran Bregovi\u0107, \u017deljko Bebek, [[Zoran Red\u017ei\u0107]] and [[Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107]]. All of them would eventually become members of [[Bijelo Dugme]] at some point in the future. At the time, they were largely influenced by [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Black Sabbath]]. During the fall of 1970, this resulted in the departure of \u017deljko Bebek, who (both as rhythm guitar player and singer) got phased out of the band. At the end of the year, Goran's mother and Zoran's brother arrived in [[Naples]] and took them back to [[Sarajevo]].\n\n===Jutro===\n{{main|Jutro}}\nThen, in the autumn of 1971, Bregovi\u0107 enrolled at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Faculty of Philosophy, studying philosophy and sociology. He soon quit, however. At the same time, [[Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107]] left for London, so Bregovi\u0107 formed a band with Nuno Arnautali\u0107 called [[Jutro]] (Morning), which Red\u017ei\u0107 soon joined as well. Over the next few years, the band changed lineups frequently, and on 1 January 1974 modified its name to [[Bijelo Dugme]] (\"White Button\").\n\n==Bijelo Dugme==\n[[File:Bregovic - portret - 1980.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bregovi\u0107 in 1980 during Bijelo Dugme's new wave phase.]]\n{{main|Bijelo Dugme}}\nFrom 1974 until 1989, Bregovi\u0107 played lead guitar and was the main creative force behind [[Bijelo Dugme]] (''White Button''). For years they stood as one of the most popular bands in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]. From the get-go, he established himself as the band's undisputed leader as well as its public face in the Yugoslav print and electronic media. \n\nOver the band's fifteen-year run, in addition to their enormous popularity at home, led by Bregovi\u0107, Bijelo Dugme made several attempts at expanding their prominence abroad. In late 1975, while recording their second album ''[[\u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu]]'' in [[London]], they additionally recorded an [[English language]] track called \"Playing the Part\" (translated version of their [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] track \"\u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu\", itself an uncredited cover of [[Argent (band)|Argent]]'s 1972 track \"I Am the Dance of Ages\") that was packaged as a [[promo single]] for English music journalists. Never officially released for mass distribution, the track quickly fell into oblivion. \n\nBijelo Dugme had somewhat better luck with touring abroad, which almost entirely took place in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries as part of their respective [[cultural exchange]] programs with SFR Yugoslavia. The band briefly toured the [[Polish People's Republic]] during April 1977, a 9-concert leg as part of the tour in support of their third album ''[[Eto!

His first project was [[Emir Kusturica]]'s ''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'' (1989). This turned out to be a great success (both the film and the soundtrack). Goran and Emir's collaboration continued, and Goran composed music (which was performed by [[Iggy Pop]]) for Emir's next film ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' (1993). During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Goran lived in Paris, but he also lived in Belgrade. His next major project, music for [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]]'s ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|Queen Margot]]'' was a great success as well, and as a result, the film won two awards on the 1994 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The next year's [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] award went to ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'', for which Goran Bregovi\u0107 composed the music.\n\nIn 1997, he worked with Turkish singer [[Sezen Aksu]] on her album ''D\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn ve Cenaze'' (''Wedding and Funeral''). After that album, he continued making composite albums with other musicians that were based on his music and singers' lyrics.\n\nHe made an album with [[George Dalaras]] in 1999 named ''[[Thessaloniki \u2013 Yannena with Two Canvas Shoes]]''. In the same year, Bregovi\u0107 recorded an album called ''[[Kayah i Bregovi\u0107]]'' (Kayah and Bregovi\u0107) with popular Polish singer [[Kayah (singer)|Kayah]] which sold over 700,000 copies in [[Poland]] (seven times platinum record).\n\nIn 2001, he recorded another album with another Polish singer, [[Krzysztof Krawczyk (singer)|Krzysztof Krawczyk]], titled \"Daj mi drugie \u017cycie\" (\"Give Me Second Life\").\n\nIn 2005, Bregovi\u0107 took part in three large farewell concerts of Bijelo Dugme.\n\nA number of works created by Bregovi\u0107 can be heard on the soundtrack to the 2006 film ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]], most notably \"\u0110ur\u0111evdan\". The film itself actually features more Bregovi\u0107 samples than the soundtrack. \n\nTwo musical numbers by Bregovi\u0107, \"Ne Siam Kurve Tuke Sijam Prostitutke,\" and \"Gas, Gas\" were featured in the soundtrack of the 2012 Brazilian telenovela, ''[[Salve Jorge]]'', on the television network [[Rede Globo]].<ref name=\"Salve Jorge Tracklist\">{{cite web|title=Salve Jorge (Trilha Sonora da Novela) [|url=http://musica.com.br/trilhas-sonoras/salve-jorge.html|publisher=Musica.com.br|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Wedding and Funeral Orchestra===\n[[Image:Goran Bregovic in Tbilisi, Georgia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bregovi\u0107 in concert in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia on 3 October 2007.]]\nFor many years Bregovi\u0107 performed with a large ensemble of musicians: a brass band, bagpipes, a string ensemble, a tuxedo-clad all-male choir from [[Belgrade]], women wearing traditional Bulgarian costumes, and [[Romani people|Roma]] singers make up his 40-piece band and orchestra.\n\nSince 1998, and until about 2012, Bregovi\u0107 has been performing his music mainly in the form of concerts all over the world with his Wedding and Funeral Orchestra.

She is going out with Victor Sender, a doctor working in the same hospital. Victor is deeply involved in a project that employs electro-shock therapy in violent criminals in an effort to turn them into model citizens.\n\nCrime is rampant in the city. There has been a number of unresolved killings of young men which have been attributed to a serial killer believed to be a sadistic homosexual. A family is getting ready to watch Stanley Kubrick's  ''A Clockwork Orange'' on television  when they are assaulted by a gang of delinquents who knock at their door. The assailants, wearing red helmets, leather biker's outfits, and handling bullwhips smash the modern looking apartment. They rape both husband and wife but leave the couple's young son unharmed. After their crime, there is a dispute among the four members of the gang. One gang member, David, is beaten up and expelled from the group.\n\nAnna is a pop art collector. She is the highest bidder in an auction of [[Alex Raymond]]\u2019s artwork for [[Flash Gordon]]. At the auction, she gives her phone number to her bidder rival, Toni, a young man with a handicapped leg. Anna lives alone in a large mansion on the outskirts of the city where Toni comes to see her. After they have sex, Anna listens to Toni\u2019s heartbeats while he sleeps and stabs him to death with a surgical scalpel. She disposes of Toni's body in a river, but she has been secretly observed by David. He finds out Anna's information through her car\u2019s number plate and begins to follow her.\nWearing a wig and dressed matronly, Anna seduces Bruno, a narcissistic underwear model, who she has seen on TV commercials. She takes him home and kills him. His body falls next to the book Anna was reading: [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s novel \"Lolita\".\n\nAlthough Anna is still going out with Victor, she rebuffs his romantic advances. Dressed in drag, Anna enters a gay bar where she picks up Roman Mendoza, a gay man who she takes home. After dancing a [[waltz]], Anna proposes to have sex. He is initially hesitant. He thought she was a lesbian. He had never had sex with a woman before, but he is game. While Anna was out, David entered her house after befriending the [[German Shepherd]] that guarded her property. Hiding behind curtains, David witnesses Anna seducing the young gay man and sees her stab him in the heart.\n\nBroken glass inside her house alerts Anna that there is an intruder. When she looks outside she sees David playing with her dogs behind the mansion fence. Anna, pretending to be a maid, befriends David and invites him in. When she is going to start her pre-murder routine, David shows her the surgical scalpel used by Anna to kill her victims. She has been hiding it inside a music box. David does not want to denounce her to the police, but he begins to blackmail her instead. Through their monetary transactions, David begins to arouse Anna's personal interest. David buys a motorcycle with the money, but the members of his former gang, who believe he has stolen a bounty from them, pursue him and leave him badly beaten. David is taken to the hospital where Anna works. Since David was a violent criminal in the past, Victor wants to experiment on him the electro-shock therapy to turn killers like David into \u201cuseful citizens\u201d. Anna is moved when she finds out that David is now her patient. She is not going to allow Victor to use David for his experiments. At night on New Year's Eve, Anna reads a poem by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] to David. When Victor arrives he finds Anna covered in David's blood after she killed him. In another room, the criminal patients in Victor's experiment go berserk, savagely killing each other.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Sue Lyon]]  as Ana Vernia\n*[[Christopher Mitchum]] as David\n*[[Jean Sorel]] as Dr. Victor Sender\n*[[Ram\u00f3n Pons]] as Toni\n*Charly Bravo as Bruno\n*Alfredo Alba as Rom\u00e1n Mendoza\n*Antonio del Real as Mick\n*David Carpenter as Phil\n*Ram\u00f3n Tejela as Nicola\n\n==Alternative titles==\nThe original Spanish title ''Una gota de sangre para morir amando'' translates as ''A Drop of Blood to Die Loving'' and the film was theatrically released in France as ''Le bal du vaudou'' and in the United States as ''To Love, Perhaps to Die'' with the latter title a closer translation of the Spanish.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Summers |first1=Claude J. |title=The Queer Encyclopedia of Film & Television |date=3 November 2005 |publisher=Cleis Press Inc. |location=San Francisco, California |isbn=1573442097 |page=180 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yrgUAQAAIAAJ&q |accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Dyer |first1=Richard |title=Lethal Repetition: Serial Killing in European Cinema |date=25 November 2015 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |isbn=9781844573936 |page=227 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nSBdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref> In the mid-1980s Empire Video released the film on UK VHS as ''Clockwork Terror'' in an attempt to sell it almost as a sequel to ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and its following British video and DVD releases were titled ''Murder in a Blue World'' in reference to the fictional Blue Drink featured in the film.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kerekes |first1=David |title=Headpress: Journal of Sex, Religion, Death, Issues 18-20 |date=May 2000 |publisher=Headpress |location=Manchester |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Qf8pAQAAIAAJ&dq |accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=L\u00e1zaro-Reboll |first1=Antonio |title=Spanish Horror Film |date=20 November 2012 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=9780748636402 |page=146 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NwirBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref>\n==Analizes==\nThe film takes some cues from [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' to the extent that it was even released on 1980s UK VHS as ''Clockwork Terror''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=L\u00e1zaro-Reboll |first1=Antonio |title=Spanish Horror Film |date=20 November 2012 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=9780748636402 |page=146 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NwirBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref> Like its inspiration source the film is set in a near-future dystopian world where sadistic gangs attack, rape and steal from innocent people on the streets and in their homes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mira |first1=Alberto |last2=Gubern |first2=Rom\u00e1n |title=The Cinema of Spain and Portugal |date=2005 |publisher=Wallflower Press |location=London |isbn=1904764444 |pages=165-166 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oboxWAqj37UC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref> To elaborate the film plays on the Ludovico Technique of its predecessor as a neo-Fascist government tries to fight these crimes by conducting sinister mind-control experiments on captured criminals.

She is going out with Victor Sender, a doctor working in the same hospital. Victor is deeply involved in a project that employs electro-shock therapy in violent criminals in an effort to turn them into model citizens.\n\nCrime is rampant in the city. There has been a number of unresolved killings of young men which have been attributed to a serial killer believed to be a sadistic homosexual. A family is getting ready to watch Stanley Kubrick's  ''A Clockwork Orange'' on television  when they are assaulted by a gang of delinquents who knock at their door. The assailants, wearing red helmets, leather biker\u2019s outfits, and handling bullwhips smash the modern looking apartment. They rape both husband and wife but leave the couple\u2019s young son unharmed. After their crime, there is a dispute among the four members of the gang. One gang member, David, is beaten up and expelled from the group.\n\nAnna is a pop art collector. She is the highest bidder in an auction of [[Alex Raymond]]\u2019s artwork for [[Flash Gordon]]. At the auction, she gives her phone number to her bidder rival, Toni, a young man with a handicapped leg. Anna lives alone in a large mansion on the outskirts of the city where Toni comes to see her. After they have sex, Anna listens to Toni\u2019s heartbeats while he sleeps and stabs him to death with a surgical scalpel. She disposes of Toni's body in a river, but she has been secretly observed by David. He finds out Anna's information through her car\u2019s number plate and begins to follow her.\nWearing a wig and dressed matronly, Anna seduces Bruno, a narcissistic underwear model, who she has seen on TV commercials. She takes him home and kills him. His body falls next to the book Anna was reading: [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s novel \"Lolita\".\n\nAlthough Anna is still going out with Victor, she rebuffs his romantic advances. Dressed in drag, Anna enters a gay bar where she picks up Roman Mendoza, a gay man who she takes home. After dancing a [[waltz]], Anna proposes to have sex. He is initially hesitant. He thought she was a lesbian. He had never had sex with a woman before, but he is game. While Anna was out, David entered her house after befriending the [[German Shepherd]] that guarded her property. Hiding behind curtains, David witnesses Anna seducing the young gay man and sees her stab him in the heart.\n\nBroken glass inside her house alerts Anna that there is an intruder. When she looks outside she sees David playing with her dogs behind the mansion fence. Anna, pretending to be a maid, befriends David and invites him in. When she is going to start her pre-murder routine, David shows her the surgical scalpel used by Anna to kill her victims. She has been hiding it inside a music box. David does not want to denounce her to the police, but he begins to blackmail her instead. Through their monetary transactions, David begins to arouse Anna's personal interest. David buys a motorcycle with the money, but the members of his former gang, who believe he has stolen a bounty from them, pursue him and leave him badly beaten. David is taken to the hospital where Anna works. Since David was a violent criminal in the past, Victor wants to experiment on him the electro-shock therapy to turn killers like David into \u201cuseful citizens\u201d.
