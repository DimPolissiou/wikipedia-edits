In 1928, Eagle, now 125 stores strong, merged with [[Kroger]]. The three families agreed to stay out of the grocery business for at least three years.\n\nMeanwhile, the Moravitz and Weizenbaum families built their own successful chain of grocery stores named OK Grocery. In 1931, OK Grocery merged with Eagle Grocery to form Giant Eagle, which was incorporated two years later. Giant Eagle quickly expanded across western Pennsylvania, weathering the Great Depression and World War II.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gianteagle.net/Article.aspx?cntid=178046 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528062541/http://www.gianteagle.net/Article.aspx?cntid=178046 |archivedate=2013-05-28 }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:GiantEagleStowOhio.jpg|thumb|right|234px|Giant Eagle in [[Stow, Ohio]]. This is the current Giant Eagle prototype, used since the late 1990s, but has the 1980s-era Giant Eagle logo font.]]\nThe chain remained based solely in western Pennsylvania until the 1980s, when it bought [[Youngstown, Ohio]]-based wholesaler Tamarkin Company, and its Valu-King stores that were converted to the Giant Eagle name. The [[Kent, Ohio|Kent]] and [[Ravenna, Ohio|Ravenna]] stores were the first to be converted at that time; the Youngstown stores then got converted years later. Around the mid- or late 1990s, Giant Eagle later reached [[Cleveland]] by acquiring the Stop-n-Shop stores in the area. Stop-n-Shop stores were family owned and operated in different areas of Cleveland. The family operators of Stop-n-Shop formed a holding company named International Seaway Foods as the main umbrella for Stop-n-Shop. In 1998, Giant Eagle acquired the International Seaway Foods and converted the Stop-n-Shop Stores into Giant Eagle Stores. Giant Eagle also purchased or opened other [[Northeast Ohio]] stores outside the Stop-n-Shop area, such as the former Apples supermarkets in the nearby [[Akron, Ohio]] area.\n\nThe company entered the [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] market, opening two stores in 2001 and 2004, both of which have now closed. Giant Eagle emerged as one of the dominant supermarket chains in Northeast Ohio, competing mainly against the New York-based [[Tops Markets, LLC|Tops]], from which it purchased 18 stores in October 2006. The purchases came as Tops exited the Northeast Ohio area.\n\nGiant Eagle purchased independently owned [[County Market]] stores, giving it a store in [[Somerset, Pennsylvania]], a new store in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], and its first Maryland stores: one in [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], one in [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]], and two in [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]]. The Cumberland store closed in December 2003, and the Hagerstown store closed in August 2005. \n\nGiant Eagle has aggressively expanded its footprint in the Greater [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] area, capitalizing on the demise of the former [[Big Bear (supermarket)|Big Bear]] supermarket chain, and taking Big Bear's traditional place as Columbus's upmarket grocer. Giant Eagle first entered what it calls its \"Columbus Region\" in late 2000, opening three large newly built stores at Sawmill and Bethel Rd., Lewis Center, and Dublin-Granville Rd., with two more following in 2002 and 2003 at Gahanna and Hilliard-Rome Rd. The Hilliard-Rome Rd. location closed in early 2017. In 2004, Giant Eagle purchased nine former Big Bear stores in Columbus, Newark, and Marietta from parent company [[Penn Traffic]]. Giant Eagle has since expanded to several additional locations, acquiring other abandoned Big Bear stores and in newly constructed buildings using the current Giant Eagle prototype. Giant Eagle opened its 20th Columbus-area at New Albany Road at the Ohio Rt. 161 freeway (New Albany) in August 2007, its 21st area store at Hayden Run and Cosgray Roads (Dublin) in November 2007, its 22nd area store at Stelzer and McCutcheon Roads (Columbus) in July 2008 and its 23rd area store at South Hamilton Road and Winchester Pike [[Groveport, Ohio|(Groveport)]] in August 2008. A new Giant Eagle opened in [[Lancaster, Ohio|Lancaster]], in November 2008, and the former Big Bear located at Blacklick Crossing is undergoing an expansion and remodeling.\n\nOn September 27, 2018, Giant Eagle announced it would purchase the [[Ricker's]] convenience store chain in Indiana, marking the largest acquisition for GetGo since the chain's launch. It is not known if the Ricker's chain will be integrated into the GetGo brand following the closure of the deal.<ref>https://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/indianapolis/giant-eagle-to-acquire-56-rickers-convenience-stores-across-indiana</ref> Much as it has done in Pennsylvania alongside [[Sheetz]], GetGo plans to join Ricker's in having Indiana change their laws regarding alcohol sales.<ref>http://www.heraldbulletin.com/business/ricker-s-stores-to-be-sold-to-giant-eagle-supermarket/article_45885136-c276-11e8-99e8-c70b929361ac.html</ref>\n\n==Loyalty program==\n\nIn 1991, Giant Eagle introduced the \"Advantage Card\", an electronic [[loyalty card]] discount system (already popular in many chains), as a sophisticated version of the obsolete stamp programs. The card was later modified to double as a video rental card for Iggle Video. More recently the company has started the Fuelperks! program to entice customers. This program allows customer the opportunity to earn 10 cents off each gallon of gas (20 cents in select markets) with fifty dollars' worth of authorized purchases. In early 2009, Giant Eagle launched the Foodperks! program, mainly geared towards GetGo. This program allows customers who use their fuelperks! at GetGo to also earn foodperks! to save on groceries purchased at Giant Eagle. Every 10 gallons of gas purchased earns a 1% discount. This can be used up to 20% maximum at a time on a purchase of up to $300. Foodperks! are valid for 90 days and fuelperks! are valid for 60 days. If the customer has more than the price of gasoline or more than the 20%, those discounts will stay on their card for the remainder of the 90/60 days, and if they are not used by then, they expire. In February 2013, Giant Eagle announced that they would be discontinuing the foodperks! program that month because it was \"a little too complex\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Schmitz|first=Jon|title=Giant Eagle will end foodperks! grocery rewards program|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/business/news/giant-eagle-will-end-foodperks-grocery-rewards-program-673291/|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=February 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Giant Eagle began implementing fuelperks+, an enhancement to the existing fuelperks program that reintroduces the benefits of the previous foodperks benefit which had been discontinued in 2013. Under the new fuelperks+ program, customers earn one perk per dollar spent at Giant Eagle, Market District or GetGo stores. Also, customers can earn five perks for every prescription filled at Giant Eagle or Market District. At GetGo, customers earn two perks per gallon of gas. Once 50 perks is reached, customers can choose between 2% off on groceries (maximum discount 20% off or $10,000) or 10 cents off each gallon of gas (up to 30 free gallons per one vehicle). As in the previous fuelperks! program, if customers have more than the price of gasoline or more than the 20%, those discounts will remain on their Advantage Card for the remainder of the 60 day time period.<ref>https://account.gianteagle.com/fuelperks-plus/perksvideo/?return=ge</ref>\n\n==Operations==\n[[File:Giant Eagle footprint.png|250px|thumb|right|Map of Giant Eagle stores]]\n\nThere are 221 store and GetGo locations in the United States: 99 in western [[Pennsylvania]], 122 in central, northeastern, and eastern [[Ohio]], two in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], [[West Virginia]], two in [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], [[Maryland]] and one in [[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]], [[Indiana]]. Each store carries between 22,000 and 60,000 items, approximately 5,000 of which are branded by Giant Eagle.\n\nGiant Eagle offers more than two dozen departments across its stores. The range of services includes [[Redbox]] video terminals, dry cleaning, in-store day care, and pharmacies. Giant Eagle also has [[bank]]ing partnerships with [[Citizens Financial Group|Citizens Bank]] in Pennsylvania and [[Huntington Bancshares|Huntington Bank]] in Ohio and West Virginia, both of which have their branches open inside Giant Eagle branches seven days a week except for federal holidays.\n\nThe chain has built large prototypes, and it has experimented with many departments unusual to supermarkets. Larger stores feature vast selections of ethnic and organic food, dry cleaning services, Iggle video, drive-thru pharmacies, in-store banking, Eagle's Nest (for daycare purposes while shopping), as well as in-store coffee shops and prepared foods. Prepared foods are also sold at larger GetGo locations that can accommodate a GetGo Kitchen.\n\nAlthough older Giant Eagle locations tend to be [[trade union|unionized]] and some are even [[franchising|franchised]] stores, in recent years the company has started leaning toward non-union company-owned and -operated stores. In areas where a franchised store exists, if a [[GetGo]] exists nearby, it's operated by Giant Eagle itself, separate from the franchised supermarket.\n\n===Current brands===\n\n====Market District====\n[[File:Giant Eagle Market District at the Kingsdale Shopping Center.jpg|thumb|right|Giant Eagle Market District in [[Upper Arlington, Ohio]]]]\n\nGiant Eagle rebranded some of its stores as '''Market District''' in an attempt to attract upscale shoppers. The initial two stores opened in June 2006 in the [[Shadyside (Pittsburgh)|Shadyside]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh, and [[Bethel Park, Pennsylvania|Bethel Park]], just outside Pittsburgh.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.popcitymedia.com/devnews/marketdist.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-05-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717011528/http://www.popcitymedia.com/devnews/marketdist.aspx |archive-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Giant Eagle name appears above the logo on the rebranded stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://camera-phone-fun.blogspot.com/2006/06/yeah.html |title=Blogger: Aanmelden |publisher=Camera-phone-fun.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-03}}</ref> There are now 13 stores under this brand. The 14th store is now open in the Cleveland suburb of Westlake, Ohio. That store is a result of Giant Eagle's closing their existing Westlake location in October 2018 for six months to do extensive renovations.<ref>https://www.pjpnewspapers.com/west-life/news/westlake-giant-eagle-to-close-for-six-months-for-major/article_152b2128-d313-11e8-8fc5-1fbd2152ee69.html</ref>\n\n====Giant Eagle Express====\n[[File:GiantEagleExpress.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Giant Eagle Express in [[Harmar Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Harmar Township, Pennsylvania]]]]\n\nGiant Eagle Express is a concept store. As of May 2016, the only operating store is in [[Harmar Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Harmar Township, Pennsylvania]]. An [[Indiana, Pennsylvania]] location closed its doors in 2015. The store is larger than a GetGo, but much smaller than a regular Giant Eagle supermarket store. However, the store offers many of the same services as a Giant Eagle, such as a deli and a drive-through pharmacy. Giant Eagle Express also offers a [[caf\u00e9]] with prepared sandwiches, Giant Eagle's own Market District coffee, salad bar, and a wireless internet connection. There is also a GetGo gas station.<ref>[http://www.gianteagleexpress.com/Article.aspx?cntid=39 The Express Experience] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816232025/http://www.gianteagleexpress.com/Article.aspx?cntid=39 |date=2007-08-16 }}, 30 May 2007.</ref>\n\n====Market District Express====\n\nOn June 4, 2013, Giant Eagle announced new Market District Express concept, which is designed to be a hybrid of the flagship Market District format launched in 2006 with the Giant Eagle Express format that was launched in 2007.

Giant Eagle Pharmacy also offers several immunizations throughout the year for [[pneumonia]], [[influenza]], and [[Shingrix]]. These are typically walk-in, but vary depending on the pharmacists available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gianteagle.com/Pharmacy/Pharmacy-Services/Immunizations/ |title=Immunizations - Pharmacy Services - Pharmacy & Wellness |publisher=Giant Eagle |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2013-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118075859/http://gianteagle.com/Pharmacy/Pharmacy-Services/Immunizations/ |archivedate=2013-01-18 }}</ref>\n\n====Giant Eagle Contact Lenses====\n\nGiant Eagle partnered with Arlington Lens Supply in 2010 to sell contact lenses online via their website.\n\n====Ricker Oil Company, Inc.====\n{{Main|GetGo}}\n\n'''Ricker's''' is a 56-chain, Indiana-based [[convenience store]] and gas station chain purchased by Giant Eagle in 2018.\n\n====Starbucks====\n\nGiant Eagle has a contract to operate [[Starbucks]] kiosks in some of its stores; the workers are employed by Giant Eagle, but become certified baristas after completing the process.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Defunct brands===\n\n====Phar-Mor====\n{{main|Phar-Mor}}\n\nGiant Eagle was the largest shareholder of the [[Phar-Mor]] chain during its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s, although it was operated separate from the main Giant Eagle chain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19910424&id=zHMdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_mMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2559,4515592|title=The Pittsburgh Press - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> The Shapira family who owns Giant Eagle provided Phar-Mor founder [[Michael I. Monus|Mickey Monus]] with the financing necessary to start his chain. After Monus was convicted of [[embezzlement]], Phar-Mor filed for bankruptcy and eventually liquidated. Due to Giant Eagle's stake in Phar-Mor, it was able to acquire Phar-Mor's Youngstown-area assets in bankruptcy court after the chain liquidated.\n\n====Iggle Video====\n\nGiant Eagle once operated Iggle Video locations inside many of its locations to serve as its [[video rental shop]]. Like Giant Eagle Pharmacy, Iggle Video (which spelled \"eagle\" from its phonetic pronunciation in [[Pittsburgh English|Pittsburghese]], even outside of Pittsburgh) never operated in stand-alone locations. Like other video rental chains, Iggle Video offered movie and video game rentals. They also served as the local [[Ticketmaster]] outlet in the Pittsburgh region before the advent of the Internet made it possible to buy live event tickets from Ticketmaster online. In the mid- to late 2000s, Giant Eagle phased these stores out in favor of [[Redbox]] [[automated retail]] machines, with Ticketmaster sales moved to the customer service desk.\n\n====Giant Eagle Optical====\n\nIn October 2004, Giant Eagle began a [[long-term experiment]] with in-store optometry centers dubbed \"Giant Eagle Optical\". There were four locations in the Pittsburgh area: North Hills (McIntyre Square), South Hills (Donaldson's Crossroads), east (Monroeville), and west (Robinson). The stores accepted most major vision plans and offered a wide variety of designer frames, as well as exclusive Giant Eagle brands. They also participated in the Fuelperks! program and were staffed mostly by ABO-certified opticians. Noting that \"some programs don't prove viable across a broad number of stores\", Giant Eagle chose to close its Optical locations beginning in August 2009.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09226/990741-28.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Giant Eagle ends optical, shop-scan services | first=Teresa F. | last=Lindeman | date=2009-08-14}}</ref>\n\n====Valu King and Good Cents====\n[[Image:Valuking.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Valu King logo]]\n[[File:Valu King 1989 Logo.jpg|thumb|right|Valu King 1989]]\n\nIn December 2008, Giant Eagle opened the rebranded Valu King supermarket in Eastlake, Ohio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/business/2008/12/valu_king_food_market_opens_in.html|title=Valu King Food Market opens in Eastlake|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> The Valu King name dates back to the 1980s, when Giant Eagle bought Youngstown wholesaler Tamarkin Co. and its original Valu King stores were eventually converted to the Giant Eagle name. The rebranded Valu King operated stores in [[Eastlake, Ohio|Eastlake]], [[Ravenna, Ohio|Ravenna]], and [[Brooklyn, Ohio|Brooklyn]] in [[Ohio]] and [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]] and [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] in [[Pennsylvania]], with the most recent store opened in May 2012.\n\nIn 2012, Giant Eagle opened a new low-cost supermarket concept called Good Cents, located in [[Ross Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Ross Township, Pennsylvania]]. The concept is similar to that of a Valu King, but carries a slightly larger product selection. Good Cents eventually replaced all rebranded Valu King as Giant Eagle's low-cost brand.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lindeman|first=Teresa|title=Good Cents, Giant Eagle's new low-price grocery store, to open in Ross|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/business/news/giant-eagle-opens-new-grocery-store-660280/|accessdate=4 January 2013|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nGood Cents and Valu King both were [[no frills]] stores designed to compete with similar stores such as [[Aldi]], [[Save-A-Lot]], and [[Bottom Dollar Food]].\n\nOn February 25, 2015, Giant Eagle announced it would close all the Good Cents stores by the end of March. It was looking for open spots at nearby Giant Eagle locations for displaced employees.<ref>[http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/local/pittsburgh-area-good-cents-grocery-store-closing/nkJhH/ Pittsburgh-area Good Cents grocery store closing] [[WPXI]] (02/25/2015)</ref>\n\nOn March 2, 2015, all Good Cents stores were sold and closed.\n\n==Employees==\n\nGiant Eagle has about 32,000 employees and many of them are unionized under [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] Local 1776ks of Pittsburgh, and UFCW Local 880 of Cleveland. The Maryland and Columbus stores are not unionized, much like some independently owned stores throughout Pennsylvania and the Youngstown, Ohio area. Some employees in the Eagle's Nest and Photo Lab departments are also non-union employees.\n\n==Advertising==\n\nGiant Eagle currently uses the slogan \"That's Another Giant Eagle Advantage\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gianteagle.com/save/thats-my-giant-eagle-advantage |title=Advantage Card - Save |publisher=Giant Eagle |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2013-03-03}}</ref> with its advertising, focusing on the eAdvantage offer of the week.

From 2009 until 2011, the slogan was \"Low prices. Uncompromising quality.\" In December 2009, a variation being used was \"Lower prices.

It was meant to showcase product quality as compared to the convenience focus used in the previous campaign.<ref name=\"Lindeman\"/>\n\nFrom 1993 until 2001, \"it takes a giant to make life simple\" was used as the slogan. This was focused on convenience, and spawned the \"Fee Fi Fo Fum\" commercials. The commercials featured everything from the general store, the produce and deli departments to a spot featuring [[Jay Bell]] and [[Jeff King (baseball)|Jeff King]] of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. This replaced the previous \"A lot you can feel good about{{nbsp}}... especially the price\" motto.\n\nThe chain, under pressure from [[Wal-Mart]], has implemented a lower-prices campaign throughout its stores, featured on products that customers buy most. Giant Eagle also sells [[Topco]]-produced Valu Time products, which are substantially cheaper than other private-label and name-brand merchandise. These co-exist with the Giant Eagle branded items, which are priced lower than national brands, yet higher than Valu Time. Before these brands existed, Giant Eagle generally used Topco's Food Club label as the generic product.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n==Criticism==\n[[File:Giant Eagle Vermilion.JPG|thumb|This former [[Kroger]] store is now occupied by Giant Eagle in [[Vermilion, Ohio]].]]\n\nGiant Eagle has the highest market share of any supermarket chain in the Pittsburgh area, giving it a [[de facto]] [[monopoly]] in some parts of western Pennsylvania; only stores supplied by [[Supervalu (United States)|Supervalu]] such as [[Shop 'n Save (Pittsburgh)|Shop 'n Save]], [[FoodLand]], [[Save-A-Lot]], and [[County Market]] have much of a presence in the area.  The construction of new supercenters, including [[Walmart]] and others, and [[no frills]] supermarkets such as [[Aldi]] attracting value-seeking customers have somewhat decreased Giant Eagle's regional market share in first decades of the twenty-first century.\n\nGiant Eagle's market dominance in Greater Pittsburgh has led to accusations of the company buying up either existing supermarket locations or prime real estate for the sole purpose of not allowing a competitor come in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtae.com/article/two-local-shop-n-save-stores-to-become-giant-eagles-by-august/7466578|title=Giant Eagle buying some Shop 'n Saves|first=Ashlie|last=Hardway|date=9 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> A notable example came in 2016, when the chain purchased property in [[McCandless, Pennsylvania]] that had been planned for a Walmart location near an existing Giant Eagle; Walmart later backed out and Giant Eagle made no immediate announcement of plans for the property.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2016/12/02/locally-owned-giant-eagle-steps-up-to-stop-mccandless-walmart/|title=Giant Eagle Purchases Land, Tries To Halt Plans For McCandless Walmart|first=John|last=Shumway|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> The deal came only weeks after Giant Eagle laid off 350 workers from its corporate office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2016/10/31/Giant-Eagle-to-cut-350-corporate-jobs/stories/201610310209|title=Giant Eagle cutting 350 corporate jobs with buyouts, layoffs|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> Similar accusations have been made about GetGo not allowing [[Sheetz]] or [[Speedway LLC|Speedway]] opening up locations within the Pittsburgh city limits while GetGo has, although both competitor chains have several locations within the immediate suburbs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wtae.com/news/getgo-hiring-300-new-positions-in-pittsburgh-region/32547922|title=GetGo hiring today for 200 new jobs in Pittsburgh area|access-date=2016-08-14}}</ref> Giant Eagle was also successful in blocking a Walmart location opening at the dilapidated [[Northern Lights Shopping Center]] in [[Economy, Pennsylvania]], though Walmart eventually opened a location on the hillside behind the property in 2014 after finding a [[loophole]] around Giant Eagle's lease at Northern Lights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-west/walmart-store-could-be-built-behind-northern-lights-in-economy-228593/|title=Walmart store could be built behind Northern Lights in Economy|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]}}</ref>\n\nBefore Walmart, Giant Eagle's last nationally-significant competitor in the Pittsburgh market was [[Kroger]], which had bought the original Eagle but exited Western Pennsylvania in 1984 due to labor issues with its union as well as the local economy at the time. Many Giant Eagle locations in Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio occupy former Kroger sites and used the distinctive Kroger prototypes from the 1980s with the sloped glass-roof entrance until most of the stores were remodeled or replaced with newer stores in the early 2000s with Giant Eagle's current prototype. Kroger and Giant Eagle still compete head-to-head in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Indianapolis]].\n\nDespite the perceived monopoly, Giant Eagle holds only a 32% market share in Pittsburgh as of August 2018, just barely edging out Walmart.<ref>https://www.wesa.fm/post/giant-eagle-doesnt-monopolize-pittsburghs-grocery-scene-so-why-does-it-feel-it#stream/0</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|1=https://www.gianteagle.com/}}\n*[http://www.marketdistrict.com/ Market District's official website]\n\n\n{{Pittsburgh Corporations}}\n{{Supermarkets of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Privately held companies based in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Economy of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Supermarkets of the United States]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1931]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:1931 establishments in Pennsylvania]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the supermarket chain|the bird|Haast's eagle}}\n{{Distinguish|Giant Food Stores (Carlisle)|Giants-Eagles rivalry}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = Giant Eagle, Inc.\n| logo = GiantEagle.svg\n| type = [[Private company|Private]]\n| area_served = [[Pennsylvania]], [[West Virginia]], [[Ohio]], [[Maryland]], [[Indiana]]\n| key_people = [[David Shapira]], Executive [[Chairman]]<ref name=PPGexecutives>{{cite news|last=Linderman|first=Teresa F.|title=Giant Eagle names new CEO, president|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/business/businessnews/2011/11/16/Giant-Eagle-names-new-CEO-president/stories/201111160225|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=November 16, 2011}}</ref> <br /> Laura Shapira Karet, [[CEO]] and President<ref>https://progressivegrocer.com/giant-eagle-presidentcoo-john-lucot-retire</ref> <br />\n| industry = [[Grocery|Retail (Grocery)]]\n| products = Bakery, dairy, deli, frozen foods, general grocery, meat, pharmacy, produce, seafood, snacks, liquor, lottery tickets, fuel, sushi, Western Union, money orders, dry ice, prepared foods,\n| services = Convenience/Forecourt Store, Other Specialty, Supermarket, Gas Stations\n| revenue = {{decrease}} [[US$]] 8.9 billion ([[Fiscal Year|FY]] 2017)\n| num_employees = 37,000\n| homepage = {{URL|https://www.gianteagle.com/|gianteagle.com}}\n| foundation = August 31, 1931<ref name=\"founding\">[https://www.corporations.pa.gov/search/corpsearch Pennsylvania Department of State search] entity 139000</ref>\n| location = [[O'Hara Township, Pennsylvania|O'Hara Township]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]\n| locations = 474 ( 216 supermarkets, 202 GetGo stores, 56 Ricker's stores )\n| subsid = [[GetGo]], RX-21 LLC, Ricker Oil Company, Inc., Rini-Rego Supermarkets, Inc., Seegrid Corporation.\n}}\n\n'''Giant Eagle''' ({{IPAc-en|US|\u02c8|d\u0292|a\u026a|n|.|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259l}} {{respell|JYNE|ihgl}}; [[Western Pennsylvania English|local pronunciation]]) is an American [[supermarket]] chain with stores in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]], [[West Virginia]], [[Indiana]], and [[Maryland]].

In 1928, Eagle, now 125 stores strong, merged with [[Kroger]]. The three families agreed to stay out of the grocery business for at least three years.\n\nMeanwhile, the Moravitz and Weizenbaum families built their own successful chain of grocery stores named OK Grocery. In 1931, OK Grocery merged with Eagle Grocery to form Giant Eagle, which was incorporated two years later. Giant Eagle quickly expanded across western Pennsylvania, weathering the Great Depression and World War II.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gianteagle.net/Article.aspx?cntid=178046 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528062541/http://www.gianteagle.net/Article.aspx?cntid=178046 |archivedate=2013-05-28 }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:GiantEagleStowOhio.jpg|thumb|right|234px|Giant Eagle in [[Stow, Ohio]]. This is the current Giant Eagle prototype, used since the late 1990s, but has the 1980s-era Giant Eagle logo font.]]\nThe chain remained based solely in western Pennsylvania until the 1980s, when it bought [[Youngstown, Ohio]]-based wholesaler Tamarkin Company, and its Valu-King stores that were converted to the Giant Eagle name. The [[Kent, Ohio|Kent]] and [[Ravenna, Ohio|Ravenna]] stores were the first to be converted at that time; the Youngstown stores then got converted years later. Around the mid- or late 1990s, Giant Eagle later reached [[Cleveland]] by acquiring the Stop-n-Shop stores in the area. Stop-n-Shop stores were family owned and operated in different areas of Cleveland. The family operators of Stop-n-Shop formed a holding company named International Seaway Foods as the main umbrella for Stop-n-Shop. In 1998, Giant Eagle acquired the International Seaway Foods and converted the Stop-n-Shop Stores into Giant Eagle Stores. Giant Eagle also purchased or opened other [[Northeast Ohio]] stores outside the Stop-n-Shop area, such as the former Apples supermarkets in the nearby [[Akron, Ohio]] area.\n\nThe company entered the [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] market, opening two stores in 2001 and 2004, both of which have now closed. Giant Eagle emerged as one of the dominant supermarket chains in Northeast Ohio, competing mainly against the New York-based [[Tops Markets, LLC|Tops]], from which it purchased 18 stores in October 2006. The purchases came as Tops exited the Northeast Ohio area.\n\nGiant Eagle purchased independently owned [[County Market]] stores, giving it a store in [[Somerset, Pennsylvania]], a new store in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], and its first Maryland stores: one in [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], one in [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]], and two in [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]]. The Cumberland store closed in December 2003, and the Hagerstown store closed in August 2005. \n\nGiant Eagle has aggressively expanded its footprint in the Greater [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] area, capitalizing on the demise of the former [[Big Bear (supermarket)|Big Bear]] supermarket chain, and taking Big Bear's traditional place as Columbus's upmarket grocer. Giant Eagle first entered what it calls its \"Columbus Region\" in late 2000, opening three large newly built stores at Sawmill and Bethel Rd., Lewis Center, and Dublin-Granville Rd., with two more following in 2002 and 2003 at Gahanna and Hilliard-Rome Rd. The Hilliard-Rome Rd. location closed in early 2017. In 2004, Giant Eagle purchased nine former Big Bear stores in Columbus, Newark, and Marietta from parent company [[Penn Traffic]]. Giant Eagle has since expanded to several additional locations, acquiring other abandoned Big Bear stores and in newly constructed buildings using the current Giant Eagle prototype. Giant Eagle opened its 20th Columbus-area at New Albany Road at the Ohio Rt. 161 freeway (New Albany) in August 2007, its 21st area store at Hayden Run and Cosgray Roads (Dublin) in November 2007, its 22nd area store at Stelzer and McCutcheon Roads (Columbus) in July 2008 and its 23rd area store at South Hamilton Road and Winchester Pike [[Groveport, Ohio|(Groveport)]] in August 2008. A new Giant Eagle opened in [[Lancaster, Ohio|Lancaster]], in November 2008, and the former Big Bear located at Blacklick Crossing is undergoing an expansion and remodeling.\n\nOn September 27, 2018, Giant Eagle announced it would purchase the [[Ricker's]] convenience store chain in Indiana, marking the largest acquisition for GetGo since the chain's launch. It is not known if the Ricker's chain will be integrated into the GetGo brand following the closure of the deal.<ref>https://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/indianapolis/giant-eagle-to-acquire-56-rickers-convenience-stores-across-indiana</ref> Much as it has done in Pennsylvania alongside [[Sheetz]], GetGo plans to join Ricker's in having Indiana change their laws regarding alcohol sales.<ref>http://www.heraldbulletin.com/business/ricker-s-stores-to-be-sold-to-giant-eagle-supermarket/article_45885136-c276-11e8-99e8-c70b929361ac.html</ref>\n\n==Loyalty program==\n\nIn 1991, Giant Eagle introduced the \"Advantage Card\", an electronic [[loyalty card]] discount system (already popular in many chains), as a sophisticated version of the obsolete stamp programs. The card was later modified to double as a video rental card for Iggle Video. More recently the company has started the Fuelperks! program to entice customers. This program allows customer the opportunity to earn 10 cents off each gallon of gas (20 cents in select markets) with fifty dollars' worth of authorized purchases. In early 2009, Giant Eagle launched the Foodperks! program, mainly geared towards GetGo. This program allows customers who use their fuelperks! at GetGo to also earn foodperks! to save on groceries purchased at Giant Eagle. Every 10 gallons of gas purchased earns a 1% discount. This can be used up to 20% maximum at a time on a purchase of up to $300. Foodperks! are valid for 90 days and fuelperks! are valid for 60 days. If the customer has more than the price of gasoline or more than the 20%, those discounts will stay on their card for the remainder of the 90/60 days, and if they are not used by then, they expire. In February 2013, Giant Eagle announced that they would be discontinuing the foodperks! program that month because it was \"a little too complex\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Schmitz|first=Jon|title=Giant Eagle will end foodperks! grocery rewards program|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/business/news/giant-eagle-will-end-foodperks-grocery-rewards-program-673291/|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=February 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Giant Eagle began implementing fuelperks+, an enhancement to the existing fuelperks program that reintroduces the benefits of the previous foodperks benefit which had been discontinued in 2013. Under the new fuelperks+ program, customers earn one perk per dollar spent at Giant Eagle, Market District or GetGo stores. Also, customers can earn five perks for every prescription filled at Giant Eagle or Market District. At GetGo, customers earn two perks per gallon of gas. Once 50 perks is reached, customers can choose between 2% off on groceries (maximum discount 20% off or $10,000) or 10 cents off each gallon of gas (up to 30 free gallons per one vehicle). As in the previous fuelperks! program, if customers have more than the price of gasoline or more than the 20%, those discounts will remain on their Advantage Card for the remainder of the 60 day time period.<ref>https://account.gianteagle.com/fuelperks-plus/perksvideo/?return=ge</ref>\n\n==Operations==\n[[File:Giant Eagle footprint.png|250px|thumb|right|Map of Giant Eagle stores]]\n\nThere are 221 store and GetGo locations in the United States: 99 in western [[Pennsylvania]], 122 in central, northeastern, and eastern [[Ohio]], two in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], [[West Virginia]], two in [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], [[Maryland]] and one in [[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]], [[Indiana]]. Each store carries between 22,000 and 60,000 items, approximately 5,000 of which are branded by Giant Eagle.\n\nGiant Eagle offers more than two dozen departments across its stores. The range of services includes [[Redbox]] video terminals, dry cleaning, in-store day care, and pharmacies. Giant Eagle also has [[bank]]ing partnerships with [[Citizens Financial Group|Citizens Bank]] in Pennsylvania and [[Huntington Bancshares|Huntington Bank]] in Ohio and West Virginia, both of which have their branches open inside Giant Eagle branches seven days a week except for federal holidays.\n\nThe chain has built large prototypes, and it has experimented with many departments unusual to supermarkets. Larger stores feature vast selections of ethnic and organic food, dry cleaning services, Iggle video, drive-thru pharmacies, in-store banking, Eagle's Nest (for daycare purposes while shopping), as well as in-store coffee shops and prepared foods. Prepared foods are also sold at larger GetGo locations that can accommodate a GetGo Kitchen.\n\nAlthough older Giant Eagle locations tend to be [[trade union|unionized]] and some are even [[franchising|franchised]] stores, in recent years the company has started leaning toward non-union company-owned and -operated stores. In areas where a franchised store exists, if a [[GetGo]] exists nearby, it's operated by Giant Eagle itself, separate from the franchised supermarket.\n\n===Current brands===\n\n====Market District====\n[[File:Giant Eagle Market District at the Kingsdale Shopping Center.jpg|thumb|right|Giant Eagle Market District in [[Upper Arlington, Ohio]]]]\n\nGiant Eagle rebranded some of its stores as '''Market District''' in an attempt to attract upscale shoppers.

The store is larger than a GetGo, but much smaller than a regular Giant Eagle supermarket store. However, the store offers many of the same services as a Giant Eagle, such as a deli and a drive-through pharmacy. Giant Eagle Express also offers a [[caf\u00e9]] with prepared sandwiches, Giant Eagle's own Market District coffee, salad bar, and a wireless internet connection. There is also a GetGo gas station.<ref>[http://www.gianteagleexpress.com/Article.aspx?cntid=39 The Express Experience] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816232025/http://www.gianteagleexpress.com/Article.aspx?cntid=39 |date=2007-08-16 }}, 30 May 2007.</ref>\n\n====Market District Express====\n\nOn June 4, 2013, Giant Eagle announced new Market District Express concept, which is designed to be a hybrid of the flagship Market District format launched in 2006 with the Giant Eagle Express format that was launched in 2007.

Giant Eagle Pharmacy also offers several immunizations throughout the year for [[pneumonia]], [[influenza]], and [[Shingrix]].

Monus|Mickey Monus]] with the financing necessary to start his chain. After Monus was convicted of [[embezzlement]], Phar-Mor filed for bankruptcy and eventually liquidated. Due to Giant Eagle's stake in Phar-Mor, it was able to acquire Phar-Mor's Youngstown-area assets in bankruptcy court after the chain liquidated.\n\n====Iggle Video====\n\nGiant Eagle once operated Iggle Video locations inside many of its locations to serve as its [[video rental shop]]. Like Giant Eagle Pharmacy, Iggle Video (which spelled \"eagle\" from its phonetic pronunciation in [[Pittsburgh English|Pittsburghese]], even outside of Pittsburgh) never operated in stand-alone locations. Like other video rental chains, Iggle Video offered movie and video game rentals. They also served as the local [[Ticketmaster]] outlet in the Pittsburgh region before the advent of the Internet made it possible to buy live event tickets from Ticketmaster online. In the mid- to late 2000s, Giant Eagle phased these stores out in favor of [[Redbox]] [[automated retail]] machines, with Ticketmaster sales moved to the customer service desk.\n\n====Giant Eagle Optical====\n\nIn October 2004, Giant Eagle began a [[long-term experiment]] with in-store optometry centers dubbed \"Giant Eagle Optical\". There were four locations in the Pittsburgh area: North Hills (McIntyre Square), South Hills (Donaldson's Crossroads), east (Monroeville), and west (Robinson). The stores accepted most major vision plans and offered a wide variety of designer frames, as well as exclusive Giant Eagle brands. They also participated in the Fuelperks! program and were staffed mostly by ABO-certified opticians. Noting that \"some programs don't prove viable across a broad number of stores\", Giant Eagle chose to close its Optical locations beginning in August 2009.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09226/990741-28.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Giant Eagle ends optical, shop-scan services | first=Teresa F. | last=Lindeman | date=2009-08-14}}</ref>\n\n====Valu King and Good Cents====\n[[Image:Valuking.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Valu King logo]]\n[[File:Valu King 1989 Logo.jpg|thumb|right|Valu King 1989]]\n\nIn December 2008, Giant Eagle opened the rebranded Valu King supermarket in Eastlake, Ohio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/business/2008/12/valu_king_food_market_opens_in.html|title=Valu King Food Market opens in Eastlake|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> The Valu King name dates back to the 1980s, when Giant Eagle bought Youngstown wholesaler Tamarkin Co. and its original Valu King stores were eventually converted to the Giant Eagle name.

The concept is similar to that of a Valu King, but carries a slightly larger product selection. Good Cents eventually replaced all rebranded Valu King as Giant Eagle's low-cost brand.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lindeman|first=Teresa|title=Good Cents, Giant Eagle's new low-price grocery store, to open in Ross|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/business/news/giant-eagle-opens-new-grocery-store-660280/|accessdate=4 January 2013|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nGood Cents and Valu King both were [[no frills]] stores designed to compete with similar stores such as [[Aldi]], [[Save-A-Lot]], and [[Bottom Dollar Food]].\n\nOn February 25, 2015, Giant Eagle announced it would close all the Good Cents stores by the end of March. It was looking for open spots at nearby Giant Eagle locations for displaced employees.<ref>[http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/local/pittsburgh-area-good-cents-grocery-store-closing/nkJhH/ Pittsburgh-area Good Cents grocery store closing] [[WPXI]] (02/25/2015)</ref>\n\nOn March 2, 2015, all Good Cents stores were sold and closed.\n\n==Employees==\n\nGiant Eagle has about 32,000 employees and many of them are unionized under [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] Local 1776ks of Pittsburgh, and UFCW Local 880 of Cleveland.

This was focused on convenience, and spawned the \"Fee Fi Fo Fum\" commercials. The commercials featured everything from the general store, the produce and deli departments to a spot featuring [[Jay Bell]] and [[Jeff King (baseball)|Jeff King]] of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. This replaced the previous \"A lot you can feel good about{{nbsp}}... especially the price\" motto.\n\nThe chain, under pressure from [[Wal-Mart]], has implemented a lower-prices campaign throughout its stores, featured on products that customers buy most. Giant Eagle also sells [[Topco]]-produced Valu Time products, which are substantially cheaper than other private-label and name-brand merchandise. These co-exist with the Giant Eagle branded items, which are priced lower than national brands, yet higher than Valu Time. Before these brands existed, Giant Eagle generally used Topco's Food Club label as the generic product.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n==Criticism==\n[[File:Giant Eagle Vermilion.JPG|thumb|This former [[Kroger]] store is now occupied by Giant Eagle in [[Vermilion, Ohio]].]]\n\nGiant Eagle has the highest market share of any supermarket chain in the Pittsburgh area, giving it a [[de facto]] [[monopoly]] in some parts of western Pennsylvania; only stores supplied by [[Supervalu (United States)|Supervalu]] such as [[Shop 'n Save (Pittsburgh)|Shop 'n Save]], [[FoodLand]], [[Save-A-Lot]], and [[County Market]] have much of a presence in the area.  The construction of new supercenters, including [[Walmart]] and others, and [[no frills]] supermarkets such as [[Aldi]] attracting value-seeking customers have somewhat decreased Giant Eagle's regional market share in first decades of the twentieth century.\n\nGiant Eagle's market dominance in Greater Pittsburgh has led to accusations of the company buying up either existing supermarket locations or prime real estate for the sole purpose of not allowing a competitor come in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtae.com/article/two-local-shop-n-save-stores-to-become-giant-eagles-by-august/7466578|title=Giant Eagle buying some Shop 'n Saves|first=Ashlie|last=Hardway|date=9 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> A notable example came in 2016, when the chain purchased property in [[McCandless, Pennsylvania]] that had been planned for a Walmart location near an existing Giant Eagle; Walmart later backed out and Giant Eagle made no immediate announcement of plans for the property.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2016/12/02/locally-owned-giant-eagle-steps-up-to-stop-mccandless-walmart/|title=Giant Eagle Purchases Land, Tries To Halt Plans For McCandless Walmart|first=John|last=Shumway|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> The deal came only weeks after Giant Eagle laid off 350 workers from its corporate office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2016/10/31/Giant-Eagle-to-cut-350-corporate-jobs/stories/201610310209|title=Giant Eagle cutting 350 corporate jobs with buyouts, layoffs|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> Similar accusations have been made about GetGo not allowing [[Sheetz]] or [[Speedway LLC|Speedway]] opening up locations within the Pittsburgh city limits while GetGo has, although both competitor chains have several locations within the immediate suburbs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wtae.com/news/getgo-hiring-300-new-positions-in-pittsburgh-region/32547922|title=GetGo hiring today for 200 new jobs in Pittsburgh area|access-date=2016-08-14}}</ref> Giant Eagle was also successful in blocking a Walmart location opening at the dilapidated [[Northern Lights Shopping Center]] in [[Economy, Pennsylvania]], though Walmart eventually opened a location on the hillside behind the property in 2014 after finding a [[loophole]] around Giant Eagle's lease at Northern Lights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-west/walmart-store-could-be-built-behind-northern-lights-in-economy-228593/|title=Walmart store could be built behind Northern Lights in Economy|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]}}</ref>\n\nBefore Walmart, Giant Eagle's last nationally-significant competitor in the Pittsburgh market was [[Kroger]], which had bought the original Eagle but exited Western Pennsylvania in 1984 due to labor issues with its union as well as the local economy at the time. Many Giant Eagle locations in Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio occupy former Kroger sites and used the distinctive Kroger prototypes from the 1980s with the sloped glass-roof entrance until most of the stores were remodeled or replaced with newer stores in the early 2000s with Giant Eagle's current prototype. Kroger and Giant Eagle still compete head-to-head in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Indianapolis]].\n\nDespite the perceived monopoly, Giant Eagle holds only a 32% market share in Pittsburgh as of August 2018, just barely edging out Walmart.<ref>https://www.wesa.fm/post/giant-eagle-doesnt-monopolize-pittsburghs-grocery-scene-so-why-does-it-feel-it#stream/0</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|1=https://www.gianteagle.com/}}\n*[http://www.marketdistrict.com/ Market District's official website]\n\n\n{{Pittsburgh Corporations}}\n{{Supermarkets of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Privately held companies based in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Economy of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Supermarkets of the United States]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1931]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:1931 establishments in Pennsylvania]]\n", "name_user": "Hmich176", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCriticism:corrected twentieth century to twenty-first century", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Eagle"}

It is the first prototype to bear the [[Aston Martin]] name since the [[Aston Martin AMR1|AMR1]] in 1989.  Aston Martin's internal name for the car, DBR1-2, refers to the specific [[Aston Martin DBR1|DBR1]] chassis which won six races in 1959 en route to clinching the [[1959 World Sportscar Championship season|World Sportscar Championship]] as well as that year's [[1959 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]].<ref name=\"SpeedTV\" />\n[[File:2009Lola-AstonMartinLMP1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|2009 Lola-Aston Martin B09/60 at the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]]]]\n\n==Development==\n\nThe B09/60 is an evolution of the [[Lola B08/60]] LMP1 design used by Aston Martin Racing in 2008.  As before it uses the same racing prepared {{convert|6.0|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[V12 engine]] from the [[Aston Martin DBR9]] GT1 car, but with larger [[air restrictor]]s allowing for an increase of {{convert|50|hp|abbr=on}} due to using a production-based engine. This V12 is a little heavier, taller and longer than custom-built prototype racing engines. The standard Lola gearbox was replaced by a more compact [[Xtrac Limited|Xtrac]] 6-speed which is operated with paddle-shifting. An unusual feature to the car is the rearward brake cooling, which feeds the air to the brakes through two fans, and eliminates brake ducts on the body.\n\n==Racing history==\n\nTwo B09/60s  competed in the full [[2009 Le Mans Series season|Le Mans Series season]], while a third car entered under the AMR Eastern Europe banner for [[Charouz Racing Systems]] also competed at the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]] and in the last three races of the LMS. The number 007 car won the Le Mans Series overall, and the number 009 finished fourth. \n\nAt Le Mans the B09/60 of Jan Charouz, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Enge and Stefan M\u00fccke finished fourth behind the factory entries of Peugeot and Audi, as well as being the highest finishing petrol-fuelled  car. The 008 car was running as high as 3rd overall in the morning until Anthony Davidson had a collision with a GT1 Aston. Subsequent repairs and a 5-minute stop and go penalty\u2014for causing the collision\u2014dropped the car out of contention.\n\nA Lola Aston Martin competed at the [[2010 12 Hours of Sebring]], which marked the first time the Lola - Aston Martin entered a race in the United States. The [[Lowe's]]-sponsored car finishing the race in 3rd position, three laps behind the two winning Peugeots. No factory cars were entered into the 2010 1000&nbsp;km of Spa. Three cars have also been entered in the [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans]], although only the 007 and 009 cars will be run by Aston Martin Racing; the 008 car was scheduled to be run by the French team [[Signature-Plus]]. Both the 008 and 009 cars suffered from problems and had to be retired, leaving only the 007 to finish 6th overall and completing 365 laps, less than it did in 2009. It was the third highest petrol finisher behind Oreca and the LMP2 winner Strakka HPD.\n\nAt the 1000&nbsp;km of Silverstone, the Lola-Aston Martin finished 4th and the highest petrol finisher.\n{{Listen|filename=Lola-Aston Martin LMP1 (2009).ogg|title=Lola-Aston Martin B09/60 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed|type=sound}}\n\nIn 2011, the car was raced by Team [[Cytosport]] in the [[American Le Mans Series]] with regular drivers [[Klaus Graf (racing driver)|Klaus Graf]] and [[Lucas Luhr]]. The team failed to finish the first round at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], but rebounded by overtaking the polesitting [[Dyson Racing]] car at Long Beach to take the win. The team went on to win again at Mosport, Mid-Ohio and Road America and finished the season in second place in the LMP1 category behind Dyson Racing.\n\nWith [[Aston Martin Racing]] switching to their new car, the [[Aston Martin AMR-One|AMR-One]] for the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans]], a B09/60 was entered by [[Kronos Racing]] in cooperation with fellow Belgian outfit [[Marc VDS Racing Team]]. The car was driven by [[Vanina Ickx]], [[Bas Leinders]] and [[Maxime Martin]] and finished the race seventh overall, twenty-seven laps behind the race winning [[Audi R18 TDI]].\n\nAfter suffering reliability problems and a lack of speed with its new [[Aston Martin AMR-One|AMR-One]] prototype, Aston Martin Racing reverted to using a B09/60 for the final three rounds of the [[2011 Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] as well as round eight of the [[2011 American Le Mans Series season]], the [[Monterey Sports Car Championships|American Le Mans Monterey]] at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. The lone factory Aston started third behind the two Dyson Lola machines, but the race would end with the Aston winning by three laps, notching up another victory for the car. The grandfathered car also got a surprise podium finish at [[Petit Le Mans]] after 3 of the 4 factory cars ([[Audi]] and [[Peugeot]]) crashed.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110615160716/http://www.astonmartinracing.com/home Aston Martin Racing]\n\n{{Aston Martin Racing}}\n{{Aston Martin Sportscar Racers}}\n{{Lola Sports Cars}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lola-Aston Martin B09 60}}\n[[Category:Aston Martin racing cars]]\n[[Category:Le Mans Prototypes]]\n[[Category:Lola racing cars|Aston Martin LMP1]]\n[[Category:Sports prototypes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2017}}\n{{Racing car\n| Car_name         = Lola-Aston Martin B09/60<br>(Aston Martin DBR1-2)\n| Image            = [[File:009 DBR1-2.jpg|200px]]\n| Category         = [[Le Mans Prototype]] LMP1\n| Constructor      = [[Lola Cars|Lola Cars International]]<br>[[Prodrive]]\n| Designer         = \n| Team             = {{flagicon|UK}} [[Aston Martin Racing]]<br>{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Charouz Racing Systems|AMR Eastern Europe]]<br>{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Signature-Plus]]<br>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Muscle Milk Motorsports|Muscle Milk]] [[Aston Martin Racing]]\n| Predecessor      = [[Lola B08/60]]\n| Drivers          = {{flagicon|CZE}} [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Enge]]<br>{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Jan Charouz]]<br>{{flagicon|DEU}} [[Stefan M\u00fccke]]<br>{{flagicon|UK}} [[Darren Turner]]<br>{{flagicon|SUI}} [[Harold Primat]]<br>{{flagicon|POR}} [[Miguel Ramos]]<br>{{flagicon|MEX}} [[Adri\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez]]<br>{{flagicon|DEU}} [[Klaus Graf (racing driver)|Klaus Graf]]\n| Technical ref    = <ref name=tech>{{cite web | url = http://www.astonmartinracing.com/eng/thecars/lolaastonmartinlmp1 | title = Lola-Aston Martin LMP1 | publisher = [[Aston Martin Racing]] | accessdate = 2009-04-07 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090604063611/http://www.astonmartinracing.com/eng/thecars/lolaastonmartinlmp1 | archive-date = 4 June 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n| Chassis          = [[Carbon fiber|Carbon fibre]] [[monocoque]]\n| Front suspension = [[Double wishbone suspension|Double wishbone]] with adjustable Koni [[Shock absorber|dampers]]\n| Rear suspension  = Double wishbone with adjustable Koni dampers\n| Length           = {{convert|4634|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| Width            = {{convert|1990|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| Wheelbase        = {{convert|2890|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| Track            = {{convert|1990|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| Engine name      = [[Aston Martin]]\n| Horse Power      = {{convert|650|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}\n| Capacity         = {{convert|6000|cc|cuin|abbr=on}}\n| Configuration    = 60\u00b0 [[V12 engine|V12]], DOHC, 94 x 71.96 mm ([[Bore (engine)|bore]] x [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]]),\n| Turbo/NA         = [[naturally aspirated]],\n| Engine position  = [[mid-engine design|mid-engined]], [[longitudinal engine|longitudinally mounted]]\n| Gearbox name     = \n| Gears            = 6-speed\n| Type             = [[sequential manual transmission|sequential manual]]\n| Differential     = \n| Weight           = appr. {{convert|900|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}\n| Fuel             = [[Gulf Oil|Gulf]]\n| Tyres            = 18\" [[Michelin]]\n| Debut            = [[2009 1000 km of Catalunya]]\n| Races            = 27<!-- Up to the 2011 Petit Le Mans -->\n| Wins             = 9\n| Cons_champ       = 1 <small>([[2009 Le Mans Series season|2009 LMS]])</small>\n| Drivers_champ    = 1 <small>([[2009 Le Mans Series season|2009 LMS]])</small>\n| Teams_champ      = 1 <small>([[2009 Le Mans Series season|2009 LMS]])</small>\n| Poles            = 4\n| Fastest_laps     = 5\n|}}\nThe '''Lola-Aston Martin B09/60''', also known as the '''Aston Martin DBR1-2''',<ref name=\"SpeedTV\">{{cite web | url = http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/lms-lola-aston-martin-b09-60/ | title = Lola-Aston Martin B09/60 | publisher = [[Speed Channel|SpeedTV.com]] | author = Woulter Melissen | date = 2009-04-14 | accessdate = 2009-04-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090417033823/http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/lms-lola-aston-martin-b09-60/ | archive-date = 17 April 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref> is a [[Le Mans Prototype]] [[sports prototype|sports car]] built by [[Lola Cars|Lola Cars International]] and co-developed with [[Prodrive]] for use by [[Aston Martin Racing]].

As before it uses the same racing prepared {{convert|6.0|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[V12 engine]] from the [[Aston Martin DBR9]] GT1 car, but with larger [[air restrictor]]s allowing for an increase of {{convert|50|hp|abbr=on}} due to using a production-based engine. This V12 is a little heavier, taller and longer than custom-built prototype racing engines. The standard Lola gearbox was replaced by a more compact [[Xtrac Limited|Xtrac]] 6-speed which is operated with paddle-shifting. An unusual feature to the car is the rearward brake cooling, which feeds the air to the brakes through two fans, and eliminates brake ducts on the body.\n\n==Racing history==\n\nTwo B09/60s  competed in the full [[2009 Le Mans Series season|Le Mans Series season]], while a third car entered under the AMR Eastern Europe banner for [[Charouz Racing Systems]] also competed at the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]] and in the last three races of the LMS. The number 007 car won the Le Mans Series overall, and the number 009 finished fourth. \n\nAt Le Mans the B09/60 of Jan Charouz, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Enge and Stefan M\u00fccke finished fourth behind the factory entries of Peugeot and Audi, as well as being the highest finishing petrol-fuelled  car. The 008 car was running as high as 3rd overall in the morning until Anthony Davidson had a collision with a GT1 Aston. Subsequent repairs and a 5-minute stop and go penalty\u2014for causing the collision\u2014dropped the car out of contention.\n\nA Lola Aston Martin competed at the [[2010 12 Hours of Sebring]], which marked the first time the Lola - Aston Martin entered a race in the United States. The [[Lowe's]]-sponsored car finishing the race in 3rd position, three laps behind the two winning Peugeots. No factory cars were entered into the 2010 1000&nbsp;km of Spa. Three cars have also been entered in the [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans]], although only the 007 and 009 cars will be run by Aston Martin Racing; the 008 car was scheduled to be run by the French team [[Signature-Plus]]. Both the 008 and 009 cars suffered from problems and had to be retired, leaving only the 007 to finish 6th overall and completing 365 laps, less than it did in 2009. It was the third highest petrol finisher behind Oreca and the LMP2 winner Strakka HPD.\n\nAt the 1000&nbsp;km of Silverstone, the Lola-Aston Martin finished 4th and the highest petrol finisher.\n{{Listen|filename=Lola-Aston Martin LMP1 (2009).ogg|title=Lola-Aston Martin B09/60 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed|type=sound}}\n\nIn 2011, the car was raced by Team [[Cytosport]] in the [[American Le Mans Series]] with regular drivers [[Klaus Graf (racing driver)|Klaus Graf]] and [[Lucas Luhr]]. The team failed to finish the first round at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], but rebounded by overtaking the polesitting [[Dyson Racing]] car at Long Beach to take the win. The team went on to win again at Mosport, Mid-Ohio and Road America and finished the season in second place in the LMP1 category behind Dyson Racing.\n\nWith [[Aston Martin Racing]] switching to their new car, the [[Aston Martin AMR-One|AMR-One]] for the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans]], a B09/60 was entered by [[Kronos Racing]] in cooperation with fellow Belgian outfit [[Marc VDS Racing Team]]. The car was driven by [[Vanina Ickx]], [[Bas Leinders]] and [[Maxime Martin]] and finished the race seventh overall, twenty-seven laps behind the race winning [[Audi R18 TDI]].\n\nAfter suffering reliability problems and a lack of speed with its new [[Aston Martin AMR-One|AMR-One]] prototype, Aston Martin Racing reverted to using a B09/60 for the final three rounds of the [[2011 Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] as well as round eight of the [[2011 American Le Mans Series season]], the [[Monterey Sports Car Championships|American Le Mans Monterey]] at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. The lone factory Aston started third behind the two Dyson Lola machines, but the race would end with the Aston winning by three laps, notching up another victory for the car. The grandfathered car also got a surprise podium finish at [[Petit Le Mans]] after 3 of the 4 factory cars ([[Audi]] and [[Peugeot]]) crashed.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110615160716/http://www.astonmartinracing.com/home Aston Martin Racing]\n\n{{Aston Martin Sportscar Racers}}\n{{Lola Sports Cars}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lola-Aston Martin B09 60}}\n[[Category:Aston Martin racing cars]]\n[[Category:Le Mans Prototypes]]\n[[Category:Lola racing cars|Aston Martin LMP1]]\n[[Category:Sports prototypes]]\n", "name_user": "Speedy Question Mark", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lola-Aston_Martin_B09/60"}
