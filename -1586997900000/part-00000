While the Alsatian versions have primarily been considered simpler wines, it was recently (2006) included among the varieties that can be used to produce [[Alsace Grand Cru AOC|Alsace Grand Cru]] wine together with the four 'noble grapes' of Alsace, although only in one vineyard, Zotzenberg.\n\nThis dichotomy is explained by the vigour of the Sylvaner vine and the grape's neutral flavour, which can lead to blandness unless yields are controlled. On the other hand, it gives a blank canvas for the expression of [[terroir]], and on good sites with skilled winemaking, Sylvaner can produce elegant wines. It has high acidity but naturally reaches high [[must weight]]s, so is often blended with other varieties such as [[Riesling]] or [[Elbling]], and is sometimes made into a [[dessert wine]].\n\n==History==\nSylvaner is an ancient variety that has long been grown in [[Central Europe]], in [[Transylvania]]. In Germany it is best known as a component of [[Liebfraumilch]] and production boomed in the 1970s to the detriment of quality, but it has long enjoyed a better reputation in [[Franconia (wine region)|Franconia]] than in other German wine regions. [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA fingerprinting]] has revealed it to be a cross between [[Traminer]] and the [[Frankish and Hunnic grape varieties|\"hunnic\"]] variety [[\u00d6sterreichisch-Wei\u00df]] (meaning \"Austrian White\").<ref>Sefc KM, Steinkellner H, Gl\u00f6ssl J, Kampfer S, Regner F [https://www.researchgate.net%2Fprofile%2FKristina_Sefc%2Fpublication%2F225172192_Reconstruction_of_a_grapevine_pedigree_by_microsatellite_analysis%2Flinks%2F09e414fbdf822c42b2000000%2FReconstruction-of-a-grapevine-pedigree-by-microsatellite-analysis.pdf%26hl%3Dde%26sa%3DX%26scisig%3DAAGBfm3tZbqy9A_wggmijNxWkAJ5SGmEvg%26nossl%3D1%26oi%3Dscholarr&usg=AOvVaw3EadwvnPcCC2jdiBMtSZKz Reconstruction of a grapevine pedigree by microsatellite analysis] Theoretical and Applied Genetics {{ISSN|0040-5752}}  1998, vol. 97, no1-2, pp. 227-231</ref> As a result, it is now thought to have originated in [[Austrian Empire]] ([[Transylvania]]).\n\nIt is thought that the grape came to Germany after the [[Thirty Years War]] as there is a record of Sylvaner from Austria being planted at [[County of Castell]] in [[Franconia]] on 5 April 1659.<ref>{{cite web | last = Diel | first = Armin | authorlink =  |author2=Payne, Joel  | title = WeinGuide - Franken | work =  | publisher = Gault Millau | year = 2006 | url = http://www.weinguide.de/dwe/rs/wissen_223.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2007-04-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070921044143/http://www.weinguide.de/dwe/rs/wissen_223.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-21}}</ref> So Germany celebrated the 350<small>th</small> anniversary of Silvaner in 2009.

It was Germany's most grown variety until it was overtaken by [[M\u00fcller-Thurgau]] around 1970.

However overproduction during the Liebfraumilch years ruined its reputation, and it has since retreated to its stronghold in [[Franconia (wine region)|Franconia]] (Frankenland) (1,425 ha), where on the best chalky [[Muschelkalk]] terroir it can produce wines that can compete with the best German white wines which usually are made out of the [[Riesling]] grape.

Otherwise, Sylvaner has more or less disappeared from California, where it was known as Sylvaner Riesling, Franken Riesling, Monterey Riesling, and Sonoma Riesling.

Dried rice, about a third of the amount, is filtered out with hot water for 20 to 30 minutes and then poured into the rice cooker three-quarters of the time. Stir with a spoon to let the rice out. Then cover and press the hold switch. If the cooking switch is pressed to make it boil, it will not be beneficial to eat, since the amylase enzyme in the oil of the stomach will lose its function of decomposition.\n\nAfter a few hours of keeping warm, the starch in the rice breaks down and leaves only a shell, so it's complete With the lid open, press the cook button and simmer for a few minutes, and the smell of the oil disappears. The finished Sikhye is not very sweet, so you have to adjust the sweetness by adding sugar. If you pour a low amount of sesame oil into the Godu rice and make it high in concentration, it will taste quite sweet, but the amount of Sikhye is very small.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=42701&docId=1820037&categoryId=42715|title=\uc2dd\ud61c|website=terms.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2019-04-27}}</ref>\n\nSikhye products sold on the market are flavored with sugar, and are only served with broken rice grass, which is far from the original Sikhye. Sikhye's unique taste stems from the oil of the stomach.\n\n==Contents==\nDrinking a bowl of sweet and cool Sikhye after a hearty meal during holidays and feasts is good for dessert and is helpful for digestion. Sikhye is simple in materials and easy to make, but it takes a lot of time.\n\nIf rice is made thick with rice or glutinous rice and is dissolved in pot oil and left warm overnight, the rice grains will cool and float upward. As rice is cooled by the action of the sugary enzyme contained in sesame oil, the unique sweetness and aroma of malt are created. When the rice cools down, add sugar or honey, boil it once, cool it down, and eat it cold. Add ginger minced or citron juice when it is boiling, which makes the flavor and taste even better. When serving Sikhye, it is better served with rice, which was served separately, and other grains such as pine nuts, jujubes, or red pomegranates can be served in a proper way.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=42701&docId=1820037&categoryId=42715|title=\uc2dd\ud61c|website=terms.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2019-04-27}}</ref>\n\nSikhye looks more delicious when served in a neat bowl. Also, the color of the soup and rice grains is important. If rice grains start to pop up when it is washed, you should remove them with a net or a dish, rinse them in cold water, keep them cold, and put a spoonful of Sikhye water in the top. The more rice grains, the more tender the sweet and white the color. Of course, the oil must be clean and the oil must be taken out and used according to the top. When the sediment is added, the rice ball becomes dark. \n\nA clear broth is not necessarily a good To make Sikhye delicious, the cooking oil must be better than anything else, and the temperature and time of cleansing are important. Drain the well-grown sesame oil and mix it with water and use the top water. It is used widely in Korea, and it is used in Sikhye, Gochujang, rice cake, and alcohol.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=46672&docId=559877&categoryId=46672|title=\uc2dd\ud61c|website=terms.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2019-04-27}}</ref>\n\nNow, if you put the rice balls in the thermos and let them sit for six to seven hours, they will get enough of it, so you can do it very easily. In the past, many things were needed, such as wrapping a blanket in a hot room. The rice ball must be maintained at 50 to 60\u00b0C to be allowed to cool. If left for longer periods at a lower temperature, it will rest before it is removed, and if it is too high, the enzyme will stop working and not at all.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Yeot-gireum.jpg|''Yeot-gireum'' (malted barley) used for making ''sikhye''\nFile:Korean beverage-Sikhye-01.jpg|A can of ''sikhye'', produced by [[Korea Yakult]]\nFile:Andong-Sikhye gotgam-mari strawberries.jpg|''Andong-sikhye'' with ''[[gotgam-mari]]'' and strawberries\nFile:Hobak-sikhye.jpg|''Hobak-sikhye'' (pumpkin rice punch)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food|Drink}}\n*[[Gamju]]\n*[[Korean cuisine]]\n*[[Korean tea]]\n*[[Plant milk]]\n*[[Rice milk]]\n*[[Sujeonggwa]]\n*[[Sungnyung]]\n*[[Vilac]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313053050/http://tradehelper.or.kr/catalog/ViewLargeImage.jsp?catalogId=C2004-0000012327&sel= Picture]\n*[http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=101247 Naver Encyclopedia article, in Korean]\n*[http://www.netcooks.com/recipes/Beverages/Shikhye.-.Sweet.Rice.Nectar.html Netcooks recipe]\n*[http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Food/recipes.cfm#Shikhye Lifeinkorea recipe]\n\n{{Milk substitutes}}\n{{Rice drinks}}\n\n[[Category:Fermented drinks]]\n[[Category:Korean drinks]]\n[[Category:Rice drinks]]\n[[Category:Andong]]\n[[Category:Korean cuisine]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=August 2011}}\n{{Infobox Korean name\n|img=File:Korean.food-Sikhye-01.jpg\n|imgwidth=200\n|caption=''Sikhye'' served in a bowl\n|hangul=\uc2dd\ud61c\n|hanja=[[wiktionary:\u98df|\u98df]][[wiktionary:\u91af|\u91af]]\n|rr=sikhye\n|mr=sikhye\n}}\n{{Korean cuisine}}\n'''''Sikhye''''' (\uc2dd\ud61c, also spelled '''''shikhye''''' or '''''shikeh'''''; also occasionally termed '''''dansul''''' or '''''gamju''''') is a traditional sweet Korean [[rice]] beverage, usually served as a [[dessert]].

Also, it is fermented for several days as opposed to being boiled.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hansik.org/zh/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?fboardId=1075 |title=All about Korean Food |publisher=Hansik.org |accessdate=2011-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402111719/http://www.hansik.org/zh/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?fboardId=1075 |archivedate=2012-04-02 }}</ref> The crunchy texture of the [[Korean radish|radish]] is kept despite the longer fermentation process; a soft texture would indicate an inferior product. Whereas the sweet canned or restaurant sikhye is enjoyed as a dessert beverage, Andong sikhye is appreciated as a digestive aid, containing [[lactobacillus]].\n\n==Names==\n''Sikhye'' is also referred to by the names ''dansul'' (\ub2e8\uc220) and ''[[gamju]]'' (\uac10\uc8fc; [[wiktionary:\u7518|\u7518]][[wiktionary:\u9152|\u9152]]). Both of these names mean \"sweet wine.\" However, they are also used to refer to a different, slightly alcoholic rice drink called ''gamju''.<ref name=KTO />\n\n===''Hobak-sikhye''===\n''Hobak-sikhye'' (pumpkin sikhye) is a water-boiled broth with pumpkin, steamed rice, and malt. It is fermented for several days at a proper temperature. Some sugar is added to taste sweet.\n\n===Andong ''sikhye''===\nIt is original sikhye in Andong, South Korea. It is a little bit different from other Sikhyes. This Sikhye's color is light red with red pepper added.\n\n=== ''Yeonyeop-sikhye'' ===\nYeonyeop-sikhye is made by wrapping the hot glutinous rice, sake, and honey in a lotus leaf. Before drinking, put up a few pieces of pine nuts.\n\n==Effects==\nSikhye is believed to aid digestion, it contains dietary fiber and anti-oxidants. It was regularly served to royalty after meals to help digestion.<ref name=seoul>{{cite web|title=Traditional Winter Beverage and thirst quencher, Sikhye|url=http://english.seoul.go.kr/cav/do/restaurant_view.php?idx=13950|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=2011-02-25}}</ref>\n\nSikhye is said to help people who have a \"cold\" constitution to be warm and also helps those who have too \"warm\" constitution to be less warm.<ref name=seoul /> It is also believed to be very helpful for relieving hangovers.<ref name=seoul />\n\n==Origin of a word==\nSikhye is a Chinese word that does not exist in China or Japan, but rather a Korean word similar to \"shikhye\" with similar pronunciation and meaning. Sik(or Sak) is related with mature and Hye is making alcohol or sweet juice. These two words were combined to form. However, there is not yet a solid literary basis for etymology<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.busan.com/view/busan/view.php?code=20150212000003|title=[\uc774\ud0dc\ud638\uc758 \uc74c\uc2dd \uc774\uc57c\uae30] \uc2dd\ud61c=\ub2e8\uc220?|website=\ubd80\uc0b0\uc77c\ubcf4|language=ko|access-date=2019-04-27}}</ref>.\n\n==How to cook==\nThe barley was soaked in water to wait for the buds to come out, then ground out the sun-dried sesame oil and filtered through the water with a fine sieve, then heated up the steamed rice from the Siru and fermented<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.joins.com/article/7768906|title=\uc2f9 \ud2d4\uc6cc \ube5a\uc740 \ub2e8\uc220\uc740 \uc655\uc138\uc790 \uc74c\ubcf5\uc8fc|last=\uc9c0\uba74\ubcf4\uae30|first=\uc785\ub825 2012 04 01 01:31 {{!}} 264\ud638 32\uba74|date=2012-04-01|website=\uc911\uc559\uc77c\ubcf4|language=ko|access-date=2019-04-27}}</ref>.\n\nSikhye can also be made from a pressure cooker in the home. Dried rice, about a third of the amount, is filtered out with hot water for 20 to 30 minutes and then poured into the rice cooker three-quarters of the time. Stir with a spoon to let the rice out. Then cover and press the hold switch. If the cooking switch is pressed to make it boil, it will not be beneficial to eat, since the amylase enzyme in the oil of the stomach will lose its function of decomposition.\n\nAfter a few hours of keeping warm, the starch in the rice breaks down and leaves only a shell, so it's complete With the lid open, press the cook button and simmer for a few minutes, and the smell of the oil disappears. The finished Sikhye is not very sweet, so you have to adjust the sweetness by adding sugar. If you pour a low amount of sesame oil into the Godu rice and make it high in concentration, it will taste quite sweet, but the amount of Sikhye is very small<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=42701&docId=1820037&categoryId=42715|title=\uc2dd\ud61c|website=terms.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2019-04-27}}</ref>.\n\nSikhye products sold on the market are flavored with sugar, and are only served with broken rice grass, which is far from the original Sikhye. Sikhye's unique taste stems from the oil of the stomach.\n\n==Contents==\nDrinking a bowl of sweet and cool Sikhye after a hearty meal during holidays and feasts is good for dessert and is helpful for digestion. Sikhye is simple in materials and easy to make, but it takes a lot of time.\n\nIf rice is made thick with rice or glutinous rice and is dissolved in pot oil and left warm overnight, the rice grains will cool and float upward. As rice is cooled by the action of the sugary enzyme contained in sesame oil, the unique sweetness and aroma of malt are created. When the rice cools down, add sugar or honey, boil it once, cool it down, and eat it cold. Add ginger minced or citron juice when it is boiling, which makes the flavor and taste even better. When serving Sikhye, it is better served with rice, which was served separately, and other grains such as pine nuts, jujubes, or red pomegranates can be served in a proper way<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=42701&docId=1820037&categoryId=42715|title=\uc2dd\ud61c|website=terms.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2019-04-27}}</ref>.\n\nSikhye looks more delicious when served in a neat bowl. Also, the color of the soup and rice grains is important. If rice grains start to pop up when it is washed, you should remove them with a net or a dish, rinse them in cold water, keep them cold, and put a spoonful of Sikhye water in the top. The more rice grains, the more tender the sweet and white the color. Of course, the oil must be clean and the oil must be taken out and used according to the top. When the sediment is added, the rice ball becomes dark. \n\nA clear broth is not necessarily a good To make Sikhye delicious, the cooking oil must be better than anything else, and the temperature and time of cleansing are important. Drain the well-grown sesame oil and mix it with water and use the top water. It is used widely in Korea, and it is used in Sikhye, Gochujang, rice cake, and alcohol<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=46672&docId=559877&categoryId=46672|title=\uc2dd\ud61c|website=terms.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2019-04-27}}</ref>.\n\nNow, if you put the rice balls in the thermos and let them sit for six to seven hours, they will get enough of it, so you can do it very easily. In the past, many things were needed, such as wrapping a blanket in a hot room. The rice ball must be maintained at 50 to 60\u00b0C to be allowed to cool. If left for longer periods at a lower temperature, it will rest before it is removed, and if it is too high, the enzyme will stop working and not at all.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Yeot-gireum.jpg|''Yeot-gireum'' (malted barley) used for making ''sikhye''\nFile:Korean beverage-Sikhye-01.jpg|A can of ''sikhye'', produced by [[Korea Yakult]]\nFile:Andong-Sikhye gotgam-mari strawberries.jpg|''Andong-sikhye'' with ''[[gotgam-mari]]'' and strawberries\nFile:Hobak-sikhye.jpg|''Hobak-sikhye'' (pumpkin rice punch)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food|Drink}}\n*[[Gamju]]\n*[[Korean cuisine]]\n*[[Korean tea]]\n*[[Plant milk]]\n*[[Rice milk]]\n*[[Sujeonggwa]]\n*[[Sungnyung]]\n*[[Vilac]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313053050/http://tradehelper.or.kr/catalog/ViewLargeImage.jsp?catalogId=C2004-0000012327&sel= Picture]\n*[http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=101247 Naver Encyclopedia article, in Korean]\n*[http://www.netcooks.com/recipes/Beverages/Shikhye.-.Sweet.Rice.Nectar.html Netcooks recipe]\n*[http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Food/recipes.cfm#Shikhye Lifeinkorea recipe]\n\n{{Milk substitutes}}\n{{Rice drinks}}\n\n[[Category:Fermented drinks]]\n[[Category:Korean drinks]]\n[[Category:Rice drinks]]\n[[Category:Andong]]\n[[Category:Korean cuisine]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhye"}

There is a domestic airport in a nearby city.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==History==\nThe town appears on older maps as Donets (Donetz, Donez) after the river of the [[Siverskyi Donets|same name]].\n\nThe foundation of modern Sievierodonetsk is closely connected with the beginning of construction of the Lysychansk Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant within the limits of the city of [[Lysychansk]] in 1934. Donets itself was already combined with Lysychansk. The first settlement of workers on the construction site was Liskhimstroi, near by Donets. In September 1935, the first school was opened in the settlement, a silicate brick plant started production, and the first three residential two-story houses were built. In 1940, there were 47 houses, a school, a club, a kindergarten, a nursery, and 10 buildings of a chemical combine in Liskhimstroi.\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], Liskhimstroi was occupied by [[Wehrmacht|German troops]] on July 11, 1942. It was liberated by the [[Red Army]] on February 1, 1943. Work to restore and expand the Lysychansk Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant began on December 10, 1943.

There is a domestic airport in a nearby city.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==History==\nThe town appears on older maps as Donets (Donetz, Donez) after the river of the [[Siverskyi Donets|same name]].\n\nThe foundation of modern Sievierodonetsk is closely connected with the beginning of construction of the Lysychansk Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant within the limits of the city of [[Lysychansk]] in 1934. Donets itself was already combined with Lysychansk. The first settlement of workers on the construction site was Liskhimstroi, near by Donets. In September 1935, the first school was opened in the settlement, a silicate brick plant started production, and the first three residential two-story houses were built. In 1940, there were 47 houses, a school, a club, a kindergarten, a nursery, and 10 buildings of a chemical combine in Liskhimstroi.\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], Liskhimstroi was occupied by [[Wehrmacht|German troops]] on July 11, 1942. It was liberated by the [[Red Army]] on February 1, 1943. Work to restore and expand the Lysychansk Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant began on December 10, 1943. By 1946, the pre-war housing stock was completely restored, which amounted to 17,000 square meters.\n\nIn 1950, four variants of a new name for Liskhimstroi were proposed: Svetlograd, Komsomolsk-on-Donets, Mendeleevsk, and Sievierodonetsk. In the same year, Liskhimstroi was renamed Sievierodonetsk, after the Siverskyi Donets River, and received the status of an urban settlement. January 1, 1951, the chemical plant produced its first output of ammonium nitrate.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://ukrainetrek.com/severodonetsk-city/  |title= Severodonetsk city, Ukraine trek |website= ukrainetrek.com }}</ref>\n\nA local newspaper is published in the city since April 1965<ref>\u2116 2910. \u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u044c // \u041b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 1986 - 1990. \u0427\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c 2. \u0413\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u044b. \u041c., \u00ab\u041a\u043d\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430\u00bb, 1994. \u0441\u0442\u0440.382</ref>.\n\n===Events in 2014===\nDuring the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]] the town was captured late May 2014<ref>http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/severodonetsk-residents-recall-occupiers-brutality-357837.html</ref> by [[War in Donbass|pro-Russian militants]].<ref>http://ua.comments.ua/politics/233744-na-luganshchini-diyut-ponad-4-tisyachi-chleniv.html</ref> No [[2014 Ukrainian presidential election|Ukrainian presidential election in 2014]] was held in the city as the militants did not allow the voting places to open and much of the [[Central Election Commission (Ukraine)|Election commission]] property was either stolen or destroyed.

The reason for this comparison was that photography, in theory, replicates some of the tasks currently done by memory.<ref name=\"Leslie2010\"/>\n\nThe differences in the functions of memory and the functions of photography, according to Kracauer, is that photography creates one fixed moment in time whereas memory itself is not beholden to a singular instance.  Photography is capable of capturing the physicality of a particular moment, but it removes any depth or emotion that might otherwise be associated with the memory.  In essence, photography cannot create a memory, but rather, it can create an artifact.  Memory, on the other hand, is not beholden to one particular moment of time, nor is it purposefully created.  Memories are impressions upon a person that they can recall due to the significance of the event or moment.<ref name=\"Leslie2010\"/>\n\nPhotography can also work to record time in a linear way, and Kracauer even hints that floods of photographs ward off death by creating a sort of permanence.  However, photography also excludes the essence of a person, and over time  photographs lose meaning and become a \"heap of details.\"<ref name=\"Leslie2010\"/>  This isn't to say that Kracauer felt that photography has no use for memory, it is simply that he felt that photography held more potential for historical memory than for personal memory.  Photography allows for a depth of detail that can be to the advantage of a collective memory, such as how a city or town once appeared because those aspects can be forgotten, or overridden throughout time as the physical landscape of the area changes.<ref name=\"Leslie2010\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nAlthough he wrote for both popular and scholarly publications throughout much of his career, in the United States (and in English) he mainly concentrated on philosophical and sociological writings. This attracted some criticism from American scholars who found his style difficult to penetrate.<ref>Pauline Kael, ''I Lost It at the Movies'', Boston: Little, Brown, 1965, p. 269.</ref> At the time of his death in 1966, Kracauer was somewhat marginal in both American and German intellectual contexts. He had long ago abandoned writing in German, yet his research remained difficult to place within American scientific and academic categories.\n\nIn the decades following Kracauer's death, translations of his earlier essays and works, such as \"The Mass Ornament,\" and the publication of his letters in German, revealed a fuller portrait of Kracauer's style and gradually brought greater recognition in the United States.

(Sicco) Mansholt], Parlement & Politiek. Retrieved on 10 February 2014.</ref>\n\nMansholt came from a [[socialist]] farmer's family in the Dutch province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. Both his father and grandfather were supporters of early socialist leaders such as [[Multatuli]], [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis|Domela Nieuwenhuis]], and [[Pieter Jelles Troelstra|Troelstra]]. His father, Lambertus H. Mansholt, was a delegate for the socialist [[Sociaal Democratische Arbeiders Partij|SDAP]] party in the Groningen provincial chamber. His mother, Wabien Andreae, daughter of a judge in [[Heerenveen]], was one of the first women to have studied Political Science. She organised political meetings for other women, usually in their own homes.\n\nTogether with two brothers and two sisters, Mansholt was raised at \"Huis ter Aa,\" a grand villa in [[Glimmen]].<ref>{{in lang|nl}} Albert F. Mellink, \"[http://bwsa.socialhistory.org/biografie/mansholt-l Mansholt, Lambertus Helprig]\", ''Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland'', 1986. Retrieved 7 August 2015.</ref> He attended the HBS-school in [[Groningen]] and after that went to Deventer, to the School of Tropical Agriculture,<ref name=\"parlement\"/> where he studied to become a tobacco farmer.\n\n== Agriculture ==\nHe moved to [[Java (island)|Java]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]], nowadays [[Indonesia]], and started work on a tea [[plantation]].\n\nHe returned to the Netherlands in 1936, unhappy with the colonial system. He wanted to become a farmer and moved to the [[Wieringermeer]], a [[polder]], reclaimed in 1937. There he started his own farm.\n\nHe married Henny J. Postel in 1938, and they had two sons and two daughters.<ref name=\"parlement\"/>\n\nIn the years of the Second World War he was an active member of the [[Dutch resistance|Resistance]]. He helped people who were in acute danger to hide in the Wieringermeerpolder; he organised clandestine food distributions for the western provinces.\n\n[[File:Aankomst Hoover, Bestanddeelnr 901-6394.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[List of ambassadors of the United States to the Netherlands|United States Ambassador to the Netherlands]] [[Stanley Hornbeck]], former [[President of the United States]] [[Herbert Hoover]] and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Supplies Sicco Mansholt at [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Airport Schiphol]] on 8 April 1946.]]\n\n== Politics ==\n=== Local politics ===\nMansholt became a member of the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (SDAP) in 1937,<ref name=\"parlement\"/> as a secretary of the local party. He had several public functions for the SDAP in Wieringermeer, including that of acting mayor of the Wieringermeer community.\n\n=== Minister of Agriculture ===\nImmediately after the war, in June 1945, socialist [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA) Prime Minister Schermerhorn asked him to take a seat in his cabinet as minister of Agriculture, Fishery and Food Distribution. He was the youngest member of a cabinet, aged only 36.\n\nHe was a member of 6 cabinets in total: Schermerhorn-Drees in 1945; Beel in 1946; Drees-Van Schaik in 1948, and another three Drees administrations: 1951, 1952 and 1956. As Minister of Agriculture during this time, he was one of the key architects of the EC's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]. In 1954 the parliamentary debate about the budget for the Department of Agriculture was postponed: the Minister was ice-skating the 200 kilometer long [[Elfstedentocht]] in the Dutch province of [[Friesland]], which he skated twice in his life.\n\n=== European Commission ===\nIn 1958, he became one of the [[European Commissioner|Commissioners]] of the new [[European Commission]]. He was [[European Commissioner for Agriculture|Commissioner for Agriculture]] and vice-president of the institution. He modernized European agriculture. E. F. Schumacher is his book, 'Small is Beautiful' argues against The Mansholt Plan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ditext.com/schumacher/small/2.html#2|title=(Type a title for your page here)|website=www.ditext.com|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nHe became [[President of the European Commission]] on 22 March 1972 ([[Mansholt Commission]]) and continued in that position until 5 January 1973. It was around that time he was heavily under the influence of [[Club of Rome]].\n\n== Life after politics ==\nMansholt published his [[autobiography]] ''De Crisis'' (The Crisis) in 1974.<ref name=\"parlement\"/>\n\nHe lived his last years in an old historic farm in the quiet village of [[Wapserveen]], where he died on 29 June 1995.<ref name=\"parlement\"/>\n\nHis daughter Lideke also died in 1995, aged 53.\n\n==Decorations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=5 |'''Military decorations'''\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Ribbon bar !!

(Sicco) Mansholt], Parlement & Politiek. Retrieved on 10 February 2014.</ref>\n\nMansholt came from a [[socialist]] farmer's family in the Dutch province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. Both his father and grandfather were supporters of early socialist leaders such as [[Multatuli]], [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis|Domela Nieuwenhuis]], and [[Pieter Jelles Troelstra|Troelstra]]. His father, Lambertus H. Mansholt, was a delegate for the socialist [[Sociaal Democratische Arbeiders Partij|SDAP]] party in the Groningen provincial chamber. His mother, Wabien Andreae, daughter of a judge in [[Heerenveen]], was one of the first women to have studied Political Science. She organised political meetings for other women, usually in their own homes.\n\nTogether with two brothers and two sisters, Mansholt was raised at \"Huis ter Aa,\" a grand villa in [[Glimmen]].<ref>{{in lang|nl}} Albert F. Mellink, \"[http://bwsa.socialhistory.org/biografie/mansholt-l Mansholt, Lambertus Helprig]\", ''Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland'', 1986. Retrieved 7 August 2015.</ref> He attended the HBS-school in [[Groningen]] and after that went to Deventer, to the School of Tropical Agriculture,<ref name=\"parlement\"/> where he studied to become a tobacco farmer.\n\n== Agriculture ==\nHe moved to [[Java (island)|Java]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]], nowadays [[Indonesia]], and started work on a tea [[plantation]].\n\nHe returned to the Netherlands in 1936, unhappy with the colonial system. He wanted to become a farmer and moved to the [[Wieringermeer]], a [[polder]], reclaimed in 1937. There he started his own farm.\n\nHe married Henny J. Postel in 1938, and they had two sons and two daughters.<ref name=\"parlement\"/>\n\nIn the years of the Second World War he was an active member of the [[Dutch resistance|Resistance]]. He helped people who were in acute danger to hide in the Wieringermeerpolder; he organised clandestine food distributions for the western provinces.\n\n[[File:Aankomst Hoover, Bestanddeelnr 901-6394.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[List of ambassadors of the United States to the Netherlands|United States Ambassador to the Netherlands]] [[Stanley Hornbeck]], former [[President of the United States]] [[Herbert Hoover]] and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Supplies Sicco Mansholt at [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Airport Schiphol]] on 8 April 1946.]]\n\n== Politics ==\n=== Local politics ===\nMansholt became a member of the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (SDAP) in 1937,<ref name=\"parlement\"/> as a secretary of the local party. He had several public functions for the SDAP in Wieringermeer, including that of acting mayor of the Wieringermeer community.\n\n=== Minister of Agriculture ===\nImmediately after the war, in June 1945, socialist [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA) Prime Minister Schermerhorn asked him to take a seat in his cabinet as minister of Agriculture, Fishery and Food Distribution. He was the youngest member of a cabinet, aged only 36.\n\nHe was a member of 6 cabinets in total: Schermerhorn-Drees in 1945; Beel in 1946; Drees-Van Schaik in 1948, and another three Drees administrations: 1951, 1952 and 1956. As Minister of Agriculture during this time, he was one of the key architects of the EC's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]. In 1954 the parliamentary debate about the budget for the Department of Agriculture was postponed: the Minister was ice-skating the 200 kilometer long [[Elfstedentocht]] in the Dutch province of [[Friesland]], which he skated twice in his life.\n\n=== European Commission ===\nIn 1958, he became one of the [[European Commissioner|Commissioners]] of the new [[European Commission]]. He was [[European Commissioner for Agriculture|Commissioner for Agriculture]] and vice-president of the institution. He modernized European agriculture. E. F. Schumacher is his book, 'Small is Beautiful' argues against The Mansholt Plan<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ditext.com/schumacher/small/2.html#2|title=(Type a title for your page here)|website=www.ditext.com|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>.\n\nHe became [[President of the European Commission]] on 22 March 1972 ([[Mansholt Commission]]) and continued in that position until 5 January 1973. It was around that time he was heavily under the influence of [[Club of Rome]].\n\n== Life after politics ==\nMansholt published his [[autobiography]] ''De Crisis'' (The Crisis) in 1974.<ref name=\"parlement\"/>\n\nHe lived his last years in an old historic farm in the quiet village of [[Wapserveen]], where he died on 29 June 1995.<ref name=\"parlement\"/>\n\nHis daughter Lideke also died in 1995, aged 53.\n\n==Decorations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=5 |'''Military decorations'''\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Ribbon bar !!

These three exceptions are: The continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the life or health of the mother; The existence of life-threatening fetal malformations; The pregnancy is the result of rape, non-consensual artificial insemination or incest.\n\n<br />\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1837 and 1936 penal legislation authorized [[therapeutic abortion]] while banning all other forms of abortion, regardless of whether the abortion consented or not. The 1890 Penal Code, in article 640, allowed for abortion when it was absolutely necessary to save the mother's life, but stated that the law did not recommend such means, which were \"generally condemned\" by the [[Catholic Church]], the official religion at the time.<ref name=c355-06 /> In all other cases, a third party who attempted to abort a fetus without the woman's consent faced three to six years' imprisonment (five to ten years if the abortion was successful) or one to three years imprisonment if the woman consented (four to eight years if the abortion was successful).<ref name=abortocolombiabook>{{cite book|last1=Molina Betancur|first1=Carlos Mario|title=El derecho al aborto en Colombia.

The law also provided for reduced sentences, of 3\u20136 months (5\u201310 months if the abortion was successful), in the case of \"honest women of good reputation\" who received an abortion to \"conceal their frailty\" (''aborto honoris causa'').<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nA very conservative 1922 law to reform the penal code would have eliminated therapeutic abortion and punished women who sought an abortion but maintained the ''aborto honoris causa'', but the law never entered into force. The ''aborto honoris causa'', a legal concept inherited from Spain and Italy, was based on the opinion that a single mother had lost her honour.<ref name=abortocolombiabook /> The 1936 Penal Code differentiated between consented abortion (one to four years imprisonment for the woman and practitioner) and abortion not consented to (one to six years for the practitioner), maintaining provisions for a reduced sentence (reduced by a half to two thirds) or full pardon for an abortion to save one's honour or that of the mother, sister, woman, her descendants, or adopted girl.<ref name=c355-06 /><ref name=abortocolombiabook />\n\nThe 1980 Penal Code, in articles 343 to 345, removed the ''aborto honoris causa'' and adopted penalties and attenuating circumstances which would be largely retained by the current penal code, adopted in 2000.\n\n\n\n'''<big>Decree 100 of 1980.

The majority opinion of the court contended the [[Constitution of Colombia|1991 Constitution]], which recognizes life as a fundamental right (in article 11) and cites it as one of the founding principles in the constitutional preamble and article 2, recognized the \"primacy and inviolability of life\", excluding any possibility for abortion and allowing the legislator to penalize such acts. Furthermore, it opined that \"the life of the unborn embodies a fundamental value, for the hope of its existence as a person, and its apparent helplessness requires special attention from the State.\"<ref name=c133-94>{{cite court|vol=Sentencia C-133/94|court=Constitutional Court|date=17 March 1994|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/RELATORIA/1994/C-133-94.htm}}</ref> Thus, Colombia's abortion legislation was constitutional under the State's obligation to protect the life of \"all persons\", which, at the time, the Court claimed \"obviously\" protected life during its formation and development given that these stages were condition for the viability of birth, the origin of the [[Legal personality|legal existence of a person]].<ref name=c133-94 /> In addition, the Court said, if the Constitution gives couples the right to decide their number of children, this right could only be exercised prior to conception since conception creates a being which is existentially distinct from the mother.<ref name=c133-94 />\n\n===Legal situation prior to 2006===\n\nAbortion was legally regulated by articles 122 through 124 of the Colombian Penal Code (law 599 of 2000). Article 122 of the Penal Code punished women who self-induced or consented to someone else inducing her abortion to imprisonment for a period of one to three years, increased to a term of 16 to 54 months by law 890 of 2004.<ref name=\"penalcode\" /> Article 123 punished those who practised an abortion without the woman's consent ''or'' on a girl under fourteen years of age to a period of imprisonment of 4 to 10 years, increased to 64 to 180 months by the 2004 law. Article 124, finally, allowed for attenuating circumstances: the prescribed penalty for abortion would be reduced by three quarters when the pregnancy was the result of rape or non-consensual artificial insemination.<ref name=penalcode>{{cite act|title=Ley por la cual se expide el C\u00f3digo Penal|type=Law|number=599|language=Spanish|date=2000|article=122-124|url=http://www.secretariasenado.gov.co/senado/basedoc/ley_0599_2000_pr004.html#122}}</ref>\n\n==Martha Sulay Gonz\u00e1lez's case==\n\nIn 2006, the case of [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]] woman [[Martha Gonzalez|Martha Sulay Gonz\u00e1lez]] brought national attention to the issue of abortion in the country.

Beginning in April 2005, several lawyers, led by M\u00f3nica Roa of the [[Women's Link Worldwide]] NGO, challenged the constitutionality of the abortion-related articles of the Penal Code to the Constitutional Court. The court consolidated three separate challenges into a single case.<ref name=elpais /> M\u00f3nica Roa's brief claimed that the ban on abortion violated a woman's constitutional right to the free development of her personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'') and autonomy, because the State was preventing her from deciding freely on issues which pertained solely to her. She further suggested that the legislation was [[Proportionality (law)|disproportional]], violated a woman's right to equality (by criminalizing a medical practice only needed by women, while the denial of an abortion was a clear example of discrimination against women violating their constitutional rights to health and life).<ref name=c355-06 /> Besides article 122 of the Penal Code, Roa also challenged the phrase in article 123 which subjected those who practised abortions on minors under fourteen to a higher prison sentence, as she said it violated a young girl's constitutionally-recognized autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 /> Finally, Roa challenged the entirety of article 124, because merely initiating criminal proceedings for an abortion in the face of sexual violence was violation of a woman's dignity, freedom and autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nSupporting her arguments, Roa also argued that clandestine abortions threatened a woman's life and cited several opinions from international organizations and international human rights instruments (which are of constitutional value and legally binding in Colombian constitutional law).<ref name=c355-06 /> Other constitutional arguments presented in favour of decriminalization included the secularism of the State, gender equality, human dignity, the right to intimacy and the freedom of conscience.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nReligious opposition to abortion was particularly intense during the court challenge, particularly from the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Opus Dei]], as well their allies in [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]].<ref name=elpais /> During the [[Colombian presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential campaign]], incumbent President [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe]] said that he opposed abortion, but most of his rivals, including eventual second-place finisher [[Carlos Gaviria D\u00edaz|Carlos Gaviria]], a former Constitutional Court magistrate, supported abortion rights and the legal challenge to the Penal Code.<ref name=elpais />\n\nThe Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) opposed abortion as a family planning measure, but gave a favourable opinion to the decriminalization of abortion in certain cases.<ref name=c355-06 /> In its intervention before the Court, the [[Ombudsman's Office of Colombia|Ombudsman]] (''Defensor del Pueblo''), an autonomous constitutional control organization, supported the legal challenge against the ban on abortion. Like other contributors, the Ombudsman claimed that the law was based on a retrograde view of women as \"merely biological\", ignoring modern constitutional provisions for gender equality.<ref name=c355-06 /> The [[Ministry of Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Social Protection]] primarily mentioned the public health risks associated with clandestine abortions to support its opinion that restrictive laws like those in Colombia were not efficient in any way in reducing unwanted pregnancies.\n\nThe [[Episcopal Conference of Colombia]] opposed the decriminalization of abortion, arguing that the impugned articles of the Penal Code protected the life, health and integrity of the unborn but also of the mother. The [[Magisterium]] assailed modern notions of liberty where people take as their sole and indisputable reference for their own choices, \"not the truth about good and evil, but only their subjective and changeable opinion or even their selfish and whimsical interest\", leading to the loss of any reference to common values and to a state where everything is negotiable, \"even the first of the fundamental rights, the right to life.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> The Episcopal Conference argued that the \"original and inalienable right to life\" could not be subject to political debate, and stated that to \"claim the right to abortion, to infanticide [...], means attributing to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: absolute power over and against others.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Notably, opponents of the challenge to the law brought attention to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which states in article 4.1 that \"Every person has the right to have his life respected. This right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the moment of conception.\" In addition to this formal intervention, the Constitutional Court received a written contribution signed by all the Archbishops in Colombia, including [[Pedro Rubiano Sa\u00e9nz]], [[Archbishop of Bogot\u00e1]], urging the Court to rule the articles constitutional.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe [[Inspector General of Colombia]], [[Edgardo Jos\u00e9 Maya Villaz\u00f3n|Edgardo Maya Villaz\u00f3n]], asked the Court to decriminalize abortion in the cases of maternal health, life-threatening foetal defects and conception without the woman's consent (in legal terms, ruling article 122 conditionally constitutional). Constitutionally, the Inspector General held that the right to life must be balanced with and interpreted alongside the principle of human dignity.<ref name=c355-06 /> The Inspector General concluded that criminalizing abortion in the aforementioned cases constituted an unreasonable and disproportionate sanction, interfering with a woman's fundamental rights.\n\n==Sentence C-355 of 2006==\n\nOn May 10, 2006, the Constitutional Court reached a 5-3 decision which partially decriminalized abortion in Colombia under certain circumstances.\n\nThe majority opinion examined several constitutional and legal issues pertaining to life and fundamental rights, including:<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n*'''Life and the right to live:''' The Court held that the Colombian Constitution not only protected the right to life but also recognized life as a value, which implied a duty for the State to protect life. However, if the legislators are allowed to adopt appropriate measures to comply with this duty, this does not mean that all measures adopted in this sense are necessarily justified, because life does not have the character of an absolute value or right and must be weighted with other constitutional values, principles and rights. The right to life (article 11 of the Constitution) is limited to human beings, while the protection of life as a value extends to the unborn.<ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n*'''Life in [[International human rights law]]:''' The Court considered the protection of the right to life in several international human rights treaties which hold constitutional status in Colombia as part of the 'constitutional bloc'. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] explicitly state that the right to life is held by the human person. The aforementioned American Convention on Human Rights states that the right to life must be protected by life, \"in general\" from the moment of conception; but the Court held that this was not of an absolute nature, notably because the terms \"in general\" contemplates possibilities in which the law does not protect life from the moment of conception. \n*'''Women's rights in the Colombian Constitution and international law:''' Gender equality and women's rights were constitutionally recognized in 1991, while international human rights conventions and legal instruments have protected women's reproductive rights and recognized violence against women as one of the most serious crimes.\n*'''Limits to the legislator's powers in criminal matters:''' While the Colombian legislator enjoys a wide margin of freedom in determining criminal law, this power is not unlimited. Criminal legislation must respect fundamental rights, constitutional principles and the legal principles of proportionality and reasonableness. Some of the constitutional limits to the legislator's power to legislate include human dignity (which, for women, includes the right to freely determine her life), the free development of personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'', individual autonomy) the right to health (which, for women, includes reproductive health) and international law.\n\nConcretely, the Court ruled that the total ban on abortion in Article 122 of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. While the life of the unborn is protected by the constitutional order, the Court considered that the legislator is not obligated to adopt criminal laws to protect the life of the unborn, although it also stated that such measures were not disproportionate. However, a complete ban on abortion meant the complete dominance of one legal interest (the life of the unborn) over all others, specifically the fundamental rights of the mother.<ref name=\"c355-06\" /> The Colombian Constitution, in the Court's opinion, is characterized by the coexistence of several values, principles and rights - none of which have an absolute value against the others. Therefore, the ban on abortion was therefore unconstitutional, as it completely ignored the dignity of the mother and reduced her to \"a mere receptacle of unborn life, lacking rights or constitutionally relevant interests meriting protection.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Article 124, which imposed a reduced sentence on the mother in cases of rape, was also ruled to be unconstitutional because it was disproportionate. As a result, the Court ruled that abortion should be permitted in cases where the pregnancy is the result of rape, artificial insemination without consent, incest, if the pregnancy threatens the life and health (physical and mental) of the woman and in cases of foetal malformations rendering the fetus inviable.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court also struck down the phrase \"or in women younger than fourteen\" in Article 123, which subjected those who practised an abortion on a woman younger than fourteen to a longer jail sentence. Prior constitutional jurisprudence had recognized that minors had the right, depending on their maturity, to consent to medical interventions or treatments.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court concluded by stating that it had limited itself to noting the three 'extreme scenarios' which violated the Constitution, and that nothing prevents the legislator from decriminalizing abortion in other circumstances.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n==Current legal situation==\n\nTo date, the Congress has not amended the Penal Code to take into account the Constitutional Court's C-355/06 ruling. Therefore, abortion in Colombia is currently permitted in the three instances which were decriminalized by sentence C-355/06. <ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n\n===Rape, incest and artificial insemination without consent===\n\nAbortion is permitted when the pregnancy is the result of rape, abusive sexual intercourse without consent, incest and artificial insemination or transfer of a fertilized ovum without consent. It is necessary that, in such circumstances, the offence has been duly reported to the appropriate authorities. Sentence C-355/06 explicitly barred legislators from adopting regulatory measures which would establish disproportionate burdens on women's rights, such as demanding forensic evidence of sexual penetration.\n\n===Maternal life or health===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where the continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the mother's physical or mental health or life, subject to medical certification. The Court did not establish specific cases which would constitute threats to a mother's health or life, instead leaving such tasks to medical professionals.\n\n===Fetal malformations===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where medically certified serious fetal malformations mean that the newborn would probably not survive. The Court did not establish specific malformations, leaving such tasks to medical professionals.\n\n===Conscientious objection===\n\nIn sentence C-355/06, the Constitutional Court reiterated that [[juridical persons]] do not have the right to conscientious objection, a right only recognized to [[natural persons]]. Therefore, no clinic, hospital or other health centre may refuse to practise abortions based on conscientious objections in the aforementioned cases. A doctor who refuses to practise an abortion must nevertheless refer the woman to another doctor who may perform the abortion. In another court ruling, T-209 of 2008, the Constitutional Court emphasized that a conscientious objection can only be based on religious convictions and not personal opinions.\n\n==='''Other circumstances'''===\n\nIn the absence of any change to the law, an abortion in any other circumstance remains illegal and punishable by 16 to 54 months imprisonment for both the woman and the person who performed the abortion.\n\n==Barriers and obstacles to abortion==\n\nDespite the decriminalization of abortion in several women's groups and the Constitutional Court have identified a number of barriers imposed on women seeking a legal abortion. These include requests for additional requirements to those set forth by sentence C-355/06, unfounded conscientious objections and medical boards unjustifiably delaying the procedure by more than 5 days (the limit estimated by the Court to respond to a woman's request).<ref>{{cite book|title=Determinantes del aborto inseguro y barreras de acceso para la atenci\u00f3n de la interrupci\u00f3n voluntaria del embarazo en mujeres colombianas|date=2014|publisher=Ministerio de Salud y Protecci\u00f3n Social and Fondo de Poblaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas (UNFPA)|location=Bogot\u00e1|isbn=978-958-873-575-7|url=http://profamilia.org.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Determinantes%20del%20aborto%20inseguro%20y%20barreras%20de%20acceso%20para%20la%20atencio%CC%81n%20de%20la%20IVE%20en%20mujeres%20colombianas.pdf|ref=profamilia publication}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, the Constitutional Court heard the case of a woman who was diagnosed with a severe fetal malformation that was incompatible with life, but her healthcare provider would only authorize an abortion if a judge granted a judicial order to do so (a condition not required under the law), which the judge did not grant because of conscientious objections. The court's ruling reiterated that neither institutions nor judicial authorities can refuse a woman an abortion based on conscience claims, and stated that, under the circumstances where an abortion is legal, women \"enjoy a right to decide, free from any pressure, coercion, urging, manipulation and, in general, any sort of inadmissible intervention, to terminate a pregnancy \u2026 it is forbidden to raise any obstacles, requirements or additional barriers.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Center Praises Momentous Decision in Abortion Case in Colombia|url=http://www.reproductiverights.org/press-room/center-praises-momentous-decision-in-abortion-case-in-colombia|website=Center for Reproductive Rights|accessdate=14 January 2016|date=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n\nIn October 2013, the [[Guttmacher Institute]] reported an estimated 400,400 induced abortions were performed in Colombia in 2008, of which only 322 were reported as legal procedures.<ref name=abortionstats>{{cite web|title=Unintended Pregnancy and Induced Abortion in Colombia|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-pregnancy-abortion-Colombia.html|website=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref> These numbers are much higher than the official statistics reported by the [[Colombian Ministry of Health|Ministry of Health]], which indicated that 15,000 abortions were performed in Colombia between 2009 and 2012.

TO BE RESOLVED in the judgment C-591 of 1995 by means of which it was decided \"Articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code be declared EXEQUIBLE\", regarding the charges for ignorance of articles 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 94 of the Constitution. Second. Declare INHIBITED to issue a substantive pronouncement, due to the substantive ineptitude of the lawsuit, regarding the charges made against articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code (for violation of articles 4, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50 and 95 of the Political Charter, as well as of the provisions of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of the United Nations Convention against Torture). Summary of the ruling Citizen Natalia Bernal Cano demanded the constitutionality of articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code. In his opinion, limiting the rights of those who are about to be born, does not know that they are \"innocent living beings capable of feeling pain and that they are attacked with abortive methods when they are in the womb because their human person status is not recognized, holder of rights and obligations \u201d3. Consequently, he maintained that the defendant provisions violate the provisions of the Constitution in its articles 1, 2, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50, 94 and 95; the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the United Nations Convention against Torture. The Court concluded that regarding the charges for ignorance of articles 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 94 of the Constitution, the phenomenon of constitutional res judicata operated for what was resolved in judgment C-591 of 1995, reiterated in judgment C-327 of 2016. In effect, it found that on that occasion the Court ruled regarding the constitutionality of the same legal provisions, for the same reasons stated in this application. Additionally, it clarified that the reasons stated by the plaintiff are not sufficient to weaken the existence of res judicata. Therefore, it was resolved in that judgment. On the other hand, the Court determined that the charges for ignorance of the Constitution in its articles 4, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50 and 95, of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of the Convention of the United Nations against Torture did not comply with the minimum requirements demanded by constitutional jurisprudence. '''Specifically, it maintained that they do not meet the requirements of certainty, clarity, specificity and sufficiency, which is why it declared itself inhibited from issuing a substantive pronouncement.'''\n\n\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n1.\t^ Jump up to Decree 100 of 1980 (Penal Code)\n2.\t^ Jump up to:a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u Sentencia C-355/06 (Constitutional Court 10 May 2006).\n3.\t^ Jump up to:a b c Molina Betancur, Carlos Mario (2006).

These three exceptions are: The continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the life or health of the mother; The existence of life-threatening fetal malformations; The pregnancy is the result of rape, non-consensual artificial insemination or incest.\n\n<br />\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1837 and 1936 penal legislation authorized [[therapeutic abortion]] while banning all other forms of abortion, regardless of whether the abortion consented or not. The 1890 Penal Code, in article 640, allowed for abortion when it was absolutely necessary to save the mother's life, but stated that the law did not recommend such means, which were \"generally condemned\" by the [[Catholic Church]], the official religion at the time.<ref name=c355-06 /> In all other cases, a third party who attempted to abort a fetus without the woman's consent faced three to six years' imprisonment (five to ten years if the abortion was successful) or one to three years imprisonment if the woman consented (four to eight years if the abortion was successful).<ref name=abortocolombiabook>{{cite book|last1=Molina Betancur|first1=Carlos Mario|title=El derecho al aborto en Colombia.

The law also provided for reduced sentences, of 3\u20136 months (5\u201310 months if the abortion was successful), in the case of \"honest women of good reputation\" who received an abortion to \"conceal their frailty\" (''aborto honoris causa'').<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nA very conservative 1922 law to reform the penal code would have eliminated therapeutic abortion and punished women who sought an abortion but maintained the ''aborto honoris causa'', but the law never entered into force. The ''aborto honoris causa'', a legal concept inherited from Spain and Italy, was based on the opinion that a single mother had lost her honour.<ref name=abortocolombiabook /> The 1936 Penal Code differentiated between consented abortion (one to four years imprisonment for the woman and practitioner) and abortion not consented to (one to six years for the practitioner), maintaining provisions for a reduced sentence (reduced by a half to two thirds) or full pardon for an abortion to save one's honour or that of the mother, sister, woman, her descendants, or adopted girl.<ref name=c355-06 /><ref name=abortocolombiabook />\n\nThe 1980 Penal Code, in articles 343 to 345, removed the ''aborto honoris causa'' and adopted penalties and attenuating circumstances which would be largely retained by the current penal code, adopted in 2000.\n\n\n'''<big>Decree 100 of 1980.

The majority opinion of the court contended the [[Constitution of Colombia|1991 Constitution]], which recognizes life as a fundamental right (in article 11) and cites it as one of the founding principles in the constitutional preamble and article 2, recognized the \"primacy and inviolability of life\", excluding any possibility for abortion and allowing the legislator to penalize such acts. Furthermore, it opined that \"the life of the unborn embodies a fundamental value, for the hope of its existence as a person, and its apparent helplessness requires special attention from the State.\"<ref name=c133-94>{{cite court|vol=Sentencia C-133/94|court=Constitutional Court|date=17 March 1994|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/RELATORIA/1994/C-133-94.htm}}</ref> Thus, Colombia's abortion legislation was constitutional under the State's obligation to protect the life of \"all persons\", which, at the time, the Court claimed \"obviously\" protected life during its formation and development given that these stages were condition for the viability of birth, the origin of the [[Legal personality|legal existence of a person]].<ref name=c133-94 /> In addition, the Court said, if the Constitution gives couples the right to decide their number of children, this right could only be exercised prior to conception since conception creates a being which is existentially distinct from the mother.<ref name=c133-94 />\n\n===Legal situation prior to 2006===\n\nAbortion was legally regulated by articles 122 through 124 of the Colombian Penal Code (law 599 of 2000). Article 122 of the Penal Code punished women who self-induced or consented to someone else inducing her abortion to imprisonment for a period of one to three years, increased to a term of 16 to 54 months by law 890 of 2004. Article 123 punished those who practised an abortion without the woman's consent ''or'' on a girl under fourteen years of age to a period of imprisonment of 4 to 10 years, increased to 64 to 180 months by the 2004 law. Article 124, finally, allowed for attenuating circumstances: the prescribed penalty for abortion would be reduced by three quarters when the pregnancy was the result of rape or non-consensual artificial insemination.<ref name=penalcode>{{cite act|title=Ley por la cual se expide el C\u00f3digo Penal|type=Law|number=599|language=Spanish|date=2000|article=122-124|url=http://www.secretariasenado.gov.co/senado/basedoc/ley_0599_2000_pr004.html#122}}</ref>\n\n==Martha Sulay Gonz\u00e1lez's case==\n\nIn 2006, the case of [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]] woman [[Martha Gonzalez|Martha Sulay Gonz\u00e1lez]] brought national attention to the issue of abortion in the country. Martha Sulay, already a mother of three, was diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]] while pregnant with her fourth child in 2004 (despite prior [[tubal ligation]]). Her requests for [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]] were denied, as they would entail the termination of her pregnancy, which was illegal. Her doctors said that they decided to continue her pregnancy because, although medical literature indicated that in such cases the pregnancy should be ignored and radiotherapy started, [[therapeutic abortion]] is illegal in Colombia and they would be committing a crime. Her cancer metastasized in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|last1=\u00c1rias|first1=Luis Francisco|title=No pudo abortar aunque ten\u00eda c\u00e1ncer y ahora ya no tiene cura|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1967332|accessdate=6 January 2016|work=El Tiempo|date=26 March 2006}}</ref><ref name=elpais>{{cite news|last1=Guerrero|first1=Yolanda|title=Colombia, historia de una lucha por la despenalizaci\u00f3n del aborto|url=http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2006/06/01/actualidad/1149112801_850215.html|accessdate=6 January 2016|work=El Pa\u00eds|date=1 June 2006}}</ref> However, experts in medical law argued that an abortion in her case would not have been penalized, as one would not be seeking the death of the fetus but rather to save the mother's life.<ref>{{cite news|title=Martha Sulay abre debate sobre aborto|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1969294|accessdate=6 January 2016|work=El Tiempo|date=28 March 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Court challenges==\n\nMartha Sulay Gonz\u00e1lez, supported by local and national groups, continued to demand the decriminalization of abortion in Colombia. Beginning in April 2005, several lawyers, led by M\u00f3nica Roa of the [[Women's Link Worldwide]] NGO, challenged the constitutionality of the abortion-related articles of the Penal Code to the Constitutional Court. The court consolidated three separate challenges into a single case.<ref name=elpais /> M\u00f3nica Roa's brief claimed that the ban on abortion violated a woman's constitutional right to the free development of her personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'') and autonomy, because the State was preventing her from deciding freely on issues which pertained solely to her. She further suggested that the legislation was [[Proportionality (law)|disproportional]], violated a woman's right to equality (by criminalizing a medical practice only needed by women, while the denial of an abortion was a clear example of discrimination against women violating their constitutional rights to health and life).<ref name=c355-06 /> Besides article 122 of the Penal Code, Roa also challenged the phrase in article 123 which subjected those who practised abortions on minors under fourteen to a higher prison sentence, as she said it violated a young girl's constitutionally-recognized autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 /> Finally, Roa challenged the entirety of article 124, because merely initiating criminal proceedings for an abortion in the face of sexual violence was violation of a woman's dignity, freedom and autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nSupporting her arguments, Roa also argued that clandestine abortions threatened a woman's life and cited several opinions from international organizations and international human rights instruments (which are of constitutional value and legally binding in Colombian constitutional law).<ref name=c355-06 /> Other constitutional arguments presented in favour of decriminalization included the secularism of the State, gender equality, human dignity, the right to intimacy and the freedom of conscience.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nReligious opposition to abortion was particularly intense during the court challenge, particularly from the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Opus Dei]], as well their allies in [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]].<ref name=elpais /> During the [[Colombian presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential campaign]], incumbent President [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe]] said that he opposed abortion, but most of his rivals, including eventual second-place finisher [[Carlos Gaviria D\u00edaz|Carlos Gaviria]], a former Constitutional Court magistrate, supported abortion rights and the legal challenge to the Penal Code.<ref name=elpais />\n\nThe Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) opposed abortion as a family planning measure, but gave a favourable opinion to the decriminalization of abortion in certain cases.<ref name=c355-06 /> In its intervention before the Court, the [[Ombudsman's Office of Colombia|Ombudsman]] (''Defensor del Pueblo''), an autonomous constitutional control organization, supported the legal challenge against the ban on abortion. Like other contributors, the Ombudsman claimed that the law was based on a retrograde view of women as \"merely biological\", ignoring modern constitutional provisions for gender equality.<ref name=c355-06 /> The [[Ministry of Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Social Protection]] primarily mentioned the public health risks associated with clandestine abortions to support its opinion that restrictive laws like those in Colombia were not efficient in any way in reducing unwanted pregnancies.\n\nThe [[Episcopal Conference of Colombia]] opposed the decriminalization of abortion, arguing that the impugned articles of the Penal Code protected the life, health and integrity of the unborn but also of the mother. The [[Magisterium]] assailed modern notions of liberty where people take as their sole and indisputable reference for their own choices, \"not the truth about good and evil, but only their subjective and changeable opinion or even their selfish and whimsical interest\", leading to the loss of any reference to common values and to a state where everything is negotiable, \"even the first of the fundamental rights, the right to life.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> The Episcopal Conference argued that the \"original and inalienable right to life\" could not be subject to political debate, and stated that to \"claim the right to abortion, to infanticide [...], means attributing to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: absolute power over and against others.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Notably, opponents of the challenge to the law brought attention to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which states in article 4.1 that \"Every person has the right to have his life respected. This right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the moment of conception.\" In addition to this formal intervention, the Constitutional Court received a written contribution signed by all the Archbishops in Colombia, including [[Pedro Rubiano Sa\u00e9nz]], [[Archbishop of Bogot\u00e1]], urging the Court to rule the articles constitutional.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe [[Inspector General of Colombia]], [[Edgardo Jos\u00e9 Maya Villaz\u00f3n|Edgardo Maya Villaz\u00f3n]], asked the Court to decriminalize abortion in the cases of maternal health, life-threatening foetal defects and conception without the woman's consent (in legal terms, ruling article 122 conditionally constitutional). Constitutionally, the Inspector General held that the right to life must be balanced with and interpreted alongside the principle of human dignity.<ref name=c355-06 /> The Inspector General concluded that criminalizing abortion in the aforementioned cases constituted an unreasonable and disproportionate sanction, interfering with a woman's fundamental rights.\n\n==Sentence C-355 of 2006==\n\nOn May 10, 2006, the Constitutional Court reached a 5-3 decision which partially decriminalized abortion in Colombia under certain circumstances.\n\nThe majority opinion examined several constitutional and legal issues pertaining to life and fundamental rights, including:<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n*'''Life and the right to live:''' The Court held that the Colombian Constitution not only protected the right to life but also recognized life as a value, which implied a duty for the State to protect life. However, if the legislators are allowed to adopt appropriate measures to comply with this duty, this does not mean that all measures adopted in this sense are necessarily justified, because life does not have the character of an absolute value or right and must be weighted with other constitutional values, principles and rights. The right to life (article 11 of the Constitution) is limited to human beings, while the protection of life as a value extends to the unborn.\n*'''Life in [[International human rights law]]:''' The Court considered the protection of the right to life in several international human rights treaties which hold constitutional status in Colombia as part of the 'constitutional bloc'. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] explicitly state that the right to life is held by the human person. The aforementioned American Convention on Human Rights states that the right to life must be protected by life, \"in general\" from the moment of conception; but the Court held that this was not of an absolute nature, notably because the terms \"in general\" contemplates possibilities in which the law does not protect life from the moment of conception. \n*'''Women's rights in the Colombian Constitution and international law:''' Gender equality and women's rights were constitutionally recognized in 1991, while international human rights conventions and legal instruments have protected women's reproductive rights and recognized violence against women as one of the most serious crimes.\n*'''Limits to the legislator's powers in criminal matters:''' While the Colombian legislator enjoys a wide margin of freedom in determining criminal law, this power is not unlimited. Criminal legislation must respect fundamental rights, constitutional principles and the legal principles of proportionality and reasonableness. Some of the constitutional limits to the legislator's power to legislate include human dignity (which, for women, includes the right to freely determine her life), the free development of personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'', individual autonomy) the right to health (which, for women, includes reproductive health) and international law.\n\nConcretely, the Court ruled that the total ban on abortion in Article 122 of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. While the life of the unborn is protected by the constitutional order, the Court considered that the legislator is not obligated to adopt criminal laws to protect the life of the unborn, although it also stated that such measures were not disproportionate. However, a complete ban on abortion meant the complete dominance of one legal interest (the life of the unborn) over all others, specifically the fundamental rights of the mother. The Colombian Constitution, in the Court's opinion, is characterized by the coexistence of several values, principles and rights - none of which have an absolute value against the others. Therefore, the ban on abortion was therefore unconstitutional, as it completely ignored the dignity of the mother and reduced her to \"a mere receptacle of unborn life, lacking rights or constitutionally relevant interests meriting protection.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Article 124, which imposed a reduced sentence on the mother in cases of rape, was also ruled to be unconstitutional because it was disproportionate. As a result, the Court ruled that abortion should be permitted in cases where the pregnancy is the result of rape, artificial insemination without consent, incest, if the pregnancy threatens the life and health (physical and mental) of the woman and in cases of foetal malformations rendering the fetus inviable.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court also struck down the phrase \"or in women younger than fourteen\" in Article 123, which subjected those who practised an abortion on a woman younger than fourteen to a longer jail sentence. Prior constitutional jurisprudence had recognized that minors had the right, depending on their maturity, to consent to medical interventions or treatments.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court concluded by stating that it had limited itself to noting the three 'extreme scenarios' which violated the Constitution, and that nothing prevents the legislator from decriminalizing abortion in other circumstances.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n==Current legal situation==\n\nTo date, the Congress has not amended the Penal Code to take into account the Constitutional Court's C-355/06 ruling. Therefore, abortion in Colombia is currently permitted in the three instances which were decriminalized by sentence C-355/06. <ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n\n===Rape, incest and artificial insemination without consent===\n\nAbortion is permitted when the pregnancy is the result of rape, abusive sexual intercourse without consent, incest and artificial insemination or transfer of a fertilized ovum without consent. It is necessary that, in such circumstances, the offence has been duly reported to the appropriate authorities. Sentence C-355/06 explicitly barred legislators from adopting regulatory measures which would establish disproportionate burdens on women's rights, such as demanding forensic evidence of sexual penetration.\n\n===Maternal life or health===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where the continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the mother's physical or mental health or life, subject to medical certification. The Court did not establish specific cases which would constitute threats to a mother's health or life, instead leaving such tasks to medical professionals.\n\n===Fetal malformations===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where medically certified serious fetal malformations mean that the newborn would probably not survive. The Court did not establish specific malformations, leaving such tasks to medical professionals.\n\n===Conscientious objection===\n\nIn sentence C-355/06, the Constitutional Court reiterated that [[juridical persons]] do not have the right to conscientious objection, a right only recognized to [[natural persons]]. Therefore, no clinic, hospital or other health centre may refuse to practise abortions based on conscientious objections in the aforementioned cases. A doctor who refuses to practise an abortion must nevertheless refer the woman to another doctor who may perform the abortion. In another court ruling, T-209 of 2008, the Constitutional Court emphasized that a conscientious objection can only be based on religious convictions and not personal opinions.\n\n==='''Other circumstances'''===\n\nIn the absence of any change to the law, an abortion in any other circumstance remains illegal and punishable by 16 to 54 months imprisonment for both the woman and the person who performed the abortion.\n\n==Barriers and obstacles to abortion==\n\nDespite the decriminalization of abortion in several women's groups and the Constitutional Court have identified a number of barriers imposed on women seeking a legal abortion. These include requests for additional requirements to those set forth by sentence C-355/06, unfounded conscientious objections and medical boards unjustifiably delaying the procedure by more than 5 days (the limit estimated by the Court to respond to a woman's request).<ref>{{cite book|title=Determinantes del aborto inseguro y barreras de acceso para la atenci\u00f3n de la interrupci\u00f3n voluntaria del embarazo en mujeres colombianas|date=2014|publisher=Ministerio de Salud y Protecci\u00f3n Social and Fondo de Poblaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas (UNFPA)|location=Bogot\u00e1|isbn=978-958-873-575-7|url=http://profamilia.org.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Determinantes%20del%20aborto%20inseguro%20y%20barreras%20de%20acceso%20para%20la%20atencio%CC%81n%20de%20la%20IVE%20en%20mujeres%20colombianas.pdf|ref=profamilia publication}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, the Constitutional Court heard the case of a woman who was diagnosed with a severe fetal malformation that was incompatible with life, but her healthcare provider would only authorize an abortion if a judge granted a judicial order to do so (a condition not required under the law), which the judge did not grant because of conscientious objections. The court's ruling reiterated that neither institutions nor judicial authorities can refuse a woman an abortion based on conscience claims, and stated that, under the circumstances where an abortion is legal, women \"enjoy a right to decide, free from any pressure, coercion, urging, manipulation and, in general, any sort of inadmissible intervention, to terminate a pregnancy \u2026 it is forbidden to raise any obstacles, requirements or additional barriers.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Center Praises Momentous Decision in Abortion Case in Colombia|url=http://www.reproductiverights.org/press-room/center-praises-momentous-decision-in-abortion-case-in-colombia|website=Center for Reproductive Rights|accessdate=14 January 2016|date=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n\nIn October 2013, the [[Guttmacher Institute]] reported an estimated 400,400 induced abortions were performed in Colombia in 2008, of which only 322 were reported as legal procedures.<ref name=abortionstats>{{cite web|title=Unintended Pregnancy and Induced Abortion in Colombia|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-pregnancy-abortion-Colombia.html|website=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref> These numbers are much higher than the official statistics reported by the [[Colombian Ministry of Health|Ministry of Health]], which indicated that 15,000 abortions were performed in Colombia between 2009 and 2012.

TO BE RESOLVED in the judgment C-591 of 1995 by means of which it was decided \"Articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code be declared EXEQUIBLE\", regarding the charges for ignorance of articles 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 94 of the Constitution. Second. Declare INHIBITED to issue a substantive pronouncement, due to the substantive ineptitude of the lawsuit, regarding the charges made against articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code (for violation of articles 4, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50 and 95 of the Political Charter, as well as of the provisions of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of the United Nations Convention against Torture). Summary of the ruling Citizen Natalia Bernal Cano demanded the constitutionality of articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code. In his opinion, limiting the rights of those who are about to be born, does not know that they are \"innocent living beings capable of feeling pain and that they are attacked with abortive methods when they are in the womb because their human person status is not recognized, holder of rights and obligations \u201d3. Consequently, he maintained that the defendant provisions violate the provisions of the Constitution in its articles 1, 2, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50, 94 and 95; the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the United Nations Convention against Torture. The Court concluded that regarding the charges for ignorance of articles 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 94 of the Constitution, the phenomenon of constitutional res judicata operated for what was resolved in judgment C-591 of 1995, reiterated in judgment C-327 of 2016. In effect, it found that on that occasion the Court ruled regarding the constitutionality of the same legal provisions, for the same reasons stated in this application. Additionally, it clarified that the reasons stated by the plaintiff are not sufficient to weaken the existence of res judicata. Therefore, it was resolved in that judgment.
