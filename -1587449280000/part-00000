'I' and 'you' are clearly established and 'you' are clearly wrong. The repetitive text and accompaniment's droning single harmony work in tandem to drive home relentlessly the singer's perspective.\" Harvey notes that Dylan transforms \"Nottamun Town\", which has absurdly nonsensical words (a naked drummer accompanies a royal procession \"with his heels in his bosom\") into a confrontational political song; Dylan's writing entered a new phase\u2014harsh, and fitting with the times.<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=71}}</ref>\n\nOn January 17, 1961, President [[Dwight D.

The song is a sort of striking out... a feeling of what can you do?\"<ref name=Hentoff>{{harvnb|Hentoff|1963}}</ref>\n\nCritic Andy Gill described the song as \"the bluntest condemnation in Dylan's songbook, a torrent of plain speaking pitched at a level that even the objects of its bile might understand it.\" Gill points out that when the song was published in ''Broadside'' magazine in February 1963, it was accompanied by drawings by [[Suze Rotolo]], Dylan's girlfriend at the time, which depicted a man carving up the world with a knife and fork, while a hungry family forlornly looks on.<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1999|p=26}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Todd Harvey, in this song Dylan \"allows the listener no opportunity to see the issue from the masters' eyes. 'I' and 'you' are clearly established and 'you' are clearly wrong. The repetitive text and accompaniment's droning single harmony work in tandem to drive home relentlessly the singer's perspective.\" Harvey notes that Dylan transforms \"Nottamun Town\", which has absurdly nonsensical words (a naked drummer accompanies a royal procession \"with his heels in his bosom\") into a confrontational political song; Dylan's writing entered a new phase\u2014harsh, and fitting with the times.<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=71}}</ref>\n\nOn January 17, 1961, President [[Dwight D.

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

In addition to spitting, the cheetah hits the ground with its front paws.<ref name=Eklund_al2012/>\n* Bleating: Similar to the meow of the domestic cat, the cheetah can bleat, and sometimes moan, when a larger predator deprives it of its prey.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Chirping or stutter-barking: A cheetah chirps when excited (for instance, when gathered around a kill). This vocalisation can also be used at social meetings, during courtship, or in attempting to find another; the chirp of a mother searching for her cubs, which sounds more like the yelp of a dog than the chirp of a bird, can be heard up to {{convert|2|km|mi}} away. A study estimated the chirp's total duration as 0.09 to 0.5 seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Churring: The purpose of this sound is similar to that of the chirp. It may resemble a growl. The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr is [[staccato]] and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3\u201315 separate pulses and last 0.1\u20131.3 seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Mother-cub vocalizations: Apart from chirping, mothers use some other sounds to interact with their cubs. A repeated ''ihn ihn'' is used to gather the cubs, while a ''prr prr'' is used to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still in the presence of danger.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Whirring: This sound is produced by cubs bickering over a kill; the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Other methods====\n[[File:Two cheetahs together.jpg|thumbnail|left|Cheetahs grooming each other]]\nScent plays a significant role in [[olfactory communication]]. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and sniff at its own scent before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and her excrement can attract males from far off.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/>\n\nSocial meetings are marked by mutual sniffing in oral and genital areas, grooming one another, rubbing the cheeks, and face-licking. Further physical contact has not been observed.<ref name=Estes/>\n\nTear streaks are a means of visual communication. The tear streaks combined with the black lips and the contrasting white fur give the face a striking appearance and form clear expressions when viewed from a close range. The ears and the face are obscured from a distance, and so are the expressions. On the other hand, the tail is quite conspicuous and is probably used by mothers to direct juveniles to follow them.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Display behavior====\nCheetahs engage in several [[Display (zoology)|displays]] during fights, hunting, or self-defense. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah will hold its head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=\"soc\">{{cite journal |last1=Wielebnowski |first1=N.

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

In addition to spitting, the cheetah hits the ground with its front paws.<ref name=Eklund_al2012/>\n* Bleating: Similar to the meow of the domestic cat, the cheetah can bleat, and sometimes moan, when a larger predator deprives it of its prey.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Chirping or stutter-barking: A cheetah chirps when excited (for instance, when gathered around a kill). This vocalisation can also be used at social meetings, during courtship, or in attempting to find another; the chirp of a mother searching for her cubs, which sounds more like the yelp of a dog than the chirp of a bird, can be heard up to {{convert|2|km|mi}} away. A study estimated the chirp's total duration as 0.09 to 0.5 seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Churring: The purpose of this sound is similar to that of the chirp. It may resemble a growl. The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr is [[staccato]] and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3\u201315 separate pulses and last 0.1\u20131.3 seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Mother-cub vocalizations: Apart from chirping, mothers use some other sounds to interact with their cubs. A repeated ''ihn ihn'' is used to gather the cubs, while a ''prr prr'' is used to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still in the presence of danger.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Whirring: This sound is produced by cubs bickering over a kill; the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Other methods====\n[[File:Two cheetahs together.jpg|thumbnail|left|Cheetahs grooming each other]]\nScent plays a significant role in [[olfactory communication]]. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and sniff at its own scent before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and her excrement can attract males from far off.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/>\n\nSocial meetings are marked by mutual sniffing in oral and genital areas, grooming one another, rubbing the cheeks, and face-licking. Further physical contact has not been observed.<ref name=Estes/>\n\nTear streaks are a means of visual communication. The tear streaks combined with the black lips and the contrasting white fur give the face a striking appearance and form clear expressions when viewed from a close range. The ears and the face are obscured from a distance, and so are the expressions. On the other hand, the tail is quite conspicuous and is probably used by mothers to direct juveniles to follow them.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Display behavior====\nCheetahs engage in several [[Display (zoology)|displays]] during fights, hunting, or self-defense. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah will hold its head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=\"soc\">{{cite journal |last1=Wielebnowski |first1=N.

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

The store owner disputed this through an attorney who dismissed claims that the store traded him \"cigarillos for pot.\" The lawyer claimed \"[t]he reason he [Brown] gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they [the staff] wanted it back.\"<ref name=NYTimes.Wrinkle/> The store's attorney said the video had been in the hands of Brown's family and law enforcement since the initial investigation, and said the video had been edited to remove the portion where the store clerk returned Brown's package to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-market-disputes-claims-as-new-michael-brown-documentary-prompts/article_fc382406-dbd5-5f53-aeda-4de3f2d5d31e.html|title=Ferguson Market disputes claims as new Michael Brown documentary prompts new protest|work=stltoday.com|access-date=March 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313144849/http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-market-disputes-claims-as-new-michael-brown-documentary-prompts/article_fc382406-dbd5-5f53-aeda-4de3f2d5d31e.html|archive-date=March 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Following this, on March 13, 2017, unedited footage from the store was released by the St. Louis county prosecutor to try to settle questions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-video-about-death-of-michael-brown-rekindles-unrest-arrests/article_d484096d-dbe1-5818-b2c7-4a7c21fad2f3.html|title=Ferguson video about death of Michael Brown rekindles unrest, arrests|last=Currier|first=Christine Byers, Joel|work=stltoday.com|date=March 14, 2017|access-date=June 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606061156/http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-video-about-death-of-michael-brown-rekindles-unrest-arrests/article_d484096d-dbe1-5818-b2c7-4a7c21fad2f3.html|archive-date=June 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Incident ==\nAt {{nowrap|11:47 a.m.}}, Wilson responded to a call about a baby with breathing problems and drove to Glenark Drive, east of Canfield Drive.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> About three minutes later and several blocks away, Brown was recorded on camera stealing a box of Swisher cigars and forcefully shoving a Ferguson Market clerk. Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, left the market at about {{nowrap|11:54 a.m.}}<ref name=KWMU.Know/> At 11:53, a police dispatcher reported \"stealing in progress\" at the Ferguson Market and described the suspect as a black male wearing a white T-shirt running toward QuikTrip. The suspect was reported as having stolen a box of Swisher cigars.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> At 11:57, the dispatch described the suspect as wearing a red [[St. Louis Cardinals]] hat, a white T-shirt, yellow socks, and khaki shorts, and that he was accompanied by another male.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> At {{nowrap|12:00 p.m.}}, Wilson reported he was back in service and radioed units 25 and 22 to ask if they needed his assistance in searching for the suspects.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> Seven seconds later, an unidentified officer said the suspects had disappeared.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> Wilson called for backup at 12:02, saying \"[Unit] 21.

At noon on {{nowrap|August 9}}, Wilson drove up to Brown and Johnson as they were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive and ordered them to move off the street.

Paramedics covered the body with sheets. About {{nowrap|20 minutes}} after the shooting, the Ferguson Police Chief turned over the homicide investigation to the St. Louis County Police Department (SLCPD). The arrival of SLCPD detectives took about {{nowrap|70 minutes}}, as they were occupied with another crime scene {{nowrap|37 minutes}} away. On arrival at 1:30&nbsp;p.m., they put up privacy screens around the body. Their investigation was slowed due to safety concerns regarding the sound of gunfire in the area and some hostile members of the crowd encroaching on the crime scene. An investigator from the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's office arrived at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. Brown's body was removed at 4:00&nbsp;p.m.<ref>{{harvnb |USDOJ |2015 | pages=8\u20139}}, Section B.

The investigation concluded there was no evidence upon which prosecutors could rely to disprove Wilson's asserted belief that he feared for his safety, that witnesses who contradicted Wilson were not credible, that forensic evidence and credible witnesses corroborated Wilson's account, and that the facts did not support the filing of criminal charges against Wilson.<ref name=Yahoo.Feds/><ref name=NYTimes.Cleared/>{{sfn |USDOJ |2015 | p=12}} Credible witnesses did not support accounts that Brown had his hands up in surrender.

The two-lane street runs east to west, and has sidewalks and curbs on both sides. Immediately prior to the incident, Brown was walking eastbound on Canfield and Wilson was driving westbound. Evidence at the scene was generally clustered around Wilson's SUV on the western side of the scene and near Brown's body, which was in the eastern part of the area.\n{{center|'''Diagram of shooting scene'''{{R|STLToday.Map|NYTimes.Documents|NYTimes.Happened|WashPost.Collected}}}}\n[[File:Michael Brown shooting scene diagram.svg|frameless|1000px|center]]\n\nThe {{Convert|30|ft|adj=on}} western area included Wilson's police vehicle, which was angled slightly toward the right curb with its left-rear corner on the center line. Evidence included two bracelets, a baseball cap, and two [[.40 S&W|.40 caliber]] spent [[Cartridge (firearms)|casings]]. One of these casings was found at the western edge of the scene and the other was located near the rear driver's side of the police vehicle. There were two groups of red stains near the driver's side of the vehicle and a left [[flip-flops|sandal]] was also located in the vicinity. The right sandal was approximately {{Convert|44|ft}} east of the western area.\n\nThe eastern area, which was approximately {{Convert|124|ft}} east of the western area, was about {{Convert|29|ft}} wide. Brown's body was situated along the center-line of the road with his head oriented in a westerly direction. The distance from the driver's door of the SUV to Brown's head was about {{Convert|153|ft}}. Two groups of red stains were located at the extreme eastern edge of the scene, with the furthest under {{Convert|22|ft}} from Brown's feet.\n\nOne apparent projectile was found near the body. There were ten spent {{nowrap|.40-caliber}} casings scattered on the south side of the road near Brown's body. The distribution of the casings, combined with most of the casings being east of the body, was consistent with the officer moving backward while firing.<ref name=NYTimes.Documents/> Blood spatter approximately 25 feet behind Brown's body suggested he was moving toward Wilson when he was killed.<ref name=NYTimes.Happened/><ref name=NYTimes.Trusting/>\n\n=== DNA ===\nBrown's DNA was found on the gun.

According to Judy Melinek, a San Francisco pathologist who commented on the case as an expert, the official autopsy, which said Brown's hand had foreign matter consistent with a gun discharge on it, supported Wilson's testimony that Brown was reaching for the weapon,<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/> or indicated the gun was inches away from Brown's hand when it went off.<ref name=WashPost.Chaos/>\n\nAccording to the detective who performed tests on the gun, he had to decide whether to perform a DNA test or dust for fingerprints, because only one test can be performed without affecting the other.<ref name=WashPost.Chaos/> He found the gun stored in an unsealed envelope, contrary to the customary evidence-handling protocol.<ref name=WSJ.Testimony/> Documents released after the grand jury proceedings show Wilson washed blood from his hands and checked his own gun into an evidence bag, both actions described by media outlets as unorthodox procedures for such a case.<ref name=STLToday.Tidbits/><ref name=WashPost.Unorthodox/>\n\n===Autopsies===\nThree autopsies{{refn|group=note|\nCounty autopsy report: \n::{{cite web |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1371273-2014-5143-autopsy-report.html\n |title=Post-Mortem Examination \u2013 Exam Case 2104\u20135143 \u2013 Brown, Michael |publisher=St. Louis County Health, Office of the Medical Examiner |date= |via=DocumentCloud contribution by Eyder Peralta, NPR |access-date=September 13, 2016 }}\nIndependent autopsy report:\n::{{cite web |url=http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1370608-michael-brown-private-autopsy-report.html\n |title=Autopsy Report \u2013 Michael Brown |publisher= |via=DocumentCloud contribution by CNN Digital |access-date=September 13, 2016 }}\nFederal autopsy report:\n::{{cite web |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1376606-me-14-0240.html\n |title=Autopsy Report \u2013 Autopsy Number ME14-0240 \u2013 Brown, Michael\n |publisher=Department of Defense, Armed Forces Medical Examiner System, Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner |via=DocumentCloud contribution by News desk, The Guardian |access-date=September 13, 2016 }} \n}} were performed on Brown's body, with all three noting Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

When Mary Case, the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County medical examiner, was asked to provide details, she declined to comment further, citing the ongoing investigation into Brown's death.<ref name=NYTimes.Accounts/><ref name=WashPost.County/> The official county autopsy was later leaked to the ''{{nowrap|St. Louis}} Post-Dispatch''.<ref name=PBS.Autopsy/><ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/>\n\nThe narrative report of investigation from the office of the medical examiner of {{nowrap|St. Louis}} agreed with Wilson's testimony.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/> It noted Brown had sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the head, torso, and right arm, as well as a single gunshot wound to the inside of his right hand near his thumb and palm; it also noted Brown's body had [[abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] to the right side of his face and on the back of his left hand.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/>\n\nThe autopsy noted the absence of [[stippling]], powder burns around a wound that indicate a shot was fired at a relatively short range. Michael Graham notes gunshot wounds within an inch of the body do not always cause stippling. Microscopic examination of tissue taken from the thumb wound detected the presence of a foreign material consistent with the material which is ejected from a gun while firing.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/> The gunshot wound to the top of Brown's head was consistent with Brown either falling forward or being in a lunging position; the shot was instantly fatal.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/>\n\nA toxicology test performed by a {{nowrap|St. Louis}} University laboratory revealed the presence of [[THC]], the active ingredient in [[marijuana]], in Brown's blood and urine. The presence of THC indicates Brown had used marijuana within a few hours of his death, but it could not be determined whether or not Brown was impaired at the time of his death.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/>\n\n====Independent====\nAt the request of Brown's family, on {{nowrap|August 17}} a preliminary autopsy was conducted by [[Michael Baden]], a former chief medical examiner for the City of New York (1978\u20131979). This autopsy was limited because the previous county autopsy had washed, embalmed, and taken evidence off the body.<ref name=KTVI.Baden/><ref name=USAToday.Pathologist/><ref name=CNN.Transcript/><ref name=PBS.Evidence/>\n\nAccording to Baden's report, Brown was shot six times into his front: four of the bullets entered his right arm, one entered his right eye on a downward trajectory, and one entered the top of his skull.<ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/> All of the rounds were fired from a distance of at least one foot.<ref name=LATimes.Autopsy/> One of the shots shattered his right eye, traveled through his face, then exited his jaw and reentered his collarbone. The shot that entered the top of his skull caused the fatal injury.<ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/> Brown could have survived the first bullet wounds, but the bullet that entered the top of his head resulted in a fatal injury.<ref name=SeattleTimes.Hands/>\n\nBaden had no access to the clothing of the victim, and had not yet seen the x-rays showing where bullets were in the body. He could not determine if any gunpowder residue was on that clothing. Baden concluded there was too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.<ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/> At least two commentators noted the results of both autopsies contradicted some aspects of some eyewitness accounts, which had reported Wilson shot Brown in the back<ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/> and that Wilson shot Brown while holding Brown's neck.<ref name=WashPost.Autopsy/> In later analysis, Baden reclassified one of Brown's chest wounds as an entry wound.<ref name=KSDK.Crump/>\n\nBaden was assisted by Shawn Parcells, who does not have a degree or other credentials in medicine or pathology.<ref name=WDAF.Credentials/><ref name=KCStar.Assistant/> Thomas Young, former [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] Medical Examiner, said Parcells is giving out forensic pathology opinions when he is not qualified to do so.<ref name=WDAF.Credentials/> Mary Case, who performed the initial autopsy, said Parcells' involvement could cause issues with the second autopsy.<ref name=KMBC.Pathologist/> Parcells said all he did was assist Baden.<ref name=KMBC.Pathologist/>\n\n====Federal====\nAttorney General Holder ordered a third autopsy of Brown's body.<ref name=STLToday.Holder/><ref name=CBS.Autopsy/> Its findings matched the other two autopsies, but its detailed findings were initially withheld from the public due to the ongoing investigation.<ref name=NYTimes.Accounts/><ref name=LATimes.Documents/> The federal autopsy report was among a group of documents released by the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County Prosecutor's Office on {{nowrap|December 8}}, two weeks after the grand jury chose not to indict Wilson.<ref name=LATimes.Documents/><ref name=LATimes.FederalAutopsy/>\n\n===Audio recording of gunshots===\nOn {{nowrap|August 27}}, CNN released an audio recording purported to contain the sounds of the shooting.<ref name=CNN.Analyzing/><ref name=CNN.Audio/> The recording was made by an anonymous third-party who happened to be recording a video-text message at the time of the incident.<ref name=NBC.Probing/> [[Glide (software)|Glide]], a video messaging service, confirmed the audio had been recorded on their site at {{nowrap|12:02 p.m.}} on the day of the shooting.<ref name=CNN.Captured/><ref name=Glide.Verifies/> The twelve-second recording contains a series of shots, a short pause, and then a second series of shots.<ref name=NBC.Probing/>\n\nForensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg says he heard six shots, a pause, and then four additional shots. Ginsberg said, \"I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired. And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.\"<ref name=CNN.Audio/> CNN's law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes noted most accounts of the shooting say there was a single shot earlier in the incident near the vehicle that is not audible in the recording.<ref name=CNN.Alleged/><ref name=WashPost.Audio/> The recording was also analyzed by [[ShotSpotter|SST, Inc.]], a company specializing in [[gunfire locator]] technology.

The company's analysis also said all ten rounds were fired from within a radius of {{convert|3|ft|m}}, indicating the shooter was not moving.<ref name=WashPost.Acoustic/>\n\n=== Handling ===\n\n''The Washington Post'' said there were unorthodox forensic practices shown in the published testimony of Wilson and other law enforcement officials. It said Wilson washed blood off of his hands without photographing them first. It also said Wilson submitted his gun to evidence by himself, and that initial interviews of Wilson were conducted with other personnel present and were not taped. It described Wilson's face injuries after the shooting as photographed by a local detective at the Fraternal Order of Police building, instead of at Ferguson Police headquarters. An investigator with the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County Medical Examiner's office testified he decided not to take measurements at the crime scene nor did he photograph the scene, instead relying on photographs taken by the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County Police Department.<ref name=BostonGlobe.Unorthodox/>\n\n== Witness accounts ==\n\nMultiple witnesses saw part or all of the event and have given interviews to the media, testified to the grand jury, and were interviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice.

The witnesses that claimed Brown was surrendering or did not move toward Wilson were not credible; the report said their claims were inconsistent with the physical evidence, other witness statements, and in some cases prior statements from the same witness. No witness statements that pointed to Wilson's guilt were determined to be credible. Twenty-four statements were determined to lack any credibility, while eight which were found credible corroborated Wilson's account. Nine did not completely contradict nor corroborate Wilson's account.<ref name=NYTimes.Cleared/> Several witnesses reported fear of reprisals from the community for providing evidence that corroborated Wilson's account.<ref name=NYTimes.Cleared/>\n\n===Wilson's interview and testimony===\n[[File:Darren wilson bruise.jpg|thumb|Bruising on Wilson's face after the shooting]]\nWilson gave his account of the incident in an interview with a detective on {{nowrap|August 10}}, and in testimony before the grand jury in September. Wilson said he had just left a call involving a sick person when he heard on his radio that there was a theft in progress at a local convenience store. Wilson heard the description of the suspects and soon after observed two black males walking down the middle of the street. Wilson pulled up to them and told the two to walk on the sidewalk, and Johnson replied, \"we're almost to our destination\". As they passed his window, Brown said \"fuck what you have to say\".<ref name=CBS.Documents/>\n\nWilson then backed up about ten feet to where they were and attempted to open his door. After backing up, Wilson told the two to \"come here\", and Brown told him in reply, \"what the fuck are you gonna do\". Wilson shut the door and Brown approached him and he opened the door again \"trying to push him back\", while telling him to get back. Brown \"started swinging and punching at me from outside the vehicle\", and Brown had his body against the door. Wilson said the first strike from Brown was a \"glancing blow\", and at that point he was trying to get Brown's arms out of his face. This was when Brown turned to his left and handed Johnson several packs of the stolen cigarillos he had been holding.<ref name=CBS.Documents/> Wilson then grabbed Brown's right arm trying to get control, but Brown hit him in the face. Wilson said he \"felt like a 5-year-old holding onto [[Hulk Hogan]]\" while he attempted to restrain Brown when he reached through his police car window.<ref name=Bloomberg.HulkHogan/> Wilson said it \"jarred\" him back and he yelled at Brown numerous times to stop and get back. Wilson said he thought about using his mace and his [[Expandable baton|baton]], but he was unable to reach either of them. He then drew his weapon and pointed it at Brown and told him to stop or he would shoot him, while ordering him to the ground.<ref name=CBS.Documents/>\n\nAccording to Wilson, Brown then said \"you're too much of a fucking pussy to shoot me\" and grabbed for his gun and twisted it, pointing it at him, into his hip area. Wilson placed his left hand against Brown's hand and his other hand on the gun and pushed forward with both his arms. The gun was somewhat lined up with Brown, and Wilson pulled the trigger twice, but the weapon failed to discharge. On the next try, the gun fired and Brown then attempted to hit him multiple times inside his vehicle. Wilson shot at Brown again, but missed and he took off running east, while Wilson exited his vehicle and radioed for backup. Wilson followed him, yelling for him to stop and get on the ground, but he kept running. Brown eventually stopped and turned and made a \"grunting noise\" and started running at him with his right hand under his shirt in his waistband. Brown ignored Wilson's commands to stop and get on the ground, so Wilson fired multiple shots at him, paused and yelled at him to get on the ground again, but Brown was still charging at him and had not slowed down. Wilson then fired another set of shots, but Brown was still running at him. When Brown was about eight to ten feet away, Wilson fired more shots, with one of those hitting Brown in the head, which brought him down with his hand still in his waistband. Wilson said two patrol cars showed up approximately fifteen to twenty seconds after the final shot. When his supervisor arrived, he was sent to the police station.<ref name=CBS.Documents/>\n\nWilson told detectives Brown had reached his right hand into his waistband and that the hand still appeared to be in the waistband after Brown was shot. The medical investigator at the scene of the shooting did not take any photographs and testified to the grand jury that Brown's left hand was under his dead body, near the waistband, and the right hand was extended outwards.<ref name=CNN.Testimony/>\n\nOn {{nowrap|November 26}}, Wilson gave his first public interview about the shooting to [[ABC News]]' [[George Stephanopoulos]].<ref name=ABC.Discusses/>\n\n===Corroborating Wilson's testimony===\nNumerous witness accounts were consistent with Wilson's account and also agreed with the physical evidence at hand. Many witnesses corroborated that Wilson acted in self-defense during the event. A number of the witnesses who corroborated Wilson's account of events expressed fear and apprehension in testifying, saying they had been harassed or threatened by individuals from the Ferguson community.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|pp.27\u201334}} The following are a sample of the witnesses whose accounts aligned with Wilson's testimony.\n\nWitness 102 was a 27-year-old biracial male. He said he saw Wilson chase Brown until Brown abruptly turned around. Brown did not put his hands up in surrender but made some type of movement similar to pulling his pants up or a shoulder shrug and then made a full charge at Wilson. Witness 102 thought Wilson's life was threatened and he only fired shots when Brown was coming toward him.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|pp.27\u201328}}\n\nAfter the shooting, Witness 102 remained in the neighborhood for a short period of time, and corrected a couple of people who claimed Wilson \"stood over [Brown] and shot while [he was] on the ground\". In response, Witness 102 said Wilson shot Brown because Brown came back toward Wilson. Witness 102 \"kept thinking\" Wilson's shots were \"missing\" Brown because Brown kept moving.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.28}} Witness 102 did not stay in the neighborhood for long, and left the area shortly afterward because he felt uncomfortable. According to the witness, \"crowds of people had begun to gather, wrongly claiming the police shot Brown for no reason and that he had his hands up in surrender\". Two black women approached Witness 102, mobile phones set to record, asking him to recount what he had witnessed. Witness 102 responded that they would not like what he had to say. The women responded with racial slurs, calling him names like 'white motherfucker'.\"<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.28}}\n\nWitness 103, a 58-year-old black male, testified that from his parked truck he saw \"Brown punching Wilson at least three times in the facial area, through the open driver's window of the SUV... Wilson and Brown [had] hold of each other's shirts, but Brown was 'getting in a couple of blows [on Wilson]'.\"<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.29}} Wilson was leaning back toward the passenger seat with his forearm up, in an effort to block the blows. Then Witness 103 heard a gunshot and Brown took off running. Wilson exited the SUV, appeared to be using his shoulder microphone to call into his radio, and chased Brown with his gun held low ... Brown came to a stop near a car, put his hand down on the car, and turned around to face Wilson. Brown's hands were then down at his sides. Witness 103 did not see Brown's hands up. Wanting to leave, Witness 103 began to turn his car around in the opposite direction that Brown had been running when he heard additional shots. Witness 103 turned to his right, and saw Brown \"moving fast\" toward Wilson. Witness 103 then drove away.\"<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.29}}\n\nWitness 104, a 26-year-old biracial female, witnessed the end of the altercation from a minivan:\n\n<blockquote>[Witness 104] saw Brown run from the SUV, followed by Wilson, who \"hopped\" out of the SUV and ran after him while yelling \"stop, stop, stop\". Wilson did not fire his gun as Brown ran from him. Brown then turned around and \"for a second\" began to raise his hands as though he may have considered surrendering, but then quickly \"balled up in fists\" in a running position and \"charged\" at Wilson. Witness 104 described it as a \"tackle run\", explaining Brown \"wasn't going to stop\". Wilson fired his gun only as Brown charged at him, backing up as Brown came toward him. Witness 104 explained there were three separate volleys of shots. Each time, Brown ran toward Wilson, Wilson fired, Brown paused, Wilson stopped firing, and then Brown charged again. The pattern continued until Brown fell to the ground, \"smashing\" his face upon impact. Wilson did not fire while Brown momentarily had his hands up. Witness 104 explained it took some time for Wilson to fire, adding that she \"would have fired sooner\". Wilson did not go near Brown's body after Brown fell to his death.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.30}}</blockquote>\n\nWitness 108, a 74-year-old black male, told detectives the police officer was \"in the right\" and \"did what he had to do\", and that statements made by people in the apartment complex about Brown surrendering were inaccurate. Witness 108 later told investigators he \"would have fucking shot that boy, too\", and mimicked the aggressive stance Brown made while charging Wilson. He explained Wilson told Brown to \"stop\" or \"get down\" at least ten times, but instead Brown \"charged\" at Wilson. Witness 108 also told detectives there were other witnesses on Canfield Drive who saw what he saw.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.32}}\n\nWitness 109, a 53-year-old black male, said he decided to come forward after seeing Dorian Johnson \"lie\" about the events on television.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.32}} He said when Wilson asked the two boys to get out of the street, Brown responded something to the effect of \"Fuck the police.\" Afterward, Wilson got out of his car and Brown hit him in the face. Witness 109 said he saw Wilson reach for his taser but dropped it and then grabbed a gun, after which Brown grabbed for Wilson's gun. According to 109, at one point Brown ran away from Wilson, but turned around and charged toward the officer. He said Wilson fired in self-defense, and did not appear to be shooting to kill at first.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.33}}\n\nWitness 113, a 31-year-old black female, made statements that corroborated Wilson's account. She said she was afraid of the \"neighborhood backlash\" that might come from her testimony, and feared offering an account contrary to the narrative reported by the media that Brown held his hands up in surrender.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|pp.33\u201334}} She also told investigators she thought Wilson's life was in danger.\n\nWitness 136 was in his apartment using a video chat application on his mobile phone while the shooting occurred. After hearing the first few shots, he recorded the remainder of his chat on his phone and turned it over to the FBI. The recording is about 12 seconds long and captured a total of 10 gunshots. The gunshots begin after the first four seconds. The recording captured six gunshots in two seconds. After a three-second pause, a seventh gunshot is heard. A pause of less than one second gave way to the final three-shot volley within two seconds. The recording was not time-stamped. As detailed below, this recording is consistent with several credible witness accounts as well as Wilson's account, that he fired several volleys of shots, briefly pausing between each one.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|pp.24\u201325}}\n\n===Contradicting Wilson's testimony===\nSeveral witnesses who originally testified against Wilson were also interviewed by the prosecution.

The American grand jury process operates in secret, with the proceedings, evidence and testimony rarely being released to the public in cases of no indictment. From the beginning, McCulloch desired to provide transparency to the process and had the proceeding transcribed with the intention of releasing the materials to the public if there was no indictment. [[Paul G. Cassell|Paul Cassell]], former U.S. federal judge, said the investigative grand jury was unique because they were investigating with no assurance that any criminal conduct was present, in contrast to normal grand jury proceedings which have been screened for probable cause by a prosecutor. McCulloch's intentions to present all the evidence resulted in the proceedings which took far longer than regular grand juries which decide within days.<ref name=WashPost.Fair/>\n\nEarlier in the hearing, the prosecution presented a 1979 Missouri statute allowing officers to use deadly force \"to effect the arrest or prevent the escape from custody [of a person]\". Before the grand jury deliberated, jurors were told to disregard the previous instructions and use case law from the [[Tennessee v Garner]] ruling, which said it was unconstitutional for police officers to use deadly force to apprehend non-dangerous fleeing suspects.<ref name=KWMU.Wrangled/> Missouri Attorney General [[Chris Koster]], acknowledged the grand jury was given information based on the state law before being informed that deadly force cannot be used merely to prevent the escape of an unarmed suspect.<ref name=KWMU.Wrangled /><ref name=RawStory.Misled/> ''[[MSNBC]]'s'' [[Lawrence O'Donnell]] argued that this change amounted to a deliberate attempt by the prosecution to make it impossible to indict Wilson.<ref name=Donnell.Last>{{cite AV media | title=The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell \u2013 \"Rewrite\" segment | publisher=MSNBC | date=November 26, 2014 | medium=Television}}</ref> Andrew F. Branca, a Massachusetts lawyer focusing on self-defense law, attributed O'Donnell's comments as a [[straw man]] because self-defense is a completely independent and sufficient justification for the use of deadly force.<ref name=LegalInsurrection.Decision/> The {{nowrap|St. Louis}} Public Radio later clarified that even if Wilson was indicted and convicted at trial based on the Garner ruling, the conviction could be challenged on the basis that Missouri law permitted the use of deadly force.<ref name=KWMU.Wrangled />\n\nThe prosecution's handling of the case received particular attention. Roger Parloff said prosecutors do not usually exclude truly exculpatory evidence and that prosecutors do not typically indict if they believe the accused is not guilty, disagreeing with the notion that McCulloch should have presented evidence with the purpose of obtaining an indictment.<ref name=Fortune.Deaths/> Jay Sterling Silver said the grand jury case indicated a conflict of interest between local prosecutors and police, as the former needs to maintain a good relationship with law enforcement.<ref name=TimesDispatch.Silver /> [[Mark O'Mara]] said the unusual process was to avoid arguments that the presentation was to effect a particular result, yet despite this McCulloch was still criticized for the decision. Paul Callan, former deputy chief of homicide in the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, gave a layered response which asserted the choice to present all the evidence was unusual, but not unprecedented in controversial cases.

The store owner disputed this through an attorney who dismissed claims that the store traded him \"cigarillos for pot.\" The lawyer claimed \"[t]he reason he [Brown] gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they [the staff] wanted it back.\"<ref name=NYTimes.Wrinkle/> The store's attorney said the video had been in the hands of Brown's family and law enforcement since the initial investigation, and said the video had been edited to remove the portion where the store clerk returned Brown's package to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-market-disputes-claims-as-new-michael-brown-documentary-prompts/article_fc382406-dbd5-5f53-aeda-4de3f2d5d31e.html|title=Ferguson Market disputes claims as new Michael Brown documentary prompts new protest|work=stltoday.com|access-date=March 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313144849/http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-market-disputes-claims-as-new-michael-brown-documentary-prompts/article_fc382406-dbd5-5f53-aeda-4de3f2d5d31e.html|archive-date=March 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Following this, on March 13, 2017, unedited footage from the store was released by the St. Louis county prosecutor to try to settle questions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-video-about-death-of-michael-brown-rekindles-unrest-arrests/article_d484096d-dbe1-5818-b2c7-4a7c21fad2f3.html|title=Ferguson video about death of Michael Brown rekindles unrest, arrests|last=Currier|first=Christine Byers, Joel|work=stltoday.com|date=March 14, 2017|access-date=June 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606061156/http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-video-about-death-of-michael-brown-rekindles-unrest-arrests/article_d484096d-dbe1-5818-b2c7-4a7c21fad2f3.html|archive-date=June 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Incident ==\nAt {{nowrap|11:47 a.m.}}, Wilson responded to a call about a baby with breathing problems and drove to Glenark Drive, east of Canfield Drive.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> About three minutes later and several blocks away, Brown was recorded on camera stealing a box of Swisher cigars and forcefully shoving a Ferguson Market clerk. Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, left the market at about {{nowrap|11:54 a.m.}}<ref name=KWMU.Know/> At 11:53, a police dispatcher reported \"stealing in progress\" at the Ferguson Market and described the suspect as a black male wearing a white T-shirt running toward QuikTrip. The suspect was reported as having stolen a box of Swisher cigars.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> At 11:57, the dispatch described the suspect as wearing a red [[St. Louis Cardinals]] hat, a white T-shirt, yellow socks, and khaki shorts, and that he was accompanied by another male.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> At {{nowrap|12:00 p.m.}}, Wilson reported he was back in service and radioed units 25 and 22 to ask if they needed his assistance in searching for the suspects.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> Seven seconds later, an unidentified officer said the suspects had disappeared.<ref name=STLToday.Radio/> Wilson called for backup at 12:02, saying \"[Unit] 21.

At noon on {{nowrap|August 9}}, Wilson drove up to Brown and Johnson as they were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive and ordered them to move off the street.

Paramedics covered the body with sheets. About {{nowrap|20 minutes}} after the shooting, the Ferguson Police Chief turned over the homicide investigation to the St. Louis County Police Department (SLCPD). The arrival of SLCPD detectives took about {{nowrap|70 minutes}}, as they were occupied with another crime scene {{nowrap|37 minutes}} away. On arrival at 1:30&nbsp;p.m., they put up privacy screens around the body. Their investigation was slowed due to safety concerns regarding the sound of gunfire in the area and some hostile members of the crowd encroaching on the crime scene. An investigator from the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's office arrived at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. Brown's body was removed at 4:00&nbsp;p.m.<ref>{{harvnb |USDOJ |2015 | pages=8\u20139}}, Section B.

The investigation concluded there was no evidence upon which prosecutors could rely to disprove Wilson's asserted belief that he feared for his safety, that witnesses who contradicted Wilson were not credible, that forensic evidence and credible witnesses corroborated Wilson's account, and that the facts did not support the filing of criminal charges against Wilson.<ref name=Yahoo.Feds/><ref name=NYTimes.Cleared/>{{sfn |USDOJ |2015 | p=12}} Credible witnesses did not support accounts that Brown had his hands up in surrender.

The two-lane street runs east to west, and has sidewalks and curbs on both sides. Immediately prior to the incident, Brown was walking eastbound on Canfield and Wilson was driving westbound. Evidence at the scene was generally clustered around Wilson's SUV on the western side of the scene and near Brown's body, which was in the eastern part of the area.\n{{center|'''Diagram of shooting scene'''{{R|STLToday.Map|NYTimes.Documents|NYTimes.Happened|WashPost.Collected}}}}\n[[File:Michael Brown shooting scene diagram.svg|frameless|1000px|center]]\n\nThe {{Convert|30|ft|adj=on}} western area included Wilson's police vehicle, which was angled slightly toward the right curb with its left-rear corner on the center line. Evidence included two bracelets, a baseball cap, and two [[.40 S&W|.40 caliber]] spent [[Cartridge (firearms)|casings]]. One of these casings was found at the western edge of the scene and the other was located near the rear driver's side of the police vehicle. There were two groups of red stains near the driver's side of the vehicle and a left [[flip-flops|sandal]] was also located in the vicinity. The right sandal was approximately {{Convert|44|ft}} east of the western area.\n\nThe eastern area, which was approximately {{Convert|124|ft}} east of the western area, was about {{Convert|29|ft}} wide. Brown's body was situated along the center-line of the road with his head oriented in a westerly direction. The distance from the driver's door of the SUV to Brown's head was about {{Convert|153|ft}}. Two groups of red stains were located at the extreme eastern edge of the scene, with the furthest under {{Convert|22|ft}} from Brown's feet.\n\nOne apparent projectile was found near the body. There were ten spent {{nowrap|.40-caliber}} casings scattered on the south side of the road near Brown's body. The distribution of the casings, combined with most of the casings being east of the body, was consistent with the officer moving backward while firing.<ref name=NYTimes.Documents/> Blood spatter approximately 25 feet behind Brown's body suggested he was moving toward Wilson when he was killed.<ref name=NYTimes.Happened/><ref name=NYTimes.Trusting/>\n\n=== DNA ===\nBrown's DNA was found on the gun.

According to Judy Melinek, a San Francisco pathologist who commented on the case as an expert, the official autopsy, which said Brown's hand had foreign matter consistent with a gun discharge on it, supported Wilson's testimony that Brown was reaching for the weapon,<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/> or indicated the gun was inches away from Brown's hand when it went off.<ref name=WashPost.Chaos/>\n\nAccording to the detective who performed tests on the gun, he had to decide whether to perform a DNA test or dust for fingerprints, because only one test can be performed without affecting the other.<ref name=WashPost.Chaos/> He found the gun stored in an unsealed envelope, contrary to the customary evidence-handling protocol.<ref name=WSJ.Testimony/> Documents released after the grand jury proceedings show Wilson washed blood from his hands and checked his own gun into an evidence bag, both actions described by media outlets as unorthodox procedures for such a case.<ref name=STLToday.Tidbits/><ref name=WashPost.Unorthodox/>\n\n===Autopsies===\nThree autopsies{{refn|group=note|\nCounty autopsy report: \n::{{cite web |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1371273-2014-5143-autopsy-report.html\n |title=Post-Mortem Examination \u2013 Exam Case 2104\u20135143 \u2013 Brown, Michael |publisher=St. Louis County Health, Office of the Medical Examiner |date= |via=DocumentCloud contribution by Eyder Peralta, NPR |access-date=September 13, 2016 }}\nIndependent autopsy report:\n::{{cite web |url=http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1370608-michael-brown-private-autopsy-report.html\n |title=Autopsy Report \u2013 Michael Brown |publisher= |via=DocumentCloud contribution by CNN Digital |access-date=September 13, 2016 }}\nFederal autopsy report:\n::{{cite web |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1376606-me-14-0240.html\n |title=Autopsy Report \u2013 Autopsy Number ME14-0240 \u2013 Brown, Michael\n |publisher=Department of Defense, Armed Forces Medical Examiner System, Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner |via=DocumentCloud contribution by News desk, The Guardian |access-date=September 13, 2016 }} \n}} were performed on Brown's body, with all three noting Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

When Mary Case, the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County medical examiner, was asked to provide details, she declined to comment further, citing the ongoing investigation into Brown's death.<ref name=NYTimes.Accounts/><ref name=WashPost.County/> The official county autopsy was later leaked to the ''{{nowrap|St. Louis}} Post-Dispatch''.<ref name=PBS.Autopsy/><ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/>\n\nThe narrative report of investigation from the office of the medical examiner of {{nowrap|St. Louis}} agreed with Wilson's testimony.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/> It noted Brown had sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the head, torso, and right arm, as well as a single gunshot wound to the inside of his right hand near his thumb and palm; it also noted Brown's body had [[abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] to the right side of his face and on the back of his left hand.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/>\n\nThe autopsy noted the absence of [[stippling]], powder burns around a wound that indicate a shot was fired at a relatively short range. Michael Graham notes gunshot wounds within an inch of the body do not always cause stippling. Microscopic examination of tissue taken from the thumb wound detected the presence of a foreign material consistent with the material which is ejected from a gun while firing.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/> The gunshot wound to the top of Brown's head was consistent with Brown either falling forward or being in a lunging position; the shot was instantly fatal.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/>\n\nA toxicology test performed by a {{nowrap|St. Louis}} University laboratory revealed the presence of [[THC]], the active ingredient in [[marijuana]], in Brown's blood and urine. The presence of THC indicates Brown had used marijuana within a few hours of his death, but it could not be determined whether or not Brown was impaired at the time of his death.<ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/>\n\n====Independent====\nAt the request of Brown's family, on {{nowrap|August 17}} a preliminary autopsy was conducted by [[Michael Baden]], a former chief medical examiner for the City of New York (1978\u20131979). This autopsy was limited because the previous county autopsy had washed, embalmed, and taken evidence off the body.<ref name=KTVI.Baden/><ref name=USAToday.Pathologist/><ref name=CNN.Transcript/><ref name=PBS.Evidence/>\n\nAccording to Baden's report, Brown was shot six times into his front: four of the bullets entered his right arm, one entered his right eye on a downward trajectory, and one entered the top of his skull.<ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/> All of the rounds were fired from a distance of at least one foot.<ref name=LATimes.Autopsy/> One of the shots shattered his right eye, traveled through his face, then exited his jaw and reentered his collarbone. The shot that entered the top of his skull caused the fatal injury.<ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/> Brown could have survived the first bullet wounds, but the bullet that entered the top of his head resulted in a fatal injury.<ref name=SeattleTimes.Hands/>\n\nBaden had no access to the clothing of the victim, and had not yet seen the x-rays showing where bullets were in the body. He could not determine if any gunpowder residue was on that clothing. Baden concluded there was too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.<ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/> At least two commentators noted the results of both autopsies contradicted some aspects of some eyewitness accounts, which had reported Wilson shot Brown in the back<ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/> and that Wilson shot Brown while holding Brown's neck.<ref name=WashPost.Autopsy/> In later analysis, Baden reclassified one of Brown's chest wounds as an entry wound.<ref name=KSDK.Crump/>\n\nBaden was assisted by Shawn Parcells, who does not have a degree or other credentials in medicine or pathology.<ref name=WDAF.Credentials/><ref name=KCStar.Assistant/> Thomas Young, former [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] Medical Examiner, said Parcells is giving out forensic pathology opinions when he is not qualified to do so.<ref name=WDAF.Credentials/> Mary Case, who performed the initial autopsy, said Parcells' involvement could cause issues with the second autopsy.<ref name=KMBC.Pathologist/> Parcells said all he did was assist Baden.<ref name=KMBC.Pathologist/>\n\n====Federal====\nAttorney General Holder ordered a third autopsy of Brown's body.<ref name=STLToday.Holder/><ref name=CBS.Autopsy/> Its findings matched the other two autopsies, but its detailed findings were initially withheld from the public due to the ongoing investigation.<ref name=NYTimes.Accounts/><ref name=LATimes.Documents/> The federal autopsy report was among a group of documents released by the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County Prosecutor's Office on {{nowrap|December 8}}, two weeks after the grand jury chose not to indict Wilson.<ref name=LATimes.Documents/><ref name=LATimes.FederalAutopsy/>\n\n===Audio recording of gunshots===\nOn {{nowrap|August 27}}, CNN released an audio recording purported to contain the sounds of the shooting.<ref name=CNN.Analyzing/><ref name=CNN.Audio/> The recording was made by an anonymous third-party who happened to be recording a video-text message at the time of the incident.<ref name=NBC.Probing/> [[Glide (software)|Glide]], a video messaging service, confirmed the audio had been recorded on their site at {{nowrap|12:02 p.m.}} on the day of the shooting.<ref name=CNN.Captured/><ref name=Glide.Verifies/> The twelve-second recording contains a series of shots, a short pause, and then a second series of shots.<ref name=NBC.Probing/>\n\nForensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg says he heard six shots, a pause, and then four additional shots. Ginsberg said, \"I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired. And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.\"<ref name=CNN.Audio/> CNN's law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes noted most accounts of the shooting say there was a single shot earlier in the incident near the vehicle that is not audible in the recording.<ref name=CNN.Alleged/><ref name=WashPost.Audio/> The recording was also analyzed by [[ShotSpotter|SST, Inc.]], a company specializing in [[gunfire locator]] technology.

The company's analysis also said all ten rounds were fired from within a radius of {{convert|3|ft|m}}, indicating the shooter was not moving.<ref name=WashPost.Acoustic/>\n\n=== Handling ===\n\n''The Washington Post'' said there were unorthodox forensic practices shown in the published testimony of Wilson and other law enforcement officials. It said Wilson washed blood off of his hands without photographing them first. It also said Wilson submitted his gun to evidence by himself, and that initial interviews of Wilson were conducted with other personnel present and were not taped. It described Wilson's face injuries after the shooting as photographed by a local detective at the Fraternal Order of Police building, instead of at Ferguson Police headquarters. An investigator with the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County Medical Examiner's office testified he decided not to take measurements at the crime scene nor did he photograph the scene, instead relying on photographs taken by the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County Police Department.<ref name=BostonGlobe.Unorthodox/>\n\n== Witness accounts ==\n\nMultiple witnesses saw part or all of the event and have given interviews to the media, testified to the grand jury, and were interviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice.

The witnesses that claimed Brown was surrendering or did not move toward Wilson were not credible; the report said their claims were inconsistent with the physical evidence, other witness statements, and in some cases prior statements from the same witness. No witness statements that pointed to Wilson's guilt were determined to be credible. Twenty-four statements were determined to lack any credibility, while eight which were found credible corroborated Wilson's account. Nine did not completely contradict nor corroborate Wilson's account.<ref name=NYTimes.Cleared/> Several witnesses reported fear of reprisals from the community for providing evidence that corroborated Wilson's account.<ref name=NYTimes.Cleared/>\n\n===Wilson's interview and testimony===\n[[File:Darren wilson bruise.jpg|thumb|Bruising on Wilson's face after the shooting]]\nWilson gave his account of the incident in an interview with a detective on {{nowrap|August 10}}, and in testimony before the grand jury in September. Wilson said he had just left a call involving a sick person when he heard on his radio that there was a theft in progress at a local convenience store. Wilson heard the description of the suspects and soon after observed two black males walking down the middle of the street. Wilson pulled up to them and told the two to walk on the sidewalk, and Johnson replied, \"we're almost to our destination\". As they passed his window, Brown said \"fuck what you have to say\".<ref name=CBS.Documents/>\n\nWilson then backed up about ten feet to where they were and attempted to open his door. After backing up, Wilson told the two to \"come here\", and Brown told him in reply, \"what the fuck are you gonna do\". Wilson shut the door and Brown approached him and he opened the door again \"trying to push him back\", while telling him to get back. Brown \"started swinging and punching at me from outside the vehicle\", and Brown had his body against the door. Wilson said the first strike from Brown was a \"glancing blow\", and at that point he was trying to get Brown's arms out of his face. This was when Brown turned to his left and handed Johnson several packs of the stolen cigarillos he had been holding.<ref name=CBS.Documents/> Wilson then grabbed Brown's right arm trying to get control, but Brown hit him in the face. Wilson said he \"felt like a 5-year-old holding onto [[Hulk Hogan]]\" while he attempted to restrain Brown when he reached through his police car window.<ref name=Bloomberg.HulkHogan/> Wilson said it \"jarred\" him back and he yelled at Brown numerous times to stop and get back. Wilson said he thought about using his mace and his [[Expandable baton|baton]], but he was unable to reach either of them. He then drew his weapon and pointed it at Brown and told him to stop or he would shoot him, while ordering him to the ground.<ref name=CBS.Documents/>\n\nAccording to Wilson, Brown then said \"you're too much of a fucking pussy to shoot me\" and grabbed for his gun and twisted it, pointing it at him, into his hip area. Wilson placed his left hand against Brown's hand and his other hand on the gun and pushed forward with both his arms. The gun was somewhat lined up with Brown, and Wilson pulled the trigger twice, but the weapon failed to discharge. On the next try, the gun fired and Brown then attempted to hit him multiple times inside his vehicle. Wilson shot at Brown again, but missed and he took off running east, while Wilson exited his vehicle and radioed for backup. Wilson followed him, yelling for him to stop and get on the ground, but he kept running. Brown eventually stopped and turned and made a \"grunting noise\" and started running at him with his right hand under his shirt in his waistband. Brown ignored Wilson's commands to stop and get on the ground, so Wilson fired multiple shots at him, paused and yelled at him to get on the ground again, but Brown was still charging at him and had not slowed down. Wilson then fired another set of shots, but Brown was still running at him. When Brown was about eight to ten feet away, Wilson fired more shots, with one of those hitting Brown in the head, which brought him down with his hand still in his waistband. Wilson said two patrol cars showed up approximately fifteen to twenty seconds after the final shot. When his supervisor arrived, he was sent to the police station.<ref name=CBS.Documents/>\n\nWilson told detectives Brown had reached his right hand into his waistband and that the hand still appeared to be in the waistband after Brown was shot. The medical investigator at the scene of the shooting did not take any photographs and testified to the grand jury that Brown's left hand was under his dead body, near the waistband, and the right hand was extended outwards.<ref name=CNN.Testimony/>\n\nOn {{nowrap|November 26}}, Wilson gave his first public interview about the shooting to [[ABC News]]' [[George Stephanopoulos]].<ref name=ABC.Discusses/>\n\n===Corroborating Wilson's testimony===\nNumerous witness accounts were consistent with Wilson's account and also agreed with the physical evidence at hand. Many witnesses corroborated that Wilson acted in self-defense during the event. A number of the witnesses who corroborated Wilson's account of events expressed fear and apprehension in testifying, saying they had been harassed or threatened by individuals from the Ferguson community.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|pp.27\u201334}} The following are a sample of the witnesses whose accounts aligned with Wilson's testimony.\n\nWitness 102 was a 27-year-old biracial male. He said he saw Wilson chase Brown until Brown abruptly turned around. Brown did not put his hands up in surrender but made some type of movement similar to pulling his pants up or a shoulder shrug and then made a full charge at Wilson. Witness 102 thought Wilson's life was threatened and he only fired shots when Brown was coming toward him.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|pp.27\u201328}}\n\nAfter the shooting, Witness 102 remained in the neighborhood for a short period of time, and corrected a couple of people who claimed Wilson \"stood over [Brown] and shot while [he was] on the ground\". In response, Witness 102 said Wilson shot Brown because Brown came back toward Wilson. Witness 102 \"kept thinking\" Wilson's shots were \"missing\" Brown because Brown kept moving.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.28}} Witness 102 did not stay in the neighborhood for long, and left the area shortly afterward because he felt uncomfortable. According to the witness, \"crowds of people had begun to gather, wrongly claiming the police shot Brown for no reason and that he had his hands up in surrender\". Two black women approached Witness 102, mobile phones set to record, asking him to recount what he had witnessed. Witness 102 responded that they would not like what he had to say. The women responded with racial slurs, calling him names like 'white motherfucker'.\"<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.28}}\n\nWitness 103, a 58-year-old black male, testified that from his parked truck he saw \"Brown punching Wilson at least three times in the facial area, through the open driver's window of the SUV... Wilson and Brown [had] hold of each other's shirts, but Brown was 'getting in a couple of blows [on Wilson]'.\"<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.29}} Wilson was leaning back toward the passenger seat with his forearm up, in an effort to block the blows. Then Witness 103 heard a gunshot and Brown took off running. Wilson exited the SUV, appeared to be using his shoulder microphone to call into his radio, and chased Brown with his gun held low ... Brown came to a stop near a car, put his hand down on the car, and turned around to face Wilson. Brown's hands were then down at his sides. Witness 103 did not see Brown's hands up. Wanting to leave, Witness 103 began to turn his car around in the opposite direction that Brown had been running when he heard additional shots. Witness 103 turned to his right, and saw Brown \"moving fast\" toward Wilson. Witness 103 then drove away.\"<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.29}}\n\nWitness 104, a 26-year-old biracial female, witnessed the end of the altercation from a minivan:\n\n<blockquote>[Witness 104] saw Brown run from the SUV, followed by Wilson, who \"hopped\" out of the SUV and ran after him while yelling \"stop, stop, stop\". Wilson did not fire his gun as Brown ran from him. Brown then turned around and \"for a second\" began to raise his hands as though he may have considered surrendering, but then quickly \"balled up in fists\" in a running position and \"charged\" at Wilson. Witness 104 described it as a \"tackle run\", explaining Brown \"wasn't going to stop\". Wilson fired his gun only as Brown charged at him, backing up as Brown came toward him. Witness 104 explained there were three separate volleys of shots. Each time, Brown ran toward Wilson, Wilson fired, Brown paused, Wilson stopped firing, and then Brown charged again. The pattern continued until Brown fell to the ground, \"smashing\" his face upon impact. Wilson did not fire while Brown momentarily had his hands up. Witness 104 explained it took some time for Wilson to fire, adding that she \"would have fired sooner\". Wilson did not go near Brown's body after Brown fell to his death.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.30}}</blockquote>\n\nWitness 108, a 74-year-old black male, told detectives the police officer was \"in the right\" and \"did what he had to do\", and that statements made by people in the apartment complex about Brown surrendering were inaccurate. Witness 108 later told investigators he \"would have fucking shot that boy, too\", and mimicked the aggressive stance Brown made while charging Wilson. He explained Wilson told Brown to \"stop\" or \"get down\" at least ten times, but instead Brown \"charged\" at Wilson. Witness 108 also told detectives there were other witnesses on Canfield Drive who saw what he saw.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.32}}\n\nWitness 109, a 53-year-old black male, said he decided to come forward after seeing Dorian Johnson \"lie\" about the events on television.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.32}} He said when Wilson asked the two boys to get out of the street, Brown responded something to the effect of \"Fuck the police.\" Afterward, Wilson got out of his car and Brown hit him in the face. Witness 109 said he saw Wilson reach for his taser but dropped it and then grabbed a gun, after which Brown grabbed for Wilson's gun. According to 109, at one point Brown ran away from Wilson, but turned around and charged toward the officer. He said Wilson fired in self-defense, and did not appear to be shooting to kill at first.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|p.33}}\n\nWitness 113, a 31-year-old black female, made statements that corroborated Wilson's account. She said she was afraid of the \"neighborhood backlash\" that might come from her testimony, and feared offering an account contrary to the narrative reported by the media that Brown held his hands up in surrender.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|pp.33\u201334}} She also told investigators she thought Wilson's life was in danger.\n\nWitness 136 was in his apartment using a video chat application on his mobile phone while the shooting occurred. After hearing the first few shots, he recorded the remainder of his chat on his phone and turned it over to the FBI. The recording is about 12 seconds long and captured a total of 10 gunshots. The gunshots begin after the first four seconds. The recording captured six gunshots in two seconds. After a three-second pause, a seventh gunshot is heard. A pause of less than one second gave way to the final three-shot volley within two seconds. The recording was not time-stamped. As detailed below, this recording is consistent with several credible witness accounts as well as Wilson's account, that he fired several volleys of shots, briefly pausing between each one.<ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/>{{rp|pp.24\u201325}}\n\n===Contradicting Wilson's testimony===\nSeveral witnesses who originally testified against Wilson were also interviewed by the prosecution.

The American grand jury process operates in secret, with the proceedings, evidence and testimony rarely being released to the public in cases of no indictment. From the beginning, McCulloch desired to provide transparency to the process and had the proceeding transcribed with the intention of releasing the materials to the public if there was no indictment. [[Paul G. Cassell|Paul Cassell]], former U.S. federal judge, said the investigative grand jury was unique because they were investigating with no assurance that any criminal conduct was present, in contrast to normal grand jury proceedings which have been screened for probable cause by a prosecutor. McCulloch's intentions to present all the evidence resulted in the proceedings which took far longer than regular grand juries which decide within days.<ref name=WashPost.Fair/>\n\nEarlier in the hearing, the prosecution presented a 1979 Missouri statute allowing officers to use deadly force \"to effect the arrest or prevent the escape from custody [of a person]\". Before the grand jury deliberated, jurors were told to disregard the previous instructions and use case law from the [[Tennessee v Garner]] ruling, which said it was unconstitutional for police officers to use deadly force to apprehend non-dangerous fleeing suspects.<ref name=KWMU.Wrangled/> Missouri Attorney General [[Chris Koster]], acknowledged the grand jury was given information based on the state law before being informed that deadly force cannot be used merely to prevent the escape of an unarmed suspect.<ref name=KWMU.Wrangled /><ref name=RawStory.Misled/> ''[[MSNBC]]'s'' [[Lawrence O'Donnell]] argued that this change amounted to a deliberate attempt by the prosecution to make it impossible to indict Wilson.<ref name=Donnell.Last>{{cite AV media | title=The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell \u2013 \"Rewrite\" segment | publisher=MSNBC | date=November 26, 2014 | medium=Television}}</ref> Andrew F. Branca, a Massachusetts lawyer focusing on self-defense law, attributed O'Donnell's comments as a [[straw man]] because self-defense is a completely independent and sufficient justification for the use of deadly force.<ref name=LegalInsurrection.Decision/> The {{nowrap|St. Louis}} Public Radio later clarified that even if Wilson was indicted and convicted at trial based on the Garner ruling, the conviction could be challenged on the basis that Missouri law permitted the use of deadly force.<ref name=KWMU.Wrangled />\n\nThe prosecution's handling of the case received particular attention. Roger Parloff said prosecutors do not usually exclude truly exculpatory evidence and that prosecutors do not typically indict if they believe the accused is not guilty, disagreeing with the notion that McCulloch should have presented evidence with the purpose of obtaining an indictment.<ref name=Fortune.Deaths/> Jay Sterling Silver said the grand jury case indicated a conflict of interest between local prosecutors and police, as the former needs to maintain a good relationship with law enforcement.<ref name=TimesDispatch.Silver /> [[Mark O'Mara]] said the unusual process was to avoid arguments that the presentation was to effect a particular result, yet despite this McCulloch was still criticized for the decision. Paul Callan, former deputy chief of homicide in the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, gave a layered response which asserted the choice to present all the evidence was unusual, but not unprecedented in controversial cases.
