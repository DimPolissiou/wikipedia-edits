Underground, near Gollum's lair under the Misty Mountains, Bilbo accidentally finds a [[One Ring|magic ring of invisibility]] that, unbeknownst to him, belongs to Gollum. After playing a riddle game with Bilbo, Gollum plans to use the Ring to kill and eat Bilbo. Upon discovering that he has lost the Ring, Gollum deduces that Bilbo had it from his last riddle - \"What have I got in my pocket?\u201d - and chases after him, but by then Bilbo has discovered the Ring's power and disappeared. Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum, but spares his life out of pity and leaps over him to escape.<ref group=T name=\"Riddles\"/>\n\nBy the end of the journey, Bilbo has become wiser and more confident, having saved the day in many precarious situations. He rescues the Dwarves from giant spiders with the magic ring and a short [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Sting|Elven-sword]] that he had acquired. He uses the magic ring to sneak around in dangerous places, and he uses his wits to smuggle the 13 Dwarves out of the Wood-elves' prison. When tensions arose over ownership of the treasures beneath the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo uses the Arkenstone, a stolen heirloom jewel, as leverage in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a compromise between the Dwarves, the Wood-elves, and the Men of Lake-town. In so doing, Bilbo strains his relationship with Thorin; however, the two are reconciled at Thorin's deathbed following the Battle of the Five Armies. In addition to becoming wealthy from his share of the Dwarves' treasure, Bilbo finds that he has traded respectability for experience and wisdom.

Underground, near Gollum's lair under the Misty Mountains, Bilbo accidentally finds a [[One Ring|magic ring of invisibility]] that, unbeknownst to him, belongs to Gollum. After playing a riddle game with Bilbo, Gollum plans to use the Ring to kill and eat Bilbo. Upon discovering that he has lost the Ring, Gollum deduces that Bilbo had it from his last riddle - \"What have I got in my pocket?\u201d - and chases after him, but by then Bilbo has discovered the Ring's power and disappeared. Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum, but spares his life out of pity and leaps over him to escape.<ref group=T name=\"Riddles\"/>\n\nBy the end of the journey, Bilbo has become wiser and more confident, having saved the day in many precarious situations. He rescues the Dwarves from giant spiders with the magic ring and a short [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Sting|Elven-sword]] that he had acquired. He uses the magic ring to sneak around in dangerous places, and he uses his wits to smuggle the 13 Dwarves out of the Wood-elves' prison. When tensions arose over ownership of the treasures beneath the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo uses the Arkenstone, a stolen heirloom jewel, as leverage in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a compromise between the Dwarves, the Wood-elves, and the Men of Lake-town. In so doing, Bilbo strains his relationship with Thorin; however, the two are reconciled at Thorin's deathbed following the Battle of the Five Armies. In addition to becoming wealthy from his share of the Dwarves' treasure, Bilbo finds that he has traded respectability for experience and wisdom.

It is typically an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] institution that caters solely to women, and roughly the equivalent of a [[yeshiva]] for men. An alternative term, and translation, is '[[seminary]]' ({{hebrew|\u05e1\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05e8}}). <ref name=\"science.co.il\">[https://www.science.co.il/jewish-studies/Midrashot.php ''Midrashot''], science.co.il</ref>\nA midrasha that offers [[academic degree|degree studies]] is sometimes called a ''machon'' ({{hebrew|\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df}}, institute).\nThe word \"''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''\" is based on the term ''[[beit midrash]]'', \"house of study\".  It is [[cognate]] with the [[Arabic]] \"''{{transl|ar|[[madrasa|madrasah]]}}'',\" which also refers to a place of learning.\n\"''Midrasha''\" is often associated with Religious Zionist institutions, while \"Seminary\" refers to ''[[Haredi]]'' institutions.\nThe term ''Midrasha'' is sometimes used  more widely, referring to [[Cultural Judaism|pluralistic]], as opposed to [[orthodox Judaism|orthodox]], institutions.\n\n==Structure==\n===Curriculum===\n''{{lang|he-Latn|Midrashot}}'' vary in curriculum and [[Orthodox Judaism#Social and philosophic differences|philosophy]]. \n<ref name=\"Lilith\">[https://www.lilith.org/blog/2014/09/a-modest-year-in-israel-when-young-women-go-to-seminary/ A Modest Year in Israel: When Young Women go to \u201cSeminary\u201d].

The handloom weaving style unique to this region are famously known as Santipuri Sari (tant). After the partition of India, Bengal was split into two major regions.  West Bengal became a part of India and East Bengal became East Pakistan (Bangladesh).  Many skilled weavers from Dhaka, in current day Bangladesh, migrated into West Bengal and settled around the cities of Shantipur and Kalna (Ambika Kalna) of Bardhaman district.  Both are traditionally renowned centers for producing hand-woven fabrics sold throughout the country. Through government support for Indian handicrafts and arts, the weaving community slowly grew and thrived. Saris and finely woven feather-touch textiles are still being produced in the same traditional method today. One can find the patterns and colors found in ancient times still reflected in the garments produced in the vast textile belt of Shantipur, [[Phulia]], [[Samudragarh]], [[Dhatrigram]] and [[Kalna, India|Ambika Kalna]].  Each center produces superb fabrics in its own variation of the Shantipuri style of weaving. Shantipur is especially known for super-fine-weave dhotis and jacquards. These textiles are marketed through co-operatives and various commercial undertakings.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.indiaprofile.com/art-crafts/bengal-art.htm | title = A Traditional Panorama - Bengal Art|accessdate = 2007-09-08 | work = Arts and Crafts in India| publisher =  India Profile}}</ref>\n\nMost of the people in the Sutragarh area of \u200b\u200bShantipur are engaged in textile trade.\u00a0 There is a weaving cloth market's here.\u00a0 This market's is held two days a week on Sunday and Thursday from 4 am to 2 pm. People from nearby villages come to this market's to do business. From here the weaving cloth goes to different parts of the country and is also exported abroad. Weaving sari is also available at Station clothes market, Bara Bazar, various clothing stores in Shantipur and various sari shops in Phulia. \n\nShantipur's handmade saree is famous in the world. \n\n==Religious History==\nThe old and historical town Shantipur is famous for Ras Utsav and [[Holi|\"Dol utsav\"]] which is thought to have begun by Mathuresh Goswami, the great grandson of [[Advaita Acharya]] who was one of the main associates of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]].\n[[File:Ras Leela of Lord Krishna.jpg|alt=Ras Leela of Lord Krishna|thumb|Ras Leela of Lord Krishna|border|right]]\nThe principle deity of the town is 'Radharaman' in the family of Baro Gosai descending from the lineage of Mathuresh Goswami. The deity was originally installed as a single statue of krishna named 'dol govinda' in Orissa by king indradyumna. When the king of [[Jessore District|Yessore]] (now in Bangladesh), [[Maharaja Pratapaditya|Pratapaditya]] attacked Orissa, the priest of the temple gave away the deity to his own guru Mathuresh Goswami to protect it in times of emergency. He brought the idol to his ancestral home in Shantipur where he reinstalled it in a new temple. A deity of [[Radha]] was later installed beside Dolgovinda and both of them renamed Radharaman.\n\n[[File:Rasyatra.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Procession showing Krishna|Rashyatra - celebrations of the loves of Krishna]]\n\nThe deity believed to be worshipped by [[Advaita Acharya]] himself is named Madan Gopal and is worshipped in the lineage of Krishna Mishra, the second son of [[Advaita Acharya]].\n\nOn the day of Rashyatra, the main festival of the town, all of them are taken out in a grand procession around the city accompanied with drums, kirtan and other celebration. Curiously, all the thrones are lit with the age-old Belgium glass candleholders and chandeliers, instead of electric lighting, even to this day. This gives Rashotsav a very ancient and historical look.

The handloom weaving style unique to this region are famously known as Santipuri Sari (tant). After the partition of India, Bengal was split into two major regions.  West Bengal became a part of India and East Bengal became East Pakistan (Bangladesh).  Many skilled weavers from Dhaka, in current day Bangladesh, migrated into West Bengal and settled around the cities of Shantipur and Kalna (Ambika Kalna) of Bardhaman district.  Both are traditionally renowned centers for producing hand-woven fabrics sold throughout the country. Through government support for Indian handicrafts and arts, the weaving community slowly grew and thrived. Saris and finely woven feather-touch textiles are still being produced in the same traditional method today. One can find the patterns and colors found in ancient times still reflected in the garments produced in the vast textile belt of Shantipur, [[Phulia]], [[Samudragarh]], [[Dhatrigram]] and [[Kalna, India|Ambika Kalna]].  Each center produces superb fabrics in its own variation of the Shantipuri style of weaving. Shantipur is especially known for super-fine-weave dhotis and jacquards. These textiles are marketed through co-operatives and various commercial undertakings.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.indiaprofile.com/art-crafts/bengal-art.htm | title = A Traditional Panorama - Bengal Art|accessdate = 2007-09-08 | work = Arts and Crafts in India| publisher =  India Profile}}</ref>\n\nMost of the people in the Sutragarh area of \u200b\u200bShantipur are engaged in textile trade.\u00a0 There is a weaving cloth market's here.\u00a0 This market's is held two days a week on Sunday and Thursday from 4 am to 2 pm. People from nearby villages come to this market's to do business. From here the weaving cloth goes to different parts of the country and is also exported abroad. Weaving sari is also available at Station clothes market, Bara Bazar, various clothing stores in Shantipur and various sari shops in Phulia. \n\n==Religious History==\nThe old and historical town Shantipur is famous for Ras Utsav and [[Holi|\"Dol utsav\"]] which is thought to have begun by Mathuresh Goswami, the great grandson of [[Advaita Acharya]] who was one of the main associates of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]].\n[[File:Ras Leela of Lord Krishna.jpg|alt=Ras Leela of Lord Krishna|thumb|Ras Leela of Lord Krishna|border|right]]\nThe principle deity of the town is 'Radharaman' in the family of Baro Gosai descending from the lineage of Mathuresh Goswami. The deity was originally installed as a single statue of krishna named 'dol govinda' in Orissa by king indradyumna. When the king of [[Jessore District|Yessore]] (now in Bangladesh), [[Maharaja Pratapaditya|Pratapaditya]] attacked Orissa, the priest of the temple gave away the deity to his own guru Mathuresh Goswami to protect it in times of emergency. He brought the idol to his ancestral home in Shantipur where he reinstalled it in a new temple. A deity of [[Radha]] was later installed beside Dolgovinda and both of them renamed Radharaman.\n\n[[File:Rasyatra.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Procession showing Krishna|Rashyatra - celebrations of the loves of Krishna]]\n\nThe deity believed to be worshipped by [[Advaita Acharya]] himself is named Madan Gopal and is worshipped in the lineage of Krishna Mishra, the second son of [[Advaita Acharya]].\n\nOn the day of Rashyatra, the main festival of the town, all of them are taken out in a grand procession around the city accompanied with drums, kirtan and other celebration. Curiously, all the thrones are lit with the age-old Belgium glass candleholders and chandeliers, instead of electric lighting, even to this day. This gives Rashotsav a very ancient and historical look. On this day, as a continuation of a tradition introduced by Bara Goswamis near about 250 years ago, a young girl, called Rai-Raja (Rai is another name for Radha and Raja means king), dressed in expensive attire and gold ornaments is seated in a throne and paraded across the city to be worshipped as Radha.\n\n[[Kali Puja]] is another festival that the people of this place pays a lot of dedication .\n\nThere is a unique form of celebrating Kali worship in the form of hand painted image of the deity known as \"Pateshwari\" meaning drawing of the deity on a piece of cloth. The deity is worshiped for 3 days during the \"[[Rash Utsav]].\" The second day of worship is marked by the sacrifice of a goat.
