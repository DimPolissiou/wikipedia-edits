An example of the need to protect the local autonomy is witnessed in the rise of state intervention in the Amazon, where previously this autonomy had fared well without state presence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=153 }}</ref>  The end result of these movements was the forging and introduction of [[ethnicity|ethnic politics]] into the political debate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=218 }}</ref>  While these did not reshape the entire political process, issues that began to dominate the national discourse included territorial autonomy, [[legal pluralism]], and [[land reform]], among other indigenous concerns.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=218 }}</ref>\n\nThis in turn led to demanding equal positions in the nascent [[democracy]] created in the late twentieth century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=152 }}</ref>  However, there were three developments that impeded the rise of true indigenous autonomy in the political sphere. First of all, the success of \u201cindigenous reforms\u201d depended largely on the political will of the sitting [[Bolivian president]]. Second, political party competition was a significant obstacle, in that the various political parties already entrenched in the system would attempt to ensnare the indigenous movements, which had the effect of weakening the individual interest groups. By participating in electoral politics, the indigenous movement could be torn asunder, where factions and disagreements could be fomented over which party to support.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=218\u2013221 }}</ref>\n\n==Early identification among indigenous groups==\n\nFor most of the nineteenth century, when the question of citizenship began to rise to the fore, there existed in Bolivia two distinct entities, namely those with power and the indigenous groups. The desire of the native groups to be more than simply hard [[laborer]]s began to cause a rift in Bolivian society; as early as 1826, a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] vice-consular secretary noted that there were strong disintegrative forces at work within the republic, related to physical, cultural and regional diversity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=203 }}</ref> There were many reasons for the discontent among the native Bolivians, as well as for the fear among the ruling elite. One example is that the major urban centers were situated in the midst of the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Quechua people|Quechua]] communities, which were two of the more influential indigenous groups.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=204 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, of the more incendiary problems, the territorial issue was the more prominent, as it was an area of contention for many Bolivians. In the early nineteenth century, the indigenous population of Bolivia was divided between a servile [[Leasehold estate|tenantry]] who lived on landed estates and those communal members who inhabited independent communities, called ''[[ayllus]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=204 }}</ref>  According to the first national census in 1846, over half the population lived on these communal landholdings; the significance in this is that [[peasant]] communities still held approximately half the land as well as half the population, whereas the servile tenantry was steadily declining. Seeing as how the indigenous population paid significant tributary [[tax]]es on all revenues, it became advantageous for the Bolivian republic to continue the system of official tributary and territorial identification as a basis of \u201cIndianness,\u201d rather than abolish the arrangement.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=206 }}</ref>  The tributary system had been instituted as a result of economic collapse, Bolivia being an especially weakened and economically depressed country as the independence era drew to a close.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=209 }}</ref>  Furthermore, there existed a serious social stratification among indigenous communities, reinforced by the early republic: at the top were situated those living in ayllus, followed by the servile tenantry, with peasant freeholders situated on the bottom.\n\nWhile all enjoyed a relatively institutionalized relationship with regards to the law and the governing [[bureaucracy]], the main separation lay in the fact that the first two social [[caste]]s held a vested interest in the tributary system, while the landless peasant did not. This led to a rapid decline in tributary populations, as these individuals would evade tax collectors and the official tax rolls. Therefore, to be perceived as Indian, or as truly indigenous, was not simply a legal and administrative tool, but rather a facet of everyday practices.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=207 }}</ref>  In fact, indigenous tribes began to advocate for a \u201chybrid tributary-citizenship status,\u201d which was firmly entrenched with land holdings; in other words, to hold land meant obtaining some variant of official citizenship.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=212 }}</ref>\n\n==Attempting land reform==\n\nEventually, however, this limited ideal for inclusive citizenship coupled with various failed attempts at land reform was insufficient to satisfy the native groups who wished to partake more fully in a growing economy. The government attempted at various moments during the 1860s to introduce Indian land reforms, which were met with stiff opposition. The 1863 decree by President [[Jose Maria de Acha]] dealt with revisiting idealized forms of Indian land tenure. Acha advocated the subdivision of communal plots leading to a participation in a [[free market economy]], where natives would buy and sell households at will, a practice that many believed would increase agricultural production and lead many Indians to becoming prosperous [[yeoman|yeomen]]. However, the government also stipulated that the Indian must \u201ccivilize,\u201d by which it was understood that new households must conform to certain accepted norms, such that they be \u201ccomfortable, spacious and ventilated houses,\u201d or the construction of state approved educational facilities would need to be undertaken.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=215 }}</ref>  The government faced stiff opposition from indigenous groups and the venture was dropped until the land reforms were forced upon the population by subsequent governments in 1866 and 1868. In adopting these land reforms, the government demonstrated its ignorance of Indian culture within its own borders: by hoping that the indigenous peoples would adapt easily and sell off vast tracts of land to the highest bidder, thereby putting wastelands into production and easily increasing state revenues, they failed to consider traditional practices of land rotation. More important to the Indians claims to citizenship, however, was the land reformers\u2019 plan to strengthen the image of the Indian as peasant, whereby any claims to citizenship would be dictated and controlled by the state: socializing them to perform [[manual labor]], to stay in the countryside, in all an attempt to civilize the Indians on the government's terms.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=216, 244 }}</ref>\n\nThis was not accepted quietly. The most active group in pursuing greater participation in acquiring citizenship rights was the Aymara, who would challenge the tributary system by day via official legal means, whereas at night they would embark upon [[guerrilla]] tactics to oppose the changes in land tenure being enforced by the government.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=219 }}</ref>\n\n==1874 Ley de Ex-vinculacion==\n\nThis law saw the culmination of a decade of struggle between the various native groups and the government. It set the basic terms for Indian landholding that would continue up to the mid-twentieth century. While the law conceded the right of individual landownership to Indians, it also abolished the community as a [[juridical]] entity. Rather, this radical law dismantled the tributary system that had existed for decades, replaced instead by a universal [[property tax]]. Unfortunately, Indians lost the modicum of power that they had held as ethnic mediators; henceforth, they would be juridical subjects of civil law, \u201cdirectly subject to the authority of white and mestizo agents and to the siege of the land market.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=220 }}</ref>\n\n==Twentieth century==\nAs [[South America]]n states strengthened up to the mid-twentieth century, so too did the ideals attached to the notion of citizenship and belonging. Throughout, the hardness or flexibility of \u201cethnic hierarchies continued to be influenced through specific local power, socioeconomic, and demographic structures.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=160 }}</ref>  In regions where a dominant white had exercised excessive authority for many decades over a broad majority of subordinated ethnic groups, as in the case of Bolivia, ethnic hierarchies tended to remain more closed. However, the mid-twentieth century saw the emergence of indigenous [[intellectual]]s who desired to design, in the words of Jacobsen and de Losada, a \u201cracial order for the nation capable of overcoming what they saw as the degenerate, corrupt, and chaotic Bolivian republic of the nineteenth century.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages= 164}}</ref>\n\nThe change in attitudes and the desire to obtain an improved version of citizenship for indigenous groups began in the early stages of the twentieth century. At this point in time, Bolivian intellectuals began to distance themselves from racial theories that had long been imported from old Europe, and began to examine their own [[multicultural]] [[Kinship|heritage]]. One of the proposed methods to accomplish this was to propose new reforms that would genuinely benefit the Indian races within Bolivia, in the hopes that the entire state could benefit.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=230 }}</ref>  One theory that emerged was the cultural nationalism of [[Franz Tamayo]]. Although taking a superior stance, he advocated the introduction of \u201ceducator-civilizers,\u201d who would help uplift the indigenous peoples from their lack of citizenship rights; however, the Indian would have to earn his place within the nation-state through \u201cproductive labor, patriotic service, and civic virtues.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=243 }}</ref>  In other words, Tamayo envisioned a social compact between the state and indigenous tribes, wherein citizenship was provided in exchange for the conversion of the Indian into something resembling the ruling classes.\n\nHowever, although the clean-cut version of creating a common citizenship and nationality seemed easy to accomplish, the reality remained that nation building is a complex undertaking. This is especially true when the object of nationalization is located  the margins or even outside the boundaries of national belonging, owing to cultural practices and issues of race, class and gender.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=247 }}</ref>  By the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, it became obvious that the indigenous populations were not becoming consumed by the assimilationist attempt. The problem, as in the nineteenth century, was a question of Indian land ownership. Intensifying [[agrarianism|agrarian]] battles led to a growing amount of [[litigation]] and political campaigning by indigenous authorities, which had the effect of generating a type of official acknowledgement of their status and citizenship within Bolivia.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=248 }}</ref>  In a sense, the native groups used the weapons of the state to fashion a sense of belonging that rendered official their claims to citizenship rights. This led in turn to the growing movement of local and ethnic authorities mounting their own political discourses from below the mainstream political ideologies, from which they began to contest the political discourses and practices currently in place.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=249 }}</ref>  This emerging national network began to demand rights to land, to education, and to full citizenship. However, it would take several decades before any real headway could be made, but the groundwork had been laid.\n\n===Political movements post-1950s===\nFor a brief moment, there seemed to be hope for the indigenous political movement. In 1953, a party known as the ''Movimiento Nacionalist Revolucionaria'' (MNR, [[Nationalist Revolutionary Movement]]) had led a national revolution coupled with an agrarian reform; this in turn was succeeded by over three decades of [[Military dictatorship|military rule]], where a Peasant-Military treaty was signed. The Aymara population collaborated closely with these regimes, in large part by stifling subversive attitudes. Their reward for their loyalty was [[universal suffrage]], as well as the ability to impose their own style of [[local government]] in extensive agricultural areas.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Van Cott |editor2=Donna Lee |title=Indigenous Peoples and Democracy in Latin America |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin\u2019s Press |location=New York |pages=58 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, indigenous tribes still emerged in the 1980s with the desire to eradicate the exploitation and oppression of the Aymara and other indigenous peoples that had not been addressed by any government since the early twentieth century.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Van Cott |editor2=Donna Lee |title=Indigenous Peoples and Democracy in Latin America |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin\u2019s Press |location=New York |pages=55 }}</ref>  By and large, the Aymara were elected by popular acclaim to lead indigenous groups to larger citizenship; the Aymara, for their part, renewed their support for the MNR. By the 1990s, the MNR saw resurgence in popularity, their candidate winning the presidential election in 1993. Upon his victory, he stated that \u201cmarginalization, inequality, and discrimination will be diminished in Bolivia, so as to yield to the building of a multicultural, multiethnic and plurinational country.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Van Cott |editor2=Donna Lee |title=Indigenous Peoples and Democracy in Latin America |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin\u2019s Press |location=New York |pages=56, 58 }}</ref>  The future for indigenous peoples seemed bright indeed. Unfortunately, although the native movement was allied with the winning party, their inherent political weakness prevented them from enjoying full advantage of its access to the government.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Van Cott |editor2=Donna Lee |title=Indigenous Peoples and Democracy in Latin America |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin\u2019s Press |location=New York |pages=74 }}</ref>\n\n==Future==\nWith enthusiasm and expectations concerning their acceptance into full citizenship running so high, there was bound to be disappointment. With the first consecutive elected governments for decades, the first governments in Bolivia were more occupied with facing the challenge of mounting [[debt]]s and weak [[Economy of Bolivia|economies]] than rectify the citizenship status of indigenous peoples, even if these same peoples had lent the party enough clout to ascend to governance.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morales |first=Waltraud Q. |title=A Brief History of Bolivia |year=2003 |publisher=Facts on File Inc. |location=New York |pages=197 }}</ref>  In fact, for most of the nineties, each successive government faced a different national crisis that required full attention. For the most part, although the future is brighter than it was in the nineteenth century, as indigenous peoples now have political voice as well as [[property rights]], native peoples in Bolivia continue to be frustrated and exempt from full citizenship status.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morales |first=Waltraud Q. |title=A Brief History of Bolivia |year=2003 |publisher=Facts on File Inc. |location=New York |pages=225 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Bolivian Nationality}}\n[[Category:History of nationality|Bolivia]]\n[[Category:Bolivian society]]\n", "text_old": "Historically, a major issue for the '''Bolivian nationality''' movement has been [[citizenship]] for [[indigenous people]]s.

The Spanish [[colony]] had shaped sociocultural diversity in its inception by establishing a [[republic|dual-republic]] model: that of the Spaniards, which was dominant, and that of the Indians, \u201cwhich paid the first its tribute and its labor.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Van Cott |editor2=Donna Lee |title=Indigenous Peoples and Democracy in Latin America |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin\u2019s Press |location=New York |pages=57 }}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the establishment of \u201cregimes of social order\u201d created categories of belonging and \u201cotherness\u201d that continue into the modern era.<ref>{{cite book |last=Postero |first=Nancy Grey |title=Now We Are Citizens: Indigenous Politics in Postmulticultural Bolivia |year=2007 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford |pages=25 }}</ref>  According to Deborah Yashar, author of \"Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge\", although indigenous peoples constitute a majority of the population in Bolivia, politicians are prone to use them as tools in the political process, essentially furthering their [[wikt:subjugation|subjugated]] status.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=152 }}</ref>  Conversely, however, the inclusion of native imagery is often utilized to create a sense of [[national identity]], even though the indigenous peoples are excluded from participating in it.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Canessa, Andrew |title=Natives Making Nation: Gender, Indigeneity, and the State in the Andes |year=2005 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson |pages=4, 132 }}</ref>  For example, [[Urban culture|urban]] elites tend to identify with indigenous imagery in order to distinguish themselves as Bolivian, although this serves as a contradiction, as they will vigorously attempt to draw distinctions between themselves and \u2018real\u2019 indigenous peoples.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Canessa, Andrew |title=Natives Making Nation: Gender, Indigeneity, and the State in the Andes |year=2005 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson |pages=7 }}</ref>  In fact, it is \u201cthrough the interplay of racial discrimination and gender hierarchy that the national ideal is constructed and \u2026 that racialized class inequality is reproduced and reinforced.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |editor=Canessa, Andrew |title=Natives Making Nation: Gender, Indigeneity, and the State in the Andes |year=2005 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson |pages=17 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, this course is shifting, as regional movements in both [[Andes|Andean]] and [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]ian Bolivia emerge to defend the local autonomy of separate native groups. An example of the need to protect the local autonomy is witnessed in the rise of state intervention in the Amazon, where previously this autonomy had fared well without state presence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=153 }}</ref>  The end result of these movements was the forging and introduction of [[ethnicity|ethnic politics]] into the political debate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=218 }}</ref>  While these did not reshape the entire political process, issues that began to dominate the national discourse included territorial autonomy, [[legal pluralism]], and [[land reform]], among other indigenous concerns.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=218 }}</ref>\n\nThis in turn led to demanding equal positions in the nascent [[democracy]] created in the late twentieth century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=152 }}</ref>  However, there were three developments that impeded the rise of true indigenous autonomy in the political sphere. First of all, the success of \u201cindigenous reforms\u201d depended largely on the political will of the sitting [[Bolivian president]]. Second, political party competition was a significant obstacle, in that the various political parties already entrenched in the system would attempt to ensnare the indigenous movements, which had the effect of weakening the individual interest groups. By participating in electoral politics, the indigenous movement could be torn asunder, where factions and disagreements could be fomented over which party to support.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yashar |first=Deborah J. |title=Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=218\u2013221 }}</ref>\n\n==Early identification among indigenous groups==\n\nFor most of the nineteenth century, when the question of citizenship began to rise to the fore, there existed in Bolivia two distinct entities, namely those with power and the indigenous groups. The desire of the native groups to be more than simply hard [[laborer]]s began to cause a rift in Bolivian society; as early as 1826, a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] vice-consular secretary noted that there were strong disintegrative forces at work within the republic, related to physical, cultural and regional diversity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=203 }}</ref> There were many reasons for the discontent among the native Bolivians, as well as for the fear among the ruling elite. One example is that the major urban centers were situated in the midst of the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Quechua people|Quechua]] communities, which were two of the more influential indigenous groups.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=204 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, of the more incendiary problems, the territorial issue was the more prominent, as it was an area of contention for many Bolivians. In the early nineteenth century, the indigenous population of Bolivia was divided between a servile [[Leasehold estate|tenantry]] who lived on landed estates and those communal members who inhabited independent communities, called ''[[ayllus]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=204 }}</ref>  According to the first national census in 1846, over half the population lived on these communal landholdings; the significance in this is that [[peasant]] communities still held approximately half the land as well as half the population, whereas the servile tenantry was steadily declining. Seeing as how the indigenous population paid significant tributary [[tax]]es on all revenues, it became advantageous for the Bolivian republic to continue the system of official tributary and territorial identification as a basis of \u201cIndianness,\u201d rather than abolish the arrangement.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=206 }}</ref>  The tributary system had been instituted as a result of economic collapse, Bolivia being an especially weakened and economically depressed country as the independence era drew to a close.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=209 }}</ref>  Furthermore, there existed a serious social stratification among indigenous communities, reinforced by the early republic: at the top were situated those living in ayllus, followed by the servile tenantry, with peasant freeholders situated on the bottom.\n\nWhile all enjoyed a relatively institutionalized relationship with regards to the law and the governing [[bureaucracy]], the main separation lay in the fact that the first two social [[caste]]s held a vested interest in the tributary system, while the landless peasant did not. This led to a rapid decline in tributary populations, as these individuals would evade tax collectors and the official tax rolls. Therefore, to be perceived as Indian, or as truly indigenous, was not simply a legal and administrative tool, but rather a facet of everyday practices.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=207 }}</ref>  In fact, indigenous tribes began to advocate for a \u201chybrid tributary-citizenship status,\u201d which was firmly entrenched with land holdings; in other words, to hold land meant obtaining some variant of official citizenship.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=212 }}</ref>\n\n==Attempting land reform==\n\nEventually, however, this limited ideal for inclusive citizenship coupled with various failed attempts at land reform was insufficient to satisfy the native groups who wished to partake more fully in a growing economy. The government attempted at various moments during the 1860s to introduce Indian land reforms, which were met with stiff opposition. The 1863 decree by President [[Jose Maria de Acha]] dealt with revisiting idealized forms of Indian land tenure. Acha advocated the subdivision of communal plots leading to a participation in a [[free market economy]], where natives would buy and sell households at will, a practice that many believed would increase agricultural production and lead many Indians to becoming prosperous [[yeoman|yeomen]]. However, the government also stipulated that the Indian must \u201ccivilize,\u201d by which it was understood that new households must conform to certain accepted norms, such that they be \u201ccomfortable, spacious and ventilated houses,\u201d or the construction of state approved educational facilities would need to be undertaken.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=215 }}</ref>  The government faced stiff opposition from indigenous groups and the venture was dropped until the land reforms were forced upon the population by subsequent governments in 1866 and 1868. In adopting these land reforms, the government demonstrated its ignorance of Indian culture within its own borders: by hoping that the indigenous peoples would adapt easily and sell off vast tracts of land to the highest bidder, thereby putting wastelands into production and easily increasing state revenues, they failed to consider traditional practices of land rotation. More important to the Indians claims to citizenship, however, was the land reformers\u2019 plan to strengthen the image of the Indian as peasant, whereby any claims to citizenship would be dictated and controlled by the state: socializing them to perform [[manual labor]], to stay in the countryside, in all an attempt to civilize the Indians on the government\u2019s terms.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=216, 244 }}</ref>\n\nThis was not accepted quietly. The most active group in pursuing greater participation in acquiring citizenship rights was the Aymara, who would challenge the tributary system by day via official legal means, whereas at night they would embark upon [[guerrilla]] tactics to oppose the changes in land tenure being enforced by the government.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=219 }}</ref>\n\n==1874 Ley de Ex-vinculacion==\n\nThis law saw the culmination of a decade of struggle between the various native groups and the government. It set the basic terms for Indian landholding that would continue up to the mid-twentieth century. While the law conceded the right of individual landownership to Indians, it also abolished the community as a [[juridical]] entity. Rather, this radical law dismantled the tributary system that had existed for decades, replaced instead by a universal [[property tax]]. Unfortunately, Indians lost the modicum of power that they had held as ethnic mediators; henceforth, they would be juridical subjects of civil law, \u201cdirectly subject to the authority of white and mestizo agents and to the siege of the land market.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Brooke |title=Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race, and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810-1910 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=220 }}</ref>\n\n==Twentieth century==\nAs [[South America]]n states strengthened up to the mid-twentieth century, so too did the ideals attached to the notion of citizenship and belonging. Throughout, the hardness or flexibility of \u201cethnic hierarchies continued to be influenced through specific local power, socioeconomic, and demographic structures.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=160 }}</ref>  In regions where a dominant white had exercised excessive authority for many decades over a broad majority of subordinated ethnic groups, as in the case of Bolivia, ethnic hierarchies tended to remain more closed. However, the mid-twentieth century saw the emergence of indigenous [[intellectual]]s who desired to design, in the words of Jacobsen and de Losada, a \u201cracial order for the nation capable of overcoming what they saw as the degenerate, corrupt, and chaotic Bolivian republic of the nineteenth century.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages= 164}}</ref>\n\nThe change in attitudes and the desire to obtain an improved version of citizenship for indigenous groups began in the early stages of the twentieth century. At this point in time, Bolivian intellectuals began to distance themselves from racial theories that had long been imported from old Europe, and began to examine their own [[multicultural]] [[Kinship|heritage]]. One of the proposed methods to accomplish this was to propose new reforms that would genuinely benefit the Indian races within Bolivia, in the hopes that the entire state could benefit.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=230 }}</ref>  One theory that emerged was the cultural nationalism of [[Franz Tamayo]]. Although taking a superior stance, he advocated the introduction of \u201ceducator-civilizers,\u201d who would help uplift the indigenous peoples from their lack of citizenship rights; however, the Indian would have to earn his place within the nation-state through \u201cproductive labor, patriotic service, and civic virtues.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=243 }}</ref>  In other words, Tamayo envisioned a social compact between the state and indigenous tribes, wherein citizenship was provided in exchange for the conversion of the Indian into something resembling the ruling classes.\n\nHowever, although the clean-cut version of creating a common citizenship and nationality seemed easy to accomplish, the reality remained that nation building is a complex undertaking. This is especially true when the object of nationalization is located  the margins or even outside the boundaries of national belonging, owing to cultural practices and issues of race, class and gender.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=247 }}</ref>  By the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, it became obvious that the indigenous populations were not becoming consumed by the assimilationist attempt. The problem, as in the nineteenth century, was a question of Indian land ownership. Intensifying [[agrarianism|agrarian]] battles led to a growing amount of [[litigation]] and political campaigning by indigenous authorities, which had the effect of generating a type of official acknowledgement of their status and citizenship within Bolivia.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=248 }}</ref>  In a sense, the native groups used the weapons of the state to fashion a sense of belonging that rendered official their claims to citizenship rights. This led in turn to the growing movement of local and ethnic authorities mounting their own political discourses from below the mainstream political ideologies, from which they began to contest the political discourses and practices currently in place.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Jacobsen, Nils |editor2=Cristobal Aljovin de Losada |title=Political Cultures in the Andes 1750-1950 |year=2005 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham|pages=249 }}</ref>  This emerging national network began to demand rights to land, to education, and to full citizenship. However, it would take several decades before any real headway could be made, but the groundwork had been laid.\n\n===Political movements post-1950s===\nFor a brief moment, there seemed to be hope for the indigenous political movement. In 1953, a party known as the ''Movimiento Nacionalist Revolucionaria'' (MNR, [[Nationalist Revolutionary Movement]]) had led a national revolution coupled with an agrarian reform; this in turn was succeeded by over three decades of [[Military dictatorship|military rule]], where a Peasant-Military treaty was signed. The Aymara population collaborated closely with these regimes, in large part by stifling subversive attitudes. Their reward for their loyalty was [[universal suffrage]], as well as the ability to impose their own style of [[local government]] in extensive agricultural areas.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Van Cott |editor2=Donna Lee |title=Indigenous Peoples and Democracy in Latin America |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin\u2019s Press |location=New York |pages=58 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, indigenous tribes still emerged in the 1980s with the desire to eradicate the exploitation and oppression of the Aymara and other indigenous peoples that had not been addressed by any government since the early twentieth century.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Van Cott |editor2=Donna Lee |title=Indigenous Peoples and Democracy in Latin America |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin\u2019s Press |location=New York |pages=55 }}</ref>  By and large, the Aymara were elected by popular acclaim to lead indigenous groups to larger citizenship; the Aymara, for their part, renewed their support for the MNR. By the 1990s, the MNR saw resurgence in popularity, their candidate winning the presidential election in 1993. Upon his victory, he stated that \u201cmarginalization, inequality, and discrimination will be diminished in Bolivia, so as to yield to the building of a multicultural, multiethnic and plurinational country.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Van Cott |editor2=Donna Lee |title=Indigenous Peoples and Democracy in Latin America |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin\u2019s Press |location=New York |pages=56, 58 }}</ref>  The future for indigenous peoples seemed bright indeed. Unfortunately, although the native movement was allied with the winning party, their inherent political weakness prevented them from enjoying full advantage of its access to the government.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Van Cott |editor2=Donna Lee |title=Indigenous Peoples and Democracy in Latin America |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin\u2019s Press |location=New York |pages=74 }}</ref>\n\n==Future==\nWith enthusiasm and expectations concerning their acceptance into full citizenship running so high, there was bound to be disappointment. With the first consecutive elected governments for decades, the first governments in Bolivia were more occupied with facing the challenge of mounting [[debt]]s and weak [[Economy of Bolivia|economies]] than rectify the citizenship status of indigenous peoples, even if these same peoples had lent the party enough clout to ascend to governance.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morales |first=Waltraud Q. |title=A Brief History of Bolivia |year=2003 |publisher=Facts on File Inc. |location=New York |pages=197 }}</ref>  In fact, for most of the nineties, each successive government faced a different national crisis that required full attention. For the most part, although the future is brighter than it was in the nineteenth century, as indigenous peoples now have political voice as well as [[property rights]], native peoples in Bolivia continue to be frustrated and exempt from full citizenship status.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morales |first=Waltraud Q. |title=A Brief History of Bolivia |year=2003 |publisher=Facts on File Inc. |location=New York |pages=225 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Bolivian Nationality}}\n[[Category:History of nationality|Bolivia]]\n[[Category:Bolivian society]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Bolivian_nationality"}
