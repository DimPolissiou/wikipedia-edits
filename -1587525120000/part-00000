But there's also a vulnerability that goes beyond the usual too-beautiful-for-the-world sulking.\" Dolan also said that the album \"hits the best balance yet of the gloomy melodrama of the Weeknd's early EPs or his 2018 release ''[[My Dear Melancholy]]'' and the pop slickness of his 2016 LP ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]''.\"<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\"/> Writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Jem Aswad praised the album, stating that \"The Weeknd is launching the next era with his most fully realized album yet, 'After Hours.' Sonically, the hallmarks are ultra-cinematic keyboards, pulsating sub-bass, hard beats (which are seldom danceable), '80s synthesizer flourishes and caverns of echo, all of which contrast with his high, angelic voice.\" Aswad ended his review by saying that \"''After Hours'' is one of the most successful musicians of the past decade testing the balance between innovation and commerciality as much as anyone today.\"<ref name=\"Aswad\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/music/reviews/the-weeknd-after-hours-album-review-1203539981/|title=The Weeknd's 'After Hours': Album Review|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Aswad|first=Jem|date=March 20, 2020|accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> David Smyth of ''[[Evening Standard]]'' particularly praised the song \"Blinding Lights\", while stating that The Weeknd's \"in a bit of a fug\" on the rest of the album.<ref name=\"ES\" />\n\n==Commercial performance==\nDespite the album not being released yet during the tracking period ending on February 27, 2020, ''After Hours'' managed to reach a position of number 10 on the US [[Rolling Stone Top 200|''Rolling Stone'' Top 200]] through the 36,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s provided by the already available singles at the time.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone Top 200 (February 21, 2020 - February 27, 2020)\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/charts/albums/2020-02-27/|title=Top 200 Albums|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}</ref> On March 19, 2020, ''After Hours'' broke the record for the most global pre-adds for an album in Apple Music history, with over 1.02&nbsp;million users pre-adding the album to their libraries.<ref name=\"MBW\"/> \n\n''After Hours'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 444,000 album-equivalent units, including 275,000 pure album sales.

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

I grew up poor and in those days calling someone 'country' was a put-down,\" she said in 2003.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} In high school, Seely was a [[cheerleading|cheerleader]] and an [[honors student]].

Horton noted that Seely's signature tune, \"Don't Touch\", was controversial due to its lyric. \"'Don't Touch Me' caused quite a stir upon its release as one of the first country songs featuring a woman expressing sexual desire. Proving that women can sing about sex too...\"<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Horton also explained that her material could be considered classic country. Songs such as \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" and \"A Wanderin' Man\" fused \"honky tonk\" and \"traditional country\" with modern arrangements, according to Horton.<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Seely has frequently been nicknamed \"Miss Country Soul\" for her stylistic choices related to the blue-eyed soul genre. In a 2017 interview, Seely explained how she acquired the nickname. \"...as I left the radio station he\u2019d visited, the disc jockey played my record 'Don\u2019t Touch Me' and he back-announced it saying \u2018that\u2019s the blue-eyed soul of Miss Country Soul Jeannie Seely\u2019 and Ed really liked the sound and the feel of that and it so it kinda stuck,\" she commented.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive Interview with Country Legend Jeannie Seely |url=https://www.grizzlyrose.com/interview-jeannie-seely/ |website=Grizzly Rose |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSeely has been influenced mostly by artists in the country music genre.

Some writers have noted the emotion in her vocal delivery. [[Ken Burns]] of [[PBS]] called Seely's voice \"emotion packed\" in his biography of her music and career.<ref name=\"PBS\"/> John Lupton of ''Country Standard Time'' called her voice \"distinctive and raspy\".<ref name=\"Country Standard Time\"/> Mary Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann considered Seely to be an example of the \"heartache/victim singers\" of the 1960s and 1970s. Bufwack and Oermann compared her voice to that of [[Connie Smith]], Dottie West and [[Tammy Wynette]]. \"Jeannie's husky cigarette-stained voice moaned with such agony that she was dubbed 'Miss Country Soul'\", they wrote.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} Other journalists had differed opinions. Greg Adams of Allmusic considered her voice to resemble that of a \"pop-oriented\" singer rather than country.

In his office, she convinced Devine to wear a miniskirt regularly. \"Okay, this is what America is wearing and I\u2019ll make you a deal.

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

I grew up poor and in those days calling someone 'country' was a put-down,\" she said in 2003.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} In high school, Seely was a [[cheerleading|cheerleader]] and an [[honors student]].

Proving that women can sing about sex too...\"<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Horton also explained that her material could be considered classic country. Songs such as \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" and \"A Wanderin' Man\" fused \"honky tonk\" and \"traditional country\" with modern arrangements, according to Horton.<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Seely has frequently been nicknamed \"Miss Country Soul\" for her stylistic choices related to the blue-eyed soul genre.

It is their last album of the 1970s to feature original drummer [[Bill Bruford]] before he left to join [[King Crimson]]. After touring their previous album, ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'', the group assembled at [[Advision Studios]] in London to record a follow-up, ideas for which had been put down since February 1972. The album marked a development in the band's songwriting, with [[Jon Anderson]] and [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]] writing the 18-minute [[Close to the Edge (song)|title track]], the band's longest song at the time. Side two contains \"[[And You and I]]\" and \"[[Siberian Khatru]]\". Bruford found the album particularly laborious to make, which influenced his decision to leave the band after it was recorded.\n\n''Close to the Edge'' became the band's greatest commercial success, peaking at No. 3 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the United States and No. 4 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. A two-part edit of \"And You and I\" was released in the US which reached No. 42 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. Yes supported the album with their [[Close to the Edge Tour|1972\u20131973 world tour]] which comprised over 90 dates and marked the debut of drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]]. ''Close to the Edge'' was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 1998 for selling one million copies. It was reissued in 1994, 2003, and 2013; the latter included previously unreleased tracks and new stereo and [[5.1 surround sound]] mixes by [[Steven Wilson]]. Critical reception was mixed at the time of the original release, though the album is retrospectively regarded as one of the band's best works and a landmark recording in progressive rock.\n\n== Background and writing ==\nBy 1972, Yes was established with a line-up of lead vocalist [[Jon Anderson]], bassist [[Chris Squire]], drummer [[Bill Bruford]], guitarist [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]], and keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]].<ref name=LPsleeve>{{cite AV media notes|title=Close to the Edge|year=1972|publisher=Atlantic Records|type=LP liner notes|id=K 50012}}</ref> In March 1972, they wrapped their six-month [[Fragile Tour|1971\u201372 tour]] of the UK and North America to support their previous album, ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'' (1971). On 1 and 2 February 1972, during one of the tour's rest periods, the band booked time at [[Advision Studios]] in London to put down some tracks for a follow-up record.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=120}} The tour over, they took another break before they entered rehearsals at the Una Billings School of Dance in [[Shepherd's Bush]] in May.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=122}} Although some arrangements were worked out and put onto tape during this time,{{sfn|Bruford|2009|p=56}} none of the tracks were fully written at this stage, leaving the group to devise the rest of the songs in the studio and learn to play them through afterwards.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=122}} On several occasions the arrangements that Yes had started to assemble were so complex that they were forgotten by the time the next day's session began. This caused the band to record each rehearsal for future reference.{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=35}} Bruford devised the album's title to reflect the state of the band at the time.{{sfn|Bruford|2009|p=57}}\n\n== Recording ==\nBy June 1972, Yes had worked out songs for the album and returned to Advision to record it.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=123}} [[Eddy Offord]], who had worked with Yes since ''[[Time and a Word]]'' (1970) and had mixed their live sound on the ''Fragile'' tour, assumed his role as audio engineer and producer, sharing his production duties with each member of the band.<ref name=LPsleeve/> Having worked on the band's sound on tour, Offord wished to recreate, in the studio, the high feeling the band had on nights when they performed well in concert. To attempt this, he got their road crew to construct a large stage in the recording studio for the band to perform on; he noted that Bruford's drums resonated with the wooden platform and made the band sound \"more live\".{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=35}} The studio also housed a booth-like structure constructed of wooden boards which Howe performed in to further enhance his sound.{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=39}} During the recording, the band decided to use a particular take for a track, but realised the studio's cleaner had put the tape in the rubbish. A scramble in the bins outside the studio ensued, and the missing piece was found and inserted into the master.{{sfn|Bruford|2009|p=57}}\n\n[[File:Bill Bruford in Groznjan 2009 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Drummer [[Bill Bruford]] left the band after the album was recorded.]]\nDuring their month of recording, ''[[Melody Maker]]'' reporter and band biographer [[Chris Welch]] visited the studio to observe the recording progress. Welch described a stressful atmosphere, coupled with \"outbursts of anarchy\" from Bruford, Howe and Wakeman and disagreement from each member after one mix of a song section was complete.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=123}} Welch sensed the band were not a cohesive unit, with Anderson and Howe the only ones who knew what direction the album was to take, leaving the rest adding bits and pieces \"to a vast jigsaw of sound\", to which Squire and Offord were the two who helped put their idea into shape. Wakeman and Bruford, to Welch, remained \"innocent bystanders\" in the matter.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=123}} In one instance, Welch arrived at the studio to hear a preview of a completed passage that took several days of round-the-clock work to produce. He heard a dull thud, to find Offord had fallen asleep on top of the mixing console from exhaustion, \"leaving music from the spinning tape deck blaring at an intolerable level\".{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=124}}\n\nBruford found ''Close to the Edge'' particularly difficult to write and record with the rest of the band, calling the process torturous and like \"climbing [[Mount Everest]]\".{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=35}} He became frustrated with the band's happy, [[diatonic]] music and favoured more jazz-oriented and improvisational compositions.{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=34}}{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=40}} This became an issue with the group's way of composing and recording, as each section of a track was played through and discussed section by section. Bruford said: \"Every instrument was up for democratic election, and everybody had to run an election campaign on every issue. It was horrible, it was incredibly unpleasant, and unbelievably hard work\".{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=34}} Squire became a growing source of discontent for Bruford, citing his frequent lateness for rehearsals and his way of working. In one instance, Bruford fell asleep on a sofa in the studio control room while Squire was \"poring over a couple of knobs on the [mixing] desk\" to determine how much [[Equalization (audio)|equalisation]] should be applied to his bass tracks, only to wake up several hours later, finding Squire \"in the same place, still considering the relative position of the two knobs\".{{sfn|Bruford|2009|p=57}}{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=37}} Bruford was constantly encouraged by Anderson to write, something he felt grateful for years later,{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=121}} but by the time recording was complete, he felt he had done his best on ''Close to the Edge'' and could not offer better arrangements. \"So then I knew I needed a breath of fresh air\", and left the group.{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=40}}\n\n== Songs ==\n=== Side one ===\n\"[[Close to the Edge (song)|Close to the Edge]]\" was written by Anderson and Howe, both of whom also share lyrical credits. Its 18-minute length marked the longest track Yes had recorded at the time. Anderson gained initial inspiration from a moment in his hotel room during the Fragile Tour when he was reading ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] while listening to [[Symphony No. 6 (Sibelius)|Symphony Nos. 6]] and [[Symphony No. 7 (Sibelius)|7]] by [[Jean Sibelius]], one of his favourite composers. The seventh struck Anderson the most as he noticed that its main theme was introduced some time in the composition which influenced how \"Close to the Edge\" was shaped. He studied No. 7 for the remainder of the tour; roughly halfway, he discussed his initial ideas with Howe. During a break the two resumed writing at Howe's home in [[Hampstead]], at which point Howe devised lyric \"Close to the edge, round by the corner\",<ref name=BCB19>{{cite web|url=https://bestclassicbands.com/jon-anderson-interview-3-26-19/|title=Jon Anderson Interview?

''[[New Musical Express]]'' printed a more mixed review from [[Ian MacDonald]] on 2 September 1972. He thought the group were \"not just close to the edge, they've gone right over it\", though they \"played their God-damned guts out\" on the album which he called \"an attempt to overwhelm us which resulted in only unmemorable meaninglessness\". MacDonald concluded: \"On every level but the ordinary aesthetic one, it's one of the most remarkable records pop has yet produced\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Meaningless magnificence from Yes?|first=Ian|last=MacDonald|date=2 September 1972|magazine=New Musical Express|page=15|via=ProQuest}}</ref> Henry Medoza opened his review for ''[[The San Bernardino Sun]]'' with: \"Not since ... ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' has there been one side on an album that expressed such a complete and exciting a musical thought as side one\", and thought it presented the group with a new level of sophistication. He praised the group's vocal harmonies and Bruford's \"deep irregular bass drum\" on the opening of the title track, but picked its third section as the most interesting with the trading vocals, Wakeman's \"dream-like\" and \"powerful\" organ playing. Mendoza described side two as more \"uninspiring\" than the first, but praised the vocals and harmonies on both tracks, noting they sound like its own instrument on \"Siberian Khatru\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6602077/yes_close_to_the_edge/|first=Henry|last=Mendoza|title=Soundings - Close to the Edge|newspaper=The San Bernardino Sun|date=28 September 1972|page=47|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=September 15, 2016}}{{free access}}</ref> The ''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]'' printed another positive review by Jon Clemens. He called the title track a \"virtual sound trip\", moving \"quickly, loudly, in a frenzy\" that \"contrasts brilliantly\" during \"I Get Up, I Get Down\", and praises the vocals during the section.

It is their last album of the 1970s to feature original drummer [[Bill Bruford]] before he left to join [[King Crimson]]. After touring their previous album, ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'', the group assembled at [[Advision Studios]] in London to record a follow-up, ideas for which had been put down since February 1972. The album marked a development in the band's songwriting, with [[Jon Anderson]] and [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]] writing the 18-minute [[Close to the Edge (song)|title track]], the band's longest song at the time. Side two contains \"[[And You and I]]\" and \"[[Siberian Khatru]]\". Bruford found the album particularly laborious to make, which influenced his decision to leave the band after it was recorded.\n\n''Close to the Edge'' became the band's greatest commercial success, peaking at No. 3 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the United States and No. 4 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. A two-part edit of \"And You and I\" was released in the US which reached No. 42 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. Yes supported the album with their [[Close to the Edge Tour|1972\u20131973 world tour]] which comprised over 90 dates and marked the debut of drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]]. ''Close to the Edge'' was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 1998 for selling one million copies. It was reissued in 1994, 2003, and 2013; the latter included previously unreleased tracks and new stereo and [[5.1 surround sound]] mixes by [[Steven Wilson]]. Critical reception was mixed at the time of the original release, though the album is retrospectively regarded as one of the band's best works and a landmark recording in progressive rock.\n\n== Background and writing ==\nBy 1972, Yes was established with a line-up of lead vocalist [[Jon Anderson]], bassist [[Chris Squire]], drummer [[Bill Bruford]], guitarist [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]], and keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]].<ref name=LPsleeve>{{cite AV media notes|title=Close to the Edge|year=1972|publisher=Atlantic Records|type=LP liner notes|id=K 50012}}</ref> In March 1972, they wrapped their six-month [[Fragile Tour|1971\u201372 tour]] of the UK and North America to support their previous album, ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'' (1971). On 1 and 2 February 1972, during one of the tour's rest periods, the band booked time at [[Advision Studios]] in London to put down some tracks for a follow-up record.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=120}} The tour over, they took another break before they entered rehearsals at the Una Billings School of Dance in [[Shepherd's Bush]] in May.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=122}} Although some arrangements were worked out and put onto tape during this time,{{sfn|Bruford|2009|p=56}} none of the tracks were fully written at this stage, leaving the group to devise the rest of the songs in the studio and learn to play them through afterwards.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=122}} On several occasions the arrangements that Yes had started to assemble were so complex that they were forgotten by the time the next day's session began. This caused the band to record each rehearsal for future reference.{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=35}} Bruford devised the album's title to reflect the state of the band at the time.{{sfn|Bruford|2009|p=57}}\n\n== Recording ==\nBy June 1972, Yes had worked out songs for the album and returned to Advision to record it.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=123}} [[Eddy Offord]], who had worked with Yes since ''[[Time and a Word]]'' (1970) and had mixed their live sound on the ''Fragile'' tour, assumed his role as audio engineer and producer, sharing his production duties with each member of the band.<ref name=LPsleeve/> Having worked on the band's sound on tour, Offord wished to recreate, in the studio, the high feeling the band had on nights when they performed well in concert. To attempt this, he got their road crew to construct a large stage in the recording studio for the band to perform on; he noted that Bruford's drums resonated with the wooden platform and made the band sound \"more live\".{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=35}} The studio also housed a booth-like structure constructed of wooden boards which Howe performed in to further enhance his sound.{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=39}} During the recording, the band decided to use a particular take for a track, but realised the studio's cleaner had put the tape in the rubbish. A scramble in the bins outside the studio ensued, and the missing piece was found and inserted into the master.{{sfn|Bruford|2009|p=57}}\n\n[[File:Bill Bruford in Groznjan 2009 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Drummer [[Bill Bruford]] left the band after the album was recorded.]]\nDuring their month of recording, ''[[Melody Maker]]'' reporter and band biographer [[Chris Welch]] visited the studio to observe the recording progress. Welch described a stressful atmosphere, coupled with \"outbursts of anarchy\" from Bruford, Howe and Wakeman and disagreement from each member after one mix of a song section was complete.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=123}} Welch sensed the band were not a cohesive unit, with Anderson and Howe the only ones who knew what direction the album was to take, leaving the rest adding bits and pieces \"to a vast jigsaw of sound\", to which Squire and Offord were the two who helped put their idea into shape. Wakeman and Bruford, to Welch, remained \"innocent bystanders\" in the matter.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=123}} In one instance, Welch arrived at the studio to hear a preview of a completed passage that took several days of round-the-clock work to produce. He heard a dull thud, to find Offord had fallen asleep on top of the mixing console from exhaustion, \"leaving music from the spinning tape deck blaring at an intolerable level\".{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=124}}\n\nBruford found ''Close to the Edge'' particularly difficult to write and record with the rest of the band, calling the process torturous and like \"climbing [[Mount Everest]]\".{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=35}} He became frustrated with the band's happy, [[diatonic]] music and favoured more jazz-oriented and improvisational compositions.{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=34}}{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=40}} This became an issue with the group's way of composing and recording, as each section of a track was played through and discussed section by section. Bruford said: \"Every instrument was up for democratic election, and everybody had to run an election campaign on every issue. It was horrible, it was incredibly unpleasant, and unbelievably hard work\".{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=34}} Squire became a growing source of discontent for Bruford, citing his frequent lateness for rehearsals and his way of working. In one instance, Bruford fell asleep on a sofa in the studio control room while Squire was \"poring over a couple of knobs on the [mixing] desk\" to determine how much [[Equalization (audio)|equalisation]] should be applied to his bass tracks, only to wake up several hours later, finding Squire \"in the same place, still considering the relative position of the two knobs\".{{sfn|Bruford|2009|p=57}}{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=37}} Bruford was constantly encouraged by Anderson to write, something he felt grateful for years later,{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=121}} but by the time recording was complete, he felt he had done his best on ''Close to the Edge'' and could not offer better arrangements. \"So then I knew I needed a breath of fresh air\", and left the group.{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=40}}\n\n== Songs ==\n=== Side one ===\n\"[[Close to the Edge (song)|Close to the Edge]]\" was written by Anderson and Howe, both of whom also share lyrical credits. Its 18-minute length marked the longest track Yes had recorded at the time. Anderson gained initial inspiration from a moment in his hotel room during the Fragile Tour when he was reading ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] while listening to [[Symphony No. 6 (Sibelius)|Symphony Nos. 6]] and [[Symphony No. 7 (Sibelius)|7]] by [[Jean Sibelius]], one of his favourite composers. The seventh struck Anderson the most as he noticed that its main theme was introduced some time in the composition which influenced how \"Close to the Edge\" was shaped. He studied No. 7 for the remainder of the tour; roughly halfway, he discussed his initial ideas with Howe. During a break the two resumed writing at Howe's home in [[Hampstead]], at which point Howe devised lyric \"Close to the edge, round by the corner\",<ref name=BCB19>{{cite web|url=https://bestclassicbands.com/jon-anderson-interview-3-26-19/|title=Jon Anderson Interview?

''[[New Musical Express]]'' printed a more mixed review from [[Ian MacDonald]] on 2 September 1972. He thought the group were \"not just close to the edge, they've gone right over it\", though they \"played their God-damned guts out\" on the album which he called \"an attempt to overwhelm us which resulted in only unmemorable meaninglessness\". MacDonald concluded: \"On every level but the ordinary aesthetic one, it's one of the most remarkable records pop has yet produced\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Meaningless magnificence from Yes?|first=Ian|last=MacDonald|date=2 September 1972|magazine=New Musical Express|page=15|via=ProQuest}}</ref> Henry Medoza opened his review for ''[[The San Bernardino Sun]]'' with: \"Not since ... ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' has there been one side on an album that expressed such a complete and exciting a musical thought as side one\", and thought it presented the group with a new level of sophistication. He praised the group's vocal harmonies and Bruford's \"deep irregular bass drum\" on the opening of the title track, but picked its third section as the most interesting with the trading vocals, Wakeman's \"dream-like\" and \"powerful\" organ playing. Mendoza described side two as more \"uninspiring\" than the first, but praised the vocals and harmonies on both tracks, noting they sound like its own instrument on \"Siberian Khatru\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6602077/yes_close_to_the_edge/|first=Henry|last=Mendoza|title=Soundings - Close to the Edge|newspaper=The San Bernardino Sun|date=28 September 1972|page=47|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=September 15, 2016}}{{free access}}</ref> The ''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]'' printed another positive review by Jon Clemens. He called the title track a \"virtual sound trip\", moving \"quickly, loudly, in a frenzy\" that \"contrasts brilliantly\" during \"I Get Up, I Get Down\", and praises the vocals during the section. Clemens thought highly of Howe and Wakeman's interplay throughout, but thought the group's tendency to frequently change tempo risks to distract the listener to the music.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6602046/yes_close_to_the_edge/|first=John|last=Clemens|title=British Group 'Yes' Close to Sounds of Future Rock|newspaper=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|date=2 November 1972|page=57|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=September 15, 2016}}{{free access}}</ref> For the ''[[San Mateo County Times|San Mateo Times]]'', Peter J.
