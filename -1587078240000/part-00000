An Age of Plague 1300\u20131400 }}</ref> It was during these years that Chaucer began working on his most famous text, ''The Canterbury Tales''. The tales (mostly written in [[verse (poetry)|verse]], although some are in [[prose]]) are presented as part of a story-telling contest by a group of [[pilgrim]]s as they travel together from London to [[Canterbury]] to visit the shrine of Saint [[Thomas Becket]] at [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. The prize for this contest is a free meal at the [[The Tabard|Tabard Inn]] at Southwark on their return.\n\nAfter a long list of works written earlier in his career, including ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', ''[[House of Fame]]'', and ''[[Parlement of Foules|Parliament of Fowls]]'', ''The Canterbury Tales'' is near-unanimously seen as Chaucer's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. He uses the tales and descriptions of its characters to paint an ironic and critical portrait of English society at the time, and particularly of the Church. Chaucer's use of such a wide range of classes and types of people was without precedent in English. Although the characters are fictional, they still offer a variety of insights into customs and practices of the time. Often, such insight leads to a variety of discussions and disagreements among people in the 14th century. For example, although various social classes are represented in these stories and all of the pilgrims are on a spiritual quest, it is apparent that they are more concerned with worldly things than spiritual. Structurally, the collection resembles [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio's]] ''[[Decameron]]'', which Chaucer may have read during his first diplomatic mission to [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] in 1372.\n\nIt has been suggested that the greatest contribution of ''The Canterbury Tales'' to [[English literature]] was the popularisation of the English [[vernacular]] in mainstream literature, as opposed to French, Italian or [[Latin]]. English had, however, been used as a literary language centuries before Chaucer's time, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries\u2014[[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], [[the Pearl Poet]], and [[Julian of Norwich]]\u2014also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was seminal in this evolution of literary preference.\n\nWhile Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems, the intended audience of ''The Canterbury Tales'' is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a [[courtier]], leading some to believe that he was mainly a court poet who wrote exclusively for nobility.\n\n''The Canterbury Tales'' is generally thought to have been incomplete at the end of Chaucer's life. In the [[General Prologue]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = Geoffrey Chaucer (1342\u20131400) \"The Canterbury Tales\" (in middle english and modern english)|url = http://www.librarius.com/cantales.htm|website = www.librarius.com|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}</ref> some 30 pilgrims are introduced. According to the Prologue, Chaucer's intention was to write four stories from the perspective of each pilgrim, two each on the way to and from their ultimate destination, St. Thomas Becket's shrine (making for a total of about 120 stories). Although perhaps incomplete, ''The Canterbury Tales'' is revered as one of the most important works in English literature. It is also open to a wide range of interpretations.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature|last = Black|first = Joseph|publisher = Broadview Press|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Canada|pages = 229\u2013331}}</ref>\n\n==Text==\nThe question of whether ''The Canterbury Tales'' is a finished work has not been answered to date. There are 84 manuscripts and four [[incunabula]] (printed before 1500) editions<ref>[[https://www.mossercatalogue.net/ A Digital Catalogue of the Pre-1500 Manuscripts and Incunables of the Canterbury Tales Second Edition]]</ref> of the work, dating from the late medieval and early Renaissance periods, more than for any other vernacular literary text with the exception of ''[[The Prick of Conscience]]''. This is taken as evidence of the ''Tales''' popularity during the century after Chaucer's death.<ref name=\"Pearsall, 8\">Pearsall, 8.</ref> Fifty-five of these manuscripts are thought to have been originally complete, while 28 are so fragmentary that it is difficult to ascertain whether they were copied individually or as part of a set.<ref>Cooper, 6\u20137</ref> The ''Tales'' vary in both minor and major ways from manuscript to manuscript; many of the minor variations are due to copyists' errors, while it is suggested that in other cases Chaucer both added to his work and revised it as it was being copied and possibly as it was being distributed. Determining the text of the work is complicated by the question of the narrator's voice which Chaucer made part of his literary structure.\n\nEven the oldest surviving manuscripts of the ''Tales'' are not Chaucer's originals. The very oldest is probably MS Peniarth 392 D (called \"[[Hengwrt Chaucer|Hengwrt]]\"), written by a scribe shortly after Chaucer's death. Another famous example is the [[Ellesmere Chaucer|Ellesmere Manuscript]], a manuscript handwritten by one person with illustrations by several illustrators; the tales are put in an order that many later editors have followed for centuries.<ref>Pearsall, 10, 17.</ref><ref>Cooper, 8.</ref> The first version of ''The Canterbury Tales'' to be published in print was [[William Caxton]]'s 1476 edition. Only 10 copies of this edition are known to exist, including one held by the [[British Library]] and one held by the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]].\n\nIn 2004, Linne Mooney claimed that she was able to identify the [[scrivener]] who worked for Chaucer as an [[Adam Pinkhurst]]. Mooney, then a professor at the [[University of Maine]] and a visiting fellow at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], said she could match Pinkhurst's signature, on an oath he signed, to his handwriting on a copy of ''The Canterbury Tales'' that might have been transcribed from Chaucer's working copy.<ref>Linne R. Mooney (2006), \"Chaucer's Scribe,\" ''Speculum'', '''81''' : 97\u2013138.</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jul/20/highereducation.books] Ezard, John (20 July 2004). \"The scrivener's tale: how Chaucer's sloppy copyist was unmasked after 600 years\". ''The Guardian''.</ref> Recent scholarship has cast severe doubt upon that identification.<ref>See overview in the Wiki 'Adam Pinkhurst' page, citing especially Lawrence Warner, ''Chaucer's Scribes: London Textual Production, 1384\u20131432'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018).</ref>\n\n===Order===\n{{Main|Order of The Canterbury Tales|List of The Canterbury Tales characters}}\nIn the absence of consensus as to whether or not a complete version of the ''Tales'' exists, there is also no general agreement regarding the order in which Chaucer intended the stories to be placed.<ref name = seven>Cooper, 7</ref><ref>Pearsall, 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nTextual and manuscript clues have been adduced to support the two most popular modern methods of ordering the tales. Some scholarly editions divide the ''Tales'' into ten \"Fragments\". The tales that make up a Fragment are closely related and contain internal indications of their order of presentation, usually with one character speaking to and then stepping aside for another character. However, between Fragments, the connection is less obvious. Consequently, there are several possible orders; the one most frequently seen in modern editions follows the numbering of the Fragments (ultimately based on the Ellesmere order).<ref name = seven/> Victorians frequently used the nine \"Groups\", which was the order used by [[Walter William Skeat]] whose edition ''Chaucer: Complete Works'' was used by Oxford University Press for most of the twentieth century, but this order is now{{when|date=March 2018}} seldom followed.<ref name = seven/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:50%\"\n!  width=\"15%\" | Fragment\n!  width=\"5%\"  | Group\n!  width=\"30%\" class=\"unsortable\" | Tales\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">01</span>Fragment I || A\n|\n* [[General Prologue]],\n* [[The Knight's Tale]],\n* [[The Miller's Tale]],\n* [[The Reeve's Tale]],\n* [[The Cook's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">02</span>Fragment II || B<sup>1</sup>\n|\n* [[The Man of Law's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">03</span>Fragment III || D\n|\n* [[The Wife of Bath's Tale]],\n* [[The Friar's Tale]],\n* [[The Summoner's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">04</span>Fragment IV || E\n|\n* [[The Clerk's Tale]],\n* [[The Merchant's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">05</span>Fragment V || F\n|\n* [[The Squire's Tale]],\n* [[The Franklin's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">06</span>Fragment VI || C\n|\n* [[The Physician's Tale]],\n* [[The Pardoner's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">07</span>Fragment VII || B<sup>2</sup>\n|\n* [[The Shipman's Tale]],\n* [[The Prioress's Tale]],\n* [[Sir Thopas]]' Tale,\n* [[The Tale of Melibee]],\n* [[The Monk's Tale]],\n* [[The Nun's Priest's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">08</span>Fragment VIII || G\n|\n* [[The Second Nun's Tale]],\n* [[The Canon's Yeoman's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">09</span>Fragment IX || H\n|\n* [[The Manciple's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">10</span>Fragment X || I\n|\n* [[The Parson's Tale]]\n|}\n\nAn alternative ordering (seen in an early manuscript containing ''The Canterbury Tales'', the early-fifteenth century [[Harley MS. 7334]]) places Fragment VIII before VI.

From philological research, some facts are known about the pronunciation of English during the time of Chaucer. Chaucer pronounced ''-e'' at the end of many words, so that ''care'' was {{IPA-enm|\u02c8ka\u02d0r\u0259|}}, not {{IPAc-en|k|\u025b\u0259r}} as in Modern English. Other silent letters were also pronounced, so that the word ''knight'' was {{IPA|[kni\u00e7t]}}, with both the ''k'' and the ''gh'' pronounced, not {{IPAc-en|n|a\u026a|t}}. In some cases, vowel letters in Middle English were pronounced very differently from Modern English, because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] had not yet happened. For instance, the long ''e'' in ''wepyng'' \"weeping\" was pronounced as {{IPA-enm|e\u02d0|}}, as in modern German or Italian, not as {{IPAc-en|i\u02d0}}.

It is obvious, however, that Chaucer borrowed portions, sometimes very large portions, of his stories from earlier stories, and that his work was influenced by the general state of the literary world in which he lived. Storytelling was the main entertainment in England at the time, and storytelling contests had been around for hundreds of years. In 14th-century England the English [[Pui (society)|Pui]] was a group with an appointed leader who would judge the songs of the group. The winner received a crown and, as with the winner of ''The Canterbury Tales'', a free dinner. It was common for pilgrims on a pilgrimage to have a chosen \"master of ceremonies\" to guide them and organise the journey.<ref>Cooper, p. 10.</ref> [[Harold Bloom]] suggests that the structure is mostly original, but inspired by the \"pilgrim\" figures of Dante and Virgil in ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]''.<ref name=\"Harold Bloom\">{{cite news|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Road Trip|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/review/Bloom-t.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 September 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 November 2009}}</ref> New research suggests that the General Prologue, in which the innkeeper and host Harry Bailey introduces each pilgrim, is a pastiche of the historical Harry Bailey's surviving 1381 poll-tax account of Southwark's inhabitants.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sobecki|first1=Sebastian|title=A Southwark Tale: Gower, the 1381 Poll Tax, and Chaucer's ''The Canterbury Tales''|journal=Speculum|date=2017|volume=92|issue=3|pages=630\u201360|doi=10.1086/692620|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/44079043/692620.pdf}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Decameron]]'' by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] contains more parallels to ''The Canterbury Tales'' than any other work. Like the ''Tales'', it features a number of narrators who tell stories along a journey they have undertaken (to flee from the [[Black Death]]). It ends with an apology by Boccaccio, much like [[Chaucer's Retraction]] to the ''Tales''. A quarter of the tales in ''The Canterbury Tales'' parallel a tale in the ''Decameron'', although most of them have closer parallels in other stories. Some scholars thus find it unlikely that Chaucer had a copy of the work on hand, surmising instead that he may have merely read the ''Decameron'' at some point.<ref>Cooper, pp. 10\u201311.</ref> Each of the tales has its own set of sources that have been suggested by scholars, but a few sources are used frequently over several tales. They include poetry by [[Ovid]], the Bible in one of the many vulgate versions in which it was available at the time (the exact one is difficult to determine), and the works of [[Petrarch]] and [[Dante]]. Chaucer was the first author to use the work of these last two, both Italians. [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' appears in several tales, as the works of [[John Gower]] do. Gower was a known friend to Chaucer. Chaucer also seems to have borrowed from numerous religious encyclopaedias and liturgical writings, such as [[John Bromyard]]'s ''[[Summa praedicantium]]'', a preacher's handbook, and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Against Jovinianus|Adversus Jovinianum]]''.<ref>Cooper, pp. 12\u201316.</ref> Many scholars say there is a good possibility [[Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio|Chaucer met Petrarch or Boccaccio]].<ref name=\"Brewer227\">Brewer, p. 227. \"Although Chaucer undoubtedly studied the works of these celebrated writers, and particularly of Dante before this fortunate interview; yet it seems likely, that these excursions gave him a new relish for their compositions, and enlarged his knowledge of the Italian fables.''</ref><ref name=\"Brewer277\">Brewer, p. 277.\"...where he became thoroughly inbued with the spirit and excellence of the great Italian poets and prose-writers: Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio; and is said to have had a personal contact interview with one of these, Petrarch.\"</ref><ref name=\"Hendrickson183-192\">Hendrickson, pp. 183\u201392. Professor G. L. Hendrickson of the University of Chicago gives a detailed analysis as to Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch.</ref><ref>Rearden, p. 458. \"There can be no moral doubt but that Chaucer knew Petrarch personally. They were both in France many times, where they might have met. They were both courtiers. They both had an enthusiasm for scholarship. Whether they met then, or whether Chaucer, when on his visit to Genoa, specially visited the Italian, it does not appear.\" \"...but the only reason that such a visit could not have occurred lies in the fact that Petrarch himself does not record it. Still, on the other hand, would he have mentioned the visit of a man who was the servant of a barbarous monarch, and whose only claim to notice, literary-wise, was his cultivation of an unknown and uncouth dialect that was half bastard French?\"</ref><ref>Skeat (1874), p. xxx. \"And we know that Petrarch, on his own shewing, was so pleased with the story of Griselda that he learnt it by heart as well as he could, for the express purpose of repeating it to friends, before the idea of turning it into Latin occurred to him. Whence we may conclude that Chaucer and Petrarch met at Padua early in 1373; that Petrarch told Chaucer the story by word of mouth, either in Italian or French; and that Chaucer shortly after obtained a copy of Petrarch's Latin version, which he kept constantly before him whilst making his own translation.\"</ref>\n\n==Genre and structure==\n[[File:Canterbury-Cathedral-Church-of-England-1890-1900.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Canterbury Cathedral]] from the north west [[circa|c.]] 1890\u20131900 (retouched from a black & white photograph)]]\n\n''The Canterbury Tales'' is a collection of stories built around a frame narrative or [[frame tale]], a common and already long established genre of its period. Chaucer's ''Tales'' differs from most other story \"collections\" in this genre chiefly in its intense variation. Most story collections focused on a theme, usually a religious one. Even in the ''Decameron'', storytellers are encouraged to stick to the theme decided on for the day. The idea of a [[pilgrimage]] to get such a diverse collection of people together for literary purposes was also unprecedented, though \"the association of pilgrims and storytelling was a familiar one\".<ref>\"Sources and Analogues of the Canterbury Tales\", 2002, p. 22.</ref> Introducing a competition among the tales encourages the reader to compare the tales in all their variety, and allows Chaucer to showcase the breadth of his skill in different genres and literary forms.<ref>Cooper, 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nWhile the structure of the ''Tales'' is largely linear, with one story following another, it is also much more than that. In the ''General Prologue'', Chaucer describes not the tales to be told, but the people who will tell them, making it clear that structure will depend on the characters rather than a general theme or moral. This idea is reinforced when the Miller interrupts to tell his tale after the Knight has finished his. Having the Knight go first gives one the idea that all will tell their stories by class, with the Monk following the Knight. However, the Miller's interruption makes it clear that this structure will be abandoned in favour of a free and open exchange of stories among all classes present. General themes and points of view arise as the characters tell their tales, which are responded to by other characters in their own tales, sometimes after a long lapse in which the theme has not been addressed.<ref>Cooper, 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nLastly, Chaucer does not pay much attention to the progress of the trip, to the time passing as the pilgrims travel, or to specific locations along the way to Canterbury. His writing of the story seems focused primarily on the stories being told, and not on the pilgrimage itself.<ref>Cooper, 18.</ref>\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Hengwrt Chaucer (f.2.r) title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of Geoffrey Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales'' in the hand of Adam Pinkhurst, c. 1400]]\n\nThe variety of Chaucer's tales shows the breadth of his skill and his familiarity with many literary forms, linguistic styles, and rhetorical devices. Medieval schools of rhetoric at the time encouraged such diversity, dividing literature (as [[Virgil]] suggests) into high, middle, and low styles as measured by the density of rhetorical forms and vocabulary. Another popular method of division came from [[St. Augustine]], who focused more on audience response and less on subject matter (a Virgilian concern). Augustine divided literature into \"majestic persuades\", \"temperate pleases\", and \"subdued teaches\". Writers were encouraged to write in a way that kept in mind the speaker, subject, audience, purpose, manner, and occasion. Chaucer moves freely between all of these styles, showing favouritism to none.<ref name=\"empathy article\">{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/tuesday-tome-canterbury-tales-geoffrey-chaucer/|title=Puppetry and the \"Popet:\" Fiction, Reality, and Empathy in Geoffrey Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales''|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=December 29, 2015|website=The Gemsbok|access-date=March 17, 2016}}</ref> He not only considers the readers of his work as an audience, but the other pilgrims within the story as well, creating a multi-layered rhetoric<ref>Cooper, 22\u201324.</ref>\n\nWith this, Chaucer avoids targeting any specific audience or social class of readers, focusing instead on the characters of the story and writing their tales with a skill proportional to their social status and learning. However, even the lowest characters, such as the Miller, show surprising rhetorical ability, although their subject matter is more lowbrow. Vocabulary also plays an important part, as those of the higher classes refer to a woman as a \"lady\", while the lower classes use the word \"wenche\", with no exceptions. At times the same word will mean entirely different things between classes. The word \"pitee\", for example, is a noble concept to the upper classes, while in the ''Merchant's Tale'' it refers to sexual intercourse. Again, however, tales such as the ''Nun's Priest's Tale'' show surprising skill with words among the lower classes of the group, while the ''Knight's Tale'' is at times extremely simple.<ref>Cooper, 24\u201325.</ref>\n\nChaucer uses the same meter throughout almost all of his tales, with the exception of ''Sir Thopas'' and his prose tales. It is a [[decasyllable]] line, probably borrowed from French and Italian forms, with [[riding rhyme]] and, occasionally, a [[caesura]] in the middle of a line. His meter would later develop into the heroic meter of the 15th and 16th centuries and is an ancestor of [[iambic pentameter]]. He avoids allowing couplets to become too prominent in the poem, and four of the tales (the Man of Law's, Clerk's, Prioress', and Second Nun's) use [[rhyme royal]].<ref>Cooper, 25\u201326.</ref>\n\n==Historical context and themes==\n[[File:DeathWatTylerFull.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381 is mentioned in the ''Tales''.]]\n\n''The Canterbury Tales'' was written during a turbulent time in English history. The Catholic Church was in the midst of the [[Western Schism]] and, although it was still the only Christian authority in Western Europe, it was the subject of heavy controversy. [[Lollardy]], an early English religious movement led by [[John Wycliffe]], is mentioned in the ''Tales'', which also mention a specific incident involving pardoners (sellers of [[indulgences]], which were believed to relieve the temporal punishment due for sins that were already forgiven in the [[Sacrament of Confession]]) who nefariously claimed to be collecting for St. Mary Rouncesval hospital in England. ''The Canterbury Tales'' is among the first English literary works to mention paper, a relatively new invention that allowed dissemination of the written word never before seen in England. Political clashes, such as the [[Peasants' Revolt|1381 Peasants' Revolt]] and clashes ending in the deposing of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], further reveal the complex turmoil surrounding Chaucer in the time of the ''Tales''' writing. Many of his close friends were executed and he himself moved to [[Kent]] to get away from events in London.<ref>Cooper, 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nWhile some readers look to interpret the characters of ''The Canterbury Tales'' as historical figures, other readers choose to interpret its significance in less literal terms. After analysis of Chaucer's diction and historical context, his work appears to develop a critique of society during his lifetime. Within a number of his descriptions, his comments can appear complimentary in nature, but through clever language, the statements are ultimately critical of the pilgrim's actions. It is unclear whether Chaucer would intend for the reader to link his characters with actual persons. Instead, it appears that Chaucer creates fictional characters to be general representations of people in such fields of work. With an understanding of medieval society, one can detect subtle satire at work.<ref>Donald R. Howard, ''Chaucer and the Medieval World'' (London, 1987), pp. 410\u201317.</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nThe ''Tales'' reflect diverse views of the Church in Chaucer's England. After the [[Black Death]], many Europeans began to question the authority of the established Church. Some turned to [[lollardy]], while others chose less extreme paths, starting new monastic orders or smaller movements exposing church corruption in the behaviour of the clergy, false [[relic|church relics]] or abuse of [[indulgences]].<ref>Bisson, pp. 49\u201351, 56\u201362.</ref> Several characters in the ''Tales'' are religious figures, and the very setting of the pilgrimage to Canterbury is religious (although the prologue comments ironically on its merely seasonal attractions), making religion a significant theme of the work.<ref>Bisson, p. 50.</ref>\n\nTwo characters, the Pardoner and the Summoner, whose roles apply the Church's secular power, are both portrayed as deeply corrupt, greedy, and abusive. Pardoners in Chaucer's day were those people from whom one bought Church \"indulgences\" for forgiveness of sins, who were guilty of abusing their office for their own gain. Chaucer's Pardoner openly admits the corruption of his practice while hawking his wares.<ref>Bisson, pp. 61\u201364.</ref> Summoners were Church officers who brought sinners to the Church court for possible excommunication and other penalties. Corrupt summoners would write false citations and frighten people into bribing them to protect their interests. Chaucer's Summoner is portrayed as guilty of the very kinds of sins for which he is threatening to bring others to court, and is hinted as having a corrupt relationship with the Pardoner.<ref>Bisson, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> In [[The Friar's Tale]], one of the characters is a summoner who is shown to be working on the side of the devil, not God.<ref>Bisson, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n[[File:Thomas Becket Murder.JPG|thumb|left|The murder of [[Thomas Becket]]]]\nChurchmen of various kinds are represented by the Monk, the Prioress, the Nun's Priest, and the Second Nun. Monastic orders, which originated from a desire to follow an ascetic lifestyle separated from the world, had by Chaucer's time become increasingly entangled in worldly matters. Monasteries frequently controlled huge tracts of land on which they made significant sums of money, while peasants worked in their employ.<ref>Bisson, pp. 73\u201375, 81.</ref> The Second Nun is an example of what a Nun was expected to be: her tale is about a woman whose chaste example brings people into the church. The Monk and the Prioress, on the other hand, while not as corrupt as the Summoner or Pardoner, fall far short of the ideal for their orders. Both are expensively dressed, show signs of lives of luxury and flirtatiousness and show a lack of spiritual depth.<ref>Bisson, pp. 91\u201395.</ref> [[The Prioress's Tale]] is an account of Jews murdering a deeply pious and innocent Christian boy, a [[blood libel against Jews]] that became a part of English literary tradition.<ref>Rubin, 106\u201307.</ref> The story did not originate in the works of Chaucer and was well known in the 14th century.<ref>[http://www.unc.edu/depts/chaucer/zatta/prioress.html \"The Prioress's Tale\"], by Prof. Jane Zatta.</ref>\n\nPilgrimage was a very prominent feature of medieval society. The ultimate pilgrimage destination was Jerusalem,<ref>Bisson, pp. 99\u201302.</ref> but within England Canterbury was a popular destination. Pilgrims would journey to cathedrals that preserved relics of saints, believing that such relics held miraculous powers. [[Thomas Becket|Saint Thomas Becket]], Archbishop of Canterbury, had been murdered in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by knights of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during a disagreement between Church and Crown. Miracle stories connected to his remains sprang up soon after his death, and the cathedral became a popular pilgrimage destination.<ref>Bisson, pp. 110\u201313.</ref> The pilgrimage in the work ties all of the stories together and may be considered a representation of Christians' striving for heaven, despite weaknesses, disagreement, and diversity of opinion.<ref>Bisson, pp. 117\u201319.</ref>\n\n===Social class and convention===\n[[File:Bors and Lionel.jpg|thumb|[[Bors]]' Dilemma \u2013 he chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]]]]\n\nThe upper class or nobility, represented chiefly by the Knight and his Squire, was in Chaucer's time steeped in a culture of chivalry and courtliness. Nobles were expected to be powerful warriors who could be ruthless on the battlefield yet mannerly in the King's Court and Christian in their actions.<ref>Bisson, pp. 123\u201331.</ref> Knights were expected to form a strong social bond with the men who fought alongside them, but an even stronger bond with a woman whom they idealised to strengthen their fighting ability.<ref>Bisson, pp. 132\u201334.</ref> Though the aim of chivalry was to noble action, its conflicting values often degenerated into violence. Church leaders frequently tried to place restrictions on jousts and tournaments, which at times ended in the death of the loser. [[The Knight's Tale]] shows how the brotherly love of two fellow knights turns into a deadly feud at the sight of a woman whom both idealise. To win her, both are willing to fight to the death. Chivalry was on the decline in Chaucer's day, and it is possible that The Knight's Tale was intended to show its flaws, although this is disputed.<ref>Bisson, pp. 139\u201342.</ref> Chaucer himself had fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] under [[Edward III]], who heavily emphasised chivalry during his reign.<ref>Bisson, p. 138.</ref> Two tales, ''[[Sir Topas]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Melibee]]'', are told by Chaucer himself, who is travelling with the pilgrims in his own story. Both tales seem to focus on the ill-effects of chivalry\u2014the first making fun of chivalric rules and the second warning against violence.<ref>Bisson, pp. 141\u201342.</ref>\n\nThe ''Tales'' constantly reflect the conflict between classes. For example, the division of [[Estates of the realm|the three estates]]: the characters are all divided into three distinct classes, the classes being \"those who pray\" (the clergy), \"those who fight\" (the nobility), and \"those who work\" (the commoners and peasantry).<ref>Bisson, p. 143.</ref> Most of the tales are interlinked by common themes, and some \"quit\" (reply to or retaliate against) other tales. Convention is followed when the Knight begins the game with a tale, as he represents the highest social class in the group. But when he is followed by the Miller, who represents a lower class, it sets the stage for the ''Tales'' to reflect both a respect for and a disregard for upper class rules. Helen Cooper, as well as Mikhail Bakhtin and Derek Brewer, call this opposition \"the ordered and the grotesque, [[Lent]] and [[Carnival]], officially approved culture and its riotous, and high-spirited underside.\"<ref name=opp>Cooper, 19</ref> Several works of the time contained the same opposition.<ref name=opp/>\n\n===Relativism versus realism===\nChaucer's characters each express different\u2014sometimes vastly different\u2014views of reality, creating an atmosphere of [[Playspace|testing]], [[empathy]], and [[relativism]].<ref name=\"empathy article\" /> As [[Helen Cooper (professor)|Helen Cooper]] says, \"Different genres give different readings of the world: the [[fabliau]] scarcely notices the operations of God, the saint's life focuses on those at the expense of physical reality, tracts and sermons insist on prudential or orthodox morality, romances privilege human emotion.\" The sheer number of varying persons and stories renders the ''Tales'' as a set unable to arrive at any definite truth or reality.<ref>Cooper, 21.</ref>\n\n===Liminality===\nThe concept of [[liminality]] figures prominently within ''The Canterbury Tales''.<ref name=\"empathy article\" /> A liminal space, which can be both geographical as well as metaphorical or spiritual, is the transitional or transformational space between a \u201creal\u201d (secure, known, limited) world and an unknown or imaginary space of both risk and possibility.<ref>Bishop, Norma J. \"Liminal Space in Travellers\u2019 Tales: Historical and Fictional Passages (Folklore, Ritual, History).\u201d Order No. 8615152 The Pennsylvania State University, 1986. Ann Arbor: ProQuest. Web. 30 Sep. 2015.</ref> The notion of a pilgrimage is itself a liminal experience, because it centres on travel between destinations and because pilgrims undertake it hoping to become more holy in the process. Thus, the structure of ''The Canterbury Tales'' itself is liminal; it not only covers the distance between London and Canterbury, but the majority of the tales refer to places entirely outside the geography of the pilgrimage. Jean Jost summarises the function of liminality in ''The Canterbury Tales'',\n\n{{Quote\n|Both appropriately and ironically in this raucous and subversive liminal space, a ragtag assembly gather together and tell their equally unconventional tales. In this unruly place, the rules of tale telling are established, themselves to be both disordered and broken; here the tales of game and earnest, solas and sentence, will be set and interrupted. Here the sacred and profane adventure begins, but does not end. Here, the condition of peril is as prominent as that of protection. The act of pilgrimaging itself consists of moving from one urban space, through liminal rural space, to the next urban space with an ever fluctuating series of events and narratives punctuating those spaces. The goal of pilgrimage may well be a religious or spiritual space at its conclusion, and reflect a psychological progression of the spirit, in yet another kind of emotional space.<ref>Jost, Jean. \"Urban and Liminal Space in Chaucer's Knight's Tale: Perilous or Protective?\" Albrecht Classen, ed.

An obvious instance of this is the [[The Friar's Tale|Friar's Tale]] in which the yeoman devil is a liminal figure because of his transitory nature and function; it is his purpose to issue souls from their current existence to hell, an entirely different one.<ref>Bloomfield, Morton W. \"The 'Friar's Tale' as a Liminal Tale\".

Print.</ref>\n\n==Influence on literature==\nIt is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution that this work made to [[English literature]] was in popularising the literary use of the [[vernacular]] English, rather than French or [[Latin]]. English had, however, been used as a literary language for centuries before Chaucer's life, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries\u2014[[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], and [[the Pearl Poet]]\u2014also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was responsible for starting a trend rather than simply being part of it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Although Chaucer had a powerful influence in poetic and artistic terms, which can be seen in the great number of forgeries and mistaken attributions (such as ''[[The Floure and the Leafe]]'', which was translated by [[John Dryden]]), modern English spelling and orthography owe much more to the innovations made by the [[Court of Chancery]] in the decades during and after his lifetime.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Chaucer ellesmere.jpg|thumb|left|Chaucer as a Pilgrim from the [[Ellesmere manuscript]].]]\n[[File:Wife-of-Bath-ms.jpg|thumb|right|Opening prologue of [[The Wife of Bath's Tale]] from the Ellesmere Manuscript.]]\n\nWhile Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems (the ''[[Book of the Duchess]]'' is believed to have been written for [[John of Gaunt]] on the occasion of his wife's death in 1368), the intended audience of ''The Canterbury Tales'' is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a [[courtier]], leading some to believe that he was mainly a [[court poet]] who wrote exclusively for the nobility. He is referred to as a noble translator and poet by [[Eustache Deschamps]] and by his contemporary John Gower. It has been suggested that the poem was intended to be read aloud, which is probable as this was a common activity at the time. However, it also seems to have been intended for private reading as well, since Chaucer frequently refers to himself as the writer, rather than the speaker, of the work. Determining the intended audience directly from the text is even more difficult, since the audience is part of the story. This makes it difficult to tell when Chaucer is writing to the fictional pilgrim audience or the actual reader.<ref>Pearsall, 294\u201395.</ref>\n\nChaucer's works may have been distributed in some form during his lifetime in part or in whole. Scholars speculate that manuscripts were circulated among his friends, but likely remained unknown to most people until after his death. However, the speed with which copyists strove to write complete versions of his tale in manuscript form shows that Chaucer was a famous and respected poet in his own day. The Hengwrt and Ellesmere manuscripts are examples of the care taken to distribute the work. More manuscript copies of the poem exist than for any other poem of its day except ''[[The Prick of Conscience]]'', causing some scholars to give it the medieval equivalent of bestseller status. Even the most elegant of the illustrated manuscripts, however, is not nearly as highly decorated as the work of authors of more respectable works such as [[John Lydgate]]'s religious and historical literature.<ref>Pearsall, 295\u201397.</ref>\n\n===15th century===\nJohn Lydgate and [[Thomas Occleve]] were among the first critics of Chaucer's ''Tales'', praising the poet as the greatest English poet of all time and the first to show what the language was truly capable of poetically. This sentiment was universally agreed upon by later critics into the mid-15th century. Glosses included in ''The Canterbury Tales'' manuscripts of the time praised him highly for his skill with \"sentence\" and rhetoric, the two pillars by which medieval critics judged poetry. The most respected of the tales was at this time the Knight's, as it was full of both.<ref>Pearsall, 298\u2013302.</ref>\n\n==Literary additions and supplements==\nThe incompleteness of the ''Tales'' led several medieval authors to write additions and supplements to the tales to make them more complete. Some of the oldest existing manuscripts of the tales include new or modified tales, showing that even early on, such additions were being created. These emendations included various expansions of the ''Cook's Tale'', which Chaucer never finished, ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', ''[[The Tale of Gamelyn]]'', the ''[[Siege of Thebes (Lydgate)|Siege of Thebes]]'', and the ''[[Tale of Beryn]]''.<ref>Trigg, Stephanie, ''Congenial Souls: Reading Chaucer from Medieval to Postmodern'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2002, p. 86. {{ISBN|0-8166-3823-3}}.</ref>\n\nThe ''Tale of Beryn'', written by an anonymous author in the 15th century, is preceded by a lengthy prologue in which the pilgrims arrive at Canterbury and their activities there are described. While the rest of the pilgrims disperse throughout the town, the Pardoner seeks the affections of Kate the barmaid, but faces problems dealing with the man in her life and the innkeeper Harry Bailey. As the pilgrims turn back home, the Merchant restarts the storytelling with ''Tale of Beryn''. In this tale, a young man named Beryn travels from Rome to Egypt to seek his fortune only to be cheated by other businessmen there. He is then aided by a local man in getting his revenge. The tale comes from the French tale ''[[B\u00e9rinus]]'' and exists in a single early manuscript of the tales, although it was printed along with the tales in a 1721 edition by [[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry]].<ref>Trigg, pp. 86\u201388, 97.</ref>\n\nJohn Lydgate wrote ''The Siege of Thebes'' in about 1420. Like the ''Tale of Beryn'', it is preceded by a prologue in which the pilgrims arrive in Canterbury. Lydgate places himself among the pilgrims as one of them and describes how he was a part of Chaucer's trip and heard the stories. He characterises himself as a monk and tells a long story about the history of Thebes before the events of the ''Knight's Tale''. John Lydgate's tale was popular early on and exists in old manuscripts both on its own and as part of the ''Tales''. It was first printed as early as 1561 by [[John Stow]], and several editions for centuries after followed suit.<ref>Trigg, pp. 88\u201397.</ref>\n\nThere are actually two versions of ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', both of which are influenced by the story ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', a work written during Chaucer's lifetime. Chaucer describes a Plowman in the ''General Prologue'' of his tales, but never gives him his own tale. One tale, written by [[Thomas Occleve]], describes the miracle of the Virgin and the Sleeveless Garment. Another tale features a pelican and a griffin debating church corruption, with the pelican taking a position of protest akin to [[John Wycliffe]]'s ideas.<ref>Brewer, Charlotte, ''Editing Piers Plowman: The Evolution of the Text'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 8\u20139. {{ISBN|0-521-34250-3}}.</ref>\n\n''The Tale of Gamelyn'' was included in an early manuscript version of the tales, Harley 7334, which is notorious for being one of the lower-quality early manuscripts in terms of editor error and alteration. It is now widely rejected by scholars as an authentic Chaucerian tale, although some scholars think he may have intended to rewrite the story as a tale for the Yeoman. Dates for its authorship vary from 1340 to 1370.<ref>Ohlgren, Thomas, ''Medieval Outlaws'', Parlor Press, 2005, pp. 264\u201365. {{ISBN|1-932559-62-0}}.</ref>\n\n==Literary adaptations==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}\n\nMany literary works (both fiction and non-fiction alike) have used a similar frame narrative to ''The Canterbury Tales'' as an homage. Science-fiction writer [[Dan Simmons]] wrote his [[Hugo Award]] winning novel ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]'' based on an extra-planetary group of pilgrims. Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] used ''The Canterbury Tales'' as a structure for his 2004 non-fiction book about [[evolution]] titled ''[[The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution]]''. His animal pilgrims are on their way to find the common ancestor, each telling a tale about evolution.\n\n[[Henry Dudeney]]'s book ''[[The Canterbury Puzzles]]'' contains a part reputedly lost from what modern readers know as Chaucer's tales.\n\nHistorical-mystery novelist [[P.C. Doherty]] wrote a series of novels based on ''The Canterbury Tales'', making use of both the story frame and Chaucer's characters.\n\nCanadian author [[Angie Abdou]] translates ''The Canterbury Tales'' to a cross section of people, all snow-sports enthusiasts but from different social backgrounds, converging on a remote back-country ski cabin in British Columbia in the 2011 novel ''The Canterbury Trail''.\n\n==Adaptations and homages==\n''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'', by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, a retelling of \"The Knight's Tale\", was first performed in 1613 or 1614 and published in 1634. In 1961, [[Erik Chisholm]] completed his opera, ''The Canterbury Tales''. The opera is in three acts: The Wyf of Bath's Tale, The Pardoner's Tale and The Nun's Priest's Tale. [[Nevill Coghill]]'s modern English version formed the basis of a musical [[Canterbury Tales (musical)|version]] that was first staged in 1964.\n\n''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'', a 1944 film jointly written and directed by [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]], is loosely based on the narrative frame of Chaucer's tales. The movie opens with a group of medieval pilgrims journeying through the Kentish countryside as a narrator speaks the opening lines of the ''General Prologue''. The scene then makes a [[Match cut#Notable examples|now-famous transition]] to the time of World War II. From that point on, the film follows a group of strangers, each with his or her own story and in need of some kind of redemption, who are making their way to Canterbury together. The film's main story takes place in an imaginary town in Kent and ends with the main characters arriving at Canterbury Cathedral, bells pealing and Chaucer's words again resounding. ''A Canterbury Tale'' is recognised as one of the Powell-Pressburger team's most poetic and artful films. It was produced as wartime propaganda, using Chaucer's poetry, referring to the famous pilgrimage, and offering photography of Kent to remind the public of what made Britain worth fighting for. In one scene a local historian lectures an audience of British soldiers about the pilgrims of Chaucer's time and the vibrant history of England.<ref>Ellis, Steve, ''Chaucer at Large'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2000, pp. 64\u201365. {{ISBN|0-8166-3376-2}}.</ref>\n\n[[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s 1972 film ''[[The Canterbury Tales (film)|The Canterbury Tales]]'' features several of the tales, some of which keep close to the original tale and some of which are embellished. The ''Cook's Tale'', for instance, which is incomplete in the original version, is expanded into a full story, and the ''Friar's Tale'' extends the scene in which the Summoner is dragged down to hell. The film includes these two tales as well as the ''Miller's Tale'', the ''Summoner's Tale'', the ''Wife of Bath's Tale'', and the ''Merchant's Tale''.<ref>Pencak, William, ''The Films of Derek Jarman'', Jefferson: McFarland & Co, 2002, pp. 178\u20139. {{ISBN|0-7864-1430-8}}.</ref>\n\nOn 26 April 1986, American radio personality [[Garrison Keillor]] opened \"The News from Lake Wobegon\" portion of the first live TV broadcast of his ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' radio show with a reading of the original Middle English text of the General Prologue.  He commented, \"Although those words were written more than 600 years ago, they still describe spring.\"\n\nTelevision adaptations include [[Alan Plater]]'s 1975 re-telling of the stories in a series of plays for BBC2: ''[[Trinity Tales]]''. In 2003, the BBC again featured [[The Canterbury Tales (TV series)|modern re-tellings of selected tales]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/canterburytales/ |title=Canterbury Tales |accessdate=6 May 2007 |publisher=BBC Drama}}</ref>\n\n{{Panorama |image=File:Canterbury-west-Winter-Highsmith.jpeg |fullwidth=6900 |fullheight=825 |height=165 |caption= [[Ezra Winter]], ''Canterbury Tales'' mural (1939), [[Library of Congress]] [[John Adams Building]], Washington, D.C.

An Age of Plague 1300\u20131400 }}</ref> It was during these years that Chaucer began working on his most famous text, ''The Canterbury Tales''. The tales (mostly written in [[verse (poetry)|verse]], although some are in [[prose]]) are presented as part of a story-telling contest by a group of [[pilgrim]]s as they travel together from London to [[Canterbury]] to visit the shrine of Saint [[Thomas Becket]] at [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. The prize for this contest is a free meal at the [[The Tabard|Tabard Inn]] at Southwark on their return.\n\nAfter a long list of works written earlier in his career, including ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', ''[[House of Fame]]'', and ''[[Parlement of Foules|Parliament of Fowls]]'', ''The Canterbury Tales'' is near-unanimously seen as Chaucer's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. He uses the tales and descriptions of its characters to paint an ironic and critical portrait of English society at the time, and particularly of the Church. Chaucer's use of such a wide range of classes and types of people was without precedent in English. Although the characters are fictional, they still offer a variety of insights into customs and practices of the time. Often, such insight leads to a variety of discussions and disagreements among people in the 14th century. For example, although various social classes are represented in these stories and all of the pilgrims are on a spiritual quest, it is apparent that they are more concerned with worldly things than spiritual. Structurally, the collection resembles [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio's]] ''[[Decameron]]'', which Chaucer may have read during his first diplomatic mission to [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] in 1372.\n\nIt has been suggested that the greatest contribution of ''The Canterbury Tales'' to [[English literature]] was the popularisation of the English [[vernacular]] in mainstream literature, as opposed to French, Italian or [[Latin]]. English had, however, been used as a literary language centuries before Chaucer's time, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries\u2014[[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], [[the Pearl Poet]], and [[Julian of Norwich]]\u2014also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was seminal in this evolution of literary preference.\n\nWhile Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems, the intended audience of ''The Canterbury Tales'' is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a [[courtier]], leading some to believe that he was mainly a court poet who wrote exclusively for nobility.\n\n''The Canterbury Tales'' is generally thought to have been incomplete at the end of Chaucer's life. In the [[General Prologue]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = Geoffrey Chaucer (1342\u20131400) \"The Canterbury Tales\" (in middle english and modern english)|url = http://www.librarius.com/cantales.htm|website = www.librarius.com|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}</ref> some 30 pilgrims are introduced. According to the Prologue, Chaucer's intention was to write four stories from the perspective of each pilgrim, two each on the way to and from their ultimate destination, St. Thomas Becket's shrine (making for a total of about 120 stories). Although perhaps incomplete, ''The Canterbury Tales'' is revered as one of the most important works in English literature. It is also open to a wide range of interpretations.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature|last = Black|first = Joseph|publisher = Broadview Press|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Canada|pages = 229\u2013331}}</ref>\n\n==Text==\nThe question of whether ''The Canterbury Tales'' is a finished work has not been answered to date. There are 84 manuscripts and four [[incunabula]] (printed before c 1540) editions of the work, dating from the late medieval and early Renaissance periods, more than for any other vernacular literary text with the exception of ''[[The Prick of Conscience]]''. This is taken as evidence of the ''Tales''' popularity during the century after Chaucer's death.<ref name=\"Pearsall, 8\">Pearsall, 8.</ref> Fifty-five of these manuscripts are thought to have been originally complete, while 28 are so fragmentary that it is difficult to ascertain whether they were copied individually or as part of a set.<ref>Cooper, 6\u20137</ref> The ''Tales'' vary in both minor and major ways from manuscript to manuscript; many of the minor variations are due to copyists' errors, while it is suggested that in other cases Chaucer both added to his work and revised it as it was being copied and possibly as it was being distributed. Determining the text of the work is complicated by the question of the narrator's voice which Chaucer made part of his literary structure.\n\nEven the oldest surviving manuscripts of the ''Tales'' are not Chaucer's originals. The very oldest is probably MS Peniarth 392 D (called \"[[Hengwrt Chaucer|Hengwrt]]\"), written by a scribe shortly after Chaucer's death. Another famous example is the [[Ellesmere Chaucer|Ellesmere Manuscript]], a manuscript handwritten by one person with illustrations by several illustrators; the tales are put in an order that many later editors have followed for centuries.<ref>Pearsall, 10, 17.</ref><ref>Cooper, 8.</ref> The first version of ''The Canterbury Tales'' to be published in print was [[William Caxton]]'s 1476 edition. Only 10 copies of this edition are known to exist, including one held by the [[British Library]] and one held by the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]].\n\nIn 2004, Linne Mooney claimed that she was able to identify the [[scrivener]] who worked for Chaucer as an [[Adam Pinkhurst]]. Mooney, then a professor at the [[University of Maine]] and a visiting fellow at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], said she could match Pinkhurst's signature, on an oath he signed, to his handwriting on a copy of ''The Canterbury Tales'' that might have been transcribed from Chaucer's working copy.<ref>Linne R.

Some scholarly editions divide the ''Tales'' into ten \"Fragments\". The tales that make up a Fragment are closely related and contain internal indications of their order of presentation, usually with one character speaking to and then stepping aside for another character. However, between Fragments, the connection is less obvious. Consequently, there are several possible orders; the one most frequently seen in modern editions follows the numbering of the Fragments (ultimately based on the Ellesmere order).<ref name = seven/> Victorians frequently used the nine \"Groups\", which was the order used by [[Walter William Skeat]] whose edition ''Chaucer: Complete Works'' was used by Oxford University Press for most of the twentieth century, but this order is now{{when|date=March 2018}} seldom followed.<ref name = seven/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:50%\"\n!  width=\"15%\" | Fragment\n!  width=\"5%\"  | Group\n!  width=\"30%\" class=\"unsortable\" | Tales\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">01</span>Fragment I || A\n|\n* [[General Prologue]],\n* [[The Knight's Tale]],\n* [[The Miller's Tale]],\n* [[The Reeve's Tale]],\n* [[The Cook's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">02</span>Fragment II || B<sup>1</sup>\n|\n* [[The Man of Law's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">03</span>Fragment III || D\n|\n* [[The Wife of Bath's Tale]],\n* [[The Friar's Tale]],\n* [[The Summoner's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">04</span>Fragment IV || E\n|\n* [[The Clerk's Tale]],\n* [[The Merchant's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">05</span>Fragment V || F\n|\n* [[The Squire's Tale]],\n* [[The Franklin's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">06</span>Fragment VI || C\n|\n* [[The Physician's Tale]],\n* [[The Pardoner's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">07</span>Fragment VII || B<sup>2</sup>\n|\n* [[The Shipman's Tale]],\n* [[The Prioress's Tale]],\n* [[Sir Thopas]]' Tale,\n* [[The Tale of Melibee]],\n* [[The Monk's Tale]],\n* [[The Nun's Priest's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">08</span>Fragment VIII || G\n|\n* [[The Second Nun's Tale]],\n* [[The Canon's Yeoman's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">09</span>Fragment IX || H\n|\n* [[The Manciple's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">10</span>Fragment X || I\n|\n* [[The Parson's Tale]]\n|}\n\nAn alternative ordering (seen in an early manuscript containing ''The Canterbury Tales'', the early-fifteenth century [[Harley MS. 7334]]) places Fragment VIII before VI.

From philological research, some facts are known about the pronunciation of English during the time of Chaucer. Chaucer pronounced ''-e'' at the end of many words, so that ''care'' was {{IPA-enm|\u02c8ka\u02d0r\u0259|}}, not {{IPAc-en|k|\u025b\u0259r}} as in Modern English. Other silent letters were also pronounced, so that the word ''knight'' was {{IPA|[kni\u00e7t]}}, with both the ''k'' and the ''gh'' pronounced, not {{IPAc-en|n|a\u026a|t}}. In some cases, vowel letters in Middle English were pronounced very differently from Modern English, because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] had not yet happened. For instance, the long ''e'' in ''wepyng'' \"weeping\" was pronounced as {{IPA-enm|e\u02d0|}}, as in modern German or Italian, not as {{IPAc-en|i\u02d0}}.

It is obvious, however, that Chaucer borrowed portions, sometimes very large portions, of his stories from earlier stories, and that his work was influenced by the general state of the literary world in which he lived. Storytelling was the main entertainment in England at the time, and storytelling contests had been around for hundreds of years. In 14th-century England the English [[Pui (society)|Pui]] was a group with an appointed leader who would judge the songs of the group. The winner received a crown and, as with the winner of ''The Canterbury Tales'', a free dinner. It was common for pilgrims on a pilgrimage to have a chosen \"master of ceremonies\" to guide them and organise the journey.<ref>Cooper, p. 10.</ref> [[Harold Bloom]] suggests that the structure is mostly original, but inspired by the \"pilgrim\" figures of Dante and Virgil in ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]''.<ref name=\"Harold Bloom\">{{cite news|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Road Trip|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/review/Bloom-t.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 September 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 November 2009}}</ref> New research suggests that the General Prologue, in which the innkeeper and host Harry Bailey introduces each pilgrim, is a pastiche of the historical Harry Bailey's surviving 1381 poll-tax account of Southwark's inhabitants.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sobecki|first1=Sebastian|title=A Southwark Tale: Gower, the 1381 Poll Tax, and Chaucer's ''The Canterbury Tales''|journal=Speculum|date=2017|volume=92|issue=3|pages=630\u201360|doi=10.1086/692620|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/44079043/692620.pdf}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Decameron]]'' by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] contains more parallels to ''The Canterbury Tales'' than any other work. Like the ''Tales'', it features a number of narrators who tell stories along a journey they have undertaken (to flee from the [[Black Death]]). It ends with an apology by Boccaccio, much like [[Chaucer's Retraction]] to the ''Tales''. A quarter of the tales in ''The Canterbury Tales'' parallel a tale in the ''Decameron'', although most of them have closer parallels in other stories. Some scholars thus find it unlikely that Chaucer had a copy of the work on hand, surmising instead that he may have merely read the ''Decameron'' at some point.<ref>Cooper, pp. 10\u201311.</ref> Each of the tales has its own set of sources that have been suggested by scholars, but a few sources are used frequently over several tales. They include poetry by [[Ovid]], the Bible in one of the many vulgate versions in which it was available at the time (the exact one is difficult to determine), and the works of [[Petrarch]] and [[Dante]]. Chaucer was the first author to use the work of these last two, both Italians. [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' appears in several tales, as the works of [[John Gower]] do. Gower was a known friend to Chaucer. Chaucer also seems to have borrowed from numerous religious encyclopaedias and liturgical writings, such as [[John Bromyard]]'s ''[[Summa praedicantium]]'', a preacher's handbook, and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Against Jovinianus|Adversus Jovinianum]]''.<ref>Cooper, pp. 12\u201316.</ref> Many scholars say there is a good possibility [[Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio|Chaucer met Petrarch or Boccaccio]].<ref name=\"Brewer227\">Brewer, p. 227. \"Although Chaucer undoubtedly studied the works of these celebrated writers, and particularly of Dante before this fortunate interview; yet it seems likely, that these excursions gave him a new relish for their compositions, and enlarged his knowledge of the Italian fables.''</ref><ref name=\"Brewer277\">Brewer, p. 277.\"...where he became thoroughly inbued with the spirit and excellence of the great Italian poets and prose-writers: Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio; and is said to have had a personal contact interview with one of these, Petrarch.\"</ref><ref name=\"Hendrickson183-192\">Hendrickson, pp. 183\u201392. Professor G. L. Hendrickson of the University of Chicago gives a detailed analysis as to Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch.</ref><ref>Rearden, p. 458. \"There can be no moral doubt but that Chaucer knew Petrarch personally. They were both in France many times, where they might have met. They were both courtiers. They both had an enthusiasm for scholarship. Whether they met then, or whether Chaucer, when on his visit to Genoa, specially visited the Italian, it does not appear.\" \"...but the only reason that such a visit could not have occurred lies in the fact that Petrarch himself does not record it. Still, on the other hand, would he have mentioned the visit of a man who was the servant of a barbarous monarch, and whose only claim to notice, literary-wise, was his cultivation of an unknown and uncouth dialect that was half bastard French?\"</ref><ref>Skeat (1874), p. xxx. \"And we know that Petrarch, on his own shewing, was so pleased with the story of Griselda that he learnt it by heart as well as he could, for the express purpose of repeating it to friends, before the idea of turning it into Latin occurred to him. Whence we may conclude that Chaucer and Petrarch met at Padua early in 1373; that Petrarch told Chaucer the story by word of mouth, either in Italian or French; and that Chaucer shortly after obtained a copy of Petrarch's Latin version, which he kept constantly before him whilst making his own translation.\"</ref>\n\n==Genre and structure==\n[[File:Canterbury-Cathedral-Church-of-England-1890-1900.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Canterbury Cathedral]] from the north west [[circa|c.]] 1890\u20131900 (retouched from a black & white photograph)]]\n\n''The Canterbury Tales'' is a collection of stories built around a frame narrative or [[frame tale]], a common and already long established genre of its period. Chaucer's ''Tales'' differs from most other story \"collections\" in this genre chiefly in its intense variation. Most story collections focused on a theme, usually a religious one. Even in the ''Decameron'', storytellers are encouraged to stick to the theme decided on for the day. The idea of a [[pilgrimage]] to get such a diverse collection of people together for literary purposes was also unprecedented, though \"the association of pilgrims and storytelling was a familiar one\".<ref>\"Sources and Analogues of the Canterbury Tales\", 2002, p. 22.</ref> Introducing a competition among the tales encourages the reader to compare the tales in all their variety, and allows Chaucer to showcase the breadth of his skill in different genres and literary forms.<ref>Cooper, 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nWhile the structure of the ''Tales'' is largely linear, with one story following another, it is also much more than that. In the ''General Prologue'', Chaucer describes not the tales to be told, but the people who will tell them, making it clear that structure will depend on the characters rather than a general theme or moral. This idea is reinforced when the Miller interrupts to tell his tale after the Knight has finished his. Having the Knight go first gives one the idea that all will tell their stories by class, with the Monk following the Knight. However, the Miller's interruption makes it clear that this structure will be abandoned in favour of a free and open exchange of stories among all classes present. General themes and points of view arise as the characters tell their tales, which are responded to by other characters in their own tales, sometimes after a long lapse in which the theme has not been addressed.<ref>Cooper, 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nLastly, Chaucer does not pay much attention to the progress of the trip, to the time passing as the pilgrims travel, or to specific locations along the way to Canterbury. His writing of the story seems focused primarily on the stories being told, and not on the pilgrimage itself.<ref>Cooper, 18.</ref>\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Hengwrt Chaucer (f.2.r) title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of Geoffrey Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales'' in the hand of Adam Pinkhurst, c. 1400]]\n\nThe variety of Chaucer's tales shows the breadth of his skill and his familiarity with many literary forms, linguistic styles, and rhetorical devices. Medieval schools of rhetoric at the time encouraged such diversity, dividing literature (as [[Virgil]] suggests) into high, middle, and low styles as measured by the density of rhetorical forms and vocabulary. Another popular method of division came from [[St. Augustine]], who focused more on audience response and less on subject matter (a Virgilian concern). Augustine divided literature into \"majestic persuades\", \"temperate pleases\", and \"subdued teaches\". Writers were encouraged to write in a way that kept in mind the speaker, subject, audience, purpose, manner, and occasion. Chaucer moves freely between all of these styles, showing favouritism to none.<ref name=\"empathy article\">{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/tuesday-tome-canterbury-tales-geoffrey-chaucer/|title=Puppetry and the \"Popet:\" Fiction, Reality, and Empathy in Geoffrey Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales''|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=December 29, 2015|website=The Gemsbok|access-date=March 17, 2016}}</ref> He not only considers the readers of his work as an audience, but the other pilgrims within the story as well, creating a multi-layered rhetoric<ref>Cooper, 22\u201324.</ref>\n\nWith this, Chaucer avoids targeting any specific audience or social class of readers, focusing instead on the characters of the story and writing their tales with a skill proportional to their social status and learning. However, even the lowest characters, such as the Miller, show surprising rhetorical ability, although their subject matter is more lowbrow. Vocabulary also plays an important part, as those of the higher classes refer to a woman as a \"lady\", while the lower classes use the word \"wenche\", with no exceptions. At times the same word will mean entirely different things between classes. The word \"pitee\", for example, is a noble concept to the upper classes, while in the ''Merchant's Tale'' it refers to sexual intercourse. Again, however, tales such as the ''Nun's Priest's Tale'' show surprising skill with words among the lower classes of the group, while the ''Knight's Tale'' is at times extremely simple.<ref>Cooper, 24\u201325.</ref>\n\nChaucer uses the same meter throughout almost all of his tales, with the exception of ''Sir Thopas'' and his prose tales. It is a [[decasyllable]] line, probably borrowed from French and Italian forms, with [[riding rhyme]] and, occasionally, a [[caesura]] in the middle of a line. His meter would later develop into the heroic meter of the 15th and 16th centuries and is an ancestor of [[iambic pentameter]]. He avoids allowing couplets to become too prominent in the poem, and four of the tales (the Man of Law's, Clerk's, Prioress', and Second Nun's) use [[rhyme royal]].<ref>Cooper, 25\u201326.</ref>\n\n==Historical context and themes==\n[[File:DeathWatTylerFull.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381 is mentioned in the ''Tales''.]]\n\n''The Canterbury Tales'' was written during a turbulent time in English history. The Catholic Church was in the midst of the [[Western Schism]] and, although it was still the only Christian authority in Western Europe, it was the subject of heavy controversy. [[Lollardy]], an early English religious movement led by [[John Wycliffe]], is mentioned in the ''Tales'', which also mention a specific incident involving pardoners (sellers of [[indulgences]], which were believed to relieve the temporal punishment due for sins that were already forgiven in the [[Sacrament of Confession]]) who nefariously claimed to be collecting for St. Mary Rouncesval hospital in England. ''The Canterbury Tales'' is among the first English literary works to mention paper, a relatively new invention that allowed dissemination of the written word never before seen in England. Political clashes, such as the [[Peasants' Revolt|1381 Peasants' Revolt]] and clashes ending in the deposing of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], further reveal the complex turmoil surrounding Chaucer in the time of the ''Tales''' writing. Many of his close friends were executed and he himself moved to [[Kent]] to get away from events in London.<ref>Cooper, 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nWhile some readers look to interpret the characters of ''The Canterbury Tales'' as historical figures, other readers choose to interpret its significance in less literal terms. After analysis of Chaucer's diction and historical context, his work appears to develop a critique of society during his lifetime. Within a number of his descriptions, his comments can appear complimentary in nature, but through clever language, the statements are ultimately critical of the pilgrim's actions. It is unclear whether Chaucer would intend for the reader to link his characters with actual persons. Instead, it appears that Chaucer creates fictional characters to be general representations of people in such fields of work. With an understanding of medieval society, one can detect subtle satire at work.<ref>Donald R. Howard, ''Chaucer and the Medieval World'' (London, 1987), pp. 410\u201317.</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nThe ''Tales'' reflect diverse views of the Church in Chaucer's England. After the [[Black Death]], many Europeans began to question the authority of the established Church. Some turned to [[lollardy]], while others chose less extreme paths, starting new monastic orders or smaller movements exposing church corruption in the behaviour of the clergy, false [[relic|church relics]] or abuse of [[indulgences]].<ref>Bisson, pp. 49\u201351, 56\u201362.</ref> Several characters in the ''Tales'' are religious figures, and the very setting of the pilgrimage to Canterbury is religious (although the prologue comments ironically on its merely seasonal attractions), making religion a significant theme of the work.<ref>Bisson, p. 50.</ref>\n\nTwo characters, the Pardoner and the Summoner, whose roles apply the Church's secular power, are both portrayed as deeply corrupt, greedy, and abusive. Pardoners in Chaucer's day were those people from whom one bought Church \"indulgences\" for forgiveness of sins, who were guilty of abusing their office for their own gain. Chaucer's Pardoner openly admits the corruption of his practice while hawking his wares.<ref>Bisson, pp. 61\u201364.</ref> Summoners were Church officers who brought sinners to the Church court for possible excommunication and other penalties. Corrupt summoners would write false citations and frighten people into bribing them to protect their interests. Chaucer's Summoner is portrayed as guilty of the very kinds of sins for which he is threatening to bring others to court, and is hinted as having a corrupt relationship with the Pardoner.<ref>Bisson, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> In [[The Friar's Tale]], one of the characters is a summoner who is shown to be working on the side of the devil, not God.<ref>Bisson, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n[[File:Thomas Becket Murder.JPG|thumb|left|The murder of [[Thomas Becket]]]]\nChurchmen of various kinds are represented by the Monk, the Prioress, the Nun's Priest, and the Second Nun. Monastic orders, which originated from a desire to follow an ascetic lifestyle separated from the world, had by Chaucer's time become increasingly entangled in worldly matters. Monasteries frequently controlled huge tracts of land on which they made significant sums of money, while peasants worked in their employ.<ref>Bisson, pp. 73\u201375, 81.</ref> The Second Nun is an example of what a Nun was expected to be: her tale is about a woman whose chaste example brings people into the church. The Monk and the Prioress, on the other hand, while not as corrupt as the Summoner or Pardoner, fall far short of the ideal for their orders. Both are expensively dressed, show signs of lives of luxury and flirtatiousness and show a lack of spiritual depth.<ref>Bisson, pp. 91\u201395.</ref> [[The Prioress's Tale]] is an account of Jews murdering a deeply pious and innocent Christian boy, a [[blood libel against Jews]] that became a part of English literary tradition.<ref>Rubin, 106\u201307.</ref> The story did not originate in the works of Chaucer and was well known in the 14th century.<ref>[http://www.unc.edu/depts/chaucer/zatta/prioress.html \"The Prioress's Tale\"], by Prof. Jane Zatta.</ref>\n\nPilgrimage was a very prominent feature of medieval society. The ultimate pilgrimage destination was Jerusalem,<ref>Bisson, pp. 99\u201302.</ref> but within England Canterbury was a popular destination. Pilgrims would journey to cathedrals that preserved relics of saints, believing that such relics held miraculous powers. [[Thomas Becket|Saint Thomas Becket]], Archbishop of Canterbury, had been murdered in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by knights of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during a disagreement between Church and Crown. Miracle stories connected to his remains sprang up soon after his death, and the cathedral became a popular pilgrimage destination.<ref>Bisson, pp. 110\u201313.</ref> The pilgrimage in the work ties all of the stories together and may be considered a representation of Christians' striving for heaven, despite weaknesses, disagreement, and diversity of opinion.<ref>Bisson, pp. 117\u201319.</ref>\n\n===Social class and convention===\n[[File:Bors and Lionel.jpg|thumb|[[Bors]]' Dilemma \u2013 he chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]]]]\n\nThe upper class or nobility, represented chiefly by the Knight and his Squire, was in Chaucer's time steeped in a culture of chivalry and courtliness. Nobles were expected to be powerful warriors who could be ruthless on the battlefield yet mannerly in the King's Court and Christian in their actions.<ref>Bisson, pp. 123\u201331.</ref> Knights were expected to form a strong social bond with the men who fought alongside them, but an even stronger bond with a woman whom they idealised to strengthen their fighting ability.<ref>Bisson, pp. 132\u201334.</ref> Though the aim of chivalry was to noble action, its conflicting values often degenerated into violence. Church leaders frequently tried to place restrictions on jousts and tournaments, which at times ended in the death of the loser. [[The Knight's Tale]] shows how the brotherly love of two fellow knights turns into a deadly feud at the sight of a woman whom both idealise. To win her, both are willing to fight to the death. Chivalry was on the decline in Chaucer's day, and it is possible that The Knight's Tale was intended to show its flaws, although this is disputed.<ref>Bisson, pp. 139\u201342.</ref> Chaucer himself had fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] under [[Edward III]], who heavily emphasised chivalry during his reign.<ref>Bisson, p. 138.</ref> Two tales, ''[[Sir Topas]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Melibee]]'', are told by Chaucer himself, who is travelling with the pilgrims in his own story. Both tales seem to focus on the ill-effects of chivalry\u2014the first making fun of chivalric rules and the second warning against violence.<ref>Bisson, pp. 141\u201342.</ref>\n\nThe ''Tales'' constantly reflect the conflict between classes. For example, the division of [[Estates of the realm|the three estates]]: the characters are all divided into three distinct classes, the classes being \"those who pray\" (the clergy), \"those who fight\" (the nobility), and \"those who work\" (the commoners and peasantry).<ref>Bisson, p. 143.</ref> Most of the tales are interlinked by common themes, and some \"quit\" (reply to or retaliate against) other tales. Convention is followed when the Knight begins the game with a tale, as he represents the highest social class in the group. But when he is followed by the Miller, who represents a lower class, it sets the stage for the ''Tales'' to reflect both a respect for and a disregard for upper class rules. Helen Cooper, as well as Mikhail Bakhtin and Derek Brewer, call this opposition \"the ordered and the grotesque, [[Lent]] and [[Carnival]], officially approved culture and its riotous, and high-spirited underside.\"<ref name=opp>Cooper, 19</ref> Several works of the time contained the same opposition.<ref name=opp/>\n\n===Relativism versus realism===\nChaucer's characters each express different\u2014sometimes vastly different\u2014views of reality, creating an atmosphere of [[Playspace|testing]], [[empathy]], and [[relativism]].<ref name=\"empathy article\" /> As [[Helen Cooper (professor)|Helen Cooper]] says, \"Different genres give different readings of the world: the [[fabliau]] scarcely notices the operations of God, the saint's life focuses on those at the expense of physical reality, tracts and sermons insist on prudential or orthodox morality, romances privilege human emotion.\" The sheer number of varying persons and stories renders the ''Tales'' as a set unable to arrive at any definite truth or reality.<ref>Cooper, 21.</ref>\n\n===Liminality===\nThe concept of [[liminality]] figures prominently within ''The Canterbury Tales''.<ref name=\"empathy article\" /> A liminal space, which can be both geographical as well as metaphorical or spiritual, is the transitional or transformational space between a \u201creal\u201d (secure, known, limited) world and an unknown or imaginary space of both risk and possibility.<ref>Bishop, Norma J. \"Liminal Space in Travellers\u2019 Tales: Historical and Fictional Passages (Folklore, Ritual, History).\u201d Order No. 8615152 The Pennsylvania State University, 1986. Ann Arbor: ProQuest. Web. 30 Sep. 2015.</ref> The notion of a pilgrimage is itself a liminal experience, because it centres on travel between destinations and because pilgrims undertake it hoping to become more holy in the process. Thus, the structure of ''The Canterbury Tales'' itself is liminal; it not only covers the distance between London and Canterbury, but the majority of the tales refer to places entirely outside the geography of the pilgrimage. Jean Jost summarises the function of liminality in ''The Canterbury Tales'',\n\n{{Quote\n|Both appropriately and ironically in this raucous and subversive liminal space, a ragtag assembly gather together and tell their equally unconventional tales. In this unruly place, the rules of tale telling are established, themselves to be both disordered and broken; here the tales of game and earnest, solas and sentence, will be set and interrupted. Here the sacred and profane adventure begins, but does not end. Here, the condition of peril is as prominent as that of protection. The act of pilgrimaging itself consists of moving from one urban space, through liminal rural space, to the next urban space with an ever fluctuating series of events and narratives punctuating those spaces. The goal of pilgrimage may well be a religious or spiritual space at its conclusion, and reflect a psychological progression of the spirit, in yet another kind of emotional space.<ref>Jost, Jean. \"Urban and Liminal Space in Chaucer's Knight's Tale: Perilous or Protective?\" Albrecht Classen, ed.

Print.</ref>}}\nLiminality is also evident in the individual tales. An obvious instance of this is the [[The Friar's Tale|Friar's Tale]] in which the yeoman devil is a liminal figure because of his transitory nature and function; it is his purpose to issue souls from their current existence to hell, an entirely different one.<ref>Bloomfield, Morton W. \"The 'Friar's Tale' as a Liminal Tale\".

Print.</ref>\n\n==Influence on literature==\nIt is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution that this work made to [[English literature]] was in popularising the literary use of the [[vernacular]] English, rather than French or [[Latin]]. English had, however, been used as a literary language for centuries before Chaucer's life, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries\u2014[[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], and [[the Pearl Poet]]\u2014also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was responsible for starting a trend rather than simply being part of it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Although Chaucer had a powerful influence in poetic and artistic terms, which can be seen in the great number of forgeries and mistaken attributions (such as ''[[The Floure and the Leafe]]'', which was translated by [[John Dryden]]), modern English spelling and orthography owe much more to the innovations made by the [[Court of Chancery]] in the decades during and after his lifetime.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Chaucer ellesmere.jpg|thumb|left|Chaucer as a Pilgrim from the [[Ellesmere manuscript]].]]\n[[File:Wife-of-Bath-ms.jpg|thumb|right|Opening prologue of [[The Wife of Bath's Tale]] from the Ellesmere Manuscript.]]\n\nWhile Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems (the ''[[Book of the Duchess]]'' is believed to have been written for [[John of Gaunt]] on the occasion of his wife's death in 1368), the intended audience of ''The Canterbury Tales'' is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a [[courtier]], leading some to believe that he was mainly a [[court poet]] who wrote exclusively for the nobility. He is referred to as a noble translator and poet by [[Eustache Deschamps]] and by his contemporary John Gower. It has been suggested that the poem was intended to be read aloud, which is probable as this was a common activity at the time. However, it also seems to have been intended for private reading as well, since Chaucer frequently refers to himself as the writer, rather than the speaker, of the work. Determining the intended audience directly from the text is even more difficult, since the audience is part of the story. This makes it difficult to tell when Chaucer is writing to the fictional pilgrim audience or the actual reader.<ref>Pearsall, 294\u201395.</ref>\n\nChaucer's works may have been distributed in some form during his lifetime in part or in whole. Scholars speculate that manuscripts were circulated among his friends, but likely remained unknown to most people until after his death. However, the speed with which copyists strove to write complete versions of his tale in manuscript form shows that Chaucer was a famous and respected poet in his own day. The Hengwrt and Ellesmere manuscripts are examples of the care taken to distribute the work. More manuscript copies of the poem exist than for any other poem of its day except ''[[The Prick of Conscience]]'', causing some scholars to give it the medieval equivalent of bestseller status. Even the most elegant of the illustrated manuscripts, however, is not nearly as highly decorated as the work of authors of more respectable works such as [[John Lydgate]]'s religious and historical literature.<ref>Pearsall, 295\u201397.</ref>\n\n===15th century===\nJohn Lydgate and [[Thomas Occleve]] were among the first critics of Chaucer's ''Tales'', praising the poet as the greatest English poet of all time and the first to show what the language was truly capable of poetically. This sentiment was universally agreed upon by later critics into the mid-15th century. Glosses included in ''The Canterbury Tales'' manuscripts of the time praised him highly for his skill with \"sentence\" and rhetoric, the two pillars by which medieval critics judged poetry. The most respected of the tales was at this time the Knight's, as it was full of both.<ref>Pearsall, 298\u2013302.</ref>\n\n==Literary additions and supplements==\nThe incompleteness of the ''Tales'' led several medieval authors to write additions and supplements to the tales to make them more complete. Some of the oldest existing manuscripts of the tales include new or modified tales, showing that even early on, such additions were being created. These emendations included various expansions of the ''Cook's Tale'', which Chaucer never finished, ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', ''[[The Tale of Gamelyn]]'', the ''[[Siege of Thebes (Lydgate)|Siege of Thebes]]'', and the ''[[Tale of Beryn]]''.<ref>Trigg, Stephanie, ''Congenial Souls: Reading Chaucer from Medieval to Postmodern'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2002, p. 86. {{ISBN|0-8166-3823-3}}.</ref>\n\nThe ''Tale of Beryn'', written by an anonymous author in the 15th century, is preceded by a lengthy prologue in which the pilgrims arrive at Canterbury and their activities there are described. While the rest of the pilgrims disperse throughout the town, the Pardoner seeks the affections of Kate the barmaid, but faces problems dealing with the man in her life and the innkeeper Harry Bailey. As the pilgrims turn back home, the Merchant restarts the storytelling with ''Tale of Beryn''. In this tale, a young man named Beryn travels from Rome to Egypt to seek his fortune only to be cheated by other businessmen there. He is then aided by a local man in getting his revenge. The tale comes from the French tale ''[[B\u00e9rinus]]'' and exists in a single early manuscript of the tales, although it was printed along with the tales in a 1721 edition by [[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry]].<ref>Trigg, pp. 86\u201388, 97.</ref>\n\nJohn Lydgate wrote ''The Siege of Thebes'' in about 1420. Like the ''Tale of Beryn'', it is preceded by a prologue in which the pilgrims arrive in Canterbury. Lydgate places himself among the pilgrims as one of them and describes how he was a part of Chaucer's trip and heard the stories. He characterises himself as a monk and tells a long story about the history of Thebes before the events of the ''Knight's Tale''. John Lydgate's tale was popular early on and exists in old manuscripts both on its own and as part of the ''Tales''. It was first printed as early as 1561 by [[John Stow]], and several editions for centuries after followed suit.<ref>Trigg, pp. 88\u201397.</ref>\n\nThere are actually two versions of ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', both of which are influenced by the story ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', a work written during Chaucer's lifetime. Chaucer describes a Plowman in the ''General Prologue'' of his tales, but never gives him his own tale. One tale, written by [[Thomas Occleve]], describes the miracle of the Virgin and the Sleeveless Garment. Another tale features a pelican and a griffin debating church corruption, with the pelican taking a position of protest akin to [[John Wycliffe]]'s ideas.<ref>Brewer, Charlotte, ''Editing Piers Plowman: The Evolution of the Text'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 8\u20139. {{ISBN|0-521-34250-3}}.</ref>\n\n''The Tale of Gamelyn'' was included in an early manuscript version of the tales, Harley 7334, which is notorious for being one of the lower-quality early manuscripts in terms of editor error and alteration. It is now widely rejected by scholars as an authentic Chaucerian tale, although some scholars think he may have intended to rewrite the story as a tale for the Yeoman. Dates for its authorship vary from 1340 to 1370.<ref>Ohlgren, Thomas, ''Medieval Outlaws'', Parlor Press, 2005, pp. 264\u201365. {{ISBN|1-932559-62-0}}.</ref>\n\n==Literary adaptations==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}\n\nMany literary works (both fiction and non-fiction alike) have used a similar frame narrative to ''The Canterbury Tales'' as an homage. Science-fiction writer [[Dan Simmons]] wrote his [[Hugo Award]] winning novel ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]'' based on an extra-planetary group of pilgrims. Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] used ''The Canterbury Tales'' as a structure for his 2004 non-fiction book about [[evolution]] titled ''[[The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution]]''. His animal pilgrims are on their way to find the common ancestor, each telling a tale about evolution.\n\n[[Henry Dudeney]]'s book ''[[The Canterbury Puzzles]]'' contains a part reputedly lost from what modern readers know as Chaucer's tales.\n\nHistorical-mystery novelist [[P.C. Doherty]] wrote a series of novels based on ''The Canterbury Tales'', making use of both the story frame and Chaucer's characters.\n\nCanadian author [[Angie Abdou]] translates ''The Canterbury Tales'' to a cross section of people, all snow-sports enthusiasts but from different social backgrounds, converging on a remote back-country ski cabin in British Columbia in the 2011 novel ''The Canterbury Trail''.\n\n==Adaptations and homages==\n''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'', by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, a retelling of \"The Knight's Tale\", was first performed in 1613 or 1614 and published in 1634. In 1961, [[Erik Chisholm]] completed his opera, ''The Canterbury Tales''. The opera is in three acts: The Wyf of Bath's Tale, The Pardoner's Tale and The Nun's Priest's Tale. [[Nevill Coghill]]'s modern English version formed the basis of a musical [[Canterbury Tales (musical)|version]] that was first staged in 1964.\n\n''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'', a 1944 film jointly written and directed by [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]], is loosely based on the narrative frame of Chaucer's tales. The movie opens with a group of medieval pilgrims journeying through the Kentish countryside as a narrator speaks the opening lines of the ''General Prologue''. The scene then makes a [[Match cut#Notable examples|now-famous transition]] to the time of World War II. From that point on, the film follows a group of strangers, each with his or her own story and in need of some kind of redemption, who are making their way to Canterbury together. The film's main story takes place in an imaginary town in Kent and ends with the main characters arriving at Canterbury Cathedral, bells pealing and Chaucer's words again resounding. ''A Canterbury Tale'' is recognised as one of the Powell-Pressburger team's most poetic and artful films. It was produced as wartime propaganda, using Chaucer's poetry, referring to the famous pilgrimage, and offering photography of Kent to remind the public of what made Britain worth fighting for. In one scene a local historian lectures an audience of British soldiers about the pilgrims of Chaucer's time and the vibrant history of England.<ref>Ellis, Steve, ''Chaucer at Large'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2000, pp. 64\u201365. {{ISBN|0-8166-3376-2}}.</ref>\n\n[[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s 1972 film ''[[The Canterbury Tales (film)|The Canterbury Tales]]'' features several of the tales, some of which keep close to the original tale and some of which are embellished. The ''Cook's Tale'', for instance, which is incomplete in the original version, is expanded into a full story, and the ''Friar's Tale'' extends the scene in which the Summoner is dragged down to hell. The film includes these two tales as well as the ''Miller's Tale'', the ''Summoner's Tale'', the ''Wife of Bath's Tale'', and the ''Merchant's Tale''.<ref>Pencak, William, ''The Films of Derek Jarman'', Jefferson: McFarland & Co, 2002, pp. 178\u20139. {{ISBN|0-7864-1430-8}}.</ref>\n\nOn 26 April 1986, American radio personality [[Garrison Keillor]] opened \"The News from Lake Wobegon\" portion of the first live TV broadcast of his ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' radio show with a reading of the original Middle English text of the General Prologue.  He commented, \"Although those words were written more than 600 years ago, they still describe spring.\"\n\nTelevision adaptations include [[Alan Plater]]'s 1975 re-telling of the stories in a series of plays for BBC2: ''[[Trinity Tales]]''. In 2003, the BBC again featured [[The Canterbury Tales (TV series)|modern re-tellings of selected tales]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/canterburytales/ |title=Canterbury Tales |accessdate=6 May 2007 |publisher=BBC Drama}}</ref>\n\n{{Panorama |image=File:Canterbury-west-Winter-Highsmith.jpeg |fullwidth=6900 |fullheight=825 |height=165 |caption= [[Ezra Winter]], ''Canterbury Tales'' mural (1939), [[Library of Congress]] [[John Adams Building]], Washington, D.C.

In most countries, it is a research degree that qualifies the holder to teach at university level in the degree's field, or to work in a specific [[profession]]. There are a number of doctoral degrees; the most common is the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD), which is awarded in many different fields, ranging from the [[humanities]] to [[science|scientific]] disciplines.\n\nIn the United States and some other countries, there are also some types of technical or [[professional degree]]s that include doctor in their name and are, in some of those countries, classified as doctorates. Professional doctorates historically came about to meet the needs of practitioners in a variety of disciplines. However, the necessity of these degrees may vary greatly across disciplines, making their significance unclear.\n\nMany universities also award [[honorary doctorate]]s to individuals deemed worthy of special recognition, either for scholarly work or for other contributions to the university or to society.\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe term ''doctor'' derives from Latin, meaning \"teacher\" or \"instructor\".

In most of [[Europe]], all fields ([[history]], philosophy, [[social sciences]], [[mathematics]], and [[natural philosophy]]/[[natural sciences]])<ref>Sooyoung Chang, ''Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians'', World Scientific, 2010, p. 183.</ref> were traditionally known as philosophy, and in [[Germany]] and elsewhere in Europe the basic faculty of [[liberal arts]] was known as the \"faculty of philosophy\". The doctorate of philosophy adheres to this historic convention, even though the degrees are not always for the study of philosophy. Chris Park explains that it was not until formal education and degree programs were standardized in the early 19th century that the doctorate of philosophy was reintroduced in Germany as a research degree,<ref name=\"Redefining the Doctorate\">Park, C.

Germany, however, differentiated then in more detail between doctorates in philosophy and doctorates in the natural sciences, abbreviated as [[Dr. rer. nat.]], and also doctorates in the social/political sciences, abbreviated as Dr. rer. pol., similar to the other traditional doctorates in medicine (Dr. med.) and law (Dr. jur.).\n\nUniversity doctoral training was a form of [[apprenticeship]] to a [[guild]]. The traditional term of study before new teachers were admitted to the guild of \"Masters of Arts\" was seven years, matching the apprenticeship term for other occupations. Originally the terms \"master\" and \"doctor\" were synonymous, but over time the doctorate came to be regarded as a higher qualification than the [[master's degree]].\n\nUniversity degrees, including doctorates, were originally restricted to men. The first women to be granted doctorates were [[Juliana Morell]] in 1608 at Lyons,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Juliana_Morell|title=Juliana Morell|encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopaedia|date=1913|access-date=2016-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018200827/https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Juliana_Morell|archive-date=2016-10-18|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Elena Cornaro Piscopia]] in 1678 at the [[University of Padua]], [[Laura Bassi]] in 1732 at [[Bologna University]], [[Dorothea Erxleben]] in 1754 at [[Halle University]] and  [[Mar\u00eda Isidra de Guzm\u00e1n y de la Cerda]] in 1785 at [[Complutense University]], Madrid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uah.es/universidad/presentacion/historia_universidad.shtm|title=Universidad de Alcal\u00e1|author=Universidad de Alcala (UAH), Madrid|work=uah.es|access-date=2012-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007070354/http://www.uah.es/universidad/presentacion/historia_universidad.shtm|archive-date=2012-10-07|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Modern times===\nThe use and meaning of the doctorate has changed over time, and is subject to regional variations. For instance, until the early 20th century few academic staff or professors in [[English (language)|English-speaking]] universities held doctorates, except for very senior scholars and those in [[Holy Orders|holy orders]]. After that time the [[Higher education in Germany|German practice]] of requiring lecturers to have completed a research doctorate spread. Universities' shift to research-oriented education (based upon the scientific method, inquiry, and observation) increased the doctorate's importance. Today, a research doctorate (PhD) or its equivalent (as defined in the US by the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]) is generally a prerequisite for an [[Academia|academic]] career, although many recipients do not work in academia.\n\nProfessional doctorates developed in the United States from the 19th century onward. The first professional doctorate to be offered in the United States was the [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] at Kings College (now [[Columbia University]]) after the medical school's founding in 1767,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/history.html|title=A Brief History of Columbia|work=columbia.edu|access-date=2016-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517080232/http://www.columbia.edu/content/history.html|archive-date=2016-05-17|url-status=live}}</ref> although this was not a professional doctorate in the modern American sense as it was awarded for further study after the qualifying Bachelor of Medicine (M.B.) rather than being a qualifying degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps.columbia.edu/about-ps/history-college-physicians-and-surgeons|title=History of the College of Physicians and Surgeons|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=7 October 2016|quote=King's College organized a medical faculty in 1767 and was the first institution in the North American Colonies to confer the degree of Doctor of Medicine.

However it took a long time to be accepted, not replacing the Bachelor of Laws (LLB) until the 1960s, by which time the LLB was generally taken as a graduate degree. Notably, the curriculum for the JD and LLB were identical, with the degree being renamed as a doctorate, and it (like the MD) was not equivalent to the PhD, raising criticism that it was \"not a 'true Doctorate{{'\"}}.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOyVvAPtTcwC&pg=PA20|pages=20\u201325|title=Comparing American and British Legal Education Systems: Lessons for Commonwealth African Law Schools|publisher=Cambria Press|date=2007|author=Kenneth K.

These doctorates are less common than the PhD in some countries and are often awarded ''[[honoris causa]]''. The [[habilitation]] is still used for academic recruitment purposes in many countries within the EU, and involves either a new long thesis (a second book) or a portfolio of research publications. The habilitation (highest available degree) demonstrates independent and thorough research, experience in teaching and lecturing, and, more recently, the ability to generate supportive funding. The habilitation follows the research doctorate, and in Germany it can be a requirement for appointment as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' or professor.\n\n==Types==\n{{further|Doctor (title)}}\nSince the [[Middle Ages]], the number and types of doctorates awarded by universities has proliferated throughout the world.

The doctor's degree classification encompasses three main subcategories\u2014research/scholarship degrees, professional practice degrees, and other degrees\u2014which are described below.<br />Doctor's degree-research/scholarship: A Ph.D. or other doctor's degree that requires advanced work beyond the master's level, including the preparation and defense of a dissertation based on original research, or the planning and execution of an original project demonstrating substantial artistic or scholarly achievement. Examples of this type of degree may include the following and others, as designated by the awarding institution: the Ed.D. (in education), D.M.A. (in musical arts), D.B.A. (in business administration), D.Sc. (in science), D.A. (in arts), or D.M (in medicine).<br />Doctor's degree\u2014professional practice: A doctor's degree that is conferred upon completion of a program providing the knowledge and skills for the recognition, credential, or license required for professional practice. The degree is awarded after a period of study such that the total time to the degree, including both preprofessional and professional preparation, equals at least 6 full-time-equivalent academic years. Some doctor's degrees of this type were formerly classified as first-professional degrees. Examples of this type of degree may include the following and others, as designated by the awarding institution: the D.C. or D.C.M. (in chiropractic); D.D.S. or D.M.D. (in dentistry); L.L.B. or J.D.

After completion, which normally consumes 4 years, the candidate is commonly awarded the degree of ''Doutor'' (Doctor) followed by the main area of specialization, e.g. ''Doutor em Direito'' (Doctor of Laws), ''Doutor em Ci\u00eancias da Computa\u00e7\u00e3o'' (Doctor of Computer Sciences), ''Doutor em Filosofia'' (Doctor of Philosophy), ''Doutor em Economia'' (Doctor of Economics), ''Doutor em Engenharia'' (Doctor of Engineering) or ''Doutor em Medicina'' (Doctor of Medicine). The generic title of ''Doutor em Ci\u00eancias'' (Doctor of Sciences) is normally used to refer collectively to doctorates in the natural sciences (i.e. Physics, Chemistry, Biological and Life Sciences, etc.)\n\nAll graduate programs in Brazilian public universities are tuition-free (mandated by the [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian constitution]]). Some graduate students are additionally supported by institutional scholarships granted by federal government agencies like CNPq (''Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico'') and CAPES (''Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento do Pessoal de Ensino Superior''). Personal scholarships are provided by the various FAP's (''Funda\u00e7\u00f5es de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa'') at the state level, especially FAPESP in the state of [[S\u00e3o Paulo state|S\u00e3o Paulo]], FAPERJ in the state of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and FAPEMIG in the state of [[Minas Gerais]]. Competition for graduate financial aid is intense and most scholarships support at most 2 years of Master's studies and 4 years of doctoral studies. The normal monthly stipend for doctoral students in Brazil is between US$500 and $1000.\n\nA degree of ''Doutor'' usually enables an individual to apply for a junior faculty position equivalent to a US [[assistant professor]]. Progression to full professorship, known as ''Professor Titular'' requires that the candidate be successful in a competitive public exam and normally takes additional years. In the federal university system, doctors who are admitted as junior faculty members may progress (usually by seniority) to the rank of associate professor, then become eligible to take the competitive exam for vacant full professorships. In S\u00e3o Paulo state universities, associate professorships and subsequent eligibility to apply for a full professorship are conditioned on the qualification of [[:pt:Livre-doc\u00eancia|Livre-docente]] and requires, in addition to a doctorate, a second thesis or cumulative portfolio of peer-reviewed publications, a public lecture before a panel of experts (including external members from other universities), and a written exam.\n\nIn recent years some initiatives as jointly supervised doctorates (e.g. \"cotutelles\") have become increasingly common in the country, as part of the country's efforts to open its universities to international students.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Olavo Leite|first1=Andr\u00e9|last2=Carmo|first2=Valter Moura|title=Os doutorados em cotutela no Brasil e em seus principais parceiros acad\u00eamicos|journal=Revista Brasileira de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o|date=2014|volume=11|issue=26|pages=969\u2013997|url=http://ojs.rbpg.capes.gov.br/index.php/rbpg/article/view/560|access-date=2015-05-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522063228/http://ojs.rbpg.capes.gov.br/index.php/rbpg/article/view/560|archive-date=2015-05-22|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\n[[Denmark]] offers four levels of degrees: 1) a three-year bachelor's degree (e.g. Bachelor of Arts degree); 2) a five-year candidate's degree (e.g. ''Candidatus/Candidata Magisterii''), generally compared to a master's degree; 3) a ph.d.<!-- \"ph.d.\" is the correct spelling of this Danish degree. It should not be confused with the English Ph.D. --> degree, which replaced the [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in 1988; 4) a doctor's degree (e.g. ''Doctor Philosophiae''), which is the higher doctorate. (A three-year extended research program, leading to the magister's degree was phased out to meet the international standards of the [[Bologna Process]].)\n\nFor the Ph.D. degree, the candidate writes a thesis and defends it orally at a formal [[disputation]]. In the disputation, the candidate defends their thesis against three official opponents as well as opponents from the [[auditorium]] ''(ex auditorio)''.\n\nFor the higher doctorate, the candidate writes a major thesis and has to defend it orally in which the candidate (called ''pr\u00e6ses'') defends this thesis against two official opponents as well as opponents from the auditorium (''ex auditorio'').\n\n===Egypt===\nIn Egypt, the highest degree doctorate is awarded by [[Al-Azhar University]] est. 970, which grants ( \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0100limiyya\\ [[Habilitation]]).\n\nThe Medical doctorate (abbreviated as M.D.) is equivalent to the [[Ph.D.]] degree.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180413220705/http://www.seci.info/staff23.htm ]</ref> To earn an M.D. in a science specialty, one must have a master's degree (M.Sc.) (or two diplomas before the introduction of M.Sc. degree in Egypt) before applying. The M.D. degree involves courses in the field and defending a dissertation. It takes on average three to five years.\n\nMany postgraduate medical and surgical specialties students earn a doctorate. After finishing a 6-year medical school and one-year internship (house officer), physicians and surgeons earn the M.B. B.Ch. degree, which is equivalent to a US [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree. They can then apply to earn a master's degree or a speciality diploma, then an MD degree in a specialty.\n\nThe Egyptian M.D. degree is written using the name of one's specialty. For example, M.D. (Geriatrics) means a doctorate in [[Geriatrics]], which is equivalent to a Ph.D. in Geriatrics.<!--\\\nAcademic sciences like Microbiology earn a Ph.D. degree.-->\n\n===Finland===\nThe Finnish requirement for the entrance into doctoral studies is a master's degree or equivalent.

The requirement was removed in 2005, leaving the decision to individual universities, which may delegate the authority to faculties or individual professors. In Engineering and Science, required coursework varies between 40 and 70 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]].\n\nThe duration of graduate studies varies. It is possible to graduate three years after the master's degree, while much longer periods are not uncommon. The study ends with a dissertation, which must present substantial new scientific/scholarly knowledge. The dissertation can either be a monograph or it an edited collection of 3 to 7 journal articles. Students unable or unwilling to write a dissertation may qualify for a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] degree by completing the coursework requirement and writing a shorter thesis, usually summarizing one year of research.\n\nWhen the dissertation is ready, the faculty names two expert pre-examiners with doctoral degrees from the outside the university. During the pre-examination process, the student may receive comments on the work and respond with modifications.<ref>{{in lang|fi}} [https://archive.today/20120530044420/https://oa.doria.fi/handle/10024/42487 Peura, A (2004) Tohtoriksi tulemisen tarina].

The opponent and the candidate conduct a formal debate, usually wearing [[white tie]], under the supervision of the thesis supervisor. Family, friends, colleagues and the members of the research community customarily attend the defence. After a formal entrance, the candidate begins with an approximately 20-minute popular lecture (''lectio praecursoria''), that is meant to introduce laymen to the thesis topic. The opponent follows with a short talk on the topic, after which the pair critically discuss the dissertation. The proceedings take two to three hours. At the end the opponent presents their final statement and reveals whether he/she will recommend that the faculty accept it. Any member of the public then has an opportunity to raise questions, although this is rare. Immediately after the defence, the supervisor, the opponent and the candidate drink coffee with the public.

Exceptions may be granted by the university governing board, but this is uncommon, and usually due to other work and expertise considered equivalent.\n\n===France<!--'Doctorat', 'Doctorat d'universit\u00e9', 'Doctorat de troisi\u00e8me cycle', and 'Doctorat de sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9' redirect here-->===\n;History\nBefore 1984 three research doctorates existed in France: the [[State doctorate]] (''doctorat d'\u00c9tat'', \"DrE\", the old doctorate introduced in 1808), the third cycle doctorate (''Doctorat de troisi\u00e8me cycle'', also called doctorate of specialty, ''Doctorat de sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9'', created in 1954 and shorter than the State doctorate) and the [[diploma]] of doctor-engineer (''dipl\u00f4me de docteur-ing\u00e9nieur'' created in 1923), for technical research.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, following the submission of two theses (primary thesis, ''th\u00e8se principale'', and secondary thesis, ''th\u00e8se compl\u00e9mentaire'') to the Faculty of Letters (in France, \"letters\" is equivalent to \"[[humanities]]\") at the [[University of Paris]], the doctoral candidate was awarded the ''[[Doctorat \u00e8s lettres]]''. There was also the less prestigious \"university doctorate\" ''Doctorat d'universit\u00e9'' which could be received for the submission of a single thesis.\n\nIn the 1950s, the ''Doctorat \u00e8s lettres'' was renamed to ''Doctorat d'\u00c9tat''.<ref name=\"Schrift p. 208\">Alan D. Schrift (2006), ''Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes And Thinkers'', Blackwell Publishing, p. 208.</ref> In 1954 (for the [[Natural science|sciences]]) and 1958 (for letters and [[human sciences]]), the less demanding ''Doctorat de troisi\u00e8me cycle'' degree was created on the model of the American [[Ph.D.]] with the purpose to lessen what had become an increasingly long period of time between the typical students' completion of their Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures, roughly equivalent to a [[Master of Arts]]) and their ''Doctorat d'\u00c9tat''.<ref name=\"Schrift p. 208\"/>\n\nAfter 1984, only one type of doctoral degree remained: the \"doctorate\" (''Doctorat''). A special diploma was created called the \"accreditation to supervise research\" (''Habilitation \u00e0 diriger des recherches''), a professional qualification to supervise doctoral work. (This diploma is similar in spirit to the older State doctorate, and the requirements for obtaining it are similar to those necessary to obtain [[tenure]] in other systems.) Before only professors or senior full researchers of similar rank were normally authorized to supervise a doctoral candidate's work.<ref>H. D. Lewis, ''The French Education System'', Routledge, 1985, {{ISBN|0-7099-1683-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7099-1683-3}}</ref> Now habilitation is a prerequisite to the title of professor in university (''Professeur des universit\u00e9s'') and to the title of Research Director (''Directeur de recherche'') in national public research agency such as [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|CNRS]], [[Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique|INRIA]], or [[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique|INRAE]].\n\n;Admission\nToday, the doctorate (''doctorat'') is a research-only degree. It is a national degree and its requirements are fixed by the minister of higher education and research. Only public institutions award the doctorate. It can be awarded in any field of study. The [[Master's degree in Europe|master's degree]] is a prerequisite. The normal duration is three years. The [[redaction]] of a comprehensive thesis constitutes the bulk of the doctoral work. While the length of the thesis varies according to the discipline, it is rarely less than 150 pages, and often substantially more. Some 15,000 new doctoral matriculations occur every year and ~10,000 doctorates are awarded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid20185/doctorat.html |title=La formation doctorale \u2013 ESR |website=Enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202110630/http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid20185/doctorat.html |archive-date=2016-12-02 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDoctoral candidates can apply for a three-year fellowship. The most well known is the ''Contrat Doctoral'' (4,000 granted every year with a gross salary of 1758 euros per months {{as of|2016|September|lc=y}}).\n\nSince 2002 candidates follow in-service training, but there is no written examination for the doctorate. The candidate has to write a thesis that is read by two external reviewers. The head of the institution decides whether the candidate can defend the thesis, after considering the external reviews. The jury members are designated by the head of the institution. The candidate's supervisor and the external reviewers are generally jury members. The maximum number of jury members is 8. The defense generally lasts 45 minutes in scientific fields, followed by 1 \u2013 2 and a half hours of questions from the jury or other doctors present. The defense and questions are public. The jury then deliberates in private and then declares the candidate admitted or \"postponed\". The latter is rare. New regulations were set in 2016 and do not award distinctions.\n\nThe title of doctor (''docteur'') can also be used by medical and pharmaceutical practitioners who hold a doctor's State diploma (''dipl\u00f4me d'\u00c9tat de docteur''). The diploma is a first-degree.\n\n===Germany<!--'Promotion (Germany)' and 'Inaugural thesis' redirect here-->===\nDoctoral degrees in Germany are research doctorates and are awarded by a process called '''''Promotion'''''<!--italics per MOS:Ety; boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (\"promotion\"). The concept of a US-style [[professional doctorate]] as an entry-level professional qualification does not exist. However, in medicine, \"doctoral\" dissertations are often written alongside undergraduate study.

Most doctorates are awarded with specific Latin designations for the field of research (except for engineering, where the designation is German), instead of a general name for all fields (such as the [[Ph.D.]]). The most important degrees are:\n* ''[[Dr. rer. nat.]]'' (''rerum naturalium''; [[Natural science|natural]] and [[Formal science|formal]] sciences, i.e. physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, computer science and information technology, or psychology);\n* ''Dr. phil.'' (''philosophiae''; humanities such as philosophy, philology, history, and social sciences such as sociology, political science, or psychology as well);\n* ''Dr. iur.'' (''iuris''; law);\n* ''Dr. oec.'' (''oeconomiae''; economics);\n* ''Dr. rer. pol.'' (''rerum politicarum''; economics, business administration, political science);\n* ''Dr. theol.'' (''theologiae''; theology);\n* ''Dr. med.'' (''medicinae''; medicine);\n* ''Dr. med. dent.'' (''medicinae dentariae''; dentistry);\n* ''Dr. med. vet.'' (''medicinae veterinariae''; veterinary medicine);\n* ''[[Doktoringenieur|Dr.-Ing.]]'' (engineering).\n\nOver fifty such designations exist, many of them rare or no longer in use. As a title, the degree is commonly written in front of the name in abbreviated form, e.g., ''Dr. rer. nat. Max Mustermann'' or ''Dr. Max Mustermann'', dropping the designation entirely. However, leaving out the designation is only allowed when the doctorate degree is not an honorary doctorate, which must be indicated by ''Dr. h.c.'' (from Latin honoris causa). Although the honorific does not become part of the name, holders can demand that the title appear in official documents. The title is not mandatory. The honorific is commonly used in formal letters. For holders of other titles, only the highest title is mentioned. Multiple holders of doctorate degrees can be addressed as ''Dres.'' (from Latin ''doctores''). Professional doctorates obtained in other countries, not requiring a thesis or not being third cycle qualifications under the Bologna process, can only be used postnominally, e.g., \"Max Mustermann, MD\", and do not allow the use of the title Dr.<ref>{{cite web| title = F\u00fchrung ausl\u00e4ndischer Hochschulgrade| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090411040259/http://www.kmk.org/wissenschaft-hochschule/internationale-hochschulangelegenheiten/fuehrung-auslaendischer-hochschulgrade.html| archive-date = 11 April 2009| url = http://www.kmk.org/wissenschaft-hochschule/internationale-hochschulangelegenheiten/fuehrung-auslaendischer-hochschulgrade.html| url-status = dead}}</ref> In contrast to English, in which a person's name is preceded by at most one title (except in very ceremonious usage), the formal German mode of address permits several titles in addition to \"Herr\" or \"Frau\" (which, unlike \"Mr\" or \"Ms\", is not considered a title at all, but an ''Anrede'' or \"address\"), including repetitions in the case of multiple degrees, as in \"Frau Prof. Dr. Dr. Schmidt\",<ref>{{cite web| title=Duden: Professorinnen und Professoren anschreiben oder anreden | url=https://www.duden.de/sprachwissen/sprachratgeber/Professorinnen-und-Professoren-anschreiben-oder-anreden}}</ref> for a person who would be addressed as \"Prof. Schmidt\" in English.\n\nIn the German university system it is common to write two doctoral theses, the inaugural thesis ('''''Inauguraldissertation''''')<!--italics per MOS:Ety; boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, completing a course of study, and the [[habilitation]] thesis (''[[Habilitationsschrift]]''), which opens the road to a professorship.<ref>Carl Brockelmann, ''History of the Arabic Written Tradition'', Volume 1, BRILL, 2016, p. vii.</ref> Upon completion of the habilitation thesis, a ''Habilitation'' is awarded, which is indicated by appending ''habil.'' (''habilitata/habilitatus'') to the doctorate, e.g., ''Dr. rer. nat. habil. Max Mustermann''. It is considered as an additional academic qualification rather than an academic degree formally. It qualifies the owner to teach at German universities (''facultas docendi''). The holder of a ''Habilitation'' receives the authorization to teach a certain subject (''venia legendi''). This has been the traditional prerequisite for attaining [[Privatdozent|''Privatdozent'' (PD)]] and employment as a full university [[professor]]. With the introduction of ''Juniorprofessuren''\u2014around 2005\u2014as an alternative track towards becoming a professor at universities (with tenure), ''Habilitation'' is no longer the only university career track.\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], doctorates are offered by universities. Entry requirements include master's degree. Some universities consider undergraduate degrees in professional areas such as engineering, medicine or law as qualifications for pursuing doctorate level degrees. Entrance examinations are held for almost all programs. In most universities, coursework duration and thesis is 5\u20136 years. The most common doctoral degree is Ph.D.\n\n===Italy===\nItaly uses a three-level degree system. The first-level degree, called a \"[[laurea]]\" (''Bachelor's degree''), requires three years and a short thesis. The second-level degree, called a \"[[Laurea|laurea magistrale]]\" (''Master's degree''), is obtained after two additional years, specializing in a branch of the field. This degree requires more advanced thesis work, usually involving academic research or an internship. The final degree is called a \"[[Laurea|dottorato di ricerca]]\" (''Ph.D.'') and is obtained after three years of academic research on the subject and a thesis.\n\nAlternatively, after obtaining the ''laurea'' or the ''laurea magistrale'' one can complete a \"Master's\" (first-level Master's after the ''laurea''; second-level Master's after the ''laurea magistrale'') of one or two years, usually including an internship. An Italian \"Master's\" is not the same as a master's degree; it is intended to be more focused on professional training and practical experience.\n\nRegardless of the field of study, the title for Bachelors Graduate students is ''[[Dottore]]/Dottoressa'' (abbrev. ''Dott.''/''Dott.ssa'', or as ''Dr.''), not to be confused with the title for the Ph.D., which is instead ''Dottore/Dottoressa di Ricerca''. A ''laurea magistrale'' grants instead the title of ''Dottore/Dottoressa magistrale''. Graduates in the fields of Education, Art and Music are also called ''Dr. Prof.'' (or simply ''Professore'') or ''Maestro''.

These degrees were awarded by the employees' former university, usually after years of research in industrial laboratories. The only requirement is submission of a dissertation, along with articles published in well-known journals. This program is called {{nihongo|''ronbun hakase''|\u8ad6\u6587\u535a\u58eb}}. It produced the majority of engineering doctoral degrees from national universities. University-based doctoral programs called {{nihongo|''katei hakase''|\u8ab2\u7a0b\u535a\u58eb}}, are gradually replacing these degrees. By 1994, more doctoral engineering degrees were earned for research within university laboratories (53%) than industrial research laboratories (47%).<ref>[https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf97324/chp4.htm The Science and Technology Resources of Japan: A Comparison with the United States] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305013537/http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf97324/chp4.htm |date=2016-03-05 }} Nsf.gov (2004-11-10).

European Network on Law and Society.</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Flanders===\nThe traditional academic system of the [[Netherlands]] provided basic academic diploma: ''propaedeuse'' and three academic degrees: ''kandidaat'' (the lowest degree), depending on gender ''doctorandus'' or ''doctoranda'' (drs.) (with equivalent degrees in engineering \u2013 ir. and law \u2013 mr.) and ''doctor'' (dr.). After successful completion of the first year of university, the student was awarded the propaedeutic diploma (not a degree). In some fields, this diploma was abolished in the 1980s. In physics and mathematics, the student could directly obtain a ''kandidaats (candidate)'' diploma in two years. The candidate diploma was all but abolished by 1989. It used to be attained after completion of the majority of courses of the academic study (usually after completion of course requirements of the third year in the program), after which the student was allowed to begin work on their doctorandus thesis. The successful completion of this thesis conveyed the ''[[doctorandus|doctoranda/us]]'' title, implying that the student's initial studies were finished. In addition to these 'general' degrees, specific titles equivalent to the ''doctorandus'' degree were awarded for law: ''meester'' (master) (mr.), and for engineering: ''ingenieur'' (engineer)(ir.). Following the Bologna protocol the Dutch adopted the Anglo-Saxon system of academic degrees. The old candidate's degree was revived to become the bachelor's degree and the doctorandus' (mr and ir degree) were replaced by master's degrees. Dutch university programmes tend to include advanced subject matter that e.g., at Harvard is taught in Ph.D.-courses (for instance advanced [[quantum mechanics]] or [[general relativity]] in a Dutch course for the master's degree in [[theoretical physics]]).\n\nStudents can only enroll in a doctorate system after completing a research university level master's degree; although dispensation can be granted on a case by case basis after scrutiny of the individual's portfolio. The most common way to conduct doctoral studies is to work as ''promovendus''/''assistant in opleiding'' (aio)/''onderzoeker in opleiding'' (oio) ([[research assistant]] with additional courses and supervision), perform extensive research and write a dissertation consisting of published articles (over a period of four or more years, averaging about 5.5 to 6). Research can also be conducted without official research assistant status, for example through a business-sponsored research laboratory.\n\nEvery Ph.D. thesis has to be promoted by a full university professor who has the role of principal advisor. The promotor (professor) determines whether the thesis quality suffices and can be submitted to the committee of experts. A committee of experts in the field review the thesis. Failures at this stage are rare because supervisors withhold inadequate work. The supervisors and promotor lose prestige among their colleagues should they allow a substandard thesis to be submitted.\n\nAfter reviewer approval, the candidate publishes the thesis (generally more than 100 copies) and sends it to colleagues, friends and family with an invitation to the public defense. The degree is awarded in a formal, public, defense session, in which the thesis is defended against critical questions of the \"opposition\" (the review committee). Failure during this session is possible, but rare. Before the defense there may or may not be a public presentation, lasting 10 minutes (e.g. Eindhoven University) to exactly half hour (e.g. Delft University). The actual defense lasts exactly the assigned time slot (45 minutes to 1 hour exactly depending on the university) after which the defense is stopped by the [[bedel]] who closes the process.\n\nThe doctor's title is the highest academic degree in the Netherlands. In research doctorates the degree is always Ph.D. with no distinction between disciplines. Three Dutch universities of technology ([[Eindhoven University of Technology]], [[Delft University of Technology]], and [[University of Twente]]) also award a (lower ranked) [[Professional Doctorate in Engineering]] ([[Professional Doctorate in Engineering|PDEng]]).\n\nAlthough the title doctor is informally called Ph.D., legally no Ph.D. degree exists. All other university titles (B.Sc./B.Ba./LL.B./B.A. M.Sc./M.B.A./LL.M./M.A.) are protected by law, while Ph.D. is not. Any person thus can adopt the Ph.D. title, but not the doctor title, which is protected. Those who obtained a degree in a foreign country can only use the Dutch title drs. mr. ir. or dr. if approved by the ''Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ib-groep.nl/international_visitors/Diploma_assessment/Coming_to_the_Netherlands/s20_an_academic_title.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217152308/http://ib-groep.nl/international_visitors/Diploma_assessment/Coming_to_the_Netherlands/s20_an_academic_title.asp |archivedate=2010-12-17 }}</ref> though according to the [[opportunity principle]], little effort monitors such frauds.

Doctorandus is still used as a synonym for a Ph.D. student. The ''licentiaat'' (licensee) title was in use for a regular graduate until the Bologna reform changed the licentiaat degree to the master's degree (the Bologna reform abolished the two-year kandidaat degree and introduced a three-year academic bachelor's degree instead).\n<!---\n===Nepal===\nIn Nepal, doctorate level degrees are offered by the universities or institutions of national level importance deemed to be universities. Entry requirements for doctorates by most of the universities include good academic background at masters level (post graduate degree). Some universities also consider undergraduate degrees in professional areas such as engineering, medicine or law for entrance to doctorate level degrees. Entrance examinations are held for almost all the universities for admission to doctoral level degrees. The duration of the coursework and thesis for award of the degree is 2 \u2013 3 years after Ph.D. registration.\n---->\n<!---\n===Pakistan===\nResearch Degrees are Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy) awarded after extensive research work including a compulsory one year of course work and written examination. To get admission in Ph.D. you must be admitted to the MPhil program for which you need to pass NTS or GRE (subjective or General) and should have good grades throughout your career. Exemption from MPhil is possible if you have MS from a reputable University.\n---->\n<!---\n===Poland===\nThe Polish system is similar to the one adopted in Germany, with Ph.D. as a first level doctorate and [[habilitation]] (''habilitacja'') as second. The award of the title of ''doktor'' (Ph.D.) is usually preceded by 4\u20135 years of doctoral study (a post-graduate study offered at most universities, during which candidate is employed by this university and is usually obligated to teach some classes) and a doctoral exam. Doctoral studies usually consist of seminars, lectures, research and teaching. In order to become a ''doktor habilitowany'' (i.e. to be awarded a second level doctorate) a candidate has to publish a dissertation that is the culmination of several years of deep field studies, as well as have a recognized research record. While, according to current Polish law, candidates without [[habilitation]] are theoretically eligible to become professors, in practice it is extremely rare. Since 1993 only Master-degree holders are allowed to become a doctor, while prior to that time it was possible (but rare) to gain doctorate without Master studies (for example [[Stefan Banach]]).\n\nFirst, a prospective doctor must have published some works (articles, books). To become a doctor one needs to go through the process called doctoral proceedings (''przew\u00f3d doktorski''). This proceedings include the writing of a [[dissertation]] (varying in length), which then must be accepted by a panel of professors during a so-called ''defence of the dissertation'' (''obrona pracy doktorskiej''). There are several other requirements, like passing an exam in a foreign language and subject related to the dissertation title.\n\nThe title of a first level doctor is abbreviated as ''dr'' (without a full stop) before the surname of a person, e.g. ''dr Kowalski'' and a second level ''dr hab.''. After becoming a doctor ''mgr'' is omitted, e.g. ''mgr'' \u2192 ''dr'', ''mgr in\u017c.'' \u2192 ''dr in\u017c.''.\n\n''Doktor'' is also a common form of addressing a physician, but that does not indicate that the person actually holds a doctoral degree. Doctors of medicine have the abbreviation ''dr n. med.'' (doctor of medical science) before or after their surname.\n\nOther specific doctoral titles include ''dr n.t.'' (doctor of engineering) and ''dr n. farm'' (doctor of pharmaceutical science). ''Dr n.hum.'' means doctor of humanities (incl. psychology and sociology), but is rarely used to differentiate from doctors of other fields. All other doctorates have no indications of their field.\n---->\n<!---\n===Portugal===\n*Doutor (Doctor)\nAll doctoral programs are of research nature. Usually 3 or 4 years of study are required, mostly as a period of research. The student must write their thesis presenting a new discovery or original contribution to the field. If approved by his/her supervisor, the study will be presented to a panel of distinguished scholars. If approved, he or she will receive the doctorate.\n*Male title: \"Dr.\" and \"Doutor\". Female title: \"Dra.\" and \"Doutora\".\nIn Portugal it is common to use the title \"Dr.\" (supposedly the abbreviation of \"Doutor\") in reference to people with \"Licenciatura\" or \"Mestrado\" degrees.\nThus \"Doutor\" is commonly used in the extended form to denote someone with a doctorate. \"Professor Doutor\" is usually used for university professors.\n\nBefore the [[Bologna process|Bologna Process]] reform, a \"Licenciatura\" was something between a Bachelor (\"Bacharelato\" in Portugal) and it represented 4 to 6 years of graduate studies.\n\nAfter the [[Bologna process|Bologna Process]] reform in Portugal, the new \"Licenciatura\" degree is equivalent to the old \"Bacharelato\" (Bachelor with 3 or 4 years). There are also the \"Mestrado\" (Master's degree) and the \"Mestrado Integrado\" (integrated bachelor's and master's degree with 5 or 6 years, required for access to some professional fields).\nSome professionals have, however, different titles. For example: \"Eng.\" (Engenheiro, such as the Master of Engineering), \"Arq.\" (Arquitecto, Architect). The term \"Dr.\" in Portugal is also used for people from other professional fields. For Example, Dentists, Lawyers and Physicians.\n---->\n<!---\n===Russia===\nMany post-Soviet countries, including [[Russian Federation]], have a two-stage path to obtain research degrees, generally similar to the doctorate system in Europe. The first stage is named ''\"[[Kandidat]](\u041a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a) of <...> Sciences\"'' (the literal translation means \"Candidate of Sciences\",) (for instance, [[Kandidat]] of Medical Sciences, of Chemical Sciences, of Philological Sciences etc.). The Kandidat of Sciences degree is usually recognised as an equivalent of the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree and requires at least (and typically more than) three, four or five years of post-graduate research which is finished by defence of [[Dissertation]] or rarely\u2014[[thesis]]. Additionally, a seeker of the degree has to pass three examinations (a so-called \"Kandidate's minimum\"): in his/her special field, in a foreign language, and in the history and philosophy of science, which originates from the course of [[Communist Ideology]] named similar in Soviet times. After additional certification by the corresponding experts, the Kandidat degree may be recognized internationally as an equivalent of the Ph.D. (An unconditional Ph.D. equivalence has been recognized before the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], and the additional certification in many countries has become a requirement following the steep increased flow of post-Soviet emigration.) The second stage, [[Doktor nauk]], ''\"Doctor of <...> Sciences\"'', requires many years of research experience, and writing of a second dissertation. Obtaining [[Doktor nauk]] degree is usually associated with approval for a professorial position in Russian universities, while holders of [[Kandidat]] degree are rarely allowed to hold this administrative post. The degrees of Kandidat and Doktor of Sciences are only awarded by the special governmental agency ([[Higher Attestation Commission]]); only the university or scientific institute where the thesis was defended can recommend the award of this degree to candidates.\n---->\n\n===Russia===\nIn the [[Russian Empire]] the academic degree \"doctor of the sciences\" (''[[doktor nauk]]'') marked the highest academic degree that can be achieved by an examination. (The \"doctor nauk\" degree was introduced in Russia in 1819, abolished in 1917, and revived in the [[USSR]] in 1934.)<ref>Leitenberg, Milton and Raymond A. Zilinskas (2012), ''The Soviet Biological Weapons Program: A History'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2012, Table 2.1.</ref> This system was generally adopted by the [[USSR]]/[[Russia]] and many post-Soviet countries. A lower degree, \"[[Candidate of Sciences|candidate [doctor] of the sciences]]\" (''kandidat nauk''; first introduced in the USSR on January 13, 1934, by a decision of the [[Sovnarkom|Council of People's Commissars of the USSR]]), is, roughly, the Russian equivalent to the research doctorate in other countries.\n\n===Spain===\n[[File:Birrete doctoral.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The ancient ceremony of bestowing [[Complutense]]'s Doctoral ''[[biretta]]''.]]\nDoctoral degrees are regulated by Royal Decree (R.D. 778/1998),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upm.es/laupm/organos_gobierno/normativa/NormativaDoctorado0203.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216045313/http://www.upm.es/laupm/organos_gobierno/normativa/NormativaDoctorado0203.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-16 }}</ref> ''Real Decreto'' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).

A minimum of 4 years of study is required, divided into 2 stages:\n\n* A 2-year (or longer) period of studies concludes with a public dissertation presented to a panel of 3 Professors. Upon approval from the university, the candidate receives a \"Diploma de Estudios Avanzados\" (part qualified doctor, equivalent to M.Sc.). From 2008 it is possible to substitute the former diploma by a recognized master program.\n* A 2-year (or longer) research period includes extensions for up to 10 years. The student must present a thesis describing a discovery or original contribution. If approved by their thesis director, the study is presented to a panel of 5 distinguished scholars. Any Doctor attending the public defense is allowed to challenge the candidate with questions. If approved, the candidate receives the doctorate. Four marks used to be granted: Unsatisfactory (''Suspenso''), Pass (''Aprobado''), Remarkable (''Notable''), \"Cum laude\" (''Sobresaliente''), and \"Summa cum laude\" (''Sobresaliente Cum Laude''). Those Doctors granted their degree \"Summa Cum Laude\" were allowed to apply for an \"Extraordinary Award\".\n\nSince September 2012 and regulated by Royal Decree (R.D. 99/2011) (in Spanish),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2011/02/10/pdfs/BOE-A-2011-2541.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609114041/http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2011/02/10/pdfs/BOE-A-2011-2541.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-09 }}</ref> three marks can be granted: Unsatisfactory (''No apto''), Pass (''Apto'') and \"Cum laude\" (''Apto Cum Laude'') as maximum mark. In the public defense the doctor is notified if the thesis has passed or not passed. The ''Apto Cum Laude'' mark is awarded after the public defense as the result of a private, anonymous vote.

While the master/apprentice model was traditionally used for British PhDs, since 2003 courses have become more structured, with students taking courses in research skills and receiving training for professional and personal development. However, the assessment of the PhD remains based on the production of a thesis or equivalent and its defence at a ''[[oral exam|viva voce]]'' oral examination, normally held in front of at least two examiners, one internal and one external.<ref name=\"QAA Doctorate\"/> Access to PhDs normally requires an [[British degree classification|upper second class or first class]] [[bachelor's degree]], or a [[master's degree]]. Courses normally last three years, although it is common for students to be initially registered for [[MPhil]] degrees and then formally transferred onto the PhD after a year or two. Students who are not considered likely to complete a PhD may be offered the opportunity to complete an MPhil instead.<ref name=\"Prospects PhD\">{{cite web|url=https://www.prospects.ac.uk/postgraduate-study/phd-study/what-is-a-phd|title=What is a PhD?|publisher=Graduate Prospects Ltd.|accessdate=1 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006014106/https://www.prospects.ac.uk/postgraduate-study/phd-study/what-is-a-phd|archive-date=6 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIntegrated doctorates, originally known as 'New Route PhDs', were introduced from 2000 onwards. These integrate teaching at master's level during the first one or two years of the degree, either alongside research or as a preliminary to starting research. These courses usually offer a master's-level exit degree after the taught courses are completed. While passing the taught elements is often required, examination of the final doctorate is still by thesis (or equivalent) alone.<ref name=\"QAA Doctorate\"/> The duration of integrated doctorates is a minimum of four years, with three years spent on the research component.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/Masters-Degree-Characteristics-15.pdf|title=Characteristics Statement: Master's Degree|date=September 2015|page=6|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|accessdate=1 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006014405/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/Masters-Degree-Characteristics-15.pdf|archive-date=6 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[Research Councils UK]] issued a 'Statement of Expectations for Postgraduate Training', which lays out the expectations for training in PhDs funded by the research councils.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vitae.ac.uk/news/rcuk-unveils-expectations-for-doctoral-training-support|title=RCUK unveils expectations for doctoral training support|publisher=Vitae.ac.uk|accessdate=1 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006015535/https://www.vitae.ac.uk/news/rcuk-unveils-expectations-for-doctoral-training-support|archive-date=6 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In the latest version (2016), issued together with [[Cancer Research UK]], the [[Wellcome Trust]] and the [[British Heart Foundation]], these include the provision of careers advice, in-depth advanced training in the subject area, provision of transferable skills, training in experimental design and statistics, training in good research conduct, and training for compliance with legal, ethical and professional frameworks.

Typically the candidate submits a collection of previously published, peer-refereed work, which is reviewed by a committee of internal and external academics who decide whether the candidate deserves the doctorate. The higher doctorate is similar in some respects to the [[habilitation]] in some European countries. However, the purpose of the award is significantly different. While the habilitation formally determines whether an academic is suitably qualified to be a university professor, the higher doctorate does not qualify the holder for a position but rather recognises their contribution to research.<ref name=\"higher doctorates 2013\"/>\n\nHigher doctorates were defined by the UK Council for Graduate Education (UKCGE) in 2013 as:<ref name=\"higher doctorates 2013\"/>\n{{quote|an award that is at a level above the PhD (or equivalent professional doctorate in the discipline), and that is typically gained not through a defined programme of study but rather by submission of a substantial body of research-based work.}}\n\nIn terms of number of institutions offering the awards, the most common doctorates of this type in UKCGE surveys carried out in 2008 and 2013 were the [[Doctor of Science]] (DSc), [[Doctor of Letters]] (DLitt), [[Doctor of Law]] (LLD), [[Doctor of Music]] (DMus) and [[Doctor of Divinity]] (DD); in the 2008 survey the [[Doctor of Technology]] (DTech) tied with the DD.<ref name=\"higher doctorates 2013\"/> The DSc was offered by all 49 responding institutions in 2008 and 15 out of 16 in 2013 and the DLitt by only one less in each case, while the DD was offered in 10 responding institutions in 2008 and 3 in 2013. In terms of number of higher doctorates awarded (not including honorary doctorates) the DSc was most popular, but the number of awards was very low: the responding institutions had averaged an award of at most one earned higher doctorate per year over the period 2003\u20132013.<ref name=\"higher doctorates 2013\"/>\n\n====Honorary degrees====\nMost British universities award degrees ''honoris causa'' to recognise individuals who have made a substantial contribution to a particular field. Usually an appropriate higher doctorate is used in these circumstances, depending on the candidate's achievements. However, some universities differentiate between honorary and substantive doctorates, using the degree of [[Doctor of the University]] (D.Univ.) for these purposes, and reserve the higher doctorates for formal academic research.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Woolsey Hall, Yale University.jpg|thumb|In 1861, [[Yale University]] awarded the first [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)]] degree in the United States.]]\n\nThe structure of US doctoral programs is more formal and complex than some others. US research doctorates are awarded for successfully completing and defending independent research presented in the form of a dissertation, along with advanced study. Multiple professional degrees use the term \"doctor\" in their title, such as [[Juris Doctor]] and [[Doctor of Medicine]], but these degrees do not always contain an independent research component or always require a dissertation and should not be confused with Ph.D./D.Phil./[[Doctor of Education|Ed.D./D.Ed.]] degrees or other research doctorates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/professional.doc |format=DOC |title=Credential Creep |website=2.ed.gov |accessdate=2016-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823140419/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/professional.doc |archive-date=2016-08-23 |url-status=live }}</ref> Law school graduates, although awarded the J.D. degree, are not normally addressed as \"doctor\".

In most countries, it is a research degree that qualifies the holder to teach at university level in the degree's field, or to work in a specific [[profession]]. There are a number of doctoral degrees; the most common is the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD), which is awarded in many different fields, ranging from the [[humanities]] to [[science|scientific]] disciplines.\n\nIn the United States and some other countries, there are also some types of technical or [[professional degree]]s that include doctor in their name and are, in some of those countries, classified as doctorates. Professional doctorates historically came about to meet the needs of practitioners in a variety of disciplines. However, the necessity of these degrees may vary greatly across disciplines, making their significance unclear.\n\nMany universities also award [[honorary doctorate]]s to individuals deemed worthy of special recognition, either for scholarly work or for other contributions to the university or to society.\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe term ''doctor'' derives from Latin, meaning \"teacher\" or \"instructor\".

The doctorate of philosophy adheres to this historic convention, even though the degrees are not always for the study of philosophy. Chris Park explains that it was not until formal education and degree programs were standardized in the early 19th century that the doctorate of philosophy was reintroduced in Germany as a research degree,<ref name=\"Redefining the Doctorate\">Park, C.

(similar to Ph.D. in Anglo-American countries). Germany, however, differentiated then in more detail between doctorates in philosophy and doctorates in the natural sciences, abbreviated as [[Dr. rer. nat.]], and also doctorates in the social/political sciences, abbreviated as Dr. rer. pol., similar to the other traditional doctorates in medicine (Dr. med.) and law (Dr. jur.).\n\nUniversity doctoral training was a form of [[apprenticeship]] to a [[guild]]. The traditional term of study before new teachers were admitted to the guild of \"Masters of Arts\" was seven years, matching the apprenticeship term for other occupations. Originally the terms \"master\" and \"doctor\" were synonymous, but over time the doctorate came to be regarded as a higher qualification than the [[master's degree]].\n\nUniversity degrees, including doctorates, were originally restricted to men. The first women to be granted doctorates were [[Juliana Morell]] in 1608 at Lyons,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Juliana_Morell|title=Juliana Morell|encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopaedia|date=1913|access-date=2016-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018200827/https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Juliana_Morell|archive-date=2016-10-18|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Elena Cornaro Piscopia]] in 1678 at the [[University of Padua]], [[Laura Bassi]] in 1732 at [[Bologna University]], [[Dorothea Erxleben]] in 1754 at [[Halle University]] and  [[Mar\u00eda Isidra de Guzm\u00e1n y de la Cerda]] in 1785 at [[Complutense University]], Madrid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uah.es/universidad/presentacion/historia_universidad.shtm|title=Universidad de Alcal\u00e1|author=Universidad de Alcala (UAH), Madrid|work=uah.es|access-date=2012-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007070354/http://www.uah.es/universidad/presentacion/historia_universidad.shtm|archive-date=2012-10-07|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Modern times===\nThe use and meaning of the doctorate has changed over time, and is subject to regional variations. For instance, until the early 20th century few academic staff or professors in [[English (language)|English-speaking]] universities held doctorates, except for very senior scholars and those in [[Holy Orders|holy orders]]. After that time the [[Higher education in Germany|German practice]] of requiring lecturers to have completed a research doctorate spread. Universities' shift to research-oriented education (based upon the scientific method, inquiry, and observation) increased the doctorate's importance. Today, a research doctorate (PhD) or its equivalent (as defined in the US by the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]) is generally a prerequisite for an [[Academia|academic]] career, although many recipients do not work in academia.\n\nProfessional doctorates developed in the United States from the 19th century onward. The first professional doctorate to be offered in the United States was the [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] at Kings College (now [[Columbia University]]) after the medical school's founding in 1767,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/history.html|title=A Brief History of Columbia|work=columbia.edu|access-date=2016-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517080232/http://www.columbia.edu/content/history.html|archive-date=2016-05-17|url-status=live}}</ref> although this was not a professional doctorate in the modern American sense as it was awarded for further study after the qualifying Bachelor of Medicine (M.B.) rather than being a qualifying degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps.columbia.edu/about-ps/history-college-physicians-and-surgeons|title=History of the College of Physicians and Surgeons|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=7 October 2016|quote=King's College organized a medical faculty in 1767 and was the first institution in the North American Colonies to confer the degree of Doctor of Medicine.

These doctorates are less common than the PhD in some countries and are often awarded ''[[honoris causa]]''. The [[habilitation]] is still used for academic recruitment purposes in many countries within the EU, and involves either a new long thesis (a second book) or a portfolio of research publications. The habilitation (highest available degree) demonstrates independent and thorough research, experience in teaching and lecturing, and, more recently, the ability to generate supportive funding. The habilitation follows the research doctorate, and in Germany it can be a requirement for appointment as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' or professor.\n\n==Types==\n{{further|Doctor (title)}}\nSince the [[Middle Ages]], the number and types of doctorates awarded by universities has proliferated throughout the world.

In Austria, the habilitation bestows the graduate with the ''facultas docendi'', ''venia legendi'' and, since 2004, the honorary title of \"Privatdozent\" (prior to this, completing the habilitation resulted in appointment as a civil servant). In many countries of [[Central and Eastern Europe]], the degree gives ''venia legendi'', Latin for \"the permission to lecture,\" or ''ius docendi'', \"the right to teach,\" a specific academic subject at universities for a lifetime.

The doctor's degree classification encompasses three main subcategories\u2014research/scholarship degrees, professional practice degrees, and other degrees\u2014which are described below.<br />Doctor's degree-research/scholarship: A Ph.D. or other doctor's degree that requires advanced work beyond the master's level, including the preparation and defense of a dissertation based on original research, or the planning and execution of an original project demonstrating substantial artistic or scholarly achievement. Examples of this type of degree may include the following and others, as designated by the awarding institution: the Ed.D.

The degree is awarded after a period of study such that the total time to the degree, including both preprofessional and professional preparation, equals at least 6 full-time-equivalent academic years. Some doctor's degrees of this type were formerly classified as first-professional degrees. Examples of this type of degree may include the following and others, as designated by the awarding institution: the D.C. or D.C.M. (in chiropractic); D.D.S. or D.M.D. (in dentistry); L.L.B. or J.D.

Exceptions are based on their individual academic merit. A second and a third foreign language are other common requirements, although the requirements regarding proficiency commonly are not strict. The admissions process varies by institution. Some require candidates to take tests while others base admissions on a research proposal application and interview only. In both instances however, a faculty member must agree prior to admission to supervise the applicant.\n\nRequirements usually include satisfactory performance in advanced graduate courses, passing an oral qualifying exam and submitting a thesis that must represent an original and relevant contribution to existing knowledge. The thesis is examined in a final public oral exam administered by at least five faculty members, two of whom must be external. After completion, which normally consumes 4 years, the candidate is commonly awarded the degree of ''Doutor'' (Doctor) followed by the main area of specialization, e.g. ''Doutor em Direito'' (Doctor of Laws), ''Doutor em Ci\u00eancias da Computa\u00e7\u00e3o'' (Doctor of Computer Sciences), ''Doutor em Filosofia'' (Doctor of Philosophy), ''Doutor em Economia'' (Doctor of Economics), ''Doutor em Engenharia'' (Doctor of Engineering) or ''Doutor em Medicina'' (Doctor of Medicine). The generic title of ''Doutor em Ci\u00eancias'' (Doctor of Sciences) is normally used to refer collectively to doctorates in the natural sciences (i.e. Physics, Chemistry, Biological and Life Sciences, etc.)\n\nAll graduate programs in Brazilian public universities are tuition-free (mandated by the [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian constitution]]). Some graduate students are additionally supported by institutional scholarships granted by federal government agencies like CNPq (''Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico'') and CAPES (''Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento do Pessoal de Ensino Superior''). Personal scholarships are provided by the various FAP's (''Funda\u00e7\u00f5es de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa'') at the state level, especially FAPESP in the state of [[S\u00e3o Paulo state|S\u00e3o Paulo]], FAPERJ in the state of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and FAPEMIG in the state of [[Minas Gerais]]. Competition for graduate financial aid is intense and most scholarships support at most 2 years of Master's studies and 4 years of doctoral studies. The normal monthly stipend for doctoral students in Brazil is between US$500 and $1000.\n\nA degree of ''Doutor'' usually enables an individual to apply for a junior faculty position equivalent to a US [[assistant professor]]. Progression to full professorship, known as ''Professor Titular'' requires that the candidate be successful in a competitive public exam and normally takes additional years. In the federal university system, doctors who are admitted as junior faculty members may progress (usually by seniority) to the rank of associate professor, then become eligible to take the competitive exam for vacant full professorships. In S\u00e3o Paulo state universities, associate professorships and subsequent eligibility to apply for a full professorship are conditioned on the qualification of [[:pt:Livre-doc\u00eancia|Livre-docente]] and requires, in addition to a doctorate, a second thesis or cumulative portfolio of peer-reviewed publications, a public lecture before a panel of experts (including external members from other universities), and a written exam.\n\nIn recent years some initiatives as jointly supervised doctorates (e.g. \"cotutelles\") have become increasingly common in the country, as part of the country's efforts to open its universities to international students.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Olavo Leite|first1=Andr\u00e9|last2=Carmo|first2=Valter Moura|title=Os doutorados em cotutela no Brasil e em seus principais parceiros acad\u00eamicos|journal=Revista Brasileira de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o|date=2014|volume=11|issue=26|pages=969\u2013997|url=http://ojs.rbpg.capes.gov.br/index.php/rbpg/article/view/560|access-date=2015-05-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522063228/http://ojs.rbpg.capes.gov.br/index.php/rbpg/article/view/560|archive-date=2015-05-22|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\n[[Denmark]] offers four levels of degrees: 1) a three-year bachelor's degree (e.g. Bachelor of Arts degree); 2) a five-year candidate's degree (e.g. ''Candidatus/Candidata Magisterii''), generally compared to a master's degree; 3) a ph.d.<!-- \"ph.d.\" is the correct spelling of this Danish degree. It should not be confused with the English Ph.D. --> degree, which replaced the [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in 1988; 4) a doctor's degree (e.g. ''Doctor Philosophiae''), which is the higher doctorate. (A three-year extended research program, leading to the magister's degree was phased out to meet the international standards of the [[Bologna Process]].)\n\nFor the Ph.D. degree, the candidate writes a thesis and defends it orally at a formal [[disputation]]. In the disputation, the candidate defends their thesis against three official opponents as well as opponents from the [[auditorium]] ''(ex auditorio)''.\n\nFor the higher doctorate, the candidate writes a major thesis and has to defend it orally in which the candidate (called ''pr\u00e6ses'') defends this thesis against two official opponents as well as opponents from the auditorium (''ex auditorio'').\n\n===Egypt===\nIn Egypt, the highest degree doctorate is awarded by [[Al-Azhar University]] est. 970, which grants ( \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0100limiyya\\ [[Habilitation]]).\n\nThe Medical doctorate (abbreviated as M.D.) is equivalent to the [[Ph.D.]] degree.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180413220705/http://www.seci.info/staff23.htm ]</ref> To earn an M.D. in a science specialty, one must have a master's degree (M.Sc.) (or two diplomas before the introduction of M.Sc. degree in Egypt) before applying. The M.D. degree involves courses in the field and defending a dissertation. It takes on average three to five years.\n\nMany postgraduate medical and surgical specialties students earn a doctorate. After finishing a 6-year medical school and one-year internship (house officer), physicians and surgeons earn the M.B. B.Ch. degree, which is equivalent to a US [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree. They can then apply to earn a master's degree or a speciality diploma, then an MD degree in a specialty.\n\nThe Egyptian M.D. degree is written using the name of one's specialty. For example, M.D. (Geriatrics) means a doctorate in [[Geriatrics]], which is equivalent to a Ph.D. in Geriatrics.<!--\\\nAcademic sciences like Microbiology earn a Ph.D. degree.-->\n\n===Finland===\nThe Finnish requirement for the entrance into doctoral studies is a master's degree or equivalent.

Entrance is not as controlled as in undergraduate studies, where a strict [[numerus clausus#Numerus clausus in Finland|numerus clausus]] is applied.

The requirement was removed in 2005, leaving the decision to individual universities, which may delegate the authority to faculties or individual professors. In Engineering and Science, required coursework varies between 40 and 70 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]].\n\nThe duration of graduate studies varies. It is possible to graduate three years after the master's degree, while much longer periods are not uncommon. The study ends with a dissertation, which must present substantial new scientific/scholarly knowledge. The dissertation can either be a monograph or it an edited collection of 3 to 7 journal articles. Students unable or unwilling to write a dissertation may qualify for a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] degree by completing the coursework requirement and writing a shorter thesis, usually summarizing one year of research.\n\nWhen the dissertation is ready, the faculty names two expert pre-examiners with doctoral degrees from the outside the university. During the pre-examination process, the student may receive comments on the work and respond with modifications.<ref>{{in lang|fi}} [https://archive.today/20120530044420/https://oa.doria.fi/handle/10024/42487 Peura, A (2004) Tohtoriksi tulemisen tarina].

The opponent and the candidate conduct a formal debate, usually wearing [[white tie]], under the supervision of the thesis supervisor. Family, friends, colleagues and the members of the research community customarily attend the defence. After a formal entrance, the candidate begins with an approximately 20-minute popular lecture (''lectio praecursoria''), that is meant to introduce laymen to the thesis topic. The opponent follows with a short talk on the topic, after which the pair critically discuss the dissertation. The proceedings take two to three hours. At the end the opponent presents their final statement and reveals whether he/she will recommend that the faculty accept it. Any member of the public then has an opportunity to raise questions, although this is rare. Immediately after the defence, the supervisor, the opponent and the candidate drink coffee with the public. Usually, the attendees of the defence are given the printed dissertation.<ref>{{in lang|fi}} [https://archive.today/20120530044420/https://oa.doria.fi/handle/10024/42487 Peura, A (2004) Tohtoriksi tulemisen tarina].

Exceptions may be granted by the university governing board, but this is uncommon, and usually due to other work and expertise considered equivalent.\n\n===France<!--'Doctorat', 'Doctorat d'universit\u00e9', 'Doctorat de troisi\u00e8me cycle', and 'Doctorat de sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9' redirect here-->===\n;History\nBefore 1984 three research doctorates existed in France: the [[State doctorate]] (''doctorat d'\u00c9tat'', \"DrE\", the old doctorate introduced in 1808), the third cycle doctorate (''Doctorat de troisi\u00e8me cycle'', also called doctorate of specialty, ''Doctorat de sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9'', created in 1954 and shorter than the State doctorate) and the [[diploma]] of doctor-engineer (''dipl\u00f4me de docteur-ing\u00e9nieur'' created in 1923), for technical research.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, following the submission of two theses (primary thesis, ''th\u00e8se principale'', and secondary thesis, ''th\u00e8se compl\u00e9mentaire'') to the Faculty of Letters (in France, \"letters\" is equivalent to \"[[humanities]]\") at the [[University of Paris]], the doctoral candidate was awarded the ''[[Doctorat \u00e8s lettres]]''. There was also the less prestigious \"university doctorate\" ''Doctorat d'universit\u00e9'' which could be received for the submission of a single thesis.\n\nIn the 1950s, the ''Doctorat \u00e8s lettres'' was renamed to ''Doctorat d'\u00c9tat''.<ref name=\"Schrift p. 208\">Alan D. Schrift (2006), ''Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes And Thinkers'', Blackwell Publishing, p. 208.</ref> In 1954 (for the [[Natural science|sciences]]) and 1958 (for letters and [[human sciences]]), the less demanding ''Doctorat de troisi\u00e8me cycle'' degree was created on the model of the American [[Ph.D.]] with the purpose to lessen what had become an increasingly long period of time between the typical students' completion of their Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures, roughly equivalent to a [[Master of Arts]]) and their ''Doctorat d'\u00c9tat''.<ref name=\"Schrift p. 208\"/>\n\nAfter 1984, only one type of doctoral degree remained: the \"doctorate\" (''Doctorat''). A special diploma was created called the \"accreditation to supervise research\" (''Habilitation \u00e0 diriger des recherches''), a professional qualification to supervise doctoral work. (This diploma is similar in spirit to the older State doctorate, and the requirements for obtaining it are similar to those necessary to obtain [[tenure]] in other systems.) Before only professors or senior full researchers of similar rank were normally authorized to supervise a doctoral candidate's work.<ref>H. D. Lewis, ''The French Education System'', Routledge, 1985, {{ISBN|0-7099-1683-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7099-1683-3}}</ref> Now habilitation is a prerequisite to the title of professor in university (''Professeur des universit\u00e9s'') and to the title of Research Director (''Directeur de recherche'') in national public research agency such as [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|CNRS]], [[Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique|INRIA]], or [[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique|INRAE]].\n\n;Admission\nToday, the doctorate (''doctorat'') is a research-only degree. It is a national degree and its requirements are fixed by the minister of higher education and research. Only public institutions award the doctorate. It can be awarded in any field of study. The [[Master's degree in Europe|master's degree]] is a prerequisite. The normal duration is three years. The [[redaction]] of a comprehensive thesis constitutes the bulk of the doctoral work. While the length of the thesis varies according to the discipline, it is rarely less than 150 pages, and often substantially more. Some 15,000 new doctoral matriculations occur every year and ~10,000 doctorates are awarded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid20185/doctorat.html |title=La formation doctorale \u2013 ESR |website=Enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202110630/http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid20185/doctorat.html |archive-date=2016-12-02 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDoctoral candidates can apply for a three-year fellowship. The most well known is the ''Contrat Doctoral'' (4,000 granted every year with a gross salary of 1758 euros per months {{as of|2016|September|lc=y}}).\n\nSince 2002 candidates follow in-service training, but there is no written examination for the doctorate. The candidate has to write a thesis that is read by two external reviewers. The head of the institution decides whether the candidate can defend the thesis, after considering the external reviews. The jury members are designated by the head of the institution. The candidate's supervisor and the external reviewers are generally jury members. The maximum number of jury members is 8. The defense generally lasts 45 minutes in scientific fields, followed by 1 \u2013 2 and a half hours of questions from the jury or other doctors present. The defense and questions are public. The jury then deliberates in private and then declares the candidate admitted or \"postponed\". The latter is rare. New regulations were set in 2016 and do not award distinctions.\n\nThe title of doctor (''docteur'') can also be used by medical and pharmaceutical practitioners who hold a doctor's State diploma (''dipl\u00f4me d'\u00c9tat de docteur''). The diploma is a first-degree.\n\n===Germany<!--'Promotion (Germany)' and 'Inaugural thesis' redirect here-->===\nDoctoral degrees in Germany are research doctorates and are awarded by a process called '''''Promotion'''''<!--italics per MOS:Ety; boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (\"promotion\"). The concept of a US-style [[professional doctorate]] as an entry-level professional qualification does not exist. However, in medicine, \"doctoral\" dissertations are often written alongside undergraduate study. The [[European Research Council]] decided in 2010 that such Dr. med. degrees do not meet the international standards of a Ph. D. research degree.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bildung/qualitaet-medizinischer-promotionen-kommt-ein-doktor-zum-arzt--1.2673150|work=[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]|date=1 October 2015|title=Kommt ein Doktor zum Arzt ...|author=Sarah Schmidt|access-date=14 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406172355/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bildung/qualitaet-medizinischer-promotionen-kommt-ein-doktor-zum-arzt--1.2673150|archive-date=6 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/lebenundlernen/uni/von-der-leyen-in-der-kritik-schlechte-promotionen-sind-in-der-medizin-ueblich-a-1055039.html|title=Akademische Ramschware|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=28 September 2015|author=Bernd Kramer|access-date=14 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624133658/http://www.spiegel.de/lebenundlernen/uni/von-der-leyen-in-der-kritik-schlechte-promotionen-sind-in-der-medizin-ueblich-a-1055039.html|archive-date=24 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The duration of the doctorate depends on the field: a doctorate in medicine may take less than a full-time year to complete; those in other fields, two to six years. Most doctorates are awarded with specific Latin designations for the field of research (except for engineering, where the designation is German), instead of a general name for all fields (such as the [[Ph.D.]]). The most important degrees are:\n* ''[[Dr. rer. nat.]]'' (''rerum naturalium''; [[Natural science|natural]] and [[Formal science|formal]] sciences, i.e. physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, computer science and information technology, or psychology);\n* ''Dr. phil.'' (''philosophiae''; humanities such as philosophy, philology, history, and social sciences such as sociology, political science, or psychology as well);\n* ''Dr. iur.'' (''iuris''; law);\n* ''Dr. oec.'' (''oeconomiae''; economics);\n* ''Dr. rer. pol.'' (''rerum politicarum''; economics, business administration, political science);\n* ''Dr. theol.'' (''theologiae''; theology);\n* ''Dr. med.'' (''medicinae''; medicine);\n* ''Dr. med. dent.'' (''medicinae dentariae''; dentistry);\n* ''Dr. med. vet.'' (''medicinae veterinariae''; veterinary medicine);\n* ''[[Doktoringenieur|Dr.-Ing.]]'' (engineering).\n\nOver fifty such designations exist, many of them rare or no longer in use. As a title, the degree is commonly written in front of the name in abbreviated form, e.g., ''Dr. rer. nat. Max Mustermann'' or ''Dr. Max Mustermann'', dropping the designation entirely. However, leaving out the designation is only allowed when the doctorate degree is not an honorary doctorate, which must be indicated by ''Dr. h.c.'' (from Latin honoris causa). Although the honorific does not become part of the name, holders can demand that the title appear in official documents. The title is not mandatory. The honorific is commonly used in formal letters. For holders of other titles, only the highest title is mentioned. Multiple holders of doctorate degrees can be addressed as ''Dres.'' (from Latin ''doctores''). Professional doctorates obtained in other countries, not requiring a thesis or not being third cycle qualifications under the Bologna process, can only be used postnominally, e.g., \"Max Mustermann, MD\", and do not allow the use of the title Dr.<ref>{{cite web| title = F\u00fchrung ausl\u00e4ndischer Hochschulgrade| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090411040259/http://www.kmk.org/wissenschaft-hochschule/internationale-hochschulangelegenheiten/fuehrung-auslaendischer-hochschulgrade.html| archive-date = 11 April 2009| url = http://www.kmk.org/wissenschaft-hochschule/internationale-hochschulangelegenheiten/fuehrung-auslaendischer-hochschulgrade.html| url-status = dead}}</ref> In contrast to English, in which a person's name is preceded by at most one title (except in very ceremonious usage), the formal German mode of address permits several titles in addition to \"Herr\" or \"Frau\" (which, unlike \"Mr\" or \"Ms\", is not considered a title at all, but an ''Anrede'' or \"address\"), including repetitions in the case of multiple degrees, as in \"Frau Prof. Dr. Dr. Schmidt\",<ref>{{cite web| title=Duden: Professorinnen und Professoren anschreiben oder anreden | url=https://www.duden.de/sprachwissen/sprachratgeber/Professorinnen-und-Professoren-anschreiben-oder-anreden}}</ref> for a person who would be addressed as \"Prof. Schmidt\" in English.\n\nIn the German university system it is common to write two doctoral theses, the inaugural thesis ('''''Inauguraldissertation''''')<!--italics per MOS:Ety; boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, completing a course of study, and the [[habilitation]] thesis (''[[Habilitationsschrift]]''), which opens the road to a professorship.<ref>Carl Brockelmann, ''History of the Arabic Written Tradition'', Volume 1, BRILL, 2016, p. vii.</ref> Upon completion of the habilitation thesis, a ''Habilitation'' is awarded, which is indicated by appending ''habil.'' (''habilitata/habilitatus'') to the doctorate, e.g., ''Dr. rer. nat. habil. Max Mustermann''. It is considered as an additional academic qualification rather than an academic degree formally. It qualifies the owner to teach at German universities (''facultas docendi''). The holder of a ''Habilitation'' receives the authorization to teach a certain subject (''venia legendi''). This has been the traditional prerequisite for attaining [[Privatdozent|''Privatdozent'' (PD)]] and employment as a full university [[professor]]. With the introduction of ''Juniorprofessuren''\u2014around 2005\u2014as an alternative track towards becoming a professor at universities (with tenure), ''Habilitation'' is no longer the only university career track.\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], doctorates are offered by universities. Entry requirements include master's degree. Some universities consider undergraduate degrees in professional areas such as engineering, medicine or law as qualifications for pursuing doctorate level degrees. Entrance examinations are held for almost all programs. In most universities, coursework duration and thesis is 5\u20136 years. The most common doctoral degree is Ph.D.\n\n===Italy===\nItaly uses a three-level degree system. The first-level degree, called a \"[[laurea]]\" (''Bachelor's degree''), requires three years and a short thesis. The second-level degree, called a \"[[Laurea|laurea magistrale]]\" (''Master's degree''), is obtained after two additional years, specializing in a branch of the field. This degree requires more advanced thesis work, usually involving academic research or an internship. The final degree is called a \"[[Laurea|dottorato di ricerca]]\" (''Ph.D.'') and is obtained after three years of academic research on the subject and a thesis.\n\nAlternatively, after obtaining the ''laurea'' or the ''laurea magistrale'' one can complete a \"Master's\" (first-level Master's after the ''laurea''; second-level Master's after the ''laurea magistrale'') of one or two years, usually including an internship. An Italian \"Master's\" is not the same as a master's degree; it is intended to be more focused on professional training and practical experience.\n\nRegardless of the field of study, the title for Bachelors Graduate students is ''[[Dottore]]/Dottoressa'' (abbrev. ''Dott.''/''Dott.ssa'', or as ''Dr.''), not to be confused with the title for the Ph.D., which is instead ''Dottore/Dottoressa di Ricerca''. A ''laurea magistrale'' grants instead the title of ''Dottore/Dottoressa magistrale''. Graduates in the fields of Education, Art and Music are also called ''Dr. Prof.'' (or simply ''Professore'') or ''Maestro''. Many professional titles, such as ''ingegnere'' (engineer) are awarded only upon passing a post-graduation examination (''esame di stato''), and registration in the relevant professional association.\n\nThe first institution in [[Italy]] to create a [[doctoral]] program ([[Ph.D.]]) was [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]] in 1927 under the historic name ''\"Diploma di Perfezionamento\"''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://download.sns.it/SNSguida_eng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041947/http://download.sns.it/SNSguida_eng.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-26 }}</ref><ref name=\"sns.it\">{{in lang|it}} [http://www.sns.it/scuola/istituzionale/regolamentointerno/download/statuto_sns.pdf STATUTO DELLA SCUOLA NORMALE SUPERIORE DI PISA (legge 18 giugno 1986, n. 308)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217040548/http://www.sns.it/scuola/istituzionale/regolamentointerno/download/statuto_sns.pdf |date=2012-02-17 }}</ref> Further, the [[research]] [[doctorates]] or [[Ph.D.]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Dottorato di ricerca'') in [[Italy]] were introduced with law and [[Presidential Decree]] in 1980 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20111104111953/http://www.italgiure.giustizia.it/nir/1980/lexs_88887.html Law of February 21, 1980, No. 28] and the [[Presidential Decree]] [http://www.edscuola.it/archivio/norme/decreti/dpr382_80.html No. 382 of 11 July 1980]), referring to the reform of academic teaching, training and experimentation in organisation and teaching methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italgiure.giustizia.it/nir/1980/lexs_88887.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104111953/http://www.italgiure.giustizia.it/nir/1980/lexs_88887.html |archivedate=2011-11-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Dario Cillo |url=http://www.edscuola.it/archivio/norme/decreti/dpr382_80.html |title=Decreto Presidente Repubblica 11 luglio 1980, n. 382 |website=Edscuola.it |date= |accessdate=2016-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160929114656/http://www.edscuola.it/archivio/norme/decreti/dpr382_80.html |archive-date=2016-09-29 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHence the [[Superior Graduate Schools in Italy]] ([[Grandes \u00e9coles]])<ref name=\"ricercaitaliana.it\">{{in lang|it}} [http://www.ricercaitaliana.it/scuole_eccellenza.htm Ricerca Italiana, Scuole di Eccellenza] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307161729/http://www.ricercaitaliana.it/scuole_eccellenza.htm |date=2012-03-07 }}</ref> ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Scuola Superiore Universitaria''),<ref name=\"bompard2000\">{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=150222&sectioncode=26|title=Italy's big six form network for elite|work=Times Higher Education|access-date=2012-02-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923152548/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=150222&sectioncode=26|archive-date=2012-09-23|url-status=live}}</ref> also called ''Schools of Excellence'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Scuole di Eccellenza'')<ref name=\"ricercaitaliana.it\" /><ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://scuoledieccellenza.it/ Scuole di Eccellenza] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522045557/http://scuoledieccellenza.it/ |date=2012-05-22 }}</ref> such as [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]] and [[Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies]] keep their historical ''\"Diploma di Perfezionamento\"'' [[Ph.D.]] title by [[law]]<ref name=\"sns.it\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sssup.it/UploadDocs/7768_Legge_istitutiva_SSSA.pdf |title=Article 3 of the Law of 14 February 1987, No.41 {{!}} L. 14 febbraio 1987, n. 41 Istituzione della Scuola superiore di studi universitari e di perfezionamento S.

It produced the majority of engineering doctoral degrees from national universities. University-based doctoral programs called {{nihongo|''katei hakase''|\u8ab2\u7a0b\u535a\u58eb}}, are gradually replacing these degrees.

(with equivalent degrees in engineering \u2013 ir. and law \u2013 mr.) and ''doctor'' (dr.). After successful completion of the first year of university, the student was awarded the propaedeutic diploma (not a degree). In some fields, this diploma was abolished in the 1980s. In physics and mathematics, the student could directly obtain a ''kandidaats (candidate)'' diploma in two years. The candidate diploma was all but abolished by 1989. It used to be attained after completion of the majority of courses of the academic study (usually after completion of course requirements of the third year in the program), after which the student was allowed to begin work on their doctorandus thesis. The successful completion of this thesis conveyed the ''[[doctorandus|doctoranda/us]]'' title, implying that the student's initial studies were finished. In addition to these 'general' degrees, specific titles equivalent to the ''doctorandus'' degree were awarded for law: ''meester'' (master) (mr.), and for engineering: ''ingenieur'' (engineer)(ir.). Following the Bologna protocol the Dutch adopted the Anglo-Saxon system of academic degrees. The old candidate's degree was revived to become the bachelor's degree and the doctorandus' (mr and ir degree) were replaced by master's degrees. Dutch university programmes tend to include advanced subject matter that e.g., at Harvard is taught in Ph.D.-courses (for instance advanced [[quantum mechanics]] or [[general relativity]] in a Dutch course for the master's degree in [[theoretical physics]]).\n\nStudents can only enroll in a doctorate system after completing a research university level master's degree; although dispensation can be granted on a case by case basis after scrutiny of the individual's portfolio. The most common way to conduct doctoral studies is to work as ''promovendus''/''assistant in opleiding'' (aio)/''onderzoeker in opleiding'' (oio) ([[research assistant]] with additional courses and supervision), perform extensive research and write a dissertation consisting of published articles (over a period of four or more years, averaging about 5.5 to 6). Research can also be conducted without official research assistant status, for example through a business-sponsored research laboratory.\n\nEvery Ph.D. thesis has to be promoted by a full university professor who has the role of principal advisor. The promotor (professor) determines whether the thesis quality suffices and can be submitted to the committee of experts. A committee of experts in the field review the thesis. Failures at this stage are rare because supervisors withhold inadequate work. The supervisors and promotor lose prestige among their colleagues should they allow a substandard thesis to be submitted.\n\nAfter reviewer approval, the candidate publishes the thesis (generally more than 100 copies) and sends it to colleagues, friends and family with an invitation to the public defense. The degree is awarded in a formal, public, defense session, in which the thesis is defended against critical questions of the \"opposition\" (the review committee). Failure during this session is possible, but rare. Before the defense there may or may not be a public presentation, lasting 10 minutes (e.g. Eindhoven University) to exactly half hour (e.g. Delft University). The actual defense lasts exactly the assigned time slot (45 minutes to 1 hour exactly depending on the university) after which the defense is stopped by the [[bedel]] who closes the process.\n\nThe doctor's title is the highest academic degree in the Netherlands. In research doctorates the degree is always Ph.D. with no distinction between disciplines. Three Dutch universities of technology ([[Eindhoven University of Technology]], [[Delft University of Technology]], and [[University of Twente]]) also award a (lower ranked) [[Professional Doctorate in Engineering]] ([[Professional Doctorate in Engineering|PDEng]]).\n\nAlthough the title doctor is informally called Ph.D., legally no Ph.D. degree exists. All other university titles (B.Sc./B.Ba./LL.B./B.A. M.Sc./M.B.A./LL.M./M.A.) are protected by law, while Ph.D. is not.

Doctorandus is still used as a synonym for a Ph.D. student. The ''licentiaat'' (licensee) title was in use for a regular graduate until the Bologna reform changed the licentiaat degree to the master's degree (the Bologna reform abolished the two-year kandidaat degree and introduced a three-year academic bachelor's degree instead).\n<!---\n===Nepal===\nIn Nepal, doctorate level degrees are offered by the universities or institutions of national level importance deemed to be universities. Entry requirements for doctorates by most of the universities include good academic background at masters level (post graduate degree). Some universities also consider undergraduate degrees in professional areas such as engineering, medicine or law for entrance to doctorate level degrees. Entrance examinations are held for almost all the universities for admission to doctoral level degrees. The duration of the coursework and thesis for award of the degree is 2 \u2013 3 years after Ph.D. registration.\n---->\n<!---\n===Pakistan===\nResearch Degrees are Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy) awarded after extensive research work including a compulsory one year of course work and written examination. To get admission in Ph.D. you must be admitted to the MPhil program for which you need to pass NTS or GRE (subjective or General) and should have good grades throughout your career. Exemption from MPhil is possible if you have MS from a reputable University.\n---->\n<!---\n===Poland===\nThe Polish system is similar to the one adopted in Germany, with Ph.D. as a first level doctorate and [[habilitation]] (''habilitacja'') as second. The award of the title of ''doktor'' (Ph.D.) is usually preceded by 4\u20135 years of doctoral study (a post-graduate study offered at most universities, during which candidate is employed by this university and is usually obligated to teach some classes) and a doctoral exam. Doctoral studies usually consist of seminars, lectures, research and teaching. In order to become a ''doktor habilitowany'' (i.e. to be awarded a second level doctorate) a candidate has to publish a dissertation that is the culmination of several years of deep field studies, as well as have a recognized research record. While, according to current Polish law, candidates without [[habilitation]] are theoretically eligible to become professors, in practice it is extremely rare. Since 1993 only Master-degree holders are allowed to become a doctor, while prior to that time it was possible (but rare) to gain doctorate without Master studies (for example [[Stefan Banach]]).\n\nFirst, a prospective doctor must have published some works (articles, books). To become a doctor one needs to go through the process called doctoral proceedings (''przew\u00f3d doktorski''). This proceedings include the writing of a [[dissertation]] (varying in length), which then must be accepted by a panel of professors during a so-called ''defence of the dissertation'' (''obrona pracy doktorskiej''). There are several other requirements, like passing an exam in a foreign language and subject related to the dissertation title.\n\nThe title of a first level doctor is abbreviated as ''dr'' (without a full stop) before the surname of a person, e.g. ''dr Kowalski'' and a second level ''dr hab.''. After becoming a doctor ''mgr'' is omitted, e.g. ''mgr'' \u2192 ''dr'', ''mgr in\u017c.'' \u2192 ''dr in\u017c.''.\n\n''Doktor'' is also a common form of addressing a physician, but that does not indicate that the person actually holds a doctoral degree. Doctors of medicine have the abbreviation ''dr n. med.'' (doctor of medical science) before or after their surname.\n\nOther specific doctoral titles include ''dr n.t.'' (doctor of engineering) and ''dr n. farm'' (doctor of pharmaceutical science). ''Dr n.hum.'' means doctor of humanities (incl. psychology and sociology), but is rarely used to differentiate from doctors of other fields. All other doctorates have no indications of their field.\n---->\n<!---\n===Portugal===\n*Doutor (Doctor)\nAll doctoral programs are of research nature. Usually 3 or 4 years of study are required, mostly as a period of research. The student must write their thesis presenting a new discovery or original contribution to the field. If approved by his/her supervisor, the study will be presented to a panel of distinguished scholars. If approved, he or she will receive the doctorate.\n*Male title: \"Dr.\" and \"Doutor\". Female title: \"Dra.\" and \"Doutora\".\nIn Portugal it is common to use the title \"Dr.\" (supposedly the abbreviation of \"Doutor\") in reference to people with \"Licenciatura\" or \"Mestrado\" degrees.\nThus \"Doutor\" is commonly used in the extended form to denote someone with a doctorate. \"Professor Doutor\" is usually used for university professors.\n\nBefore the [[Bologna process|Bologna Process]] reform, a \"Licenciatura\" was something between a Bachelor (\"Bacharelato\" in Portugal) and it represented 4 to 6 years of graduate studies.\n\nAfter the [[Bologna process|Bologna Process]] reform in Portugal, the new \"Licenciatura\" degree is equivalent to the old \"Bacharelato\" (Bachelor with 3 or 4 years). There are also the \"Mestrado\" (Master's degree) and the \"Mestrado Integrado\" (integrated bachelor's and master's degree with 5 or 6 years, required for access to some professional fields).\nSome professionals have, however, different titles. For example: \"Eng.\" (Engenheiro, such as the Master of Engineering), \"Arq.\" (Arquitecto, Architect). The term \"Dr.\" in Portugal is also used for people from other professional fields. For Example, Dentists, Lawyers and Physicians.\n---->\n<!---\n===Russia===\nMany post-Soviet countries, including [[Russian Federation]], have a two-stage path to obtain research degrees, generally similar to the doctorate system in Europe. The first stage is named ''\"[[Kandidat]](\u041a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a) of <...> Sciences\"'' (the literal translation means \"Candidate of Sciences\",) (for instance, [[Kandidat]] of Medical Sciences, of Chemical Sciences, of Philological Sciences etc.). The Kandidat of Sciences degree is usually recognised as an equivalent of the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree and requires at least (and typically more than) three, four or five years of post-graduate research which is finished by defence of [[Dissertation]] or rarely\u2014[[thesis]]. Additionally, a seeker of the degree has to pass three examinations (a so-called \"Kandidate's minimum\"): in his/her special field, in a foreign language, and in the history and philosophy of science, which originates from the course of [[Communist Ideology]] named similar in Soviet times. After additional certification by the corresponding experts, the Kandidat degree may be recognized internationally as an equivalent of the Ph.D. (An unconditional Ph.D. equivalence has been recognized before the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], and the additional certification in many countries has become a requirement following the steep increased flow of post-Soviet emigration.) The second stage, [[Doktor nauk]], ''\"Doctor of <...> Sciences\"'', requires many years of research experience, and writing of a second dissertation. Obtaining [[Doktor nauk]] degree is usually associated with approval for a professorial position in Russian universities, while holders of [[Kandidat]] degree are rarely allowed to hold this administrative post. The degrees of Kandidat and Doktor of Sciences are only awarded by the special governmental agency ([[Higher Attestation Commission]]); only the university or scientific institute where the thesis was defended can recommend the award of this degree to candidates.\n---->\n\n===Russia===\nIn the [[Russian Empire]] the academic degree \"doctor of the sciences\" (''[[doktor nauk]]'') marked the highest academic degree that can be achieved by an examination. (The \"doctor nauk\" degree was introduced in Russia in 1819, abolished in 1917, and revived in the [[USSR]] in 1934.)<ref>Leitenberg, Milton and Raymond A. Zilinskas (2012), ''The Soviet Biological Weapons Program: A History'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2012, Table 2.1.</ref> This system was generally adopted by the [[USSR]]/[[Russia]] and many post-Soviet countries. A lower degree, \"[[Candidate of Sciences|candidate [doctor] of the sciences]]\" (''kandidat nauk''; first introduced in the USSR on January 13, 1934, by a decision of the [[Sovnarkom|Council of People's Commissars of the USSR]]), is, roughly, the Russian equivalent to the research doctorate in other countries.\n\n===Spain===\n[[File:Birrete doctoral.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The ancient ceremony of bestowing [[Complutense]]'s Doctoral ''[[biretta]]''.]]\nDoctoral degrees are regulated by Royal Decree (R.D. 778/1998),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upm.es/laupm/organos_gobierno/normativa/NormativaDoctorado0203.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216045313/http://www.upm.es/laupm/organos_gobierno/normativa/NormativaDoctorado0203.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-16 }}</ref> ''Real Decreto'' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).

A minimum of 4 years of study is required, divided into 2 stages:\n\n* A 2-year (or longer) period of studies concludes with a public dissertation presented to a panel of 3 Professors. Upon approval from the university, the candidate receives a \"Diploma de Estudios Avanzados\" (part qualified doctor, equivalent to M.Sc.). From 2008 it is possible to substitute the former diploma by a recognized master program.\n* A 2-year (or longer) research period includes extensions for up to 10 years. The student must present a thesis describing a discovery or original contribution. If approved by their thesis director, the study is presented to a panel of 5 distinguished scholars. Any Doctor attending the public defense is allowed to challenge the candidate with questions. If approved, the candidate receives the doctorate. Four marks used to be granted: Unsatisfactory (''Suspenso''), Pass (''Aprobado''), Remarkable (''Notable''), \"Cum laude\" (''Sobresaliente''), and \"Summa cum laude\" (''Sobresaliente Cum Laude'').

Votes are verified by the university. A unanimous vote of the reviewers nominates Doctors granted ''Apto Cum Laude'' for an \"Extraordinary Award\" (''Premio Extraordinario de Doctorado'').\n\nIn the same Royal Decree the initial 3-year study period was replaced by a Research master's degree (one or two years; Professional master's degrees do not grant direct access to Ph.D. Programs) that concludes with a public dissertation called \"Trabajo de Fin de M\u00e1ster\" or \"Proyecto de Fin de M\u00e1ster\".

UK doctorates are categorised as:<ref name=\"QAA Doctorate\"/>\n;Junior doctorates\n:# ''Subject specialist doctorates'' \u2013 normally PhD/DPhil; the most common form of doctorate\n:#* ''Integrated subject specialist doctorates'' \u2013 integrated PhDs including teaching at master's level \n:# ''Doctorates by publication'' \u2013 PhD by Published Works; only awarded infrequently\n:# ''Professional and practice-based (or practitioner) doctorates'' \u2013 e.g. EdD, ProfDoc/DProf, EngD, etc.; usually include taught elements and have a professional, rather than academic, orientation\n;Higher doctorates: e.g. DD, LLD, DSc, DLitt; higher level than junior doctorates, usually awarded either for a substantial body of work over an extended period or as honorary degrees.\n\nThe [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education|Quality Assurance Agency]] states in the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies (which covers junior doctorates but not higher doctorates) that:<ref name=FHEQ/>\n{{Quotation|text='''Doctoral degrees are awarded to students who have demonstrated:'''\n* the creation and interpretation of new knowledge, through original research or other advanced scholarship, of a quality to satisfy peer review, extend the forefront of the discipline, and merit publication\n* a systematic acquisition and understanding of a substantial body of knowledge which is at the forefront of an academic discipline or area of professional practice\n* the general ability to conceptualise, design and implement a project for the generation of new knowledge, applications or understanding at the forefront of the discipline, and to adjust the project design in the light of unforeseen problems\n* a detailed understanding of applicable techniques for research and advanced academic enquiry}}\n\nIn the UK, the (junior) doctorate is a qualification awarded at FHEQ level 8/level 12 of the FQHEIS on the [[National qualifications frameworks in the United Kingdom|national qualifications frameworks]].<ref name=FHEQ/><ref name=\"QAA Doctorate\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/help-and-advice/comparing-qualifications/|title=Compare different qualifications|work=ofqual.gov.uk|access-date=2012-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116181912/http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/help-and-advice/comparing-qualifications/|archive-date=2013-01-16|url-status=dead}}</ref> The higher doctorates are stated to be \"A higher level of award\", which is not covered by the qualifications frameworks.<ref name=\"QAA Doctorate\"/>\n\n====Subject specialist doctorates====\n\nThese are the most common doctorates in the UK and are normally awarded as PhDs. While the master/apprentice model was traditionally used for British PhDs, since 2003 courses have become more structured, with students taking courses in research skills and receiving training for professional and personal development. However, the assessment of the PhD remains based on the production of a thesis or equivalent and its defence at a ''[[oral exam|viva voce]]'' oral examination, normally held in front of at least two examiners, one internal and one external.<ref name=\"QAA Doctorate\"/> Access to PhDs normally requires an [[British degree classification|upper second class or first class]] [[bachelor's degree]], or a [[master's degree]]. Courses normally last three years, although it is common for students to be initially registered for [[MPhil]] degrees and then formally transferred onto the PhD after a year or two.

Typically the candidate submits a collection of previously published, peer-refereed work, which is reviewed by a committee of internal and external academics who decide whether the candidate deserves the doctorate. The higher doctorate is similar in some respects to the [[habilitation]] in some European countries. However, the purpose of the award is significantly different. While the habilitation formally determines whether an academic is suitably qualified to be a university professor, the higher doctorate does not qualify the holder for a position but rather recognises their contribution to research.<ref name=\"higher doctorates 2013\"/>\n\nHigher doctorates were defined by the UK Council for Graduate Education (UKCGE) in 2013 as:<ref name=\"higher doctorates 2013\"/>\n{{quote|an award that is at a level above the PhD (or equivalent professional doctorate in the discipline), and that is typically gained not through a defined programme of study but rather by submission of a substantial body of research-based work.}}\n\nIn terms of number of institutions offering the awards, the most common doctorates of this type in UKCGE surveys carried out in 2008 and 2013 were the [[Doctor of Science]] (DSc), [[Doctor of Letters]] (DLitt), [[Doctor of Law]] (LLD), [[Doctor of Music]] (DMus) and [[Doctor of Divinity]] (DD); in the 2008 survey the [[Doctor of Technology]] (DTech) tied with the DD.<ref name=\"higher doctorates 2013\"/> The DSc was offered by all 49 responding institutions in 2008 and 15 out of 16 in 2013 and the DLitt by only one less in each case, while the DD was offered in 10 responding institutions in 2008 and 3 in 2013. In terms of number of higher doctorates awarded (not including honorary doctorates) the DSc was most popular, but the number of awards was very low: the responding institutions had averaged an award of at most one earned higher doctorate per year over the period 2003\u20132013.<ref name=\"higher doctorates 2013\"/>\n\n====Honorary degrees====\nMost British universities award degrees ''honoris causa'' to recognise individuals who have made a substantial contribution to a particular field. Usually an appropriate higher doctorate is used in these circumstances, depending on the candidate's achievements. However, some universities differentiate between honorary and substantive doctorates, using the degree of [[Doctor of the University]] (D.Univ.) for these purposes, and reserve the higher doctorates for formal academic research.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Woolsey Hall, Yale University.jpg|thumb|In 1861, [[Yale University]] awarded the first [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)]] degree in the United States.]]\n\nThe structure of US doctoral programs is more formal and complex than some others. US research doctorates are awarded for successfully completing and defending independent research presented in the form of a dissertation, along with advanced study. Multiple professional degrees use the term \"doctor\" in their title, such as [[Juris Doctor]] and [[Doctor of Medicine]], but these degrees do not always contain an independent research component or always require a dissertation and should not be confused with Ph.D./D.Phil./[[Doctor of Education|Ed.D./D.Ed.]] degrees or other research doctorates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/professional.doc |format=DOC |title=Credential Creep |website=2.ed.gov |accessdate=2016-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823140419/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/professional.doc |archive-date=2016-08-23 |url-status=live }}</ref> Law school graduates, although awarded the J.D. degree, are not normally addressed as \"doctor\".  In legal studies the Ph.D. equivalent is the much rarer [[Doctor of Juridical Science]].\n\nMany universities offer Ph.D./D.Phil. followed by a professional doctorate or joint Ph.D./D.Phil. with the professional degree.

One of his distasteful acts was his desire to take his own half sisters, Gitarja and Rajadewi, as wives. Since Javanese tradition abhorred the practice of half siblings marrying, the council of royal elders spoke strongly against the king's wishes. It was not clear what motivated Jayanegara's wish \u2013 it might have been his way to ensure his claim to the throne by preventing rivals from being his half sisters' suitors, although in the later period of the Majapahit court the custom of marriage among cousins was quite common. In the ''[[Pararaton]]'', he was known as ''Kala Gemet'', or \"weak villain\". About the time of Jayanegara's reign, the Italian Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] visited the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nIn 1328, Jayanegara was murdered by his physician, Tanca, during a surgical operation. In complete mayhem and rage, Gajah Mada immediately killed Tanca. The motive behind this [[regicide]] was never clear. According to the ''Pararaton'', it was Tanca's revenge for the king sexually abusing his wife.

After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses.

These Chinese voyages visited numbers of ports in Asia as far as [[Africa]], including Majapahit ports. It was said that Zheng He has paid a visit to the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nThese massive Chinese voyages were not merely a naval exploration, but also a show of power and a display of geopolitical reach. The Chinese Ming dynasty had recently overthrown the Mongols Yuan dynasty, and were eager to establish their hegemony in the world, which changed the geopolitical balance in Asia.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\">{{cite news | title = History of Indian Ocean shows how old rivalries can trigger rise of new forces | work = Times of India | date = 6 August 2016 | author = Sanjeev Sanyal | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/History-of-Indian-Ocean-shows-how-old-rivalries-can-trigger-rise-of-new-forces/articleshow/53577849.cms}}</ref> Chinese intervened in the politics of the southern seas by supporting Thais against the declining Khmer Empire, support and installing allied factions in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and other places in [[Indian Ocean]] coasts. However, perhaps the most significant Chinese intervention was its support for the newly established [[Sultanate of Malacca]], as a rival and counter-weight to the Majapahit influence of Java.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" /> \n\nPreviously, Majapahit has succeeded to assert its influence in Malacca strait by containing the aspiration of Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula to ever reach the geopolitical might like those of Srivijaya. The Hindu Majapahit were the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming's support for Malacca, and the spread of Islam propagated by both Malacca and Zheng He's treasure fleet has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in Sumatra, which caused the northern part of the island to increasingly converting to Islam and gained independence from Majapahit, leaving [[Indragiri]], [[Jambi]] and [[Palembang]], remnants of the old [[Srivijaya]], the only suzerainty under Majapahit in Sumatra,{{efn | group=lower-roman | According to the History of Ming, only these areas in Sumatra were still mentioned as under Javanese / Majapahit supremacy at the time. Read <ref name=\"notes on the malay archipelago\" />}} bordering [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] on the west and independent Muslim kingdoms on the north.\n\nThis Ming dynasty voyages is extremely important for Majapahit historiography, since Zheng He's translator [[Ma Huan]] wrote ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'', a detailed description of Majapahit,<ref name=\"yingyai\" /> which provides a valuable insight on the culture, customs, also various social and economic aspects of Java during Majapahit period.<ref name=\"Chao-Wa\" />\n\nThe Chinese provided systematic support to Malacca, and its sultan made at least one trip to personally pay obeisance to the Ming emperor. Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to [[Islam]] in the region, while Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in coastal northern Java, thus created a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as [[Semarang]], [[Demak, Indonesia|Demak]], [[Tuban]], and [[Surabaya|Ampel]]; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java. Malacca prospered under Chinese Ming protection, while the Majapahit were steadily pushed back.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" />\n\n====Queen Suhita====\n[[File:Suhita.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The mortuary deified portrait statue of Queen [[Suhita]] (reign 1429-1447), discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java, [[National Museum of Indonesia]].]]\nWikramawardhana ruled until 1426 and was succeeded by his daughter [[Suhita]],<ref name=\"Coedes\" />{{rp|242}} who ruled from 1426 to 1447. She was the second child of Wikramawardhana by a concubine who was the daughter of Wirabhumi. The reign of Suhita was the second time Majapahit was reigned by a queen regnant after her great grandmother Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi. Her reign is immortalized in Javanese legend of [[Damarwulan]], as it involves a maiden queen named Prabu Kenya in the story, and during Suhita's reign there was a war with [[Blambangan]] as stated in the legend.<ref>Claire Holt. ''Art in Indonesia: Continuities and Change''.

After Kertawijaya died, [[Bhre Pamotan]] became a king with formal name Rajasawardhana. He died in 1453. A three-year kingless period was possibly the result of a succession crisis. [[Girisawardhana]], son of Kertawijaya, came to power in 1456. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by Singhawikramawardhana.\n\n====The divide====\nIn 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against Singhawikramawardhana, promoting himself as the king of Majapahit. Deposed Singhawikramawardhana retreated upstream of Brantas River, moved the kingdom's capital further inland to [[Kediri (city)|Daha]] (the former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]]), effectively splitting Majapahit, under Bhre Kertabumi in Trowulan and Singhawikramawardhana in Daha. Singhawikramawardhana continued his rule until he was succeeded by his son [[Girindrawardhana]] (Ranawijaya) in 1474.\n\nAnd in between this period of the dividing court of Majapahit, the kingdom found itself unable to control its western part of the already crumbling empire. The rising power of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] began to gain effective control of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] in the mid-15th century and expanding its influence to Sumatra. And amidst these events, Indragiri and Siantan, according to [[Malay Annals]] were given to Malacca as a dowry for the marriage of a Majapahit princess and the [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|sultan of Malacca]].<ref name=\"Leyden\">Leyden, John (1821)[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=J9JAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Malay Annals (translated from the Malay language)], Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown.</ref>, further weakening Majapahit's influence on the western part of the archipelago. Kertabhumi managed to stabilized this situation by allying with Muslim merchants, giving them trading rights on the north coast of Java, with [[Demak Regency|Demak]] as its centre and in return asked for their loyalty to Majapahit. This policy boosted the Majapahit treasury and power, but weakened Hindu-Buddhism as its main religion because [[Dawah|Islamic proselytizing]] spread faster, especially in Javanese coastal principalities. Hindu-Buddhist followers' grievances later paved the way for Ranawijaya to defeat Kertabumi.\n\n[[Image:Muzium Negara KL38.JPG|thumb|right|The model of a Majapahit ship display in [[Muzium Negara]], [[Kuala Lumpur]].

This event led to the war between the [[Sultanate of Demak]] and [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Daha]], since Demak rulers were descendants of Kertabhumi.\n\nDuring this period of Majapahit's retreat to the inland [[Kediri|Daha]] and war in Java, [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]], being the dominant ruler of the Javanese coastal lands and Java as a whole, seized the region of Jambi and Palembang in Sumatra from Majapahit.<ref name=\":3\" />{{rp|154\u2013155}}\n\n====Demak invasion and the fall of Majapahit====\n[[File:Masjid Agung Demak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] was the earliest Islamic polity in Java that replaced Majapahit.]]\nIn 1498, there was a turning point when Girindrawardhana was deposed by his vice regent, Udara. After this coup, the war between Demak and Daha receded, with some sources saying [[Raden Patah]], Sultan of Demak, left Majapahit alone as his father had done before, while others said Udara agreed to become a vassal of Demak, even marrying Raden Patah's youngest daughter.\n\nMeanwhile in the west, [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Malacca was captured by Portuguese in 1511]].

The refugees fled to the east to avoid Demak retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi. \n\nDemak came under the leadership of Raden (later crowned as Sultan) Patah (Arabic name: Fatah, lit. \"liberator\", \"conqueror\"), who was acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Majapahit. According to Babad Tanah Jawi and Demak tradition, the source of Patah's legitimacy was because their first sultan, Raden Patah, was the son of Majapahit king Brawijaya V with a Chinese concubine. Another argument supports Demak as the successor of Majapahit; the rising Demak sultanate was easily accepted as the nominal regional ruler, as Demak was the former Majapahit vassal and located near the former Majapahit realm in Eastern Java.\n\nDemak established itself as the regional power and the first Islamic sultanate in Java. After the fall of Majapahit, the Hindu kingdoms in Java only remained in [[Blambangan]] on the eastern edge and [[Sunda Kingdom|Pajajaran]] in the western part. Gradually [[Hindu]] communities began to retreat to the mountain ranges in East Java and also to the neighbouring island of [[Bali]]. A small enclave of [[Tenggerese people|Hindu communities]] still remain in the [[Tengger caldera|Tengger]] mountain range.\n\n== Military ==\nAccording to History of Yuan, soldiers of early Majapahit era were mainly dominated by poorly equipped light [[infantry]]. During the Mongol invasion of Java, Javanese army was described as temporarily mobilized farmers and a few noble warriors. The nobility marched at the front line, with huge rear army composed of peasants. The Javanese peasant army was half-naked and covered with cotton fabric at the waist ([[sarung]]). Most of the weapons are bows and arrows, [[bamboo]] spears, and short blades.

In his book: \"Travels of Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]]\", he visited several places in today's Indonesia: [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], and [[Banjarmasin]] in Borneo, between 1318\u20131330. He was sent by the Pope to launch a mission into the Asian interiors. In 1318 he departed from [[Padua]], crossed the [[Black Sea]] into [[Persia]], all the way across [[Calcutta]], [[Madras]], and [[Sri Lanka]]. He then headed to [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]] island all the way to Sumatra, before visiting Java and Banjarmasin. He returned to Italy by land through [[Vietnam]], [[China]], all the way through the [[silkroad]] to Europe in 1330.\n\nIn his book he mentioned that he visited Java without explaining the exact place he had visited.

Unlike the earlier naturalistic, relaxed and flowing figures of classical Central Java style ([[Sailendra]] art c. 8th to 10th century), this East Javanese style demonstrates a stiffer pose, stylised and rendered in [[wayang]]-like figures, such as those carved on East Javanese temple's bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs were projected rather flat from the background. This style was later preserved in [[Balinese art]], especially in its [[Kamasan]] style classical paintings and Balinese wayang.\n\nThe statues of Hindu gods and Buddhist deities in Majapahit art were also the continuisation of its previous Singhasari art. The statues of East Javanese period tends to be stiffer and frontal-formal pose, compared to the statues of Central Javanese art (c. 9th century) that are more Indianized style, relaxed in [[tribhanga]] pose. The stiffer pose of Majapahit gods statues are probably in accordance to the statue's function as the deified portrayal self of the dead Majapahit monarch. The carving however, are richly decorated, especially with fine floral carving of lotus plants carved on the stela behind the statue. Examples of Majapahit statues are the Harihara statue from Simping temple, believed to be the deified portrayal of [[Raden Wijaya|King Kertarajasa]], the statue of Parwati believed to be the portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Queen Tribhuwana]], and statue of queen [[Suhita]] discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java.\n\n[[File:Pair of door guardians SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Pair of door guardians from a temple, Eastern Java, 14th century, [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Museum of Asian Art, San Francisco]].]]\n\nClay pottery and brick masonry are popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture. The [[Majapahit Terracotta]] art also flourished in this period. Significant numbers of [[terracotta]] artefacts were discovered in [[Trowulan]]. The artefacts ranges from human and animal figurines, jars, vessels, water containers, [[piggy bank]]s, bas reliefs, architectural ornaments, roof pinnacles, floor tiles, to pipes and roof tiles. One of the most interesting findings is Majapahit piggy bank. Several boar-shaped piggy banks has been discovered in Trowulan. It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word ''celengan'' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] means both \"savings\" and \"piggy bank\". It was derived from the word ''celeng'' which means \"wild boar\", the [[suffix]] \"-an\" was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large piggy bank has been found broken to pieces.\n\nTerracotta money boxes also has been found in different shapes, such as tubular or boxes, with slits to slip coins. Another important terracotta artefact is the head figurine of a man popularly thought to be the depiction of Gajah Mada, although it is not certain about who was depicted in these figurines.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jabung]] temple near Paiton, Probolinggo, East Java, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n\nIn his book ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan also describes the Majapahit cities: most of them do not have walls surrounding the city or the suburbs. He describes the king's palace in Majapahit. The king's residence is surrounded with thick red brick walls more than three ''[[zhang (unit)|chang]]'' high (about {{convert|30.5|ft|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}), with length of more than 200 paces ({{convert|340|yd|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and on the wall there are two layers of gates, the palace is very well guarded and clean. The king's palace was a two-storey building, each of them 3 or 4 ''chang'' high ({{convert|9\u201314.5|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}). It had wooden plank floors and exposed mats made from rattan or reeds (presumably palm leaves), where people sat cross-legged. The roof was made of hardwood shingles (Javanese:''sirap'') laid as tiles.<ref name=yingyai />\n\nThe houses of commoners had thatched roofs ([[nipa palm]] leaves). Every family has a storage shed made of bricks, about 3 or 4 ''[[Chi (unit)|Ch'ih]]'' ({{convert|48.9|in|cm|abbr=off|disp=or}}) above the ground, where they kept the family property, and they lived on top of this building, to sit and sleep.\n\nThe Majapahit temple architecture follows the east Javanese styles, in contrast of earlier central Javanese style. This east Javanese temple style is also dated back from Kediri period c. 11th century. The shapes of Majapahit temples are tends to be slender and tall, with roof constructed from multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure curved upward smoothly creating the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective illussion]] that the temple is perceived taller than its actual height. The pinnacle of the temples are usually cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples). Although some of temples dated from Majapahit period used [[andesite]] or [[sandstone]], the red [[brick]]s is also a popular construction material.\n\n[[File:Bajang Ratu Gate Trowulan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The 16.5-metre tall Bajang Ratu [[Paduraksa]] gate, at Trowulan, echoed the grandeur of Majapahit.]]\n\nAlthough [[brick]] had been used in the ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was Majapahit architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|author=Schoppert, P., Damais, S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in Trowulan, [[Pari Temple|Pari]] in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo, and [[Candi Surawana|Surawana temple]] near Kediri. Jabung temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Bajrajinaparamitapura, despite some parts of its roof and pinnacles are now missing, it is one of the most well-preserved Majapahit temple architecture. Another example include Gunung Gangsir temple near Pasuruan. Some of the temples are dated from earlier period but renovated and expanded during Majapahit era, such as [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], the largest temple in East Java dated back to [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] era. This temple was identified in Nagarakretagama as Palah temple and reported being visited by King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. Another notable temple of Eastern Javanese style is [[Jawi temple]] in Pandaan \u2013 also visited by King Hayam Wuruk, the temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Jajawa, and was dedicated as mortuary temple for his great grandfather, King Kertanegara of Singhasari.\n\nSome of typical architectural style are believed to be developed during Majapahit era; such as tall and slender roofed red brick gate commonly called as ''kori agung'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'', and also split gate of ''[[candi bentar]]''. The large split gate of Wringin Lawang located at Jatipasar, Trowulan, Mojokerto, East Java, is one of the oldest and the largest surviving ''candi bentar'' dated from Majapahit era. The ''candi bentar'' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure \u2013 consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof \u2013 evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the centre for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound through tall roof ''paduraksa'' gate with enclosed door. The example of ''kori agung'' or ''paduraksa'' style gate is the elegant Bajang Ratu gate richly decorated with Kala demon, cyclops and also the bas-relief telling the story of Sri Tanjung. Those typical Majapahit architectural style has deeply influenced the Javanese and [[Balinese architecture]] of later period. The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates, was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\">{{cite book | title = Majapahit Style Vol.1 | author = Made Wijaya | publisher = Wijaya Words - a division of Yayasan Beringin Berapi| year = 2014 | isbn = 9786027136700| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Majapahit_Style_Vol_1.html?id=J3GMBAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>\n\nIn later period near the fall of Majapahit, the art and architecture of Majapahit witnessed the revival of indigenous native Austronesian [[megalithic architectural elements]], such as [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples on western slopes of [[Mount Lawu]]. Unlike previous Majapahit temples that demonstrate typical Hindu architecture of high-rise towering structure, the shape of these temples are [[step pyramid]], quite similar to Mesoamerican [[pyramid]]s. The stepped pyramid structure called ''Punden Berundak'' (stepped mounds) is a common megalithic structure during [[Prehistoric Indonesia|Indonesian prehistoric era]] before the adoption of Hindu-Buddhist culture.\n\n==Economy==\nAlso in ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan reported the Javanese economy and market.

Previously, the 9th-century [[Wonoboyo hoard]] discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40&nbsp;kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in [[Sidoarjo]] in November 2008.

This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited.<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} These ''kepeng'' Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes\u2014the imported Chinese copper coins\u2014enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped ''celengan'' (piggy bank).\n\nSome idea of scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java).<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silver smiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non-agrarian pursuits seems to have become even greater during the Majapahit era.\n\nThe great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice [[Tillage|cultivation]], and during Majapahit's prime numerous [[irrigation]] projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided an important source of income for Majapahit.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nThe Nagarakretagama states that the fame of the ruler of Wilwatikta (a synonym for Majapahit) attracted foreign merchants from far and wide, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese among others. While in later period, ''Yingya Shenglan'' mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from west (from Arab and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and Malay peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh ([[Surabaya]]). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], [[Vietnam|Annam]] and [[Champa]] in today Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]], Burmese [[Martaban]] and the south Indian [[Vijayanagara Empire]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{multiple image|align=right| direction = vertical|total_width=150|image1=Surya Majapahit.jpg|image2=Surya Majapahit 2.jpg|image3=Candi Ceto Majapahit Sun, Surakarta 1264.jpg|footer=Three designs of [[Surya Majapahit]], the sun emblem of the kingdom.}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]], Majapahit employed a well-organised bureaucratic structure for administrative purposes. The hierarchy and structure relatively remain intact and unchanged throughout Majapahit history.<ref name=\"SNI451\">Poesponegoro & Notosusanto (1990), hal. 451\u2013456.</ref> The king is the paramount ruler, as the [[chakravartin]] he is considered as the universal ruler and believed to be the living god on earth. The king holds the highest political authority and legitimacy.\n\n===Bureaucracy officials===\nDuring his daily administration, the king is assisted by bureaucratic state officials that also included the close relatives of the kings that hold certain esteemed titles. The royal order or edict usually transmitted from the king to the high officials well to their subordinates. The officials in Majapahit courts are:\n:* ''Rakryan Mahamantri Katrini'', usually reserved for the king's heir\n:* ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'', the board of [[Minister (government)|ministers]] that conduct the daily administration\n:* ''Dharmmadhyaksa'', the officials of laws, state laws as well as religious laws\n:* ''Dharmma-upapatti'', the officials concerning religious affairs\n\nWithin the ministers of ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'' there is the most important and the highest minister titled ''Rakryan Mapatih'' or ''Patih Hamangkubhumi''. This position is analogous to [[prime minister]], and together with king, they determine the important state policies, including war or peace. Among the Dharmmadhyaksa officials there is ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasewan'' (State's highest Hindu [[Shivaist]] priest) and ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasogatan'' (State's highest Buddhist priest), both are the religious laws authorities of each dharmic faiths.\n\nThere is also the board of advisors which consists of the elders within royal family called ''Bhattara Saptaprabhu''. This council consists of seven influential elders\u2014mostly directly related to the king. They are the ''Bhres'' (Duke or Duchess) acted as regional kings, the rulers of Majapahit provinces. This council congregates, offers advice, gave consideration to the king, and often formed an assembly to judge a certain important case in the court. Example of their office was, their sentence to temporarily suspend Mahamantri Gajah Mada, as a punishment since he was held responsible for the shamefully disastrous [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat incident]]. The council also sentenced the execution of Raden Gajah (Narapati) for decapitating Bhre Wirabhumi in [[Paregreg war]].<ref name=\"BP-Sejarah Nasional\">{{cite book | title = Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Zaman kuno \u2013 Volume 2 dari Sejarah nasional Indonesia | author1= Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro | author2= Soejono (R.

This region is ruled by provincial kings called ''Paduka Bhattara'' with the title ''Bhre''. This title is the highest position below the monarch and similar to duke or duchess. Usually this position reserved for the close relatives of the king. Their duty is to administer their own provinces, collect taxes, send annual tributes to the capital, and manage the defences of their borders.\n\nDuring the reign of Hayam Wuruk (1350\u20131389) there were 12 provinces of Majapahit, administered by king's close relatives:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" width=\"80%\"\n! width=\"260\" |Provinces\n! width=\"120\" |Titles\n! width=\"140\" |Rulers\n! width=\"260\" |Relation to the King\n|-\n|[[Kahuripan]] (or [[Janggala]], today [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo]])\n|Bhre Kahuripan\n|Tribhuwanatunggadewi\n|queen mother\n|-\n|Daha (former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]])\n|Bhre Daha\n|Rajadewi Maharajasa\n|aunt and also mother-in-law\n|-\n|Tumapel (former capital of [[Singhasari]])\n|Bhre Tumapel\n|Kertawardhana\n|father\n|-\n|Wengker (today [[Ponorogo]])\n|Bhre Wengker\n|Wijayarajasa\n|uncle and also father-in-law\n|-\n|Matahun (today [[Bojonegoro]])\n|Bhre Matahun\n|Rajasawardhana\n|husband of the duchess of Lasem, king's cousin\n|-\n|Wirabhumi ([[Blambangan]])\n|Bhre Wirabhumi\n|Bhre Wirabhumi{{efn | group=lower-roman | 1=Bhre Wirabhumi is actually the title: the Duke of Wirabhumi (Blambangan), the real name is unknown.

The traditional or initial area of Majapahit during its formation before entering the imperial phase. This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of capital, all the way to [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] port (Surabaya) are considered as parts of ''Negara Agung''.\n* '''''Mancanegara''''', areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' \u2014 traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture, and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their own rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of [[Java]] island, [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. However, in later period, overseas provinces which has developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered as ''mancanegara''. Either the province has their own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].\n* '''''Nusantara''''', areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in [[Malay peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n[[File:Filippine, provincia di agusan, immagine hindu, statuetta in oro massiccio, xiii secolo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A 1.79 kilogram, 21-karat Majapahit period [[Golden Tara|gold image]] discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan|Agusan]], [[Philippines]], copied Nganjuk bronze images of the early Majapahit period,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/view/item/7096|title=[Bronze statues from Nganjuk] OD-3577 {{!}} Digital Collections|website=digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> signify Majapahit cultural influence on southern Philippines.]]\n\n[[Nagarakretagama#Descriptions of the Majapahit realm|Nagarakretagama]] mentioned more than 80 places in the archipelago described as the vassal states.<ref name=\"Britannica-Majapahit\"/> In Canto 13, several lands on [[Sumatra]] are mentioned, and some possibly correspond to contemporary areas: [[Jambi]], [[Palembang]], Teba ([[Toba Samosir Regency|Toba]]), and [[Dharmasraya]].

Since early of its formation, Majapahit inherited the foreign outlook of its predecessor \u2013 [[Singhasari]], in which its last king [[Kertanegara]] projected his influence abroad by launching [[Pamalayu]] expedition to incorporate Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula within Javanese sphere of influence. Previously, Singhasari seeks to dominate trade route, especially Malacca strait, and also saw the outreach of Mongolian-Chinese Yuan influence into Southeast Asia as the threat of their own realm.\n\nDuring its formation, the returning Pamalayu expedition has brought Malayu Kingdoms in Jambi and Dharmasraya under Javanese suzerainty. Therefore, Java often seen itself as the overlord of most of polities in the Indonesian archipelago. In Sumatran front, Majapahit did capture Palembang, Jambi and Dharmasraya, invade Pasai, and it also saw the settlement of [[Temasek|Tumasik]], that later become [[Kingdom of Singapura]], as its rebellious colony, and thus deal with them accordingly.\n\nDuring the reign of Majapahit's first two monarch \u2013 Wijaya and Jayanegara, the kingdom struggled to consolidate its rule, plagued by number of rebellions. However, it was not until the reign of its third monarch \u2013 Queen Tribhuwana, and her son, Hayam Wuruk \u2013 that the kingdom began to projected its power overseas. Majapahit's confidence for dominance was stemmed for their economic and demographic comparative advantage; agrarian as well as maritime nation; their immense rice production and human resources, also their mastery in shipbuilding and military technology, compared to its neighbours. These strenght was used by Gajah Mada to expand the kingdom's influence. This rather imperialistic outlooks, has projected in the way he forcefully dealt with Majapahit's neighbours; the Pabali (conquest of Bali) and the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]]. Majapahit pulled Bali into their orbit as a vassal state. While the disasterous diplomacy with Sunda kingdom has led to the enmity among them.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Pura Maospahit Denpasar Bali.jpg|thumb|right|''Pura Maospahit'' (\"Majapahit Temple\") in [[Denpasar]], Bali, demonstrate the typical Majapahit red brick architecture.]]\n\nMajapahit was the largest empire ever to form in Southeast Asia.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}} Although its political power beyond the core area in east Java was diffuse, constituting mainly ceremonial recognition of suzerainty, Majapahit society developed a high degree of sophistication in both commercial and artistic activities. Its capital was inhabited by a cosmopolitan population among whom literature and art flourished.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nNumbers of local legends and [[folklore]]s in the region had mentioned about the Majapahit kingdom. Other than Javanese sources, some regional legends mentioning Majapahit kingdom or its general Gajah Mada, also can be found; from Aceh, Minangkabau, Palembang, Malay Peninsula, Sunda, Brunei, Bali to Sumbawa. Most of them mentioned about the incoming Javanese forces to their land, which was probably a local testament of the empire's expansive nature that once dominating the archipelago. The [[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai|Hikayat Raja Pasai]], a 14th-century [[Aceh]] chronicle tell a Majapahit naval invasion against [[Samudra Pasai]] in 1350.

The [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycles]], the tale of [[Sri Tanjung]], and the epic of [[Damarwulan]], are popular tales in Javanese and [[Balinese literature]]s. The tales of Panji was dated from older period during Kediri kingdom, while the tale of Sri Tanjung and the epic of Damarwulan took place during Majapahit period. These tales remained a popular theme in Javanese culture of later period during Mataram Sultanate, and often became the source of inspiration for [[wayang]] shadow puppet performance, [[ketoprak]] and [[topeng]] dance drama. The Panji tales in particular have spread from East Java to become a source of inspiration for literature and dance drama throughout the region, as far as Malay peninsula, Cambodia and Siam where he is known as Raden Inao or Enau ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32}}) of Kurepan.{{Sfn|Holt|1967|p=274}}\n\nMajapahit had a momentous and lasting influence on [[Indonesian art]] and [[Indonesian architecture|architecture]]. The empire's expansion circa 14th-century, contributed to the difussion Javanese cultural influence throughout the archipelago, which can be seen as a form of [[Javanisation]]. It was probably during this period that some of Javanese cultural elements, such as [[gamelan]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-gamelan-195131|title=Learn the History Behind Gamelan, Indonesian Music and Dance|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref> and kris, being expanded and introduced to islands outside of Java. The descriptions of the architecture of the capital's pavilions (''[[pendopo]]'') in the ''Nagarakretagama'' evoke the Javanese [[Kraton (Indonesia)|Kraton]] also the [[Pura (Balinese temple)|Balinese temples]] and palace compounds of today. The Majapahit architectural style that often employs [[Majapahit Terracotta|terracotta]] and [[red brick]] heavily influenced the architecture of Java and Bali in the later period. The Majapahit style ''[[candi bentar]]'' split gate, the ''kori'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'' towering red brick gate, and also ''pendopo'' pavilion have become ubiquitous in Javanese and Balinese architectural features, as seen in [[Menara Kudus Mosque]], [[Keraton Kasepuhan]] and Sunyaragi park in [[Cirebon]], [[Mataram Sultanate]] royal cemetery in [[Kota Gede]], [[Yogyakarta]], and various palaces and temples in Bali.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\"/>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebfs op het Pendopo Terras Panataran tempelcomplex TMnr 20027152.jpg|thumb|right|Bas relief from [[Candi Penataran]] describes the Javanese-style [[pendopo]] pavilion, commonly found across Java and Bali.]]\n\nThe vivid, rich and festive [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]] is considered as one of Majapahit legacy.

The aesthetics and style of bas-reliefs in Majapahit East Javanese temples were preserved and copied in Balinese temples. It is also due to the fact that after the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests had taken refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java or across the narrow strait to Bali. Indeed, in some ways the [[Bali Kingdom|Kingdom of Bali]] was the successor of Majapahit. Large numbers of Majapahit manuscripts, such as [[Nagarakretagama]], [[Kakawin Sutasoma|Sutasoma]], [[Pararaton]] and [[Tantu Pagelaran]], were being well-kept in royal libraries of Bali and Lombok, and provides the glimpse and valuable historical records on Majapahit. The Majapahit Hindu-Javanese culture has shaped the culture of Bali, that led to popular expression; \"without Java there is no Bali\". Yet in return, Bali is credited as the last stronghold to safeguard and preserve the ancient Hindu Javanese civilisation.\n\n[[File:WLANL - mchangsp - Kris van Knaud.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to Majapahit period]]\n\nIn weaponry, the Majapahit expansion is believed to be responsible for the widespread use of the [[Kris|keris]] dagger in Southeast Asia; from Java, Bali, Sumatra, Malaysia, Brunei to Southern Thailand. Although it has been suggested that the keris, and native daggers similar to it, predate Majapahit, nevertheless the empire expansion contributed to its popularity and diffusion in the region around the year 1492.<ref name=\"JPostKris\">{{cite news|title=Kris, more than just a simple dagger |author=Tantri Yuliandini |date=18 April 2002 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/04/18/kris-more-just-a-simple-dagger.html |accessdate=30 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729203644/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/04/18/kris-more-just-a-simple-dagger.html |archivedate=29 July 2014 }}</ref> For example, [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to 1264 Saka (which correspondends to 1342).

The Indonesian Navy flag of red and white stripes also has a Majapahit origin.

This ancient oath of unification signifies the Palapa satellite as the modern means to unify the Indonesian archipelago by way of [[telecommunication]].

The history of Majapahit continues to inspire contemporary artists.]]\nCelebrated as 'the golden era of the archipelago', the Majapahit empire has inspired many writers and artists (and continues to do so) to create their works based on this era, or to describe and mention it. The impact of the Majapahit theme on popular culture can be seen in the following:\n\n# ''Sandyakalaning Majapahit'' (1933), or Twilight/Sunset in Majapahit is an historical romance that took place during the fall of Majapahit empire, written by [[Sanusi Pane]].\n# ''Panji Koming'' (since 1979), a weekly [[comic strip]] by Dwi Koendoro published in the Sunday edition of [[Kompas]], telling the everyday life of Panji Koming, a common Majapahit citizen. Although it took place in the Majapahit era, the comic strip serves as witty [[satire]] and [[criticism]] of modern Indonesian society. From a political, social, cultural and current point of view, Indonesia is described as the '[[reincarnation]]' of the Majapahit empire. The current Indonesian president is often portrayed as a Majapahit monarch or prime minister.\n# ''Saur Sepuh'' (1987\u20131991), a radio drama and film by Niki Kosasih. Begun as a popular radio drama program in the late 1980s, Saur Sepuh is based on 15th-century Java, centred around the story about a fictional hero named Brama Kumbara, the king of Madangkara, a fictional kingdom neighbour of the [[Kingdom of Sunda|Pajajaran]]. In several stories the Paregreg war is described, that is to say the civil war of Majapahit between Wikramawardhana and Bhre Wirabhumi. This part has been made into a single feature film entitled 'Saur Sepuh' as well.\n# ''Tutur Tinular'', a radio drama and film by S Tidjab. Tutur Tinular is a [[martial art]] historical epic fictional story with the Majapahit era serving as the background of the story. The story also involved a romance between the hero named Arya Kamandanu and his Chinese lover Mei Shin.\n# ''Wali Songo'', the film tells the story of nine [[Muslim]] saints ('wali') who spread [[Islam]] to Java. The story took place near the end of the Majapahit era and the formation of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]]. It describes the decaying Majapahit empire where royals are fighting each other for power while the commoners suffer.\n# ''Senopati Pamungkas'' (1986, reprinted in 2003), a martial art-historical epic novel by Arswendo Atmowiloto. It takes place in the late Singhasari period and formation of Majapahit. This novel describes the sagas, royal intrigues, and romance of the formation of the kingdom as well as the adventure of the main character, a commoner named Upasara Wulung and his forbidden love affair with princess Gayatri Rajapatni, whom later becomes the consort of [[Raden Wijaya]], the first king of Majapahit.\n#  ''Imperium Majapahit'', a comic book series by Jan Mintaraga, published by Elexmedia Komputindo. This series tells the history of Majapahit from its formation until the decline.\n# ''[[Puteri Gunung Ledang (film)|Puteri Gunung Ledang]]'' (2004), a [[Malaysia]]n epic film based on [[Legend of Puteri Gunung Ledang|a traditional Malay legend]]. This film recounts the love story between Gusti Putri Retno Dumilah, a Majapahit princess, and [[Hang Tuah]], a [[Malaccan Sultanate|Malaccan]] admiral.\n# ''[[Gajah Mada (book)|Gajah Mada]]'', a [[pentalogy]] written by [[Langit Kresna Hariadi]] depicting a fictionalised detail of [[Gajah Mada]]'s life from the [[Gajah Mada#Rise to Mahapatih|Kuti rebellion]] up to the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]].\n# ''[[Dyah Pitaloka]]'' (2007), a novel written by Hermawan Aksan, fictionalising the detailed life story of Sundanese princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]] set around the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]]. The novel virtually takes the same context and was inspired by the [[Kidung Sundayana]].\n# ''Jung Jawa'' (2009), an anthology of short stories written by Rendra Fatrisna Kurniawan, imagining the life of the Nusantara people, published by Babel Publishing.\n# ''[[Civilization 5: Brave New World]] (2013)'', where [[Gajah Mada]] appeared as one of the leaders of a great civilisation in the second expansion of the [[Civilization 5]] game. He is the leader of the Indonesian civilisation, with the emblem of the Indonesian empire being the [[Surya Majapahit]], although in the game the empire is known as the \"Indonesian empire\" instead.\n# Later, in [[Civilization VI|''Civilization 6 (2016),'']] ''a'' downloadable content has one of its rulers, [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Dyah Gitarja]] (referred as Gitarja in-game) as the leader of the Indonesian civilization, with the emblem being a simpler version of the Surya Majapahit. The unique unit of Indonesian civilization is the ''jong''.\n# On the ''Rise of the Rajas'' expansion pack from ''[[Age of Empires II]]'', [[Gajah Mada]] appears in a campaign detailing his rise and then fall after the Pasunda Bubat tragedy.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gosari inscription]]\n* [[Kidung Sunda]]\n* [[List of monarchs of Java]]\n* [[Osing people|Osing]]\n* [[Srivijaya]]\n* [[Tenggerese people|Tenggerese]]\n* [[Hinduism in Indonesia]]\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist | group=lower-roman | close}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=miksic>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9813018267\n| series    = Indonesian Heritage Series\n| title     = Ancient History\n| publisher = Archipelago Press / Editions Didier Millet\n| year      = 1999\n| editor    = John Miksic\n| volume    = Vol 1\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=ricklefs>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9780804721950\n| last      = Ricklefs\n| first     = Merle Calvin\n| title     = A history of modern Indonesia since c. 1300\n| year      = 1993\n| publisher = Stanford University Press / Macmillans\n| edition   = 2nd\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=yingyai>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9780521010320\n| author    = Ma Huan\n| title     = [[Yingya Shenglan|Ying-yai Sheng-lan]] (\u701b\u6daf\u80dc\u89c8) The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores\n| others    = translated by J.V.G Mills\n| language  = Chinese\n| origyear  = 1433\n| year      = 1970\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| series    = [[Hakluyt Society]]\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Majapahit}}\n{{div col}}\n* [http://www.eastjava.com/books/trowulan/history/history.html A Short History of Majapahit]\n* [http://www.eastjava.com/books/majapahit/ Memoirs of Majapahit Kingdom]\n* [http://users.skynet.be/network.indonesia/ni4001c6.htm A brief history of Majapahit]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120125090000/http://sejarahnasional.org/index.php/kerajaan-nusantara/1-terjemahan-manuskrip-nagarakertagama A Complete Transcription of Majapahit Royal Manuscript of Nagarakertagama from SejarahNasional.org an National History Website]\n{{col div end}}\n\n{{Precolonial states in Indonesia}}\n{{Asia in topic|Hinduism in}}\n{{Empires}}\n{{Coord missing|Indonesia}}\n\n[[Category:1527 disestablishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1293]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1527]]\n[[Category:Historical Hindu empires]]\n[[Category:Precolonial states of Indonesia]]\n[[Category:1293 establishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Malaysian history]]\n[[Category:Majapahit]]\n[[Category:Former empires in Asia]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Indonesian history]]\n[[Category:Hindu Buddhist states in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Island countries]]\n[[Category:Indianized kingdoms]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Empire based on the island of Java from 1293 to around 1500}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox country\n|conventional_long_name = Majapahit Empire\n|common_name            = Majapahit Empire\n|native_name            = \ua9a4\ua992\ua9ab\ua9b6\ua98f\ua9ab\ua997\ua9a4\ua9c0\ua9a9\ua997\ua9a5\ua9bb\ua9a0\ua9c0 {{small|([[Bahasa Jawa|Jawa]])}}<br>\u1b27\u1b44\u1b2d\u1b1a\u1b2b\u1b1a\u1b27\u1b33\u1b36\u1b22\u1b44 {{small|([[Basa Bali|Bali]])}}<br>''\u1b8a\u1b9b\u1b8f\u1b83\u1b94\u1baa\u1b99\u1b8f\u1b95\u1ba0\u1ba4\u1b92\u1baa'' {{small|([[Bahasa Sunda|Sunda]])}}\n|religion               = [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Kebatinan|Kejawen]], [[Animism]]\n|p1                     = Singhasari\n|s1                     = Demak Sultanate\n|s2                     = Bali Kingdom\n|year_start             = 1293\n|year_end               = 1527\n|date_start             = 10 November<ref name=\"NGI Trowulan\">{{cite web|title = 10 November, Hari Berdirinya Majapahit | author = Mahandis Y.

The reign of Jayanegara was a difficult and chaotic one, troubled with several rebellions by his father's former companions in arms. Among others are Gajah Biru's rebellion in 1314 and the Kuti rebellion in 1319. The Kuti rebellion was the most dangerous one, as Kuti managed to take control of the capital city.

One of his distasteful acts was his desire to take his own half sisters, Gitarja and Rajadewi, as wives. Since Javanese tradition abhorred the practice of half siblings marrying, the council of royal elders spoke strongly against the king's wishes. It was not clear what motivated Jayanegara's wish \u2013 it might have been his way to ensure his claim to the throne by preventing rivals from being his half sisters' suitors, although in the later period of the Majapahit court the custom of marriage among cousins was quite common. In the ''[[Pararaton]]'', he was known as ''Kala Gemet'', or \"weak villain\". About the time of Jayanegara's reign, the Italian Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] visited the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nIn 1328, Jayanegara was murdered by his physician, Tanca, during a surgical operation. In complete mayhem and rage, Gajah Mada immediately killed Tanca. The motive behind this [[regicide]] was never clear. According to the ''Pararaton'', it was Tanca's revenge for the king sexually abusing his wife.

After seven months of battles, Majapahit forces defeated the Balinese king and captured the Balinese capital of Bedulu in 1343. After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses. Through this campaign, Majapahit planted a vassal dynasty that would rule the [[Bali Kingdom]] in the following centuries. Tribhuwana ruled Majapahit until the death of her mother in 1350.

These Chinese voyages visited numbers of ports in Asia as far as [[Africa]], including Majapahit ports. It was said that Zheng He has paid a visit to the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nThese massive Chinese voyages were not merely a naval exploration, but also a show of power and a display of geopolitical reach. The Chinese Ming dynasty had recently overthrown the Mongols Yuan dynasty, and were eager to establish their hegemony in the world, which changed the geopolitical balance in Asia.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\">{{cite news | title = History of Indian Ocean shows how old rivalries can trigger rise of new forces | work = Times of India | date = 6 August 2016 | author = Sanjeev Sanyal | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/History-of-Indian-Ocean-shows-how-old-rivalries-can-trigger-rise-of-new-forces/articleshow/53577849.cms}}</ref> Chinese intervened in the politics of the southern seas by supporting Thais against the declining Khmer Empire, support and installing allied factions in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and other places in [[Indian Ocean]] coasts. However, perhaps the most significant Chinese intervention was its support for the newly established [[Sultanate of Malacca]], as a rival and counter-weight to the Majapahit influence of Java.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" /> \n\nPreviously, Majapahit has succeeded to assert its influence in Malacca strait by containing the aspiration of Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula to ever reach the geopolitical might like those of Srivijaya. The Hindu Majapahit were the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming's support for Malacca, and the spread of Islam propagated by both Malacca and Zheng He's treasure fleet has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in Sumatra, which caused the northern part of the island to increasingly converting to Islam and gained independence from Majapahit, leaving [[Indragiri]], [[Jambi]] and [[Palembang]], remnants of the old [[Srivijaya]], the only suzerainty under Majapahit in Sumatra,{{efn | group=lower-roman | According to the History of Ming, only these areas in Sumatra were still mentioned as under Javanese / Majapahit supremacy at the time. Read <ref name=\"notes on the malay archipelago\" />}} bordering [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] on the west and independent Muslim kingdoms on the north.\n\nThis Ming dynasty voyages is extremely important for Majapahit historiography, since Zheng He's translator [[Ma Huan]] wrote ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'', a detailed description of Majapahit,<ref name=\"yingyai\" /> which provides a valuable insight on the culture, customs, also various social and economic aspects of Java during Majapahit period.<ref name=\"Chao-Wa\" />\n\nThe Chinese provided systematic support to Malacca, and its sultan made at least one trip to personally pay obeisance to the Ming emperor. Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to [[Islam]] in the region, while Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in coastal northern Java, thus created a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as [[Semarang]], [[Demak, Indonesia|Demak]], [[Tuban]], and [[Surabaya|Ampel]]; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java. Malacca prospered under Chinese Ming protection, while the Majapahit were steadily pushed back.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" />\n\n====Queen Suhita====\n[[File:Suhita.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The mortuary deified portrait statue of Queen [[Suhita]] (reign 1429-1447), discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java, [[National Museum of Indonesia]].]]\nWikramawardhana ruled until 1426 and was succeeded by his daughter [[Suhita]],<ref name=\"Coedes\" />{{rp|242}} who ruled from 1426 to 1447. She was the second child of Wikramawardhana by a concubine who was the daughter of Wirabhumi. The reign of Suhita was the second time Majapahit was reigned by a queen regnant after her great grandmother Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi. Her reign is immortalized in Javanese legend of [[Damarwulan]], as it involves a maiden queen named Prabu Kenya in the story, and during Suhita's reign there was a war with [[Blambangan]] as stated in the legend.<ref>Claire Holt. ''Art in Indonesia: Continuities and Change''.

After Kertawijaya died, [[Bhre Pamotan]] became a king with formal name Rajasawardhana. He died in 1453. A three-year kingless period was possibly the result of a succession crisis. [[Girisawardhana]], son of Kertawijaya, came to power in 1456. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by Singhawikramawardhana.\n\n====The divide====\nIn 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against Singhawikramawardhana, promoting himself as the king of Majapahit. Deposed Singhawikramawardhana retreated upstream of Brantas River, moved the kingdom's capital further inland to [[Kediri (city)|Daha]] (the former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]]), effectively splitting Majapahit, under Bhre Kertabumi in Trowulan and Singhawikramawardhana in Daha. Singhawikramawardhana continued his rule until he was succeeded by his son [[Girindrawardhana]] (Ranawijaya) in 1474.\n\nAnd in between this period of the dividing court of Majapahit, the kingdom found itself unable to control its western part of the already crumbling empire. The rising power of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] began to gain effective control of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] in the mid-15th century and expanding its influence to Sumatra. And amidst these events, Indragiri and Siantan, according to [[Malay Annals]] were given to Malacca as a dowry for the marriage of a Majapahit princess and the [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|sultan of Malacca]].<ref name=\"Leyden\">Leyden, John (1821)[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=J9JAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Malay Annals (translated from the Malay language)], Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown.</ref>, further weakening Majapahit's influence on the western part of the archipelago. Kertabhumi managed to stabilized this situation by allying with Muslim merchants, giving them trading rights on the north coast of Java, with [[Demak Regency|Demak]] as its centre and in return asked for their loyalty to Majapahit. This policy boosted the Majapahit treasury and power, but weakened Hindu-Buddhism as its main religion because [[Dawah|Islamic proselytizing]] spread faster, especially in Javanese coastal principalities. Hindu-Buddhist followers' grievances later paved the way for Ranawijaya to defeat Kertabumi.\n\n[[Image:Muzium Negara KL38.JPG|thumb|right|The model of a Majapahit ship display in [[Muzium Negara]], [[Kuala Lumpur]].

This event led to the war between the [[Sultanate of Demak]] and [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Daha]], since Demak rulers were descendants of Kertabhumi.\n\nDuring this period of Majapahit's retreat to the inland [[Kediri|Daha]] and war in Java, [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]], being the dominant ruler of the Javanese coastal lands and Java as a whole, seized the region of Jambi and Palembang in Sumatra from Majapahit.<ref name=\":3\" />{{rp|154\u2013155}}\n\n====Demak invasion and the fall of Majapahit====\n[[File:Masjid Agung Demak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] was the earliest Islamic polity in Java that replaced Majapahit.]]\nIn 1498, there was a turning point when Girindrawardhana was deposed by his vice regent, Udara. After this coup, the war between Demak and Daha receded, with some sources saying [[Raden Patah]], Sultan of Demak, left Majapahit alone as his father had done before, while others said Udara agreed to become a vassal of Demak, even marrying Raden Patah's youngest daughter.\n\nMeanwhile in the west, [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Malacca was captured by Portuguese in 1511]].

The refugees fled to the east to avoid Demak retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi. \n\nDemak came under the leadership of Raden (later crowned as Sultan) Patah (Arabic name: Fatah, lit. \"liberator\", \"conqueror\"), who was acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Majapahit. According to Babad Tanah Jawi and Demak tradition, the source of Patah's legitimacy was because their first sultan, Raden Patah, was the son of Majapahit king Brawijaya V with a Chinese concubine. Another argument supports Demak as the successor of Majapahit; the rising Demak sultanate was easily accepted as the nominal regional ruler, as Demak was the former Majapahit vassal and located near the former Majapahit realm in Eastern Java.\n\nDemak established itself as the regional power and the first Islamic sultanate in Java. After the fall of Majapahit, the Hindu kingdoms in Java only remained in [[Blambangan]] on the eastern edge and [[Sunda Kingdom|Pajajaran]] in the western part. Gradually [[Hindu]] communities began to retreat to the mountain ranges in East Java and also to the neighbouring island of [[Bali]]. A small enclave of [[Tenggerese people|Hindu communities]] still remain in the [[Tengger caldera|Tengger]] mountain range.\n\n== Military ==\nAccording to History of Yuan, soldiers of early Majapahit era were mainly dominated by poorly equipped light [[infantry]]. During the Mongol invasion of Java, Javanese army was described as temporarily mobilized farmers and a few noble warriors. The nobility marched at the front line, with huge rear army composed of peasants. The Javanese peasant army was half-naked and covered with cotton fabric at the waist ([[sarung]]). Most of the weapons are bows and arrows, [[bamboo]] spears, and short blades.

Unlike the earlier naturalistic, relaxed and flowing figures of classical Central Java style ([[Sailendra]] art c. 8th to 10th century), this East Javanese style demonstrates a stiffer pose, stylised and rendered in [[wayang]]-like figures, such as those carved on East Javanese temple's bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs were projected rather flat from the background. This style was later preserved in [[Balinese art]], especially in its [[Kamasan]] style classical paintings and Balinese wayang.\n\nThe statues of Hindu gods and Buddhist deities in Majapahit art were also the continuisation of its previous Singhasari art. The statues of East Javanese period tends to be stiffer and frontal-formal pose, compared to the statues of Central Javanese art (c. 9th century) that are more Indianized style, relaxed in [[tribhanga]] pose. The stiffer pose of Majapahit gods statues are probably in accordance to the statue's function as the deified portrayal self of the dead Majapahit monarch. The carving however, are richly decorated, especially with fine floral carving of lotus plants carved on the stela behind the statue. Examples of Majapahit statues are the Harihara statue from Simping temple, believed to be the deified portrayal of [[Raden Wijaya|King Kertarajasa]], the statue of Parwati believed to be the portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Queen Tribhuwana]], and statue of queen [[Suhita]] discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java.\n\n[[File:Pair of door guardians SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Pair of door guardians from a temple, Eastern Java, 14th century, [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Museum of Asian Art, San Francisco]].]]\n\nClay pottery and brick masonry are popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture. The [[Majapahit Terracotta]] art also flourished in this period. Significant numbers of [[terracotta]] artefacts were discovered in [[Trowulan]]. The artefacts ranges from human and animal figurines, jars, vessels, water containers, [[piggy bank]]s, bas reliefs, architectural ornaments, roof pinnacles, floor tiles, to pipes and roof tiles. One of the most interesting findings is Majapahit piggy bank. Several boar-shaped piggy banks has been discovered in Trowulan. It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word ''celengan'' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] means both \"savings\" and \"piggy bank\". It was derived from the word ''celeng'' which means \"wild boar\", the [[suffix]] \"-an\" was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large piggy bank has been found broken to pieces.\n\nTerracotta money boxes also has been found in different shapes, such as tubular or boxes, with slits to slip coins. Another important terracotta artefact is the head figurine of a man popularly thought to be the depiction of Gajah Mada, although it is not certain about who was depicted in these figurines.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jabung]] temple near Paiton, Probolinggo, East Java, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n\nIn his book ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan also describes the Majapahit cities: most of them do not have walls surrounding the city or the suburbs. He describes the king's palace in Majapahit. The king's residence is surrounded with thick red brick walls more than three ''[[zhang (unit)|chang]]'' high (about {{convert|30.5|ft|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}), with length of more than 200 paces ({{convert|340|yd|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and on the wall there are two layers of gates, the palace is very well guarded and clean. The king's palace was a two-storey building, each of them 3 or 4 ''chang'' high ({{convert|9\u201314.5|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}). It had wooden plank floors and exposed mats made from rattan or reeds (presumably palm leaves), where people sat cross-legged. The roof was made of hardwood shingles (Javanese:''sirap'') laid as tiles.<ref name=yingyai />\n\nThe houses of commoners had thatched roofs ([[nipa palm]] leaves). Every family has a storage shed made of bricks, about 3 or 4 ''[[Chi (unit)|Ch'ih]]'' ({{convert|48.9|in|cm|abbr=off|disp=or}}) above the ground, where they kept the family property, and they lived on top of this building, to sit and sleep.\n\nThe Majapahit temple architecture follows the east Javanese styles, in contrast of earlier central Javanese style. This east Javanese temple style is also dated back from Kediri period c. 11th century. The shapes of Majapahit temples are tends to be slender and tall, with roof constructed from multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure curved upward smoothly creating the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective illussion]] that the temple is perceived taller than its actual height. The pinnacle of the temples are usually cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples). Although some of temples dated from Majapahit period used [[andesite]] or [[sandstone]], the red [[brick]]s is also a popular construction material.\n\n[[File:Bajang Ratu Gate Trowulan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The 16.5-metre tall Bajang Ratu [[Paduraksa]] gate, at Trowulan, echoed the grandeur of Majapahit.]]\n\nAlthough [[brick]] had been used in the ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was Majapahit architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|author=Schoppert, P., Damais, S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in Trowulan, [[Pari Temple|Pari]] in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo, and [[Candi Surawana|Surawana temple]] near Kediri. Jabung temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Bajrajinaparamitapura, despite some parts of its roof and pinnacles are now missing, it is one of the most well-preserved Majapahit temple architecture. Another example include Gunung Gangsir temple near Pasuruan. Some of the temples are dated from earlier period but renovated and expanded during Majapahit era, such as [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], the largest temple in East Java dated back to [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] era. This temple was identified in Nagarakretagama as Palah temple and reported being visited by King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. Another notable temple of Eastern Javanese style is [[Jawi temple]] in Pandaan \u2013 also visited by King Hayam Wuruk, the temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Jajawa, and was dedicated as mortuary temple for his great grandfather, King Kertanegara of Singhasari.\n\nSome of typical architectural style are believed to be developed during Majapahit era; such as tall and slender roofed red brick gate commonly called as ''kori agung'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'', and also split gate of ''[[candi bentar]]''. The large split gate of Wringin Lawang located at Jatipasar, Trowulan, Mojokerto, East Java, is one of the oldest and the largest surviving ''candi bentar'' dated from Majapahit era. The ''candi bentar'' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure \u2013 consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof \u2013 evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the centre for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound through tall roof ''paduraksa'' gate with enclosed door. The example of ''kori agung'' or ''paduraksa'' style gate is the elegant Bajang Ratu gate richly decorated with Kala demon, cyclops and also the bas-relief telling the story of Sri Tanjung. Those typical Majapahit architectural style has deeply influenced the Javanese and [[Balinese architecture]] of later period. The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates, was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\">{{cite book | title = Majapahit Style Vol.1 | author = Made Wijaya | publisher = Wijaya Words - a division of Yayasan Beringin Berapi| year = 2014 | isbn = 9786027136700| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Majapahit_Style_Vol_1.html?id=J3GMBAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>\n\nIn later period near the fall of Majapahit, the art and architecture of Majapahit witnessed the revival of indigenous native Austronesian [[megalithic architectural elements]], such as [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples on western slopes of [[Mount Lawu]].

(Collection of [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]])]]\nTaxes and fines were paid in cash. Javanese economy had been partly monetised since the late 8th century, using gold and silver coins. Previously, the 9th-century [[Wonoboyo hoard]] discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40&nbsp;kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in [[Sidoarjo]] in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era.<ref>{{cite web | title = Uang Kuno Temuan Rohimin Peninggalan Majapahit | url = http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | date = November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131031003554/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | archivedate = 31 October 2013}}</ref> The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume it was due to the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a [[currency]] system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited.<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} These ''kepeng'' Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes\u2014the imported Chinese copper coins\u2014enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped ''celengan'' (piggy bank).\n\nSome idea of scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java).<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silver smiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non-agrarian pursuits seems to have become even greater during the Majapahit era.\n\nThe great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice [[Tillage|cultivation]], and during Majapahit's prime numerous [[irrigation]] projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided an important source of income for Majapahit.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nThe Nagarakretagama states that the fame of the ruler of Wilwatikta (a synonym for Majapahit) attracted foreign merchants from far and wide, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese among others. While in later period, ''Yingya Shenglan'' mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from west (from Arab and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and Malay peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh ([[Surabaya]]). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], [[Vietnam|Annam]] and [[Champa]] in today Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]], Burmese [[Martaban]] and the south Indian [[Vijayanagara Empire]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{multiple image|align=right| direction = vertical|total_width=150|image1=Surya Majapahit.jpg|image2=Surya Majapahit 2.jpg|image3=Candi Ceto Majapahit Sun, Surakarta 1264.jpg|footer=Three designs of [[Surya Majapahit]], the sun emblem of the kingdom.}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]], Majapahit employed a well-organised bureaucratic structure for administrative purposes.

The king holds the highest political authority and legitimacy.\n\n===Bureaucracy officials===\nDuring his daily administration, the king is assisted by bureaucratic state officials that also included the close relatives of the kings that hold certain esteemed titles. The royal order or edict usually transmitted from the king to the high officials well to their subordinates. The officials in Majapahit courts are:\n:* ''Rakryan Mahamantri Katrini'', usually reserved for the king's heir\n:* ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'', the board of [[Minister (government)|ministers]] that conduct the daily administration\n:* ''Dharmmadhyaksa'', the officials of laws, state laws as well as religious laws\n:* ''Dharmma-upapatti'', the officials concerning religious affairs\n\nWithin the ministers of ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'' there is the most important and the highest minister titled ''Rakryan Mapatih'' or ''Patih Hamangkubhumi''. This position is analogous to [[prime minister]], and together with king, they determine the important state policies, including war or peace. Among the Dharmmadhyaksa officials there is ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasewan'' (State's highest Hindu [[Shivaist]] priest) and ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasogatan'' (State's highest Buddhist priest), both are the religious laws authorities of each dharmic faiths.\n\nThere is also the board of advisors which consists of the elders within royal family called ''Bhattara Saptaprabhu''. This council consists of seven influential elders\u2014mostly directly related to the king. They are the ''Bhres'' (Duke or Duchess) acted as regional kings, the rulers of Majapahit provinces. This council congregates, offers advice, gave consideration to the king, and often formed an assembly to judge a certain important case in the court. Example of their office was, their sentence to temporarily suspend Mahamantri Gajah Mada, as a punishment since he was held responsible for the shamefully disastrous [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat incident]]. The council also sentenced the execution of Raden Gajah (Narapati) for decapitating Bhre Wirabhumi in [[Paregreg war]].<ref name=\"BP-Sejarah Nasional\">{{cite book | title = Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Zaman kuno \u2013 Volume 2 dari Sejarah nasional Indonesia | author1= Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro | author2= Soejono (R.

The traditional or initial area of Majapahit during its formation before entering the imperial phase. This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of capital, all the way to [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] port (Surabaya) are considered as parts of ''Negara Agung''.\n* '''''Mancanegara''''', areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' \u2014 traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture, and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their own rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of [[Java]] island, [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. However, in later period, overseas provinces which has developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered as ''mancanegara''. Either the province has their own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].\n* '''''Nusantara''''', areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in [[Malay peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n[[File:Filippine, provincia di agusan, immagine hindu, statuetta in oro massiccio, xiii secolo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A 1.79 kilogram, 21-karat Majapahit period [[Golden Tara|gold image]] discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan|Agusan]], [[Philippines]], copied Nganjuk bronze images of the early Majapahit period,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/view/item/7096|title=[Bronze statues from Nganjuk] OD-3577 {{!}} Digital Collections|website=digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> signify Majapahit cultural influence on southern Philippines.]]\n\n[[Nagarakretagama#Descriptions of the Majapahit realm|Nagarakretagama]] mentioned more than 80 places in the archipelago described as the vassal states.<ref name=\"Britannica-Majapahit\"/> In Canto 13, several lands on [[Sumatra]] are mentioned, and some possibly correspond to contemporary areas: [[Jambi]], [[Palembang]], Teba ([[Toba Samosir Regency|Toba]]), and [[Dharmasraya]].

Since early of its formation, Majapahit inherited the foreign outlook of its predecessor \u2013 [[Singhasari]], in which its last king [[Kertanegara]] projected his influence abroad by launching [[Pamalayu]] expedition to incorporate Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula within Javanese sphere of influence. Previously, Singhasari seeks to dominate trade route, especially Malacca strait, and also saw the outreach of Mongolian-Chinese Yuan influence into Southeast Asia as the threat of their own realm.\n\nDuring its formation, the returning Pamalayu expedition has brought Malayu Kingdoms in Jambi and Dharmasraya under Javanese suzerainty. Therefore, Java often seen itself as the overlord of most of polities in the Indonesian archipelago. In Sumatran front, Majapahit did capture Palembang, Jambi and Dharmasraya, invade Pasai, and it also saw the settlement of [[Tumasik]], that later become [[Kingdom of Singapura]], as its rebellious colony, and thus deal with them accordingly.\n\nDuring the reign of Majapahit's first two monarch \u2013 Wijaya and Jayanegara, the kingdom struggled to consolidate its rule, plagued by number of rebellions. However, it was not until the reign of its third monarch \u2013 Queen Tribhuwana, and her son, Hayam Wuruk \u2013 that the kingdom began to projected its power overseas. Majapahit's confidence for dominance was stemmed for their economic and demographic comparative advantage; agrarian as well as maritime nation; their immense rice production and human resources, also their mastery in shipbuilding and military technology, compared to its neighbours. These strenght was used by Gajah Mada to expand the kingdom's influence. This rather imperialistic outlooks, has projected in the way he forcefully dealt with Majapahit's neighbours; the Pabali (conquest of Bali) and the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]]. Majapahit pulled Bali into their orbit as a vassal state. While the disasterous diplomacy with Sunda kingdom has led to the enmity among them. \n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Pura Maospahit Denpasar Bali.jpg|thumb|right|''Pura Maospahit'' (\"Majapahit Temple\") in [[Denpasar]], Bali, demonstrate the typical Majapahit red brick architecture.]]\n\nMajapahit was the largest empire ever to form in Southeast Asia.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}} Although its political power beyond the core area in east Java was diffuse, constituting mainly ceremonial recognition of suzerainty, Majapahit society developed a high degree of sophistication in both commercial and artistic activities.

The [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycles]], the tale of [[Sri Tanjung]], and the epic of [[Damarwulan]], are popular tales in Javanese and [[Balinese literature]]s. The tales of Panji was dated from older period during Kediri kingdom, while the tale of Sri Tanjung and the epic of Damarwulan took place during Majapahit period. These tales remained a popular theme in Javanese culture of later period during Mataram Sultanate, and often became the source of inspiration for [[wayang]] shadow puppet performance, [[ketoprak]] and [[topeng]] dance drama. The Panji tales in particular have spread from East Java to become a source of inspiration for literature and dance drama throughout the region, as far as Malay peninsula, Cambodia and Siam where he is known as Raden Inao or Enau ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32}}) of Kurepan.{{Sfn|Holt|1967|p=274}}\n\nMajapahit had a momentous and lasting influence on [[Indonesian art]] and [[Indonesian architecture|architecture]]. The empire's expansion circa 14th-century, contributed to the difussion Javanese cultural influence throughout the archipelago, which can be seen as a form of [[Javanisation]]. It was probably during this period that some of Javanese cultural elements, such as [[gamelan]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-gamelan-195131|title=Learn the History Behind Gamelan, Indonesian Music and Dance|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref> and kris, being expanded and introduced to islands outside of Java.

The Majapahit style ''[[candi bentar]]'' split gate, the ''kori'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'' towering red brick gate, and also ''pendopo'' pavilion have become ubiquitous in Javanese and Balinese architectural features, as seen in [[Menara Kudus Mosque]], [[Keraton Kasepuhan]] and Sunyaragi park in [[Cirebon]], [[Mataram Sultanate]] royal cemetery in [[Kota Gede]], [[Yogyakarta]], and various palaces and temples in Bali.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\"/>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebfs op het Pendopo Terras Panataran tempelcomplex TMnr 20027152.jpg|thumb|right|Bas relief from [[Candi Penataran]] describes the Javanese-style [[pendopo]] pavilion, commonly found across Java and Bali.]]\n\nThe vivid, rich and festive [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]] is considered as one of Majapahit legacy.

The aesthetics and style of bas-reliefs in Majapahit East Javanese temples were preserved and copied in Balinese temples. It is also due to the fact that after the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests had taken refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java or across the narrow strait to Bali. Indeed, in some ways the [[Bali Kingdom|Kingdom of Bali]] was the successor of Majapahit. Large numbers of Majapahit manuscripts, such as [[Nagarakretagama]], [[Kakawin Sutasoma|Sutasoma]], [[Pararaton]] and [[Tantu Pagelaran]], were being well-kept in royal libraries of Bali and Lombok, and provides the glimpse and valuable historical records on Majapahit. The Majapahit Hindu-Javanese culture has shaped the culture of Bali, that led to popular expression; \"without Java there is no Bali\". Yet in return, Bali is credited as the last stronghold to safeguard and preserve the ancient Hindu Javanese civilisation.\n\n[[File:WLANL - mchangsp - Kris van Knaud.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to Majapahit period]]\n\nIn weaponry, the Majapahit expansion is believed to be responsible for the widespread use of the [[Kris|keris]] dagger in Southeast Asia; from Java, Bali, Sumatra, Malaysia, Brunei to Southern Thailand.

Although it took place in the Majapahit era, the comic strip serves as witty [[satire]] and [[criticism]] of modern Indonesian society. From a political, social, cultural and current point of view, Indonesia is described as the '[[reincarnation]]' of the Majapahit empire. The current Indonesian president is often portrayed as a Majapahit monarch or prime minister.\n# ''Saur Sepuh'' (1987\u20131991), a radio drama and film by Niki Kosasih.

The story took place near the end of the Majapahit era and the formation of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]]. It describes the decaying Majapahit empire where royals are fighting each other for power while the commoners suffer.\n# ''Senopati Pamungkas'' (1986, reprinted in 2003), a martial art-historical epic novel by Arswendo Atmowiloto. It takes place in the late Singhasari period and formation of Majapahit.

Other scholars, such as Hilmar Kaiser, [[Donald Bloxham]] and [[Taner Ak\u00e7am]] have differing opinions with regards to the extent of governmental involvement and systematic nature in the killings, asserting a less systematic policy and different treatment in comparison to the Armenians.\n\nUnlike the Armenians, there were no orders to deport Assyrians. The attacks against them were not of a standardized nature and incorporated various methods; in some cities, all Assyrian men were slain and the women were forced to flee. These massacres were often carried out upon the initiatives of local politicians and Kurdish tribes. Exposure, disease and starvation during the flight of Assyrians increased the death toll, and women were subjected to widespread [[sexual abuse]] in some areas.\n\nEstimates on the overall death toll have varied. Providing detailed statistics of the various estimates of the Churches' population after the genocide, David Gaunt accepts the figure of 275,000 deaths as reported by the Assyrian delegation at the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] and ventures that the death toll would be around 300,000 because of uncounted Assyrian-inhabited areas.<ref name=\"The Assyrian Genocide of 1915\">David Gaunt, [http://www.seyfocenter.com/index.php?sid=2&aID=36 \"The Assyrian Genocide of 1915\"], ''Assyrian Genocide Research Center'', 2009</ref> [[Rudolph Rummel]] gives the number of Christian deaths in Assyrian-populated regions of Turkey as 102,000 and adds to this the killing of around 47,000 Assyrians in Persia.\n\nIn 2007, the [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]] (IAGS) reached a consensus that the \"Ottoman campaign against Christian minorities of the Empire between 1914 and 1923 constituted a genocide against Armenians, Assyrians, and [[Pontian Greeks|Pontian]] and [[Ottoman Greeks|Anatolian Greeks]].\"<ref>[http://www.genocidescholars.org/images/PRelease16Dec07IAGS_Officially_Recognizes_Assyrian_Greek_Genocides.pdf Genocide Scholars Association Officially Recognizes Assyrian Greek Genocides. 16 December 2007.

Nestorians, Syrians, Syriacs, and Chaldeans were names used by Western missionaries such as the Catholics and Protestants on the Ottoman and Persian Assyrians. The Greek, Persian, and Arab rulers of occupied Assyria, as well as Chaldean and Syriac Orthodox patriarchs, priests, and monks, and Armenian, British, and French laypeople, called them all Assyrians.<ref name=\"Travis2\"/>\n\nThe Assyrian genocide is sometimes also referred to as ''Sayfo'' or ''Seyfo'' in English-language sources, based on the modern Assyrian (Mesopotamian neo-Aramaic) designation ''Sayp\u0101'' ({{lang|arc|\u0723\u071d\u0726\u0710}}), \"[[saif|sword]]\", pronounced as ''Seyfo'' or ''Sayfo'' in the [[Turoyo language|Western dialect]] (the term abbreviates {{lang-syr|\u072b\u0722\u072c\u0710 \u0715\u0723\u071d\u0726\u0710|\u0160ato d-Sayfo}}, \"Year of the Sword\").

Like other Christians residing in the empire, they were treated as second-class citizens and denied public positions of power. Violence directed against them prior to the First World War was not new. Many Assyrians were subjected to [[Kurds|Kurdish]] brigandage and even outright massacre and forced conversion to Islam, as was the case of the Assyrians of Hakkari during the [[massacres of Badr Khan]] in the 1840s and the [[Massacres of Diyarbak\u0131r (1895)|Massacres of Diyarbak\u0131r]] during the 1895\u201396 [[Hamidian Massacres]].<ref name=\"Anahit\"/> The [[Hamidiye (cavalry)|Hamidiye]] received assurances from the Ottoman Sultan that they could kill Assyrians and Armenians with impunity, and were particularly active in [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa|Urhoy]] and [[Amid|Diyarbakir]].<ref name=\"Travis2\"/>\n\n===Outbreak of war===\nThe Ottoman Empire began massacring Assyrians in the nineteenth century, a time of friendly relations between the Ottomans and the British, who were defending the Ottomans from the Russian Empire's efforts to include under its protection the communities of Ottoman Orthodox Christians.<ref name=\"Travis2\"/> In October 1914, the Ottoman Empire began deporting and massacring Assyrians and Armenians in [[Van, Turkey|Van]].<ref name=\"Travis2\"/> After attacking Russian cities and declaring war on Britain and France, the Empire declared a holy war on Christians.<ref name=\"Travis2\"/> The German Kaiser and the German Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire directed and orchestrated the holy war, and financed the Ottomans' war against the Russian Empire.<ref name=\"Travis2\"/>\n\n===Responsibility of the Ottoman government===\nThe degree of the responsibility of the Ottoman government and whether the genocide had a systematic nature has been the subject of different scholarly opinions. Concerning the responsibility of the Ottoman government, Hilmar Kaiser wrote that Talaat Pasha ordered the deportations of the Assyrians in the area on 26 October 1914, fearing their collaboration with the advancing Russian troops, but the order was postponed and abandoned three days later due to a lack of forces. When the Assyrians did not collaborate with Russians, any plans to deport them were cancelled. Kaiser wrote that the massacres of Assyrians were apparently not a part of the official Ottoman policy and that the Assyrians were ordered to be treated differently from the Armenians.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kaiser|first1=Hilmar|editor1-last=Bloxham|editor1-first=Donald|editor2-last=Moses|editor2-first=A.

The killing in rural regions was more extensive, while some survived the massacres in cities; Gaunt states that this indicates that a primary aim was the confiscation of land. The property, villages and animals of the villagers were destroyed totally to prevent their return.

He cites accounts of killings at town halls, river rafts, tunnels, streets, and during the flight of the victims.

During the [[Assyrian Genocide]], tens of thousands of refugees from throughout Tur Abdin arrived here for safety. At one point, the number of Assyrians in the village was up to 21980 people. Refugees arrived from villages including Habasnos, [[Midyat]], Bote, [[Keferze]], [[Elbegendi|Kafro Eloyto]], [[Mzizah]] and Urnas. Even refugees from outside Tur Abdin arrived, coming from villages such as Deqlath, Bscheriye, Gozarto, [[Hasankeyf|Hesno d Kifo]] and Mifarqin.\n\nBeing aware of the Turks and Kurds were coming to G\u00fclg\u00f6ze, the Assyrian villagers and refugees created a militia to defend themselves, which was led by Masud Mirza, the son of a Melik.

However, [[Aziz Agha]], the leader of the [[Midyat]] area, told them that they didn't have enough soldiers to attack both areas, and therefore they would attack Gulgoze only, and then go to Arnas later on. Therefore, The Kurds of Tur Abdin and Ramman, under the generalship of Ahmed Agha and Salem Agha, collected themselves in [[Mardin]], and created a unit of 13,000 men. The government authorized the distribution of arms, and they headed towards G\u00fclg\u00f6ze, arriving late at night to begin the siege.\n\nAfter hours of gun-battle, the Assyrians drove the Kurds away, though both sides experienced many casualties. After 10 days, The Kurds attacked again only to be beaten yet again, as they lost well over 300 men. Before the beginning of a third attempt, Kurdish leaders called for aid from the mayors of [[Diyarbak\u0131r]](Raschid) and [[Mardin]](Badri). However, A third attempt also failed and after 30 days of battle, Aziz Agha suggested a peace treaty between the two sides. 3 Assyrians met with Aziz to discuss a peace treaty, But the Assyrians refused to lay down their weapons, thus the battle continued. The siege continued for another 30 days leading to many deaths on both sides. In the end, the Kurdish soldiers surrendered and left the Assyrians of Tur Abdin alone, hence why the Tur Abdin region is the only Christian populated area left in Turkey outside of [[Istanbul]]. The total death toll of this 60-day siege is unknown, but there were at least 1,000 deaths with both sides losses combined.\n\n===Assyrian resistance in upper Mesopotamia===\nOn March 3, 1918, the Ottoman army led by Kurdish soldiers assassinated one of the most important Assyrian leaders at the time. This resulted in the retaliation of the Assyrians. [[Malik Khoshaba]] of the [[Tyari]] tribe, alongside Assyrian military leader [[Agha Petros]] led a successful attack against the Ottomans. Assyrian forces in the region also attacked the Kurdish fortress of [[Simko Shikak]], the leader who had assassinated [[Mar Shimun XIX Benyamin]], they successfully stormed it, defeating the Kurds, however Simko escaped and fled.\n\nAssyrians were involved in a number of clashes in Turkey with Ottoman forces, including [[Kurds]] and [[Circassians]] loyal to the empire. When armed and in sufficient numbers they were able to defend themselves successfully. However, they were often cut off in small pockets, vastly outnumbered and surrounded, and unarmed villagers made easy targets for Ottoman and Kurdish forces.\n\n==Events in Persia==\n{{see also|Persian campaign}}\n===Assyrian resistance in Persia===\nThe Assyrians in Persia armed themselves under the command of General [[Agha Petros]], who had been approached by the Allies to help fight the Ottomans.{{when|date=February 2015}} They put up a resistance, and Agha Petros' volunteer army had quite a few successes over the Ottoman forces and their [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] allies, notably at Suldouze where 1,500 Assyrian horsemen overcame the far larger Ottoman force of over 8,000, commanded by Kheiri Bey. Agha Petros also defeated the [[Ottoman Turks]] in a major engagement at Sauj Bulak and drove them back to Rowanduz.

The mission had enough money to convince the Ottomans to let 20 of the men go. However, on February 22 the remaining 41 were executed, having their heads cut off at the stairs of the Charbachsh Gate. The dead included bishop Mar Denkha.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n[[File:Ruins of Gulpashan.jpg|thumb|right|Old picture depicting the ruins of the Assyrian village of [[Golpashan]] ([[West Azerbaijan Province]], Iran) after its destruction by the invading Ottoman army.]]\nMost of the Assyrian villages were unarmed. The only protection they had was when the Russian army finally took control of the area, years after the presence of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] had been removed. On February 25, 1915, Ottoman troops stormed their way into the villages of Gulpashan and Salamas. Almost the entire village of [[Golpashan]], of a population of 2,500, were massacred.<ref name=\"Anahit\"/> In [[Salmas]], about 750 Armenian and Assyrian refugees were protected by Iranian civilians in the village. The commander of the Ottoman division stormed the houses despite the fact that Iranian Azerbaijanis lived in them, and roped all the men together in large groups and forced them to march in the fields between Khusrawa and Haftevan/Hafdewan. The men were shot or killed in other ways. The protection of Christians by local civilians (primarily [[Iranian Azerbaijanis]]) is also confirmed in the 1915 British report: \"Many Moslems tried to save their Christian neighbours and offered them shelter in their houses, but the Turkish authorities were implacable.\"<ref name=bryce/> According to American official accounts, the largest Assyrian village in the Urmia region was overrun and all its men killed, while the women were attacked.

American documents report widespread sexual violence against Assyrian women of all ages and the looting and destruction of the houses of about five-sixth of the Assyrian population. Reports state that over 200 girls were forced into sexual slavery and conversion into Islam. Eugene Griselle from the Ethnological Society of Paris gives the figure of 8,500 for the number of deaths in the Urmia region; according to other reports, out of an Assyrian population of 30,000, one-fifth was killed, their villages and churches destroyed. An English priest in the area estimates the death toll at 6,000.<ref name=Travis/>\n\nHowever, David Gaunt wrote that the massacres were reciprocated by the Assyrians. Assyrian Jilu tribes were accused of committing massacres of local villagers in the plains of Salmas; local Iranian officials reported that between [[Khoy|Khoi]] and [[Jolfa, Iran (city)|Julfa]], a great number of villagers were massacred.<ref>Gaunt, ''Massacres, Resistance, Protectors: Muslim-Christian Relations in Eastern Anatolia during World War I'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=4mug9LrpLKcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Massacres,+resistance,+protectors&hl=en&ei=ECZLTcCpFML48AahyaTJDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Urmia&f=false p. 104].</ref>\n\nIn 1918, the Assyrian population of Urmia was nearly wiped out, 1,000 killed in the French and American mission buildings, 200 surrounding villages destroyed, and thousands perished from disease, forced marches and the [[Persian famine of 1917\u20131919]].<ref name=\"Travis2\"/>\n\nIn early 1918, many Assyrians started to flee present-day Turkey. Mar Shimun Benyamin had arranged for some 3,500 Assyrians to reside in the district of [[Khoy|Khoi]]. Not long after settling in, Kurdish troops of the Ottoman Army massacred the population almost entirely. One of the few that survived was Reverend John Eshoo. After escaping, he stated:\n\n{{quotation|You have undoubtedly heard of the Assyrian massacre of Khoi, but I am certain you do not know the details.<br /><br />These Assyrians were assembled into one [[caravansary]], and shot to death by guns and revolvers. Blood literally flowed in little streams, and the entire open space within the caravansary became a pool of crimson liquid. The place was too small to hold all the living victims waiting for execution. They were brought in groups, and each new group was compelled to stand over the heap of the still bleeding bodies and shot to death. The fearful place became literally a human slaughter house, receiving its speechless victims, in groups of ten and twenty at a time, for execution.<br /><br />At the same time, the Assyrians, who were residing in the suburb of the city, were brought together and driven into the spacious courtyard of a house [...] The Assyrian refugees were kept under guard for eight days, without anything to eat. At last they were removed from their place of confinement and taken to a spot prepared for their brutal killing. These helpless Assyrians marched like lambs to their slaughter, and they opened not their mouth, save by sayings \"Lord, into thy hands we commit our spirits. [...]<br /><br />The executioners began by cutting first the fingers of their victims, join by joint, till the two hands were entirely amputated. Then they were stretched on the ground, after the manner of the animals that are slain in the Fast, but these with their faces turned upward, and their heads resting upon the stones or blocks of wood Then their throats were half cut, so as to prolong their torture of dying, and while struggling in the agony of death, the victims were kicked and clubbed by heavy poles the murderers carried Many of them, while still laboring under the pain of death, were thrown into ditches and buried before their souls had expired.<br /><br />The young men and the able-bodied men were separated from among the very young and the old. They were taken some distance from the city and used as targets by the shooters. They all fell, a few not mortally wounded. One of the leaders went to the heaps of the fallen and shouted aloud, swearing by the names of Islam's prophets that those who had not received mortal wounds should rise and depart, as they would not be harmed any more. A few, thus deceived, stood up, but only to fall this time killed by another volley from the guns of the murderers.<br /><br />Some of the younger and good looking women, together with a few little girls of attractive appearance, pleaded to be killed. Against their will were forced into Islam's harems. Others were subjected to such fiendish insults that I cannot possibly describe. Death, however, came to their rescue and saved them from the vile passions of the demons. The death toll of Assyrians totaled 2,770 men, women and children.<ref name=Werda>Joel Euel Werda.

Close to 800 were confirmed dead in Urmia, and another 2,000 had perished from disease.

Other scholars, such as Hilmar Kaiser, [[Donald Bloxham]] and [[Taner Ak\u00e7am]] have differing opinions with regards to the extent of governmental involvement and systematic nature in the killings, asserting a less systematic policy and different treatment in comparison to the Armenians.\n\nUnlike the Armenians, there were no orders to deport Assyrians. The attacks against them were not of a standardized nature and incorporated various methods; in some cities, all Assyrian men were slain and the women were forced to flee. These massacres were often carried out upon the initiatives of local politicians and Kurdish tribes. Exposure, disease and starvation during the flight of Assyrians increased the death toll, and women were subjected to widespread [[sexual abuse]] in some areas.\n\nEstimates on the overall death toll have varied. Providing detailed statistics of the various estimates of the Churches' population after the genocide, David Gaunt accepts the figure of 275,000 deaths as reported by the Assyrian delegation at the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] and ventures that the death toll would be around 300,000 because of uncounted Assyrian-inhabited areas.<ref name=\"The Assyrian Genocide of 1915\">David Gaunt, [http://www.seyfocenter.com/index.php?sid=2&aID=36 \"The Assyrian Genocide of 1915\"], ''Assyrian Genocide Research Center'', 2009</ref> [[Rudolph Rummel]] gives the number of Christian deaths in Assyrian-populated regions of Turkey as 102,000 and adds to this the killing of around 47,000 Assyrians in Persia.\n\nIn 2007, the [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]] (IAGS) reached a consensus that the \"Ottoman campaign against Christian minorities of the Empire between 1914 and 1923 constituted a genocide against Armenians, Assyrians, and [[Pontian Greeks|Pontian]] and [[Ottoman Greeks|Anatolian Greeks]].\"<ref>[http://www.genocidescholars.org/images/PRelease16Dec07IAGS_Officially_Recognizes_Assyrian_Greek_Genocides.pdf Genocide Scholars Association Officially Recognizes Assyrian Greek Genocides. 16 December 2007.

Nestorians, Syrians, Syriacs, and Chaldeans were names used by Western missionaries such as the Catholics and Protestants on the Ottoman and Persian Assyrians. The Greek, Persian, and Arab rulers of occupied Assyria, as well as Chaldean and Syriac Orthodox patriarchs, priests, and monks, and Armenian, British, and French laypeople, called them all Assyrians.<ref name=\"Travis2\"/>\n\nThe Assyrian genocide is sometimes also referred to as ''Sayfo'' or ''Seyfo'' in English-language sources, based on the modern Assyrian (Mesopotamian neo-Aramaic) designation ''Sayp\u0101'' ({{lang|arc|\u0723\u071d\u0726\u0710}}), \"[[saif|sword]]\", pronounced as ''Seyfo'' or ''Sayfo'' in the [[Turoyo language|Western dialect]] (the term abbreviates {{lang-syr|\u072b\u0722\u072c\u0710 \u0715\u0723\u071d\u0726\u0710|\u0160ato d-Sayfo}}, \"Year of the Sword\").

The word ''q\u1e6dolamo'' ({{lang|tru|\u0729\u071b\u0720\u0725\u0721\u0710}}) which means \"genocide\" is also used in Assyrian diaspora media.

Like other Christians residing in the empire, they were treated as second-class citizens and denied public positions of power. Violence directed against them prior to the First World War was not new. Many Assyrians were subjected to [[Kurds|Kurdish]] brigandage and even outright massacre and forced conversion to Islam, as was the case of the Assyrians of Hakkari during the [[massacres of Badr Khan]] in the 1840s and the [[Massacres of Diyarbak\u0131r (1895)|Massacres of Diyarbak\u0131r]] during the 1895\u201396 [[Hamidian Massacres]].<ref name=\"Anahit\"/> The [[Hamidiye (cavalry)|Hamidiye]] received assurances from the Ottoman Sultan that they could kill Assyrians and Armenians with impunity, and were particularly active in [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa|Urhoy]] and [[Amid|Diyarbakir]].<ref name=\"Travis2\"/>\n\n===Outbreak of war===\nThe Ottoman Empire began massacring Assyrians in the nineteenth century, a time of friendly relations between the Ottomans and the British, who were defending the Ottomans from the Russian Empire's efforts to include under its protection the communities of Ottoman Orthodox Christians.<ref name=\"Travis2\"/> In October 1914, the Ottoman Empire began deporting and massacring Assyrians and Armenians in [[Van, Turkey|Van]].<ref name=\"Travis2\"/> After attacking Russian cities and declaring war on Britain and France, the Empire declared a holy war on Christians.<ref name=\"Travis2\"/> The German Kaiser and the German Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire directed and orchestrated the holy war, and financed the Ottomans' war against the Russian Empire.<ref name=\"Travis2\"/>\n\n===Responsibility of the Ottoman government===\nThe degree of the responsibility of the Ottoman government and whether the genocide had a systematic nature has been the subject of different scholarly opinions. Concerning the responsibility of the Ottoman government, Hilmar Kaiser wrote that Talaat Pasha ordered the deportations of the Assyrians in the area on 26 October 1914, fearing their collaboration with the advancing Russian troops, but the order was postponed and abandoned three days later due to a lack of forces. When the Assyrians did not collaborate with Russians, any plans to deport them were cancelled. Kaiser wrote that the massacres of Assyrians were apparently not a part of the official Ottoman policy and that the Assyrians were ordered to be treated differently from the Armenians.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kaiser|first1=Hilmar|editor1-last=Bloxham|editor1-first=Donald|editor2-last=Moses|editor2-first=A.

However, [[Aziz Agha]], the leader of the [[Midyat]] area, told them that they didn't have enough soldiers to attack both areas, and therefore they would attack Gulgoze only, and then go to Arnas later on. Therefore, The Kurds of Tur Abdin and Ramman, under the generalship of Ahmed Agha and Salem Agha, collected themselves in [[Mardin]], and created a unit of 13,000 men. The government authorized the distribution of arms, and they headed towards G\u00fclg\u00f6ze, arriving late at night to begin the siege.\n\nAfter hours of gun-battle, the Assyrians drove the Kurds away, though both sides experienced many casualties. After 10 days, The Kurds attacked again only to be beaten yet again, as they lost well over 300 men. Before the beginning of a third attempt, Kurdish leaders called for aid from the mayors of [[Diyarbak\u0131r]](Raschid) and [[Mardin]](Badri). However, A third attempt also failed and after 30 days of battle, Aziz Agha suggested a peace treaty between the two sides. 3 Assyrians met with Aziz to discuss a peace treaty, But the Assyrians refused to lay down their weapons, thus the battle continued. The siege continued for another 30 days leading to many deaths on both sides. In the end, the Kurdish soldiers surrendered and left the Assyrians of Tur Abdin alone, hence why the Tur Abdin region is the only Christian populated area left in Turkey outside of [[Istanbul]]. The total death toll of this 60-day siege is unknown, but there were at least 1,000 deaths with both sides losses combined.\n\n===Assyrian resistance in upper Mesopotamia===\nOn March 3, 1918, the Ottoman army led by Kurdish soldiers assassinated one of the most important Assyrian leaders at the time. This resulted in the retaliation of the Assyrians. [[Malik Khoshaba]] of the [[Tyari]] tribe, alongside Assyrian military leader [[Agha Petros]] led a successful attack against the Ottomans. Assyrian forces in the region also attacked the Kurdish fortress of [[Simko Shikak]], the leader who had assassinated [[Mar Shimun XIX Benyamin]], they successfully stormed it, defeating the Kurds, however Simko escaped and fled.\n\nAssyrians were involved in a number of clashes in Turkey with Ottoman forces, including [[Kurds]] and [[Circassians]] loyal to the empire. When armed and in sufficient numbers they were able to defend themselves successfully. However, they were often cut off in small pockets, vastly outnumbered and surrounded, and unarmed villagers made easy targets for Ottoman and Kurdish forces.\n\n==Events in Persia==\n{{see also|Persian campaign}}\nThe Assyrians in Persia armed themselves under the command of General [[Agha Petros]], who had been approached by the Allies to help fight the Ottomans.{{when|date=February 2015}} They put up a resistance, and Agha Petros' volunteer army had quite a few successes over the Ottoman forces and their [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] allies, notably at Suldouze where 1,500 Assyrian horsemen overcame the far larger Ottoman force of over 8,000, commanded by Kheiri Bey. Agha Petros also defeated the [[Ottoman Turks]] in a major engagement at Sauj Bulak and drove them back to Rowanduz.

The men were shot or killed in other ways.

American documents report widespread sexual violence against Assyrian women of all ages and the looting and destruction of the houses of about five-sixth of the Assyrian population. Reports state that over 200 girls were forced into sexual slavery and conversion into Islam. Eugene Griselle from the Ethnological Society of Paris gives the figure of 8,500 for the number of deaths in the Urmia region; according to other reports, out of an Assyrian population of 30,000, one-fifth was killed, their villages and churches destroyed.

Mar Shimun Benyamin had arranged for some 3,500 Assyrians to reside in the district of [[Khoy|Khoi]]. Not long after settling in, Kurdish troops of the Ottoman Army massacred the population almost entirely. One of the few that survived was Reverend John Eshoo. After escaping, he stated:\n\n{{quotation|You have undoubtedly heard of the Assyrian massacre of Khoi, but I am certain you do not know the details.<br /><br />These Assyrians were assembled into one [[caravansary]], and shot to death by guns and revolvers.

They were brought in groups, and each new group was compelled to stand over the heap of the still bleeding bodies and shot to death. The fearful place became literally a human slaughter house, receiving its speechless victims, in groups of ten and twenty at a time, for execution.<br /><br />At the same time, the Assyrians, who were residing in the suburb of the city, were brought together and driven into the spacious courtyard of a house [...] The Assyrian refugees were kept under guard for eight days, without anything to eat.

Then they were stretched on the ground, after the manner of the animals that are slain in the Fast, but these with their faces turned upward, and their heads resting upon the stones or blocks of wood Then their throats were half cut, so as to prolong their torture of dying, and while struggling in the agony of death, the victims were kicked and clubbed by heavy poles the murderers carried Many of them, while still laboring under the pain of death, were thrown into ditches and buried before their souls had expired.<br /><br />The young men and the able-bodied men were separated from among the very young and the old. They were taken some distance from the city and used as targets by the shooters. They all fell, a few not mortally wounded. One of the leaders went to the heaps of the fallen and shouted aloud, swearing by the names of Islam's prophets that those who had not received mortal wounds should rise and depart, as they would not be harmed any more. A few, thus deceived, stood up, but only to fall this time killed by another volley from the guns of the murderers.<br /><br />Some of the younger and good looking women, together with a few little girls of attractive appearance, pleaded to be killed. Against their will were forced into Islam's harems. Others were subjected to such fiendish insults that I cannot possibly describe. Death, however, came to their rescue and saved them from the vile passions of the demons. The death toll of Assyrians totaled 2,770 men, women and children.<ref name=Werda>Joel Euel Werda.

At Baquba, Assyrians were forced to defend themselves from further Arab and Kurdish raids, which they were able to do successfully.\n\nA memorandum from American Presbyterian Missionaries at Urmia During the Great War 16 to British Minister Sir Percy Cox had this to say:\n\n<blockquote>Capt. Gracey doubtless talked rather big in the hopes of putting heart into the Assyrians and holding up this front against the Turks. [Consequently,] We have met all the orders issued by the late [[William Ambrose Shedd|Dr. Shedd]] which have been presented to us and a very large number of Assyrian refugees are being maintained at Baquba, chiefly at H.M.G.'s expense.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1920, the British decided to close down the Baquba camps. The majority of Assyrians of the camp decided to go back to the Hakkari mountains, while the rest were dispersed throughout Iraq, where there was already an Assyrian community.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, they would again be targeted there in the 1933 [[Simele massacre]].\n\n==Death toll==\nScholars have summarized events as follows: specific massacres included 25,000 Assyrians in Midyat, 21,000 in Jezira-ibn-Omar, 7,000 in Nisibis, 7,000 in Urfa, 7,000 in the Qudshanis region, 6,000 in Mardin, 5,000 in Diyarbekir, 4,000 in Adana, 4,000 in Brahimie, and 3,500 in Harput.<ref name=\"Anahit\"/><ref name=\"Travis\">Travis, Hannibal. \"[https://archive.is/20120716033637/http://utpjournals.metapress.com/content/yv544142p5rnx055/?p=91e7dbe895ec4cbf9eef0ad842fef76a&pi=6 'Native Christians Massacred': The Ottoman Genocide of the Assyrians During World War I].\" ''Genocide Studies and Prevention'', Vol. 1, No. 3, December 2006, pp. 327\u2013371.

Nolan's first few days on the job are marked by a domestic dispute that quickly escalates out of hand (during which Nolan witnesses his first death), an unbalanced father who leaves his child in a locked car on a hot day, and an escaped felon who quickly tests Nolan in ways he never expected. Also joining Nolan as rookie officers are Jackson West, son of a high-ranking LAPD officer and eager to live up to the family legacy, and Lucy Chen, who became a cop against the wishes of her therapist parents and is carrying on a secret affair with Nolan despite the risk it poses to her career. Grey informs Nolan that he will do everything in his power to discourage him from continuing to serve, as he fears that Nolan's inexperience and age will endanger the lives of his officers. Nolan tells Grey that he believes being a cop might be his calling. Grey responds that if that is true, nothing Grey puts Nolan through will deter him.\n| LineColor       = 7D9DB8\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Crash Course\n| DirectedBy      = [[Adam Davidson (director)|Adam Davidson]]\n| WrittenBy       = Alexi Hawley\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|23}}\n| ProdCode        = 102\n| Viewers         = 4.54<ref name=\"1.02\">{{cite web |url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tuesday-final-ratings-oct-23-2018/ |title=World Series and ''New Amsterdam'' adjust up: Tuesday final ratings |last=Welch |first=Alex |work=TV by the Numbers |date=October 24, 2018 |accessdate=October 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025001939/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tuesday-final-ratings-oct-23-2018/ |archive-date=October 25, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Nolan persuades a woman not to commit suicide.

Caleb orders Chen to get in a barrel at gunpoint, which he proceeds to bury in the middle of the desert. As the station works to find her, Caleb proceeds to kidnap Armstrong and take him to a house that belonged to Rosalind's uncle.

His assignment to the force is met with skepticism from his fellow officers, particularly his watch commander, Sergeant Wade Grey, and his training officer Talia Bishop. Nolan's first few days on the job are marked by a domestic dispute that quickly escalates out of hand (during which Nolan witnesses his first death), an unbalanced father who leaves his child in a locked car on a hot day, and an escaped felon who quickly tests Nolan in ways he never expected. Also joining Nolan as rookie officers are Jackson West, son of a high-ranking LAPD officer and eager to live up to the family legacy, and Lucy Chen, who became a cop against the wishes of her therapist parents and is carrying on a secret affair with Nolan despite the risk it poses to her career. Grey informs Nolan that he will do everything in his power to discourage him from continuing to serve, as he fears that Nolan's inexperience and age will endanger the lives of his officers. Nolan tells Grey that he believes being a cop might be his calling. Grey responds that if that is true, nothing Grey puts Nolan through will deter him.\n| LineColor       = 7D9DB8\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Crash Course\n| DirectedBy      = [[Adam Davidson (director)|Adam Davidson]]\n| WrittenBy       = Alexi Hawley\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|23}}\n| ProdCode        = 102\n| Viewers         = 4.54<ref name=\"1.02\">{{cite web |url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tuesday-final-ratings-oct-23-2018/ |title=World Series and ''New Amsterdam'' adjust up: Tuesday final ratings |last=Welch |first=Alex |work=TV by the Numbers |date=October 24, 2018 |accessdate=October 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025001939/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tuesday-final-ratings-oct-23-2018/ |archive-date=October 25, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Nolan persuades a woman not to commit suicide.
