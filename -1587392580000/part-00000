It was the first stage in the evolution of the [[steppe]] and [[tundra]] [[elephant]]s and the ancestor of the [[woolly mammoth]] and [[Columbian mammoth]] of the later Pleistocene. Populations of steppe mammoth may have persisted in northern China and Mongolia as recently as 33,000 years ago.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Elephantidae - Mammuthus trogontherii.JPG|thumb|left|Molar of ''Mammuthus trogontherii'' at the [[National Museum (Prague)]]]]\nThere is confusion about the correct scientific name for the steppe mammoth, either ''Mammuthus armeniacus'' (Falconer 1857) or ''Mammuthus trogontherii'' (Pohlig 1885). Falconer used material from Asian sources while Pohlig worked with fossil remains from Europe and both names appear in scientific publications, adding to the confusion. A first taxonomical overhaul was done by Maglio 1973<ref>Maglio VJ. 1973. Origin and evolution of the elephantidae. Trans Am Philos Soc 633:1\u2013149.</ref> who decided that both names were synonyms, ''armeniacus'' being the older, hence the preferred name. However, in Shoshoni & Tassy 1996<ref>Shoshoni, J., & Tassy, P., (eds.), 1996: The Proboscidea - Evolution and paleontology of elephants and their relatives. United Kingdom: Oxford University Press.</ref> it was decided that the description of Pohlig prevailed, and consequently the correct name for the steppe mammoth is ''M. trogontherii''. It is unclear whether both forms are indeed identical and authors tend to use the name ''M. trogontherii'' for European material and ''M. armeniacus'' for Asian remains.\n\nSeveral Japanese mammoth varieties from the early Pleistocene have been named, but all are now thought to be synonyms of ''M. trogontherii''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=van de Greer, Alexandra|author2=Lyras, George|author3=de Vos, John|author4=Dermitzakis, Michael|title=Evolution of Island Mammals: Adaptation and Extinction of Placental Mammals on Islands|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1444391282|page=240|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JmSsNuwMAxgC&dq=Mammuthus+paramammonteus|language=Danish, English}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Mammuthus trogontherii122DB.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration]] \nThe steppe mammoth had a short skull compared to ''[[Mammuthus meridionalis|M. meridionalis]]'' as well as a smaller jaw.

In [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], she was the first [[List of female United States presidential and vice-presidential candidates|female vice-presidential nominee]] representing an American major political party.\n\nFerraro grew up in New York City and worked as a public school teacher before training as a lawyer. She joined the [[Queens|Queens County]] [[District Attorney|District Attorney's Office]] in 1974, heading the new Special Victims Bureau that dealt with sex crimes, child abuse, and domestic violence.  In 1978 she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where she rose rapidly in the party hierarchy while focusing on legislation to bring equity for women in the areas of wages, pensions, and retirement plans.\n\nIn 1984, former vice president and presidential candidate [[Walter Mondale]], seen as an underdog, selected Ferraro to be his running mate in the upcoming election. Ferraro became the only [[Italian American]] to be a major-party national nominee in addition to being the first woman. The positive polling the Mondale-Ferraro ticket received when she joined soon faded, as damaging questions arose about her and her businessman husband's finances and wealth and her Congressional disclosure statements. In the general election, Mondale and Ferraro were defeated in a [[Landslide victory|landslide]] by incumbent [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]].\n\nFerraro ran campaigns for a seat in the [[United States Senate]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] in [[1992 United States Senate election in New York|1992]] and [[1998 United States Senate election in New York|1998]], both times starting as the front-runner for her party's nomination before losing in the primary election. She served as the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Council|Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] from 1993 until 1996 during the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|presidential administration]] of [[Bill Clinton]]. She also continued her career as a journalist, author, and businesswoman, and served in the [[Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign|2008 presidential campaign]] of Senator [[Hillary Clinton]].

In [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], she was the first [[List of female United States presidential and vice-presidential candidates|female vice-presidential nominee]] representing a American major political party.\n\nFerraro grew up in New York City and worked as a public school teacher before training as a lawyer. She joined the [[Queens|Queens County]] [[District Attorney|District Attorney's Office]] in 1974, heading the new Special Victims Bureau that dealt with sex crimes, child abuse, and domestic violence.  In 1978 she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where she rose rapidly in the party hierarchy while focusing on legislation to bring equity for women in the areas of wages, pensions, and retirement plans.\n\nIn 1984, former vice president and presidential candidate [[Walter Mondale]], seen as an underdog, selected Ferraro to be his running mate in the upcoming election. Ferraro became the only [[Italian American]] to be a major-party national nominee in addition to being the first woman. The positive polling the Mondale-Ferraro ticket received when she joined soon faded, as damaging questions arose about her and her businessman husband's finances and wealth and her Congressional disclosure statements. In the general election, Mondale and Ferraro were defeated in a [[Landslide victory|landslide]] by incumbent [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]].\n\nFerraro ran campaigns for a seat in the [[United States Senate]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] in [[1992 United States Senate election in New York|1992]] and [[1998 United States Senate election in New York|1998]], both times starting as the front-runner for her party's nomination before losing in the primary election. She served as the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Council|Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] from 1993 until 1996 during the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|presidential administration]] of [[Bill Clinton]]. She also continued her career as a journalist, author, and businesswoman, and served in the [[Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign|2008 presidential campaign]] of Senator [[Hillary Clinton]]. Ferraro died on March 26, 2011 from [[multiple myeloma]], 12 years after being diagnosed.\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Ferraro childhood home.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Narrow, red three-story house with turret|Ferraro lived in this building in Newburgh until she was ten.]]\nGeraldine Ferraro was born on August 26, 1935, in [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh, New York]],<ref name=\"nyt-woman\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/10/us/woman-in-the-news-democrat-peacemaker-geraldine-anne-ferraro.html | title=Woman in the News; Democrat, Peacemaker: Geraldine Anne Ferraro | author=Perlez, Jane | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date=April 10, 1984}}</ref> the daughter of Antonetta L.

There is some confusion, as there are a few other plants, including other members of the genus ''Viburnum'', also referred to as \"snowball bush\".\n\nThe shrub is also cultivated as a component of hedgerows, cover plantings, and as part of other naturalistic plantings in its native regions.\n\nIt is [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] in North America, where it is called \"European cranberrybush\" (although it is not a [[cranberry]]).\n\nThe cultivars 'Notcutt\u2019s Variety',<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Viburnum opulus'' 'Notcutt's Variety' \n| url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/45677/i-Viburnum-opulus-i-Notcutt-s-Variety/Details |accessdate=17 February 2019}}</ref> 'Roseum'<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Viburnum opulus'' 'Roseum'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=2008|accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref> and 'Xanthocarpum'<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Viburnum opulus'' 'Xanthocarpum'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=4288|accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref> have gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/pdfs/agm-lists/agm-ornamentals.pdf | title = AGM Plants - Ornamental | date = July 2017 | page = 107 | publisher = Royal Horticultural Society | accessdate = 17 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Other uses==\nThe fruit is edible in small quantities, with a very acidic taste; it can be used to make jelly.

The leaves are opposite, three-lobed, {{convert|5|-|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} long and broad, with a rounded base and coarsely serrated margins; they are superficially similar to the leaves of some [[maple]]s, most easily distinguished by their somewhat wrinkled surface with impressed leaf venation. The leaf [[bud]]s are green, with valvate bud scales.\n\nThe [[plant sexuality|hermaphrodite]] [[flower]]s are white, produced in [[corymb]]s {{convert|4|-|11|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter at the top of the stems; each corymb comprises a ring of outer sterile flowers 1.5\u20132&nbsp;cm in diameter with conspicuous petals, surrounding a center of small (5&nbsp;mm), fertile flowers; the flowers are produced in early summer, and [[pollination|pollinated]] by insects. The [[fruit]] is a globose bright red [[drupe]] 7\u201310&nbsp;mm diameter, containing a single [[seed]]. The seeds are dispersed by birds.\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:Snowball flowers (13985050634).jpg|thumb|'Roseum', syn. 'Snowball']]\n[[File:Viburnum-Siberia.jpg|thumb|''Viburnum opulus'' berries in [[Novosibirsk]], Siberian Russia]]\n''Viburnum opulus'' is grown as an [[ornamental plant]] for its flowers and berries, growing best on moist, moderately alkaline soils, though tolerating most soil types well. Several [[cultivar]]s have been selected, including 'Roseum' (synonym 'Sterile', 'Snowball'), in which all the flowers are only of the larger sterile type, with globular flower heads. There is some confusion, as there are a few other plants, including other members of the genus ''Viburnum'', also referred to as \"snowball bush\".\n\nThe shrub is also cultivated as a component of hedgerows, cover plantings, and as part of other naturalistic plantings in its native regions.\n\nIt is [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] in North America, where it is called \"European cranberrybush\" (although it is not a [[cranberry]]).\n\nThe cultivars 'Notcutt\u2019s Variety',<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Viburnum opulus'' 'Notcutt's Variety' \n| url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/45677/i-Viburnum-opulus-i-Notcutt-s-Variety/Details |accessdate=17 February 2019}}</ref> 'Roseum'<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Viburnum opulus'' 'Roseum'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=2008|accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref> and 'Xanthocarpum'<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Viburnum opulus'' 'Xanthocarpum'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=4288|accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref> have gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/pdfs/agm-lists/agm-ornamentals.pdf | title = AGM Plants - Ornamental | date = July 2017 | page = 107 | publisher = Royal Horticultural Society | accessdate = 17 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Other uses==\nThe fruit is edible in small quantities, with a very acidic taste; it can be used to make jelly.

However they would later trade that selection, their first round pick, and [[DeMarre Carroll]] to the [[Brooklyn Nets]] for the rights to [[Justin Hamilton (basketball, born 1990)|Justin Hamilton]].\n\nOn April 6th, 2018, the Raptors set new franchise records for total wins in a season with 57, home wins in a season with 33, and clinched the 1st seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time in franchise history. They would end the season with a record 59 wins and 34 home wins.  They would end up winning their 4th division title in 5 years.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Raptors faced the eighth seeded [[2017\u201318 Washington Wizards season|Washington Wizards]] in the first round, winning in six games. They advanced to the semifinals where they faced the [[2017-18 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]] once again, the team that had eliminated them in the past two NBA playoffs. Just like last season, the Raptors were swept in four games by the Cavaliers. They have now lost 10 straight playoff games to the Cavaliers. This sweep marked the 1st time the top seeded conference team was swept in a playoff series since 2015, where the [[2014-15 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta Hawks]] were also swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals. The Raptors also became the first top seeded conference team since [[2012-13 Oklahoma City Thunder season|2013]] to have not advanced to the Conference Finals, and the first in NBA history to get swept in the Semifinals.\n\nFollowing yet another disappointing playoff appearance, head coach [[Dwane Casey]] was fired on May 11th,\n2018. <ref>http://www.nba.com/article/2018/05/11/report-toronto-raptors-fire-coach-dwane-casey</ref>\n\n==Offseason==\n===Draft===\n{{main|2017 NBA draft}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n! style=\"{{NBA color cell|Toronto Raptors}}; width:10%;\"| Round\n! style=\"{{NBA color cell|Toronto Raptors}}; width:10%;\"| Pick\n! style=\"{{NBA color cell|Toronto Raptors}}; width:10%;\"| Player\n! style=\"{{NBA color cell|Toronto Raptors}}; width:10%;\"| Position\n! style=\"{{NBA color cell|Toronto Raptors}}; width:10%;\"| Nationality\n! style=\"{{NBA color cell|Toronto Raptors}}; width:10%;\"| College\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 1\n| 23\n| {{sortname|OG|Anunoby}}\n| SF\n| {{flagu|United Kingdom}}\n| [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]]\n|}\n\n==Roster==\n{{NBA roster header|team=Toronto Raptors|season=2017\u201318}}\n<!-- list of players -->\n{{player2 | num = 3 | first = OG | last = Anunoby | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 8 | lbs = 235 | college = Indiana | DOB = 1997\u201307\u201317 }}\n{{player2 | num = 4 | first = Lorenzo | last = Brown | pos = G | ft = 6 | in = 5 | lbs = 189 | college = North Carolina State | DOB = 1990\u201308\u201326 }}\n{{player2 | num = 10 | first = DeMar | last = DeRozan | pos = G | ft = 6 | in = 7 | lbs = 220 | college = Southern California | DOB = 1989\u201308\u201307 | note = C }}\n{{player2 | num = 9 | first = Serge | last = Ibaka | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 10 | lbs = 235 | from = Republic of the Congo | DOB = 1989\u201309\u201318 }}\n{{player2 | num = 7 | first = Kyle | last = Lowry | pos = G | ft = 6 | in = 1 | lbs = 195 | college = Villanova | DOB = 1986\u201303\u201325 | note = C }}\n{{player2 | num = 34 | first = Alfonzo | last = McKinnie | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 8 | lbs = 215 | college = Green Bay | DOB = 1992\u201309\u201317 }}\n{{player2 | num = 0 | first = C.

It is one of the city\u2019s two biggest annual festivals, the other being the ''Feria de Abril'' (April Fair), which follows two weeks later. It is celebrated in the week leading up to [[Easter]] ([[Holy Week]] among Christians), and features the [[procession]] of ''pasos'', floats of lifelike wooden [[sculptures]] of individual scenes of [[Rosary|sorrowfull Mysteries of the Rosary]], or images of the grieving [[Mary (Mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].\n\nSome of the sculptures are of great antiquity  and are considered artistic masterpieces, as well as being culturally and spiritually important to the local Catholic population.\n\n==Traditional Dress==\n\nThe traditional suit worn by women on Thursday (and sometimes on Good Friday) is known as ''La Mantilla'' (the mantle). This custom has become revitalised since the 1980s. The outfit consists of the lace mantle, stiffened by shell or another material, and a black dress, usually mid-leg, with black shoes. {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} It is expected for the woman to hold and show a rosary. Jewelry  may include, at most, bracelets and earrings. {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==The Days of Holy Week==\nBelow is a list of the brotherhoods which make penance each day, as of 2010, with the traditional year of establishment (or first procession to the Cathedral for those found in the last century), and a few notes. The names in the list are those in common usage.\n\nThey are ordered in the same sequence as they enter the Cathedral. Unlike other locations, this sequence is not related to the scenes of the Passion their images depict, but on a  historically grown set of rules of precedence, tradition, canonical needs, agreements between brotherhoods and logistical considerations.\n\nRain (or serious menace of) may affect the Processions, some may seek refuge to a nearby church or landmarks and wait for a perfect time to go back to their Church, or the Hermano Mayor may fully suspend the Procession.\nThere are 11 days of Holy Week as follows:\n\n===Friday of Pains===\n\n* ''Pino Montano''. \n\n* ''Pasi\u00f3n y Muerte'' (''Passion and Death''). 1991.\n* ''La Corona'' (''The Crown''). 1989\n* ''La Misi\u00f3n'' (''The Mission''). 1949.\n* ''Agrupaci\u00f3n Parroquial Bendici\u00f3n y Esperanza (Pol\u00edgono Sur)'' (''Parish Association Blessing and Hope''). 1992.\n\n===Saturday of Passion===\n\n* ''La Milagrosa (Ciudad Jard\u00edn)'' (''The Miraculous''). 1998.\n* ''Divino Perd\u00f3n (Parque Alcosa)'' (''Divine Forgiveness''). 1992.\n* ''Torreblanca'' (''WhiteTower''). 1961.\n* ''Padre P\u00edo'' (''Padre Pio''). 1986.\n* ''Agrupaci\u00f3n Parroquial Rosario (San Jer\u00f3nimo)'' (''Parish Association Rosary''). 2015.\n\n===Palm Sunday===\n* ''La Borriquita'' (''The Little She-Donkey'') depicting Christ\u2019s triumphal entry into Jerusalem.<ref name=Dykes/> The ''nazarenos'' corp is exclusively formed by children (except guardians and ''costaleros'').

It is one of the city\u2019s two biggest annual festivals, the other being the ''Feria de Abril'' (April Fair), which follows two weeks later. It is celebrated in the week leading up to [[Easter]] ([[Holy Week]] among Christians), and features the [[procession]] of ''pasos'', floats of lifelike wooden [[sculptures]] of individual scenes of [[Rosary|sorrowfull Mysteries of the Rosary]], or images of the grieving [[Mary (Mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].\n\nSome of the sculptures are of great antiquity  and are considered artistic masterpieces, as well as being culturally and spiritually important to the local Catholic population.\n\n==The Processions==\n\nThere are up to three ''pasos'' in each procession. The pasos dedicated to [[Jesus]] use figures of wood, wax, and wire to depict scenes from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], and are usually covered in gold. The pasos dedicated to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] are usually covered in silver, and depict Mary weeping for her Son and sometimes holding Him in her arms.<ref name=Dykes>[http://www.catholicdigest.com/articles/travel/no_sub_ministry/2010/02-15/holy-week-in-seville Dykes, Daniel. \"Holy Week in Seville\", ''Catholic Digest''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906164540/http://www.catholicdigest.com/articles/travel/no_sub_ministry/2010/02-15/holy-week-in-seville |date=2011-09-06 }}</ref>\n\nThe processions are organized by ''hermandades'' and ''cofrad\u00edas'', religious brotherhoods. Members precede the ''pasos'' dressed in penitential robes with ''[[capirote]]s'', tall, pointed hoods with eye-holes.<ref name=Hafiz>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/14/holy-week-seville_n_5148249.html Hafiz, Yasmine. \"Penitents Observe Holy Week In Seville, Spain With Processions And Robes\", Huffington Post, April 4, 2014]</ref> The ''capirotes'' were designed so the faithful could repent in anonymity, without being recognised as self-confessed sinners.<ref name=Watson>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/11144481/Semana-Santa-details-and-guide.html Watson, Fiona Flores. \"What is Semana Santa?\", ''The Telegraph'', October 8, 2014]</ref>\n\nNearly 70 ''cofradias'' (church brotherhoods) take part, each with their own image, as well as colourful misterios (tableaux of bible scenes), on elaborately-decorated pasos (floats). They may be accompanied by [[brass band]]s. The processions follow a designated route from their homes, churches and chapels to the [[Seville Cathedral|Cathedral]], usually via a central viewing area and back. The ones from the suburban ''barrios'' may take 14 hours to return to their home churches.<ref name=Watson/>\n\nThe processions continue from [[Palm Sunday]] to [[Easter Sunday]] morning. The climax of the week is the night of [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], when the processions set out to arrive at the Cathedral on the dawn of [[Good Friday]], known as the ''madrug\u00e1''.<ref name=Watson/>\n\n=== The Marching Order ===\n\nThe core events in ''Semana Santa'' are the processions of the brotherhoods, known as ''estaci\u00f3n de penitencia'' (stations of penance), from their home [[Church (building)|church]] or [[chapel]] to the [[Cathedral]] of [[Seville]] and back. The last section before arriving to the Cathedral is common to all brotherhoods and is called the ''Carrera Oficial''.\n\nThe standard structure of a procession is: \n* A great cross (the so-called ''Cruz de Gu\u00eda'' - Guiding Cross) is carried at the beginning of each procession.\n* A number of people (sometimes barefoot) dressed in a habit and with the distinctive pointed hood (''[[capirote]]''), and holding long wax candles (only lit by night), marching in silence. These are the ''nazarenos''. Colours, forms and details of the habit are distinctive for each brotherhood - and sometimes for different locations within the procession. Usually the ''Nazarenos'' march in pairs, and are grouped behind insignia. Moving between the lines are ''diputados de tramo'', guardians who keep the formations organized.\n* A group of altar boys, [[acolytes]], dressed in [[vestments]] (many of them wearing [[dalmatic]]s), with chandeliers and incense, and other servants.\n* The ''Paso''.\n* When applicable, the musical group follows (bands) or precedes the ''paso'' (chapel music)\n* A number of ''penitentes'', carrying wooden crosses, making public penance. They wear the habit and the hood of the brotherhood, but the hood is not pointed.\n\nThis structure repeats itself depending of the number of ''pasos'' (up to three). Usually the last ''paso'' is not followed by ''penitentes'', and the procession should be closed -presided- by the titular chaplain in full processional vestments known as ''el preste''<!-- TO.DO. ref to rituale romanum and El silencio article-->\n\nAlthough this is the standard structure, depending on the traditions of each brotherhood, details (and even the plan) may vary.\n\nA procession can be made up from a few hundred to near 3,000 ''Nazarenos''  and last anywhere from 4 to 14 hours, depending how far the home church is from the Cathedral. The largest processions can take over an hour and a half to cross one particular spot\n\n===The ''Paso''===\nAt the centre of each procession are the ''pasos'', an image or set of images set atop a moveable float of [[wood]]. \n\nThe first one would be a sculpted scene of the '''sorrowful [[Mysteries of the Rosary]]''':\n# The [[Agony in the Garden]]. Fruit of the Mystery: Sorrow for Sin, Uniformity with the Will of God\n# The [[Scourging at the Pillar]]. Fruit of the Mystery: Mortification, Purity\n# The [[Crowning with Thorns]]. Fruit of the Mystery: Contempt of the world, Courage\n# The [[Christ Carrying the Cross|Carrying of the Cross]]. Fruit of the Mystery: Patience\n# The [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion and Death of our Lord]]. Fruit of the Mystery: Perseverance, Salvation, Forgiveness\n\nThe structure of the ''paso'' is richly  carved and decorated  with fabric, flowers and candles. As of 2007, all but one of the ''dolorosas'' are covered by an ornate canopy or  [[baldachin]] (''palio'') attached to the structure.\n\nThe sculptures themselves are carved and painted, and often lifesize or larger. The oldest surviving were carved in the 16th century, {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} though new images continue to be added. Those highly regarded artistically include the  ''Jesus del Gran Poder'' and ''Cristo de la Buena Muerte'' by Juan de Mesa {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}, Francisco Antonio Ru\u00edz Gij\u00f3n's ''Cristo de la Expiraci\u00f3n'' (known as ''El Cachorro'') {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} and the two virgins named ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Esperanza'' from [[Macarena, Seville|Macarena]] and [[Triana, Seville|Triana]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} All of the principal images of the ''Semana Santa'' are on display for veneration in their home churches all year round.\n[[File:Semana santa-capataz sevilla.JPG|200px|thumb|Overseer giving orders to the ''costaleros''.]]\nA distinctive feature of Semana Santa in Seville is the style of marching of the ''pasos''.  A team of men, the ''costaleros'' (literally \"sack men\", for their distinctive - and functional - headdress), supporting the beams upon their shoulders and necks, lift, move and lower the ''paso''. As they are all inside the structure and hidden from the external view by a curtain, the ''paso'' seems to move by itself. On the outside an overseer (''capataz''), guides the team by voice, and/or through a ceremonial hammer ''el llamador'' (caller) attached to the ''paso''.\n\nDepending on weight (most weigh over a metric tonne), a ''paso'' requires between twenty-four and fifty-four ''costaleros'' to move. Each brotherhood has a distinctive way to raise and move a ''paso'', and even each ''paso'' within the procession.\n[[File:SemanaSantaSevillaLlamador.jpg|200px|thumb|Golden 'caller'.]]\n\n===The Music===\n[[File:SemanaSantaSevillaSaeta.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Singing a ''saeta''.]]\n\nSome processions are silent, with no musical accompaniment, some have [[a cappella]] choirs or wind [[quartets]], but many (and especially those historically associated with poorer neighbourhoods) feature a [[drum]] and [[trumpet]] band behind the image of Christ and a [[brass band]] behind the Virgin playing hymns or ''marchas'' from a standard repertoire <ref>Sevillian terminology for musical groupings is\n-''Banda de Cornetas y Tambores'' (drum and trumpet/cornet band).\n-''Banda de Musica'' (full [[brass band]] or [[Marching band]]) - It is only for the Virgin. The repertoire tends to be more triumphal and celebratory.\n-''Agrupaci\u00f3n Musical'' (Musical group/[[fanfare orchestra]]) - an intermediate form between the other two- used only for our Lord images.\n-''Musica de Capilla'' (Chapel music): Normally a wind quartet. Unlike the other music groups they precede the image they escort\n</ref>\nThose associated with the images of Christ are often funeral in nature, while those associated with the Virgin are more celebratory.\n\nAs each procession leaves its home church, (an event known as the ''salida''), at its return (the ''entrada''), and along the march route, improvised flamenco-style songs may be offered by individuals in the crowd or from a balcony. These songs are generically called ''saetas'' (arrows).\n\nWhenever the images depart or arrive at their home churches or chapels, [[Marcha Real]], the National Anthem, is played.\n\n===The Official Race===\nMany of the processions pass through an official viewing area which occupies some of the city's main streets, beginning in ''Campana'', followed by ''Calle Sierpes'', ''Plaza San Francisco'', and ''Avenida de la Constituci\u00f3n'', before reaching the [[Seville Cathedral|Cathedral]]. Due to the increasingly crowded schedule over the week, and also the urban growth of the city, a number of recently formed brotherhoods have to procession on [[Passion Week]] before [[Palm Sunday]] and do not march into the Cathedral at all.\n\n==Traditional Dress==\n\nThe traditional suit worn by women on Thursday (and sometimes on Good Friday) is known as ''La Mantilla'' (the mantle). This custom has become revitalised since the 1980s. The outfit consists of the lace mantle, stiffened by shell or another material, and a black dress, usually mid-leg, with black shoes. {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} It is expected for the woman to hold and show a rosary. Jewelry  may include, at most, bracelets and earrings. {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==The Days of Holy Week==\nBelow is a list of the brotherhoods which make penance each day, as of 2010, with the traditional year of establishment (or first procession to the Cathedral for those found in the last century), and a few notes. The names in the list are those in common usage.\n\nThey are ordered in the same sequence as they enter the Cathedral. Unlike other locations, this sequence is not related to the scenes of the Passion their images depict, but on a  historically grown set of rules of precedence, tradition, canonical needs, agreements between brotherhoods and logistical considerations.\n\nRain (or serious menace of) may affect the Processions, some may seek refuge to a nearby church or landmarks and wait for a perfect time to go back to their Church, or the Hermano Mayor may fully suspend the Procession.\nThere are 11 days of Holy Week as follows:\n\n===Friday of Pains===\n\n* ''Pino Montano''. \n\n* ''Pasi\u00f3n y Muerte'' (''Passion and Death''). 1991.\n* ''La Corona'' (''The Crown''). 1989\n* ''La Misi\u00f3n'' (''The Mission''). 1949.\n* ''Agrupaci\u00f3n Parroquial Bendici\u00f3n y Esperanza (Pol\u00edgono Sur)'' (''Parish Association Blessing and Hope''). 1992.\n\n===Saturday of Passion===\n\n* ''La Milagrosa (Ciudad Jard\u00edn)'' (''The Miraculous''). 1998.\n* ''Divino Perd\u00f3n (Parque Alcosa)'' (''Divine Forgiveness''). 1992.\n* ''Torreblanca'' (''WhiteTower''). 1961.\n* ''Padre P\u00edo'' (''Padre Pio''). 1986.\n* ''Agrupaci\u00f3n Parroquial Rosario (San Jer\u00f3nimo)'' (''Parish Association Rosary''). 2015.\n\n===Palm Sunday===\n* ''La Borriquita'' (''The Little She-Donkey'') depicting Christ\u2019s triumphal entry into Jerusalem.<ref name=Dykes/> The ''nazarenos'' corp is exclusively formed by children (except guardians and ''costaleros'').

Appearing as a single blue-white point of light to the [[naked eye]], the system contains at least four [[star]]s, the principal star of which is a [[Massive star|massive]] [[blue supergiant]] of [[Stellar classification#Modern classification|spectral type]] B8Ia. It is  calculated to be anywhere from 61,500 to 363,000 times [[Solar luminosity|as luminous]] as the Sun, and 18 to 24 times [[solar mass|as massive]], depending on the method used to calculate its properties and assumptions about its distance, estimated to be about {{convert|860|ly|pc|sigfig=2|lk=on}}. Its radius is over 70 times [[Solar radius|that of the Sun]], and its [[Surface temperature (star)|surface temperature]] is {{val|12,100|ul=K|fmt=commas}}. Rigel varies slightly in brightness, with [[apparent magnitude]] ranging from 0.05 to 0.18. Its [[Variable star#Intrinsic variable stars|intrinsic variability]] is caused by pulsations, and it is classified as an [[Alpha Cygni variable]]. Rigel is generally the [[list of brightest stars|seventh-brightest star]] in the [[night sky]] and the brightest star in Orion, though it is occasionally outshone by the more variable [[Betelgeuse]]. Rigel's mass-loss due to its [[stellar wind]] is estimated be around 10 million times more than that of the [[Sun]]. Estimated to be around 7 to 9 million years old, it has exhausted its core hydrogen fuel, expanded and cooled to become a supergiant, and will end its life as a [[type II supernova]].\n\nRigel (A) has a companion {{val|9.5|ul=arc seconds}} away with an apparent magnitude of 6.7, or 1/400th as bright. Often referred to as Rigel B or Rigel BC, this companion is actually a triple star system.  Two stars, components B and C, can be resolved by very large telescopes. The brighter of the two is a [[spectroscopic binary]], the components designated Ba and Bb. These three stars are [[B-type main-sequence star|blue-white main sequence stars]] each around three to four times as massive as the Sun. Rigel A and Rigel BC\u2014around 2,200 [[astronomical unit]]s distant from each other\u2014are thought to orbit around a common centre of gravity every 24,000 years. Rigel B and C orbit around each other every 63 years and Rigel Ba and Bb every 10 days. A fainter star, separated from the others by nearly an [[arc minute]], might be part of the same star system.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n[[File:Orion Head to Toe.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Bright points of light against a dark background with wisps of coloured nebulosity|[[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], with Rigel at bottom right, at optical wavelengths plus [[H\u03b1]] to emphasize gas clouds]]\n\nIn 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) included the name \"Rigel\" in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.<ref name=\"IAU-CSN\"/><ref name=\"WGSN2018\"/> According to the IAU, this proper name applies only to the primary component A of the Rigel system. In historical [[astronomical catalogs]], the system is listed variously as [[Herschel Catalogue of Double Stars|H&nbsp;II]]&nbsp;33, [[Struve Double Star Catalog|\u03a3]]&nbsp;668, [[Burnham Double Star Catalogue|\u03b2]]&nbsp;555, or [[Aitken Double Star Catalogue|ADS]]&nbsp;3823.

The \"beta\" designation is commonly given to the second-brightest star in each constellation, but Rigel is almost always brighter than \u03b1 Orionis ([[Betelgeuse]]).<ref name=\"schaaf\"/> Astronomer [[James B. Kaler]] has speculated that Rigel was designated by Bayer during a rare period when it was outshone by the variable star Betelgeuse, resulting in the latter star being designated \"alpha\" and Rigel designated \"beta\".<ref name=\"kalerrigel\"/> However, Bayer did not strictly order the stars by brightness; rather he grouped them by magnitude class and then ordered the stars within each class according to a different scheme.<ref name=ridpath>{{cite book |first=Ian |last=Ridpath |title=Star Tales |chapter=Bayer's ''Uranometria'' and Bayer letters  |publisher=Lutterworth Press | location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-7188-2695-6 |chapter-url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer.htm}}</ref>  Rigel and Betelgeuse were both considered to be of the first magnitude class, and in Orion the stars of each class are thought to have been ordered north to south.<ref>{{cite book|first=Patrick|last= Moore|title=Brilliant Stars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWEOGwAACAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Cassell| location=London | isbn=978-0-304-34903-6}}</ref>  Rigel is included in the [[General Catalogue of Variable Stars]], but since it already has a [[Bayer designation]] it has no separate [[variable star designation]].<ref name=baa/>\n\nRigel has many other [[Stellar designations and names|stellar designations]] taken from various catalogues, including the [[Flamsteed designation]] 19&nbsp;Orionis (19 Ori), the [[Bright Star Catalogue]] entry HR&nbsp;1713, and the [[Henry Draper Catalogue]] number HD&nbsp;34085. These designations frequently appear in the scientific literature,<ref name=msc/><ref name=schultz/><ref name=markova/> but rarely in popular writing.<ref name=garfinkle1997/><ref name=burnham/>\n\n==Observation==\nRigel is an [[Variable star|intrinsic variable]] star with an [[apparent magnitude]] ranging from 0.05 to 0.18.<ref name=guinan/> It is typically the seventh-brightest star in the [[celestial sphere]], excluding the Sun, although occasionally fainter than Betelgeuse.<ref name=burnham/> It is fainter than [[Capella]], which may also vary slightly in brightness.<ref name=Samus2017/> Rigel appears slightly blue-white and has a [[B-V color]] index of \u22120.06.<ref name=\"csiro\"/> It contrasts strongly with reddish Betelgeuse.<ref name=DK/>\n\n[[Culmination|Culminating]] every year at [[midnight]] on 12 December, and at 9 pm on 24 January, Rigel is visible on winter evenings in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and on summer evenings in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"schaaf\"/> In the Southern Hemisphere, Rigel is the first bright star of Orion visible as the constellation rises.<ref name=ellyard/> The star is a vertex of the \"[[Winter Hexagon]]\", an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] that includes [[Aldebaran]], Capella, [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]], [[Procyon]], and [[Sirius]]. Rigel is a prominent equatorial [[navigation star]], being easily located and readily visible in all the world's oceans (the exception is the area north of the [[82nd parallel north]]).<ref name=kerigan/>\n\n=== Spectroscopy ===\nRigel's [[Stellar classification#Modern classification|spectral type]] is a defining point of the classification sequence for supergiants.<ref name=morgan1978/><ref name=morgan1950/> The overall spectrum is typical for a [[Late-type star|late]] B class star, with strong [[absorption line]]s of the hydrogen [[Balmer series]] together with neutral helium lines and some of heavier elements such as oxygen, calcium, and magnesium.<ref name=abetti/> The [[luminosity class]] for B8 stars is estimated from the strength and narrowness of the hydrogen spectral lines, and Rigel is assigned to the [[bright supergiant]] class Ia.<ref name=mkk/> Variations in the spectrum have resulted in the assignment of different classes to Rigel, such as B8 Ia, B8 Iab, and B8 Iae.<ref name=schultz/><ref name=bally/>\n\nAs early as 1888, the heliocentric [[radial velocity]] of Rigel, as estimated from the [[Doppler shift]]s of its spectral lines, was seen to vary. This was confirmed and interpreted at the time as being due to a spectroscopic companion with a period of about 22 days.<ref name=plaskett/> The radial velocity has since been measured to vary by about {{val|10|ul=km/s}} around a mean of {{val|21.5|u=km/s}}.<ref name=morrison/>\n\nIn 1933, the [[H\u03b1]] line in Rigel's spectrum was seen to be unusually weak and shifted {{val|0.1|ul=nm}} towards shorter wavelengths, while there was a narrow [[emission line|emission spike]] about {{val|1.5|u=nm}} to the long wavelength side of the main absorption line.<ref name=struve/> This is now known as a [[P Cygni profile]] after a star that shows this feature strongly in its spectrum. It is associated with [[mass loss]] where there is simultaneously emission from a dense wind close to the star and absorption from circumstellar material expanding away from the star.<ref name=struve/>\n\nThe unusual H\u03b1 line profile is observed to vary unpredictably. Around a third of the time it is a normal absorption line. About a quarter of the time it is a double-peaked line, that is an absorption line with an emission core or an emission line with an absorption core. About a quarter of the time it has a P Cygni profile; most of the rest of the time the line has an inverse P Cygni profile, where the emission component is on the short wavelength side of the line. Rarely, there is a pure emission H\u03b1 line.<ref name=morrison/><!-- cites 5 previous sentences --> The line profile changes are interpreted as variations in the quantity and velocity of material being expelled from the star. Occasional very high-velocity outflows have been inferred, and, more rarely, infalling material. The overall picture is one of large [[coronal loop|looping structures]] arising from the [[photosphere]] and driven by magnetic fields.<ref name=israelian/>\n\n=== Variability ===\nRigel has been known to vary in brightness since at least 1930. The small amplitude of Rigel's brightness variation requires [[Photoelectric sensor|photoelectric]] or [[CCD photometry]] to be reliably detected. These brightness changes have no obvious period. Observations over 18 nights in 1984 showed variations at red, blue, and yellow wavelengths of up to 0.13 magnitudes on timescales of a few hours to several days, but again no clear period. Rigel's [[colour index]] varies slightly but is not strongly correlated with its brightness variations.<ref name=guinan1985/>\n\nFrom analysis of ''[[Hipparcos]]'' satellite photometry, Rigel is identified as belonging to the [[Alpha Cygni variable|Alpha Cygni]] class of variable stars,<ref name=\"waelkens 1998\"/> defined as \"non-radially pulsating supergiants of the Bep\u2013AepIa spectral types\".<ref name=Samus2017/> In those spectral types, the 'e' indicates that it displays emission lines in its spectrum, while the 'p' means it has an unspecified spectral peculiarity. Alpha Cygni type variables are generally considered to be irregular<ref name=AAVSOvartyps/> or have [[quasi-period]]s.<ref name=vangenderen/> Rigel was added to the General Catalogue of Variable Stars in the 74th name-list of variable stars on the basis of the Hipparcos photometry,<ref name=IBVS/> which showed variations with a photographic amplitude of 0.039 magnitudes and a possible period of 2.075 days.<ref name=lefevre/> Rigel was observed with the Canadian [[Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope|MOST]] satellite for nearly 28 days in 2009. Milli-magnitude variations were observed, and gradual changes in flux suggest the presence of long-period pulsation modes.<ref name=apj2012_747_108/>\n\n=== Mass loss ===\nFrom observations of the variable H\u03b1 spectral line, Rigel's mass-loss rate due to stellar wind is estimated be {{val|1.5|0.4|e=\u22127}} solar masses per year ({{solar mass|link=n}}/yr)\u2014around 10 million times more than the mass-loss rate from the [[Sun]].<ref name=chesneau2010/> More detailed optical and [[K band (infrared)|K band]] infrared spectroscopic observations, together with [[VLTI]] interferometry, were taken from 2006 to 2010. Analysis of the H\u03b1 and [[H\u03b3]] line profiles, and measurement of the regions producing the lines, show that Rigel's stellar wind varies greatly in structure and strength. Loop and arm structures were also detected within the wind. Calculations of mass loss from the H\u03b3 line give {{val|9.4|0.9|e=\u22127|u={{solar mass}}/yr}} in 2006-7 and {{val|7.6|1.1|e=\u22127|u={{solar mass}}/yr}} in 2009\u201310. Calculations using the H\u03b1 line give lower results, around {{val|1.5|e=\u22127|u={{solar mass}}/yr}}. The terminal wind velocity is {{val|300|u=km/s}}.<ref name=chesneau2014/> It is estimated that Rigel has lost around 3 solar masses ({{solar mass}}) since beginning life as a star of {{val|24|3|u={{solar mass}}}} 7 to 9 million years ago.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/>\n\n==Distance==\n[[File:Treasures3.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A very bright blue-white star with fainter stars near a sharply-defined strip of nebulosity|Rigel and [[reflection nebula]] [[IC 2118]] in [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]]. Rigel B is not visible in the glare of the main star.]]\nRigel's distance from the Sun is somewhat uncertain, with different estimates obtained by different methods. The 2007 [[Hipparcos new reduction]] of Rigel's [[stellar parallax|parallax]] is {{val|3.78|0.34|ul=mas}}, giving a distance of {{convert|863|ly|pc|abbr=off}} with a [[margin of error]] of about 9%.<ref name=aaa474_2_653/> Rigel B, usually considered to be physically associated with Rigel and at the same distance, has a [[Gaia Data Release 2]] parallax of {{val|2.9186|0.0761|u=mas}}, suggesting a distance around {{convert|340|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}. However, the measurements for this object may be unreliable.<ref name=dr2b/>\n\nIndirect distance estimation methods have also been employed. For example, Rigel is believed to be in a region of [[nebulosity]], with its radiation illuminating several nearby clouds. Most notable of these is the 5\u00b0-long [[IC 2118]] (Witch Head Nebula),<ref name=Guieu2010/><ref name=\"Jedicke1992\"/> located at an [[angular separation]] of 2.5\u00b0 from the star,<ref name=Guieu2010/> or a projected distance of {{convert|12|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} away.<ref name=\"kalerrigel\"/> From measures of other nebula-embedded stars, IC&nbsp;2118's distance is estimated to be {{convert|291|\u00b1|2|pc|ly|0|abbr=off|order=flip}}.<ref name=Kounkel2018/>\n\nRigel is an outlying member of the [[Orion OB1 Association]], which is located at a distance of up to {{convert|500|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} from Earth. It is a member of the loosely-defined [[Taurus-Orion R1 Association]], somewhat closer at {{convert|360|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}.<ref name=markova/><ref name=racine/> Rigel is thought to be considerably closer than most of the members of Orion OB1 and the [[Orion Nebula]]. Betelgeuse and [[Saiph]] lie at a similar distance to Rigel, although Betelgeuse is a [[runaway star]] with a complex history and might have originally formed in the main body of the association.<ref name=bally/>\n\n== Stellar system ==\n<div style=\"float:left; width:240px; border:solid black 1px; text-align: center; margin: 8px; padding: 4px; font-size: 90%;\">\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart|border=1|  |, |S1|  |S1='''Rigel''' }}\n{{chart|border=0|  |! |PA|PA=Separation=9.5\u2033<br/>Period=24,000&nbsp;y }} \n{{chart|border=1|-|( |  |, |- |S2|S2='''Ba''' }}\n{{chart|border=0|  |! |, |( |PB|PB=Separation={{val|0.58|u=mas}}<br/>Period={{Val|9.860|u=days}} }}\n{{chart|border=1|  |! |! |` |- |S3|S3='''Bb''' }}\n{{chart|border=0|  |` |( |PC|PC=Separation={{Val|0.1|u=arcsecond}}<br/>Period=63&nbsp;y }}\n{{chart|border=1|  |  |` |S4|  |S4='''C''' }}\n{{chart/end}}\n[[Star systems#Designations and nomenclature|Hierarchical scheme]] for Rigel's components<ref name=msc/> \n<!--This hierarchy structure separates stars into subsystems which are assumed to be gravitationally attached.

Since its discovery, there has been no sign of orbital motion, although both stars share a similar [[proper motion|common proper motion]].<ref name=\"Jedicke1992\" /><ref name=sb9/> The pair would have an estimated orbital period of around 24,000&nbsp;years.<ref name=msc/> Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) contains a somewhat unreliable parallax for Rigel B, placing it at about {{convert|340|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}, further away than the Hipparcos distance for Rigel, but similar to the Taurus-Orion R1 association. There is no parallax for Rigel in Gaia DR2. The Gaia DR2 proper motions for Rigel B and the Hipparcos proper motions for Rigel are both small, although not quite the same.<ref name=dr2b/>\n\nIn 1871, [[Sherburne Wesley Burnham]] suspected Rigel B to be a binary system, and in 1878, he resolved it into two components.<ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> This visual companion is designated as component C (Rigel C), with a measured separation from component B that varies from less than {{val|0.1|u=\"}} to around {{val|0.3|u=\"}}.<ref name=WDS/><ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> In 2009, [[speckle interferometric|speckle interferometry]] showed the two almost identical components separated by {{val|0.124|u=\"}},<ref name=mason/> with visual magnitudes of 7.5 and 7.6 respectively.<ref name=WDS/> Their estimated orbital period is 63&nbsp;years.<ref name=msc/> Burnham listed the Rigel multiple system as \u03b2&nbsp;555 in his double star catalogue<ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> or BU&nbsp;555 in modern use.<ref name=WDS/>\n\nComponent B is a double-lined [[spectroscopic binary]] system, which shows two sets of [[spectral line]]s combined within its single [[stellar spectrum]]. Periodic changes observed in relative positions of these lines indicate an orbital period of 9.86&nbsp;days. The two spectroscopic components Rigel Ba and Rigel Bb cannot be resolved in optical telescopes but are known to both be hot stars of spectral type around B9. This spectroscopic binary, together with the close visual component Rigel C, is likely a physical triple star system,<ref name=sb9/> although Rigel C cannot be detected in the spectrum which is inconsistent with its observed brightness.<ref name=sanford/>\n\nIn 1878, Burnham found another possibly associated star of approximately 13th magnitude. He listed it as component D of \u03b2&nbsp;555,<ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> although it is unclear whether it is physically related or a coincidental alignment.  Its 2017 separation from Rigel was {{val|44.5|ul=\"}} almost due north at a position angle of 1\u00b0.<ref name=WDS/>  Gaia DR2 finds it to be a 12th magnitude sunlike star<!-- Does \"orange dwarf\" count as \"sunlike\"? --> at approximately the same distance as Rigel.<ref name=dr2d/> Likely a [[K-type main-sequence star]], this star would have an orbital period of around 250,000 years, if it is part of the Rigel system.<ref name=\"kalerrigel\"/> A spectroscopic companion to Rigel was reported on the basis of radial velocity variations, and its orbit was even calculated, but subsequent work suggests that the star does not exist and that observed pulsations are intrinsic to Rigel itself.<ref name=sb9/>\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n[[File:Hertzsprung-Russel StarData.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=A chart showing several labelled stars against shaded coloured areas with axes of spectral type and absolute magnitude|Rigel's place at top-center on the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]]]]\nRigel is a [[blue supergiant]] that has exhausted the hydrogen fuel in its core, expanded and cooled as it moved away from the [[main sequence]] across the upper part of the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]].<ref name=guinan/><ref name=seeds/> When it was on the main sequence, its [[effective temperature]] would have been around {{val|30,000|fmt=commas|ul=K}}.<ref name=saio/> Rigel's complex variability at [[Electromagnetic spectrum|visual wavelengths]] is caused by [[stellar pulsations]] similar to those of [[Deneb]]. Additional observations of radial velocity variations indicate that it simultaneously oscillates in at least 19 non-radial modes with periods ranging from about 1.2 to 74 days.<ref name=apj2012_747_108/>\n\nEstimation of many physical characteristics of blue supergiant stars, including Rigel, is challenging due to their rarity and uncertainty about how far they are from the Sun. As such, their characteristics are mainly estimated from theoretical [[Stellar evolution#Models|stellar evolution models]].<ref name=demarque2008/>  However, its effective temperature can be determined from the spectral type and colour to be around {{val|12,100|fmt=commas|ul=K}}.<ref name=przybilla/> A mass of {{val|21|3|u=solar mass}} at an age of {{val|8|1}} million years has been determined by comparing evolutionary tracks, while atmospheric modelling from the spectrum gives a mass of {{solar mass|{{val|24|8}}}}.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/>\n\nAlthough Rigel is often considered the most luminous star within 1,000 light-years of the Sun,<ref name=\"schaaf\" /><ref name=burnham/> its energy output is poorly known. Using the Hipparcos distance of {{convert|264|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}, the estimated relative luminosity for Rigel is about 120,000 times that of the Sun ({{solar luminosity|link=y}}),<ref name=apj2012_747_108/> but another recently published distance of {{convert|360|\u00b1|40|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} suggests an even higher luminosity of {{solar luminosity|219,000}}.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/> Other calculations based on theoretical stellar evolutionary models of Rigel's atmosphere give luminosities anywhere between {{solar luminosity|83,000}} and {{solar luminosity|363,000}},<ref name=markova/> while summing the [[spectral energy distribution]] from historical photometry with the Hipparcos distance suggests a luminosity as low as {{val|61515|11486|u={{solar luminosity}}|fmt=commas}}.<ref name=baines/> A 2018 study using the [[Navy Precision Optical Interferometer]] measured the [[angular diameter]] as {{val|2.526|u=mas}}. After correcting for [[limb darkening]], the angular diameter is found to be {{val|2.606|0.009|u=mas}}, yielding a radius of {{solar radius|{{val|74.1|+6.1|-7.3}}|link=y}}.<ref name=baines/> An older measurement of the angular diameter gives {{val|2.75|0.01|u=mas}},<ref name=auf/> equivalent to a radius {{solar radius|78.9}} at {{val|264|u=pc}}.<ref name=apj2012_747_108/>  These radii are calculated assuming the Hipparcos distance of {{val|264|u=pc}}; adopting a distance of {{val|360|u=pc}} leads to a significantly larger size.<ref name=chesneau2014/>\n\nDue to their closeness to each other and ambiguity of the spectrum, little is known about the individual intrinsic properties of the members of the Rigel BC triple system. All three stars seem to be near equally hot [[B-type main-sequence star]]s that are 3 to 4 times as massive as the Sun.<ref name=msc/>\n\n== Evolution ==\n[[Stellar evolution]] models suggest that the pulsations of Rigel are powered by nuclear reactions in a hydrogen-burning shell that is at least partially non-convective. These pulsations are stronger and more numerous in stars that have evolved through a [[red supergiant]] phase and then increased in temperature to again become a blue supergiant.  This is due to the decreased mass and increased levels of fusion products at the surface of the star.<ref name=saio/>\n\nRigel is likely to be [[Triple-alpha process|fusing helium]] in its core.<ref name=apj2012_749_74 /> Due to strong convection of helium produced in the core while Rigel was on the main sequence and in the hydrogen-burning shell since it became a supergiant, the fraction of helium at the surface has increased from 26.6% when the star formed to 32% now.  The surface abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen seen in the spectrum are compatible with a post-red supergiant star only if its internal convection zones are modelled using non-homogeneous chemical conditions known as the [[Paul_Ledoux#Ledoux_criterion|Ledoux Criteria]].<ref name=saio/>\n\nRigel is expected to eventually end its stellar life as a type II [[supernova]].<ref name=apj2012_749_74/> It is one of the closest known potential supernova progenitors to Earth,<ref name=apj2012_747_108/> and would be expected to have a maximum apparent magnitude of around {{val|-11}} (about the same brightness as a quarter Moon or around 300 times brighter than Venus ever gets.)<ref name=guinan/>\n\n==Etymology and cultural significance==\nThe earliest known recording of the modern name ''Rigel'' is in the ''[[Alfonsine tables]]'' of 1521. It is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name ''{{transl|ar|Rijl Jauzah al Yusr\u0101}}'', \"the left leg (foot) of Jauzah\" (i.e. ''rijl'' meaning \"leg, foot\"),<ref name=allen/> which can be traced to the 10th century.<ref name=\"KUNITZSCH1959\"/> \"Jauzah\" was a proper name for Orion; an alternative Arabic name was {{lang|ar|\u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0628\u0627\u0631}} ''{{transl|ar|rijl al-jabb\u0101r}}'', \"the foot of the great one\", from which stems the rarely used variant names ''Algebar'' or ''Elgebar''. The ''Alphonsine tables'' saw its name split into \"Rigel\" and \"Algebar\", with the note, ''et dicitur Algebar. Nominatur etiam Rigel.''<ref name=Kunitzsch86/> Alternate spellings from the 17th century include ''Regel'' by Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]], ''Riglon'' by German astronomer [[Wilhelm Schickard]], and ''Rigel Algeuze'' or ''Algibbar'' by English scholar [[Edmund Chilmead]].<ref name=\"allen\"/>\n\nWith the constellation representing the mythological Greek huntsman [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], Rigel is his knee or (as its name suggests) foot; with the nearby star [[Beta Eridani]] marking Orion's footstool.<ref name=\"schaaf\"/> Rigel is presumably the star known as \"[[Aurvandil]]'s toe\" in [[Norse mythology]].<ref name=cleasby/> In the Caribbean, Rigel represented the severed leg of the folkloric figure ''Trois Rois'', himself represented by the three stars of Orion's Belt. The leg had been severed with a cutlass by the maiden ''B\u012fhi'' (Sirius).<ref name=taylor/> The [[Lacandon]] people of southern [[Mexico]] knew it as ''tunsel'' (\"little woodpecker\").<ref name=milbraith/>\n\nRigel was known as ''Yerrerdet-kurrk'' to the [[Wotjobaluk]] [[koori]] of southeastern Australia, and held to be the mother-in-law of ''Totyerguil'' ([[Altair]]). The distance between them signified the taboo preventing a man from approaching his mother-in-law.<ref name=mudrooroo/> The indigenous [[Wergaia|Boorong]] people of northwestern Victoria named Rigel as ''Collowgullouric Warepil''.<ref name=hamacher/> The [[Wardaman people]] of northern Australia know Rigel as the Red [[Kangaroo]] Leader ''Unumburrgu'' and chief conductor of ceremonies in a songline when Orion is high in the sky. [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]], the river, marks a line of stars in the sky leading to it, and the other stars of Orion are his ceremonial tools and entourage. Betelgeuse is ''Ya-jungin'' \"Owl Eyes Flicking\", watching the ceremonies.<ref name=harney/>\n\nThe [[M\u0101ori people]] of New Zealand named Rigel as ''[[Puanga]]'', said to be a daughter of ''Rehua'' ([[Antares]]), the chief of all stars.<ref name=parker/> Its [[heliacal rising]] presages the appearance of ''[[Matariki]]'' (the [[Pleiades]]) in the dawn sky, marking the M\u0101ori New Year in late May or early June. The [[Moriori people]] of the [[Chatham Islands]], as well as some Maori groups in New Zealand, mark the start of their New Year with Rigel rather than the Pleiades.<ref name=\"kelley\"/> ''Puaka'' is a local variant used in the South Island.<ref name=\"Best22\"/> In [[Japan]], the Minamoto or [[Genji clan]] chose Rigel and its white color as its symbol, calling the star ''Genji-boshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u6e90\u6c0f\u661f}}), while the Taira or [[Heike clan]] adopted Betelgeuse and its red color. The two powerful families fought the [[Genpei War]]; the stars were seen as facing off against each other and only kept apart by the three stars of [[Orion's Belt]].<ref name=\"RENSHAW1\"/><ref name=daijirin/><ref name=hojiri/>\n\n==In modern culture==\n{{see also|Rigel in fiction}}\nThe [[MS Rigel|MS ''Rigel'']] was originally a Norwegian ship, built in Copenhagen in 1924.

to '''Beta Orionis''', abbreviated '''Beta Ori''', '''\u03b2 Ori'''), is the name applied to a [[star system]] in the [[constellation]] of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], and strictly to the system's brightest star. Appearing as a single blue-white point of light to the [[naked eye]], the system contains at least four [[star]]s, the principal star of which is a [[Massive star|massive]] [[blue supergiant]] of [[Stellar classification#Modern classification|spectral type]] B8Ia. It is  calculated to be anywhere from 61,500 to 363,000 times [[Solar luminosity|as luminous]] as the Sun, and 18 to 24 times [[solar mass|as massive]], depending on the method used to calculate its properties and assumptions about its distance, estimated to be about {{convert|860|ly|pc|sigfig=2|lk=on}}. Its radius is over 70 times [[Solar radius|that of the Sun]], and its [[Surface temperature (star)|surface temperature]] is {{val|12,100|ul=K|fmt=commas}}. Rigel varies slightly in brightness, with [[apparent magnitude]] ranging from 0.05 to 0.18. Its [[Variable star#Intrinsic variable stars|intrinsic variability]] is caused by pulsations, and it is classified as an [[Alpha Cygni variable]]. Rigel is generally the [[list of brightest stars|seventh-brightest star]] in the [[night sky]] and the brightest star in Orion, though it is occasionally outshone by the more variable [[Betelgeuse]]. Rigel's mass-loss due to its [[stellar wind]] is estimated be around 10 million times more than that of the [[Sun]]. Estimated to be around 7 to 9 million years old, it has exhausted its core hydrogen fuel, expanded and cooled to become a supergiant, and will end its life as a [[type II supernova]].\n\nRigel (A) has a companion {{val|9.5|ul=arc seconds}} away with an apparent magnitude of 6.7, or 1/400th as bright. Often referred to as Rigel B or Rigel BC, this companion is actually a triple star system.  Two stars, components B and C, can be resolved by very large telescopes. The brighter of the two is a [[spectroscopic binary]], the components designated Ba and Bb. These three stars are [[B-type main-sequence star|blue-white main sequence stars]] each around three to four times as massive as the Sun. Rigel A and Rigel BC\u2014around 2,200 [[astronomical unit]]s distant from each other\u2014are thought to orbit around a common centre of gravity every 24,000 years. Rigel B and C orbit around each other every 63 years and Rigel Ba and Bb every 10 days. A fainter star, separated from the others by nearly an [[arc minute]], might be part of the same star system.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n[[File:Orion Head to Toe.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Bright points of light against a dark background with wisps of coloured nebulosity|[[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], with Rigel at bottom right, at optical wavelengths plus [[H\u03b1]] to emphasize gas clouds]]\n\nIn 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) included the name \"Rigel\" in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.<ref name=\"IAU-CSN\"/><ref name=\"WGSN2018\"/> According to the IAU, this proper name applies only to the primary component A of the Rigel system.

The \"beta\" designation is commonly given to the second-brightest star in each constellation, but Rigel is almost always brighter than \u03b1 Orionis ([[Betelgeuse]]).<ref name=\"schaaf\"/> Astronomer [[James B.

This was confirmed and interpreted at the time as being due to a spectroscopic companion with a period of about 22 days.<ref name=plaskett/> The radial velocity has since been measured to vary by about {{val|10|ul=km/s}} around a mean of {{val|21.5|u=km/s}}.<ref name=morrison/>\n\nIn 1933, the [[H\u03b1]] line in Rigel's spectrum was seen to be unusually weak and shifted {{val|0.1|ul=nm}} towards shorter wavelengths, while there was a narrow [[emission line|emission spike]] about {{val|1.5|u=nm}} to the long wavelength side of the main absorption line.<ref name=struve/> This is now known as a [[P Cygni profile]] after a star that shows this feature strongly in its spectrum. It is associated with [[mass loss]] where there is simultaneously emission from a dense wind close to the star and absorption from circumstellar material expanding away from the star.<ref name=struve/>\n\nThe unusual H\u03b1 line profile is observed to vary unpredictably. Around a third of the time it is a normal absorption line. About a quarter of the time it is a double-peaked line, that is an absorption line with an emission core or an emission line with an absorption core. About a quarter of the time it has a P Cygni profile; most of the rest of the time the line has an inverse P Cygni profile, where the emission component is on the short wavelength side of the line. Rarely, there is a pure emission H\u03b1 line.<ref name=morrison/><!-- cites 5 previous sentences --> The line profile changes are interpreted as variations in the quantity and velocity of material being expelled from the star. Occasional very high-velocity outflows have been inferred, and, more rarely, infalling material. The overall picture is one of large [[coronal loop|looping structures]] arising from the [[photosphere]] and driven by magnetic fields.<ref name=israelian/>\n\n=== Variability ===\nRigel has been known to vary in brightness since at least 1930. The small amplitude of Rigel's brightness variation requires [[Photoelectric sensor|photoelectric]] or [[CCD photometry]] to be reliably detected. These brightness changes have no obvious period. Observations over 18 nights in 1984 showed variations at red, blue, and yellow wavelengths of up to 0.13 magnitudes on timescales of a few hours to several days, but again no clear period. Rigel's [[colour index]] varies slightly but is not strongly correlated with its brightness variations.<ref name=guinan1985/>\n\nFrom analysis of ''[[Hipparcos]]'' satellite photometry, Rigel is identified as belonging to the [[Alpha Cygni variable|Alpha Cygni]] class of variable stars,<ref name=\"waelkens 1998\"/> defined as \"non-radially pulsating supergiants of the Bep\u2013AepIa spectral types\".<ref name=Samus2017/> In those spectral types, the 'e' indicates that it displays emission lines in its spectrum, while the 'p' means it has an unspecified spectral peculiarity. Alpha Cygni type variables are generally considered to be irregular<ref name=AAVSOvartyps/> or have [[quasi-period]]s.<ref name=vangenderen/> Rigel was added to the General Catalogue of Variable Stars in the 74th name-list of variable stars on the basis of the Hipparcos photometry,<ref name=IBVS/> which showed variations with a photographic amplitude of 0.039 magnitudes and a possible period of 2.075 days.<ref name=lefevre/> Rigel was observed with the Canadian [[Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope|MOST]] satellite for nearly 28 days in 2009. Milli-magnitude variations were observed, and gradual changes in flux suggest the presence of long-period pulsation modes.<ref name=apj2012_747_108/>\n\n=== Mass loss ===\nFrom observations of the variable H\u03b1 spectral line, Rigel's mass-loss rate due to stellar wind is estimated be {{val|1.5|0.4|e=\u22127}} solar masses per year ({{solar mass|link=n}}/yr)\u2014around 10 million times more than the mass-loss rate from the [[Sun]].<ref name=chesneau2010/> More detailed optical and [[K band (infrared)|K band]] infrared spectroscopic observations, together with [[VLTI]] interferometry, were taken from 2006 to 2010. Analysis of the H\u03b1 and [[H\u03b3]] line profiles, and measurement of the regions producing the lines, show that Rigel's stellar wind varies greatly in structure and strength. Loop and arm structures were also detected within the wind. Calculations of mass loss from the H\u03b3 line give {{val|9.4|0.9|e=\u22127|u={{solar mass}}/yr}} in 2006-7 and {{val|7.6|1.1|e=\u22127|u={{solar mass}}/yr}} in 2009\u201310. Calculations using the H\u03b1 line give lower results, around {{val|1.5|e=\u22127|u={{solar mass}}/yr}}. The terminal wind velocity is {{val|300|u=km/s}}.<ref name=chesneau2014/> It is estimated that Rigel has lost around 3 solar masses ({{solar mass}}) since beginning life as a star of {{val|24|3|u={{solar mass}}}} 7 to 9 million years ago.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/>\n\n==Distance==\n[[File:Treasures3.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A very bright blue-white star with fainter stars near a sharply-defined strip of nebulosity|Rigel and [[reflection nebula]] [[IC 2118]] in [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]]. Rigel B is not visible in the glare of the main star.]]\nRigel's distance from the Sun is somewhat uncertain, with different estimates obtained by different methods. The 2007 [[Hipparcos new reduction]] of Rigel's [[stellar parallax|parallax]] is {{val|3.78|0.34|ul=mas}}, giving a distance of {{convert|863|ly|pc|abbr=off}} with a [[margin of error]] of about 9%.<ref name=aaa474_2_653/> Rigel B, usually considered to be physically associated with Rigel and at the same distance, has a [[Gaia Data Release 2]] parallax of {{val|2.9186|0.0761|u=mas}}, suggesting a distance around {{convert|340|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}. However, the measurements for this object may be unreliable.<ref name=dr2b/>\n\nIndirect distance estimation methods have also been employed. For example, Rigel is believed to be in a region of [[nebulosity]], with its radiation illuminating several nearby clouds. Most notable of these is the 5\u00b0-long [[IC 2118]] (Witch Head Nebula),<ref name=Guieu2010/><ref name=\"Jedicke1992\"/> located at an [[angular separation]] of 2.5\u00b0 from the star,<ref name=Guieu2010/> or a projected distance of {{convert|12|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} away.<ref name=\"kalerrigel\"/> From measures of other nebula-embedded stars, IC&nbsp;2118's distance is estimated to be {{convert|291|\u00b1|2|pc|ly|0|abbr=off|order=flip}}.<ref name=Kounkel2018/>\n\nRigel is an outlying member of the [[Orion OB1 Association]], which is located at a distance of up to {{convert|500|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} from Earth. It is a member of the loosely-defined [[Taurus-Orion R1 Association]], somewhat closer at {{convert|360|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}.<ref name=markova/><ref name=racine/> Rigel is thought to be considerably closer than most of the members of Orion OB1 and the [[Orion Nebula]]. Betelgeuse and [[Saiph]] lie at a similar distance to Rigel, although Betelgeuse is a [[runaway star]] with a complex history and might have originally formed in the main body of the association.<ref name=bally/>\n\n== Stellar system ==\n<div style=\"float:left; width:240px; border:solid black 1px; text-align: center; margin: 8px; padding: 4px; font-size: 90%;\">\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart|border=1|  |, |S1|  |S1='''Rigel''' }}\n{{chart|border=0|  |! |PA|PA=Separation=9.5\u2033<br/>Period=24,000&nbsp;y }} \n{{chart|border=1|-|( |  |, |- |S2|S2='''Ba''' }}\n{{chart|border=0|  |! |, |( |PB|PB=Separation={{val|0.58|u=mas}}<br/>Period={{Val|9.860|u=days}} }}\n{{chart|border=1|  |! |! |` |- |S3|S3='''Bb''' }}\n{{chart|border=0|  |` |( |PC|PC=Separation={{Val|0.1|u=arcsecond}}<br/>Period=63&nbsp;y }}\n{{chart|border=1|  |  |` |S4|  |S4='''C''' }}\n{{chart/end}}\n[[Star systems#Designations and nomenclature|Hierarchical scheme]] for Rigel's components<ref name=msc/> \n<!--This hierarchy structure separates stars into subsystems which are assumed to be gravitationally attached.

The blue supergiant primary (Rigel A) has a [[Visual double star|visual companion]], which is likely a close triple star system. A fainter star at a wider separation might also be a fifth component of the Rigel system.\n\n[[William Herschel]] discovered Rigel to be a visual double star on 1 October 1781, cataloguing it as star 33 in the \"second class of double stars\" in his Catalogue of Double Stars,<ref name=\"Herschel1782\"/> usually abbreviated to H&nbsp;II&nbsp;33, or as H&nbsp;2&nbsp;33 in the Washington Double Star Catalogue.<ref name=\"WDS\"/>  [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve]] first measured the relative position of the companion in 1822, cataloguing the visual pair as \u03a3 668.<ref name=FGWStruve/><ref name=\"Webb1917\"/> The secondary star is often referred to as Rigel B or \u03b2 Orionis B. The angular separation of Rigel B from Rigel A is 9.5 arc seconds to its south along [[position angle]] 204\u00b0.<ref name=\"WDS\"/><ref name=bakich/> Although not particularly faint at [[visual magnitude]] 6.7, the overall difference in brightness from Rigel A (about 6.6 magnitudes or 440 times fainter) makes it a challenging target for telescope apertures smaller than {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}.<ref name=sanford/>\n\nAt Rigel's estimated distance, Rigel B's [[projected separation]] from Rigel A is over 2,200&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s (AU). Since its discovery, there has been no sign of orbital motion, although both stars share a similar [[proper motion|common proper motion]].<ref name=\"Jedicke1992\" /><ref name=sb9/> The pair would have an estimated orbital period of around 24,000&nbsp;years.<ref name=msc/> Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) contains a somewhat unreliable parallax for Rigel B, placing it at about {{convert|340|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}, further away than the Hipparcos distance for Rigel, but similar to the Taurus-Orion R1 association. There is no parallax for Rigel in Gaia DR2. The Gaia DR2 proper motions for Rigel B and the Hipparcos proper motions for Rigel are both small, although not quite the same.<ref name=dr2b/>\n\nIn 1871, [[Sherburne Wesley Burnham]] suspected Rigel B to be a binary system, and in 1878, he resolved it into two components.<ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> This visual companion is designated as component C (Rigel C), with a measured separation from component B that varies from less than {{val|0.1|u=\"}} to around {{val|0.3|u=\"}}.<ref name=WDS/><ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> In 2009, [[speckle interferometric|speckle interferometry]] showed the two almost identical components separated by {{val|0.124|u=\"}},<ref name=mason/> with visual magnitudes of 7.5 and 7.6 respectively.<ref name=WDS/> Their estimated orbital period is 63&nbsp;years.<ref name=msc/> Burnham listed the Rigel multiple system as \u03b2&nbsp;555 in his double star catalogue<ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> or BU&nbsp;555 in modern use.<ref name=WDS/>\n\nComponent B is a double-lined [[spectroscopic binary]] system, which shows two sets of [[spectral line]]s combined within its single [[stellar spectrum]]. Periodic changes observed in relative positions of these lines indicate an orbital period of 9.86&nbsp;days. The two spectroscopic components Rigel Ba and Rigel Bb cannot be resolved in optical telescopes but are known to both be hot stars of spectral type around B9. This spectroscopic binary, together with the close visual component Rigel C, is likely a physical triple star system,<ref name=sb9/> although Rigel C cannot be detected in the spectrum which is inconsistent with its observed brightness.<ref name=sanford/>\n\nIn 1878, Burnham found another possibly associated star of approximately 13th magnitude. He listed it as component D of \u03b2&nbsp;555,<ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> although it is unclear whether it is physically related or a coincidental alignment.  Its 2017 separation from Rigel was {{val|44.5|ul=\"}} almost due north at a position angle of 1\u00b0.<ref name=WDS/>  Gaia DR2 finds it to be a 12th magnitude sunlike star<!-- Does \"orange dwarf\" count as \"sunlike\"? --> at approximately the same distance as Rigel.<ref name=dr2d/> Likely a [[K-type main-sequence star]], this star would have an orbital period of around 250,000 years, if it is part of the Rigel system.<ref name=\"kalerrigel\"/> A spectroscopic companion to Rigel was reported on the basis of radial velocity variations, and its orbit was even calculated, but subsequent work suggests that the star does not exist and that observed pulsations are intrinsic to Rigel itself.<ref name=sb9/>\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n[[File:Hertzsprung-Russel StarData.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=A chart showing several labelled stars against shaded coloured areas with axes of spectral type and absolute magnitude|Rigel's place at top-center on the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]]]]\nRigel is a [[blue supergiant]] that has exhausted the hydrogen fuel in its core, expanded and cooled as it moved away from the [[main sequence]] across the upper part of the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]].<ref name=guinan/><ref name=seeds/> When it was on the main sequence, its [[effective temperature]] would have been around {{val|30,000|fmt=commas|ul=K}}.<ref name=saio/> Rigel's complex variability at [[Electromagnetic spectrum|visual wavelengths]] is caused by [[stellar pulsations]] similar to those of [[Deneb]]. Additional observations of radial velocity variations indicate that it simultaneously oscillates in at least 19 non-radial modes with periods ranging from about 1.2 to 74 days.<ref name=apj2012_747_108/>\n\nEstimation of many physical characteristics of blue supergiant stars, including Rigel, is challenging due to their rarity and uncertainty about how far they are from the Sun. As such, their characteristics are mainly estimated from theoretical [[Stellar evolution#Models|stellar evolution models]].<ref name=demarque2008/>  However, its effective temperature can be determined from the spectral type and colour to be around {{val|12,100|fmt=commas|ul=K}}.<ref name=przybilla/> A mass of {{val|21|3|u=solar mass}} at an age of {{val|8|1}} million years has been determined by comparing evolutionary tracks, while atmospheric modelling from the spectrum gives a mass of {{solar mass|{{val|24|8}}}}.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/>\n\nAlthough Rigel is often considered the most luminous star within 1,000 light-years of the Sun,<ref name=\"schaaf\" /><ref name=burnham/> its energy output is poorly known. Using the Hipparcos distance of {{convert|264|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}, the estimated relative luminosity for Rigel is about 120,000 times that of the Sun ({{solar luminosity|link=y}}),<ref name=apj2012_747_108/> but another recently published distance of {{convert|360|\u00b1|40|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} suggests an even higher luminosity of {{solar luminosity|219,000}}.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/> Other calculations based on theoretical stellar evolutionary models of Rigel's atmosphere give luminosities anywhere between {{solar luminosity|83,000}} and {{solar luminosity|363,000}},<ref name=markova/> while summing the [[spectral energy distribution]] from historical photometry with the Hipparcos distance suggests a luminosity as low as {{val|61515|11486|u={{solar luminosity}}|fmt=commas}}.<ref name=baines/> A 2018 study using the [[Navy Precision Optical Interferometer]] measured the [[angular diameter]] as {{val|2.526|u=mas}}. After correcting for [[limb darkening]], the angular diameter is found to be {{val|2.606|0.009|u=mas}}, yielding a radius of {{solar radius|{{val|74.1|+6.1|-7.3}}|link=y}}.<ref name=baines/> An older measurement of the angular diameter gives {{val|2.75|0.01|u=mas}},<ref name=auf/> equivalent to a radius {{solar radius|78.9}} at {{val|264|u=pc}}.<ref name=apj2012_747_108/>  These radii are calculated assuming the Hipparcos distance of {{val|264|u=pc}}; adopting a distance of {{val|360|u=pc}} leads to a significantly larger size.<ref name=chesneau2014/>\n\nDue to their closeness to each other and ambiguity of the spectrum, little is known about the individual intrinsic properties of the members of the Rigel BC triple system. All three stars seem to be near equally hot [[B-type main-sequence star]]s that are 3 to 4 times as massive as the Sun.<ref name=msc/>\n\n== Evolution ==\n[[Stellar evolution]] models suggest that the pulsations of Rigel are powered by nuclear reactions in a hydrogen-burning shell that is at least partially non-convective. These pulsations are stronger and more numerous in stars that have evolved through a [[red supergiant]] phase and then increased in temperature to again become a blue supergiant.  This is due to the decreased mass and increased levels of fusion products at the surface of the star.<ref name=saio/>\n\nRigel is likely to be [[Triple-alpha process|fusing helium]] in its core.<ref name=apj2012_749_74 /> Due to strong convection of helium produced in the core while Rigel was on the main sequence and in the hydrogen-burning shell since it became a supergiant, the fraction of helium at the surface has increased from 26.6% when the star formed to 32% now.  The surface abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen seen in the spectrum are compatible with a post-red supergiant star only if its internal convection zones are modelled using non-homogeneous chemical conditions known as the [[Paul_Ledoux#Ledoux_criterion|Ledoux Criteria]].<ref name=saio/>\n\nRigel is expected to eventually end its stellar life as a type II [[supernova]].<ref name=apj2012_749_74/> It is one of the closest known potential supernova progenitors to Earth,<ref name=apj2012_747_108/> and would be expected to have a maximum apparent magnitude of around {{val|-11}} (about the same brightness as a quarter Moon or around 300 times brighter than Venus ever gets.)<ref name=guinan/>\n\n==Etymology and cultural significance==\nThe earliest known recording of the modern name ''Rigel'' is in the ''[[Alfonsine tables]]'' of 1521. It is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name ''{{transl|ar|Rijl Jauzah al Yusr\u0101}}'', \"the left leg (foot) of Jauzah\" (i.e. ''rijl'' meaning \"leg, foot\"),<ref name=allen/> which can be traced to the 10th century.<ref name=\"KUNITZSCH1959\"/> \"Jauzah\" was a proper name for Orion; an alternative Arabic name was {{lang|ar|\u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0628\u0627\u0631}} ''{{transl|ar|rijl al-jabb\u0101r}}'', \"the foot of the great one\", from which stems the rarely used variant names ''Algebar'' or ''Elgebar''. The ''Alphonsine tables'' saw its name split into \"Rigel\" and \"Algebar\", with the note, ''et dicitur Algebar. Nominatur etiam Rigel.''<ref name=Kunitzsch86/> Alternate spellings from the 17th century include ''Regel'' by Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]], ''Riglon'' by German astronomer [[Wilhelm Schickard]], and ''Rigel Algeuze'' or ''Algibbar'' by English scholar [[Edmund Chilmead]].<ref name=\"allen\"/>\n\nWith the constellation representing the mythological Greek huntsman [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], Rigel is his knee or (as its name suggests) foot; with the nearby star [[Beta Eridani]] marking Orion's footstool.<ref name=\"schaaf\"/> Rigel is presumably the star known as \"[[Aurvandil]]'s toe\" in [[Norse mythology]].<ref name=cleasby/> In the Caribbean, Rigel represented the severed leg of the folkloric figure ''Trois Rois'', himself represented by the three stars of Orion's Belt.
