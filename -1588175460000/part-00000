These did not involve any special devices beyond the apparatus used for burning or heating to produce fumes. Early inhalation devices included one devised by John Mudge in 1778. It had a pewter mug with a hole allowing attachment of a flexible tube. Mudge used it for the treatment of coughs using opium. These devices evolved with modifications by Wolfe, Mackenzie (1872) and better mouth attachments such as by Beigel in 1866. Many of these early inhalers needed heat to vapourize the active chemical ingredient. The benefits of forced expiration and inspiration to treat asthma were noted by J. S. Monell in 1865. Chemicals used in inhalers included ammonia, chlorine, iodine, tar, balsams, turpentine camphor and numerous others in combinations.<ref>{{cite book| title=Inhalation in the treatment of disease: its therapeutics and practice| author=Cohen, J.

The 15&nbsp;milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly [[Amnesia|amnesic]] to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/>\n\nThe Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in [[Obstetrics|obstetric]] patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with [[bone fracture]]s and [[joint dislocation]]s,<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> and for dressing changes on [[burn]] patients.<ref name=Packer1969/> When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent [[adverse effect]] on [[Apgar score]]s.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> All [[vital signs]] remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and [[sedation]] until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the [[patient-controlled analgesia]] [[infusion pump]]s of today.<ref name=Major1966/><ref name=Dragon1967/><ref name=Firn1972/><ref name=Josephson1974/> The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the [[Penthrox inhaler]].<ref name=Babl2007/><ref name=Grindlay2009/><ref name=Babl2006/><ref name=McLennan2007/><ref name=Penthrox2009/><ref name=RADAR2010/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of medical inhalants]]\n* [[Decongestant]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Babl2006>{{cite journal|vauthors=Babl FE, Jamison SR, Spicer M, Bernard S |title=Inhaled methoxyflurane as a prehospital analgesic in children (subscription required)|journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia|volume=18|issue=4|pages=404\u201310|year=2006|doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2006.00874.x|pmid=16842312}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Babl2007>{{cite journal|vauthors=Babl F, Barnett P, Palmer G, Oakley E, Davidson A |title=A pilot study of inhaled methoxyflurane for procedural analgesia in children (subscription required)|journal=Pediatric Anesthesia|volume=17|issue=2|pages=148\u201353|year=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9592.2006.02037.x|pmid=17238886}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Dragon1967>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dragon A, Goldstein I |title=Methoxyflurane: preliminary report on analgesic and mood modifying properties in dentistry (subscription required)|journal=Journal of the American Dental Association|volume=75|issue=5|pages=1176\u201381|year=1967|doi=10.14219/jada.archive.1967.0358|pmid=5233333}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Firn1972>{{cite journal|author=Firn S|title=Methoxyflurane analgesia for burns dressings and other painful ward procedures in children (subscription required)|journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia|volume=44|issue=5|pages=517\u201322|year=1972|doi=10.1093/bja/44.5.517|pmid=5044082}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Grindlay2009>{{cite journal|vauthors=Grindlay J, Babl FE |title=Efficacy and safety of methoxyflurane analgesia in the emergency department and prehospital setting|journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia|volume=21|issue=1|pages=4\u201311|year=2009|pmid=19254307|doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2009.01153.x}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Josephson1974>{{cite journal|vauthors=Josephson CA, Schwartz W |title=The Cardiff Inhaler and Penthrane.

These did not involve any special devices beyond the apparatus used for burning or heating to produce fumes. Early inhalation devices included one devised by John Mudge in 1778. It had a pewter mug with a hole allowing attachment of a flexible tube. Mudge used it for the treatment of coughs using opium. These devices evolved with modifications by Wolfe, Mackenzie (1872) and better mouth attachments such as by Beigel in 1866. Many of these early inhalers needed heat to vapourize the active chemical ingredient. The benefits of forced expiration and inspiration to treat asthma were noted by J. S. Monell in 1865. Chemicals used in inhalers included ammonia, chlorine, iodine, tar, balsams, turpentine camphor and numerous others in combinations.<ref>{{cite book| title=Inhalation in the treatment of disease: its therapeutics and practice| author=Cohen, J.

The device contained a rolled [[Candle wick|wick]] of [[polypropylene]] [[felt]] which held 15&nbsp;[[Litre#SI prefixes applied to the litre|milliliters]] of methoxyflurane.\n\nBecause of the simplicity of the Analgizer and the [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of [[Procedural sedation and analgesia|conscious analgesia]] which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary over a period of time lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15&nbsp;milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly [[Amnesia|amnesic]] to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/>\n\nThe Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in [[Obstetrics|obstetric]] patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with [[bone fracture]]s and [[joint dislocation]]s,<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> and for dressing changes on [[burn]] patients.<ref name=Packer1969/> When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent [[adverse effect]] on [[Apgar score]]s.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> All [[vital signs]] remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and [[sedation]] until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the [[patient-controlled analgesia]] [[infusion pump]]s of today.<ref name=Major1966/><ref name=Dragon1967/><ref name=Firn1972/><ref name=Josephson1974/> The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the [[Penthrox inhaler]].<ref name=Babl2007/><ref name=Grindlay2009/><ref name=Babl2006/><ref name=McLennan2007/><ref name=Penthrox2009/><ref name=RADAR2010/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of medical inhalants]]\n* [[Decongestant]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Babl2006>{{cite journal|vauthors=Babl FE, Jamison SR, Spicer M, Bernard S |title=Inhaled methoxyflurane as a prehospital analgesic in children (subscription required)|journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia|volume=18|issue=4|pages=404\u201310|year=2006|doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2006.00874.x|pmid=16842312}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Babl2007>{{cite journal|vauthors=Babl F, Barnett P, Palmer G, Oakley E, Davidson A |title=A pilot study of inhaled methoxyflurane for procedural analgesia in children (subscription required)|journal=Pediatric Anesthesia|volume=17|issue=2|pages=148\u201353|year=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9592.2006.02037.x|pmid=17238886}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Dragon1967>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dragon A, Goldstein I |title=Methoxyflurane: preliminary report on analgesic and mood modifying properties in dentistry (subscription required)|journal=Journal of the American Dental Association|volume=75|issue=5|pages=1176\u201381|year=1967|doi=10.14219/jada.archive.1967.0358|pmid=5233333}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Firn1972>{{cite journal|author=Firn S|title=Methoxyflurane analgesia for burns dressings and other painful ward procedures in children (subscription required)|journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia|volume=44|issue=5|pages=517\u201322|year=1972|doi=10.1093/bja/44.5.517|pmid=5044082}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Grindlay2009>{{cite journal|vauthors=Grindlay J, Babl FE |title=Efficacy and safety of methoxyflurane analgesia in the emergency department and prehospital setting|journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia|volume=21|issue=1|pages=4\u201311|year=2009|pmid=19254307|doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2009.01153.x}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Josephson1974>{{cite journal|vauthors=Josephson CA, Schwartz W |title=The Cardiff Inhaler and Penthrane.

With this extra time to work on these and future episodes while taking in reception from this season, I think the next will really benefit in the long term. Plus, it gets the rare honor of being a new Fox animated show that actually GOT a second season, which has not happened since ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' got its first renewal at the start of the decade. Fox is thinking outside the box to keep its adult animation thriving, which hopefully means more chances for exploration in future seasons. I\u2019ll tell you what, these Harts are quite blessed to be given the chance to be Fox\u2019s next enduring animated series.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bubbleblabber.com/season-review-bless-the-harts-season-one/|title=Season Review: 'Bless the Harts' Season 1|last=Kaldor|first=David|accessdate=April 18, 2020|date=January 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Parents Television Council]], a frequent critic of [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] animated comedies like ''[[Family Guy]]'', gave the first episode a negative review, citing \"This tells potential viewers everything they need to know about the show...except for the tasteless appearances of a beer-swilling Jesus who appears in person to mock Jenny at her restaurant, the Last Supper. In the past, Fox has been the TV capital of adult animation. ''[[The Simpsons]]'' is a mainstay of television (indeed, now holds the record for the longest-running prime-time series in TV history); ''Bob\u2019s Burgers'' is consistently amusing; and even ''Family Guy'', repugnant though it is, manages a clever joke or one-liner once in a blue moon. But ''Bless The Harts'' is just plain lazy. It is clear the show\u2019s creators believe that tired \u201cSouthern redneck\u201d cliches ripped off from ''King of the Hill'', plentiful profanity, and a little of the absurdity of the late, unlamented ''Son of Zorn'' (which, not coincidentally, was produced by the same team as ''Bless The Harts'') are sufficient to entertain audiences, with any effort in the way of genuine characterization or comedy being superfluous. Judging by the first episode, this entire program is a waste of time. The artwork is shoddy, the cutaways nonsensical, and the script is totally lacking in humor. And while the program does boast voiceover talent by the likes of Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph, such talent is utterly wasted when the characters are given nothing funny to say. Using talented voice artists on this dreck is like putting a silk bow on a cowpie.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parentstv.org/blog/bless-the-harts-because-no-one-else-will|title='Bless the Harts'

With this extra time to work on these and future episodes while taking in reception from this season, I think the next will really benefit in the long term. Plus, it gets the rare honor of being a new Fox animated show that actually GOT a second season, which has not happened since ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' got its first renewal at the start of the decade. Fox is thinking outside the box to keep its adult animation thriving, which hopefully means more chances for exploration in future seasons. I\u2019ll tell you what, these Harts are quite blessed to be given the chance to be Fox\u2019s next enduring animated series.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bubbleblabber.com/season-review-bless-the-harts-season-one/|title=Season Review: 'Bless the Harts' Season 1|last=Kaldor|first=David|accessdate=April 18, 2020|date=January 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Parents Television Council]], a frequent critic of [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] animated comedies like ''[[Family Guy]]'', gave the first episode a negative review, citing \"This tells potential viewers everything they need to know about the show...except for the tasteless appearances of a beer-swilling Jesus who appears in person to mock Jenny at her restaurant, the Last Supper. In the past, Fox has been the TV capital of adult animation. ''[[The Simpsons]]'' is a mainstay of television (indeed, now holds the record for the longest-running prime-time series in TV history); ''Bob\u2019s Burgers'' is consistently amusing; and even ''Family Guy'', repugnant though it is, manages a clever joke or one-liner once in a blue moon. But ''Bless The Harts'' is just plain lazy. It is clear the show\u2019s creators believe that tired \u201cSouthern redneck\u201d cliches ripped off from ''King of the Hill'', plentiful profanity, and a little of the absurdity of the late, unlamented ''Son of Zorn'' (which, not coincidentally, was produced by the same team as ''Bless The Harts'') are sufficient to entertain audiences, with any effort in the way of genuine characterization or comedy being superfluous. Judging by the first episode, this entire program is a waste of time. The artwork is shoddy, the cutaways nonsensical, and the script is totally lacking in humor. And while the program does boast voiceover talent by the likes of Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph, such talent is utterly wasted when the characters are given nothing funny to say. Using talented voice artists on this dreck is like putting a silk bow on a cowpie.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parentstv.org/blog/bless-the-harts-because-no-one-else-will|title='Bless the Harts'
