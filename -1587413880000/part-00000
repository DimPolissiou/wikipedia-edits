They are analogous to the [[Interstate Highway System]] in the [[United States]] or the [[Autoroutes of Quebec|Autoroute system]] of neighbouring [[Quebec]], and are regulated by the [[Ministry of Transportation of Ontario]] (MTO). The 400-series designations were introduced in 1952, although Ontario had been constructing divided highways for two decades prior. Initially, only Highways&nbsp;400, 401 and 402 were numbered; other designations followed in the subsequent decades.\n\nModern 400-series highways have high design standards, [[speed limit]]s of {{convert|100|km/h|mph}} (a 110&nbsp;km/h trial is taking place on select stretches), and various collision avoidance and traffic management systems. The design of 400-series highways has set the precedent for a number of innovations used throughout [[North America]], including the [[parclo interchange]] and a modified [[Jersey barrier]] design known as the Ontario Tall Wall. As a result, they currently experience the lowest accident and fatality rate comparative to traffic volume in North America.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== History ==\nWhen the 400-series designations were first applied to Ontario freeways in 1952,<ref name=\"series400\">{{cite news\n |title       = Search Engine: Highway Mysteries Solved\n |first       = Karena\n |last        = Walter\n |work        = The Niagara Falls Review\n |date        = February 21, 2014\n |url         = http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2014/02/21/search-engine-highway-mysteries-solved\n |accessdate  = December 17, 2015\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222082645/http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2014/02/21/search-engine-highway-mysteries-solved\n |archivedate = December 22, 2015\n}}</ref>\nseveral divided highways had already been opened in Southern Ontario.<ref name=\"1953map\">{{cite map\n\n | title       = Ontario Road Map\n | first = C.P. |last= Robins\n | publisher   = Ontario Department of Highways\n | year        = 1952\n | section     = Q28\u2013U41}}</ref>\nOriginally inspired by German [[Autobahn]]s, Minister of Highways [[Thomas McQuesten]] planned a network of \"Dual Highways\" across the southern half of the province during the 1930s.<ref>{{cite news\n\n | title      = Hopes to Improve Roads\n | work       = The Gazette\n | location   = Montreal\n | date       = February 18, 1936\n | page       = 14\n | url        = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b74tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xpgFAAAAIBAJ&dq=mcqueston%20highway&pg=3117%2C2124256\n | accessdate = February 9, 2010}}</ref>{{sfnp|Stamp|1987|pp=11\u201312|ps=.}}\nThe [[Queen Elizabeth Way]] (QEW) was first, an upgrade to the partially constructed [[The Middle Road|Middle Road]] in 1934.<ref name=\"globeandmail\">{{cite news\n\n | title      = Remember That 'Little Four-Lane Freeway?'\n | last       = English\n | first      = Bob\n | work       = The Globe And Mail\n | location   = Toronto\n | date       = March 16, 2006\n | quote      = ...the freeway concept was promoted by Hamiltonian Thomas B.

highways''' are a network of [[controlled-access highway]]s throughout the [[Southern Ontario|southern portion]] of the Canadian province of [[Ontario]], forming a special subset of the [[Highways in Ontario|provincial highway system]]. They are analogous to the [[Interstate Highway System]] in the [[United States]] or the [[Autoroutes of Quebec|Autoroute system]] of neighbouring [[Quebec]], and are regulated by the [[Ministry of Transportation of Ontario]] (MTO). The 400-series designations were introduced in 1952, although Ontario had been constructing divided highways for two decades prior. Initially, only Highways&nbsp;400, 401 and 402 were numbered; other designations followed in the subsequent decades.\n\nModern 400-series highways have high design standards, [[speed limit]]s of {{convert|100|km/h|mph}} (a 110km/h trial is taking place on select stretches), and various collision avoidance and traffic management systems. The design of 400-series highways has set the precedent for a number of innovations used throughout [[North America]], including the [[parclo interchange]] and a modified [[Jersey barrier]] design known as the Ontario Tall Wall. As a result, they currently experience the lowest accident and fatality rate comparative to traffic volume in North America.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== History ==\nWhen the 400-series designations were first applied to Ontario freeways in 1952,<ref name=\"series400\">{{cite news\n |title       = Search Engine: Highway Mysteries Solved\n |first       = Karena\n |last        = Walter\n |work        = The Niagara Falls Review\n |date        = February 21, 2014\n |url         = http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2014/02/21/search-engine-highway-mysteries-solved\n |accessdate  = December 17, 2015\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222082645/http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2014/02/21/search-engine-highway-mysteries-solved\n |archivedate = December 22, 2015\n}}</ref>\nseveral divided highways had already been opened in Southern Ontario.<ref name=\"1953map\">{{cite map\n\n | title       = Ontario Road Map\n | first = C.P. |last= Robins\n | publisher   = Ontario Department of Highways\n | year        = 1952\n | section     = Q28\u2013U41}}</ref>\nOriginally inspired by German [[Autobahn]]s, Minister of Highways [[Thomas McQuesten]] planned a network of \"Dual Highways\" across the southern half of the province during the 1930s.<ref>{{cite news\n\n | title      = Hopes to Improve Roads\n | work       = The Gazette\n | location   = Montreal\n | date       = February 18, 1936\n | page       = 14\n | url        = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b74tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xpgFAAAAIBAJ&dq=mcqueston%20highway&pg=3117%2C2124256\n | accessdate = February 9, 2010}}</ref>{{sfnp|Stamp|1987|pp=11\u201312|ps=.}}\nThe [[Queen Elizabeth Way]] (QEW) was first, an upgrade to the partially constructed [[The Middle Road|Middle Road]] in 1934.<ref name=\"globeandmail\">{{cite news\n\n | title      = Remember That 'Little Four-Lane Freeway?'\n | last       = English\n | first      = Bob\n | work       = The Globe And Mail\n | location   = Toronto\n | date       = March 16, 2006\n | quote      = ...the freeway concept was promoted by Hamiltonian Thomas B.

To promote economic development in a disadvantaged region (e.g., the current extension of Highway 400 to [[Northern Ontario]]), a 400-series highway may be built where the existing highway's traffic counts fall below 10,000.<ref>{{cite report\n | title       = Highway 69 Action Plan\n | author       = Ministry of Northern Development and Mines\n | publisher       = Government of Ontario\n | date       = June 2005\n | page       = 3\n | url       = http://www.thepixelwarehouse.com/69_2006/pdf/2005_HWY69_ActionPlan_e.pdf\n | accessdate       = February 25, 2016\n | format       = PDF\n | url-status       = dead\n | archiveurl       = https://web.archive.org/web/20140309201327/http://www.thepixelwarehouse.com/69_2006/pdf/2005_HWY69_ActionPlan_e.pdf\n | archivedate       = March 9, 2014\n }}</ref>\n\nThe MTO plans and finances the construction and maintenance of the King's Highway system, which includes the 400-series network.<ref>{{cite web\n\n | title      = Highway Traffic Act\n | publisher  = Government of Ontario\n | year       = 2016\n | url        = https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90h08\n | accessdate = May 8, 2016}}</ref>\nThe system includes {{convert|1971.8|km}} of freeways.

This led to the test trial of three HOV lanes in the GTA in December 2005: southbound Highway&nbsp;404 between Highway&nbsp;7 and Highway&nbsp;401, with a dedicated HOV ramp built to connect with westbound Highway&nbsp;401, and Highway&nbsp;403 in both directions between Highway&nbsp;407 and Highway&nbsp;401 in Mississauga.<ref>{{cite report\n\n | title      = Evaluating HOV Plans and Priorities \u2013 the Case of Expressways in the GTA\n | first1     = Goran\n | last1      = Nikolic\n | first2     = Rob\n | last2      = Pringle\n | publisher  = Transportation Association of Canada\n | year       = 2008\n | pages      = 2\u20134\n | url        = http://conf.tac-atc.ca/english/resourcecentre/readingroom/conference/conf2008/docs/k2/Pringle.pdf\n | accessdate = January 1, 2016\n | format     = PDF}}</ref>\nSince then, HOV lanes have been opened on several 400-series freeways around the [[Golden Horseshoe]] and [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]].

It was raised in 1901 from [[Second Boer War]] veterans of the [[Imperial Yeomanry]]. During the [[First World War]] it served dismounted at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], was remounted to serve in [[Macedonian front|Macedonia]], [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Egypt and Palestine]], before being converted to machine gunners for service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. 2nd and 3rd Line units remained in the [[United Kingdom]] throughout.\n\nBetween the wars, it was converted to an [[Armored car (military)|Armoured Car]] Company before being expanded back to regimental size and forming a duplicate regiment, the '''4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)'''. Both regiments served throughout the [[North African Campaign]] (notably at [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]]), before moving on to [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]] (3rd CLY) and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]]. Both regiments returned to the United Kingdom in time to prepare for the opening of the [[Western Front (World War II)|Second Front]].\n\nDue to losses, and a shortage of replacement personnel and equipment, the regiments were amalgamated in August 1944 as '''3rd/4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)'''. The regiment went on to serve throughout the North-West Europe Campaign, ending the war in Germany.\n\nPost-war, 3rd/4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) reformed as a [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] armoured regiment in 1947. In 1961 the regiment merged with the [[Kent Yeomanry]] to form the [[Kent and Sharpshooters Yeomanry]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early history===\nOn 13 December 1899, the decision to allow volunteer forces serve in the [[Second Boer War]] was made. Due to the string of defeats during [[Black Week]] in December 1899, the British government realized they were going to need more troops than just the regular army, thus issuing a [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]] on 24 December 1899. This warrant officially created the [[Imperial Yeomanry]].<ref name=angloboerwar>{{cite web | url=http://www.angloboerwar.com/unit-information/imperial-yeomanry/1946-imperial-yeomanry?showall=1&limitstart= | title=Imperial Yeomanry | publisher=www.angloboerwar.com | accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 18th, 21st, 23rd and 25th Battalions were raised in early 1900 and designated as \"Sharpshooters\".<ref name=MillsIY>{{cite web|url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/cav/ImpYeo.htm |title=Imperial Yeomanry at regiments.org by T.F.Mills |accessdate=2007-05-29 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529010837/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/cav/ImpYeo.htm |archivedate=29 May 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> Unlike most battalions, which were formed from the existing [[Yeomanry]] regiments providing service companies of approximately 115 men each,<ref name=ROH>{{cite web | url = http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Regiments/BoerWarNotes.html | title = Boer War Notes | publisher=www.roll-of-honour.com | accessdate = 28 March 2014 }}</ref> the Sharpshooters were selected from volunteers who could prove their skill with a rifle and their horsemanship.<ref name=Mileham98>{{harvnb|Mileham|1994|p=98}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 July 1901, the '''3rd County of London Imperial Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)''' was formed from South African War veterans to perpetuate the 18th, 21st and 23rd Battalions, Imperial Yeomanry.

Army]]. It was raised in 1901 from [[Second Boer War]] veterans of the [[Imperial Yeomanry]]. During the [[First World War]] it served dismounted at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], was remounted to serve in [[Macedonian front|Macedonia]], [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Egypt and Palestine]], before being converted to machine gunners for service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. 2nd and 3rd Line units remained in the [[United Kingdom]] throughout.\n\nBetween the wars, it was converted to an [[Armored car (military)|Armoured Car]] Company before being expanded back to regimental size and forming a duplicate regiment, the '''4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)'''. Both regiments served throughout the [[North African Campaign]] (notably at [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]]), before moving on to [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]] (3rd CLY) and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]]. Both regiments returned to the United Kingdom in time to prepare for the opening of the [[Western Front (World War II)|Second Front]].\n\nDue to losses, and a shortage of replacement personnel and equipment, the regiments were amalgamated in August 1944 as '''3rd/4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)'''. The regiment went on to serve throughout the North-West Europe Campaign, ending the war in Germany.\n\nPost-war, 3rd/4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) reformed as a [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] armoured regiment in 1947. In 1961 the regiment merged with the [[Kent Yeomanry]] to form the [[Kent and Sharpshooters Yeomanry]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early history===\nOn 13 December 1899, the decision to allow volunteer forces serve in the [[Second Boer War]] was made. Due to the string of defeats during [[Black Week]] in December 1899, the British government realized they were going to need more troops than just the regular army, thus issuing a [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]] on 24 December 1899. This warrant officially created the [[Imperial Yeomanry]].<ref name=angloboerwar>{{cite web | url=http://www.angloboerwar.com/unit-information/imperial-yeomanry/1946-imperial-yeomanry?showall=1&limitstart= | title=Imperial Yeomanry | publisher=www.angloboerwar.com | accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 18th, 21st, 23rd and 25th Battalions were raised in early 1900 and designated as \"Sharpshooters\".<ref name=MillsIY>{{cite web|url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/cav/ImpYeo.htm |title=Imperial Yeomanry at regiments.org by T.F.Mills |accessdate=2007-05-29 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529010837/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/cav/ImpYeo.htm |archivedate=29 May 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> Unlike most battalions, which were formed from the existing [[Yeomanry]] regiments providing service companies of approximately 115 men each,<ref name=ROH>{{cite web | url = http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Regiments/BoerWarNotes.html | title = Boer War Notes | publisher=www.roll-of-honour.com | accessdate = 28 March 2014 }}</ref> the Sharpshooters were selected from volunteers who could prove their skill with a rifle and their horsemanship.<ref name=Mileham98>{{harvnb|Mileham|1994|p=98}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 July 1901, the '''3rd County of London Imperial Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)''' was formed from South African War veterans to perpetuate the 18th, 21st and 23rd Battalions, Imperial Yeomanry.

A five-time [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard Magazine Award]]- winner, she is known for hosting the #1 on-air position in the New York radio market as the mid-day host of [[106.7 Lite FM|106.7 LITE FM]]. Smaldone is a [[PBS]] host and interviewer for [[WNET]], [[WLIW]], [[NJTV]], and other public television stations, and is a featured reporter on [[ABC Studios|ABC]] for the [[Columbus Day Parade]]. She is currently the host, producer and founder of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and food-themed talk radio program and podcast \u201cBagels and Broadway with Valerie Smaldone.\u201d\n\nAn accomplished voice-over artist, Valerie was the narrator on the episodic program \u201cFatal Encounters\u201d on [[Investigation Discovery|Investigation Discovery Channel]]. She has recorded commercials for clients like [[Verizon]], [[Victoria's Secret]] and [[Vanguard]] as well as television promos for The [[CBS]] [[The Morning Show (American TV series)|Morning Show]], [[Dateline NBC|Dateline]] on [[NBC]], [[NBC Nightly News|The NBC Nightly News]], [[The TODAY Show|The Today Show]], [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]], [[Cinemax]] and many others. Valerie was the announcer for The Boomer Esiason Show on [[MSG Network|MSG]] for 4 seasons. A career spanning over four decades, Smaldone has a successful career in radio, television, theatre, and film.\n\n==Early life==\nSmaldone was born in the Bronx in New York City. Born to parents Frances Carcaterra Smaldone and Anthony Smaldone. She attended the Bronx High School of Science but described herself as \u201ccompletely obsessed\u201d with theatre at an early age.\n\nIn the mid-70s, she attended [[Fordham University]] in the Bronx studying Communications and English.\n\nDespite living in the Bronx, Smaldone found herself unaffected by the borough's dire situation, \u201cI didn\u2019t really know any better. It was what it was. I lived on campus for two of my four years, so that felt quite safe.\u201d\n\nWithin her first days on campus, she stopped by Fordham's radio station, [[WFUV]]. Smaldone enjoyed her time working at WFUV, which was not yet a public radio station but an exclusively student-run organization. One of her favorite memories at WFUV, where she hosted her own Broadway show tunes program called \u201cShowstoppers,\u201d was the opportunity to interview composer [[Charles Strouse]]. Strouse, made a drawing for Smaldone that she still keeps.\n\n==Career==\n===Radio===\nDuring her Fordham years, Smaldone interned for [[Universal Pictures]] at its New York public relations office. She was then offered two jobs: one working in PR at a summertime music festival sponsored by [[PepsiCo]] and another at Hartsdale-based radio station [[WFAS (AM)|WFAS]], owned by Frank A. Seitz. She sent a demo tape of her work at [[WFUV]] to WFAS, and, at first, was not hired. However, a second demo reel landed Smaldone her first radio job during her junior year at Fordham.\n\nAfter graduation in 1979, Smaldone began working at WWYD, an FM station owned by the same company as WFAS. By 1981, Smaldone was recruited by WVIP in Mt. Kisco, New York. Owned by producer Martin Stone, Stone hired Smaldone to host an afternoon show as well as a morning program on Sundays. Smaldone then began hosting and producing a cable television program called, \u201cMeet the VIPs.\u201d This program granted her more interviewing experience with guests like television icon [[Regis Philbin]] and [[Rachel Robinson|Mrs. Jackie Robinson]].\n\nAfter meeting her, Bob Bruno, the program director of WOR, suggested she send a demo tape to George Wolfson, General Manager of the soon-to-be new adult contemporary radio station, WLTW (Lite-FM).\n\nShe was quickly snapped up and hosted her first on-air shift at the newly formed radio station, [[WLTW]], 1067. LITE-FM, on Feb. 4, 1984. She went on to be the evening host for 5 years. By 1989, the station created a noon to 4 p.m. midday slot and gave Smaldone mid-day hosting responsibilities, which she did for 19 years. \u201cWe were the Yankees of radio,\u201d she claimed.\n\nIn addition to radio, Smaldone recorded daily local news promos on [[CBS-TV]], and was paid $700 a day for hosting the television shopping show \u201cShopper\u2019s University.\u201d She was also offered a weekend job as a QVC host in West Chester, PA, but she took the Shopper's University offer instead. Smaldone hosted and produced \u201ctwo or three syndicated shows\u201d for which she conducted a variety of interviews with celebrities like [[Paul McCartney]], [[Elton John]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[Cher]], [[the Bee Gees]], and [[Mariah Carey]].\n\nAmong the many interviews she has conducted, her interview with [[Rod Stewart]] led to a friendship, as Mr. Stewart took notice of Smaldone's talent. Shortly after their second successful interview, Mr. Stewart personally requested Smaldone to interview him for his 2003 concert special, \u201c[[It Had to Be You: The Great American Songbook]].\u201d\n\nAfter 24 years at WLTW and many notable ventures, including co-presenting the [[Billboard Music Award|2000 Billboard Music Awards]] with [[Ryan Seacrest]], and the [[1996 Summer Olympics torch relay|1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic]] Torch event in Rockefeller Center with [[Bob Costas]], Smaldone felt it was time for a change.
