Athlone developed due to its military significance, and its strategic location on the main Dublin\u2013Galway route across the [[River Shannon]]. Mullingar gained considerable advantage from the development of the [[Royal Canal]]. The canal facilitated cheap transport of produce to Dublin, Britain and Europe. Athlone and Mullingar expanded further with the coming of the [[Midland Great Western Railway]] network in the nineteenth century.\n\nTourism in Westmeath is generally based on its many water amenities. The county lakes include [[Lough Derravaragh]], [[Lough Ennell]], [[Lough Owel]], [[Lough Lene]], [[Lough Sheelin]] and [[Lough Ree]]. Both the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]], and the Royal Canal flow through Westmeath, and the [[River Shannon]] (Ireland's key tourism waterway) has a modern inland harbour in Athlone.\n\nIn 2017 the largest employment sectors within Westmeath were:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibec.ie/IBEC/Press/PressPublicationsdoclib3.nsf/vPages/Newsroom%7Eibec-highlights-need-to-address-infrastructure-imbalance-15-02-2017/$file/Local+Economic+Indicators+2017.pdf |title=Eibic highlights |date=2017 |website=www.ibec.ie |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Athone - Mullingar section of the Dublin \u2013 Galway Greenway, along the old railway corridor between Athlone and Mullingar, was constructed in 2015. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.westmeathcoco.ie/en/ourservices/tourismartsrecreation/greenway/|title=Westmeath County Council - Westmeath Royal Canal Greenway<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=westmeathcoco.ie|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\nThe Royal Canal Greenway takes tourists from the county boundary to Mullingar, and then on towards Longford. Those wishing to use the Dublin-Galway Greenway can transfer from the Royal Canal route to the old rail corridor onwards towards Athlone.\n\nThe development of industry in Westmeath has been mainly based on food processing and consumer products. Whiskey is distilled in Kilbeggan and tobacco is processed in Mullingar. The county has an extensive beef and dairy trade. In recent times, the manufacturer [[Alkermes (company)|Alkermes]] has located in Athlone. The eastern part of the county is home to commuters, many of whom work at the technology parks on the western side of [[Dublin]].\n\nMullingar is renowned for the high quality of its beef and veal. Weaned cattle from the west of the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] are fattened for market on the lush [[grassland]]s of Meath and Westmeath. The cattle are also used to maintain grassland to help sustain wildlife in the areas fringing the [[Bog of Allen]].\n\nWestmeath is home to many stud farms. The plains of Westmeath, covered in calcium-rich [[marl]], contribute significantly to calcification of foal bones during their formative years. Westmeath mares are usually put into foal in spring to facilitate summer growth. Pregnancy lasts for approximately 335\u2013340 days and usually results in one foal. Horses mature when they are around four years old.\n\n==Railways==\nWestmeath also has railway infrastructure with a number of trains passing through towns in the county. The [[Dublin\u2013Westport/Galway railway line]] runs through the county, with services from [[Dublin Heuston]] to [[Galway railway station|Galway]]/[[Westport railway station, Mayo|Westport]]/[[Ballina railway station|Ballina]] inter-city train service stops at [[Athlone railway station|Athlone]], while the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line]] service stops at [[Mullingar railway station|Mullingar]].  The line from [[Athlone railway station|Athlone]] via [[Moate railway station]] to [[Mullingar railway station|Mullingar]] could be reopened for trains from [[Galway railway station|Galway]] to [[Dublin Connolly]]. Other major infrastructural projects and plans for the county include [[Transport 21]].\n\n==Road transport==\nRoads are of good quality in the county. As part of the [[Transport 21]] infrastructure programme undertaken by the government, both the [[N4 road (Ireland)|N4]] and [[N6 road (Ireland)|N6]] roads have been upgraded to [[motorway]] or [[dual carriageway]] standard. All towns that these roads passed through are now bypassed, such as [[Mullingar]], [[Athlone]], [[Moate]] and [[Kinnegad]]. Both [[Dublin]] and [[Galway]] are within commuting distance from Westmeath following the completion of the [[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6 motorway]] in December 2009.\n* [[Midlands Gateway|Midlands (ATM) Gateway]]\n* [[National Development Plan]]\n* [[Transport 21]]\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Athlone IT.jpg|thumb|The [[Athlone IT]] International Arena in [[Athlone]]]]\n\nWestmeath is an active sporting county. The [[Westmeath GAA]] senior [[Gaelic football|football]] team won the [[Leinster Senior Football Championship]], the Delaney Cup, in 2004. They also won the National Football League [[2015 National Football League (Ireland)#Division 2|Division 2]] in 2001, 2003 and 2008. The Westmeath senior [[hurling]] team has enjoyed much recent success winning the [[Christy Ring Cup]] in 2005, 2007 and 2010.\n\n[[Athlone Town F.C.]] have won the League of Ireland Championship on two occasions, in 1980 and 1982, and the [[FAI Cup]] in 1924.\n\nWestmeath Ladies won the 2011 All-Ireland Intermediate Football Championship.\n\n[[Athlone Institute of Technology]] boasts a \u20ac10 million international athletics arena, which opened in early 2013. The International Arena has a footprint of 6,818m2 and an overall building floor area of 9,715m2. Some 850 tonnes of structural steel and fifty thousand concrete blocks went into the construction of the facility, which can house two thousand spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ait.ie/internationalarena/|title=AIT International Arena|work=ait.ie|access-date=14 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118072003/http://www.ait.ie/internationalarena/|archive-date=18 January 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWestmeath Snooker Ranking Tournaments officially recognised by The Republic of Ireland Billiards & Snooker Association are organised and run by St Mary's Snooker Club Bishopgate Street Mullingar.

At the 2016 census, the population of the county was 88,770.<ref name=cso2016/>\n\n== History ==\nFollowing the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], the territory of the Gaelic [[Kingdom of Meath]] formed the basis for the Anglo-Norman [[Lordship of Meath]] granted by King [[Henry II of England]] to [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Hugh de Lacy]] in 1172. Following the failure of de Lacy's male heirs in 1241, the Lordship was split between two great-granddaughters. One moiety, a central eastern portion, was awarded to [[Maud de Lacy, Baroness Geneville|Maud]] (de Geneville) as the [[County palatine|liberty]] of [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]]; the other moiety, comprising north-eastern and western portions, went to Maud's sister Margery (de Verdun) and in 1297 became the [[County Meath|royal county of Meath]]. The liberty and royal county were merged in 1461. While the east of the county was in the [[English Pale]], the west was [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelicised]] in the fourteenth century and outside the control of the [[High Sheriff of Meath|sheriff of Meath]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Steven G.|title=Defending English Ground: War and Peace in Meath and Northumberland, 1460\u20131542 |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=oxcaCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA62 |pages=62\u201364 |accessdate=2015-06-24|date=2015-05-07|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199696291}}</ref>\n\nAs a part of the better administration of the newly established [[Kingdom of Ireland]], the [[Parliament of Ireland]] passed the [[Counties of Meath and Westmeath Act 1543]], the eastern portion retaining the name Meath and the western portion called Westmeath.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Statutes at Large passed at the Parliaments held in Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXhaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA232|volume=1: 1310 to 1612|year=1765|publisher=B.

Athlone developed due to its military significance, and its strategic location on the main Dublin\u2013Galway route across the [[River Shannon]]. Mullingar gained considerable advantage from the development of the [[Royal Canal]]. The canal facilitated cheap transport of produce to Dublin, Britain and Europe. Athlone and Mullingar expanded further with the coming of the [[Midland Great Western Railway]] network in the nineteenth century.\n\nTourism in Westmeath is generally based on its many water amenities. The county lakes include [[Lough Derravaragh]], [[Lough Ennell]], [[Lough Owel]], [[Lough Lene]], [[Lough Sheelin]] and [[Lough Ree]]. Both the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]], and the Royal Canal flow through Westmeath, and the [[River Shannon]] (Ireland's key tourism waterway) has a modern inland harbour in Athlone.\n\nIn 2017 the largest employment sectors within Westmeath were:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibec.ie/IBEC/Press/PressPublicationsdoclib3.nsf/vPages/Newsroom%7Eibec-highlights-need-to-address-infrastructure-imbalance-15-02-2017/$file/Local+Economic+Indicators+2017.pdf |title=Eibic highlights |date=2017 |website=www.ibec.ie |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Athone - Mullingar section of the Dublin \u2013 Galway Greenway, along the old railway corridor between Athlone and Mullingar, was constructed in 2015. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.westmeathcoco.ie/en/ourservices/tourismartsrecreation/greenway/|title=Westmeath County Council - Westmeath Royal Canal Greenway<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=westmeathcoco.ie|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\nThe Royal Canal Greenway takes tourists from the county boundary to Mullingar, and then on towards Longford. Those wishing to use the Dublin-Galway Greenway can transfer from the Royal Canal route to the old rail corridor onwards towards Athlone.\n\nThe development of industry in Westmeath has been mainly based on food processing and consumer products. Whiskey is distilled in Kilbeggan and tobacco is processed in Mullingar. The county has an extensive beef and dairy trade. In recent times, the manufacturer [[Alkermes (company)|Alkermes]] has located in Athlone. The eastern part of the county is home to commuters, many of whom work at the technology parks on the western side of [[Dublin]].\n\nMullingar is renowned for the high quality of its beef and veal. Weaned cattle from the west of the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] are fattened for market on the lush [[grassland]]s of Meath and Westmeath. The cattle are also used to maintain grassland to help sustain wildlife in the areas fringing the [[Bog of Allen]].\n\nWestmeath is home to many stud farms. The plains of Westmeath, covered in calcium-rich [[marl]], contribute significantly to calcification of foal bones during their formative years. Westmeath mares are usually put into foal in spring to facilitate summer growth. Pregnancy lasts for approximately 335\u2013340 days and usually results in one foal. Horses mature when they are around four years old.\n\n==Railways==\nWestmeath also has railway infrastructure with a number of trains passing through towns in the county. The [[Dublin\u2013Westport/Galway railway line]] runs through the county, with services from [[Dublin Heuston]] to [[Galway railway station|Galway]]/[[Westport railway station, Mayo|Westport]]/[[Ballina railway station|Ballina]] inter-city train service stops at [[Athlone railway station|Athlone]], while the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line]] service stops at [[Mullingar railway station|Mullingar]].  The line from [[Athlone railway station|Athlone]] via [[Moate railway station]] to [[Mullingar railway station|Mullingar]] could be reopened for trains from [[Galway railway station|Galway]] to [[Dublin Connolly]]. Other major infrastructural projects and plans for the county include [[Transport 21]].\n\n==Road transport==\nRoads are of good quality in the county. As part of the [[Transport 21]] infrastructure programme undertaken by the government, both the [[N4 road (Ireland)|N4]] and [[N6 road (Ireland)|N6]] roads have been upgraded to [[motorway]] or [[dual carriageway]] standard. All towns that these roads passed through are now bypassed, such as [[Mullingar]], [[Athlone]], [[Moate]] and [[Kinnegad]]. Both [[Dublin]] and [[Galway]] are within commuting distance from Westmeath following the completion of the [[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6 motorway]] in December 2009.\n* [[Midlands Gateway|Midlands (ATM) Gateway]]\n* [[National Development Plan]]\n* [[Transport 21]]\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Athlone IT.jpg|thumb|The [[Athlone IT]] International Arena in [[Athlone]]]]\n\nWestmeath is an active sporting county. The [[Westmeath GAA]] senior [[Gaelic football|football]] team won the [[Leinster Senior Football Championship]], the Delaney Cup, in 2004. They also won the National Football League [[2015 National Football League (Ireland)#Division 2|Division 2]] in 2001, 2003 and 2008. The Westmeath senior [[hurling]] team has enjoyed much recent success winning the [[Christy Ring Cup]] in 2005, 2007 and 2010.\n\n[[Athlone Town F.C.]] have won the League of Ireland Championship on two occasions, in 1980 and 1982, and the [[FAI Cup]] in 1924.\n\nWestmeath Ladies won the 2011 All-Ireland Intermediate Football Championship.\n\n[[Athlone Institute of Technology]] boasts a \u20ac10 million international athletics arena, which opened in early 2013. The International Arena has a footprint of 6,818m2 and an overall building floor area of 9,715m2.

The station is owned by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]. WFXL's studios are located on Stuart Avenue in Albany, and its transmitter is located east of [[Doerun, Georgia|Doerun]] along the [[Colquitt County, Georgia|Colquitt]]\u2013[[Worth County, Georgia|Worth]] county line. The station transmits Fox programming in the network's native [[720p]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] format but airs local newscasts and [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming in [[Video scaler|unconverted]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:top20banner2L.jpg|thumb|left|Its previous logo.]]\n\nThe station signed on February 14, 1982 as '''WTSG-TV''', Southwestern Georgia's first [[independent station (North America)|independent]] station. It was founded by black physician Carl Gordon Jr. The station's original studio facilities were located on North Slappey Boulevard/[[U.S. Route 82 in Georgia|US 82]] in Albany. It became a charter Fox affiliate on October 6, 1986. Gordon sold the station to NewSouth Broadcasting in 1987. The station changed its call letters to the current '''WFXL''' in 1989.\n\nClarion Broadcasting purchased the station in 1996. Clarion then sold WFXL to the Wicks Broadcast Group (which also owned fellow Fox affiliates [[KCIT]] in [[Amarillo, Texas]], [[KJTL]] in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]]\u2013[[Lawton, Oklahoma]], and [[WPGX]] in [[Panama City, Florida]] as well as [[NBC]] affiliate [[KMTR]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]]). in 1998. In March 1999, Waitt Broadcasting bought the station from Wicks. [[Raycom Media]] acquired the outlet in December 2003 through its purchase of most of Waitt Media's stations. In March 2006, Raycom announced the sale of WFXL and eleven other stations to [[Barrington Broadcasting]] in order to meet [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules regarding station ownership. The company had just acquired the [[Liberty Corporation]], owner of [[NBC]] affiliate [[WALB]], which it decided to keep.<ref>http://www.mysouthwestga.com/about/about.aspx?id=60722</ref>\n\nOn June 1, 2006, a [[MH-47 Chinook]] military chopper traveling from [[Hunter Army Airfield]] in [[Savannah, Georgia]] to [[Fort Rucker]] in [[Alabama]] for a training mission hit a guy wire connected to WFXL's {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} tower resulting in a crash. While the tower and WALB's one nearby remained standing other than some guy wires, the stations were forced to temporarily cease over-the-air signals; broadcasts on [[cable television|cable]] were not affected. If the WFXL tower had collapsed, this could have also caused WALB's to topple as both were only {{convert|150|ft|m|0}} apart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walb.com/Global/story.asp?S=4974569|title=Army locks down crash scene, searches debris|publisher=[[WALB]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walb.com/Global/story.asp?S=4982365|title=Tower vigil, crash probe both continue|publisher=[[WALB]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walb.com/Global/story.asp?S=4980571|title=Specialists measure damaged tower|publisher=[[WALB]]}}</ref> As a result, Raycom (which at that time still operated WFXL while the sale to Barrington awaited FCC approval) acquired auxiliary transmitters and antennas for both WFXL and WALB which were installed at a backup tower at WALB's studios in Albany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walb.com/Global/story.asp?S=4986092|title=WFXL antenna mounted on WALB city tower|publisher=[[WALB]]}}</ref>\n\nOn June 7, the WFXL tower was demolished, but in doing so one of the tower's guy wires wrapped around one for WALB's tower, as feared. As a result, that station's tower collapsed in an incident shown on live television. Since both stations were already transmitting their signals from the tower at the WALB studios they were still on the air but at [[low-power broadcasting#Television|low-power]]. Thirteen months later, a new tower for both WFXL and WALB was constructed and began broadcasting on July 3 at 11:35&nbsp;p.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walb.com/Global/story.asp?S=5002278|title=Demolition attempt brings down both TV towers|publisher=[[WALB]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walb.com/Global/story.asp?S=5006920|title=Expert dissects tower collapse|publisher=[[WALB]]}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfZwJ3w3OL0</ref> \n\nOn February 28, 2013, Barrington Broadcasting announced the sale of its entire group, including WFXL, to the Sinclair Broadcast Group.<ref name=b&c-saletosinclair>{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Michael|title=Sinclair's Chesapeake TV Acquires Barrington Stations|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/492113-Sinclair_s_Chesapeake_TV_Acquires_Barrington_Stations.php|accessdate=March 1, 2013|newspaper=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=February 28, 2013}}</ref> The sale was completed on November 25.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sbgi.net/site_mgr/temp/Barrington%20Closes.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013631/http://www.sbgi.net/site_mgr/temp/Barrington%20Closes.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The station's second [[digital subchannel]] began carrying programming from Sinclair's [[American Sports Network]] syndication package starting with its inaugural broadcast on August 30, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Minium|first1=Harry|title=ODU's opener with Hampton to be televised in 66 markets|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2014/08/odus-opener-hampton-be-televised-66-markets|accessdate=September 8, 2014 |work=HamptonRoads.com|publisher=The Virginian-Pilot|date=August 27, 2014}}</ref> As a result of subsequent acquisitions by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, WFXL is sister to company-owned station clusters in [[Pensacola, Florida]]\u2013[[Mobile, Alabama]], [[Gainesville, Florida]], and [[Tallahassee, Florida]].\n\n==Digital television==\n\n===Digital channels===\nThe station's digital signal is [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Along with WALB, WFXL is one of two stations in Albany to produce local news that actually focus on the city ([[WSWG]], the [[media market|market]]'s [[CBS]] affiliate, does make newscasts but provides no news coverage of Albany).\n\nIn order to offer comprehensive [[severe weather]] coverage, WFXL purchased the most technologically advanced and powerful computerized weather system available in 2007. This included access to live [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar]] capabilities from the [[National Weather Service]] site at [[Moody Air Force Base]] and an automated severe weather warning system.\n\nIn September 2008, WFXL gave its newscasts a new look by means of updating it graphic package and the construction of a new set. At the same time, it added a half hour to its weeknight prime time news at 10.<ref>http://www.wfxl.com/about/about.aspx?id=60722</ref> It had aired, at one point, a weeknight newscast at 6:30 that competed with the national news shows on the [[Big Three television networks|big three]] stations. However, on September 19, 2011, WFXL replaced this newscast with a two-hour comedy block of syndicated programming. On October 24, 2011, it added a fourth hour to its weekday morning show which can now be seen from 5 until 9 a.m.\n\nOn January 22, 2016, WFXL dropped its four-hour morning show and replaced it with syndicated and E/I programming.<ref>[https://changingnewscasts.wordpress.com/2016/01/26/wfxl-no-longer-have-good-day-has-stopped-airing-weekday-morning-news/ WFXL will no longer have a \u201cGood Day.\u201d It has stopped airing weekday morning news.] ''The Changing Newscasts Blog,'' January 26th, 2016.

WFXL's studios are located on Stuart Avenue in Albany, and its transmitter is located east of [[Doerun, Georgia|Doerun]] along the [[Colquitt County, Georgia|Colquitt]]\u2013[[Worth County, Georgia|Worth]] county line. The station transmits Fox programming in the network's native [[720p]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] format but airs local newscasts and [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming in [[Video scaler|unconverted]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:top20banner2L.jpg|thumb|left|Its previous logo.]]\n\nThe station signed on February 14, 1982 as '''WTSG-TV''', Southwestern Georgia's first [[independent station (North America)|independent]] station. It was founded by black physician Carl Gordon Jr. The station's original studio facilities were located on North Slappey Boulevard/[[U.S. Route 82 in Georgia|US 82]] in Albany. It became a charter Fox affiliate on October 6, 1986. Gordon sold the station to NewSouth Broadcasting in 1987. The station changed its call letters to the current '''WFXL''' in 1989.\n\nClarion Broadcasting purchased the station in 1996. Clarion then sold WFXL to the Wicks Broadcast Group (which also owned fellow Fox affiliates [[KCIT]] in [[Amarillo, Texas]], [[KJTL]] in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]]\u2013[[Lawton, Oklahoma]], and [[WPGX]] in [[Panama City, Florida]] as well as [[NBC]] affiliate [[KMTR]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]]). in 1998. In March 1999, Waitt Broadcasting bought the station from Wicks. [[Raycom Media]] acquired the outlet in December 2003 through its purchase of most of Waitt Media's stations. In March 2006, Raycom announced the sale of WFXL and eleven other stations to [[Barrington Broadcasting]] in order to meet [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules regarding station ownership. The company had just acquired the [[Liberty Corporation]], owner of [[NBC]] affiliate [[WALB]], which it decided to keep.<ref>http://www.mysouthwestga.com/about/about.aspx?id=60722</ref>\n\nOn June 1, 2006, a [[MH-47 Chinook]] military chopper traveling from [[Hunter Army Airfield]] in [[Savannah, Georgia]] to [[Fort Rucker]] in [[Alabama]] for a training mission hit a guy wire connected to WFXL's {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} tower resulting in a crash. While the tower and WALB's one nearby remained standing other than some guy wires, the stations were forced to temporarily cease over-the-air signals; broadcasts on [[cable television|cable]] were not affected. If the WFXL tower had collapsed, this could have also caused WALB's to topple as both were only {{convert|150|ft|m|0}} apart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walb.com/Global/story.asp?S=4974569|title=Army locks down crash scene, searches debris|publisher=[[WALB]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walb.com/Global/story.asp?S=4982365|title=Tower vigil, crash probe both continue|publisher=[[WALB]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walb.com/Global/story.asp?S=4980571|title=Specialists measure damaged tower|publisher=[[WALB]]}}</ref> As a result, Raycom (which at that time still operated WFXL while the sale to Barrington awaited FCC approval) acquired auxiliary transmitters and antennas for both WFXL and WALB which were installed at a backup tower at WALB's studios in Albany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walb.com/Global/story.asp?S=4986092|title=WFXL antenna mounted on WALB city tower|publisher=[[WALB]]}}</ref>\n\nOn June 7, the WFXL tower was demolished, but in doing so one of the tower's guy wires wrapped around one for WALB's tower, as feared. As a result, that station's tower collapsed in an incident shown on live television. Since both stations were already transmitting their signals from the tower at the WALB studios they were still on the air but at [[low-power broadcasting#Television|low-power]]. Thirteen months later, a new tower for both WFXL and WALB was constructed and began broadcasting on July 3 at 11:35&nbsp;p.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walb.com/Global/story.asp?S=5002278|title=Demolition attempt brings down both TV towers|publisher=[[WALB]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walb.com/Global/story.asp?S=5006920|title=Expert dissects tower collapse|publisher=[[WALB]]}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfZwJ3w3OL0</ref> \n\nOn February 28, 2013, Barrington Broadcasting announced the sale of its entire group, including WFXL, to the Sinclair Broadcast Group.<ref name=b&c-saletosinclair>{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Michael|title=Sinclair's Chesapeake TV Acquires Barrington Stations|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/492113-Sinclair_s_Chesapeake_TV_Acquires_Barrington_Stations.php|accessdate=March 1, 2013|newspaper=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=February 28, 2013}}</ref> The sale was completed on November 25.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sbgi.net/site_mgr/temp/Barrington%20Closes.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013631/http://www.sbgi.net/site_mgr/temp/Barrington%20Closes.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The station's second [[digital subchannel]] began carrying programming from Sinclair's [[American Sports Network]] syndication package starting with its inaugural broadcast on August 30, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Minium|first1=Harry|title=ODU's opener with Hampton to be televised in 66 markets|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2014/08/odus-opener-hampton-be-televised-66-markets|accessdate=September 8, 2014 |work=HamptonRoads.com|publisher=The Virginian-Pilot|date=August 27, 2014}}</ref> As a result of subsequent acquisitions by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, WFXL is sister to company-owned station clusters in [[Pensacola, Florida]]\u2013[[Mobile, Alabama]], [[Gainesville, Florida]], and [[Tallahassee, Florida]].\n\n==Digital television==\n\n===Digital channels===\nThe station's digital signal is [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Along with WALB, WFXL is one of two stations in Albany to produce local news that actually focus on the city ([[WSWG]], the [[media market|market]]'s [[CBS]] affiliate, does make newscasts but provides no news coverage of Albany).\n\nIn order to offer comprehensive [[severe weather]] coverage, WFXL purchased the most technologically advanced and powerful computerized weather system available in 2007. This included access to live [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar]] capabilities from the [[National Weather Service]] site at [[Moody Air Force Base]] and an automated severe weather warning system.\n\nIn September 2008, WFXL gave its newscasts a new look by means of updating it graphic package and the construction of a new set. At the same time, it added a half hour to its weeknight prime time news at 10.<ref>http://www.wfxl.com/about/about.aspx?id=60722</ref> It had aired, at one point, a weeknight newscast at 6:30 that competed with the national news shows on the [[Big Three television networks|big three]] stations. However, on September 19, 2011, WFXL replaced this newscast with a two-hour comedy block of syndicated programming. On October 24, 2011, it added a fourth hour to its weekday morning show which can now be seen from 5 until 9 a.m.\n\nOn January 22, 2016, WFXL dropped its four-hour morning show and replaced it with syndicated and E/I programming.<ref>[https://changingnewscasts.wordpress.com/2016/01/26/wfxl-no-longer-have-good-day-has-stopped-airing-weekday-morning-news/ WFXL will no longer have a \u201cGood Day.\u201d It has stopped airing weekday morning news.] ''The Changing Newscasts Blog,'' January 26th, 2016.
