The current lighthouse stands at the north end of [[Anastasia Island]] and was built between 1871 and 1874. The tower is the second lighthouse tower in St. Augustine, the first being lit officially by the American territorial government in May 1824 as Florida's first lighthouse. However, both the Spanish and the British governments<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Historical_Research/Turner%20El%20Escribano.pdf</ref> operated a major aid to navigation here including a series of wooden watch towers and beacons dating from 1565.<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/ourstories/LighthouseStory</ref>\n\nThe current lighthouse  tower, original first-order Fresnel Lens and the Light Station grounds are owned by the '''St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum, Inc.''', a not-for-profit maritime museum. The museum is open to the public 360 days a year. Admission fees support continued preservation of the lighthouse and five other historic structures. Admissions and museum memberships also fund programs in [[maritime archaeology]], traditional wooden boatbuilding, and maritime education. The non profit mission is to \"discover, preserve, present and keep alive the stories of the nation's oldest port<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/nha/Significance</ref> as symbolized by our working St. Augustine Lighthouse.\"\n\n==History==\n[[File:Staugustine1824.JPG|thumb|left|The St. Augustine lighthouse in 1824]]\n[[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] was the site of the first lighthouse established in Florida by the new, territorial, American Government in 1824. According to some archival records and maps, this \"official\" American lighthouse was placed on the site of an earlier watchtower built by the Spanish as early as the late 16th century.<ref>{{cite uscghist|FL|accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> A map of St. Augustine made by [[Baptista Boazio]] in 1589, depicting Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s attack on the city, shows an early wooden watch tower near the Spanish structure, which was described as a \"beacon\" in Drake's account. By 1737, Spanish authorities built a more permanent tower from [[coquina]] taken from a nearby quarry on the island.  Archival records are inconclusive as to whether the Spanish used the coquina tower as a lighthouse, but it seems plausible, given the levels of maritime trade by that time. The structure was regularly referred to as a \"lighthouse\" in documents\u2014including ship's logs and nautical charts\u2014dating to the British Period beginning in 1763.\n\nIn 1783, the Spanish once again took control of St. Augustine, and once again the lighthouse was improved. Swiss-Canadian engineer and marine surveyor [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]] marks a coquina \"Light House\" on [[Anastasia Island]] in his 1780 engraving, \"A Plan of the Harbour of St. Augustin\". [[Jacques-Nicolas Bellin]], Royal French Hydrographer, refers to the coquina tower as a \"Batise\" in Volume I of ''Petit Atlas Maritime''.  The accuracy of these scholars is debated still; DesBarres work includes some obvious errors, but Belline is considered highly qualified.  His work provides an important reference to St. Augustine's geography and landmarks in 1764.  Facing erosion and a changing coastline, the old tower crashed into the sea in 1880, but not before a new lighthouse was lit. Today, the tower ruins are a submerged archaeological site.\n\nEarly lamps in the first tower burned [[lard oil]]. Multiple lamps with silver reflectors were replaced by a fourth order [[Fresnel lens]] in 1855, greatly improving the lighthouse's range and eliminating some maintenance issues.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], future mayor Paul Arnau, a local [[Menorca]]n harbor master, along with the lightkeeper, a woman named [[Maria Andreu|Maria Mestre de los Dolores Andreu]] (who, in this role, became the first Hispanic-American woman to serve in the Coast Guard),<ref name=\"Frank2013\">{{cite book|author=Lisa Tendrich Frank|title=An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drE50WEN1WUC&pg=PA685|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-443-6|page=685}}</ref> removed the lens from the old lighthouse and hid it, in order to block Union shipping lanes. The lens and clock works were recovered after Arnau was held captive on a ship off-shore and forced to reveal their location.\n\nBy 1870, [[erosion#Shoreline|beach erosion]] was threatening the first lighthouse. Construction on a new light tower began in 1871 during Florida's reconstruction period. In the meantime, a [[jetty]] of coquina and brush was built to protect the old tower.  A trolley track brought building supplies from the ships at the dock. The new tower was completed in 1874, and put into service with a new first order Fresnel lens. It was lit for the first time in October by keeper William Russell. Russell was the first lighthouse keeper in the new tower, and the only keeper to have worked both towers.\n\nFor 20 years, the site was manned by head-keeper [[William A. Harn]] of Philadelphia.  Major Harn was a Union war hero who had commanded his own battery at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].  With his wife, Kate Skillen Harn, of [[Maine]], he had six daughters. The family was known for serving lemonade out on the  porches of the keepers' house, which was constructed as a Victorian duplex during Harn's tenure.\n\nOn August 31, 1886, the [[Charleston earthquake]] caused the tower to \"sway violently\", according to the keeper's log, but there was no recorded damage.\n\nIn 1885, after many experiments with different types of oils, the lamp was converted from lard oil to [[kerosene]].\n\nDuring World War II, Coast Guard men and women trained in St. Augustine, and used the lighthouse as a lookout post for enemy ships and submarines which frequented the coastline.\n\nIn 1907, indoor plumbing reached the light station, followed by electricity in the keeper's quarters in 1925. The light itself was electrified in 1936, and automated in 1955. As the light was automated, positions for three keepers slowly dwindled down to two and then one.  No longer housing lighthouse families by the 1960s, the keepers' house was rented to local residents. Eventually it was declared surplus, and [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns County]] bought it in 1970.  In that year the house suffered a devastating fire at the hands of an unknown arsonist.\n\n==Restoration==\nIn 1980, a small group of 15 women in the Junior Service League of St. Augustine (JSL) signed a 99-year lease with the county for the keeper's house and surrounding grounds and began a massive restoration project. Shortly after the JSL adopted the restoration, the League signed a 30-year lease with the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] to begin a restoration effort on the lighthouse tower itself. The lighthouse was subsequently placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1981 due to the efforts of local preservationist and author Karen Harvey.  \n\nThe antique lens was functional until it was damaged by rifle fire in 1986, and 19 of the prisms were broken. Lamplighter Hank Mears called the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to investigate this crime. As the lens continued to weaken, the Coast Guard considered removing it and replacing it with a more modern, airport beacon.  Again championed by the JSL, this plan was dismissed and the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall lens was restored, with the help of retired Coast Guardsmen Joe Cocking and Nick Johnston. This was the first restoration of its kind in the nation. Cocking and Johnston continue to work with Museum staff and care for the lens. Volunteers from [[Northrop Grumman]] Corporation and [[Florida Power & Light]] clean and inspect the lens and works every week.\n\nToday, the St. Augustine Light Station consists of the {{convert|165|ft|adj=on}} 1874 tower, the 1876 Keepers' House, two summer kitchens added in 1886, a 1941 U.S. Coast Guard barracks and a 1936 garage that was home to a jeep repair facility during World War II. The site is also a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] weather station.\n\n==St. Augustine Lighthouse and Maritime Museum==\n[[File:St Augustine lighthouse visitor center sign.jpg|thumb|right|Visitors' Center]]\n[[File:St. Augustine Lighthouse 3.JPG|thumb|right|View of the Keeper's House from the tower]]\n\nIn 1994, the Lighthouse Museum of St. Augustine opened full-time to the public.  A community-based board of trustees was created in 1998. The men and women of the volunteer board are charged with holding the site in trust for future generations.  In 2002, under the direction of current Executive Director Kathy Fleming, ownership of the tower and historic Fresnel lens was transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard through the [[General Services Administration]] and the [[National Park Service]] to the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Museum, Inc.  This was the first such transfer of a U.S. lighthouse to a non-profit organization. The Museum keeps the light burning as a private aid-to-navigation. In 2016 the museum changed its name to the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum.\n\nThe St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum aims to preserve local maritime history, keep alive the story of the nation's oldest port, and connect young people to [[marine science]]s.  The museum board and staff also work to help save other lighthouses in Florida and across the nation, coordinating efforts with several federal agencies and volunteer groups such as the Florida Lighthouse Association.  The Lighthouse employs close to 50 individuals, and is visited annually by over 200,000 people including 54,000 school-aged children.\n\nThe museum maintains an active [[archaeology|archaeological]] program (Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program, or LAMP) that researches maritime archaeological sites around St. Augustine and the [[First Coast]] region.  Staff archaeologists have discovered a number of historic shipwrecks and investigated many others, along with other maritime sites such as breakwaters, plantation wharf remains, and the nearby remains of St. Augustine's original lighthouse.  The museum also researches other aspects of maritime heritage including boat building and the history of the local and regional shrimping industry, and maintains a growing collection of [[World War II]] artifacts focusing on the history of the U.S. Coast Guard in St. Augustine.  The Keeper's house is used to display a series of exhibits related to these various aspects of St. Augustine's maritime history. The Lighthouse also hosts a volunteer-driven heritage boat building program, which has built a number of traditional wooden boats from various time periods in the port's history.\n\nIn early 2010, the First Light Maritime Society was established as the support organization for the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum and LAMP. The use of this fundraising organization was discontinued by the Lighthouse & Maritime Museum with its re-branding in 2016.\n\n===Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP)===\nThe St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum, as part of its ongoing mission to discover, present, and keep alive the maritime history of America's oldest port, has funded [[maritime archaeology]] in St. Johns County waters since 1997.  In 1999, the Lighthouse formalized its research program, creating the Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program, Inc. (LAMP).  LAMP is one of the few research organizations in the nation employing full-time professional marine archaeologists and conservators that is not a part of a university or government entity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lampmaritime.com/LAMP/About_LAMP/LAMP_about |title=About LAMP |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nLAMP's founding Director was William \"Billy Ray\" Morris, who oversaw archaeological research and educational programs until his departure in 2005.

The identities of both wrecks remain unknown, but the study of their remains has led to a greater understanding of the economic and technological evolution of St. Augustine at the dawn of modernity.  The latter shipwreck carried a cargo of cement in barrels which was probably intended for the city's late 19th century building boom, associated with industrialist entrepreneur [[Henry Flagler]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Research/the-centerboard-schooner-wreck |title=Centerboard Schooner Wreck |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>  In addition to these and other shipwrecks, LAMP has investigated a wide variety of archaeological sites in St. Augustine and the greater Florida [[First Coast]] region representing Florida's French, Spanish, British, and Early American periods.  These include British plantation landings, community boatyard foundations, ferry and steamboat landings, ballast dump sites, colonial wharves, and inundated terrestrial sites.

According to some archival records and maps, this \"official\" American lighthouse was placed on the site of an earlier watchtower built by the Spanish as early as the late 16th century.<ref>{{cite uscghist|FL|accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> A map of St. Augustine made by [[Baptista Boazio]] in 1589, depicting Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s attack on the city, shows an early wooden watch tower near the Spanish structure, which was described as a \"beacon\" in Drake's account. By 1737, Spanish authorities built a more permanent tower from [[coquina]] taken from a nearby quarry on the island.  Archival records are inconclusive as to whether the Spanish used the coquina tower as a lighthouse, but it seems plausible, given the levels of maritime trade by that time. The structure was regularly referred to as a \"lighthouse\" in documents\u2014including ship's logs and nautical charts\u2014dating to the British Period beginning in 1763.\n\nIn 1783, the Spanish once again took control of St. Augustine, and once again the lighthouse was improved. Swiss-Canadian engineer and marine surveyor [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]] marks a coquina \"Light House\" on [[Anastasia Island]] in his 1780 engraving, \"A Plan of the Harbour of St. Augustin\". [[Jacques-Nicolas Bellin]], Royal French Hydrographer, refers to the coquina tower as a \"Batise\" in Volume I of ''Petit Atlas Maritime''.  The accuracy of these scholars is debated still; DesBarres work includes some obvious errors, but Belline is considered highly qualified.  His work provides an important reference to St. Augustine's geography and landmarks in 1764.  Facing erosion and a changing coastline, the old tower crashed into the sea in 1880, but not before a new lighthouse was lit. Today, the tower ruins are a submerged archaeological site.\n\nEarly lamps in the first tower burned [[lard oil]]. Multiple lamps with silver reflectors were replaced by a fourth order [[Fresnel lens]] in 1855, greatly improving the lighthouse's range and eliminating some maintenance issues.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], future mayor Paul Arnau, a local [[Menorca]]n harbor master, along with the lightkeeper, a woman named [[Maria Andreu|Maria Mestre de los Dolores Andreu]] (who, in this role, became the first Hispanic-American woman to serve in the Coast Guard),<ref name=\"Frank2013\">{{cite book|author=Lisa Tendrich Frank|title=An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drE50WEN1WUC&pg=PA685|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-443-6|page=685}}</ref> removed the lens from the old lighthouse and hid it, in order to block Union shipping lanes. The lens and clock works were recovered after Arnau was held captive on a ship off-shore and forced to reveal their location.\n\nBy 1870, [[erosion#Shoreline|beach erosion]] was threatening the first lighthouse. Construction on a new light tower began in 1871 during Florida's reconstruction period. In the meantime, a [[jetty]] of coquina and brush was built to protect the old tower.  A trolley track brought building supplies from the ships at the dock. The new tower was completed in 1874, and put into service with a new first order Fresnel lens. It was lit for the first time in October by keeper William Russell. Russell was the first lighthouse keeper in the new tower, and the only keeper to have worked both towers.\n\nFor 20 years, the site was manned by head-keeper [[William A. Harn]] of Philadelphia.  Major Harn was a Union war hero who had commanded his own battery at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].  With his wife, Kate Skillen Harn, of [[Maine]], he had six daughters. The family was known for serving lemonade out on the  porches of the keepers' house, which was constructed as a Victorian duplex during Harn's tenure.\n\nOn August 31, 1886, the [[Charleston earthquake]] caused the tower to \"sway violently\", according to the keeper's log, but there was no recorded damage.\n\nIn 1885, after many experiments with different types of oils, the lamp was converted from lard oil to [[kerosene]].\n\nDuring World War II, Coast Guard men and women trained in St. Augustine, and used the lighthouse as a lookout post for enemy ships and submarines which frequented the coastline.\n\nIn 1907, indoor plumbing reached the light station, followed by electricity in the keeper's quarters in 1925. The light itself was electrified in 1936, and automated in 1955. As the light was automated, positions for three keepers slowly dwindled down to two and then one.  No longer housing lighthouse families by the 1960s, the keepers' house was rented to local residents. Eventually it was declared surplus, and [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns County]] bought it in 1970.  In that year the house suffered a devastating fire at the hands of an unknown arsonist.\n\n==Restoration==\nIn 1980, a small group of 15 women in the Junior Service League of St. Augustine (JSL) signed a 99-year lease with the county for the keeper's house and surrounding grounds and began a massive restoration project. Shortly after the JSL adopted the restoration, the League signed a 30-year lease with the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] to begin a restoration effort on the lighthouse tower itself. The lighthouse was subsequently placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1981 due to the efforts of local preservationist and author Karen Harvey.  \n\nThe antique lens was functional until it was damaged by rifle fire in 1986, and 19 of the prisms were broken. Lamplighter Hank Mears called the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to investigate this crime. As the lens continued to weaken, the Coast Guard considered removing it and replacing it with a more modern, airport beacon.  Again championed by the JSL, this plan was dismissed and the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall lens was restored, with the help of retired Coast Guardsmen Joe Cocking and Nick Johnston. This was the first restoration of its kind in the nation. Cocking and Johnston continue to work with Museum staff and care for the lens. Volunteers from [[Northrop Grumman]] Corporation and [[Florida Power & Light]] clean and inspect the lens and works every week.\n\nToday, the St. Augustine Light Station consists of the {{convert|165|ft|adj=on}} 1874 tower, the 1876 Keepers' House, two summer kitchens added in 1886, a 1941 U.S. Coast Guard barracks and a 1936 garage that was home to a jeep repair facility during World War II. The site is also a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] weather station.\n\n==St. Augustine Lighthouse and Maritime Museum==\n[[File:St Augustine lighthouse visitor center sign.jpg|thumb|right|Visitors' Center]]\n[[File:St. Augustine Lighthouse 3.JPG|thumb|right|View of the Keeper's House from the tower]]\n\nIn 1994, the Lighthouse Museum of St. Augustine opened full-time to the public.  A community-based board of trustees was created in 1998. The men and women of the volunteer board are charged with holding the site in trust for future generations.  In 2002, under the direction of current Executive Director Kathy Fleming, ownership of the tower and historic Fresnel lens was transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard through the [[General Services Administration]] and the [[National Park Service]] to the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Museum, Inc.  This was the first such transfer of a U.S. lighthouse to a non-profit organization. The Museum keeps the light burning as a private aid-to-navigation. In 2016 the museum changed its name to the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum.\n\nThe St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum aims to preserve local maritime history, keep alive the story of the nation's oldest port, and connect young people to [[marine science]]s.  The museum board and staff also work to help save other lighthouses in Florida and across the nation, coordinating efforts with several federal agencies and volunteer groups such as the Florida Lighthouse Association.  The Lighthouse employs close to 50 individuals, and is visited annually by over 200,000 people including 54,000 school-aged children.\n\nThe museum maintains an active [[archaeology|archaeological]] program (Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program, or LAMP) that researches maritime archaeological sites around St. Augustine and the [[First Coast]] region.  Staff archaeologists have discovered a number of historic shipwrecks and investigated many others, along with other maritime sites such as breakwaters, plantation wharf remains, and the nearby remains of St. Augustine's original lighthouse.  The museum also researches other aspects of maritime heritage including boat building and the history of the local and regional shrimping industry, and maintains a growing collection of [[World War II]] artifacts focusing on the history of the U.S. Coast Guard in St. Augustine.  The Keeper's house is used to display a series of exhibits related to these various aspects of St. Augustine's maritime history. The Lighthouse also hosts a volunteer-driven heritage boat building program, which has built a number of traditional wooden boats from various time periods in the port's history.\n\nIn early 2010, the First Light Maritime Society was established as the support organization for the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum and LAMP. The use of this fundraising organization was discontinued by the Lighthouse & Maritime Museum with its re-branding in 2016.\n\n===Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP)===\nThe St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum, as part of its ongoing mission to discover, present, and keep alive the maritime history of America's oldest port, has funded [[maritime archaeology]] in St. Johns County waters since 1997.  In 1999, the Lighthouse formalized its research program, creating the Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program, Inc. (LAMP).  LAMP is one of the few research organizations in the nation employing full-time professional marine archaeologists and conservators that is not a part of a university or government entity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lampmaritime.com/LAMP/About_LAMP/LAMP_about |title=About LAMP |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nLAMP's founding Director was William \"Billy Ray\" Morris, who oversaw archaeological research and educational programs until his departure in 2005.

Artifacts from the wreck site\u2014including eight cast-iron [[cannon]], an iron [[swivel gun]], crates of iron shot, iron mooring anchors, [[millstone]]s, and boxes of tools such as axes, shovel blades, knives, trowels, files, and handsaws\u2014were well-preserved, and provided an unprecedented glimpse into the needs of British soldiers and administrators on the Florida frontier.  Many of these items were recovered and conserved by LAMP archaeologists, and have been on display in the maritime museum in the Lighthouse keeper's house.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Research/british_ship |title=British Sloop ''Industry'' |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themua.org/exhibit_industry/ |title=''Industry'' Exhibit Introduction |publisher=Museum of Underwater Archaeology |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Franklin |first=Marianne |year=2000 |url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/CRL/Report10/introduction.html |title=Site 8SJ3478, possibly the ''Industry'': a British 18th-century shipwreck |publisher=Conservation Research Laboratory (Texas A&M University)}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Diver&shipsbell.jpg|thumb|left|LAMP archaeologist recording the ship's bell discovered on the 18th century \"Storm Wreck.\"]]\nIn 2009, LAMP archaeologists discovered the second oldest shipwreck in northeast Florida waters, an unidentified colonial sailing vessel known as the \"Storm Wreck\".

The identities of both wrecks remain unknown, but the study of their remains has led to a greater understanding of the economic and technological evolution of St. Augustine at the dawn of modernity.  The latter shipwreck carried a cargo of cement in barrels which was probably intended for the city's late 19th century building boom, associated with industrialist entrepreneur [[Henry Flagler]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Research/the-centerboard-schooner-wreck |title=Centerboard Schooner Wreck |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>  In addition to these and other shipwrecks, LAMP has investigated a wide variety of archaeological sites in St. Augustine and the greater Florida [[First Coast]] region representing Florida's French, Spanish, British, and Early American periods.  These include British plantation landings, community boatyard foundations, ferry and steamboat landings, ballast dump sites, colonial wharves, and inundated terrestrial sites.

Voters chose 33 representatives, or electors to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], who voted for [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].\n\n[[New York (state)|New York]] was won by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate, [[List of governors of Arkansas|Governor]] [[Bill Clinton]] of [[Arkansas]] who received 49.73% of the vote over incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[George H. W. Bush]] of [[Texas]], who received 33.88%. [[Independent politician|Independent]] candidate [[Ross Perot]], a billionaire Texas businessman, finished in third, with 15.75% of the popular vote.<ref name=results/> Clinton ultimately won the national election, defeating incumbent President Bush.<ref>{{cite web|title=1992 Presidential General Election Results|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1992|publisher=U.S. Election Atlas|accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nClinton's double-digit 15.85% margin of victory would mark the beginning of a dramatic shift toward the Democratic Party in New York, from a Democratic leaning [[swing state]] to a solidly [[Red states and blue states|blue state]] that Democrats would carry by landslide margins in every election since. In the preceding 6 elections, the state had gone Republican three times and Democratic 3 times, all but once decided by a single-digit margin. In the 6 elections that have followed 1992, Democratic presidential candidates have received between 58% and 64% of the vote, making it one of the most overwhelmingly Democratic states in the nation, largely as a result of trends that began in 1992. \n\nDespite Ross Perot\u2019s strong showing as a third-party candidate, taking votes away from the major party nominees statewide and nationally, Clinton increased the total Democratic vote share in the five heavily populated boroughs of [[New York City]] to 69% in 1992, compared to the 66% received by Democrat [[Michael Dukakis]] in the [[1988 United States presidential election in New York|1988 election]], while Bush fell from 33% in 1988 to only 24% in his re-election bid. \n\nIn addition, Clinton also picked up wins in heavily populated suburban counties around New York City that had long been reliably Republican, namely [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] just north of the city, and [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] on [[Long Island]], which have remained loyally Democratic in every election that has followed, as well as [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. Bush only carried [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] by 1.5%, down from a landslide 21.8% victory margin in that county in 1988. Republican dominance of the populous suburbs had been crucial to previous Republican victories in the state in order to overcome the massive Democratic advantage in New York City. As the city became even more Democratic while downstate suburban voters defected from the GOP to the Democrats, Republican hopes of competing in New York State would vanish following this election.    \n\nBush performed more strongly in traditionally Republican upstate New York, where he won most rural counties, although he lost a number of counties he had won in 1988 to Clinton. Clinton won a handful of rural upstate counties, and more significantly scored strong wins in counties home to the cities of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and the [[college town]] of [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], all of which have become reliable Democratic bastions in upstate New York.\n\nClinton's victory margin would make New York State about 10% more Democratic than the nation as a whole in the 1992 election. {{As of|2016|11|alt=As of the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]]}}, this is the last election in which [[Clinton County, New York|Clinton County]] and [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]] voted for a Republican presidential candidate.<ref name=\"how\">Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century \u2018How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century\u2019]; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref>\n\n==Results==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1992 United States presidential election in New York<ref name=results>{{cite web|title=1992 Presidential General Election Results - New York|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=1992&fips=36&f=0&off=0&elect=0&minper=0|publisher=U.S. Election Atlas|accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref>\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n| ''Bill Clinton''\n| align=\"right\" | 3,346,894\n| align=\"right\" | 48.32%\n| align=\"right\" |\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#CC0000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal]]\n| ''Bill Clinton''\n| align=\"right\" | 97,556\n| align=\"right\" | 1.41%\t\n| align=\"right\" |\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#B2BEB5; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | '''Total'''\n| '''[[Bill Clinton]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''3,444,450'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''49.73%'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''33'''\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n| ''George H.

Voters chose 33 representatives, or electors to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], who voted for [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].\n\n[[New York (state)|New York]] was won by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate, [[List of governors of Arkansas|Governor]] [[Bill Clinton]] of [[Arkansas]] who received 49.73% of the vote over incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[George H. W. Bush]] of [[Texas]], who received 33.88%. [[Independent politician|Independent]] candidate [[Ross Perot]], a billionaire Texas businessman, finished in third, with 15.75% of the popular vote.<ref name=results/> Clinton ultimately won the national election, defeating incumbent President Bush.<ref>{{cite web|title=1992 Presidential General Election Results|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1992|publisher=U.S. Election Atlas|accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nClinton's double-digit 15.85% margin of victory would mark the beginning of a dramatic shift toward the Democratic Party in New York, from a Democratic leaning [[swing state]] to a solidly [[Red states and blue states|blue state]] that Democrats would carry by landslide margins in every election since. In the preceding 6 elections, the state had gone Republican three times and Democratic 3 times, all but once decided by a single-digit margin. In the 6 elections that have followed 1992, Democratic presidential candidates have received between 58% and 64% of the vote, making it one of the most overwhelmingly Democratic states in the nation, largely as a result of trends that began in 1992. \n\nDespite Ross Perot\u2019s strong showing as a third-party candidate, taking votes away from the major party nominees statewide and nationally, Clinton increased the total Democratic vote share in the five heavily populated boroughs of [[New York City]] to 69% in 1992, compared to the 66% received by Democrat [[Michael Dukakis]] in the [[1988 United States presidential election in New York|1988 election]], while Bush fell from 33% in 1988 to only 24% in his re-election bid. \n\nIn addition, Clinton also picked up wins in heavily populated suburban counties around New York City that had long been reliably Republican, namely [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] just north of the city, and [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] on [[Long Island]], which have remained loyally Democratic in every election that has followed, as well as [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. Bush only carried [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] by 1.5%, down from a landslide 21.8% victory margin in that county in 1988. Republican dominance of the populous suburbs had been crucial to previous Republican victories in the state in order to overcome the massive Democratic advantage in New York City. As the city became even more Democratic while downstate suburban voters defected from the GOP to the Democrats, Republican hopes of competing in New York State would vanish following this election.    \n\nBush performed more strongly in traditionally Republican upstate New York, where he won most rural counties, although he lost a number of counties he had won in 1988 to Clinton. Clinton won a handful of rural upstate counties, and more significantly scored strong wins in counties home to the cities of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and the [[college town]] of [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], all of which have become reliable Democratic bastions in upstate New York.\n\nClinton's victory margin would make New York State about 10% more Democratic than the nation as a whole in the 1992 election. {{As of|2016|11|alt=As of the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]]}}, this is the last election in which [[Clinton County, New York|Clinton County]] and [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]] voted for a Republican presidential candidate.<ref name=\"how\">Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century \u2018How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century\u2019]; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref>\n\n==Results==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1992 United States presidential election in New York<ref name=results>{{cite web|title=1992 Presidential General Election Results - New York|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=1992&fips=36&f=0&off=0&elect=0&minper=0|publisher=U.S. Election Atlas|accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref>\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n| ''Bill Clinton''\n| align=\"right\" | 3,346,894\n| align=\"right\" | 48.32%\n| align=\"right\" |\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#CC0000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal]]\n| ''Bill Clinton''\n| align=\"right\" | 97,556\n| align=\"right\" | 1.41%\t\n| align=\"right\" |\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#B2BEB5; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | '''Total'''\n| '''[[Bill Clinton]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''3,444,450'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''49.73%'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''33'''\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n| ''George H.W.

{"title_page": "Lothario", "text_new": "{{short description|Male seducer of women}}\n{{Charles}}\n{{For|other similar names|Lothar|Lothair (disambiguation){{!}}Lothair}}\n'''Lothario''' or Barry Gutler is a male given name that came to suggest an unscrupulous seducer of women, based upon a character in ''The Impertinent Curious Man'', a [[story within a story]] in [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' 1605 novel, ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n\n==''The Man Who Was Recklessly Curious''==\n''Don Quixote, Part One'' contains stories that do not directly involve the two main characters, but which are narrated by some of the [[picaresque]] figures encountered by Quixote and Sancho during their travels.  The longest and best known story is, ''El Curioso Impertinente'' (''The Impertinently Curious Man''), in Part One, Book Four, chapters 33\u201335. It is a story-within-a-story that is read to a group of travellers at an inn, about a [[Florence|Florentine]] nobleman, Anselmo, who becomes obsessed with testing his wife's fidelity and talks his close friend, Lothario, into attempting to seduce her. \n\nIn ''Part Two'', the author acknowledges criticism of his digressions in ''Part One'' and promises to concentrate the narrative on the central characters. At one point he laments, however, that his narrative muse has been constrained by the change in the writing style.\n\n===''El Curioso Impertinente'' summary===\nThe story within the story relates that for no particular reason, Anselmo decides to test the fidelity of his wife, Camilla, and asks his friend, Lothario, to seduce her. Thinking that to be madness, Lothario reluctantly agrees, and soon reports to Anselmo that Camilla is a faithful wife. Anselmo learns that Lothario has lied and attempted no seduction. He makes Lothario promise to try in earnest and leaves town to make this easier. Lothario tries and Camilla writes letters to her husband telling him of the attempts by Lothario and asking him to return. Anselmo makes no reply and does not return. Lothario then falls in love with Camilla, who eventually reciprocates, an affair between them ensues, but is not disclosed to Anselmo, and their affair continues after Anselmo returns.\n\nOne day, Lothario sees a man leaving Camilla's house and jealously presumes she has taken another lover. He tells Anselmo that, at last, he has been successful and arranges a time and place for Anselmo to see the seduction. Before this rendezvous, however, Lothario learns that the man was the lover of Camilla's maid. He and Camilla then contrive to deceive Anselmo further: when Anselmo watches them, she refuses Lothario, protests her love for her husband, and stabs herself lightly in the breast. Anselmo is reassured of her fidelity. The affair restarts with Anselmo none the wiser.\n\nLater, the maid's lover is discovered by Anselmo. Fearing that Anselmo will kill her, the maid says she will tell Anselmo a secret the next day. Anselmo tells Camilla that this is to happen and Camilla expects that her affair is to be revealed. Lothario and Camilla flee that night. The maid flees the next day. Anselmo searches for them in vain before learning from a stranger of his wife's affair. He starts to write the story, but dies of grief before he can finish.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\"Lothario\" also is a character in Goethe's novel Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship (1795-96) and also in the play, ''[[The Fair Penitent]]'' (1703), by [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]], based on the earlier seventeenth-century play, ''[[The Fatal Dowry]]'' (which drew on Cervantes).<ref>J. a.
