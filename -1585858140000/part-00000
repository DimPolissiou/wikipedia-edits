All traditional farming is now considered to be \"[[organic farming]]\" although at the time there were no known inorganic methods. For example, [[forest gardening]], a fully organic food production system which dates from [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]], is thought to be the world's oldest and most resilient [[agroecosystem]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design |author=Douglas John McConnell |year=2003 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&lpg=PP1&dq=the%20forest%20farms%20of%20kandy%20and%20other%20gardens%20of%20complete%20design&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=9780754609582}}</ref> After the industrial revolution had introduced inorganic methods, most of which were not well developed and had serious side effects. An organic movement began in the 1940s as a reaction to agriculture's growing reliance on synthetic [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s. The history of this modern revival of organic farming dates back to the first half of the 20th century at a time when there was a growing reliance on these new synthetic, non-organic methods.\n\n==Pre-World War II==\nThe first 40 years of the 20th century saw simultaneous advances in biochemistry and engineering that rapidly and profoundly changed farming. The introduction of the gasoline-powered [[internal combustion engine]] ushered in the era of the [[tractor]] and made possible [[list of agricultural machinery|hundreds of mechanized farm implements]]. Research in [[plant breeding]] led to the commercialization of [[hybrid seed]]. And a new manufacturing process made nitrogen fertilizer &mdash; first synthesized in the mid-19th century<ref>{{cite book | title = A short history of twentieth-century technology c. 1900-c. 1950 | author1 = Trevor Illtyd Williams | author2 = Thomas Kingston Derry | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-19-858159-9 | pages = 134\u2013135}}</ref> &mdash; affordably abundant. These factors changed the labor equation: there were almost no tractors in the US around 1910, but over 3,000,000 by 1950; in 1900, it took one farmer to feed 2.5 people, but currently the ratio is 1 to well over 100. Fields grew bigger and cropping more specialized to make more efficient use of machinery. The reduced need for [[manual labour]] and [[working animal|animal labour]] that machinery, herbicides, and fertilizers made possible created an era in which the [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization of agriculture]] evolved rapidly.\n\nConsciously organic agriculture (as opposed to traditional agricultural methods from before the inorganic options existed, which always employed only organic means) began more or less simultaneously in Central Europe and India. The British botanist [[Sir Albert Howard]] is often referred to as the father of modern organic agriculture, because he was the first to apply modern scientific knowledge and methods to traditional agriculture. From 1905 to 1924, he and his wife [[Gabrielle Howard|Gabrielle]], herself a plant physiologist, worked as agricultural advisers in [[Pusa]], [[Bengal]], where they documented traditional Indian farming practices and came to regard them as superior to their conventional agriculture science. Their research and further development of these methods is recorded in his writings, notably, his 1940 book, ''[[An Agricultural Testament]]'', which influenced many scientists and farmers of the day.\n\nIn Germany, [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s development, [[biodynamic agriculture]], was probably the first comprehensive system of what we now call organic farming. This began with a lecture series Steiner presented at a farm in Koberwitz ([[Kobierzyce]] now in Poland) in 1924.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Paull John | year = 2011 | title = Attending the First Organic Agriculture Course: Rudolf Steiner's Agriculture Course at Koberwitz, 1924 | url = http://orgprints.org/18809/1/Paull2011KoberwitzEJSS.pdf | format = PDF | journal = European Journal of Social Sciences | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 64\u201370 }}</ref> Steiner emphasized the farmer's role in guiding and balancing the interaction of the animals, plants and soil.

[http://orgprints.org/10138/ The Farm as Organism: The Foundational Idea of Organic Agriculture.] Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania (80), pp. 14-18.</ref> basing this on Steiner's agricultural principles and methods. One year previously to his book's publication, James had hosted the first Biodynamic Agriculture conference in England, the [[Betteshanger|Betteshanger Summer School and Conference]], at which [[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]] was the key presenter.<ref name=Betteshanger>Paull, John (2011) \"The Betteshanger Summer School: Missing link between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming\", Journal of Organic Systems, 2011, 6(2): pp. 14-18.</ref> \n\nIn 1939 James, Albert Howard, Ehrenfried Pfeiffer and George Stapleton joined at Farleigh to implement an experiment comparing Biodynamic, organic and chemical fertilization methods. \"The Farleigh Experiment\", had been planned since initial meetings in 1936 including ten participants. The experiment was cut short due to the fact that Biodynamic compost was not available until after the Betteshanger Summer School event, the disruption of the impending war, and lack of funding. Though inconclusive, this experiment was seen as providing impetus for the similar \"Haughley Experiment\" described below. \n \nIn 1939 [[Lady Eve Balfour]], who had been farming since 1920 in Haughley Green, Suffolk, England, launched the [[Haughley Experiment]]. Lady Balfour believed that mankind's health and future depended on how the soil was used, and that non-intensive farming could produce more wholesome food. The experiment was run to generate data to test these beliefs.<ref name=gordon>{{cite book|title=Reproductive Technologies in Farm Animals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rItfbxpris0C&pg=PA10 |year=2004 |publisher=CABI|isbn=978-0-85199-049-1 |pages=10\u2013|first=Ian|last=Gordon}}</ref> Four years later, she published ''[[The Living Soil]]'', based on the initial findings of the Haughley Experiment. Widely read, it led to the formation of a key international organic advocacy group, the [[Soil Association]].\n\nIn Japan, [[Masanobu Fukuoka]], a microbiologist working in [[soil science]] and plant pathology, began to doubt the modern agricultural movement. In 1937, he quit his job as a research scientist, returned to his family's farm in 1938, and devoted the next 60 years to developing a radical no-till organic method for growing grain and many other crops, now known as {{nihongo|[[natural farming]]|\u81ea\u7136\u8fb2\u6cd5|shizen n\u014dh\u014d}}, nature farming, 'do\u2013nothing' farming or Fukuoka farming.\n\n==Post-World War II==\nTechnological advances during [[World War II]] accelerated post-war innovation in all aspects of agriculture, resulting in large advances in mechanization (including large-scale irrigation), fertilization, and pesticides. In particular, two chemicals that had been produced in quantity for warfare, were repurposed for peacetime agricultural uses. [[Ammonium nitrate]], used in munitions, became an abundantly cheap source of nitrogen. And a range of new pesticides appeared: [[DDT]], which had been used to control disease-carrying insects around troops, became a general insecticide, launching the era of widespread [[pesticide]] use.\n\nAt the same time, increasingly powerful and sophisticated farm machinery allowed a single farmer to work larger areas of land and fields grew bigger.\n\nIn 1944, an international campaign called the [[Green Revolution]] was launched in Mexico with private funding from the US. It encouraged the development of hybrid plants, chemical controls, large-scale irrigation, and heavy mechanization in agriculture around the world.\n\nDuring the 1950s, sustainable agriculture was a topic of scientific interest, but research tended to concentrate on developing the new chemical approaches. One of the reasons for this, which informed and guided the ongoing Green Revolution, was the widespread belief that high [[world population|global population growth]], which was demonstrably occurring, would soon create worldwide food shortages unless humankind could rescue itself through ever higher agricultural technology. At the same time, however, the adverse effects of \"modern\" farming continued to kindle a small but growing organic movement. For example, in the US, [[Jerome Irving Rodale|J.I. Rodale]] began to popularize the term and methods of organic growing, particularly to consumers through promotion of [[organic gardening]].\n\nIn 1962, [[Rachel Carson]], a prominent scientist and naturalist, published ''[[Silent Spring]]'', chronicling the effects of DDT and other pesticides on the environment.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://orgprints.org/10961/ | publisher =  Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania | title = Rachel Carson, A Voice for Organics - the First Hundred Years |year=2007 | author = Paull, John | pages =(86) 37\u201341}}</ref> A bestseller in many countries, including the US, and widely read around the world, ''Silent Spring'' is widely considered as being a key factor in the US government's 1972 banning of [[DDT]]. The book and its author are often credited with launching the worldwide [[environmental movement]].\n\nIn the 1970s, global movements concerned with pollution and the environment increased their focus on organic farming. As the distinction between organic and conventional food became clearer, one goal of the [[organic movement]] was to encourage consumption of [[local food|locally grown food]], which was promoted through slogans like \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\".\n\nIn 1972, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements ([[IFOAM]]) was founded in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]],<ref>Paull, John (2010) [http://www.academia.edu/9192738/From_France_to_the_World_The_International_Federation_of_Organic_Agriculture_Movements_IFOAM_ \u201cFrom France to the World: The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM)\u201d], Journal of Social Research & Policy. 1 (2): 93\u2013102.</ref> France and dedicated to the diffusion and exchange of information on the principles and practices of organic agriculture of all schools and across national and linguistic boundaries.\n\nIn 1975, Fukuoka released his book, ''[[The One-Straw Revolution]]'', with a strong impact in certain areas of the agricultural world. His approach to small-scale grain production emphasized a meticulous balance of the local farming [[ecosystem]], and a minimum of human interference and labor.\n\nIn the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, [[J. I. Rodale|J.I. Rodale]] and his Rodale Press (now [[Rodale, Inc.]]) led the way in getting Americans to think about the side effects of nonorganic methods, and the advantages of organic ones. The press's books offered how-to information and advice to Americans interested in trying organic gardening and farming.\n\nIn 1984, [[Oregon Tilth]] established an early organic certification service in the United States.<ref name=\"washingtontilth\">{{cite web|url=http://washingtontilth.org/history.htm|title=WA Tilth Association History|last=Musick|first=Mark|publisher=Washington Tilth|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, around the world, farming and consumer groups began seriously pressuring for government regulation of organic production. This led to legislation and certification standards being enacted through the 1990s and to date. In the United States, the [[Organic Foods Production Act of 1990]] tasked the USDA with developing national standards for organic products, and the final rule establishing the National Organic Program was first published in the [[Federal Register]] in 2000<ref>{{USFR|65|80548}} (December 21, 2000)</ref>\n\nIn [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], the loss of Soviet economic support following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to a focus on local agricultural production and the development of a unique state-supported urban organic agriculture program called [[organop\u00f3nicos]].\n\nSince the early 1990s, the retail market for organic farming in developed economies has been growing by about 20% annually due to increasing consumer demand. Concern for the quality and safety of food, and the potential for environmental damage from conventional agriculture, are apparently responsible for this trend.\n\n==Twenty-first century==\n\nThroughout this history, the focus of agricultural research and the majority of publicized scientific findings has been on chemical, not organic, farming. This emphasis has continued to biotechnologies like genetic engineering. One recent survey of the UK's leading government funding agency for bioscience research and training indicated 26 GM crop projects, and only one related to organic agriculture.{{ref|www.bbsrc.ac.uk.168}} This imbalance is largely driven by agribusiness in general, which, through [[research funding]] and government lobbying, continues to have a predominating effect on agriculture-related science and policy.\n\nAgribusiness is also changing the rules of the organic market. The rise of organic farming was driven by small, independent producers and by consumers. In recent years, explosive organic market growth has encouraged the participation of agribusiness interests. As the volume and variety of \"organic\" products increases, the viability of the small-scale organic farm is at risk, and the meaning of organic farming as an agricultural method is ever more easily confused with the related but separate areas of organic food and organic certification.\n\nAs efforts to protect our environment increase, as does the popularity of sustainable produce. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/agriculture/organic-farming|title=U.S. EPA|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>Agricultural chemicals, pesticides, and fertilizers contaminate our environment though run-off into water sources. The chemicals also deplete the integrity of farmland. Certified organic standards from the EPA do not allow for the use of these toxic chemicals in farming. The ability to support a sustainable business is why organic farming has become more popular.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Biodynamic agriculture]]\n*[[Organic farming]]\n*[[Organic food]]\n*[[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]]\n*[[Organic Farming Digest]]\n*[[Principles of Organic Agriculture]]\n*[[Australian Organic Farming and Gardening Society]]\n*[[Living Soil Association of Tasmania]]\n*[[Agriculture]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Agriculture footer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Organic Farming}}\n[[Category:Organic farming| ]]\n[[Category:History of agriculture]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=January 2014}}\n{{Agriculture|history}}\nTraditional farming (of many particular kinds in different eras and places) was the original type of [[agriculture]], and has been practiced for thousands of years.

[http://orgprints.org/10138/ The Farm as Organism: The Foundational Idea of Organic Agriculture.] Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania (80), pp. 14-18.</ref> basing this on Steiner's agricultural principles and methods. One year previously to his book's publication, James had hosted the first Biodynamic Agriculture conference in England, the [[Betteshanger|Betteshanger Summer School and Conference]], at which [[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]] was the key presenter.<ref name=Betteshanger>Paull, John (2011) \"The Betteshanger Summer School: Missing link between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming\", Journal of Organic Systems, 2011, 6(2): pp. 14-18.</ref> \n\nIn 1939 James, Albert Howard, Ehrenfried Pfeiffer and George Stapleton joined at Farleigh to implement an experiment comparing Biodynamic, organic and chemical fertilization methods. \"The Farleigh Experiment\", had been planned since initial meetings in 1936 including ten participants. The experiment was cut short due to the fact that Biodynamic compost was not available until after the Betteshanger Summer School event, the disruption of the impending war, and lack of funding. Though inconclusive, this experiment was seen as providing impetus for the similar \"Haughley Experiment\" described below. \n \nIn 1939 [[Lady Eve Balfour]], who had been farming since 1920 in Haughley Green, Suffolk, England, launched the [[Haughley Experiment]]. Lady Balfour believed that mankind's health and future depended on how the soil was used, and that non-intensive farming could produce more wholesome food. The experiment was run to generate data to test these beliefs.<ref name=gordon>{{cite book|title=Reproductive Technologies in Farm Animals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rItfbxpris0C&pg=PA10 |year=2004 |publisher=CABI|isbn=978-0-85199-049-1 |pages=10\u2013|first=Ian|last=Gordon}}</ref> Four years later, she published ''[[The Living Soil]]'', based on the initial findings of the Haughley Experiment. Widely read, it led to the formation of a key international organic advocacy group, the [[Soil Association]].\n\nIn Japan, [[Masanobu Fukuoka]], a microbiologist working in [[soil science]] and plant pathology, began to doubt the modern agricultural movement. In 1937, he quit his job as a research scientist, returned to his family's farm in 1938, and devoted the next 60 years to developing a radical no-till organic method for growing grain and many other crops, now known as {{nihongo|[[natural farming]]|\u81ea\u7136\u8fb2\u6cd5|shizen n\u014dh\u014d}}, nature farming, 'do\u2013nothing' farming or Fukuoka farming.\n\n==Post-World War II==\nTechnological advances during [[World War II]] accelerated post-war innovation in all aspects of agriculture, resulting in large advances in mechanization (including large-scale irrigation), fertilization, and pesticides. In particular, two chemicals that had been produced in quantity for warfare, were repurposed for peacetime agricultural uses. [[Ammonium nitrate]], used in munitions, became an abundantly cheap source of nitrogen. And a range of new pesticides appeared: [[DDT]], which had been used to control disease-carrying insects around troops, became a general insecticide, launching the era of widespread [[pesticide]] use.\n\nAt the same time, increasingly powerful and sophisticated farm machinery allowed a single farmer to work larger areas of land and fields grew bigger.\n\nIn 1944, an international campaign called the [[Green Revolution]] was launched in Mexico with private funding from the US. It encouraged the development of hybrid plants, chemical controls, large-scale irrigation, and heavy mechanization in agriculture around the world.\n\nDuring the 1950s, sustainable agriculture was a topic of scientific interest, but research tended to concentrate on developing the new chemical approaches. One of the reasons for this, which informed and guided the ongoing Green Revolution, was the widespread belief that high [[world population|global population growth]], which was demonstrably occurring, would soon create worldwide food shortages unless humankind could rescue itself through ever higher agricultural technology. At the same time, however, the adverse effects of \"modern\" farming continued to kindle a small but growing organic movement. For example, in the US, [[Jerome Irving Rodale|J.I. Rodale]] began to popularize the term and methods of organic growing, particularly to consumers through promotion of [[organic gardening]].\n\nIn 1962, [[Rachel Carson]], a prominent scientist and naturalist, published ''[[Silent Spring]]'', chronicling the effects of DDT and other pesticides on the environment.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://orgprints.org/10961/ | publisher =  Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania | title = Rachel Carson, A Voice for Organics - the First Hundred Years |year=2007 | author = Paull, John | pages =(86) 37\u201341}}</ref> A bestseller in many countries, including the US, and widely read around the world, ''Silent Spring'' is widely considered as being a key factor in the US government's 1972 banning of [[DDT]]. The book and its author are often credited with launching the worldwide [[environmental movement]].\n\nIn the 1970s, global movements concerned with pollution and the environment increased their focus on organic farming. As the distinction between organic and conventional food became clearer, one goal of the [[organic movement]] was to encourage consumption of [[local food|locally grown food]], which was promoted through slogans like \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\".\n\nIn 1972, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements ([[IFOAM]]) was founded in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]],<ref>Paull, John (2010) [http://www.academia.edu/9192738/From_France_to_the_World_The_International_Federation_of_Organic_Agriculture_Movements_IFOAM_ \u201cFrom France to the World: The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM)\u201d], Journal of Social Research & Policy. 1 (2): 93\u2013102.</ref> France and dedicated to the diffusion and exchange of information on the principles and practices of organic agriculture of all schools and across national and linguistic boundaries.\n\nIn 1975, Fukuoka released his book, ''[[The One-Straw Revolution]]'', with a strong impact in certain areas of the agricultural world. His approach to small-scale grain production emphasized a meticulous balance of the local farming [[ecosystem]], and a minimum of human interference and labor.\n\nIn the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, [[J. I. Rodale|J.I. Rodale]] and his Rodale Press (now [[Rodale, Inc.]]) led the way in getting Americans to think about the side effects of nonorganic methods, and the advantages of organic ones. The press's books offered how-to information and advice to Americans interested in trying organic gardening and farming.\n\nIn 1984, [[Oregon Tilth]] established an early organic certification service in the United States.<ref name=\"washingtontilth\">{{cite web|url=http://washingtontilth.org/history.htm|title=WA Tilth Association History|last=Musick|first=Mark|publisher=Washington Tilth|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, around the world, farming and consumer groups began seriously pressuring for government regulation of organic production. This led to legislation and certification standards being enacted through the 1990s and to date. In the United States, the [[Organic Foods Production Act of 1990]] tasked the USDA with developing national standards for organic products, and the final rule establishing the National Organic Program was first published in the [[Federal Register]] in 2000<ref>{{USFR|65|80548}} (December 21, 2000)</ref>\n\nIn [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], the loss of Soviet economic support following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to a focus on local agricultural production and the development of a unique state-supported urban organic agriculture program called [[organop\u00f3nicos]].\n\nSince the early 1990s, the retail market for organic farming in developed economies has been growing by about 20% annually due to increasing consumer demand. Concern for the quality and safety of food, and the potential for environmental damage from conventional agriculture, are apparently responsible for this trend.\n\n==Twenty-first century==\n\nThroughout this history, the focus of agricultural research and the majority of publicized scientific findings has been on chemical, not organic, farming. This emphasis has continued to biotechnologies like genetic engineering. One recent survey of the UK's leading government funding agency for bioscience research and training indicated 26 GM crop projects, and only one related to organic agriculture.{{ref|www.bbsrc.ac.uk.168}} This imbalance is largely driven by agribusiness in general, which, through [[research funding]] and government lobbying, continues to have a predominating effect on agriculture-related science and policy.\n\nAgribusiness is also changing the rules of the organic market. The rise of organic farming was driven by small, independent producers and by consumers. In recent years, explosive organic market growth has encouraged the participation of agribusiness interests. As the volume and variety of \"organic\" products increases, the viability of the small-scale organic farm is at risk, and the meaning of organic farming as an agricultural method is ever more easily confused with the related but separate areas of organic food and organic certification.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Biodynamic agriculture]]\n*[[Organic farming]]\n*[[Organic food]]\n*[[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]]\n*[[Organic Farming Digest]]\n*[[Principles of Organic Agriculture]]\n*[[Australian Organic Farming and Gardening Society]]\n*[[Living Soil Association of Tasmania]]\n*[[Agriculture]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Agriculture footer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Organic Farming}}\n[[Category:Organic farming| ]]\n[[Category:History of agriculture]]\n", "name_user": "Hannahbbull", "label": "safe", "comment": "I added information to  the end", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_organic_farming"}

It became important in the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th and 20th centuries, when it was primarily used to power steam engines, heat buildings and generate electricity. Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today. Compared to [[wood fuel]]s, coal yields a higher amount of energy per mass and can often be obtained in areas where wood is not readily available. Though it was used historically as a domestic fuel, coal is now used mostly in industry, especially in [[smelting]] and [[alloy]] production as well as [[electricity generation]]. Large-scale [[coal mining]] developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]], and coal provided the main source of [[primary energy]] for industry and transportation in industrial areas from the 18th century to the 1950s. Coal remains an important energy source because of its low cost and abundance compared to other fuels, particularly for electricity generation.<ref name=\"Freese. 2004\">{{cite book|author=Barbara Freese|title=Coal: A Human History|url=https://archive.org/details/coalhumanhistory00free/page/137|year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=[https://archive.org/details/coalhumanhistory00free/page/137 137]|isbn=9780142000984|url-access=registration}}(stating that, \"[c]oal consumption doubled every decade between 1850 and 1890\" and that by turn of the century, \"coal was the unrivaled foundation of U.S. Power,\" providing \"71 percent of the nation's energy.\"</ref> Coal is also mined today on a large scale by [[open pit]] methods wherever the coal [[stratum|strata]] strike the surface or are relatively shallow.

The technology was far in advance of any coal mining method in the late medieval period and was considered one of the industrial wonders of the age.<ref>{{citation | series = The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature | title = From Columba to the Union (Until 10707) | first = Ian | last = Brown}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th century a number of advances in mining techniques were made, such the use of [[Boring (earth)|test boring]] to find suitable deposits and [[chain pump]]s, driven by [[water wheel]]s, to drain the collieries.<ref name = \"Galloway 1882\" />{{rp |57\u20139}}\n\nNorth American coal deposits were first discovered by French explorers and fur traders along the shores of Grand Lake in central New Brunswick, Canada in the 1600s. Coal seams were exposed where rivers flowed into the lake and was dug by hand off the surface and from tunnels dug into the seam. About 1631 the French made their fur trading post at the mouth of the Saint John River their main post in Acadia and started construction of a new fort. The main residence at the fort was designed with two 11 foot wide fireplaces which were stocked with wood and coal from up river. As early as 1643, the French were sending coal and other supplies to the British colony at Boston.\n<ref>Coal Association of Canada, Coal Kit, Coal Evolution module, Digging up the Past http://www.coal.ca/coal-kit {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302115642/http://www.coal.ca/coal-kit/ |date=2016-03-02 }}</ref><ref>Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada (monument in Minto, NB for earliest export of coal) http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=1012</ref><ref>John Winthrop, The Journal of John Winthrop 1630 \u2013 1649, Harvard University / Massachusetts Historical Society, 1996, page 474 (Massachusetts Bay Colony Governor's description of their August 1643 receipt of a ship load of coal from 20 leagues up the Saint John River)</ref><ref>M.A. MacDonald, Fortune & La Tour, The Civil War in Acadia, Toronto, 1983 / Halifax, 2000, Chapter 8  (description of the 1640 use of \"coal from up river\" in the main residence of the French fort at the mouth of the Saint John River)</ref>\n\n==Industrial Revolution==\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the 18th century, and later spread to continental [[Europe]], [[North America]], and [[Japan]], was based on the availability of coal to power [[steam engine]]s. International trade expanded exponentially when coal-fed steam engines were built for the [[railway]]s and [[steamship]]s during the [[Victorian era]]. Coal was cheaper and much more efficient than [[wood fuel]] in most steam engines. As central and [[Northern England]] contains an abundance of coal, many mines were situated in these areas as well as the [[South Wales coalfield]] and [[Scotland]]. The small-scale techniques were unsuited to the increasing demand, with extraction moving away from surface extraction to deep [[shaft mining]] as the Industrial Revolution progressed.<ref>Flinn and Stoker (1984)</ref>\n\nAs [[steamship]]s traveled overseas from the industrialized countries of Europe their need for coal served as trigger for coal mining to start at various locations across the globe.

The location of the [[coalfield]]s helped to make the prosperity of [[Lancashire]], of [[Yorkshire]], and of [[South Wales]]. The Yorkshire pits which supplied [[Sheffield]] were only about 300 feet deep. [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]] were the leading coal producers and they were the sites of the first deep pits. In much of Britain coal was worked from [[drift mine]]s, or scraped off when it outcropped on the surface. Small groups of part-time miners used shovels and primitive equipment.\n\nScottish miners had been bonded to their \"maisters\" by a 1606 Act \"Anent Coalyers and Salters\". A [[Colliers and Salters (Scotland) Act 1775]], recognised this to be \"a state of slavery and bondage\" and formally abolished it; this was made effective by a further law in 1799.<ref>{{cite web|title =Erskine May on Slavery in Britain (Vol. III, Chapter XI) | url =http://www.pdavis.nl/ErskineMay.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=James Barrowman, Mining Engineer |title =Slavery In The Coal-Mines Of Scotland |date= 14 September 1897 |publisher=Scottish Mining Website | url =http://www.scottishmining.co.uk/429.html | accessdate = 2017-11-02 }}</ref>\n\nBefore 1800 a great deal of coal was left in places as extraction was still primitive. As a result, in the deep [[Tyneside]] pits (300 to 1,000&nbsp;ft deep) only about 40 percent of the coal could be extracted. The use of wooden pit props to support the roof was an innovation first introduced about 1800. The critical factor was circulation of air and control of dangerous explosive gases. At first fires were burned at the bottom of the \"upcast\" shaft to create air currents and circulate air, but replaced by fans driven by steam engines. Protection for miners came with the invention of the [[Davy lamp]] and [[Geordie lamp]], where any [[firedamp]] (or [[methane]]) burnt harmlessly within the lamp. It was achieved by preventing the combustion spreading from the light chamber to the outside air with either metal gauze or fine tubes, but the illumination from such lamps was very poor. Great efforts were made to develop better safe lamps, such as the Mueseler produced in the Belgian pits near [[Li\u00e8ge]].\n\nCoal was so abundant in Britain that the supply could be stepped up to meet the rapidly rising demand. In 1700 the annual output of coal was just under 3 million tons. Between 1770 and 1780 the annual output of coal was some 6\u00bc million [[long ton]]s (or about the output of a week and a half in the 20th century). After 1790 output soared, reaching 16 million long tons by 1815 at the height of the [[Napoleonic War]]. By 1830 this had risen to over 30 million tons<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=A Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave|pages=109\u201310}}</ref> The miners, less affected by imported labour or machines than were the [[cotton mill]] workers, had begun to form [[trade union]]s and fight their grim battle for wages against the coal owners and royalty-lessees.<ref>J.

Henderson</ref>\n\nIn South Wales, the miners showed a high degree of solidarity. They lived in isolated villages where the miners comprised the great majority of workers. There was a high degree of equality in life style; combined with an evangelical religious style based on Methodism this led to an ideology of egalitarianism. They forged a \"community of solidarity\" - under the leadership of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|Miners Federation]]. The union supported first the Liberal Party, then after 1918 Labour, with some Communist Party activism at the fringes.<ref name=\"Stefan Llafur Berger 2001 pp 5-40\">Stefan Llafur Berger, \"Working-Class Culture and the Labour Movement in the South Wales and the Ruhr Coalfields, 1850-2000: A Comparison,\" ''Journal of Welsh Labour History/Cylchgrawn Hanes Llafur Cymru'' (2001) 8#2 pp 5-40.</ref>\n\n===Post2020222\nThe need to maintain coal supplies (a primary energy source) had figured in both [[world war]]s.<ref name=\"Fine 1990\">Fine (1990)</ref> As well as energy supply, coal became a very political issue, due to conditions under which colliers worked and the way they were treated by colliery owners. Much of the 'old [[Left-wing politics|Left]]' of British politics can trace its origins to coal-mining areas, with the main labor union being the [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain]], founded in 1888. The MFGB claimed 600,000 members in 1908. (The MFGB later became the more centralised [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]]).\n\nAlthough other factors were involved, one cause of the [[UK General Strike of 1926]] was concerns colliers had over very dangerous working conditions, reduced pay and long shifts.\n\nTechnological development throughout the 19th and 20th centuries helped both to improve the safety of colliers and the productive capacity of collieries they worked. In the late 20th century, improved integration of coal extraction with bulk industries such as electrical generation helped coal maintain its position despite the emergence of alternative energy supplies such as oil, natural gas and, from the late 1950s, [[nuclear power]] used for electricity. More recently coal has faced competition from renewable energy sources and biofuels.\n\nMost of the coal mines in Britain were purchased by the government in 1947 and put under the control of the [[National Coal Board]], with only the smaller mines left in private ownership. The NUM had campaigned for nationalization for decades and, once it was achieved, sought to work with the NCB in managing the industry and discouraged strikes. Under the chairmanship of [[Alf Robens]], pit closures became widespread as coal's place in energy generation declined. The NUM leadership continued to resist calls for strike action, but an [[UK miners' strike (1969)|unofficial strike began in 1969]] after a conference pledge on the hours of surface-workers was not acted upon. This was a watershed moment that led to increased spending on the coal industry and a much slower rate of pit closures, as well as the election of more militant officials to the NUM leadership. Under the government of Ted Heath, an [[UK miners' strike (1972)|official strike in 1972]] won increased wages after the Wilberforce Commission. Less than two years later, Heath called a general election over another official strike, called after an overtime ban had led to a [[Three Day Week]] in Britain, and lost the election to the Labour Party. The wage demands were then met and spending on the industry continued to increase, including the establishment of the new [[Selby Coalfield]].\n\nBy the early 1980s, many pits were almost 100 years old and were considered uneconomic<ref>Margaret Thatcher, quoted in B. Fine, The coal question: political economy and industrial change from the Nineteenth Century to the present day</ref> to work at current wage rates compared to cheap [[North Sea oil]] and gas, and in comparison to subsidy levels in [[Europe]]. [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|The Miners' Strike of 1984]] failed to stop the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government's plans under [[Margaret Thatcher]] to shrink the industry, and a break-away [[Union of Democratic Mineworkers]] was founded by miners, mostly in the Midlands, who felt that the NUM had broken its own democratic rules in calling the strike. The [[National Coal Board]] (by then [[British Coal]]), was privatised by selling off a large number of pits to private concerns through the mid-1990s. Because of exhausted seams, high prices and cheap imports, the mining industry disappeared almost completely, despite the militant protests of some miners.<ref name=\"Fine 1990\"/><ref>Ben Curtis, \"A Tradition of Radicalism: The Politics of the South Wales Miners, 1964-1985,\" ''Labour History Review'' (2011) 76#1 pp 34-50</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, the [[South Wales Valleys]] last deep pit mine, [[Tower Colliery]] in Hirwaun, [[Rhondda Cynon Taff]] closed with the loss of 120 jobs.

[[Deerpark Mines]] was the largest opencast site. In 1919 it got rail connections and reached peak production in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Alan McCutcheon|title=The Industrial Archaeology of Northern Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypR3QWtmBRoC&pg=PA108-IA27|year=1984|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson U.P.|page=108|isbn=9780838631256}}</ref>\n\n==United States==\n{{Main|History of coal mining in the United States}}\n\n[[Anthracite]] (or \"hard\" coal), clean and smokeless, became the preferred fuel in cities, replacing wood by about 1850.

New soft coal fields opened in [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]] and [[Illinois]], as well as [[West Virginia]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Alabama]].

Lewis]], the United Mine Workers (UMW) became the dominant force in the coal fields in the 1930s and 1940s, producing high wages and benefits.<ref>Dubofsky and Van Tine (1977)</ref> In 1914 at the peak there were 180,000 anthracite miners; by 1970 only 6,000 remained. At the same time [[steam engine]]s were phased out in railways and factories, and [[bituminous coal]] was used primarily for the generation of [[electricity]]. Employment in bituminous peaked at 705,000 men in 1923, falling to 140,000 by 1970 and 70,000 in 2003. UMW membership among active miners fell from 160,000 in 1980 to only 16,000 in 2005, as coal mining became more mechanized and non-union miners predominated in the new coal fields.\n\nIn the 1960s a series of mergers saw coal production shift from small, independent coal companies to large, more diversified firms. Several oil companies and electricity producers acquired coal companies or leased Federal coal reserves in the west of the United States. Concerns that competition in the coal industry could decline as a result of these changes were heightened by a sharp rise in coal prices in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Coal prices fell in the 1980s, partly in response to oil price movements, but primarily in response to the large increase in supply worldwide which was brought about by the earlier price surge. During this period, the industry in the U.S. was characterized by a move towards low-sulfur coal.<ref>[http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/retail.aspx?indid=108&chid=7 \"Coal Mining Industry Report\"] IBISWorld, 2009''</ref>\n\nIn 1987 Wyoming became the largest coal producing state.

Coal is used primarily to generate electricity, but the rapid drop in natural gas prices after 2008 created severe competition.\n\n==Australia==\nIn 1984 Australia surpassed the US as the world's largest coal exporter. One-third of Australia's coal exports were shipped from the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, where coal mining and transport had begun nearly two centuries earlier. Coal River was the first name given by British settlers to the Hunter River after coal was found there in 1795. In 1804 the Sydney-based administration established a permanent convict settlement near the mouth of the Hunter River to mine and load the coal, predetermining the town's future as a coal port by naming it Newcastle. Today, Newcastle, NSW, is the largest coal port in the world.\nNow the state of Queensland is Australia's top coal producer, with its Bowen Basin the main source of black coal, and plans by miners such as [[Gina Rinehart]] to open up the Galilee and Surat Basins to coal mining.\n\n==Canada==\nCanadian coal mining started in New Brunswick and also occurred in Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. The United States has been a major supplier for the industrial regions of [[Ontario]]. By 2000 about 19% of Canada's energy was supplied by coal, much of it imported from the U.S while Eastern Canadian ports import considerable coal from [[Venezuela]].\n\n===New Brunswick===\n\nThe first coal mining in North America began in New Brunswick, Canada in the early 1600s. Coal was found by French explorers and fur traders along the shores of Grand Lake where rivers and erosion had exposed the coal. Small amounts of coal were dug from surface deposits and tunnels dug into the coal seams, and this coal supplied Fort Saint Marie, built by the French about 1632 at the mouth of the Saint John River. The French sold coal to the British colony at Boston as early as 1639. Due to this earliest export of coal in North America, Grand Lake has been recognized as a Canadian Historic Site . Coal mining expanded after the British took control of the area in the mid 1700s and encouraged permanent settlements in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario by British Loyalists. Beginning in 1765, over 11,000 Loyalists settled in N.B., most along the lower 100 miles of the Saint John River and around Grand Lake. Approximately 200,000 tons of coal were dug at Grand Lake between 1639 and 1887 using surface collection, vertical shafts and the room and pillar system. By 1920, the use of draglines and other modern equipment made strip mining possible and the privately owned Grand Lake area mines produced over 200,000 tons per year. Most of this coal was used by the railroad and large businesses. By 1936, a coal burning electric power generating plant at Newcastle Creek was operating with two 33,000 volt lines going to Fredericton and one 66,000 volt line going to Marysville. By 1950, coal production at Grand Lake often reached 1 million tons per year. In 1969, all the privately owned Grand Lake area coal companies and approximately 1,000 employees were consolidated into one provincial government controlled company named N.B. Coal Ltd.. In 2009, the increasing availability of oil and environmental concerns with coal use caused the closing of the Grand Lake coal mines and New Brunswick's coal mining industry.\n\n=== Nova Scotia===\n[[File:Stellarton FoordSeam 077.JPG|thumb|left|Foord Coal Seam, [[Stellarton, Nova Scotia|Stellarton]]]]\nThe first coal mining in Nova Scotia began in the 18th century with small hand-dug mines close to the sea at [[Joggins, Nova Scotia]] and in the [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] area of [[Cape Breton Island]]. Large scale coal mining began in the late 1830s when the General Mining Association (GMA), a group of English mining investors, obtained a coal mining monopoly in Nova Scotia. They imported the latest in mining technology including steam water pumps and railways to develop large mines in the [[Stellarton, Nova Scotia|Stellarton]] area of [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia]], including the Foord Pit which by 1866 was the deepest coal mine in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/about/museumsite.aspx |title=\"History of the Site\", ''Nova Scotia Museum of Industry'' |access-date=2011-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317051008/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/about/museumsite.aspx |archive-date=2011-03-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Coal mining also developed in [[Springhill, Nova Scotia|Springhill]] and [[Joggins]] in [[Cumberland County, Nova Scotia]]. After the GMA monopoly expired, the largest and longest lasting mines developed at [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]] in [[Nova Scotia]]. Nova Scotia was the major supplier of Canadian coal until 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/novascotiaindustry/coalmining/default.aspx |title=\"Coal Mining\", ''Nova Scotia Museum of Industry'' |access-date=2011-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318064424/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/novascotiaindustry/coalmining/default.aspx |archive-date=2011-03-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At its peak in 1949 25,000 miners dug 17 million metric tons of coal from Nova Scotian mines. The miners, who lived in company towns, became politically active in [[left-wing politics]] during labour struggles for safety and fair wages. [[Westray Mine]] near Stellarton closed in 1992 after an explosion killed 26 miners. All the subsurface mines were closed by 2001, although some open pit coal mining continues near Stellarton. The [[Nova Scotia Museum of Industry]] at Stellarton explores the history of mining in the province from its location on the site of the Foord Pit.\n\n===Alberta===\nCoal was easy to find in what is now [[Drumheller]], [[Alberta]], Canada. The [[Atlas Coal Mine]] National Historic Site has turned this coalfield into a museum. This museum interprets how the [[Blackfoot]] and [[Cree]] knew about the \"black rock that burned.\" After many explorers reported coal in the area, a handful of ranchers and homesteaders dug out the coal for their homes. [[Sam Drumheller]] started the coal rush in this area when he bought the land from a local rancher, which he then sold to the [[Canadian National Railway]]. Sam Drumheller also registered a coal mine. However, before his mine opened [[Jesse Gouge]] and [[Garnet Coyle]] beat him to it by opening the [[Newcastle Mine]]. Once the railway was built thousands of people came to mine this area.\n\nBy the end of 1912, there were nine working coal mines, in [[Newcastle, Alberta|Newcastle]], Drumheller, [[Midland, Alberta|Midland]], [[Rosedale, Alberta|Rosedale]], and [[Wayne, Alberta|Wayne]]. In years to follow more mines sprang up: [[Nacmine, Alberta|Nacmine]], [[Cambria, Alberta|Cambria]], Willow Creek, Lehigh, and [[East Coulee, Alberta|East Coulee]]. The timing of the Drumheller mine industry was \"lucky\" according to the Atlas National Historical Site, in that the [[United Mine Workers]] union had recently won the right for better working conditions. As a result of union action, child labour laws were passed to prevent boys under 14 years old working underground.<ref>Robert McIntosh, ''Boys in the pits: Child labour in coal mines'' (McGill-Queen's Press-MQUP, 2000)</ref>\n\nMiners' camps in this area were called \"hell's holes\" because miners lived in tents and shacks. These camps were filled with drinking, gambling and watching fistfights as forms of recreation. With time, living conditions improved: little houses took the place of the tents, and more women joined the men and started families. With new activities such as hockey, baseball and theatre the camps were no longer \"hell's holes\" but became \"the wonder town of the west.\"\n\nBetween 1911 and 1979, 139 mines were registered in the [[Drumheller Valley]], of which only 34 were productive for many years. The beginning of the end for the Drumheller mining industry was the discovery of oil at [[Leduc No. 1]] in 1947, after which [[natural gas]] became the predominant fuel for heating homes in western Canada. As the demand for coal dropped, mines closed and communities suffered. Some communities, Willow Creek for example, completely vanished while others went from boomtowns to ghost towns.\n\nAtlas #4 Mine shipped its last load of coal in 1979, after which the Atlas Coal Mine National Historic Site has preserved the last of the Drumheller mines. Also nearby, [[East Coulee School Museum]] interprets the life of families in mine towns for its visitors.<ref>[http://www.atlascoalmine.ab.ca/] \"Atlas Coal Mine National Historical Site\"</ref>\n\n==France==\n[[Image:Courri\u00e8res 1906 LeJ.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'' the 1906 Courri\u00e8res mine disaster in France]]\n\nPierre-Francois Tubeuf laid the foundations of the modern industry in France, starting in 1770 in Languedoc.<ref>Gwynne Lewis, ''The Advent of Modern Capitalism in France, 1770-1840: The Contribution of Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Tubeuf'' (1993) [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198228950.003.0002 online]</ref> Labor unions emerged with an emphasis on the safety issue in the late 19th century.

Unions gain strength by setting up a system of worker elected mine-safety delegates.

In 1782 the [[Krupp]] family began operations near [[Essen]]. After 1815 entrepreneurs in the [[Ruhr Area]], which then became part of [[Prussia]] took advantage of the tariff zone ([[Zollverein]]) to open new mines and associated [[iron]] smelters. New railways were built by British engineers around 1850. Numerous small industrial centres sprang up, focused on [[ironworks]], using local coal. The iron and [[steel]] works typically bought mines, and erected [[coking]] ovens to supply their own requirements in [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] and gas. These integrated coal-iron firms (\"Huettenzechen\") became numerous after 1854; after 1900 they became mixed firms called \"Konzern.\"\n\nThe average output of a mine in 1850 was about 8,500 short tons; its employment about 64. By 1900, the average mine's output had risen to 280,000 and the employment to about 1,400.<ref>{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=Why was Britain first? The Industrial revolution in global context|url=https://www.academia.edu/1940258|work=Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref> Total [[Ruhr]] coal output rose from 2.0 million short tons in 1850 to 22 in 1880, 60 in 1900, and 114 in 1913, on the verge of war. In 1932 output was down to 73 million short tons, growing to 130 in 1940. Output peaked in 1957 (at 123 million), declining to 78 million short tons in 1974.<ref>Pounds (1952)</ref> At the end of 2010 five coal mines were producing in Germany. The last hard coal mine in Germany closed on december 21st 2018.\n\nThe miners in the Ruhr region were divided by ethnicity (with Germans and Poles) and religion (Protestants and Catholics). Mobility in and out of the mining camps to nearby industrial areas was high. The miners split into several unions, with an affiliation to a political party. As a result, the socialist union (affiliated with the Social Democratic Party) competed with Catholic and Communist unions until 1933, when the Nazis took over all of them. After 1945 the socialists came to the fore.<ref name=\"Stefan Llafur Berger 2001 pp 5-40\"/>\n\n==Belgium==\nBy 1830 when iron and later steel became important in [[Wallonia]] the [[Belgian]] coal industry had long been established, and used [[steam engine]]s for pumping. The Belgian coalfield lay near the navigable [[River Meuse]], so coal was shipped downstream to the ports and cities of the [[Rhine]]-Meuse-[[Scheldt]] [[river delta|delta]]. The opening of the [[Saint-Quentin Canal]] in 1810 allowed coal to go by barge to [[Paris]]. The Belgian coalfield outcrops over most of its area, and the highly folded nature of the coal seams, part of the geological [[Rhenohercynian Zone]], meant that surface occurrences of the coal were very abundant. Deep mines were not required at first, so a large number of small operations sprang up. There was a complex legal system for concessions, and often multiple layers had different owners. Entrepreneurs started going deeper and deeper, thanks to the good pumping system. In 1790, the maximum depth of mines was {{convert|220|m|ft|sp=us}}. By 1856, the average depth in the [[Borinage]] was {{convert|361|m|ft|sp=us}}, and in 1866, {{convert|437|m|ft|sp=us}} and some pits had reached down {{convert|700|to|900|m|ft|-2|sp=us}}; one was {{convert|1065|m|ft|sp=us}} deep, probably the deepest coal mine in [[Europe]] at this time. Gas explosions were a serious problem, and Belgium had high coal miner fatality rates. By the late 19th century the seams were becoming exhausted, and the steel industry was importing some coal from the [[Ruhr]].<ref>Parker and Pounds (1957)</ref> Andr\u00e9 Dumont's discovery in 1900 of coal in the [[Campine]] basin, in the Belgian Province Limburg, prompted entrepreneurs from Li\u00e8ge to open coal mines, mainly producing coal for the steel industry. An announced reorganisation of the Belgian coal mines in 1965 resulted in strikes and a revolt which led to the death of two coal miners in 1966 at the Zwartberg mine. Coal was mined in the Li\u00e8ge basin until 1980, in the Southern Wallonian basin until 1984, and in the Campine basin until 1992.\n\n==Poland==\nThe first permanent coal mine in Poland was established in [[Szczakowa]] near [[Jaworzno]] in 1767. In 19th century development of iron, copper and lead mining and processing in southern Poland (notably in the [[Old-Polish Industrial Region]] and later in the region of [[Silesia]]) led to a quick development of coal mining. Among the most prominent deposits are those located in what are now the [[Upper Silesian Industrial Region]] and [[Rybnik Coal Area]] (formerly part of [[Prussia]]) and the [[Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie]] on the Russian side of the border.\n\nIn modern times coal is still considered a strategic resource for Poland's economy, as it covers roughly 65% of energetic needs. Before and after [[World War II]] Poland has been one of the major coal producers worldwide, usually listed among the five largest. However, after 1989 the coal production is in decline, with the overall production for 1994 reaching 132 million metric tons, 112 million metric tons in 1999 and 104 million metric tons in 2002.\n\n==Russia==\nFrom the 1860s large deposits in the Don Basin (\"Donbas\") in southern Russia supplied 87% of Russia's coal. It was used by railways and the iron and steel industry. After 1900 smaller deposits near Dombrovo, Zabaikal and Cheremkhovo in Siberia were opened. Small older mines south of Moscow also operated. Coal production was controlled by inefficient Russo-British syndicates, and there were shortages of workers, so the companies set up welfare systems for them. Their smallish output and the weak Russian railway system centered on the Ekaterininskaia (Krivoi Rog) Railway held back the growth of Russian heavy industry.<ref>A. M.

In 1939 the Urals produced only half the fuel needed by local industry. During the war the mines were expanded and over 700 factories were evacuated from the west, greatly increasing the demand for Ural coal. Prisoners from the Gulag were sent to the mines; up to a third of the workers were women. The miners were given much higher rations of food. Output doubled and the share of the region in the total national coal production rose from 8% to 22%.<ref>{{cite book|author=Walter Scott Dunn|title=The Soviet Economy and the Red Army, 1930-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dcAgT_2uiYgC&pg=PA38|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood |page=38|isbn=9780275948931}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989-91 militant coal miners in Russia and Ukraine were the mainstay of the revolutionary forced which finally overthrew the Communist system in 1991.<ref>Michael Burawoy and Pavel Michael, \"Russian Miners Bow to the Angel of History,\" ''Antipode'' (Jan 1995) 27#2 pp 115-136.</ref>\n\nToday the Donets Basin is the major coal-mining district in eastern Ukraine and adjacent portions of Russia.

India's export of coal increased, especially to Burma, Ceylon, and the Malay states.<ref>A.B.

The production reached a level of 29 mts. by 1942 and 30 mts. by 1946.\n\nAfter India became independent, the new government stressed the rapid growth of heavy industry. The National Coal Development Corporation was founded in 1956 (as a Government of India) undertaking. The founding of this body was major step in the development of an indigenous Indian coal sector. Especially important was the development of the vast [[Dhanbad]] coal-mining complex with such major operations as Tata Steel, BCCL, ECL and IISCO (Indian Iron And Steel Company), as well as the Indian School of Mines [[IIT (ISM) Dhanbad]] to train engineers, geologists and managers.<ref>Simon Commander, \"Industrialization and Sectoral Imbalance: Coal Mining and the Theory of Dualism in Colonial and Independent India,\" ''Journal of Peasant Studies'' (1981) 9#1 pp 86-96</ref>\n\n==Other countries==\n\nIn the 21st century, Indonesia has expanded its coal mining and by 2011 ranked #5 globally in production.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael S.

The worst single disaster in British coal mining history was at [[Senghenydd Colliery Disaster|Senghenydd]] in the [[South Wales coalfield]]. On the morning of 14 October 1913 an explosion and subsequent fire killed 436 men and boys. Only 72 bodies were recovered. It followed a series of many extensive [[Mining accident]]s in the late 19th century, such as [[The Oaks explosion]] of 1866 and the [[Hartley Colliery Disaster]] of 1862. Most of the explosions were caused by [[firedamp]] ignitions followed by coal dust explosions. At Hartley there was no explosion, but the miners entombed when the single shaft was blocked by a broken cast iron beam from the haulage engine.\nDeaths were mainly caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, known as [[afterdamp]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Mason | first = T. | first2 = Peter | last2 = Atkinson | title = The Hartley Pit Disaster | work = The Science and Art of Mining | publisher = Durham Mining Museum | year = 1911 | url = http://www.dmm.org.uk/archives/a_hart01.htm | accessdate = 3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Courri\u00e8res mine disaster]], Europe's worst mining accident, caused the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on 10 March 1906.

It became important in the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th and 20th centuries, when it was primarily used to power steam engines, heat buildings and generate electricity. Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today. Compared to [[wood fuel]]s, coal yields a higher amount of energy per mass and can often be obtained in areas where wood is not readily available. Though it was used historically as a domestic fuel, coal is now used mostly in industry, especially in [[smelting]] and [[alloy]] production as well as [[electricity generation]]. Large-scale [[coal mining]] developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]], and coal provided the main source of [[primary energy]] for industry and transportation in industrial areas from the 18th century to the 1950s. Coal remains an important energy source because of its low cost and abundance compared to other fuels, particularly for electricity generation.<ref name=\"Freese. 2004\">{{cite book|author=Barbara Freese|title=Coal: A Human History|url=https://archive.org/details/coalhumanhistory00free/page/137|year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=[https://archive.org/details/coalhumanhistory00free/page/137 137]|isbn=9780142000984|url-access=registration}}(stating that, \"[c]oal consumption doubled every decade between 1850 and 1890\" and that by turn of the century, \"coal was the unrivaled foundation of U.S. Power,\" providing \"71 percent of the nation's energy.\"</ref> Coal is also mined today on a large scale by [[open pit]] methods wherever the coal [[stratum|strata]] strike the surface or are relatively shallow. Britain developed the main techniques of underground coal mining from the late 18th century onward, with further progress being driven by 19th century and early 20th century progress.<ref name=\"Freese. 2004\"/> However, oil and gas were increasingly used as alternatives from the 1860s onward.\n\nBy the late 20th century, coal was, for the most part, replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by [[petroleum|oil]], [[natural gas]] or electricity produced from oil, gas, [[nuclear power]] or [[renewable energy]] sources. By 2010, coal produced over a fourth of the world's energy, and by 2050 it is expected to produce about a third.<ref>{{cite book|author=James G.

Typical methods for extraction included [[drift mining]] and [[bell pit]]s. As well as drift mines, small scale [[shaft mining]] was used. This took the form of a bell pit, the extraction working outward from a central shaft, or a technique called [[room and pillar]] in which 'rooms' of coal were extracted with pillars left to support the roofs. Both of these techniques however left considerable amount of usable coal behind.\n\nArcheological evidence in China indicates surface mining of coal and household usage after approximately 3490 BC.\n<ref>{{cite journal|author1=John Dodson|author2=Xiaoqiang|author3=Nan Sun|author4=Pia Atahan|author5=Xinying Zhou|author6=Hanbin Liu|author7=Keliang Zhao|author8=Songmei Hu|author9=Zemeng Yang|title=Use of coal in the Bronze Age in China|journal=The Holocene|date=March 3, 2014|volume=0959683614523155|doi=10.1177/0959683614523155|issue=5|pages=525\u2013530}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest reference to the use of coal in [[metalworking]] is found in the geological treatise ''On stones'' (Lap. 16) by the Greek scientist [[Theophrastus]] (c. 371\u2013287 BC):\n\n{{quote|Among the materials that are dug because they are useful, those known as coals are made of earth, and, once set on fire, they burn like [[charcoal]].

About 1631 the French made their fur trading post at the mouth of the Saint John River their main post in Acadia and started construction of a new fort. The main residence at the fort was designed with two 11 foot wide fireplaces which were stocked with wood and coal from up river.

International trade expanded exponentially when coal-fed steam engines were built for the [[railway]]s and [[steamship]]s during the [[Victorian era]]. Coal was cheaper and much more efficient than [[wood fuel]] in most steam engines. As central and [[Northern England]] contains an abundance of coal, many mines were situated in these areas as well as the [[South Wales coalfield]] and [[Scotland]]. The small-scale techniques were unsuited to the increasing demand, with extraction moving away from surface extraction to deep [[shaft mining]] as the Industrial Revolution progressed.<ref>Flinn and Stoker (1984)</ref>\n\nAs [[steamship]]s traveled overseas from the industrialized countries of Europe their need for coal served as trigger for coal mining to start at various locations across the globe.

The location of the [[coalfield]]s helped to make the prosperity of [[Lancashire]], of [[Yorkshire]], and of [[South Wales]]. The Yorkshire pits which supplied [[Sheffield]] were only about 300 feet deep. [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]] were the leading coal producers and they were the sites of the first deep pits. In much of Britain coal was worked from [[drift mine]]s, or scraped off when it outcropped on the surface. Small groups of part-time miners used shovels and primitive equipment.\n\nScottish miners had been bonded to their \"maisters\" by a 1606 Act \"Anent Coalyers and Salters\". A [[Colliers and Salters (Scotland) Act 1775]], recognised this to be \"a state of slavery and bondage\" and formally abolished it; this was made effective by a further law in 1799.<ref>{{cite web|title =Erskine May on Slavery in Britain (Vol. III, Chapter XI) | url =http://www.pdavis.nl/ErskineMay.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=James Barrowman, Mining Engineer |title =Slavery In The Coal-Mines Of Scotland |date= 14 September 1897 |publisher=Scottish Mining Website | url =http://www.scottishmining.co.uk/429.html | accessdate = 2017-11-02 }}</ref>\n\nBefore 1800 a great deal of coal was left in places as extraction was still primitive. As a result, in the deep [[Tyneside]] pits (300 to 1,000&nbsp;ft deep) only about 40 percent of the coal could be extracted. The use of wooden pit props to support the roof was an innovation first introduced about 1800. The critical factor was circulation of air and control of dangerous explosive gases. At first fires were burned at the bottom of the \"upcast\" shaft to create air currents and circulate air, but replaced by fans driven by steam engines. Protection for miners came with the invention of the [[Davy lamp]] and [[Geordie lamp]], where any [[firedamp]] (or [[methane]]) burnt harmlessly within the lamp. It was achieved by preventing the combustion spreading from the light chamber to the outside air with either metal gauze or fine tubes, but the illumination from such lamps was very poor. Great efforts were made to develop better safe lamps, such as the Mueseler produced in the Belgian pits near [[Li\u00e8ge]].\n\nCoal was so abundant in Britain that the supply could be stepped up to meet the rapidly rising demand. In 1700 the annual output of coal was just under 3 million tons. Between 1770 and 1780 the annual output of coal was some 6\u00bc million [[long ton]]s (or about the output of a week and a half in the 20th century). After 1790 output soared, reaching 16 million long tons by 1815 at the height of the [[Napoleonic War]]. By 1830 this had risen to over 30 million tons<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=A Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave|pages=109\u201310}}</ref> The miners, less affected by imported labour or machines than were the [[cotton mill]] workers, had begun to form [[trade union]]s and fight their grim battle for wages against the coal owners and royalty-lessees.<ref>J.

There was a high degree of equality in life style; combined with an evangelical religious style based on Methodism this led to an ideology of egalitarianism. They forged a \"community of solidarity\" - under the leadership of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|Miners Federation]]. The union supported first the Liberal Party, then after 1918 Labour, with some Communist Party activism at the fringes.<ref name=\"Stefan Llafur Berger 2001 pp 5-40\">Stefan Llafur Berger, \"Working-Class Culture and the Labour Movement in the South Wales and the Ruhr Coalfields, 1850-2000: A Comparison,\" ''Journal of Welsh Labour History/Cylchgrawn Hanes Llafur Cymru'' (2001) 8#2 pp 5-40.</ref>\n\n===Post-1900===\nThe need to maintain coal supplies (a primary energy source) had figured in both [[world war]]s.<ref name=\"Fine 1990\">Fine (1990)</ref> As well as energy supply, coal became a very political issue, due to conditions under which colliers worked and the way they were treated by colliery owners. Much of the 'old [[Left-wing politics|Left]]' of British politics can trace its origins to coal-mining areas, with the main labour union being the [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain]], founded in 1888. The MFGB claimed 600,000 members in 1908. (The MFGB later became the more centralised [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]]).\n\nAlthough other factors were involved, one cause of the [[UK General Strike of 1926]] was concerns colliers had over very dangerous working conditions, reduced pay and longer shifts.\n\nTechnological development throughout the 19th and 20th centuries helped both to improve the safety of colliers and the productive capacity of collieries they worked. In the late 20th century, improved integration of coal extraction with bulk industries such as electrical generation helped coal maintain its position despite the emergence of alternative energies supplies such as oil, natural gas and, from the late 1950s, [[nuclear power]] used for electricity. More recently coal has faced competition from renewable energy sources and bio-fuels.\n\nMost of the coal mines in Britain were purchased by the government in 1947 and put under the control of the [[National Coal Board]], with only the smaller mines left in private ownership. The NUM had campaigned for nationalisation for decades and, once it was achieved, sought to work with the NCB in managing the industry and discouraged strikes. Under the chairmanship of [[Alf Robens]], pit closures became widespread as coal's place in energy generation declined. The NUM leadership continued to resist calls for strike action, but an [[UK miners' strike (1969)|unofficial strike began in 1969]] after a conference pledge on the hours of surface-workers was not acted upon. This was a watershed moment that led to increased spending on the coal industry and a much slower rate of pit closures, as well as the election of more militant officials to the NUM leadership. Under the government of Ted Heath, an [[UK miners' strike (1972)|official strike in 1972]] won increased wages after the Wilberforce Commission. Less than two years later, Heath called a general election over another official strike, called after an overtime ban had led to a [[Three Day Week]] in Britain, and lost the election to the Labour Party. The wage demands were then met and spending on the industry continued to increase, including the establishment of the new [[Selby Coalfield]].\n\nBy the early 1980s, many pits were almost 100 years old and were considered uneconomic<ref>Margaret Thatcher, quoted in B.

[[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|The Miners' Strike of 1984]] failed to stop the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government's plans under [[Margaret Thatcher]] to shrink the industry, and a break-away [[Union of Democratic Mineworkers]] was founded by miners, mostly in the Midlands, who felt that the NUM had broken its own democratic rules in calling the strike. The [[National Coal Board]] (by then [[British Coal]]), was privatised by selling off a large number of pits to private concerns through the mid-1990s. Because of exhausted seams, high prices and cheap imports, the mining industry disappeared almost completely, despite the militant protests of some miners.<ref name=\"Fine 1990\"/><ref>Ben Curtis, \"A Tradition of Radicalism: The Politics of the South Wales Miners, 1964-1985,\" ''Labour History Review'' (2011) 76#1 pp 34-50</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, the [[South Wales Valleys]] last deep pit mine, [[Tower Colliery]] in Hirwaun, [[Rhondda Cynon Taff]] closed with the loss of 120 jobs.

At the same time [[steam engine]]s were phased out in railways and factories, and [[bituminous coal]] was used primarily for the generation of [[electricity]]. Employment in bituminous peaked at 705,000 men in 1923, falling to 140,000 by 1970 and 70,000 in 2003. UMW membership among active miners fell from 160,000 in 1980 to only 16,000 in 2005, as coal mining became more mechanized and non-union miners predominated in the new coal fields.\n\nIn the 1960s a series of mergers saw coal production shift from small, independent coal companies to large, more diversified firms. Several oil companies and electricity producers acquired coal companies or leased Federal coal reserves in the west of the United States. Concerns that competition in the coal industry could decline as a result of these changes were heightened by a sharp rise in coal prices in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Coal prices fell in the 1980s, partly in response to oil price movements, but primarily in response to the large increase in supply worldwide which was brought about by the earlier price surge. During this period, the industry in the U.S. was characterized by a move towards low-sulfur coal.<ref>[http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/retail.aspx?indid=108&chid=7 \"Coal Mining Industry Report\"] IBISWorld, 2009''</ref>\n\nIn 1987 Wyoming became the largest coal producing state. It uses strip mining exclusively. Wyoming's coal reserves total about 69.3 billion tons, or 14.2% of the U.S. coal reserve.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Manuel Lujan|author2=Harry M. Snyder|title=Surface Coal Mining Reclamation: 15 Years of Progress, 1977-1992, Statistical Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9skUgCfSEkC&pg=PA68|year=1992|publisher=DIANE |page=68|isbn=9780788142154}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, competition was intense in the US coal mining industry with some U.S. mines approaching the end of their useful life ([[mine closure]]).{{citation needed|date = August 2013}} Other coal-producing countries also stepped up production to win a share of traditional US export markets. Coal is used primarily to generate electricity, but the rapid drop in natural gas prices after 2008 created severe competition.\n\n==Australia==\nIn 1984 Australia surpassed the US as the world's largest coal exporter. One-third of Australia's coal exports were shipped from the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, where coal mining and transport had begun nearly two centuries earlier. Coal River was the first name given by British settlers to the Hunter River after coal was found there in 1795. In 1804 the Sydney-based administration established a permanent convict settlement near the mouth of the Hunter River to mine and load the coal, predetermining the town's future as a coal port by naming it Newcastle. Today, Newcastle, NSW, is the largest coal port in the world.\nNow the state of Queensland is Australia's top coal producer, with its Bowen Basin the main source of black coal, and plans by miners such as [[Gina Rinehart]] to open up the Galilee and Surat Basins to coal mining.\n\n==Canada==\nCanadian coal mining started in New Brunswick and also occurred in Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. The United States has been a major supplier for the industrial regions of [[Ontario]]. By 2000 about 19% of Canada's energy was supplied by coal, much of it imported from the U.S while Eastern Canadian ports import considerable coal from [[Venezuela]].\n\n===New Brunswick===\n\nThe first coal mining in North America began in New Brunswick, Canada in the early 1600s. Coal was found by French explorers and fur traders along the shores of Grand Lake where rivers and erosion had exposed the coal. Small amounts of coal were dug from surface deposits and tunnels dug into the coal seams, and this coal supplied Fort Saint Marie, built by the French about 1632 at the mouth of the Saint John River. The French sold coal to the British colony at Boston as early as 1639. Due to this earliest export of coal in North America, Grand Lake has been recognized as a Canadian Historic Site . Coal mining expanded after the British took control of the area in the mid 1700s and encouraged permanent settlements in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario by British Loyalists. Beginning in 1765, over 11,000 Loyalists settled in N.B., most along the lower 100 miles of the Saint John River and around Grand Lake. Approximately 200,000 tons of coal were dug at Grand Lake between 1639 and 1887 using surface collection, vertical shafts and the room and pillar system. By 1920, the use of draglines and other modern equipment made strip mining possible and the privately owned Grand Lake area mines produced over 200,000 tons per year. Most of this coal was used by the railroad and large businesses. By 1936, a coal burning electric power generating plant at Newcastle Creek was operating with two 33,000 volt lines going to Fredericton and one 66,000 volt line going to Marysville. By 1950, coal production at Grand Lake often reached 1 million tons per year. In 1969, all the privately owned Grand Lake area coal companies and approximately 1,000 employees were consolidated into one provincial government controlled company named N.B. Coal Ltd.. In 2009, the increasing availability of oil and environmental concerns with coal use caused the closing of the Grand Lake coal mines and New Brunswick's coal mining industry.\n\n=== Nova Scotia===\n[[File:Stellarton FoordSeam 077.JPG|thumb|left|Foord Coal Seam, [[Stellarton, Nova Scotia|Stellarton]]]]\nThe first coal mining in Nova Scotia began in the 18th century with small hand-dug mines close to the sea at [[Joggins, Nova Scotia]] and in the [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] area of [[Cape Breton Island]]. Large scale coal mining began in the late 1830s when the General Mining Association (GMA), a group of English mining investors, obtained a coal mining monopoly in Nova Scotia. They imported the latest in mining technology including steam water pumps and railways to develop large mines in the [[Stellarton, Nova Scotia|Stellarton]] area of [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia]], including the Foord Pit which by 1866 was the deepest coal mine in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/about/museumsite.aspx |title=\"History of the Site\", ''Nova Scotia Museum of Industry'' |access-date=2011-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317051008/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/about/museumsite.aspx |archive-date=2011-03-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Coal mining also developed in [[Springhill, Nova Scotia|Springhill]] and [[Joggins]] in [[Cumberland County, Nova Scotia]]. After the GMA monopoly expired, the largest and longest lasting mines developed at [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]] in [[Nova Scotia]]. Nova Scotia was the major supplier of Canadian coal until 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/novascotiaindustry/coalmining/default.aspx |title=\"Coal Mining\", ''Nova Scotia Museum of Industry'' |access-date=2011-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318064424/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/novascotiaindustry/coalmining/default.aspx |archive-date=2011-03-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At its peak in 1949 25,000 miners dug 17 million metric tons of coal from Nova Scotian mines. The miners, who lived in company towns, became politically active in [[left-wing politics]] during labour struggles for safety and fair wages. [[Westray Mine]] near Stellarton closed in 1992 after an explosion killed 26 miners. All the subsurface mines were closed by 2001, although some open pit coal mining continues near Stellarton. The [[Nova Scotia Museum of Industry]] at Stellarton explores the history of mining in the province from its location on the site of the Foord Pit.\n\n===Alberta===\nCoal was easy to find in what is now [[Drumheller]], [[Alberta]], Canada. The [[Atlas Coal Mine]] National Historic Site has turned this coalfield into a museum. This museum interprets how the [[Blackfoot]] and [[Cree]] knew about the \"black rock that burned.\" After many explorers reported coal in the area, a handful of ranchers and homesteaders dug out the coal for their homes. [[Sam Drumheller]] started the coal rush in this area when he bought the land from a local rancher, which he then sold to the [[Canadian National Railway]]. Sam Drumheller also registered a coal mine. However, before his mine opened [[Jesse Gouge]] and [[Garnet Coyle]] beat him to it by opening the [[Newcastle Mine]]. Once the railway was built thousands of people came to mine this area.\n\nBy the end of 1912, there were nine working coal mines, in [[Newcastle, Alberta|Newcastle]], Drumheller, [[Midland, Alberta|Midland]], [[Rosedale, Alberta|Rosedale]], and [[Wayne, Alberta|Wayne]]. In years to follow more mines sprang up: [[Nacmine, Alberta|Nacmine]], [[Cambria, Alberta|Cambria]], Willow Creek, Lehigh, and [[East Coulee, Alberta|East Coulee]]. The timing of the Drumheller mine industry was \"lucky\" according to the Atlas National Historical Site, in that the [[United Mine Workers]] union had recently won the right for better working conditions. As a result of union action, child labour laws were passed to prevent boys under 14 years old working underground.<ref>Robert McIntosh, ''Boys in the pits: Child labour in coal mines'' (McGill-Queen's Press-MQUP, 2000)</ref>\n\nMiners' camps in this area were called \"hell's holes\" because miners lived in tents and shacks. These camps were filled with drinking, gambling and watching fistfights as forms of recreation. With time, living conditions improved: little houses took the place of the tents, and more women joined the men and started families. With new activities such as hockey, baseball and theatre the camps were no longer \"hell's holes\" but became \"the wonder town of the west.\"\n\nBetween 1911 and 1979, 139 mines were registered in the [[Drumheller Valley]], of which only 34 were productive for many years. The beginning of the end for the Drumheller mining industry was the discovery of oil at [[Leduc No. 1]] in 1947, after which [[natural gas]] became the predominant fuel for heating homes in western Canada. As the demand for coal dropped, mines closed and communities suffered. Some communities, Willow Creek for example, completely vanished while others went from boomtowns to ghost towns.\n\nAtlas #4 Mine shipped its last load of coal in 1979, after which the Atlas Coal Mine National Historic Site has preserved the last of the Drumheller mines. Also nearby, [[East Coulee School Museum]] interprets the life of families in mine towns for its visitors.<ref>[http://www.atlascoalmine.ab.ca/] \"Atlas Coal Mine National Historical Site\"</ref>\n\n==France==\n[[Image:Courri\u00e8res 1906 LeJ.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'' the 1906 Courri\u00e8res mine disaster in France]]\n\nPierre-Francois Tubeuf laid the foundations of the modern industry in France, starting in 1770 in Languedoc.<ref>Gwynne Lewis, ''The Advent of Modern Capitalism in France, 1770-1840: The Contribution of Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Tubeuf'' (1993) [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198228950.003.0002 online]</ref> Labor unions emerged with an emphasis on the safety issue in the late 19th century.

Unions gain strength by setting up a system of worker elected mine-safety delegates. The national government encouraged the mine safety movement as a means of limiting strife in the sometimes turbulent coal fields.<ref>Donald Reid, \"The role of mine safety in the development of working-class consciousness and organization: The case of the Aubin Coal Basin, 1867-1914.\" ''French Historical Studies'' 12#1 (1981): 98-119.

In 1782 the [[Krupp]] family began operations near [[Essen]]. After 1815 entrepreneurs in the [[Ruhr Area]], which then became part of [[Prussia]] took advantage of the tariff zone ([[Zollverein]]) to open new mines and associated [[iron]] smelters. New railways were built by British engineers around 1850. Numerous small industrial centres sprang up, focused on [[ironworks]], using local coal. The iron and [[steel]] works typically bought mines, and erected [[coking]] ovens to supply their own requirements in [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] and gas. These integrated coal-iron firms (\"Huettenzechen\") became numerous after 1854; after 1900 they became mixed firms called \"Konzern.\"\n\nThe average output of a mine in 1850 was about 8,500 short tons; its employment about 64. By 1900, the average mine's output had risen to 280,000 and the employment to about 1,400.<ref>{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=Why was Britain first? The Industrial revolution in global context|url=https://www.academia.edu/1940258|work=Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref> Total [[Ruhr]] coal output rose from 2.0 million short tons in 1850 to 22 in 1880, 60 in 1900, and 114 in 1913, on the verge of war. In 1932 output was down to 73 million short tons, growing to 130 in 1940. Output peaked in 1957 (at 123 million), declining to 78 million short tons in 1974.<ref>Pounds (1952)</ref> At the end of 2010 five coal mines were producing in Germany. The last hard coal mine in Germany closed on december 21st 2018.\n\nThe miners in the Ruhr region were divided by ethnicity (with Germans and Poles) and religion (Protestants and Catholics). Mobility in and out of the mining camps to nearby industrial areas was high. The miners split into several unions, with an affiliation to a political party. As a result, the socialist union (affiliated with the Social Democratic Party) competed with Catholic and Communist unions until 1933, when the Nazis took over all of them. After 1945 the socialists came to the fore.<ref name=\"Stefan Llafur Berger 2001 pp 5-40\"/>\n\n==Belgium==\nBy 1830 when iron and later steel became important in [[Wallonia]] the [[Belgian]] coal industry had long been established, and used [[steam engine]]s for pumping. The Belgian coalfield lay near the navigable [[River Meuse]], so coal was shipped downstream to the ports and cities of the [[Rhine]]-Meuse-[[Scheldt]] [[river delta|delta]]. The opening of the [[Saint-Quentin Canal]] in 1810 allowed coal to go by barge to [[Paris]]. The Belgian coalfield outcrops over most of its area, and the highly folded nature of the coal seams, part of the geological [[Rhenohercynian Zone]], meant that surface occurrences of the coal were very abundant. Deep mines were not required at first, so a large number of small operations sprang up. There was a complex legal system for concessions, and often multiple layers had different owners. Entrepreneurs started going deeper and deeper, thanks to the good pumping system. In 1790, the maximum depth of mines was {{convert|220|m|ft|sp=us}}. By 1856, the average depth in the [[Borinage]] was {{convert|361|m|ft|sp=us}}, and in 1866, {{convert|437|m|ft|sp=us}} and some pits had reached down {{convert|700|to|900|m|ft|-2|sp=us}}; one was {{convert|1065|m|ft|sp=us}} deep, probably the deepest coal mine in [[Europe]] at this time. Gas explosions were a serious problem, and Belgium had high coal miner fatality rates. By the late 19th century the seams were becoming exhausted, and the steel industry was importing some coal from the [[Ruhr]].<ref>Parker and Pounds (1957)</ref> Andr\u00e9 Dumont's discovery in 1900 of coal in the [[Campine]] basin, in the Belgian Province Limburg, prompted entrepreneurs from Li\u00e8ge to open coal mines, mainly producing coal for the steel industry. An announced reorganisation of the Belgian coal mines in 1965 resulted in strikes and a revolt which led to the death of two coal miners in 1966 at the Zwartberg mine. Coal was mined in the Li\u00e8ge basin until 1980, in the Southern Wallonian basin until 1984, and in the Campine basin until 1992.\n\n==Poland==\nThe first permanent coal mine in Poland was established in [[Szczakowa]] near [[Jaworzno]] in 1767. In 19th century development of iron, copper and lead mining and processing in southern Poland (notably in the [[Old-Polish Industrial Region]] and later in the region of [[Silesia]]) led to a quick development of coal mining. Among the most prominent deposits are those located in what are now the [[Upper Silesian Industrial Region]] and [[Rybnik Coal Area]] (formerly part of [[Prussia]]) and the [[Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie]] on the Russian side of the border.\n\nIn modern times coal is still considered a strategic resource for Poland's economy, as it covers roughly 65% of energetic needs. Before and after [[World War II]] Poland has been one of the major coal producers worldwide, usually listed among the five largest. However, after 1989 the coal production is in decline, with the overall production for 1994 reaching 132 million metric tons, 112 million metric tons in 1999 and 104 million metric tons in 2002.\n\n==Russia==\nFrom the 1860s large deposits in the Don Basin (\"Donbas\") in southern Russia supplied 87% of Russia's coal. It was used by railways and the iron and steel industry. After 1900 smaller deposits near Dombrovo, Zabaikal and Cheremkhovo in Siberia were opened. Small older mines south of Moscow also operated. Coal production was controlled by inefficient Russo-British syndicates, and there were shortages of workers, so the companies set up welfare systems for them. Their smallish output and the weak Russian railway system centered on the Ekaterininskaia (Krivoi Rog) Railway held back the growth of Russian heavy industry.<ref>A. M.

In 1939 the Urals produced only half the fuel needed by local industry. During the war the mines were expanded and over 700 factories were evacuated from the west, greatly increasing the demand for Ural coal. Prisoners from the Gulag were sent to the mines; up to a third of the workers were women. The miners were given much higher rations of food. Output doubled and the share of the region in the total national coal production rose from 8% to 22%.<ref>{{cite book|author=Walter Scott Dunn|title=The Soviet Economy and the Red Army, 1930-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dcAgT_2uiYgC&pg=PA38|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood |page=38|isbn=9780275948931}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989-91 militant coal miners in Russia and Ukraine were the mainstay of the revolutionary forced which finally overthrew the Communist system in 1991.<ref>Michael Burawoy and Pavel Michael, \"Russian Miners Bow to the Angel of History,\" ''Antipode'' (Jan 1995) 27#2 pp 115-136.</ref>\n\nToday the Donets Basin is the major coal-mining district in eastern Ukraine and adjacent portions of Russia.

India's export of coal increased, especially to Burma, Ceylon, and the Malay states.<ref>A.B.

The production reached a level of 29 mts. by 1942 and 30 mts. by 1946.\n\nAfter India became independent, the new government stressed the rapid growth of heavy industry. The National Coal Development Corporation was founded in 1956 (as a Government of India) undertaking. The founding of this body was major step in the development of an indigenous Indian coal sector. Especially important was the development of the vast [[Dhanbad]] coal-mining complex with such major operations as Tata Steel, BCCL, ECL and IISCO (Indian Iron And Steel Company), as well as the Indian School of Mines [[IIT (ISM) Dhanbad]] to train engineers, geologists and managers.<ref>Simon Commander, \"Industrialization and Sectoral Imbalance: Coal Mining and the Theory of Dualism in Colonial and Independent India,\" ''Journal of Peasant Studies'' (1981) 9#1 pp 86-96</ref>\n\n==Other countries==\n\nIn the 21st century, Indonesia has expanded its coal mining and by 2011 ranked #5 globally in production.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael S.

It followed a series of many extensive [[Mining accident]]s in the late 19th century, such as [[The Oaks explosion]] of 1866 and the [[Hartley Colliery Disaster]] of 1862. Most of the explosions were caused by [[firedamp]] ignitions followed by coal dust explosions. At Hartley there was no explosion, but the miners entombed when the single shaft was blocked by a broken cast iron beam from the haulage engine.\nDeaths were mainly caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, known as [[afterdamp]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Mason | first = T. | first2 = Peter | last2 = Atkinson | title = The Hartley Pit Disaster | work = The Science and Art of Mining | publisher = Durham Mining Museum | year = 1911 | url = http://www.dmm.org.uk/archives/a_hart01.htm | accessdate = 3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Courri\u00e8res mine disaster]], Europe's worst mining accident, caused the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on 10 March 1906.

The literature of the late [[Victorian era]], including [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s first [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', has provided inspiration for story-makers who have fused these fictional worlds with the Ripper. \n\nThe Ripper makes appearances throughout the [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] genres and is internationally recognised as an evil character. The association of the Ripper with death and sex is particularly appealing to [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[rock music|rock]] musicians, who have incorporated the Ripper murders into their work.\n\n==Literature==\n[[File:The Curse Upon Mitre Square title page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of ''The Curse Upon Mitre Square'', 1888]]\nWorks of fiction inspired by the [[Whitechapel murders]] arose immediately after the atrocities were committed.

According to Matters, the doctor, given the pseudonym \"Dr Stanley\", committed the murders in revenge and then fled to Argentina. He expanded his ideas into a book, ''The Mystery of Jack the Ripper'', in 1929. The book was marketed as a serious study, but it contains obvious factual errors and the documents it supposedly uses as references have never been found.<ref>Woods and Baddeley, pp. 114\u2013115</ref> It inspired other works such as the theatre play ''Murder Most Foul'' and the film ''[[Jack the Ripper (1959 film)|Jack the Ripper]]''.<ref>Woods and Baddeley, pp. 160, 198</ref> Jonathan Goodman's 1984 book ''Who He?'' is also written as if it is a factual study, but the suspect described, \"Peter J Harpick\", is an invention whose name is an anagram of Jack the Ripper.<ref>Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 12\u201313</ref>\n\n[[Robert Bloch]]'s short story \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" (published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in 1943<ref name=w&b67/>) cast the Ripper as an eternal who must make [[human sacrifice]]s to extend his [[immortality]].<ref>Meikle, p. 110</ref> It was adapted for both radio (in ''Stay Tuned for Terror'') and television (as an episode of ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'' in 1961 written by [[Barr\u00e9 Lyndon]]).<ref name=w&b68>Woods and Baddeley, p. 68</ref> The science-fiction anthology ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' (1967) featured an unrelated Ripper story by Bloch, \"[[A Toy for Juliette]]\", and a sequel by [[Harlan Ellison]], \"[[The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World]]\", written with Bloch's permission.

Hitchcock decided to cast romantic lead [[Ivor Novello]] as the title character in his version of ''The Lodger'', with the consequence that the film company, [[Gainsborough Pictures]], insisted on a re-write to make Novello's character more sympathetic.<ref>Meikle, p. 50</ref> In a change from the original story, whether the lodger is the killer is no longer left ambivalent at the end. Instead, the lodger's strange behaviour arises because he is a vigilante, trying to catch the real killer.<ref>Meikle, pp. 50\u201351</ref> Novello remade the film in 1932 with a more dramatic ending, in which he throttles the killer, who is his demented brother, the \"Bosnian Murderer\".<ref>Meikle, pp. 53\u201354</ref> Novello played both roles, and [[Maurice Elvey]] directed.

It was one of the first horror pictures made by [[Hammer Film Productions]].<ref>Woods and Baddeley, p. 196</ref> [[Valentine Dyall]] plays the lodger, \"Dr. Fell\", who has escaped from a lunatic asylum where he has been incarcerated for 16 years since committing the [[Whitechapel murders]].<ref>Meikle, pp. 59\u201361</ref> Hammer released two Ripper-inspired films in 1971.

Baker]] and written by [[Jimmy Sangster]], is loosely based on [[Leonard Matters]]' theory that the Ripper was an avenging doctor.<ref>Meikle, pp. 75\u201379; Woods and Baddeley, p. 198</ref> It borrowed icons from previously successful horror films, such as ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958) and ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' (1957), by giving the Ripper a costume of a top hat and cape.<ref>Woods and Baddeley, p. 197</ref> The plot is a standard \"whodunit\" with the usual false leads and a denouement in which the least likely character, in this case \"Sir David Rogers\" played by [[Ewen Solon]], is revealed as the culprit.<ref>Meikle, pp. 76\u201377</ref> As in Matters' book, ''The Mystery of Jack the Ripper'', Solon's character murders prostitutes to avenge the death of his son. However, Matters used the ploy of the son dying from venereal disease, while the film has him committing suicide on learning his lover is a prostitute.<ref>Meikle, p. 79</ref> In a reversal of this formula, the German film ''[[The Monster of London City|Das Ungeheuer von London City]]'' (1964), released as ''The Monster of London City'' in 1967, casts the son as the villain with the father as the victim of syphilis.<ref>Meikle, pp. 86\u201387</ref>\n\n''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (''Die B\u00fcchse der Pandora'') is a 1929 German silent film directed by [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst]] based on [[Frank Wedekind]]'s play about a woman, Lulu, played by [[Louise Brooks]].

''A Study in Terror'', and its companion novel written by [[Ellery Queen]],<ref>Meikle, p. 99; Woods and Baddeley, p. 150</ref> feature the often insane family of the Duke of Shires, with a motive provided by one of his son's becoming enamoured of a prostitute.<ref>Meikle, pp. 92\u201399</ref> ''Murder by Decree'', starring [[Christopher Plummer]] as Sherlock Holmes and [[James Mason]] as Watson, follows the [[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution|masonic/royal conspiracy]] plotline popularised by [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]], in which a royal physician is the murderer. Coincidentally, in both movies, character actor [[Frank Finlay]] plays [[Inspector Lestrade]].<ref>Meikle, p. 150</ref> Part of the conspiracy plotline was followed in the television miniseries ''[[Jack the Ripper (1988 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (1988) starring [[Michael Caine]] as Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]]. In the 1997 film ''The Ripper'', [[Samuel West]] starred as [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Eddy]], who was revealed as the Ripper, and [[Love Lies Bleeding (1999 film)]] featured [[Paul Rhys]], [[Emily Raymond]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] in another film. In 2001, the [[Hughes Brothers]] made the comic book ''[[From Hell]]'' into a [[From Hell (film)|film of the same name]] starring [[Johnny Depp]] as Abberline. The film again sticks to the Knight storyline, though Depp's character differs significantly from Caine's heroic Abberline and exhibits aspects of both Sherlock Holmes (deductive powers, drug addiction) and [[Robert Lees (psychic)|Robert Lees]] (psychic ability, foresight).\n\nPeter Barnes' stage play ''[[The Ruling Class (play)|The Ruling Class]]'' (1968) and [[The Ruling Class (film)|its film adaptation]] (1972) are satires on the British aristocracy that link the Ripper to the British upper class.<ref name=m131/> Jack Gurney, the mentally ill 14th Earl of Gurney (played in the film version by [[Peter O'Toole]]), spends part of the plot believing himself to be Jack the Ripper, and performs a pair of Ripper murders.<ref name=m131/> The black comedy ''Deadly Advice'' (1994) features [[Jane Horrocks]] as a serial killer who imagines that she is given advice by the incarnations of famous murderers.

The idea of the Ripper as a supernatural entity is used again in the [[Sleepy Hollow (season 3)|third season]] of the television series ''[[Sleepy Hollow (TV series)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', with the 'killer' in this case being a knife that drives its wielder to act on their darker impulses as it absorbs the blood of its victims; it is defeated when it is tricked into stabbing someone with [[malaria]], the infection tainting the blood and thus weakening the blade.\n\n''[[Jack the Ripper (1973 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (1973) by [[Elwyn Jones (writer)|Elwyn Jones]] and [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] linked with the police drama ''[[Z-Cars]]''.

The two meet and the real Jack travels into Gary's present day in 1999, whereby he escapes into the street and is run over by a bus, thereby explaining the sudden end to the murders. ''[[Ripper Street]]'' is a 2012 British television dramatic series set just subsequent to the murders, with the first episode seeing series protagonist [[Edmund Reid]] resolving to move on from obsession over the victims after a new case; at the end of the first season, protagonist Homer Jackson is temporarily framed as the Ripper, but is able to clear his name. In the ''[[Wynonna Earp (TV series)|Wynonna Earp]]'' episode \"Two-Faced Jack\" (2016), Jack the Ripper is known by the alias \"Jack of Knives\". He was killed by [[Wyatt Earp]], but resurrects as a demon when an Earp heir comes of age due to a demon's curse placed upon the family.

Hitchcock decided to cast romantic lead [[Ivor Novello]] as the title character in his version of ''The Lodger'', with the consequence that the film company, [[Gainsborough Pictures]], insisted on a re-write to make Novello's character more sympathetic.<ref>Meikle, p. 50</ref> In a change from the original story, whether the lodger is the killer is no longer left ambivalent at the end. Instead, the lodger's strange behaviour arises because he is a vigilante, trying to catch the real killer.<ref>Meikle, pp. 50\u201351</ref> Novello remade the film in 1932 with a more dramatic ending, in which he throttles the killer, who is his demented brother, the \"Bosnian Murderer\".<ref>Meikle, pp. 53\u201354</ref> Novello played both roles, and [[Maurice Elvey]] directed.

''A Study in Terror'', and its companion novel written by [[Ellery Queen]],<ref>Meikle, p. 99; Woods and Baddeley, p. 150</ref> feature the often insane family of the Duke of Shires, with a motive provided by one of his son's becoming enamoured of a prostitute.<ref>Meikle, pp. 92\u201399</ref> ''Murder by Decree'', starring [[Christopher Plummer]] as Sherlock Holmes and [[James Mason]] as Watson, follows the [[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution|masonic/royal conspiracy]] plotline popularised by [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]], in which a royal physician is the murderer. Coincidentally, in both movies, character actor [[Frank Finlay]] plays [[Inspector Lestrade]].<ref>Meikle, p. 150</ref> Part of the conspiracy plotline was followed in the television miniseries ''[[Jack the Ripper (1988 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (1988) starring [[Michael Caine]] as Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]]. In the 1997 film ''The Ripper'', [[Samuel West]] starred as [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Eddy]], who was revealed as the Ripper, and [[Love Lies Bleeding (1999 film)]] featured [[Paul Rhys]], [[Emily Raymond]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] in another film. In 2001, the [[Hughes Brothers]] made the comic book ''[[From Hell]]'' into a [[From Hell (film)|film of the same name]] starring [[Johnny Depp]] as Abberline. The film again sticks to the Knight storyline, though Depp's character differs significantly from Caine's heroic Abberline and exhibits aspects of both Sherlock Holmes (deductive powers, drug addiction) and [[Robert Lees (psychic)|Robert Lees]] (psychic ability, foresight).\n\nPeter Barnes' stage play ''[[The Ruling Class (play)|The Ruling Class]]'' (1968) and [[The Ruling Class (film)|its film adaptation]] (1972) are satires on the British aristocracy that link the Ripper to the British upper class.<ref name=m131/> Jack Gurney, the mentally ill 14th Earl of Gurney (played in the film version by [[Peter O'Toole]]), spends part of the plot believing himself to be Jack the Ripper, and performs a pair of Ripper murders.<ref name=m131/> The black comedy ''Deadly Advice'' (1994) features [[Jane Horrocks]] as a serial killer who imagines that she is given advice by the incarnations of famous murderers.

The idea of the Ripper as a supernatural entity is used again in the [[Sleepy Hollow (season 3)|third season]] of the television series ''[[Sleepy Hollow (TV series)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', with the 'killer' in this case being a knife that drives its wielder to act on their darker impulses as it absorbs the blood of its victims; it is defeated when it is tricked into stabbing someone with [[malaria]], the infection tainting the blood and thus weakening the blade.\n\n''[[Jack the Ripper (1973 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (1973) by [[Elwyn Jones (writer)|Elwyn Jones]] and [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] linked with the police drama ''[[Z-Cars]]''.

He was the youngest of nine children. Strassmann grew up in [[Dusseldorf]]. Strassmann developed an interest in chemistry at a young age and conducted chemistry experiments in his parents' home. His family was of modest means, and his father died at a young age, making the family's financial problems worse. Financial considerations limited Strassmann's initial choices of where to pursue his [[higher education]] and what subjects they should be.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/><ref name=\"Friedlander\"/> \n\nStrassmann began his formal chemistry studies in 1920 at the [[Technical University of Hannover]], supporting himself financially by working as a tutor for other students. He received a diploma in [[chemical engineering]] in 1924, and his [[Ph.D.|doctorate]] in [[physical chemistry]] in 1929.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/><ref name=\"Friedlander\"/> His doctoral research was on the solubility and reactivity of iodine in [[carbonic acid]] in the gas phase.

When his scholarship expired in September 1932, Strassmann continued to work as a research student in Hahn's laboratory, without a [[stipend]] but also without having to pay tuition.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/>\n\nOn 20 July 1937 Strassmann married Maria Strassmann (n\u00e9e Heckter), also a chemist. As a married couple, they had a son, Martin. Strassmann was a [[self-taught]] [[violinist]]. He met Maria Heckter Strassmann through a group of young musicians that they both belonged to.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/>\n\nHis wife Maria died of cancer in 1956. In 1959, Strassmann married [[journalist]] Irmgard Hartmann.

He also elucidated methods for the dating the age of minerals based on the half-life of radioactive elements and the enrichment of decay products. Strassmann and [[Ernst Walling]] developed the rubidium-strontium method of [[radiometric dating]] in 1936 and 1937, and Strassmann continued this work in 1942 and 1943.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/> \n\nOn 15 February 1944 and again on 24 March 1944, as part of the [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II]], the Institute suffered severe bombing damage.

Mattauch was appointed director of the Institute. Mattauch developed [[tuberculosis]], and, in his absence, Strassman became acting director in 1948. As of 1949, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute was renamed the [[Max Planck Institute for Chemistry]], and moved from Tailfingen to [[Mainz]], [[Germany]].\n\nIn 1950 Strassmann became the official director of the Institute.<ref name=\"Chronik\">{{cite web |title=Chronik des Kaiser-Wilhelm- / Max-Planck-Instituts f\u00fcr Chemie |url=https://www.mpic.de/3557710/Chronik_kompl_kl.pdf |website=Max-Planck-Instituts f\u00fcr Chemie |accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Palme\">{{cite journal |last1=Palme |first1=Herbert |title=Cosmochemistry along the Rhine |journal=Geochemical Perspectives |date=2018 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=4-10 |url=http://www.geochemicalperspectives.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/v7n1.pdf}}</ref> After Mattauch returned to the institute in 1951, there was considerable conflict over the allocation of resources to their respective departments.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/>\n\n===Renewed research===\nIn 1953, Strassmann gave up the directorship, choosing instead to focus on his research and scholarship at the University of Mainz. He succeeded in building up the department's capabilities, and he worked directly with students. Strassmann began these undertakings at the University of Mainz with a few scattered rooms and very little money.

He was the youngest of nine children. Strassmann grew up in [[Dusseldorf]]. Strassmann developed an interest in chemistry at a young age and conducted chemistry experiments in his parents' home. His family was of modest means, and his father died at a young age, making the family's financial problems worse. Financial considerations limited Strassmann's initial choices of where to pursue his [[higher education]] and what subjects they should be.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/><ref name=\"Friedlander\"/> \n\nStrassmann began his formal chemistry studies in 1920 at the [[Technical University of Hannover]], supporting himself financially by working as a tutor for other students. He received a diploma in [[chemical engineering]] in 1924, and his [[Ph.D.|doctorate]] in [[physical chemistry]] in 1929.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/><ref name=\"Friedlander\"/> His doctoral research was on the solubility and reactivity of iodine in [[carbonic acid]] in the gas phase.

When his scholarship expired in September 1932, Strassmann continued to work as a research student in Hahn's laboratory, without a [[stipend]] but also without having to pay tuition.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/>\n\nOn 20 July 1937 Strassmann married Maria Strassmann (n\u00e9e Heckter), also a chemist. As a married couple, they had a son, Martin. Strassmann was a [[self-taught]] [[violinist]]. He met Maria Heckter Strassmann through a group of young musicians that they both belonged to.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/>\n\nHis wife Maria died of cancer in 1956. In 1959, Strassmann married [[journalist]] Irmgard Hartmann.

On leaving school he originally trained as an [[engineer]], but then entered [[Durham University]] to study [[medicine]]. In 1877 he entered the [[London Hospital]] Medical College, where he was noted as a successful student and a good [[association football|football]] player. In 1879 Openshaw won the Outpatient Dresser's Prize of \u00a315, awarded to the best dresser of wounds in the Outpatients Department.<ref name=\"bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk\">[http://www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk/aboutus/master_surgeon.asp : Master surgeon, photographer, cyclist and angler<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk</ref>\n \nHaving successfully completed his medical studies, Openshaw was awarded an [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MBBS]] (Durham) and, in 1883, was appointed a [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|Member of the Royal College of Surgeons]]. Openshaw took the English Conjoint Diploma in 1884, and in 1886 became a [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons]]. Among Openshaw's other qualifications at that time were Licentiate of the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|Society of Apothecaries]] and [[Master of Surgery]] (Durham).<ref name=\"bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk\">[http://www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk/aboutus/master_surgeon.asp : Master surgeon, photographer, cyclist and angler<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk</ref>\n\nFollowing his Fellowship, he was appointed Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy at the London Hospital Medical College in 1886, and, after his subsequent appointment as Curator of the Pathology Museum in 1887, he extended and catalogued the Museum's collection of [[pathological]] specimens, thereby creating an important research facility for the College's medical students. Openshaw's medical career continued to develop at the London Hospital with his appointment as assistant surgeon in 1890 and surgeon in 1899.\n\nHe founded the [[Orthopaedic]] Department at the London Hospital, and became a consulting surgeon in 1926.<ref name=Lancet>'The Lancet' obituary, 23 November 1929 pg 1117</ref>\n\n==Jack the Ripper==\n{{Ripper letters}}{{wikisource|Openshaw letter}}\n[[File:OpenshawEnvelope.jpg|thumb|left|Envelope containing the 'Openshaw Letter']]\n[[File:openshaw letter.jpg|thumb|left|Copy of the 'Openshaw Letter'.]]\nWhen a kidney, purportedly from [[Jack the Ripper]] victim [[Catherine Eddowes]], was posted to [[George Lusk]], Chairman of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]], together with the [[From Hell letter|''From Hell'' letter]], Lusk was persuaded by his fellow Committee members to take them to Dr Frederick Wiles, who had a surgery nearby on the Mile End Road.\n\nWiles was out, so his assistant, F S Reed, examined the contents of the box and took the kidney to Openshaw at the nearby London Hospital. Openshaw believed that the kidney was from the left side of a human body.\n\nAs Openshaw was frequently mentioned in press reports at the time in connection with the kidney and ''From Hell'' letter, his name became known widely among the general public. On 29 October 1888 he received a letter through the post addressed to 'Dr Openshaw, Pathological curator, London Hospital, [[Whitechapel]]' and was postmarked 'LONDON E', 'OC29 88'. The text of the letter reads as follows:\n\n''Old boss you was rite it was the left kidny i was goin to hoperate agin close to your ospitle just as i was going to dror mi nife along of er bloomin throte them cusses of coppers spoilt the game but i guess i wil be on the job soon and will send you another bit of innerds''\n\n''Jack the Ripper''\n\n''O have you seen the devle''<br />\n''with his mikerscope and scalpul'' <br />\n''a-lookin at a kidney'' <br />\n''with a slide cocked up.''\n\nThis letter has become known as the '' 'Openshaw Letter' ''.<ref>[http://www.casebook.org/ripper_letters/ [[Casebook: Jack the Ripper]] - Ripper Letters<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.casebook.org</ref>  A copy of the letter is on display with other Ripper items in the [[Royal London Hospital]]'s museum in Whitechapel.<ref name=\"bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk\">[http://www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk/aboutus/master_surgeon.asp : Master surgeon, photographer, cyclist and angler<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk</ref>\n\nThe letter was also used by author [[Patricia Cornwell]] to try to substantiate her claim that [[Walter Sickert]] was the Ripper.<ref>Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed; Patricia Cornwell (Little, Brown 2002)</ref> She claims that  the paper used for the Openshaw Letter came from the same manufacturers as paper used by Sickert.

Mitochondrial DNA, however, is not a definitive test of identity and the sequence found by Cornwell's team of experts could be from one of over 400,000 individuals.<ref>The Complete Jack the Ripper; Donald Rumbelow (Penguin 2004)</ref>\n\n==Military service==\nAs a youth Openshaw became a member of the [[British Army|British Army's]] volunteer force (the then equivalent of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]), eventually being appointed [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in the [[Lincolnshire Yeomanry]]. Having been appointed surgeon to the Volunteer Medical Staff Corps in 1888, when the [[Second Boer War]] broke out in [[South Africa]] in October 1899, Openshaw left his duties at the London Hospital and went there as surgeon to the Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital. Openshaw was taken prisoner by the [[Boer]]s, but was released after two weeks of confinement during an exchange of prisoners. He was subsequently appointed Principal Medical Officer at the Number Three Medical School Hospital in [[Pretoria]]. For his services during the Second Boer War Openshaw was awarded the Companion of the Most Distinguished [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG) by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].<ref name=Lancet/>\n\nAs Openshaw was 58 years old when the [[First World War]] broke out in 1914, he was considered too old to serve abroad in the front line. Nevertheless, he was determined to contribute to the war effort and therefore served with the rank of [[colonel]] in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] (Territorial Force) as a consulting surgeon based in the United Kingdom. Openshaw later received the [[Territorial Decoration]] (TD) for his services.\n\nHe was elected surgeon to the King Edward VII Hospital, and later, as an acknowledged expert in [[orthopaedic surgery]], he was instrumental in establishing the Queen Mary Convalescent Auxiliary Hospital for the Limbless at [[Roehampton]], where he oversaw the development of effective artificial limbs for the thousands of men who had become amputees because of injuries sustained during the war. In 1917 he was awarded the Companion of the Most Honourable [[Order of the Bath]] (CB) for this important work.<ref name=\"bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk\"/>\n\n==Interests==\nOpenshaw had numerous interests outside of medicine. For example, he was the Master of four [[guilds]], the Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights, the Worshipful Company of Barber-Surgeons, the Worshipful Company of Glovers and the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights. He was also an enthusiastic [[Freemason]] and was a founder member of the London Hospital Lodge, and was also a founder of [[Masonic lodge|lodges]] at his old [[grammar school]] and [[university]]. In addition, he was a Fellow of the Old Time Cyclists Club, President of the Red Spinner Angling Society, President of the Association of Lancastrians in London and an early Master of the Lancastrian Lodge.\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:openshaw1929.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Openshaw late in life]]\nAlthough he wrote no books or medical treatises, Openshaw was the joint editor of the Catalogue of the Pathological Collection at the London Hospital. From 1916 to 1924 he served on the Council of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]]. In addition, he was consulting surgeon to the [[Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital]], the Poplar Hospital for Accidents, and the [[Cottage hospital|Cottage Hospitals]] of [[Tilbury]], [[Sidcup]] and [[Woolwich]]. He was surgeon to the Royal Surgical Aid Society.<ref name=Lancet/>\n\nOpenshaw had a son and daughter with his wife, Selina Gertrude Pratt, the daughter of William Pratt of Buern Abbey in [[Oxford]], whom he met at the London Hospital where she had trained as a [[nurse]].

On leaving school he originally trained as an [[engineer]], but then entered [[Durham University]] to study [[medicine]]. In 1877 he entered the [[London Hospital]] Medical College, where he was noted as a successful student and a good [[association football|football]] player. In 1879 Openshaw won the Outpatient Dresser's Prize of \u00a315, awarded to the best dresser of wounds in the Outpatients Department.<ref name=\"bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk\">[http://www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk/aboutus/master_surgeon.asp : Master surgeon, photographer, cyclist and angler<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk</ref>\n \nHaving successfully completed his medical studies, Openshaw was awarded an [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MBBS]] (Durham) and, in 1883, was appointed a [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|Member of the Royal College of Surgeons]]. Openshaw took the English Conjoint Diploma in 1884, and in 1886 became a [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons]]. Among Openshaw's other qualifications at that time were Licentiate of the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|Society of Apothecaries]] and [[Master of Surgery]] (Durham).<ref name=\"bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk\">[http://www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk/aboutus/master_surgeon.asp : Master surgeon, photographer, cyclist and angler<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk</ref>\n\nFollowing his Fellowship, he was appointed Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy at the London Hospital Medical College in 1886, and, after his subsequent appointment as Curator of the Pathology Museum in 1887, he extended and catalogued the Museum's collection of [[pathological]] specimens, thereby creating an important research facility for the College's medical students. Openshaw's medical career continued to develop at the London Hospital with his appointment as assistant surgeon in 1890 and surgeon in 1899.\n\nHe founded the [[Orthopaedic]] Department at the London Hospital, and became a consulting surgeon in 1926.<ref name=Lancet>'The Lancet' obituary, 23 November 1929 pg 1117</ref>\n\n==Jack the Ripper==\n{{Ripper letters}}{{wikisource|Openshaw letter}}\n[[File:OpenshawEnvelope.jpg|thumb|left|Envelope containing the 'Openshaw Letter']]\n[[File:openshaw letter.jpg|thumb|left|Copy of the 'Openshaw Letter'.]]\nWhen a kidney, purportedly from [[Jack the Ripper]] victim [[Catherine Eddowes]], was posted to [[George Lusk]], Chairman of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]], together with the [[From Hell letter|''From Hell'' letter]], Lusk was persuaded by his fellow Committee members to take them to Dr Frederick Wiles, who had a surgery nearby on the Mile End Road.\n\nWiles was out, so his assistant, F S Reed, examined the contents of the box and took the kidney to Openshaw at the nearby London Hospital. Openshaw believed that the kidney was from the left side of a human body.\n\nAs Openshaw was frequently mentioned in press reports at the time in connection with the kidney and ''From Hell'' letter, his name became known widely among the general public. On 29 October 1888 he received a letter through the post addressed to 'Dr Openshaw, Pathological curator, London Hospital, [[Whitechapel]]' and was postmarked 'LONDON E', 'OC29 88'. The text of the letter reads as follows:\n\n''Old boss you was rite it was the left kidny i was goin to hoperate agin close to your ospitle just as i was going to dror mi nife along of er bloomin throte them cusses of coppers spoilt the game but i guess i wil be on the job soon and will send you another bit of innerds''\n\n''Jack the Ripper''\n\n''O have you seen the devle''<br />\n''with his mikerscope and scalpul'' <br />\n''a-lookin at a kidney'' <br />\n''with a slide cocked up.''\n\nThis letter has become known as the '' 'Openshaw Letter' ''.<ref>[http://www.casebook.org/ripper_letters/ [[Casebook: Jack the Ripper]] - Ripper Letters<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.casebook.org</ref>  A copy of the letter is on display with other Ripper items in the [[Royal London Hospital]]'s museum in Whitechapel.<ref name=\"bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk\">[http://www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk/aboutus/master_surgeon.asp : Master surgeon, photographer, cyclist and angler<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk</ref>\n\nThe letter was also used by author [[Patricia Cornwell]] to try to substantiate her claim that [[Walter Sickert]] was the Ripper.<ref>Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed; Patricia Cornwell (Little, Brown 2002)</ref> She claims that  the paper used for the Openshaw Letter came from the same manufacturers as paper used by Sickert.

Having been appointed surgeon to the Volunteer Medical Staff Corps in 1888, when the [[Second Boer War]] broke out in [[South Africa]] in October 1899, Openshaw left his duties at the London Hospital and went there as surgeon to the Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital. Openshaw was taken prisoner by the [[Boer]]s, but was released after two weeks of confinement during an exchange of prisoners. He was subsequently appointed Principal Medical Officer at the Number Three Medical School Hospital in [[Pretoria]]. For his services during the Second Boer War Openshaw was awarded the Companion of the Most Distinguished [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG) by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].<ref name=Lancet/>\n\nAs Openshaw was 58 years old when the [[First World War]] broke out in 1914, he was considered too old to serve abroad in the front line. Nevertheless, he was determined to contribute to the war effort and therefore served with the rank of [[colonel]] in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] (Territorial Force) as a consulting surgeon based in the United Kingdom. Openshaw later received the [[Territorial Decoration]] (TD) for his services.\n\nHe was elected surgeon to the King Edward VII Hospital, and later, as an acknowledged expert in [[orthopaedic surgery]], he was instrumental in establishing the Queen Mary Convalescent Auxiliary Hospital for the Limbless at [[Roehampton]], where he oversaw the development of effective artificial limbs for the thousands of men who had become amputees because of injuries sustained during the war. In 1917 he was awarded the Companion of the Most Honourable [[Order of the Bath]] (CB) for this important work.<ref name=\"bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk\"/>\n\n==Interests==\nOpenshaw had numerous interests outside of medicine. For example, he was the Master of four [[guilds]], the Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights, the Worshipful Company of Barber-Surgeons, the Worshipful Company of Glovers and the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights. He was also an enthusiastic [[Freemason]] and was a founder member of the London Hospital Lodge, and was also a founder of [[Masonic lodge|lodges]] at his old [[grammar school]] and [[university]]. In addition, he was a Fellow of the Old Time Cyclists Club, President of the Red Spinner Angling Society, President of the Association of Lancastrians in London and an early Master of the Lancastrian Lodge.\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:openshaw1929.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Openshaw late in life]]\nAlthough he wrote no books or medical treatises, Openshaw was the joint editor of the Catalogue of the Pathological Collection at the London Hospital. From 1916 to 1924 he served on the Council of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]]. In addition, he was consulting surgeon to the [[Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital]], the Poplar Hospital for Accidents, and the [[Cottage hospital|Cottage Hospitals]] of [[Tilbury]], [[Sidcup]] and [[Woolwich]]. He was surgeon to the Royal Surgical Aid Society.<ref name=Lancet/>\n\nOpenshaw had a son and daughter with his wife, Selina Gertrude Pratt, the daughter of William Pratt of Buern Abbey in [[Oxford]], whom he met at the London Hospital where she had trained as a [[nurse]]. They married in 1890. His son, [[Major]] L.P. Openshaw, served in the [[Royal Air Force]] as a [[Aviator|pilot]] and was killed in a mid-air collision during an [[air show]] in [[Bournemouth]] in June 1927.<ref>[http://daveg4otu.tripod.com/airfields/ben.html Bournemouth, Early Airfields, Ensbury Park.<!-- bot-generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527080506/http://daveg4otu.tripod.com/airfields/ben.html |date=27 May 2010 }} at daveg4otu.tripod.com</ref>\n\nA few months after his wife's death in 1929 Openshaw developed [[diabetes]] and died of [[pneumonia]] in a nursing home aged 73.\n\n==Openshaw Archive==\n[[File:openshaw-medals.jpg|thumb|Openshaw's Companion of the Bath and his Freemasonry medals on display at the Royal London Hospital]]\nOpenshaw's photographs from the [[Second Boer War]], his medals and certificates were donated to the [[Royal London Hospital]] Archives and Museum in 2004 by John Jenner, his grandson.

The group used to have a very hierarchical organization with a leading figure at the top, delegating into three substructures: the logistical, military and political sections. Reports from Spanish and French police pointed towards significant changes in ETA's structures in its later years. ETA divided the three substructures into a total of eleven. The change was a response to captures, and possible infiltration, by the different law enforcement agencies. ETA's intention was to disperse its members and reduce the effects of detentions.\n\nThe leading committee comprised 7 to 11 individuals, and ETA's internal documentation referred to it as Zuba, an abbreviation of ''Zuzendaritza Batzordea'' (directorial committee). There was another committee named ''Zuba-hitu'' that functioned as an advisory committee. The eleven different substructures were: logistics, politics, international relations with fraternal organisations, military operations, reserves, prisoner support, expropriation, information, recruitment, negotiation, and treasury.<ref>[http://www.elcorreodigital.com/vizcaya/pg060323/actualidad/politica/200603/23/ECD_eta_funcionamiento.html POL\u00cdTICA \u2013 ETA ha modificado su estructura interna por motivos de seguridad].

In the past there was also the figure of the deportees, expelled by the French government to remote countries where they lived freely. ETA's internal bulletin was named ''[[Zutabe]]'' (\"Column\"), replacing the earlier one (1962) ''[[Zutik (publication)|Zutik]]'' (\"Standing\").\n\nETA also promoted the ''[[kale borroka]]'' (\"street fight\"), that is, violent acts against public transportation, political parties' offices or cultural buildings, destruction of private property of politicians, police, military, bank offices, journalists, council members, and anyone voicing criticism against ETA. Tactics included threats, graffiti of political mottoes, and rioting, usually using [[Molotov cocktails]]. These groups were mostly made up of young people, who were directed through youth organisations (such as [[Jarrai]], [[Haika]] and [[Segi (organization)|Segi]]).

The bill passed the Cortes with a 304 to 16 vote.<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/2002/06/05/espana/1153258.html El Congreso aprueba la Ley de Partidos con el 95% de los votos], ''El Mundo'', 5 June 2002.</ref> Many within the Basque nationalistic movement strongly disputed the Law, which they considered too draconian or even unconstitutional; alleging that any party could be made illegal almost by choice, simply for not clearly stating their opposition to an attack.\n\nDefenders of the law argued that the ''Ley de Partidos'' did not necessarily require responses to individual acts of violence, but rather a declaration of principles explicitly rejecting violence as a means of achieving political goals. Defenders also argued that the ban of a political party is subject to judicial process, with all the guarantees of the State of Law. Batasuna had failed to produce such a statement. {{As of|2008|alt=As of February 2008}} other political parties linked to organizations such as ''[[Communist Party of Spain (Reconstituted)|Partido Comunista de Espa\u00f1a (reconstituido)]]'' have also been declared illegal, and [[Acci\u00f3n Nacionalista Vasca]] and [[Communist Party of the Basque Lands]] (EHAK/PCTV, ''Euskal Herrialdeetako Alderdi Komunista/Partido Comunista de las Tierras Vascas'') were declared illegal in September 2008.\n\nA new party called [[Aukera Guztiak]] ''(All the Options)'' was formed expressly for the elections to the [[Basque Parliament]] of April 2005. Its supporters claimed no heritage from Batasuna, asserting that their aim was to allow Basque citizens to freely express their political ideas, even those of independence. On the matter of political violence, Aukera Guztiak stated their right not to condemn some kinds of violence more than others if they did not see fit (in this regard, the [[Basque National Liberation Movement]] (MLNV) regards present police actions as violence, torture and state terrorism). Nevertheless, most of their members and certainly most of their leadership were former Batasuna supporters or affiliates. The Spanish Supreme Court unanimously considered the party to be a successor to Batasuna and declared a ban on it.\n\nAfter Aukera Guztiak had been banned, and less than two weeks before the election, another political group appeared born from an earlier schism from Herri Batasuna, the [[Communist Party of the Basque Lands]] (EHAK/PCTV, ''Euskal Herrialdeetako Alderdi Komunista/Partido Comunista de las Tierras Vascas''), a formerly unknown political party which had no representation in the Autonomous Basque Parliament. EHAK made the announcement that they would apply the votes they obtained to sustain the political programme of the now banned Aukera Guztiak platform.\n\nThis move left no time for the Spanish courts to investigate EHAK in compliance with the ''Ley de Partidos'' before the elections were held.

However, the [[last use of capital punishment in Spain]] when two ETA members were executed in September 1975, eight weeks before Franco's death, sparked massive domestic and international protests against the Spanish government.\n\n===During the transition===\nDuring the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] which began following Franco's death, ETA split into two separate groups: [[ETA political-military]] or ETA(pm), and ETA military or ETA(m).\n\nBoth ETA(m) and ETA(pm) refused offers of amnesty, and instead pursued and intensified their violent struggle. The years 1978\u201380 were to prove ETA's most deadly, with 68, 76, and 98 fatalities, respectively.\n\nDuring the [[Franco dictatorship]], ETA was able to take advantage of tolerance by the [[French government]], which allowed its members to move freely through French territory, believing that in this manner they were contributing to the end of Franco's regime. There is much controversy over the degree to which this policy of \"[[sanctuary]]\" continued even after the transition to democracy, but it is generally agreed that currently the French authorities collaborated closely with the Spanish government against ETA.\n\nIn the 1980s, ETA(pm) accepted the Spanish government's offer of individual pardons to all ETA prisoners, even those who had committed violent crimes, who publicly abandoned the policy of violence. This caused a new division in ETA(pm) between the seventh and eighth assemblies. ETA VII accepted this partial amnesty granted by the now democratic Spanish government and integrated into the political party ''[[Euskadiko Ezkerra]]'' (\"[[left-wing politics|Left]] of the Basque Country\").<ref>* Gaizka Fern\u00e1ndez Soldevilla, ''Agur a las armas.

They were responsible for the killing of about 48 people.<ref name=\"santamaria437\"/>\n\nOne consequence of GAL's activities in France was the decision in 1984 by interior minister Pierre Joxe to permit the extradition of ETA suspects to Spain. Reaching this decision had taken 25 years and was critical in curbing ETA's capabilities by denial of previously safe territory in France.<ref>''Talking to Terrorists: Making Peace in Northern Ireland and the Basque Country'' (pp. 197\u2013202), John Bew, Martyn Frampton, and Inigo Gurruchaga, Hurst & Co., London.</ref>\n\nThe airing of the state-sponsored \"dirty war\" scheme and the imprisonment of officials responsible for GAL in the early 1990s led to a political scandal in Spain. The group's connections with the state were unveiled by the Spanish journal [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]], with an [[investigative journalism|investigative]] series leading to the GAL plot being discovered and a national trial initiated. As a consequence, the group's attacks since the revelation have generally been dubbed [[state terrorism]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/168958.stm Europe | Former Spanish ministers jailed for 'terrorism'].

The horror caused then was so striking that ETA felt compelled to issue a communiqu\u00e9 stating that they had given warning of the Hipercor bomb, but that the police had declined to evacuate the area. The police claim that the warning came only a few minutes before the bomb exploded.\n\nIn 1986 [[Gesto por la Paz]] (known in English as [[Association for Peace in the Basque Country]]) was founded; they began to convene silent demonstrations in communities throughout the Basque Country the day after any violent killing, whether by ETA or by GAL. These were the first systematic demonstrations in the Basque Country against political violence. Also in 1986, in [[Ordizia]], ETA shot down [[Mar\u00eda Dolores Katarain]], known as \"Yoyes\", while she was walking with her infant son. Yoyes was a former member of ETA who had abandoned the armed struggle and rejoined civil society: they accused her of \"desertion\" because of her taking advantage of the Spanish reinsertion policy which granted amnesty to those prisoners who publicly refused political violence (see below).\n\nOn 12 January 1988, all Basque political parties except ETA-affiliated [[Batasuna|Herri Batasuna]] signed the [[Ajuria-Enea pact]] with the intent of ending ETA's violence. Weeks later on 28 January, ETA announced a 60-day \"ceasefire\", later prolonged several times. Negotiations known as the [[Mesa de Argel]] (\"[[Algiers]] Table\") took place between the ETA representative [[Eugenio Etxebeste]] (\"Antxon\"), and the then PSOE government of Spain but no successful conclusion was reached, and ETA eventually resumed the use of violence.\n\nDuring this period, the Spanish government had a policy referred to as \"[[reinsertion]]\", under which imprisoned ETA members whom the government believed had genuinely abandoned violence could be freed and allowed to rejoin society. Claiming a need to prevent ETA from coercively impeding this reinsertion, the PSOE government decided that imprisoned ETA members, who previously had all been imprisoned within the Basque Country, would instead be dispersed to prisons throughout Spain, some as far from their families as in the [[Salto del Negro]] prison in the [[Canary Islands]]. France has taken a similar approach.\n\nIn the event, the only clear effect of this policy was to incite social protest, especially from nationalists and families of the prisoners, claiming cruelty of separating family members from the insurgents. Much of the protest against this policy runs under the slogan \"''Euskal Presoak \u2013 Euskal Herrira''\" (''Basque prisoners to the Basque Country'', by \"Basque prisoners\" only ETA members are meant). It has to be noted that almost in any Spanish jail there is a group of ETA prisoners, as the number of ETA prisoners makes it difficult to disperse them.\n\n[[File:EPPK 2008.jpg|thumb|Banner in support of imprisoned ETA members, by ''[[Gestoras pro Amnist\u00eda|Gestoras pro Amnist\u00eda/Amnistiaren Aldeko Batzordeak]]'' (\"Pro-Amnesty Managing Assemblies\", currently illegal)]]\n\n''[[Gestoras pro Amnist\u00eda|Gestoras pro Amnist\u00eda/Amnistiaren Aldeko Batzordeak]]'' (\"Pro-Amnesty Managing Assemblies\", currently illegal), later ''[[Askatasuna]]'' (\"Freedom\") and ''[[Senideak]]'' (\"The family members\") provided support for prisoners and families. The [[Basque Government]] and several Nationalist town halls granted money on humanitarian reasons for relatives to visit prisoners. The long road trips have caused accidental deaths that are protested against by Nationalist Prisoner's Family supporters.\n\nDuring the ETA ceasefire of the late 1990s, the PSOE government brought back to the mainland the prisoners on the islands and in Africa.<!-- Is this Ceuta and Melilla? -->{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Since the end of the ceasefire, ETA prisoners have not been sent back to overseas prisons. Some Basque authorities have established grants for the expenses of visiting families.\n\nAnother Spanish \"counter-terrorist\" law puts suspected terrorist cases under the central tribunal ''[[Audiencia Nacional]]'' in [[Madrid]], due to the threats by the group over the Basque courts. Under Article 509 suspected terrorists are subject to being held \"incommunicado\" for up to thirteen days, during which they have no contact with the outside world other than through the court-appointed lawyer, including informing their family of their arrest, consultation with private lawyers or examination by a physician other than the [[coroner]]s. In comparison, the [[habeas corpus]] term for other suspects is three days.\n\nIn 1992, ETA's three top leaders\u2014\"military\" leader [[Francisco Mujika Garmendia]] (\"Pakito\"), political leader [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Alvarez Santacristina]] (\"Txelis\") and logistical leader [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arregi Erostarbe]] (\"Fiti\"), often referred to collectively as the \"c\u00fapula\" of ETA or as the Artapalo collective<ref>[http://www.informativos.telecinco.es/dn_16360.htm Informativos Telecinco.com \u2013 Internacional \u2013 Trece muertos y m\u00e1s de cincuenta heridos en dos atentados suicidas en Bangladesh].

The principal consequence of the change appears to have been the creation of the \"''[[Y Groups]]''\", formed by young militants of ETA parallel groups (generally [[minor (law)|minors]]), dedicated to so-called \"''kale borroka''\"\u2014street struggle\u2014and whose activities included burning buses, street lamps, benches, [[Automatic teller machine|ATMs]], garbage containers, and throwing [[Molotov cocktail]]s. The appearance of these groups was attributed by many to the supposed weakness of ETA, which obliged them to resort to minors to maintain or augment their impact on society after arrests of leading militants, including the \"cupola\". ETA also began to menace leaders of other parties besides rival Basque nationalist parties.\n\nIn 1995, the armed group again launched a peace proposal. The so-called \"Democratic Alternative\" replaced the earlier [[Koordinadora Abertzale Sozialista|KAS]] Alternative as a minimum proposal for the establishment of Euskal Herria. The Democratic Alternative offered the cessation of all armed ETA activity if the Spanish-government would recognize the Basque people as having sovereignty over Basque territory, the right to [[self-determination]] and that it freed all ETA members in prison. The Spanish government ultimately rejected this peace offer as it would go against the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]. Changing the constitution was not considered.\n\nAlso in 1995 came a failed ETA car bombing attempt directed against [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar]], a conservative politician who was leader of the then-opposition [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] (PP) and was shortly after elected to the presidency of the government; there was also an abortive attempt in [[Majorca]] on the life of King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos&nbsp;I]]. Still, the act with the largest social impact came the following year. 10 July 1997, PP council member [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco]] was kidnapped in the Basque town of [[Ermua]], with the separatist group threatening to assassinate him unless the Spanish government met ETA's demand of starting to bring all ETA's inmates to prisons of the Basque Country within two days after the kidnapping.\n\nThis demand was not met by the Spanish government and after three days Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco was found shot dead when the deadline expired. More than six million people took out to the streets to demand his liberation, with massive demonstrations occurring as much in the Basque regions as elsewhere in Spain, chanting cries of \"Assassins\" and \"Basques yes, ETA no\". This response came to be known as the \"Spirit of Ermua\".\n\nLater came acts of violence such as the 6 November 2001 car bomb in Madrid which injured 65 people, and attacks on [[Association football|football]] stadiums and tourist destinations throughout Spain.\n\nThe [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the USA appeared to have dealt a hard blow to ETA, owing to the worldwide toughening of \"anti-terrorist\" measures (such as the freezing of bank accounts), the increase in international police coordination, and the end of the toleration some countries had, up until then, extended to ETA. In addition, in 2002 the Basque nationalist youth movement, ''Jarrai'', was outlawed and the law of parties was changed outlawing Herri Batasuna, the \"political arm\" of ETA (although even before the change in law, Batasuna had been largely paralysed and under judicial investigation by judge [[Baltasar Garz\u00f3n]]).\n\nWith ever-increasing frequency, attempted ETA actions were frustrated by Spanish security forces.\n\nOn 24 December 2003, in San Sebasti\u00e1n and in [[Hernani, Spain|Hernani]], National Police arrested two ETA members who had left dynamite in a railroad car prepared to explode in [[Chamart\u00edn Station]] in Madrid.

When the bombs targeted individuals for assassination they were often surreptitiously rigged in the victim's car. The detonating systems varied. They were rarely manually ignited but instead, for example, wired so the bomb would explode on ignition or when the car went over a set speed limit. Sometimes the bomb was placed inside a stolen car with false plates, parked along the route of the objective, and the explosive remotely activated when the target passed by (e.g. V.I.P. cars, police patrols or military vehicles).\n\nThese bombs sometimes killed family members of ETA's target victim and bystanders. When the bombs were large car-bombs seeking to produce large damage and terror, they were generally announced by one or more telephone calls made to newspapers speaking in the name of ETA. Charities (usually [[Detente Y Ayuda]]\u2014DYA) were also used to announce the threat if the bomb was in a populated area. The type of explosives used in these attacks were initially [[Goma-2]] or self-produced [[ammonal]].

[[Extortion]] was ETA's main source of funds.\n\n==Basque nationalist context==\nETA was considered to form part of what is informally known as the [[Basque National Liberation Movement]], a movement born much after ETA's creation. This loose term refers to a range of political organizations that are ideologically similar, comprising several distinct organizations that promote a type of [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Basque nationalism that is often referred to by the Basque-language term ''Ezker [[Abertzale]]a'' (Nationalist Left). Other groups typically considered to belong to this independentist movement are: the political party [[Batasuna]], the nationalist youth organization [[Segi (organization)|Segi]], the labour union [[Langile Abertzaleen Batzordeak]] (LAB), and [[Askatasuna]] among others. There are often strong interconnections between these groups, double or even triple membership are not infrequent.<ref name = \"jvjtfe\"/>\n\nThere are Basque nationalist parties with similar goals as those of ETA (namely, independence) but who openly reject their violent means. They are: [[EAJ-PNV]], [[Eusko Alkartasuna]], [[Aralar Party|Aralar]] and, in the [[French Basque country]], [[Abertzaleen Batasuna]]. In addition, a number of left-wing parties, such as [[United Left (Spain)|Ezker Batua]], [[Batzarre]] and some sectors of the [[EAJ-PNV]] party, also support self-determination but are not in favour of independence.\n\n==French role==\nHistorically, members of ETA took refuge in France, particularly the [[French Basque Country]].

The [[French government]] quietly tolerated the group, especially during [[Francoist Spain|Franco's regime]], when ETA members could face the death penalty in Spain. In the 1980s, the advent of the [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci\u00f3n|GAL]] still hindered [[counter-terrorist]] cooperation between France and Spain, with the French government considering ETA a Spanish domestic problem. At the time, ETA members often travelled between the two countries using the French sanctuary as a base of operations.<ref>[http://www.france24.com/en/20080926-spain-basque-separatism-batasuna-eta Spain looks to France for help against Basque separatists].

Virtually all of the highest ranks within ETA \u2013including their successive \"military\", \"political\" or finances chiefs \u2013 have been captured in French territory, from where they had been plotting their activities after having crossed the border from Spain.\n\nIn response to the new situation, ETA carried out attacks against French policemen and made threats to some French judges and prosecutors.

The group used to have a very hierarchical organization with a leading figure at the top, delegating into three substructures: the logistical, military and political sections. Reports from Spanish and French police pointed towards significant changes in ETA's structures in its later years. ETA divided the three substructures into a total of eleven. The change was a response to captures, and possible infiltration, by the different law enforcement agencies. ETA's intention was to disperse its members and reduce the effects of detentions.\n\nThe leading committee comprised 7 to 11 individuals, and ETA's internal documentation referred to it as Zuba, an abbreviation of ''Zuzendaritza Batzordea'' (directorial committee). There was another committee named ''Zuba-hitu'' that functioned as an advisory committee. The eleven different substructures were: logistics, politics, international relations with fraternal organisations, military operations, reserves, prisoner support, expropriation, information, recruitment, negotiation, and treasury.<ref>[http://www.elcorreodigital.com/vizcaya/pg060323/actualidad/politica/200603/23/ECD_eta_funcionamiento.html POL\u00cdTICA \u2013 ETA ha modificado su estructura interna por motivos de seguridad].

In the past there was also the figure of the deportees, expelled by the French government to remote countries where they lived freely. ETA's internal bulletin was named ''[[Zutabe]]'' (\"Column\"), replacing the earlier one (1962) ''[[Zutik (publication)|Zutik]]'' (\"Standing\").\n\nETA also promoted the ''[[kale borroka]]'' (\"street fight\"), that is, violent acts against public transportation, political parties' offices or cultural buildings, destruction of private property of politicians, police, military, journalist, council members, and anyone voicing criticism against ETA. Bank offices, menaces, graffiti of political mottoes, and general rioting, usually using [[Molotov cocktails]]. These groups were mostly made up of young people, who were directed through youth organisations (such as [[Jarrai]], [[Haika]] and [[Segi (organization)|Segi]]).

The bill passed the Cortes with a 304 to 16 vote.<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/2002/06/05/espana/1153258.html El Congreso aprueba la Ley de Partidos con el 95% de los votos], ''El Mundo'', 5 June 2002.</ref> Many within the Basque nationalistic movement strongly disputed the Law, which they considered too draconian or even unconstitutional; alleging that any party could be made illegal almost by choice, simply for not clearly stating their opposition to an attack.\n\nDefenders of the law argued that the ''Ley de Partidos'' did not necessarily require responses to individual acts of violence, but rather a declaration of principles explicitly rejecting violence as a means of achieving political goals. Defenders also argued that the ban of a political party is subject to judicial process, with all the guarantees of the State of Law. Batasuna had failed to produce such a statement. {{As of|2008|alt=As of February 2008}} other political parties linked to organizations such as ''[[Communist Party of Spain (Reconstituted)|Partido Comunista de Espa\u00f1a (reconstituido)]]'' have also been declared illegal, and [[Acci\u00f3n Nacionalista Vasca]] and [[Communist Party of the Basque Lands]] (EHAK/PCTV, ''Euskal Herrialdeetako Alderdi Komunista/Partido Comunista de las Tierras Vascas'') were declared illegal in September 2008.\n\nA new party called [[Aukera Guztiak]] ''(All the Options)'' was formed expressly for the elections to the [[Basque Parliament]] of April 2005. Its supporters claimed no heritage from Batasuna, asserting that their aim was to allow Basque citizens to freely express their political ideas, even those of independence. On the matter of political violence, Aukera Guztiak stated their right not to condemn some kinds of violence more than others if they did not see fit (in this regard, the [[Basque National Liberation Movement]] (MLNV) regards present police actions as violence, torture and state terrorism). Nevertheless, most of their members and certainly most of their leadership were former Batasuna supporters or affiliates. The Spanish Supreme Court unanimously considered the party to be a successor to Batasuna and declared a ban on it.\n\nAfter Aukera Guztiak had been banned, and less than two weeks before the election, another political group appeared born from an earlier schism from Herri Batasuna, the [[Communist Party of the Basque Lands]] (EHAK/PCTV, ''Euskal Herrialdeetako Alderdi Komunista/Partido Comunista de las Tierras Vascas''), a formerly unknown political party which had no representation in the Autonomous Basque Parliament. EHAK made the announcement that they would apply the votes they obtained to sustain the political programme of the now banned Aukera Guztiak platform.\n\nThis move left no time for the Spanish courts to investigate EHAK in compliance with the ''Ley de Partidos'' before the elections were held.

However, the [[last use of capital punishment in Spain]] when two ETA members were executed in September 1975, eight weeks before Franco's death, sparked massive domestic and international protests against the Spanish government.\n\n===During the transition===\nDuring the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] which began following Franco's death, ETA split into two separate groups: [[ETA political-military]] or ETA(pm), and ETA military or ETA(m).\n\nBoth ETA(m) and ETA(pm) refused offers of amnesty, and instead pursued and intensified their violent struggle. The years 1978\u201380 were to prove ETA's most deadly, with 68, 76, and 98 fatalities, respectively.\n\nDuring the [[Franco dictatorship]], ETA was able to take advantage of tolerance by the [[French government]], which allowed its members to move freely through French territory, believing that in this manner they were contributing to the end of Franco's regime. There is much controversy over the degree to which this policy of \"[[sanctuary]]\" continued even after the transition to democracy, but it is generally agreed that currently the French authorities collaborated closely with the Spanish government against ETA.\n\nIn the 1980s, ETA(pm) accepted the Spanish government's offer of individual pardons to all ETA prisoners, even those who had committed violent crimes, who publicly abandoned the policy of violence. This caused a new division in ETA(pm) between the seventh and eighth assemblies. ETA VII accepted this partial amnesty granted by the now democratic Spanish government and integrated into the political party ''[[Euskadiko Ezkerra]]'' (\"[[left-wing politics|Left]] of the Basque Country\").<ref>* Gaizka Fern\u00e1ndez Soldevilla, ''Agur a las armas.

They were responsible for the killing of about 48 people.<ref name=\"santamaria437\"/>\n\nOne consequence of GAL's activities in France was the decision in 1984 by interior minister Pierre Joxe to permit the extradition of ETA suspects to Spain. Reaching this decision had taken 25 years and was critical in curbing ETA's capabilities by denial of previously safe territory in France.<ref>''Talking to Terrorists: Making Peace in Northern Ireland and the Basque Country'' (pp. 197\u2013202), John Bew, Martyn Frampton, and Inigo Gurruchaga, Hurst & Co., London.</ref>\n\nThe airing of the state-sponsored \"dirty war\" scheme and the imprisonment of officials responsible for GAL in the early 1990s led to a political scandal in Spain. The group's connections with the state were unveiled by the Spanish journal [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]], with an [[investigative journalism|investigative]] series leading to the GAL plot being discovered and a national trial initiated. As a consequence, the group's attacks since the revelation have generally been dubbed [[state terrorism]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/168958.stm Europe | Former Spanish ministers jailed for 'terrorism'].

The horror caused then was so striking that ETA felt compelled to issue a communiqu\u00e9 stating that they had given warning of the Hipercor bomb, but that the police had declined to evacuate the area. The police claim that the warning came only a few minutes before the bomb exploded.\n\nIn 1986 [[Gesto por la Paz]] (known in English as [[Association for Peace in the Basque Country]]) was founded; they began to convene silent demonstrations in communities throughout the Basque Country the day after any violent killing, whether by ETA or by GAL. These were the first systematic demonstrations in the Basque Country against political violence. Also in 1986, in [[Ordizia]], ETA shot down [[Mar\u00eda Dolores Katarain]], known as \"Yoyes\", while she was walking with her infant son. Yoyes was a former member of ETA who had abandoned the armed struggle and rejoined civil society: they accused her of \"desertion\" because of her taking advantage of the Spanish reinsertion policy which granted amnesty to those prisoners who publicly refused political violence (see below).\n\nOn 12 January 1988, all Basque political parties except ETA-affiliated [[Batasuna|Herri Batasuna]] signed the [[Ajuria-Enea pact]] with the intent of ending ETA's violence. Weeks later on 28 January, ETA announced a 60-day \"ceasefire\", later prolonged several times. Negotiations known as the [[Mesa de Argel]] (\"[[Algiers]] Table\") took place between the ETA representative [[Eugenio Etxebeste]] (\"Antxon\"), and the then PSOE government of Spain but no successful conclusion was reached, and ETA eventually resumed the use of violence.\n\nDuring this period, the Spanish government had a policy referred to as \"[[reinsertion]]\", under which imprisoned ETA members whom the government believed had genuinely abandoned violence could be freed and allowed to rejoin society. Claiming a need to prevent ETA from coercively impeding this reinsertion, the PSOE government decided that imprisoned ETA members, who previously had all been imprisoned within the Basque Country, would instead be dispersed to prisons throughout Spain, some as far from their families as in the [[Salto del Negro]] prison in the [[Canary Islands]]. France has taken a similar approach.\n\nIn the event, the only clear effect of this policy was to incite social protest, especially from nationalists and families of the prisoners, claiming cruelty of separating family members from the insurgents. Much of the protest against this policy runs under the slogan \"''Euskal Presoak \u2013 Euskal Herrira''\" (''Basque prisoners to the Basque Country'', by \"Basque prisoners\" only ETA members are meant). It has to be noted that almost in any Spanish jail there is a group of ETA prisoners, as the number of ETA prisoners makes it difficult to disperse them.\n\n[[File:EPPK 2008.jpg|thumb|Banner in support of imprisoned ETA members, by ''[[Gestoras pro Amnist\u00eda|Gestoras pro Amnist\u00eda/Amnistiaren Aldeko Batzordeak]]'' (\"Pro-Amnesty Managing Assemblies\", currently illegal)]]\n\n''[[Gestoras pro Amnist\u00eda|Gestoras pro Amnist\u00eda/Amnistiaren Aldeko Batzordeak]]'' (\"Pro-Amnesty Managing Assemblies\", currently illegal), later ''[[Askatasuna]]'' (\"Freedom\") and ''[[Senideak]]'' (\"The family members\") provided support for prisoners and families. The [[Basque Government]] and several Nationalist town halls granted money on humanitarian reasons for relatives to visit prisoners. The long road trips have caused accidental deaths that are protested against by Nationalist Prisoner's Family supporters.\n\nDuring the ETA ceasefire of the late 1990s, the PSOE government brought back to the mainland the prisoners on the islands and in Africa.<!-- Is this Ceuta and Melilla? -->{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Since the end of the ceasefire, ETA prisoners have not been sent back to overseas prisons. Some Basque authorities have established grants for the expenses of visiting families.\n\nAnother Spanish \"counter-terrorist\" law puts suspected terrorist cases under the central tribunal ''[[Audiencia Nacional]]'' in [[Madrid]], due to the threats by the group over the Basque courts. Under Article 509 suspected terrorists are subject to being held \"incommunicado\" for up to thirteen days, during which they have no contact with the outside world other than through the court-appointed lawyer, including informing their family of their arrest, consultation with private lawyers or examination by a physician other than the [[coroner]]s. In comparison, the [[habeas corpus]] term for other suspects is three days.\n\nIn 1992, ETA's three top leaders\u2014\"military\" leader [[Francisco Mujika Garmendia]] (\"Pakito\"), political leader [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Alvarez Santacristina]] (\"Txelis\") and logistical leader [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arregi Erostarbe]] (\"Fiti\"), often referred to collectively as the \"c\u00fapula\" of ETA or as the Artapalo collective<ref>[http://www.informativos.telecinco.es/dn_16360.htm Informativos Telecinco.com \u2013 Internacional \u2013 Trece muertos y m\u00e1s de cincuenta heridos en dos atentados suicidas en Bangladesh].

The principal consequence of the change appears to have been the creation of the \"''[[Y Groups]]''\", formed by young militants of ETA parallel groups (generally [[minor (law)|minors]]), dedicated to so-called \"''kale borroka''\"\u2014street struggle\u2014and whose activities included burning buses, street lamps, benches, [[Automatic teller machine|ATMs]], garbage containers, and throwing [[Molotov cocktail]]s. The appearance of these groups was attributed by many to the supposed weakness of ETA, which obliged them to resort to minors to maintain or augment their impact on society after arrests of leading militants, including the \"cupola\". ETA also began to menace leaders of other parties besides rival Basque nationalist parties.\n\nIn 1995, the armed group again launched a peace proposal. The so-called \"Democratic Alternative\" replaced the earlier [[Koordinadora Abertzale Sozialista|KAS]] Alternative as a minimum proposal for the establishment of Euskal Herria. The Democratic Alternative offered the cessation of all armed ETA activity if the Spanish-government would recognize the Basque people as having sovereignty over Basque territory, the right to [[self-determination]] and that it freed all ETA members in prison. The Spanish government ultimately rejected this peace offer as it would go against the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]. Changing the constitution was not considered.\n\nAlso in 1995 came a failed ETA car bombing attempt directed against [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar]], a conservative politician who was leader of the then-opposition [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] (PP) and was shortly after elected to the presidency of the government; there was also an abortive attempt in [[Majorca]] on the life of King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos&nbsp;I]]. Still, the act with the largest social impact came the following year. 10 July 1997, PP council member [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco]] was kidnapped in the Basque town of [[Ermua]], with the separatist group threatening to assassinate him unless the Spanish government met ETA's demand of starting to bring all ETA's inmates to prisons of the Basque Country within two days after the kidnapping.\n\nThis demand was not met by the Spanish government and after three days Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco was found shot dead when the deadline expired. More than six million people took out to the streets to demand his liberation, with massive demonstrations occurring as much in the Basque regions as elsewhere in Spain, chanting cries of \"Assassins\" and \"Basques yes, ETA no\". This response came to be known as the \"Spirit of Ermua\".\n\nLater came acts of violence such as the 6 November 2001 car bomb in Madrid which injured 65 people, and attacks on [[Association football|football]] stadiums and tourist destinations throughout Spain.\n\nThe [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the USA appeared to have dealt a hard blow to ETA, owing to the worldwide toughening of \"anti-terrorist\" measures (such as the freezing of bank accounts), the increase in international police coordination, and the end of the toleration some countries had, up until then, extended to ETA. In addition, in 2002 the Basque nationalist youth movement, ''Jarrai'', was outlawed and the law of parties was changed outlawing Herri Batasuna, the \"political arm\" of ETA (although even before the change in law, Batasuna had been largely paralysed and under judicial investigation by judge [[Baltasar Garz\u00f3n]]).\n\nWith ever-increasing frequency, attempted ETA actions were frustrated by Spanish security forces.\n\nOn 24 December 2003, in San Sebasti\u00e1n and in [[Hernani, Spain|Hernani]], National Police arrested two ETA members who had left dynamite in a railroad car prepared to explode in [[Chamart\u00edn Station]] in Madrid.

When the bombs targeted individuals for assassination they were often surreptitiously rigged in the victim's car. The detonating systems varied. They were rarely manually ignited but instead, for example, wired so the bomb would explode on ignition or when the car went over a set speed limit. Sometimes the bomb was placed inside a stolen car with false plates, parked along the route of the objective, and the explosive remotely activated when the target passed by (e.g. V.I.P. cars, police patrols or military vehicles).\n\nThese bombs sometimes killed family members of ETA's target victim and bystanders. When the bombs were large car-bombs seeking to produce large damage and terror, they were generally announced by one or more telephone calls made to newspapers speaking in the name of ETA. Charities (usually [[Detente Y Ayuda]]\u2014DYA) were also used to announce the threat if the bomb was in a populated area. The type of explosives used in these attacks were initially [[Goma-2]] or self-produced [[ammonal]].

[[Extortion]] was ETA's main source of funds.\n\n==Basque nationalist context==\nETA was considered to form part of what is informally known as the [[Basque National Liberation Movement]], a movement born much after ETA's creation. This loose term refers to a range of political organizations that are ideologically similar, comprising several distinct organizations that promote a type of [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Basque nationalism that is often referred to by the Basque-language term ''Ezker [[Abertzale]]a'' (Nationalist Left). Other groups typically considered to belong to this independentist movement are: the political party [[Batasuna]], the nationalist youth organization [[Segi (organization)|Segi]], the labour union [[Langile Abertzaleen Batzordeak]] (LAB), and [[Askatasuna]] among others. There are often strong interconnections between these groups, double or even triple membership are not infrequent.<ref name = \"jvjtfe\"/>\n\nThere are Basque nationalist parties with similar goals as those of ETA (namely, independence) but who openly reject their violent means. They are: [[EAJ-PNV]], [[Eusko Alkartasuna]], [[Aralar Party|Aralar]] and, in the [[French Basque country]], [[Abertzaleen Batasuna]]. In addition, a number of left-wing parties, such as [[United Left (Spain)|Ezker Batua]], [[Batzarre]] and some sectors of the [[EAJ-PNV]] party, also support self-determination but are not in favour of independence.\n\n==French role==\nHistorically, members of ETA took refuge in France, particularly the [[French Basque Country]].

The [[French government]] quietly tolerated the group, especially during [[Francoist Spain|Franco's regime]], when ETA members could face the death penalty in Spain. In the 1980s, the advent of the [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci\u00f3n|GAL]] still hindered [[counter-terrorist]] cooperation between France and Spain, with the French government considering ETA a Spanish domestic problem. At the time, ETA members often travelled between the two countries using the French sanctuary as a base of operations.<ref>[http://www.france24.com/en/20080926-spain-basque-separatism-batasuna-eta Spain looks to France for help against Basque separatists].

Virtually all of the highest ranks within ETA \u2013including their successive \"military\", \"political\" or finances chiefs \u2013 have been captured in French territory, from where they had been plotting their activities after having crossed the border from Spain.\n\nIn response to the new situation, ETA carried out attacks against French policemen and made threats to some French judges and prosecutors.

After his death, his wife, [[Florence Maybrick]], was convicted of murdering him by poisoning in a sensational trial. The \"[[Aigburth]] Poisoning\" case was widely reported in the press on both sides of the [[Atlantic]]. \n\nMore than a century after his death, Maybrick was accused of being the notorious serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]], through his own words in a diary, but critics countered that the diary and confession are a hoax. Forensic tests were inconclusive. In his book ''They All Love Jack,'' writer, researcher, and filmmaker Bruce Robinson produced an argument that it was his brother, Michael Maybrick, who was the true killer.\nA serial killer, who became known as the [[Servant Girl Annihilator]], preyed upon the city of [[Austin, Texas]] during 1884 and 1885, and there have also been attempts to link Maybrick to those murders.\n\n==Life==\nMaybrick was born in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], the son of William Maybrick, an engraver, and his wife, Susanna. He was christened on 12 November 1838, at St Peter's Church in the city. He was named after a brother who had died the year before and was the Maybricks' third of seven sons.\n[[File:Mrs Florence Maybrick.jpg|thumb|left|Mrs Florence Maybrick was convicted of James' death]]\n\nMaybrick's cotton trading business required him to travel regularly to the [[United States]] and in 1871 he settled in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]], to establish a branch office of his company. While there in 1874 he contracted [[malaria]], which was then treated with a medication containing arsenic; he became addicted to the drug for the rest of his life.\nIn 1880, Maybrick returned to the company's offices in Britain. Sailing from [[New York City|New York]] on 12 March 1880, he arrived in Liverpool six days later. During the journey he was introduced to Florence (Florie) Elizabeth Chandler, the daughter of a banker from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]], and their relationship quickly blossomed. Despite the difference in their ages{{spaced ndash}}he was 42 to her 18{{spaced ndash}}they began to plan their wedding immediately.\n\nThe wedding was delayed until 27 July 1881, when it took place at St James' Church, [[Piccadilly]], [[London]]. The couple returned to Liverpool to live at Maybrick's home, \"Battlecrease House\" in [[Aigburth]], a suburb in the south of the city.\n\nThey had two children: a son, James Chandler (\"Bobo\") born in 1882 and a daughter, Gladys Evelyn, born in 1886.\n\nMaybrick continued to divide his time between the American and the British offices of his company and this may have caused difficulties within his marriage. He also resumed his relationships with his many mistresses, while his wife conducted an affair with an Alfred Brierley, a cotton broker. It is possible Florence embarked upon this on learning of her husband's infidelity.\n\nIn Maybrick's case a common-law wife, Sarah Ann Robertson, was identified. Sarah Ann is mentioned in her stepfather's [[will (law)|will]] as \"Sarah Ann Maybrick, wife of James\".\n\n==Death==\n\nMaybrick's health deteriorated suddenly on 27 April 1889, and he died fifteen days later at his home in [[Aigburth]]. The circumstances of his death were deemed suspicious by his brothers and an inquest, held in a local hotel, came to the verdict that arsenic poisoning was the most likely cause, administered by persons unknown.\n\nSuspicion immediately fell on Florence and she was arrested some days later. She stood trial at [[Liverpool Crown Court]] and, after lengthy proceedings, the fairness of which was the subject of some debate in later years, she was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The way in which the judge conducted her trial was questioned and this was probably the reason her sentence was [[clemency|commuted]] to [[life imprisonment]], some of which she served in a prison in [[Woking]], [[Surrey]], and then at the \"House of Detention\" at [[Aylesbury]], [[Buckinghamshire]].\n\nA re-examination of her case resulted in her release in 1904. She supported herself through various occupations until her death on 23 October 1941. From her initial incarceration until her death, she never saw her children again.\n\n==Family==\nAfter their mother's conviction and imprisonment, Maybrick's children James and Gladys Evelyn were taken in by a Dr. Charles Chinner Fuller and his wife Gertrude, and the younger James changed his name to Fuller.\n\nJames Fuller became a mining engineer in [[British Columbia]]. In 1911, at the age of 29, while working at the Le Roi Gold Mine in Canada, he died after drinking [[cyanide]], apparently thinking it was just a glass of water. His sister Gladys went to live in [[Ryde]], [[Isle of Wight]], with her uncle and aunt Michael and Laura (n\u00e9e Withers) Maybrick before marrying Frederick James Corbyn in [[Hampstead]], London, in 1912. She died in [[South Wales]] in 1971, where the couple lived in their later years.<ref>[http://www.jamesmaybrick.org/ was he Jack The Ripper?]. James Maybrick. Retrieved on 2011-08-27.</ref>\n\nJames Maybrick's brother, [[Michael Maybrick]], was a composer who published many pieces and songs under the name Stephen Adams. \"Good Company\" is one such example, but by far his best known work was the hymn [[The Holy City (song)|\u201cThe Holy City\u201d]].\n\n==Jack the Ripper diary==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2010}}\nIn 1992, a document presented as James Maybrick's diary surfaced, which claimed that he was [[Jack the Ripper]]. The diary's author does not mention his own name, but offers enough hints and references consistent with Maybrick's established life and habits that it is obvious readers are expected to believe it is him. The author of the document details alleged actions and crimes over a period of several months, taking credit for slaying the five victims most commonly credited to Jack the Ripper as well as for two other murders which have to date not been historically identified.\n\nThe diary was  first introduced to the world by Michael Barrett, an unemployed former Liverpool scrap metal dealer, who claimed at the time that it had been given to him by a friend, Tony Devereux, in a [[Public house|pub]]. When this was queried, the story changed.   Barrett's wife Ann, formerly Graham, said that the diary had been in her family for as long as she could remember. She had asked Devereux to give it to her husband because he had literary aspirations and she thought he might write a book about it. She had not wanted to tell him her family owned it because she thought he would ask her father about it and relations between the two men were strained. It was published as ''The Diary of Jack the Ripper'' in 1993 to great controversy. Few experts gave it any credence from the outset, and most immediately dismissed it as a hoax, though some were open to the possibility it might be genuine. Debate was often heated, and one writer notes that the \"saga of the Maybrick diary is confusing, complicated and inescapably tortuous.\"<ref>[http://casebook.org/ripper_media/book_reviews/non-fiction/diaryinside.html Jack the Ripper \u2013 The Ripper Diary: The Inside Story]. Casebook. Retrieved on 2011-08-27.</ref>\n\nTests carried out on the ink used in the diary produced contradictory findings. The first test, using [[thin layer chromatography]] (TLC) revealed the ink contained no iron, and was based on a synthetic dye called [[nigrosine]],<ref>Baxendale, D.  1992. Report by David Baxendale, Birmingham, Document Evidence</ref> patented and commercially available in 1867, and in general use in writing inks by the 1870s.<ref>Nickell, J.  1990.

According to one source, chloroacetamide was introduced into the [[Merck Index]] in 1857, but not used commercially in ink until 1972.<ref>Harrison, p. 339</ref> In 1995, Dr Earl Morris of the [[Dow Chemical Company]] stated that chloroacetamide has been found in preparations as early as 1857.<ref>Harrison, p. 340</ref> A fourth test, this time using [[gas chromatography]], found chloroacetamide present, at 6.5 [[parts per million]].<ref>Harrison, p. 342</ref> A fifth TLC test found traces of chloroacetamide, but this was attributed to contamination from the [[Scientific control|control]].<ref>Leeds University, Department of Colour Chemistry. 1994. \"Report for The Word Team on the Analysis of the Ink used to write the \u201cJack the Ripper\u201d Diaries \u2013 24th November 1994.\"  Leeds, Leeds University</ref>  The test was carried out again, and no chloroacetamide was found.<ref>Leeds University, Department of Colour Chemistry.  1994. \"Presence of Chlorocetamide in ink used in diary attributed to \u201cJack the Ripper\u201d \u2013 1st December 1994.\" Leeds, Leeds University</ref>\n\nAmong the investigators were sceptic [[Joe Nickell]] and document expert [[Kenneth W. Rendell]]. In Rendell's analysis, he was struck that the handwriting style seemed more 20th century than Victorian. He also noted factual contradictions and handwriting inconsistencies. Written in a genuine Victorian scrapbook, but with 20 pages at the front end torn out, he also found this suspect as there was no logical explanation for the purported author to use such a book.<ref>Kenneth W. Rendell. Forging History: The Detection of Fake Letters and Documents</ref>\n\nIn January 1995, Michael Barrett swore in two separate [[affidavit]]s that he was \"the author of the Manuscript written by my wife Anne Barrett at my dictation which is known as The Jack the Ripper Diary.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://casebook.org/suspects/james_maybrick/mb-con.bjan5.html | title=Jack the Ripper \u2013 Michael Barrett's Confessions | publisher=Casebook | date=5 January 1995 | accessdate=22 July 2012 }}</ref> Adding to the confusion, however, was Barrett's solicitor's subsequent repudiation of his affidavit, then Barrett's withdrawal of the repudiation.\n\nSome people, including Robert Smith, the present owner of the diary and original publisher of the associated book by Shirley Harrison, insist it may be genuine. They argue that scientific dating methods have established that the book and ink used to write in it are from the 19th century; that the symptoms of arsenic addiction, claimed to be described accurately in the book, are known to very few persons; that some details of the murders provided in it were known only to police and the Ripper himself before the book's publication; and that one of the original crime scene photographs shows the initials \"F. M.\" written on a wall behind the victim's body in what appears to be blood. These, they claim, refer to Florence Maybrick, James's wife, whose possible infidelities were the purported motivation for the murders. These claims are dismissed by the majority of experts.<ref>[http://casebook.org/dissertations/maybrick_diary/ Jack the Ripper \u2013 Maybrick Diary Dissertations]. Casebook.

The watch has \"J.

After his death, his wife, [[Florence Maybrick]], was convicted of murdering him by poisoning in a sensational trial. The \"[[Aigburth]] Poisoning\" case was widely reported in the press on both sides of the [[Atlantic]]. \n\nMore than a century after his death, Maybrick was accused of being the notorious serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]], through his own words in a diary, but critics countered that the diary and confession are a hoax. Forensic tests were inconclusive. In his book ''They All Love Jack,'' writer, researcher, and filmmaker Bruce Robinson produced an argument that it was his brother, Michael Maybrick, who was the true killer.\nA serial killer, who became known as the [[Servant Girl Annihilator]], preyed upon the city of [[Austin, Texas]] during 1884 and 1885, and there have also been attempts to link Maybrick to those murders.\n\n==Life==\nMaybrick was born in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], the son of William Maybrick, an engraver, and his wife, Susanna. He was christened on 12 November 1838, at St Peter's Church in the city. He was named after a brother who had died the year before and was the Maybricks' third of seven sons.\n[[File:Mrs Florence Maybrick.jpg|thumb|left|Mrs Florence Maybrick was convicted of James' death]]\n\nMaybrick's cotton trading business required him to travel regularly to the [[United States]] and in 1871 he settled in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]], to establish a branch office of his company. While there in 1874 he contracted [[malaria]], which was then treated with a medication containing arsenic; he became addicted to the drug for the rest of his life.\nIn 1880, Maybrick returned to the company's offices in Britain. Sailing from [[New York City|New York]] on 12 March 1880, he arrived in Liverpool six days later. During the journey he was introduced to Florence (Florie) Elizabeth Chandler, the daughter of a banker from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]], and their relationship quickly blossomed. Despite the difference in their ages{{spaced ndash}}he was 42 to her 18{{spaced ndash}}they began to plan their wedding immediately.\n\nThe wedding was delayed until 27 July 1881, when it took place at St James' Church, [[Piccadilly]], [[London]]. The couple returned to Liverpool to live at Maybrick's home, \"Battlecrease House\" in [[Aigburth]], a suburb in the south of the city.\n\nThey had two children: a son, James Chandler (\"Bobo\") born in 1882 and a daughter, Gladys Evelyn, born in 1886.\n\nMaybrick continued to divide his time between the American and the British offices of his company and this may have caused difficulties within his marriage. He also resumed his relationships with his many mistresses, while his wife conducted an affair with an Alfred Brierley, a cotton broker. It is possible Florence embarked upon this on learning of her husband's infidelity.\n\nIn Maybrick's case a common-law wife, Sarah Ann Robertson, was identified. Sarah Ann is mentioned in her stepfather's [[will (law)|will]] as \"Sarah Ann Maybrick, wife of James\".\n\n==Death==\n\nMaybrick's health deteriorated suddenly on 27 April 1889, and he died fifteen days later at his home in [[Aigburth]]. The circumstances of his death were deemed suspicious by his brothers and an inquest, held in a local hotel, came to the verdict that arsenic poisoning was the most likely cause, administered by persons unknown.\n\nSuspicion immediately fell on Florence and she was arrested some days later. She stood trial at [[Liverpool Crown Court]] and, after lengthy proceedings, the fairness of which was the subject of some debate in later years, she was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The way in which the judge conducted her trial was questioned and this was probably the reason her sentence was [[clemency|commuted]] to [[life imprisonment]], some of which she served in a prison in [[Woking]], [[Surrey]], and then at the \"House of Detention\" at [[Aylesbury]], [[Buckinghamshire]].\n\nA re-examination of her case resulted in her release in 1904. She supported herself through various occupations until her death on 23 October 1941. From her initial incarceration until her death, she never saw her children again.\n\n==Family==\nAfter their mother's conviction and imprisonment, Maybrick's children James and Gladys Evelyn were taken in by a Dr. Charles Chinner Fuller and his wife Gertrude, and the younger James changed his name to Fuller.\n\nJames Fuller became a mining engineer in [[British Columbia]]. In 1911, at the age of 29, while working at the Le Roi Gold Mine in Canada, he died after drinking [[cyanide]], apparently thinking it was just a glass of water. His sister Gladys went to live in [[Ryde]], [[Isle of Wight]], with her uncle and aunt Michael and Laura (n\u00e9e Withers) Maybrick before marrying Frederick James Corbyn in [[Hampstead]], London, in 1912. She died in [[South Wales]] in 1971, where the couple lived in their later years.<ref>[http://www.jamesmaybrick.org/ was he Jack The Ripper?]. James Maybrick. Retrieved on 2011-08-27.</ref>\n\nJames Maybrick\u2019s brother, [[Michael Maybrick]], was a composer who published many pieces and songs under the name Stephen Adams. \"Good Company\" is one such example, but by far his best known work was the hymn [[The Holy City (song)|\u201cThe Holy City\u201d]].\n\n==Jack the Ripper diary==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2010}}\nIn 1992, a document presented as James Maybrick's diary surfaced, which claimed that he was [[Jack the Ripper]]. The diary's author does not mention his own name, but offers enough hints and references consistent with Maybrick's established life and habits that it is obvious readers are expected to believe it is him. The author of the document details alleged actions and crimes over a period of several months, taking credit for slaying the five victims most commonly credited to Jack the Ripper as well as for two other murders which have to date not been historically identified.\n\nThe diary was  first introduced to the world by Michael Barrett, an unemployed former Liverpool scrap metal dealer, who claimed at the time that it had been given to him by a friend, Tony Devereux, in a [[Public house|pub]]. When this was queried, the story changed.   Barrett's wife Ann, formerly Graham, said that the diary had been in her family for as long as she could remember. She had asked Devereux to give it to her husband because he had literary aspirations and she thought he might write a book about it. She had not wanted to tell him her family owned it because she thought he would ask her father about it and relations between the two men were strained. It was published as ''The Diary of Jack the Ripper'' in 1993 to great controversy. Few experts gave it any credence from the outset, and most immediately dismissed it as a hoax, though some were open to the possibility it might be genuine. Debate was often heated, and one writer notes that the \"saga of the Maybrick diary is confusing, complicated and inescapably tortuous.\"<ref>[http://casebook.org/ripper_media/book_reviews/non-fiction/diaryinside.html Jack the Ripper \u2013 The Ripper Diary: The Inside Story]. Casebook. Retrieved on 2011-08-27.</ref>\n\nTests carried out on the ink used in the diary produced contradictory findings. The first test, using [[thin layer chromatography]] (TLC) revealed the ink contained no iron, and was based on a synthetic dye called [[nigrosine]],<ref>Baxendale, D.  1992. Report by David Baxendale, Birmingham, Document Evidence</ref> patented and commercially available in 1867, and in general use in writing inks by the 1870s.<ref>Nickell, J.  1990.  Pen, Ink and Evidence, 978-0813117195</ref><ref>Harrison</ref> The second TLC test found nothing in the ink inconsistent with the date of 1888, and that the ink contained iron and sodium, but no nigrosine.<ref>Eastaugh, N.  1992.

Middlesex</ref> The third TLC test found nothing inconsistent with the Victorian period.<ref name=\"autogenerated341\">Harrison, p. 341</ref> A fourth TLC test was attempted, but could not be carried out.<ref name=\"autogenerated341\"/>\n\nSeveral tests were carried out to find out whether the ink contained [[chloroacetamide]], a preservative, in an effort to definitively date the ink. According to one source, chloroacetamide was introduced into the [[Merck Index]] in 1857, but not used commercially in ink until 1972.<ref>Harrison, p. 339</ref> In 1995, Dr Earl Morris of the [[Dow Chemical Company]] stated that chloroacetamide has been found in preparations as early as 1857.<ref>Harrison, p. 340</ref> A fourth test, this time using [[gas chromatography]], found chloroacetamide present, at 6.5 [[parts per million]].<ref>Harrison, p. 342</ref> A fifth TLC test found traces of chloroacetamide, but this was attributed to contamination from the [[Scientific control|control]].<ref>Leeds University, Department of Colour Chemistry. 1994. \"Report for The Word Team on the Analysis of the Ink used to write the \u201cJack the Ripper\u201d Diaries \u2013 24th November 1994.\"  Leeds, Leeds University</ref>  The test was carried out again, and no chloroacetamide was found.<ref>Leeds University, Department of Colour Chemistry.  1994. \"Presence of Chlorocetamide in ink used in diary attributed to \u201cJack the Ripper\u201d \u2013 1st December 1994.\" Leeds, Leeds University</ref>\n\nAmong the investigators were sceptic [[Joe Nickell]] and document expert [[Kenneth W. Rendell]]. In Rendell's analysis, he was struck that the handwriting style seemed more 20th century than Victorian. He also noted factual contradictions and handwriting inconsistencies. Written in a genuine Victorian scrapbook, but with 20 pages at the front end torn out, he also found this suspect as there was no logical explanation for the purported author to use such a book.<ref>Kenneth W. Rendell. Forging History: The Detection of Fake Letters and Documents</ref>\n\nIn January 1995, Michael Barrett swore in two separate [[affidavit]]s that he was \"the author of the Manuscript written by my wife Anne Barrett at my dictation which is known as The Jack the Ripper Diary.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://casebook.org/suspects/james_maybrick/mb-con.bjan5.html | title=Jack the Ripper \u2013 Michael Barrett's Confessions | publisher=Casebook | date=5 January 1995 | accessdate=22 July 2012 }}</ref> Adding to the confusion, however, was Barrett's solicitor's subsequent repudiation of his affidavit, then Barrett's withdrawal of the repudiation.\n\nSome people, including Robert Smith, the present owner of the diary and original publisher of the associated book by Shirley Harrison, insist it may be genuine. They argue that scientific dating methods have established that the book and ink used to write in it are from the 19th century; that the symptoms of arsenic addiction, claimed to be described accurately in the book, are known to very few persons; that some details of the murders provided in it were known only to police and the Ripper himself before the book's publication; and that one of the original crime scene photographs shows the initials \"F. M.\" written on a wall behind the victim's body in what appears to be blood. These, they claim, refer to Florence Maybrick, James's wife, whose possible infidelities were the purported motivation for the murders. These claims are dismissed by the majority of experts.<ref>[http://casebook.org/dissertations/maybrick_diary/ Jack the Ripper \u2013 Maybrick Diary Dissertations]. Casebook.
