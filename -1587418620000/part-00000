She was the orphaned daughter of Mordecai's uncle, another Benjamite named Abihail. Upon the king's orders Esther was taken to palace where Hegai prepared her for meeting the king. Even as she advanced to the highest position of the harem, perfumed with [[myrrh]] and allocated certain foods and servants, she was under strict instructions from Mordecai, who met with her each day, to conceal her Jewish origins. The king falls in love with her and makes her Queen.<ref name=\"art01\" />\n\nLater, Mordecai refuses to bow to [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the [[Agagite]], who was recently made Ahasuerus' highest advisor, and Haman requests and is given permission to order all the Jews in Persia to be killed. When Esther learns of this, Mordecai tells her to reveal to the king that she is Jewish and to ask him to repeal the order. Esther hesitates, saying that she could be put to death if she goes to the king without being summoned and the king does not want to see her; Mordecai urges her to try. She goes to the king, and the king welcomes her, and says he will give her anything she wants.  Instead of asking directly about the order, she invites the king and Haman to a banquet the next day. During the banquet, the king again asked Esther if there is anything she wants, and this time she asks the king to spare her life and that of all of the Jews. The king asks who was threatening them, and she names Haman. Haman throws himself at her feet; the king thinks that Haman is attacking her and orders him to be put to death, and gives all Haman's possessions to Esther. Esther tells the king about Mordecai's role in her life, and the king makes Mordecai his highest advisor. Esther then asks the king to revoke the order, and king allows Esther and Mordecai to do so, however they wish. They send out an order in the king's name that Jews can assemble and defend themselves, and can kill anyone who threatens them, and their families, and take their goods. On the thirteenth day of Adar, the same day that Haman had set for them to be killed, the Jews do so in one city, killing 500 people but not taking plunder, and they kill around 75,000 the next day again not taking plunder, and then they feast.<ref name=\"je\">{{cite book |last1=Hirsch |first1=Emil G. |last2=Prince |first2=John Dyneley |last3=Schechter |first3=Solomon |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |date=1936 |publisher=Funk & Wagnalls Co. |location=New York |chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5872-esther |chapter=Esther}}</ref>{{Wide image|Mordecai and Esther.jpg|500|Early 3rd century CE Roman painting of Esther and Mordechai,<br/> [[Dura-Europos synagogue]], [[Syria]].|5=right|alt=3rd century CE Roman fresco of Esther and Mordechai from Dura-Europos Synagogue, Syria}}\n\n==Purim==\n{{Main article|Purim}}\nThe Jews established an annual feast, the feast of [[Purim]], in memory of their deliverance.

She was the orphaned daughter of Mordecai's uncle, another Benjamite named Abihail. Upon the king's orders Esther was taken to palace where Hegai prepared her for meeting the king. Even as she advanced to the highest position of the harem, perfumed with [[myrrh]] and allocated certain foods and servants, she was under strict instructions from Mordecai, who met with her each day, to conceal her Jewish origins. The king falls in love with her and makes her Queen.<ref name=\"art01\" />\n\nLater, Mordecai refuses to bow to [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the [[Agagite]], who was recently made Ahasuerus' highest advisor, and Haman requests and is given permission to order all the Jews in Persia to be killed. When Esther learns of this, Mordecai tells her to reveal to the king that she is Jewish and to ask him to repeal the order. Esther hesitates, saying that she could be put to death if she goes to the king without being summoned and the king does not want to see her; Mordecai urges her to try. She goes to the king, and the king welcomes her, and says he will give her anything she wants.  Instead of asking directly about the order, she invites the king and Haman to a banquet the next day. During the banquet, the king again asked Esther if there is anything she wants, and this time she asks the king to spare her life and that of all of the Jews. The king asks who was threatening them, and she names Haman. Haman throws himself at her feet; the king thinks that Haman is attacking her and orders him to be put to death, and gives all Haman's possessions to Esther. Esther tells the king about Mordecai's role in her life, and the king makes Mordecai his highest advisor. Esther then asks the king to revoke the order, and king allows Esther and Mordecai to do so, however they wish. They send out an order in the king's name that Jews can assemble and defend themselves, and can kill anyone who threatens them, and their families, and take their goods. On the thirteenth day of Adar, the same day that Haman had set for them to be killed, the Jews do so in one city, killing 500 people but not taking plunder, and they kill around 75,000 the next day again not taking plunder, and then they feast.<ref name=\"je\">{{cite book |last1=Hirsch |first1=Emil G. |last2=Prince |first2=John Dyneley |last3=Schechter |first3=Solomon |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |date=1936 |publisher=Funk & Wagnalls Co. |location=New York |chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5872-esther |chapter=Esther}}</ref>{{Wide image|Mordecai and Esther.jpg|500|Early 3rd century CE Roman fresco of Esther and Mordechai,<br/> [[Dura-Europos synagogue]], [[Syria]].|5=right|alt=3rd century CE Roman fresco of Esther and Mordechai from Dura-Europos Synagogue, Syria}}\n\n==Purim==\n{{Main article|Purim}}\nThe Jews established an annual feast, the feast of [[Purim]], in memory of their deliverance.

MS 288 contains a [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] showing Esther sending a message to Mordecai that some instructions he gave are too risky for her to fulfill. The Heilspiegel Altarpiece by [[Konrad Witz]] depicts Esther appearing before the king to beg mercy for the Jews, despite the punishment for appearing without being summoned being death.<ref name=\"art01\" />[[File:The Feast of Esther by Johannes Spilberg the Younger.jpg|left|thumb|280x280px|''The Feast of Esther'' by [[Johannes Spilberg|Johannes Spilberg the Younger]], c.1644]][[File:Ester y Mardoqueo escribiendo la primera carta del Purim (Ester, 9-20-21) - Aert de GELDER - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|thumbnail|260px|''Esther and Mordecai Writing the First Purim Letter'' by Aert de Gelder, c.1685|alt=|left]]\n\n==Canonicity in Christianity==\nThe status of Esther as a [[Biblical canon|canonical book]] of the Bible has historically been under dispute. For example, in the first several centuries of Christianity, Esther does not appear in the lists of books produced by [[Melito]], [[Athanasius]], [[Cyril]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], and others. Additionally, no copies of Esther were found at Qumran in the contents of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Nevertheless, by the fourth century CE, the majority of Western churches accepted Esther as a part of their Bibles.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Baker Academic | isbn = 978-0-80104710-7 | last = McDonald | first = Lee Martin | title = The Biblical Canon: Its Origin, Transmission, and Authority | date = 2006-11-01 | pages = 56, 109, 128, 131}}</ref>\n\nEsther is also commemorated as a matriarch in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] on May 24. She is also recognized as a saint in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] Churches.\n\"The Septuagint edition of Esther contains six parts (totaling 107 verses) not found in the Hebrew Bible. Although these interpretations originally may have been composed in Hebrew, they survive only in Greek texts. Because the Hebrew Bible\u2019s version of Esther\u2019s story contains neither prayers nor even a single reference to God, Greek redactors apparently felt compelled to give the tale a more explicit religious orientation, alluding to \"God\" or the \"Lord\" fifty times.\"<ref>{{Citation | title = The Old Testament: An Introduction to the Hebrew Bible | page = 375 | first1 = Stephen | last1 = Harris | first2 = Robert | last2 = Platzner}}.</ref> These additions to Esther in the Apocrypha were added approximately in the second or first century BCE.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls | page = 182 | first1 = James | last1 = Vanderkam | first2 = Peter | last2 = Flint}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = Esther | work = LXX | publisher = EC Marsh | url = http://www.ecmarsh.com/lxx/Esther/}}.</ref>\n\nThe story of Esther is also made reference to in chapter 28 of [[Meqabyan#First Book of Ethiopian Maccabees (Meqabyan 1)|1 Meqabyan]], a book considered [[Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon|canonical]] in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]].\n\n== Music ==\n* [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]]'', Historia Esther'', H 396, for soloists, chorus, strings and continuo 1675.\n* [[George Frideric Handel]], Esther, libretto by John Arbuthnot et Alexander Pope, 1718 and 1732.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Zaeske, Susan. \"Unveiling Esther as a Pragmatic Radical Rhetoric\", ''Philosophy and Rhetoric'', vol. 33, issue 3.\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book | edition = 1st | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 978-0-41516780-2| last = Beal | first = Timothy K.| title = The Book of Hiding: Gender, Ethnicity, Annihilation, and Esther| location = London; New York | date = 1997-12-11}} Postmodern theoretical apparatus, e.g., [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]].\n* {{Cite book | edition = 2nd | publisher = Wipf & Stock | isbn = 978-1-60899495-3 | last = Fox| first = Michael V. | title = Character and Ideology in the Book of Esther: Second Edition with a New Postscript on a Decade of Esther Scholarship | location = Eugene, OR | date = 2010-04-01 |authorlink= Michael V.

This was the first single released after he changed his name from David (also Davie) Jones to David Bowie.\n\nIt was the first David Bowie record to be released in the US as well as the first time the name \"Bowie\" appeared under the songwriters credit.\n\nThe song was recorded within 15 days of the 18-year-old Bowie signing to the Pye Records label as \"David Bowie with the Lower Third\" on 25 November 1965 through successful producer and songwriter [[Tony Hatch]]. Hatch signed Bowie to the label based on two demos (this song and \"Now You've Met The London Boys\", as it was originally titled) proffered by Bowie's (then) manager [[Ralph Horton]]. The single and B-side were both recorded in the basement of Pye's offices in [[Great Cumberland Place]] (near Marble Arch, Central London) on 10 December 1965. Hatch also played piano on the single and provided backing vocals along with the rest of the group.\n\nThe single was \"promo launched\" by Pye on 6 January 1966 at The Gaiety Bar, Bayswater. The launch party (for Pye records staff and music journalists) was paid for by a loan from businessman Raymond Cook, an agreement which took several years to untangle and eventually pay back. Among those who attended the launch party that evening was John Lennon's father [[Alfred Lennon]], who was also signed to the Pye label as an artist. Lennon Senior's presence was recalled as him being \"highly inebriated\" and asking the attendees \"Do you know who I am?\"\n\n\"Can't help thinking about me\" was officially released on Friday 14 January (and later released in the US by Warner Bros. in May 1966), however, the Lower Third split from Bowie on 28 January over financial disagreements regarding \"who was being paid what\" with manager Ralph Horton. Believing Bowie was not supporting their side of the argument, Graham Rivens, Phil Lancaster and Dennis Taylor ended their short-lived collaboration and reluctantly walked away, literally weeks after their record deal with Pye Records. A strikingly similar manipulation of \"divide and rule\" about money between Bowie and his band by the incumbent manager ([[Tony DeFries]]) occurred 7 years later with the Spiders from Mars.\n\nThe single failed to make either the UK or the US charts despite being reasonably well received by the critics at the time.\n\nAfter dropping the song from his gigs after mid 1966 (he played it several times with new band Buzz at The Marquee due to it being released in May in the USA),  \"Can't Help Thinking About Me\" was eventually resurrected 31 years later and played live regularly in 1999, as well as on the Bowie VH1 Storytellers programme. Prior to singing it, he explained that it was \"a beautiful piece of solipsism\" then told the audience that the song featured two of the worst lines he felt he had ever written. ''\"I actually have to sing this....'My girl calls my name \"Hi Dave\", Drop in, Come back, See you around if you're this way again....\"''\n\nA key collector's item today because of its rarity, the UK vinyl release averages over \u00a3600 per copy with the UK and the US \"Demonstration Only\" copies achieving in excess of \u00a31000.

The unusual middle name, Buckminster, was an ancestral family name. As a child, Richard Buckminster Fuller tried numerous variations of his name. He used to sign his name differently each year in the guest register of his family summer vacation home at Bear Island, Maine. He finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work|last=Sieden|first=Steven|year=2000|isbn=978-0738203799|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFuller spent much of his youth on [[Bear Island (Maine)|Bear Island]], in [[Penobscot Bay]] off the coast of Maine. He attended [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Froebel]]ian Kindergarten.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}  He disagreed with the way [[geometry]] was taught in school, being unable to experience for himself that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented an \"empty\" mathematical [[Point (geometry)|point]], or that a line  could stretch off to [[infinity]]. To him these were illogical, and led to his work on synergetics. He often made items from materials he found in the woods, and sometimes made his own tools. He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats. By age 12, he had invented a 'push pull' system for propelling a rowboat by use of an inverted umbrella connected to the [[transom (nautical)|transom]] with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat toward its destination. Later in life, Fuller took exception to the term \"invention\".\n\nYears later, he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design, but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would require. Fuller earned a [[machinist]]'s certification, and knew how to use the [[press brake]], stretch press, and other tools and equipment used in the [[sheet metal]] trade.<ref name=pawley>{{cite book |last=Pawley |first=Martin |title=Buckminster Fuller |location=New York |publisher=Taplinger |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8008-1116-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/buckminsterfulle00pawl }}</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\n\nFuller attended [[Milton Academy]] in Massachusetts, and after that began studying at [[Harvard College]], where he was affiliated with [[Adams House (Harvard University)|Adams House]]. He was expelled from Harvard twice: first for spending all his money partying with a [[vaudeville]] troupe, and then, after having been readmitted, for his \"irresponsibility and lack of interest\".

He also served in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in World War I, as a shipboard radio operator, as an editor of a publication, and as commander of the [[crash rescue boat]] [[USS Inca (SP-1212)|USS ''Inca'']]. After discharge, he worked again in the meat packing industry, acquiring management experience. In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett.

The Fuller family had no savings, and the birth of their daughter Allegra in 1927 added to the financial challenges. Fuller drank heavily and reflected upon the solution to his family's struggles on long walks around Chicago.

Although the geodesic dome had been created 26 years earlier by Dr. [[Walther Bauersfeld]], Fuller was awarded United States patents, even though he neglected to cite Bauersfeld's prior art in his patent applications. He is credited for popularizing this type of structure.\n\nOne of his early models was first constructed in 1945 at [[Bennington College]] in Vermont, where he lectured often. In 1949, he erected his first geodesic dome building that could sustain its own weight with no practical limits. It was {{convert|4.3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter and constructed of aluminium aircraft tubing and a vinyl-plastic skin, in the form of an [[icosahedron]]. To prove his design, Fuller suspended from the structure's framework several students who had helped him build it. The U.S. government recognized the importance of his work, and employed his firm Geodesics, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina to make small domes for the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. Within a few years, there were thousands of such domes around the world.\n\nFuller's first \"continuous tension \u2013 discontinuous compression\" geodesic dome (full sphere in this case) was constructed at the University of Oregon Architecture School in 1959 with the help of students.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Dymaxion world of Buckminster Fuller |first1=Robert W. |last1=Marks |first2=R.

He documented his life, philosophy and ideas scrupulously by a daily [[diary]] (later called the ''[[Dymaxion Chronofile]]''), and by twenty-eight publications. Fuller financed some of his experiments with inherited funds, sometimes augmented by funds invested by his collaborators, one example being the [[Dymaxion car]] project.\n\n=== World stage ===\n[[File:Biosph\u00e8re Montr\u00e9al.jpg|right|thumb|220px|The [[Montreal Biosph\u00e8re]] by Buckminster Fuller, 1967.]]\n[[File:Preserved R Buckminster Fuller and Anne Hewlitt Dome Home.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[R.

Fuller lectured at [[North Carolina State University]] in Raleigh in 1949, where he met James Fitzgibbon, who would become a close friend and colleague. Fitzgibbon was director of Geodesics, Inc. and Synergetics, Inc. the first licensees to design geodesic domes. Thomas C. Howard was lead designer, architect and engineer for both companies.

I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process\u2014an integral function of the universe.\"\n\nFuller wrote that the natural [[analytic geometry]] of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra. He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres and the number of compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous [[truss]] is cyclically tetrahedral.<ref>Edmondson, Amy, \"A Fuller Explanation\", Birkhauser, Boston, 1987, p19 tetrahedra, p110 octet truss</ref>\n\nHe had become a [[guru]] of the design, architecture, and 'alternative' communities, such as [[Drop City]], the community of experimental artists to whom he awarded the 1966 \"Dymaxion Award\" for \"poetically economic\" domed living structures.\n\n== Major design projects ==\n[[File:G\u00e9ode V 3 1.gif|thumb|right|220px|A geodesic sphere.]]\n\n=== The geodesic dome ===\n\nFuller was most famous for his [[thin-shell structure|lattice shell structures]] \u2013 [[geodesic dome]]s, which have been used as parts of military radar stations, civic buildings, environmental protest camps and exhibition attractions.

The Fuller Dome is referenced in the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novel ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]'' by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], in which a geodesic dome is said to cover the entire island of [[Manhattan]], and it floats on air due to the hot-air balloon effect of the large air-mass under the dome (and perhaps its construction of lightweight materials).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cjfearnley.com/fuller-faq-4.html#ss4.1 |title=The R.

Fuller had built three models that drew enthusiastic crowds wherever. Like all Fuller's other projects (he was responsible for refining and developing the geodesic dome, the first practical dome structure) it was inexpensive, durable and energy efficient; Fuller worked diligently to cut back the amount of material and energy used by any product he designed. \"You've produced exactly the car I've always wanted to produce,\" the mechanically apt Chrysler told him. Then Chrysler noted ruefully, Fuller had taken one-third the time and one fourth the money Chrysler's corporation usually spent producing prototypes &mdash; prototypes Chrysler himself usually hated in the end. For a few months, it had seemed Chrysler would go ahead and introduce Fuller's car. But the banks that financed Chrysler's wholesale distributors vetoed the move by threatening to call in their loans. The bankers were afraid (or so Fuller said years later) that an advanced new design would diminish the value of the unsold motor vehicles in dealers' showrooms.  For every new car sold, five used cars had to be sold to finance the distribution and production chain, and those cars would not sell if Fuller's invention made them obsolete. | url = https://books.google.com/?id=YDQgqe4lpLQC&pg=PT26&dq=the+age+of+heretics+dymaxion+like+all+other+of+fuller%27s#v=onepage&q=the%20age%20of%20heretics%20dymaxion%20like%20all%20other%20of%20fuller%27s&f=false| isbn = 9780470443415 }}</ref><ref name=\"Marks 1973 29\">{{Cite book |title=The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller |last=Marks  |first=Robert |year=1973 |publisher=Anchor Press / Doubleday |isbn= |pages=29 }}</ref>\n\nShortly after launch, a prototype crashed after being hit by another car, killing the Dymaxion's driver.<ref name=\"accident\">{{cite web|title=Passenger Files: Francis T.

Here the term \"Dymaxion\" is used in effect to signify a \"radically strong and light tensegrity structure\". One of Fuller's Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. Designed and developed during the mid-1940s, this prototype is a round structure (not a dome), shaped something like the flattened \"bell\" of certain jellyfish. It has several innovative features, including revolving dresser drawers, and a fine-mist shower that reduces water consumption. According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house was designed to be delivered in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers. A circular structure at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling and air circulation.\n\nConceived nearly two decades earlier, and developed in [[Wichita, Kansas]], the house was designed to be lightweight, adapted to windy climates, cheap to produce and easy to assemble. Because of its light weight and portability, the Dymaxion House was intended to be the ideal housing for individuals and families who wanted the option of easy mobility.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=Jonathan|year=2012|title=Buckminster Fuller's Reflexive Modernism|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=325\u2013344|doi=10.2752/175470812X13361292229159}}</ref> The design included a \"Go-Ahead-With-Life Room\" stocked with maps, charts, and helpful tools for travel \"through time and space\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Planetary Homeboy|last=Wigley|first=M|date=1997|work=Any|access-date=|pages=16\u201323}}</ref> It was to be produced using factories, workers, and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft.

Due to publicity, there were many orders during the early Post-War years, but the company that Fuller and others had formed to produce the houses failed due to management problems.\n\nIn 1967, Fuller developed a concept for an offshore floating city named [[Triton City]] and published a report on the design the following year.<ref>{{cite book|title=A study of a prototype floating community|author=R.

The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray with mesh-covered wireforms for producing large-scale, load-bearing spanning structures built on-site, without the use of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces or hoisting. The initial method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set. Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to {{convert|60|ft|m}}. The form was then draped with layers of \u00bc-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties. Concrete was sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes. However, the tubular frame form proved problematic for setting windows and doors. It was replaced by an iron [[rebar]] set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong. Other shapes such as cones, pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable.\n\nThe project was enabled by a grant underwritten by [[Syracuse University]] and sponsored by [[U.S. Steel]] (rebar), the Johnson Wire Corp, (mesh) and Portland Cement Company (concrete).

B. Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, but as an adult finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller, and signed his letters as such. However, he preferred to be addressed as simply \"Bucky\".{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Language and neologisms ==\n\nBuckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible.<ref>\"What is important in this connection is the way in which humans reflex spontaneously for that is the way in which they usually behave in critical moments, and it is often \"common sense\" to reflex in perversely ignorant ways that produce social disasters by denying knowledge and ignorantly yielding to common sense.\" Intuition, 1972 Doubleday, New York. p.103</ref> Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative) as well as terms he himself invented.<ref>He wrote a single unpunctuated sentence approximately 3000 words long titled \"What I Am Trying to Do.\" And It Came to Pass \u2013 Not to Stay Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1976.</ref>\n\nFuller used the word ''Universe'' without the [[definite article|definite]] or [[indefinite article]]s (''the'' or ''a'') and always capitalized the word. Fuller wrote that \"by Universe I mean: the aggregate of all humanity's consciously apprehended and communicated (to self or others) Experiences\".<ref>\"How Little I Know\" from And It Came to Pass \u2013 Not to Stay Macmillan, 1976</ref>\n\nThe words \"down\" and \"up\", according to Fuller, are awkward in that they refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words \"in\" and \"out\" should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. \"I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going \"outstairs\" and \"instairs.\"' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real 'reality.'\"<ref>''Intuition'' (1972).</ref>\n\n\"World-around\" is a term coined by Fuller to replace \"worldwide\". The general belief in a [[flat Earth]] died out in [[classical antiquity]], so using \"wide\" is an anachronism when referring to the surface of the Earth\u2014a spheroidal surface has area and encloses a volume but has no width. Fuller held that unthinking use of obsolete scientific ideas detracts from and misleads intuition. Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family, according to Allegra Fuller Snyder, are the terms \"sunsight\" and \"sunclipse\", replacing \"sunrise\" and \"sunset\" to overturn the [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] bias of most pre-[[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] [[celestial mechanics]].\n\nFuller also invented the word \"livingry,\" as opposed to weaponry (or \"killingry\"), to mean that which is in support of all human, plant, and Earth life. \"The architectural profession\u2014civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical\u2014has always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry, as opposed to weaponry.\"<ref>Critical Path'', page xxv.</ref>\n\nAs well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology, Fuller invented the term \"[[tensegrity]]\", a portmanteau of \"tensional integrity\". \"Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors. Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder.\"<ref>''Synergetics'', page 372.</ref>\n\n\"[[Dymaxion]]\" is a portmanteau of \"dynamic maximum tension\". It was invented around 1929 by two [[Advertising agency|admen]] at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago to describe Fuller's concept house, which was shown as part of a house of the future store display. They created the term utilizing three words that Fuller used repeatedly to describe his design \u2013 dynamic, maximum, and tension.<ref>''R. Buckminster Fuller \u2013 Autobiographical Monologue/Scenario'',St. Martin's Press, Inc.,1980, page 54.</ref>\n\nFuller also helped to popularize the concept of [[Spaceship Earth]]: \"The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction manual didn't come with it.\"<ref name=\"cjfearnley_com-fortunes_srchstr_Fuller\">{{cite web|title=Selected Quotes|url=http://www.cjfearnley.com/cgi-bin/cjf-fortunes.pl?srchstr=Fuller&name=Submit}} 090810 cjfearnley.com</ref>\n\n== Concepts and buildings ==\n\nHis concepts and buildings include:\n{|\n|\n* [[Dymaxion house]] (1928)\n* [[R.

The unusual middle name, Buckminster, was an ancestral family name. As a child, Richard Buckminster Fuller tried numerous variations of his name. He used to sign his name differently each year in the guest register of his family summer vacation home at Bear Island, Maine. He finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work|last=Sieden|first=Steven|year=2000|isbn=978-0738203799|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFuller spent much of his youth on [[Bear Island (Maine)|Bear Island]], in [[Penobscot Bay]] off the coast of Maine. He attended [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Froebel]]ian Kindergarten.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}  He disagreed with the way [[geometry]] was taught in school, being unable to experience for himself that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented an \"empty\" mathematical [[Point (geometry)|point]], or that a line  could stretch off to [[infinity]]. To him these were illogical, and led to his work on synergetics. He often made items from materials he found in the woods, and sometimes made his own tools. He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats. By age 12, he had invented a 'push pull' system for propelling a rowboat by use of an inverted umbrella connected to the [[transom (nautical)|transom]] with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat toward its destination. Later in life, Fuller took exception to the term \"invention\".\n\nYears later, he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design, but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would require. Fuller earned a [[machinist]]'s certification, and knew how to use the [[press brake]], stretch press, and other tools and equipment used in the [[sheet metal]] trade.<ref name=pawley>{{cite book |last=Pawley |first=Martin |title=Buckminster Fuller |location=New York |publisher=Taplinger |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8008-1116-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/buckminsterfulle00pawl }}</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\n\nFuller attended [[Milton Academy]] in Massachusetts, and after that began studying at [[Harvard College]], where he was affiliated with [[Adams House (Harvard University)|Adams House]].

After discharge, he worked again in the meat packing industry, acquiring management experience. In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett.

Although the geodesic dome had been created 26 years earlier by Dr. [[Walther Bauersfeld]], Fuller was awarded United States patents, even though he neglected to cite Bauersfeld's prior art in his patent applications. He is credited for popularizing this type of structure.\n\nOne of his early models was first constructed in 1945 at [[Bennington College]] in Vermont, where he lectured often. In 1949, he erected his first geodesic dome building that could sustain its own weight with no practical limits. It was {{convert|4.3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter and constructed of aluminium aircraft tubing and a vinyl-plastic skin, in the form of an [[icosahedron]]. To prove his design, Fuller suspended from the structure's framework several students who had helped him build it. The U.S. government recognized the importance of his work, and employed his firm Geodesics, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina to make small domes for the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. Within a few years, there were thousands of such domes around the world.\n\nFuller's first \"continuous tension \u2013 discontinuous compression\" geodesic dome (full sphere in this case) was constructed at the University of Oregon Architecture School in 1959 with the help of students.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Dymaxion world of Buckminster Fuller |first1=Robert W. |last1=Marks |first2=R.

He documented his life, philosophy and ideas scrupulously by a daily [[diary]] (later called the ''[[Dymaxion Chronofile]]''), and by twenty-eight publications. Fuller financed some of his experiments with inherited funds, sometimes augmented by funds invested by his collaborators, one example being the [[Dymaxion car]] project.\n\n=== World stage ===\n[[File:Biosph\u00e8re Montr\u00e9al.jpg|right|thumb|220px|The [[Montreal Biosph\u00e8re]] by Buckminster Fuller, 1967.]]\n[[File:Preserved R Buckminster Fuller and Anne Hewlitt Dome Home.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[R.

Fitzgibbon was director of Geodesics, Inc. and Synergetics, Inc. the first licensees to design geodesic domes. Thomas C. Howard was lead designer, architect and engineer for both companies.

He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres and the number of compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous [[truss]] is cyclically tetrahedral.<ref>Edmondson, Amy, \"A Fuller Explanation\", Birkhauser, Boston, 1987, p19 tetrahedra, p110 octet truss</ref>\n\nHe had become a [[guru]] of the design, architecture, and 'alternative' communities, such as [[Drop City]], the community of experimental artists to whom he awarded the 1966 \"Dymaxion Award\" for \"poetically economic\" domed living structures.\n\n== Major design projects ==\n[[File:G\u00e9ode V 3 1.gif|thumb|right|220px|A geodesic sphere.]]\n\n=== The geodesic dome ===\n\nFuller was most famous for his [[thin-shell structure|lattice shell structures]] \u2013 [[geodesic dome]]s, which have been used as parts of military radar stations, civic buildings, environmental protest camps and exhibition attractions.

Fuller had built three models that drew enthusiastic crowds wherever. Like all Fuller's other projects (he was responsible for refining and developing the geodesic dome, the first practical dome structure) it was inexpensive, durable and energy efficient; Fuller worked diligently to cut back the amount of material and energy used by any product he designed. \"You've produced exactly the car I've always wanted to produce,\" the mechanically apt Chrysler told him. Then Chrysler noted ruefully, Fuller had taken one-third the time and one fourth the money Chrysler's corporation usually spent producing prototypes &mdash; prototypes Chrysler himself usually hated in the end. For a few months, it had seemed Chrysler would go ahead and introduce Fuller's car. But the banks that financed Chrysler's wholesale distributors vetoed the move by threatening to call in their loans. The bankers were afraid (or so Fuller said years later) that an advanced new design would diminish the value of the unsold motor vehicles in dealers' showrooms.  For every new car sold, five used cars had to be sold to finance the distribution and production chain, and those cars would not sell if Fuller's invention made them obsolete. | url = https://books.google.com/?id=YDQgqe4lpLQC&pg=PT26&dq=the+age+of+heretics+dymaxion+like+all+other+of+fuller%27s#v=onepage&q=the%20age%20of%20heretics%20dymaxion%20like%20all%20other%20of%20fuller%27s&f=false| isbn = 9780470443415 }}</ref><ref name=\"Marks 1973 29\">{{Cite book |title=The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller |last=Marks  |first=Robert |year=1973 |publisher=Anchor Press / Doubleday |isbn= |pages=29 }}</ref>\n\nShortly after launch, a prototype crashed after being hit by another car, killing the Dymaxion's driver.<ref name=\"accident\">{{cite web|title=Passenger Files: Francis T.

Here the term \"Dymaxion\" is used in effect to signify a \"radically strong and light tensegrity structure\". One of Fuller's Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. Designed and developed during the mid-1940s, this prototype is a round structure (not a dome), shaped something like the flattened \"bell\" of certain jellyfish. It has several innovative features, including revolving dresser drawers, and a fine-mist shower that reduces water consumption. According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house was designed to be delivered in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers. A circular structure at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling and air circulation.\n\nConceived nearly two decades earlier, and developed in [[Wichita, Kansas]], the house was designed to be lightweight, adapted to windy climates, cheap to produce and easy to assemble. Because of its light weight and portability, the Dymaxion House was intended to be the ideal housing for individuals and families who wanted the option of easy mobility.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=Jonathan|year=2012|title=Buckminster Fuller's Reflexive Modernism|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=325\u2013344|doi=10.2752/175470812X13361292229159}}</ref> The design included a \"Go-Ahead-With-Life Room\" stocked with maps, charts, and helpful tools for travel \"through time and space\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Planetary Homeboy|last=Wigley|first=M|date=1997|work=Any|access-date=|pages=16\u201323}}</ref> It was to be produced using factories, workers, and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft.

Due to publicity, there were many orders during the early Post-War years, but the company that Fuller and others had formed to produce the houses failed due to management problems.\n\nIn 1967, Fuller developed a concept for an offshore floating city named [[Triton City]] and published a report on the design the following year.<ref>{{cite book|title=A study of a prototype floating community|author=R.

The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray with mesh-covered wireforms for producing large-scale, load-bearing spanning structures built on-site, without the use of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces or hoisting. The initial method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set. Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to {{convert|60|ft|m}}. The form was then draped with layers of \u00bc-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties. Concrete was sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes. However, the tubular frame form proved problematic for setting windows and doors. It was replaced by an iron [[rebar]] set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong. Other shapes such as cones, pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable.\n\nThe project was enabled by a grant underwritten by [[Syracuse University]] and sponsored by [[U.S. Steel]] (rebar), the Johnson Wire Corp, (mesh) and Portland Cement Company (concrete). The ability to build large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures in free space would open many possibilities in architecture, and is considered as one of Fuller's greatest contributions.\n\n=== Dymaxion map and World Game ===\n\nFuller, along with co-cartographer [[Shoji Sadao]], also designed an alternative projection map, called the [[Dymaxion map]]. This was designed to show Earth's continents with minimum distortion when projected or printed on a flat surface.\n\nIn the 1960s, Fuller developed the [[World Game]], a collaborative simulation game played on a 70-by-35-foot Dymaxion map,<ref>{{cite news |last=Perry|first=Tony|title=This Game Anything but Child's Play: Buckminster Fuller's creation aims to fight the real enemies of mankind: starvation, disease and illiteracy|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-02/local/me-52516_1_buckminster-fuller|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=October 2, 1995}}</ref> in which players attempt to solve world problems.<ref>{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Allen|title=R.

B. Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, but as an adult finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller, and signed his letters as such. However, he preferred to be addressed as simply \"Bucky\".{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Language and neologisms ==\n\nBuckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible.<ref>\"What is important in this connection is the way in which humans reflex spontaneously for that is the way in which they usually behave in critical moments, and it is often \"common sense\" to reflex in perversely ignorant ways that produce social disasters by denying knowledge and ignorantly yielding to common sense.\" Intuition, 1972 Doubleday, New York. p.103</ref> Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative) as well as terms he himself invented.<ref>He wrote a single unpunctuated sentence approximately 3000 words long titled \"What I Am Trying to Do.\" And It Came to Pass \u2013 Not to Stay Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1976.</ref>\n\nFuller used the word ''Universe'' without the [[definite article|definite]] or [[indefinite article]]s (''the'' or ''a'') and always capitalized the word. Fuller wrote that \"by Universe I mean: the aggregate of all humanity's consciously apprehended and communicated (to self or others) Experiences\".<ref>\"How Little I Know\" from And It Came to Pass \u2013 Not to Stay Macmillan, 1976</ref>\n\nThe words \"down\" and \"up\", according to Fuller, are awkward in that they refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words \"in\" and \"out\" should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. \"I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going \"outstairs\" and \"instairs.\"' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real 'reality.'\"<ref>''Intuition'' (1972).</ref>\n\n\"World-around\" is a term coined by Fuller to replace \"worldwide\". The general belief in a [[flat Earth]] died out in [[classical antiquity]], so using \"wide\" is an anachronism when referring to the surface of the Earth\u2014a spheroidal surface has area and encloses a volume but has no width. Fuller held that unthinking use of obsolete scientific ideas detracts from and misleads intuition. Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family, according to Allegra Fuller Snyder, are the terms \"sunsight\" and \"sunclipse\", replacing \"sunrise\" and \"sunset\" to overturn the [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] bias of most pre-[[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] [[celestial mechanics]].\n\nFuller also invented the word \"livingry,\" as opposed to weaponry (or \"killingry\"), to mean that which is in support of all human, plant, and Earth life. \"The architectural profession\u2014civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical\u2014has always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry, as opposed to weaponry.\"<ref>Critical Path'', page xxv.</ref>\n\nAs well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology, Fuller invented the term \"[[tensegrity]]\", a portmanteau of \"tensional integrity\". \"Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors. Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder.\"<ref>''Synergetics'', page 372.</ref>\n\n\"[[Dymaxion]]\" is a portmanteau of \"dynamic maximum tension\". It was invented around 1929 by two [[Advertising agency|admen]] at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago to describe Fuller's concept house, which was shown as part of a house of the future store display. They created the term utilizing three words that Fuller used repeatedly to describe his design \u2013 dynamic, maximum, and tension.<ref>''R. Buckminster Fuller \u2013 Autobiographical Monologue/Scenario'',St. Martin's Press, Inc.,1980, page 54.</ref>\n\nFuller also helped to popularize the concept of [[Spaceship Earth]]: \"The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction manual didn't come with it.\"<ref name=\"cjfearnley_com-fortunes_srchstr_Fuller\">{{cite web|title=Selected Quotes|url=http://www.cjfearnley.com/cgi-bin/cjf-fortunes.pl?srchstr=Fuller&name=Submit}} 090810 cjfearnley.com</ref>\n\n== Concepts and buildings ==\n\nHis concepts and buildings include:\n{|\n|\n* [[Dymaxion house]] (1928)\n* [[R.

Besides this one exception, there were the overwhelming majority of other purposes for bringing korbanot, and the expiatory effect is often incidental, and is subject to significant limitations. Korbanot are brought purely for the purpose of communing with God and becoming closer to him.

Sins in Judaism consist of different grades of severity:<ref name=\"JE.SIN\"/>\n* The lightest is the ''\u1e25e\u1e6d'', ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6da'ah'', or ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6dat''  (lit. \"fault,\" \"shortcoming,\" \"misstep\"), an infraction of a commandment committed in ignorance of the existence or meaning of that command.\n* The second kind is the ''awon'', a breach of a minor commandment committed with a full knowledge of the existence and nature of that commandment (''bemezid''). \n* The gravest kind is the ''pesha'' or ''mered'', a presumptuous and rebellious act against God. Its worst form is the ''resha'', such an act committed with a wicked intention.\nThese three terms are mentioned by the Psalmist (cvi. 6): \"We have sinned [''\u1e25a\u1e6da'nu''], . . . we have committed iniquity [''he-'ewinu''], we have done wickedly [''hirsha'nu]''\" (comp.

The Prophets disparaged sacrifices that were offered without a regeneration of the heart, i.e., a determined turning from sin and returning to God by striving after righteousness ([[Book of Hosea]] 14:1-2, Joel 2:13, Micah 6:6-8). At the same time, prophets stressed the importance of offerings combined with justice and good even as they taught that offerings were unacceptable unless combined with heartfelt repentance and good deeds. [[Malachi]], the last prophet in the Hebrew Bible, emphasized that the goal of repentance is not to end sacrifices, but to make the offerings fit for acceptance once again ([[Book of Malachi]], 3:3-4). Similarly, the [[Book of Isaiah]] despite disparagement of sacrifices without justice, portrays sacrifice as having a role complementary with prayer in a universalistic [[eschatology]] (Isaiah 56:1; 6-7).\n\n==Rabbinical interpretation==\n\n===100 among the 613 commandments===\nAccording to [[Maimonides]], about one hundred of the permanent [[613 commandments]] based on the Torah, by rabbinical enumeration, directly concern sacrifices, excluding those commandments that concern the actual Temple and the priests themselves of which there are about another fifty.<ref>\n# Not to burn anything on the Golden Altar besides incense (Exodus 30:9)\n# To offer only unblemished animals (Leviticus 22:21)\n# Not to dedicate a blemished animal for the altar (Leviticus 22:20)\n# Not to slaughter it (Leviticus 22:22)\n# Not to sprinkle its blood (Leviticus 22:24)\n# Not to burn its ''[[Chelev|khelev]]'' (Leviticus 22:22)\n# Not to offer a temporarily blemished animal (Deuteronomy 17:1)\n# Not to sacrifice blemished animals even if offered by non-Jews (Leviticus 22:25)\n# Not to inflict wounds upon dedicated animals (Leviticus 22:21)\n# To redeem dedicated animals which have become disqualified (Deuteronomy 12:15)\n# To offer only animals which are at least eight days old (Leviticus 22:27)\n# Not to offer animals bought with the wages of a harlot or the animal exchanged for a dog (Deuteronomy 23:19)\n# Not to burn honey or yeast on the altar (Leviticus 2:11)\n# To salt all sacrifices (Leviticus 2:13)\n# Not to omit the salt from sacrifices (Leviticus 2:13)\n# Carry out the procedure of the burnt offering as prescribed in the Torah (Leviticus 1:3)\n# Not to eat its meat (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# Carry out the procedure of the sin offering (Leviticus 6:18)\n# Not to eat the meat of the inner sin offering (Leviticus 6:23)\n# Not to decapitate a fowl brought as a sin offering (Leviticus 5:8)\n# Carry out the procedure of the guilt offering (Leviticus 7:1)\n# The ''kohanim'' must eat the sacrificial meat in the Temple (Exodus 29:33)\n# The ''kohanim'' must not eat the meat outside the Temple courtyard (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# A non-''kohen'' must not eat sacrificial meat (Exodus 29:33)\n# To follow the procedure of the peace offering (Leviticus 7:11)\n# Not to eat the meat of minor sacrifices before sprinkling the blood (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# To bring meal offerings as prescribed in the Torah (Leviticus 2:1)\n# Not to put oil on the meal offerings of wrongdoers (Leviticus 5:11)\n# Not to put frankincense on the meal offerings of wrongdoers (Leviticus 3:11)\n# Not to eat the meal offering of the High Priest (Leviticus 6:16)\n# Not to bake a meal offering as leavened bread (Leviticus 6:10)\n# The ''kohanim'' must eat the remains of the meal offerings (Leviticus 6:9)\n# To bring all avowed and freewill offerings to the Temple on the first subsequent festival (Deuteronomy 12:5-6)\n# To offer all sacrifices in the Temple (Deuteronomy 12:11)\n# To bring all sacrifices from outside Israel to the Temple (Deuteronomy 12:26)\n# Not to slaughter sacrifices outside the courtyard (of the Temple) (Leviticus 17:4)\n# Not to offer any sacrifices outside the courtyard (of the Temple) (Deuteronomy 12:13)\n# To offer two lambs every day (Numbers 28:3)\n# To light a fire on the altar every day (Leviticus 6:6)\n# Not to extinguish this fire (Leviticus 6:6)\n# To remove the ashes from the altar every day (Leviticus 6:3)\n# To burn incense every day (Exodus 30:7)\n# The ''Kohen Gadol'' must bring a meal offering every day (Leviticus 6:13)\n# To bring two additional lambs as burnt offerings on Shabbat (Numbers 28:9)\n# To bring additional offerings on the New Month (''[[Rosh Khodesh]]'') (Numbers 28:11)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Passover]] (Numbers 28:19)\n# To offer the wave offering from the meal of the new wheat (Leviticus 23:10)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Shavuot]] (Numbers 28:26)\n# To bring two leaves to accompany the above sacrifice (Leviticus 23:17)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Rosh Hashana]] (Numbers 29:2)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Yom Kippur]] (Numbers 29:8)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Sukkot]] (Numbers 29:13)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Shmini Atzeret]] (Numbers 29:35)\n# Not to eat sacrifices which have become unfit or blemished (Deuteronomy 14:3)\n# Not to eat from sacrifices offered with improper intentions (Leviticus 7:18)\n# Not to leave sacrifices past the time allowed for eating them (Leviticus 22:30)\n# Not to eat from that which was left over (Leviticus 19:8)\n# Not to eat from sacrifices which became impure (Leviticus 7:19)\n# An impure person must not eat from sacrifices (Leviticus 7:20)\n# To burn the leftover sacrifices (Leviticus 7:17)\n# To burn all impure sacrifices (Leviticus 7:19)\n# To follow the [sacrificial] procedure of Yom Kippur in the sequence prescribed in ''Parshah [[Acharei]] Mot'' (After the death of [[Aaron]]'s sons...)

In addition, large parts of every other book of the Talmud discuss various kinds of sacrifices. ''Pesachim'' is largely devoted to a discussion of how to offer the [[Passover sacrifice]]. ''Yoma'' contains a detailed discussion of the offerings and Temple ritual on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), and there are sections in ''seder Moed'' (Festivals) for the special offerings and Temple ritual for other major Jewish holidays. ''Sheqalim'' discusses the annual half-shekel offering for Temple maintenance and Temple governance and management, ''Nashim'' discusses the offerings made by [[Nazirite]]s and the suspected adultress, etc.\n\nThe Talmud provides extensive details not only on how to perform sacrifices but how to adjudicate difficult cases, such what to do if a mistake was made and whether improperly performing one of the required ritual elements invalidates it or not. The Talmud explains how to roast the Passover offering, how to dash blood from different kinds of sacrifices upon the altar, how to prepare the incense, the regulatory code for the system of taxation that financed the priesthood and public sacrifices, and numerous other details.\n\n===Rationale and rabbinic commentary===\n[[Maimonides]], a medieval Jewish scholar, drew on the early critiques of the need for sacrifice, taking the view that God always held sacrifice inferior to prayer and philosophical meditation. However, God understood that the Israelites were used to the animal sacrifices that the surrounding pagan tribes used as the primary way to commune with their gods. As such, in Maimonides' view, it was only natural that Israelites would believe that sacrifice would be a necessary part of the relationship between God and man. Maimonides concludes that God's decision to allow sacrifices was a concession to human psychological limitations. It would have been too much to have expected the Israelites to leap from pagan worship to prayer and meditation in one step. In ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', he writes:\n{{quote|But the custom which was in those days general among men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted in sacrificing animals... It was in accordance with the wisdom and plan of God...that God did not command us to give up and to discontinue all these manners of service. For to obey such a commandment would have been contrary to the nature of man, who generally cleaves to that to which he is used; it would in those days have made the same impression as a prophet would make at present [the 12th Century] if he called us to the service of God and told us in His name, that we should not pray to God nor fast, nor seek His help in time of trouble; that we should serve Him in thought, and not by any action.<ref>Book III, Chapter 32. Translated by M. Friedlander, 1904, ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Dover Publications, 1956 edition</ref>}}\n\nIn contrast, many others such as [[Nahmanides]] (in his commentary on Leviticus 1:9) disagreed. Nahmanides cites the fact that the Torah records the practices of animal and other sacrifices from the times of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]] and earlier. Indeed, the purpose of recounting the [[Binding of Isaac|near sacrifice of Isaac]] was to illustrate the sublime significance and need of animal sacrifices as supplanting the abomination of human sacrifices.\n\n===In spiritual practice===\nThe korban also has a spiritual meaning, and refers to some part of an individual's ego, which is given up as a sacrifice to God in honor of the mortality of the worshipper. In keeping with the root of the word, meaning to draw close, and to the common usage as the sacrifice of an animal, so too can the worshipper sacrifice something of this world in order to become closer to God.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =  Dubov\n  | first =  Nissan Dovid \n  | title = Jewish Meditation\n  | publisher =Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center\n  | url = http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=361886\n  | accessdate =  2006-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==The end of sacrifices==\nWith the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans, the Jewish practice of offering korbanot stopped for all intents and purposes. Despite subsequent intermittent periods of small Jewish groups offering the traditional sacrifices on the Temple Mount, the practice effectively ended.\n\n[[Rabbinic Judaism]] was forced to undergo a significant development in response to this change; no longer could Judaism revolve around the Temple services. The destruction of the Temple led to a development of Judaism in the direction of text study, prayer, and personal observance. [[Orthodox Judaism]] regards this as being largely an alternative way of fulfilling the obligations of the Temple. Other branches of Judaism ([[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]]) regard the korbanot as an ancient ritual that will not return. A range of responses is recorded in classical rabbinic literature, describing this subject.\n\n:Once, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai was walking with his disciple, Rabbi Y'hoshua, near Jerusalem after the destruction of the Temple. Rabbi Y'hoshua looked at the Temple ruins and said \"Alas for us!! The place that atoned for the sins of the people Israel lies in ruins!\" Then Rabbi Yohannan ben Zakkai spoke to him these words of comfort:  'Be not grieved, my son. There is another equally meritorious way of gaining ritual atonement, even though the Temple is destroyed. We can still gain ritual atonement through deeds of loving-kindness. For it is written \"Loving kindness I desire, not sacrifice.\" (Hosea 6:6)\n:[[Midrash]] Avot D'Rabbi Nathan 4:5\n\nIn the [[Babylonian Talmud]], a number of sages opined that following Jewish law, doing charitable deeds, and studying Jewish texts is greater than performing animal sacrifices.\n\n:Rabbi Elazar said: Doing righteous deeds of charity is greater than offering all of the sacrifices, as it is written: \"Doing charity and justice is more desirable to the Lord than sacrifice\" (Proverbs 21:3).\n:Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 49\n\nNonetheless, numerous texts of the Talmud stress the importance of and hope for eventual re-introduction of sacrifices, and regard their loss as a terrible tragedy. Partaking of sacrificial offerings was compared to eating directly at one's Father's table, whose loss synagogue worship does not quite entirely replace. One example is in ''Berachot'':\n:And I said to him: I heard a heavenly voice that was cooing like a dove and saying, \"Woe to the children because of whose sins I destroyed My house, and burned My temple, and exiled them among the nations of the world. And he [Elijah the prophet] said to me: \"By your life and the life of your head! It is not only at this moment that [the heavenly voice] says this. But on each and every day it says this three times. And not only this, but at the time that the people of Israel enter the synagogues and houses of study, and respond (in the [[Kaddish]]) \"May His great name be blessed\", the Holy One, Blessed is He, shakes His head and says: \"Fortunate for the king who is praised this way in his house. What is there for the Father who has exiled His children. And woe to the children who have been exiled from their Father's table.\"  (Talmud ''Berachot'' 3a).\n\nAnother example is in ''Sheqalim'':\n:Rabbi Akiva said: Shimon Ben Loga related the following to me: I was once collecting grasses, and I saw a child from the [[House of Avitnas]] (the incense-makers). And I saw that he cried, and I saw that he laughed. I said to him, \"My son, why did you cry?\" He said, Because of the glory of my Father's house that has decreased.\" I asked \"And why did you laugh?\" He said to me \"Because of the glory prepared for the righteous in the future.\" I asked \"And what did you see?\" [that brought on these emotions]. \"The herb ''[[Maaleh Ashan|maaleh ashan]]'' is growing next to me. [''Maaleh Ashan'' is the secret ingredient in the incense that made the smoke rise, which according to the Talmud the [[House of Avitnas]] never revealed.]\"\n\n===Liturgical attention to end of sacrifices===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nNumerous details of the daily religious practice of an ordinary Jew are connected to keeping memory of the rhythm of the life of the Temple and its sacrifices. For example, the Mishna begins with a statement that the [[Shema Yisrael]] prayer is to be recited in the evening at the time when Kohanim who were ''[[Tumah and taharah|tamei]]'' (ritually impure) are permitted to enter to eat their [[heave offering]] (a food-tithe given to priests) following purification. A detailed discussion of the obligations of tithing, ritual purity, and other elements central to the Temple and priesthood is required in order to determine the meaning of this contemporary daily Jewish obligation.\n\n===Other occasions===\nJewish services for [[Shabbat]], Jewish holidays and other occasions include special prayers for the restoration of sacrifices. For example, the traditional Yom Kippur liturgy contains repeated prayers for the restoration of sacrifices and every [[High Holiday]] [[Amidah]] contains [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 56:7:\n:Even them will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon Mine altar; for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.<ref name=\"mechon-mamre.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1056.htm|title=Isaiah 56 / Hebrew - English Bible / Mechon-Mamre|website=www.mechon-mamre.org}}</ref>\n\n==Modern view and resumption of sacrifices==\n\n===Future of sacrifices in Judaism===\n{{see also| Temple in Jerusalem}}\nThe prevailing belief among rabbinic Jews is that in the [[Messianic Age|messianic era]], the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]] will come and a [[Third Temple]] will be built. It is believed that the korbanot will be reinstituted, but to what extent and for how long is unknown. Some biblical and classical rabbinic sources hold that most or all sacrifices will not need to be offered.\n\n* In the future all sacrifices, with the exception of the Thanksgiving-sacrifice, will be discontinued. (Midrash Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)\n* All sacrifices will be annulled in the future. (Tanchuma Emor 14, Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)\n* Then the grain-offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to God as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. (Malachi 3:4)\n* It is impossible to go suddenly from one extreme to the other;...the custom which was in those days general among all men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted of sacrificing animals in the temples... For this reason God allowed this kind of service to continue.  The sacrificial system is not the primary object, rather supplications, and prayer. (Maimonides, The Guide to the Perplexed III 32)\n\nThe majority view of classical rabbis is that the Torah's commandments will still be applicable and in force during the messianic era. However, a significant minority of rabbis held that most of the commandments will be nullified in the messianic era, thus holding that sacrifices will not be reinstated. Examples of such rabbinic views include:\n* Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Niddah 61b and Tractate Shabbat 151b.\n* Midrash Shochar Tov (Mizmor 146:5) states that God will permit what is now forbidden.\n\n[[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that in the messianic era, most or all of the korbanot will be reinstituted, at least for a time. [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]], hold that no animal sacrifices will be offered in a rebuilt Temple at all, following the position of Tanchuma Emor 14 and Vayikra Rabbah 9:7.\n\n===Nineteenth and twentieth century===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nIn the 1800s a number of Orthodox rabbis studied the idea of reinstating korbanot on the Temple Mount, even though the messianic era had not yet arrived and the Temple was not rebuilt. A number of [[responsa]] concluded that within certain parameters, it is permissible according to Jewish law to offer such sacrifices.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, [[Israel Meir Kagan]] advised some followers to set up special ''[[yeshiva]]s'' for married students known as ''Qodshim [[Kolel]]im'' that would specialize in the study of the korbanot and study with greater intensity the ''qodshim'' sections of the [[Talmud]] in order to prepare for the arrival of the Jewish Messiah who would oversee the rebuilding of the original Temple of Solomon in [[Jerusalem]] that would be known as the [[Third Temple]]. His advice was taken seriously and today there are a number of well-established [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] institutions in [[Israel]] that focus solely on the subject of the korbanot, ''qodshim'', and the needs of the future Jewish Temple, such as the [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty]].\n\n===Efforts to restore korbanot===\n{{Main|The Third Temple}}\nA few groups, notably the [[Temple Institute]] and the [[Temple Mount Faithful]], have petitioned the Israeli government to rebuild a Third Temple on the [[Temple Mount]] and restore sacrificial worship. The Israeli government has not responded favorably. Most Orthodox Jews regard rebuilding a Temple as an activity for a Jewish Messiah as part of a future [[Jewish eschatology]], and most non-Orthodox Jews do not believe in the restoration of sacrificial worship at all. The Temple Institute has been constructing ritual objects in preparation for a resumption of sacrifices.\n\n==View among modern Jewish denominations==\n\n===Contemporary Orthodox Judaism===\nToday Orthodox Judaism includes mention of each korban on either a daily basis in the ''[[siddur]]'' (daily prayer book), or in the ''[[machzor]]'' (holiday prayerbook) as part of the prayers for the relevant days concerned. They are also referred to in the prayerbooks of Conservative Judaism, in an abbreviated fashion.\n\nOn each Jewish holiday the sections in the Torah mentioning that festival's korbanot is read out loud in [[synagogue]].\n\n====Daily services====\nIn the very early morning daily ''[[Shacharit]]'' prayers for example, they include the following in order of mention, actually called the korbanot. The following example is taken from the [[Nusach Ashkenaz]].\n* ''Kiyor'' Describing the basin containing pure water to wash up before touching the korbanot (offerings), based on Exodus 30: 17-21.<ref name=\"bible.ort.org\">http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=30</ref>\n* ''Trumat Hadeshen'' Removing the ashes of the ''korban olah'' (elevation offering), based on Leviticus 6:1-6.<ref>http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=6</ref>\n* ''korban Tamid'' Perpetual daily offerings: \"...Fire-offering...male yearling [[sheep|lambs]] unblemished two a day...\" based on Numbers 28:1-8.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=4&CHAPTER=28</ref>\n* ''Ketoret'' [[Incense]] [from] [[spice]]s: \"...stacte, onycha, and galbanum, ...and [[frankincense]]...\" Based on Exodus 30:34-36;7-8...<ref name=\"bible.ort.org\"/>\"[[myrrh]], [[Cinnamomum cassia|cassia]], [[spikenard]], [[saffron]], costus, aromatic bark, [[cinnamon]], ley, [[salt]], [[amber]]...\" based on the Babylonian [[Talmud]] ''Kritut'' 6a; Jerusalem Talmud ''Yoma'' 4:5; 33a.\n* ''korban Musaf'' The additional offerings for [[Shabbat]]: \"On the Sabbath...two male lambs...fine [[flour]] for a meal offering mixed with oil and its [[wine]] libation...\" based on Numbers 28:9-10.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* ''korban Rosh Chodesh'' Offering for the new month: ...Two young [[bull]]s, one [[Sheep|ram]], seven lambs...fine flour ...mixed with [[olive oil]]...one he [[goat]]... and its wine libation.\" Based on Numbers 28: 11-15.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* ''Zevachim'' Chapter 5 of [[Mishnah]] ''Zevachim'' is then cited. (It was included in the ''siddur'' at this stage because it discusses all the sacrifices and the sages do not dispute within it):\n**A. ''Eizehu mekoman shel z'vachim'' Places for the ''zevachim korbanot'' to be offered: \"...The slaughter of the bull and the he-goat of Yom Kippur is in the north [of the altar]...\"\n**B. ''Parim hanisrafim'' [[Bull]]s that are completely burned: \"...These are burned in the place where the [altar] ashes are deposited.\"\n**C. ''Chatot hatzibur v'hayachid'' Sin offerings of the community and the individual: \"...The he-goats...are eaten within the [Temple courtyard] curtains by male priests...until midnight.\"\n**D. ''Ha'olah qodesh qodashim'' The elevation offering is among the offerings with a major-degree-of-holiness: \"...it is entirely consumed by fire.\"\n**E. ''Zivchei shalmei tzibur v'ashamot'' Communal peace offerings and guilt offerings: \"...are eaten within the [Temple courtyard] by males of the priesthood...until midnight.\"\n**F. ''Hatodah v'eil nazir qodashim kalim'' The thanksgiving offering and the ram of a Nazirite are offerings of a minor-degree holiness: \"They are eaten throughout the city [of Jerusalem] by anyone, prepared in any manner...until midnight...\"\n**G. ''Sh'lamim qodashim kalim'' The peace offerings are of lesser (lighter) holiness:  \"...Is eaten by the ''kohanim''...throughout the city [of Jerusalem] by anyone...\"\n**H. ''Hab'chor vehama'aser vehapesach qodashim kalim'' The firstborn and tithe of animals and the Passover offering are offerings of lesser (lighter) holiness: \"...The Passover offering is eaten only at night...only if roasted.\"\n* ''Rabbi Yishmael omer'' Rabbi Yishmael says: Through thirteen rules is the Torah elucidated. (Introduction to the ''Sifra'', part of the Oral Law).\n* ''Yehi Ratzon'' (Ending) The study session concludes with a prayer (\"May it be thy will...) for the restoration of the Temple in Jerusalem and the resumption of sacrifices. (...that the Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant our portion in your Torah and there we shall serve you with reverence as in days of old and in former years. And may the grain offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing to God, as in days of old and in former years.\")\n\nThe [[Amidah]]\n* ''Retzai'' Every the Orthodox [[Amidah]], the central prayer of Jewish services, contains the paragraph: \"Be favorable, Oh Lord our God, to your people Israel and their prayer, and restore the service of the [[Holy of Holies]] of Your House, and accept the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer with love and favor, and may the service of your people Israel always be favored.\" Conservative Judaism removes the fire-offerings clause from this prayer.\n* ''Yehi Ratzon'' Private recitiation of the Amidah traditionally ends with the ''Yehi Ratzon'' prayer for the restoration of the Temple.\n* The Amidah itself is said to represent liturgically the ''purpose'' of the daily korban, while the recitation of the korbanot sections fulfill the ''formal responsibility'' to perform them, in the absence of the Temple.\n\nThe weekday [[Torah reading]]\n* A set of blessings connected with the weekday Torah reading include a prayer for the [[Third Temple|restoration of the Temple]]: \"May it be the will before our Father who is in heaven to establish the House of our lives and to return his [[Shekhinah]]'' into our midst, speedily, in our days, and let us say Amen.\"\n\n===In Conservative Judaism===\nConservative Judaism disavows the resumption of qorbanot. Consistent with this view, it has deleted prayers for the resumption of sacrifices from the Conservative ''siddur'', including both the morning study section from the sacrifices, prayers for the restoration of qorbanot in the Amidah, and various mentions elsewhere. Consistent with its view that a priesthood and sacrificial system will not be restored, Conservative Judaism has also lifted certain restrictions on ''kohanim'', including limitations on marriage prohibiting marrying a divorced woman or a convert. Conservative Judaism does, however, believe in the restoration of a Temple in some form, and in the continuation of kohanim and [[Levites]] under relaxed requirements, and has retained references to both in its prayer books. Consistent with its stress on the continuity of tradition, many Conservative synagogues have also retained references to [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|Festival]] qorbanot, changing all references to sacrifices into the past tense (e.g. the Orthodox \"and there we will sacrifice\" is changed to \"and there they sacrificed\"). Some more liberal Conservative synagogues, however, have removed all references to sacrifices, past or present, from the prayer service. The most recent official Conservative prayer book, [[Sim Shalom]], provides both service alternatives.\n\n===In Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism===\n[[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] disavow all belief in a restoration of a Temple, the resumption of qorbanot, or the continuation of identified Cohens or Levites. These branches of Judaism believe that all such practices represent ancient practices inconsistent with the requirements of modernity, and have removed all or virtually all references to qorbanot from their prayer books.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Corban}}\n* [[Abomination (Judaism)]]\n* [[Du\u0161ni Brav]]\n* [[Hakarat HaTov]]\n* [[Holy Qurbana]]\n* [[Incense offering]]\n* [[Kourbania]]\n* [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)]]\n* [[Psalm 100]]\n* [[Qurbani]]\n* [[Red heifer]]\n* [[Wave offering]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[J.

By the [[Second Temple period]], Hellenistic Jewish texts use korban specifically to mean a vow. The New Testament preserves korban once as a transliterated loan-word for a vow, once also a related noun, ''\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c2'' \"[[temple treasury]]\", otherwise using ''\u03b4\u1ff6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd'', ''\u03b8\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1'' or ''\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac'' and other terms drawn from the [[Septuagint]].

Sins in Judaism consist of different grades of severity:<ref name=\"JE.SIN\"/>\n* The lightest is the ''\u1e25e\u1e6d'', ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6da'ah'', or ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6dat''  (lit. \"fault,\" \"shortcoming,\" \"misstep\"), an infraction of a commandment committed in ignorance of the existence or meaning of that command.\n* The second kind is the ''awon'', a breach of a minor commandment committed with a full knowledge of the existence and nature of that commandment (''bemezid''). \n* The gravest kind is the ''pesha'' or ''mered'', a presumptuous and rebellious act against God. Its worst form is the ''resha'', such an act committed with a wicked intention.\nThese three terms are mentioned by the Psalmist (cvi. 6): \"We have sinned [''\u1e25a\u1e6da'nu''], . . . we have committed iniquity [''he-'ewinu''], we have done wickedly [''hirsha'nu]''\" (comp.

Women could offer the sacrifice and hold a [[Passover Seder]] themselves if they wished, even if married.\n* [[Sin offering]]s or [[guilt offering]]s in atonement for transgressions and unintentional errors.\n* Offerings relevant to fulfillment of, or transgression of, the [[Nazirite]] vow.\n* Offerings following cure from certain diseases and unusual bodily discharges.\n\nWomen could also voluntarily participate in a number of other offerings and rituals for which they were not obligated, including:{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n* [[First Fruits]] on the holiday of [[Shavuot]].\n* [[Temple tax]] - The half-[[shekel]] tax for Temple needs.\n* Voluntary offerings, [[peace offering]]s and a variety of other voluntary and donative offerings.\n* ''[[Semicha in sacrifices|Semicha]]'' (laying on hands) of sacrificial animals for sacrifices they were not required to perform (Berachot 19a).\n* Women could slaughter their sacrificial animals themselves if they wished.\n\n===In the Nevi'im===\nMany books of the [[Nevi'im]] section of the [[Hebrew Bible]] such as the [[Book of Isaiah]] and [[Book of Jeremiah]] spoke out against those Israelites who brought forth sacrifices but did not act in accord with the precepts of the Law. The Prophets disparaged sacrifices that were offered without a regeneration of the heart, i.e., a determined turning from sin and returning to God by striving after righteousness ([[Book of Hosea]] 14:1-2, Joel 2:13, Micah 6:6-8). At the same time, prophets stressed the importance of offerings combined with justice and good even as they taught that offerings were unacceptable unless combined with heartfelt repentance and good deeds. [[Malachi]], the last prophet in the Hebrew Bible, emphasized that the goal of repentance is not to end sacrifices, but to make the offerings fit for acceptance once again ([[Book of Malachi]], 3:3-4). Similarly, the [[Book of Isaiah]] despite disparagement of sacrifices without justice, portrays sacrifice as having a role complementary with prayer in a universalistic [[eschatology]] (Isaiah 56:1; 6-7).\n\n==Rabbinical interpretation==\n\n===100 among the 613 commandments===\nAccording to [[Maimonides]], about one hundred of the permanent [[613 commandments]] based on the Torah, by rabbinical enumeration, directly concern sacrifices, excluding those commandments that concern the actual Temple and the priests themselves of which there are about another fifty.<ref>\n# Not to burn anything on the Golden Altar besides incense (Exodus 30:9)\n# To offer only unblemished animals (Leviticus 22:21)\n# Not to dedicate a blemished animal for the altar (Leviticus 22:20)\n# Not to slaughter it (Leviticus 22:22)\n# Not to sprinkle its blood (Leviticus 22:24)\n# Not to burn its ''[[Chelev|khelev]]'' (Leviticus 22:22)\n# Not to offer a temporarily blemished animal (Deuteronomy 17:1)\n# Not to sacrifice blemished animals even if offered by non-Jews (Leviticus 22:25)\n# Not to inflict wounds upon dedicated animals (Leviticus 22:21)\n# To redeem dedicated animals which have become disqualified (Deuteronomy 12:15)\n# To offer only animals which are at least eight days old (Leviticus 22:27)\n# Not to offer animals bought with the wages of a harlot or the animal exchanged for a dog (Deuteronomy 23:19)\n# Not to burn honey or yeast on the altar (Leviticus 2:11)\n# To salt all sacrifices (Leviticus 2:13)\n# Not to omit the salt from sacrifices (Leviticus 2:13)\n# Carry out the procedure of the burnt offering as prescribed in the Torah (Leviticus 1:3)\n# Not to eat its meat (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# Carry out the procedure of the sin offering (Leviticus 6:18)\n# Not to eat the meat of the inner sin offering (Leviticus 6:23)\n# Not to decapitate a fowl brought as a sin offering (Leviticus 5:8)\n# Carry out the procedure of the guilt offering (Leviticus 7:1)\n# The ''kohanim'' must eat the sacrificial meat in the Temple (Exodus 29:33)\n# The ''kohanim'' must not eat the meat outside the Temple courtyard (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# A non-''kohen'' must not eat sacrificial meat (Exodus 29:33)\n# To follow the procedure of the peace offering (Leviticus 7:11)\n# Not to eat the meat of minor sacrifices before sprinkling the blood (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# To bring meal offerings as prescribed in the Torah (Leviticus 2:1)\n# Not to put oil on the meal offerings of wrongdoers (Leviticus 5:11)\n# Not to put frankincense on the meal offerings of wrongdoers (Leviticus 3:11)\n# Not to eat the meal offering of the High Priest (Leviticus 6:16)\n# Not to bake a meal offering as leavened bread (Leviticus 6:10)\n# The ''kohanim'' must eat the remains of the meal offerings (Leviticus 6:9)\n# To bring all avowed and freewill offerings to the Temple on the first subsequent festival (Deuteronomy 12:5-6)\n# To offer all sacrifices in the Temple (Deuteronomy 12:11)\n# To bring all sacrifices from outside Israel to the Temple (Deuteronomy 12:26)\n# Not to slaughter sacrifices outside the courtyard (of the Temple) (Leviticus 17:4)\n# Not to offer any sacrifices outside the courtyard (of the Temple) (Deuteronomy 12:13)\n# To offer two lambs every day (Numbers 28:3)\n# To light a fire on the altar every day (Leviticus 6:6)\n# Not to extinguish this fire (Leviticus 6:6)\n# To remove the ashes from the altar every day (Leviticus 6:3)\n# To burn incense every day (Exodus 30:7)\n# The ''Kohen Gadol'' must bring a meal offering every day (Leviticus 6:13)\n# To bring two additional lambs as burnt offerings on Shabbat (Numbers 28:9)\n# To bring additional offerings on the New Month (''[[Rosh Khodesh]]'') (Numbers 28:11)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Passover]] (Numbers 28:19)\n# To offer the wave offering from the meal of the new wheat (Leviticus 23:10)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Shavuot]] (Numbers 28:26)\n# To bring two leaves to accompany the above sacrifice (Leviticus 23:17)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Rosh Hashana]] (Numbers 29:2)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Yom Kippur]] (Numbers 29:8)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Sukkot]] (Numbers 29:13)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Shmini Atzeret]] (Numbers 29:35)\n# Not to eat sacrifices which have become unfit or blemished (Deuteronomy 14:3)\n# Not to eat from sacrifices offered with improper intentions (Leviticus 7:18)\n# Not to leave sacrifices past the time allowed for eating them (Leviticus 22:30)\n# Not to eat from that which was left over (Leviticus 19:8)\n# Not to eat from sacrifices which became impure (Leviticus 7:19)\n# An impure person must not eat from sacrifices (Leviticus 7:20)\n# To burn the leftover sacrifices (Leviticus 7:17)\n# To burn all impure sacrifices (Leviticus 7:19)\n# To follow the [sacrificial] procedure of Yom Kippur in the sequence prescribed in ''Parshah [[Acharei]] Mot'' (After the death of [[Aaron]]'s sons...)

In addition, large parts of every other book of the Talmud discuss various kinds of sacrifices. ''Pesachim'' is largely devoted to a discussion of how to offer the [[Passover sacrifice]]. ''Yoma'' contains a detailed discussion of the offerings and Temple ritual on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), and there are sections in ''seder Moed'' (Festivals) for the special offerings and Temple ritual for other major Jewish holidays. ''Sheqalim'' discusses the annual half-shekel offering for Temple maintenance and Temple governance and management, ''Nashim'' discusses the offerings made by [[Nazirite]]s and the suspected adultress, etc.\n\nThe Talmud provides extensive details not only on how to perform sacrifices but how to adjudicate difficult cases, such what to do if a mistake was made and whether improperly performing one of the required ritual elements invalidates it or not. The Talmud explains how to roast the Passover offering, how to dash blood from different kinds of sacrifices upon the altar, how to prepare the incense, the regulatory code for the system of taxation that financed the priesthood and public sacrifices, and numerous other details.\n\n===Rationale and rabbinic commentary===\n[[Maimonides]], a medieval Jewish scholar, drew on the early critiques of the need for sacrifice, taking the view that God always held sacrifice inferior to prayer and philosophical meditation. However, God understood that the Israelites were used to the animal sacrifices that the surrounding pagan tribes used as the primary way to commune with their gods. As such, in Maimonides' view, it was only natural that Israelites would believe that sacrifice would be a necessary part of the relationship between God and man. Maimonides concludes that God's decision to allow sacrifices was a concession to human psychological limitations. It would have been too much to have expected the Israelites to leap from pagan worship to prayer and meditation in one step. In ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', he writes:\n{{quote|But the custom which was in those days general among men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted in sacrificing animals... It was in accordance with the wisdom and plan of God...that God did not command us to give up and to discontinue all these manners of service. For to obey such a commandment would have been contrary to the nature of man, who generally cleaves to that to which he is used; it would in those days have made the same impression as a prophet would make at present [the 12th Century] if he called us to the service of God and told us in His name, that we should not pray to God nor fast, nor seek His help in time of trouble; that we should serve Him in thought, and not by any action.<ref>Book III, Chapter 32. Translated by M. Friedlander, 1904, ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Dover Publications, 1956 edition</ref>}}\n\nIn contrast, many others such as [[Nahmanides]] (in his commentary on Leviticus 1:9) disagreed. Nahmanides cites the fact that the Torah records the practices of animal and other sacrifices from the times of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]] and earlier. Indeed, the purpose of recounting the [[Binding of Isaac|near sacrifice of Isaac]] was to illustrate the sublime significance and need of animal sacrifices as supplanting the abomination of human sacrifices.\n\n===In spiritual practice===\nThe korban also has a spiritual meaning, and refers to some part of an individual's ego, which is given up as a sacrifice to God in honor of the mortality of the worshipper. In keeping with the root of the word, meaning to draw close, and to the common usage as the sacrifice of an animal, so too can the worshipper sacrifice something of this world in order to become closer to God.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =  Dubov\n  | first =  Nissan Dovid \n  | title = Jewish Meditation\n  | publisher =Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center\n  | url = http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=361886\n  | accessdate =  2006-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==The end of sacrifices==\nWith the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans, the Jewish practice of offering korbanot stopped for all intents and purposes. Despite subsequent intermittent periods of small Jewish groups offering the traditional sacrifices on the Temple Mount, the practice effectively ended.\n\n[[Rabbinic Judaism]] was forced to undergo a significant development in response to this change; no longer could Judaism revolve around the Temple services. The destruction of the Temple led to a development of Judaism in the direction of text study, prayer, and personal observance. [[Orthodox Judaism]] regards this as being largely an alternative way of fulfilling the obligations of the Temple. Other branches of Judaism ([[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]]) regard the korbanot as an ancient ritual that will not return. A range of responses is recorded in classical rabbinic literature, describing this subject.\n\n:Once, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai was walking with his disciple, Rabbi Y'hoshua, near Jerusalem after the destruction of the Temple. Rabbi Y'hoshua looked at the Temple ruins and said \"Alas for us!! The place that atoned for the sins of the people Israel lies in ruins!\" Then Rabbi Yohannan ben Zakkai spoke to him these words of comfort:  'Be not grieved, my son. There is another equally meritorious way of gaining ritual atonement, even though the Temple is destroyed. We can still gain ritual atonement through deeds of loving-kindness. For it is written \"Loving kindness I desire, not sacrifice.\" (Hosea 6:6)\n:[[Midrash]] Avot D'Rabbi Nathan 4:5\n\nIn the [[Babylonian Talmud]], a number of sages opined that following Jewish law, doing charitable deeds, and studying Jewish texts is greater than performing animal sacrifices.\n\n:Rabbi Elazar said: Doing righteous deeds of charity is greater than offering all of the sacrifices, as it is written: \"Doing charity and justice is more desirable to the Lord than sacrifice\" (Proverbs 21:3).\n:Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 49\n\nNonetheless, numerous texts of the Talmud stress the importance of and hope for eventual re-introduction of sacrifices, and regard their loss as a terrible tragedy. Partaking of sacrificial offerings was compared to eating directly at one's Father's table, whose loss synagogue worship does not quite entirely replace. One example is in ''Berachot'':\n:And I said to him: I heard a heavenly voice that was cooing like a dove and saying, \"Woe to the children because of whose sins I destroyed My house, and burned My temple, and exiled them among the nations of the world. And he [Elijah the prophet] said to me: \"By your life and the life of your head! It is not only at this moment that [the heavenly voice] says this. But on each and every day it says this three times. And not only this, but at the time that the people of Israel enter the synagogues and houses of study, and respond (in the [[Kaddish]]) \"May His great name be blessed\", the Holy One, Blessed is He, shakes His head and says: \"Fortunate for the king who is praised this way in his house. What is there for the Father who has exiled His children. And woe to the children who have been exiled from their Father's table.\"  (Talmud ''Berachot'' 3a).\n\nAnother example is in ''Sheqalim'':\n:Rabbi Akiva said: Shimon Ben Loga related the following to me: I was once collecting grasses, and I saw a child from the [[House of Avitnas]] (the incense-makers). And I saw that he cried, and I saw that he laughed. I said to him, \"My son, why did you cry?\" He said, Because of the glory of my Father's house that has decreased.\" I asked \"And why did you laugh?\" He said to me \"Because of the glory prepared for the righteous in the future.\" I asked \"And what did you see?\" [that brought on these emotions]. \"The herb ''[[Maaleh Ashan|maaleh ashan]]'' is growing next to me. [''Maaleh Ashan'' is the secret ingredient in the incense that made the smoke rise, which according to the Talmud the [[House of Avitnas]] never revealed.]\"\n\n===Liturgical attention to end of sacrifices===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nNumerous details of the daily religious practice of an ordinary Jew are connected to keeping memory of the rhythm of the life of the Temple and its sacrifices. For example, the Mishna begins with a statement that the [[Shema Yisrael]] prayer is to be recited in the evening at the time when Kohanim who were ''[[Tumah and taharah|tamei]]'' (ritually impure) are permitted to enter to eat their [[heave offering]] (a food-tithe given to priests) following purification. A detailed discussion of the obligations of tithing, ritual purity, and other elements central to the Temple and priesthood is required in order to determine the meaning of this contemporary daily Jewish obligation.\n\n===Other occasions===\nJewish services for [[Shabbat]], Jewish holidays and other occasions include special prayers for the restoration of sacrifices. For example, the traditional Yom Kippur liturgy contains repeated prayers for the restoration of sacrifices and every [[High Holiday]] [[Amidah]] contains [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 56:7:\n:Even them will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon Mine altar; for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.<ref name=\"mechon-mamre.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1056.htm|title=Isaiah 56 / Hebrew - English Bible / Mechon-Mamre|website=www.mechon-mamre.org}}</ref>\n\n==Modern view and resumption of sacrifices==\n\n===Future of sacrifices in Judaism===\n{{see also| Temple in Jerusalem}}\nThe prevailing belief among rabbinic Jews is that in the [[Messianic Age|messianic era]], the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]] will come and a [[Third Temple]] will be built. It is believed that the korbanot will be reinstituted, but to what extent and for how long is unknown. Some biblical and classical rabbinic sources hold that most or all sacrifices will not need to be offered.\n\n* In the future all sacrifices, with the exception of the Thanksgiving-sacrifice, will be discontinued. (Midrash Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)\n* All sacrifices will be annulled in the future. (Tanchuma Emor 14, Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)\n* Then the grain-offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to God as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. (Malachi 3:4)\n* It is impossible to go suddenly from one extreme to the other;...the custom which was in those days general among all men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted of sacrificing animals in the temples... For this reason God allowed this kind of service to continue.  The sacrificial system is not the primary object, rather supplications, and prayer. (Maimonides, The Guide to the Perplexed III 32)\n\nThe majority view of classical rabbis is that the Torah's commandments will still be applicable and in force during the messianic era. However, a significant minority of rabbis held that most of the commandments will be nullified in the messianic era, thus holding that sacrifices will not be reinstated. Examples of such rabbinic views include:\n* Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Niddah 61b and Tractate Shabbat 151b.\n* Midrash Shochar Tov (Mizmor 146:5) states that God will permit what is now forbidden.\n\n[[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that in the messianic era, most or all of the korbanot will be reinstituted, at least for a time. [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]], hold that no animal sacrifices will be offered in a rebuilt Temple at all, following the position of Tanchuma Emor 14 and Vayikra Rabbah 9:7.\n\n===Nineteenth and twentieth century===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nIn the 1800s a number of Orthodox rabbis studied the idea of reinstating korbanot on the Temple Mount, even though the messianic era had not yet arrived and the Temple was not rebuilt. A number of [[responsa]] concluded that within certain parameters, it is permissible according to Jewish law to offer such sacrifices.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, [[Israel Meir Kagan]] advised some followers to set up special ''[[yeshiva]]s'' for married students known as ''Qodshim [[Kolel]]im'' that would specialize in the study of the korbanot and study with greater intensity the ''qodshim'' sections of the [[Talmud]] in order to prepare for the arrival of the Jewish Messiah who would oversee the rebuilding of the original Temple of Solomon in [[Jerusalem]] that would be known as the [[Third Temple]]. His advice was taken seriously and today there are a number of well-established [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] institutions in [[Israel]] that focus solely on the subject of the korbanot, ''qodshim'', and the needs of the future Jewish Temple, such as the [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty]].\n\n===Efforts to restore korbanot===\n{{Main|The Third Temple}}\nA few groups, notably the [[Temple Institute]] and the [[Temple Mount Faithful]], have petitioned the Israeli government to rebuild a Third Temple on the [[Temple Mount]] and restore sacrificial worship. The Israeli government has not responded favorably. Most Orthodox Jews regard rebuilding a Temple as an activity for a Jewish Messiah as part of a future [[Jewish eschatology]], and most non-Orthodox Jews do not believe in the restoration of sacrificial worship at all. The Temple Institute has been constructing ritual objects in preparation for a resumption of sacrifices.\n\n==View among modern Jewish denominations==\n\n===Contemporary Orthodox Judaism===\nToday Orthodox Judaism includes mention of each korban on either a daily basis in the ''[[siddur]]'' (daily prayer book), or in the ''[[machzor]]'' (holiday prayerbook) as part of the prayers for the relevant days concerned. They are also referred to in the prayerbooks of Conservative Judaism, in an abbreviated fashion.\n\nOn each Jewish holiday the sections in the Torah mentioning that festival's korbanot is read out loud in [[synagogue]].\n\n====Daily services====\nIn the very early morning daily ''[[Shacharit]]'' prayers for example, they include the following in order of mention, actually called the korbanot. The following example is taken from the [[Nusach Ashkenaz]].\n* ''Kiyor'' Describing the basin containing pure water to wash up before touching the korbanot (offerings), based on Exodus 30: 17-21.<ref name=\"bible.ort.org\">http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=30</ref>\n* ''Trumat Hadeshen'' Removing the ashes of the ''korban olah'' (elevation offering), based on Leviticus 6:1-6.<ref>http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=6</ref>\n* ''korban Tamid'' Perpetual daily offerings: \"...Fire-offering...male yearling [[sheep|lambs]] unblemished two a day...\" based on Numbers 28:1-8.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=4&CHAPTER=28</ref>\n* ''Ketoret'' [[Incense]] [from] [[spice]]s: \"...stacte, onycha, and galbanum, ...and [[frankincense]]...\" Based on Exodus 30:34-36;7-8...<ref name=\"bible.ort.org\"/>\"[[myrrh]], [[Cinnamomum cassia|cassia]], [[spikenard]], [[saffron]], costus, aromatic bark, [[cinnamon]], ley, [[salt]], [[amber]]...\" based on the Babylonian [[Talmud]] ''Kritut'' 6a; Jerusalem Talmud ''Yoma'' 4:5; 33a.\n* ''korban Musaf'' The additional offerings for [[Shabbat]]: \"On the Sabbath...two male lambs...fine [[flour]] for a meal offering mixed with oil and its [[wine]] libation...\" based on Numbers 28:9-10.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* ''korban Rosh Chodesh'' Offering for the new month: ...Two young [[bull]]s, one [[Sheep|ram]], seven lambs...fine flour ...mixed with [[olive oil]]...one he [[goat]]... and its wine libation.\" Based on Numbers 28: 11-15.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* ''Zevachim'' Chapter 5 of [[Mishnah]] ''Zevachim'' is then cited. (It was included in the ''siddur'' at this stage because it discusses all the sacrifices and the sages do not dispute within it):\n**A. ''Eizehu mekoman shel z'vachim'' Places for the ''zevachim korbanot'' to be offered: \"...The slaughter of the bull and the he-goat of Yom Kippur is in the north [of the altar]...\"\n**B. ''Parim hanisrafim'' [[Bull]]s that are completely burned: \"...These are burned in the place where the [altar] ashes are deposited.\"\n**C. ''Chatot hatzibur v'hayachid'' Sin offerings of the community and the individual: \"...The he-goats...are eaten within the [Temple courtyard] curtains by male priests...until midnight.\"\n**D. ''Ha'olah qodesh qodashim'' The elevation offering is among the offerings with a major-degree-of-holiness: \"...it is entirely consumed by fire.\"\n**E. ''Zivchei shalmei tzibur v'ashamot'' Communal peace offerings and guilt offerings: \"...are eaten within the [Temple courtyard] by males of the priesthood...until midnight.\"\n**F. ''Hatodah v'eil nazir qodashim kalim'' The thanksgiving offering and the ram of a Nazirite are offerings of a minor-degree holiness: \"They are eaten throughout the city [of Jerusalem] by anyone, prepared in any manner...until midnight...\"\n**G. ''Sh'lamim qodashim kalim'' The peace offerings are of lesser (lighter) holiness:  \"...Is eaten by the ''kohanim''...throughout the city [of Jerusalem] by anyone...\"\n**H. ''Hab'chor vehama'aser vehapesach qodashim kalim'' The firstborn and tithe of animals and the Passover offering are offerings of lesser (lighter) holiness: \"...The Passover offering is eaten only at night...only if roasted.\"\n* ''Rabbi Yishmael omer'' Rabbi Yishmael says: Through thirteen rules is the Torah elucidated. (Introduction to the ''Sifra'', part of the Oral Law).\n* ''Yehi Ratzon'' (Ending) The study session concludes with a prayer (\"May it be thy will...) for the restoration of the Temple in Jerusalem and the resumption of sacrifices. (...that the Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant our portion in your Torah and there we shall serve you with reverence as in days of old and in former years. And may the grain offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing to God, as in days of old and in former years.\")\n\nThe [[Amidah]]\n* ''Retzai'' Every the Orthodox [[Amidah]], the central prayer of Jewish services, contains the paragraph: \"Be favorable, Oh Lord our God, to your people Israel and their prayer, and restore the service of the [[Holy of Holies]] of Your House, and accept the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer with love and favor, and may the service of your people Israel always be favored.\" Conservative Judaism removes the fire-offerings clause from this prayer.\n* ''Yehi Ratzon'' Private recitiation of the Amidah traditionally ends with the ''Yehi Ratzon'' prayer for the restoration of the Temple.\n* The Amidah itself is said to represent liturgically the ''purpose'' of the daily korban, while the recitation of the korbanot sections fulfill the ''formal responsibility'' to perform them, in the absence of the Temple.\n\nThe weekday [[Torah reading]]\n* A set of blessings connected with the weekday Torah reading include a prayer for the [[Third Temple|restoration of the Temple]]: \"May it be the will before our Father who is in heaven to establish the House of our lives and to return his [[Shekhinah]]'' into our midst, speedily, in our days, and let us say Amen.\"\n\n===In Conservative Judaism===\nConservative Judaism disavows the resumption of qorbanot. Consistent with this view, it has deleted prayers for the resumption of sacrifices from the Conservative ''siddur'', including both the morning study section from the sacrifices, prayers for the restoration of qorbanot in the Amidah, and various mentions elsewhere. Consistent with its view that a priesthood and sacrificial system will not be restored, Conservative Judaism has also lifted certain restrictions on ''kohanim'', including limitations on marriage prohibiting marrying a divorced woman or a convert. Conservative Judaism does, however, believe in the restoration of a Temple in some form, and in the continuation of kohanim and [[Levites]] under relaxed requirements, and has retained references to both in its prayer books. Consistent with its stress on the continuity of tradition, many Conservative synagogues have also retained references to [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|Festival]] qorbanot, changing all references to sacrifices into the past tense (e.g. the Orthodox \"and there we will sacrifice\" is changed to \"and there they sacrificed\"). Some more liberal Conservative synagogues, however, have removed all references to sacrifices, past or present, from the prayer service. The most recent official Conservative prayer book, [[Sim Shalom]], provides both service alternatives.\n\n===In Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism===\n[[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] disavow all belief in a restoration of a Temple, the resumption of qorbanot, or the continuation of identified Cohens or Levites. These branches of Judaism believe that all such practices represent ancient practices inconsistent with the requirements of modernity, and have removed all or virtually all references to qorbanot from their prayer books.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Corban}}\n* [[Abomination (Judaism)]]\n* [[Du\u0161ni Brav]]\n* [[Hakarat HaTov]]\n* [[Holy Qurbana]]\n* [[Incense offering]]\n* [[Kourbania]]\n* [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)]]\n* [[Psalm 100]]\n* [[Qurbani]]\n* [[Red heifer]]\n* [[Wave offering]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[J.

Unlike diesel-electric locomotives of similar high tractive effort (for starting heavy trains) but typical for a steam locomotive, it could easily run at 70 miles per hour (113&nbsp;km/h) and more.\n\n==Operational history==\nNorfolk and Western used No. 1218 and the other class A locomotives primarily for fast freight trains, but they also pulled heavy coal trains on the flatter districts of the Norfolk & Western system, and reportedly even pulled heavy passenger trains at times.\n\nIn 1959, when the 1218 was retired, it was purchased by the [[Union Carbide|Union Carbide Co.]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia]], where it was used as a stationary boiler at a chemical plant.<ref name=\"Wrinn2000pp73-74\">{{Harvp|Wrinn|2000|pp=73-74}}.</ref> In 1965, No. 1218 was repurchased by [[New England]] millionaire [[F.

Unlike diesel-electric locomotives of similar high tractive effort (for starting heavy trains) but typical for a steam locomotive, it could easily run at 70 miles per hour (113&nbsp;km/h) and more.\n\n==Operational history==\nNorfolk and Western used No. 1218 and the other class A locomotives primarily for fast freight trains, but they also pulled heavy coal trains on the flatter districts of the Norfolk & Western system, and reportedly even pulled heavy passenger trains at times.\n\nIn 1959, when the 1218 was retired, it was purchased by the [[Union Carbide|Union Carbide Co.]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia]], where it was used as a stationary boiler at a chemical plant.<ref name=\"Wrinn2000pp73-74\">{{Harvp|Wrinn|2000|pp=73-74}}.</ref> In 1965, No. 1218 was repurchased by [[New England]] millionaire [[F.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons of the show are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, but generally, most episodes feature four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, with the audience and panelists voting for their favorite.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs.

It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively.
