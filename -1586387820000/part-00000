Though this is a different approach from other Hindu sects, they believe it to be effective. They are infamously known for their rituals that include such as ''shava samskara or [[shava sadhana]]'' (ritual worship incorporating the use of a corpse as the altar) to invoke the mother goddess in her form as Smashan [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]] (Tara of the Cremation Grounds).\n\nIn Hindu iconography, Tara, like [[Kali]], is one of the ten [[Mahavidya]]s (wisdom goddesses) and once invoked can bless the Aghori with supernatural powers. The most popular of the ten Mahavidyas who are worshiped by Aghoris are [[Dhumavati]], [[Bagalamukhi]], and [[Bhairavi]]. The male Hindu deities primarily worshiped by Aghoris for supernatural powers are manifestations of [[Shiva]], including [[Mah\u0101k\u0101la]], [[Bhairava]], [[Virabhadra]], [[Avadhuti]], and others.\n\nBarrett (2008: p.&nbsp;161) discusses the \"[[charnel ground]] s\u0101dhan\u0101\" of the Aghora in both its left and right-handed proclivities and identifies it as principally cutting through attachments and aversion and foregrounding primordiality; a view uncultured, undomesticated:\n{{quote|The gurus and disciples of Aghor believe their state to be primordial and universal. They believe that all human beings are natural-born Aghori. Hari Baba has said on several occasions that human babies of all societies are without discrimination, that they will play as much in their own filth as with the toys around them. Children become progressively discriminating as they grow older and learn the culturally specific attachments and aversions of their parents. Children become increasingly aware of their mortality as they bump their heads and fall to the ground. They come to fear their mortality and then palliate this fear by finding ways to deny it altogether.<ref name=\"uni-koeln\">'Aghora' in ''Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary'' [Online].

When this s\u0101dhan\u0101 takes the form of charnel ground s\u0101dhan\u0101, the Aghori faces death as a very young child, simultaneously meditating on the totality of life at its two extremes.

Apart from this, any cremation ground would be a holy place for an Aghori ascetic. The cremation grounds near the [[Shakti Pitha|yoni pithas]], 51 holy centres for worship of the Hindu [[Mother Goddess]] scattered across South Asia and the Himalayan terrain, are key locations preferred for performing [[sadhana]] by the Aghoris. They are also known to meditate and perform [[sadhana]] in haunted houses.\n\n==Medicine==\nAghori practice healing through purification as a pillar of their ritual.

They are infamously known for their rituals that include such as ''shava samskara or [[shava sadhana]]'' (ritual worship incorporating the use of a corpse as the altar) to invoke the mother goddess in her form as Smashan [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]] (Tara of the Cremation Grounds).\n\nIn Hindu iconography, Tara, like [[Kali]], is one of the ten [[Mahavidya]]s (wisdom goddesses) and once invoked can bless the Aghori with supernatural powers. The most popular of the ten Mahavidyas who are worshiped by Aghoris are [[Dhumavati]], [[Bagalamukhi]], and [[Bhairavi]]. The male Hindu deities primarily worshiped by Aghoris for supernatural powers are manifestations of [[Shiva]], including [[Mah\u0101k\u0101la]], [[Bhairava]], [[Virabhadra]], [[Avadhuti]], and others.\n\nBarrett (2008: p.&nbsp;161) discusses the \"[[charnel ground]] s\u0101dhan\u0101\" of the Aghora in both its left and right-handed proclivities and identifies it as principally cutting through attachments and aversion and foregrounding primordiality; a view uncultured, undomesticated:\n{{quote|The gurus and disciples of Aghor believe their state to be primordial and universal. They believe that all human beings are natural-born Aghori. Hari Baba has said on several occasions that human babies of all societies are without discrimination, that they will play as much in their own filth as with the toys around them. Children become progressively discriminating as they grow older and learn the culturally specific attachments and aversions of their parents. Children become increasingly aware of their mortality as they bump their heads and fall to the ground. They come to fear their mortality and then palliate this fear by finding ways to deny it altogether.<ref name=\"uni-koeln\">'Aghora' in ''Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary'' [Online].

When this s\u0101dhan\u0101 takes the form of charnel ground s\u0101dhan\u0101, the Aghori faces death as a very young child, simultaneously meditating on the totality of life at its two extremes. This ideal example serves as a prototype for other Aghor practices, both left and right, in ritual and in daily life.\"<ref>Barrett, Ron (2008).

The main Aghori pilgrimage centre is Kina Ram's [[hermit]]age or [[ashram]] in Ravindrapuri, [[Varanasi]].<ref>[http://www.varanasi-ganges.com/aghori.html Aghori, Varanasi], Retrieved 2019-11-05.</ref> The full name of this place is [[Baba Keenaram Sthal]], Krim-Kund.  Here, Kina Ram is buried in a tomb or [[samadhi]] which is a centre of pilgrimage for Aghoris and Aghori devotees.  Present head (Abbot), since 1978, of [[Baba Keenaram Sthal]] is [[Baba Siddharth Gautam Ram]].\n\nAccording to Devotees, [http://www.aghoriamitjimaharaj.info/ Baba Siddharth] Gautam Ram is reincarnation of Baba Keenaram himself. Apart from this, any cremation ground would be a holy place for an Aghori ascetic. The cremation grounds near the [[Shakti Pitha|yoni pithas]], 51 holy centres for worship of the Hindu [[Mother Goddess]] scattered across South Asia and the Himalayan terrain, are key locations preferred for performing [[sadhana]] by the Aghoris. They are also known to meditate and perform [[sadhana]] in haunted houses.\n\n==Medicine==\nAghori practice healing through purification as a pillar of their ritual. Their patients believe the Aghoris are able to transfer health to, and pollution away from patients as a form of \"transformative healing\", due to the believed superior state of body and mind of the Aghori.<ref name=\"ProQuest Central\">{{cite book|author=Attewell, Guy|title=Aghor Medicine: Pollution, Death and Healing in Northern India|publisher=University of California Press|year=2008|volume=21|issue=3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/aghormedicinepol0000barr/page/216 216]|doi=10.1093/shm/hkn067|isbn=978-0-520-25219-6|url=https://archive.org/details/aghormedicinepol0000barr/page/216}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aghor Yoga]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n\n*{{cite book|author=Patel, Rajan|title=Feast of Varanasi|publisher=Raafilms|year=2016}}\n*{{cite book|author=Dallapiccola, Anna|title=Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend|publisher=Thames & Hudson|year=2002|isbn=0-500-51088-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofhind0000dall}}\n* {{cite book|author=McDermott, Rachel F.|author2=Kripal, Jeffrey J.|title=Encountering K\u0101l\u012b: in the margins, at the center, in the West|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-520-23239-6}}\n* {{cite book|author=McEvilley, Thomas|title=The Shape of Ancient Thought: comparative studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies|publisher=Allworth Communications, Inc.|year=2002|isbn=978-1-58115-203-6}}\n*{{cite book|author=Parry, Jonathan P.|title=Death in Banaras|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-521-46625-3}}\n*{{cite book|author=Svoboda, Robert|authorlink = Robert Svoboda|title=Aghora: At the Left Hand of God|publisher=Brotherhood of Life|year=1986|isbn=0-914732-21-8}}\n*{{cite book|author=Svoboda, Robert|authorlink=Robert Svoboda|title=Aghora II: Kundalini|publisher=Brotherhood of Life|year=1993|isbn=0-914732-31-5}}\n*Vishwanath Prasad Singh Ashthana, ''Aghor at a glance''\n*Vishwanath Prasad Singh Ashthana, ''Krim-kund Katha''\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{Shaivism}} \n\n[[Category:Shaiva sects]]\n[[Category:Varanasi]]\n[[Category:Left-Hand Path]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4042:2511:f742::f6d:48ac", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aghori"}
