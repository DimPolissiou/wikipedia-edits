The nation achieved independence from Britain on 27 April 1961, and [[Milton Margai]] became the first Prime Minister. Margai's political party was the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP), under the leadership of [[Albert Margai]], and it narrowly lost the 1967 Sierra Leone parliamentary elections to the main opposition party of the [[All People's Congress]] (APC) led by [[Siaka Stevens]]. \n\nStevens was a political strongman who ruled Sierra Leone from 1967 to 1985 when he retired from politics due to poor health. On 19 April 1971, Stevens' government abolished Sierra Leone's parliamentary system and declared Sierra Leone a presidential republic. From 1978 to 1985, president Stevens\" APC party was the only legal political party in Sierra Leone. The multiparty democratic [[constitution of Sierra Leone]] was adopted in 1991 by the government of President [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], Stevens' hand-picked successor, just as the rebel group [[Revolutionary United Front]] led by [[Foday Sankoh]] launched a brutal civil war in the country.\n\nOn 29 April 1992, a group of Junior soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army led by Captain [[Valentine Strasser]] overthrew President Momoh, and Sierra Leone was under Military rule from 1992 to 1996 during the civil war. The country returned to a democratically elected government when the military Junta under Brigadier General [[Julius Maada Bio]] handed the presidency to [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]] of the SLPP after his victory in the 1996 election. However, the Sierra Leone military overthrew President Kabbah in a coup on 25 May 1997, and Major General [[Johnny Paul Koroma]] became the country's head of state. A coalition of West African [[Ecowas]] armed forces led by [[Nigeria]] then reinstated President Kabbah by military force in February 1998, and the leaders of the coup were executed after they were sentenced to death by a Sierra Leone military court. In January 2002, President Kabbah announced the end of the civil war with the help of Ecowas, the British government, the African Union, and the United Nations. Sierra Leone has had an uninterrupted democratic government from 1998 to present.\n\nSixteen ethnic groups inhabit Sierra Leone, each with its own language and customs. The two largest and most influential are the [[Temne people|Temne]] and [[Mende people]]. The Temne are predominantly found in the northwest and the Mende in the southeast. About two percent of the population are the [[Krio people]], who are descendants of freed American and West Indian slaves. English is the official language used in schools and government administration, but [[Krio language|Krio]] is the most widely spoken language, an [[English-based creole]] used by 98 percent of the population. Krio unites all the ethnic groups in the country, especially in their trade and social interaction.\n\nSierra Leone is 77 percent Muslim, with an influential Christian minority of 22 percent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sierra Leone 2015 Population and Housing Census |url=https://www.statistics.sl/images/StatisticsSL/Documents/Census/2015/sl_2015_phc_thematic_report_on_pop_structure_and_pop_distribution.pdf |website=Statistics Sierra Leone}}</ref> The country is regarded as one of the most religiously tolerant countries in the world.

It is also among the largest producers of [[titanium]] and [[bauxite]] and a major producer of gold, and it has one of the world's largest deposits of [[rutile]].

Originally named ''Serra Leoa'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for \"Lioness Mountains\") by Portuguese explorer [[Pedro de Sintra]] in 1462, the modern name is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] spelling, which was introduced by [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Alvise Cadamosto]] and subsequently copied by other European [[cartography|mapmakers]].<ref>https://reignministries.org/5-things-know-sierra-leone/ 5 Thing to Know About Sierra Leone</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Sierra Leone}}\n\n=== Early history ===\n\n[[File:Prehistoric pottery shards, Sierra Leone.jpg|thumb|Fragments of [[prehistoric]] [[pottery]] from [[Kamabai]] Rock Shelter]]\n\n[[File:Bunce Island 1805.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bunce Island]], 1805, during the period the slave factory was run by [[Sir John Anderson, 1st Baronet, of Mill Hill|John]] and [[Alexander Anderson (slave trader)|Alexander Anderson]]]]\n\n[[File:slaves sierra leone.jpg|thumb|An 1835 illustration of liberated Africans arriving in Sierra Leone]]\n\n[[File:Freetown, Sierra Leone ca 1856.jpg|thumb|The colony of Freetown in 1856]]\n\n[[File:Houses at Sierra-Leone (May 1853, X, p.55) - Copy.jpg|thumb|Houses at Sierra-Leone (May 1853, X, p.55)<ref name=\"Juvenile1853\">{{cite journal|title=Houses at Sierra-Leone|journal=The Wesleyan Juvenile Offering: A Miscellany of Missionary Information for Young Persons|date=May 1853|volume=X|page=55|url=https://archive.org/details/wesleyanjuvenil19socigoog|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nArchaeological finds show that Sierra Leone has been inhabited continuously for at least 2,500 years,<ref name=\"Culture of Sierra Leone\">{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Sa-Th/Sierra-Leone.html|title=Culture of Sierra Leone|author=Countries and Their Cultures|accessdate=22 February 2008}}</ref> populated successively by societies who migrated from other parts of Africa.<ref name=\"Sierra Leone History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-55344/Sierra-Leone|title=Sierra Leone History|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> The people adopted the use of iron by the 9th century and by 1000 AD agriculture was being practised along the coast.<ref name=\"Sierra Leone - History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Sierra-Leone-HISTORY.html|title=Sierra Leone \u2013 History|author=Encyclopedia of the Nations|accessdate=22 February 2008}}</ref> The climate changed considerably and boundaries among different ecological zones changed as well, affecting migration and conquest.<ref name=\"brooks\"/>\n\nSierra Leone's dense tropical rainforest and swampy environment was considered impenetrable; it was also host to the [[tsetse fly]], which carried a disease fatal to horses and the [[zebu]] cattle used by the [[Mande people]].

In 1462, [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorer]] [[Pedro de Sintra]] mapped the hills surrounding what is now Freetown Harbour, naming the shaped formation ''Serra da Leoa'' or \"Serra Leoa\" ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for [[Lioness Mountains]]).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Kingfisher Geography encyclopedia''. {{ISBN|1-85613-582-9}}. p. 180</ref> The Spanish rendering of this geographic formation is ''Sierra Leona'', which later was adapted and, misspelled, became the country's current name. Although according to the [[professor]] C. Magbaily Fyle this could have been a misinterpretation of historians: according to him, there has been evidence of travellers calling the region ''Serra Lyoa'' well before 1462, the year when Sintra first arrived. This would imply that the identity of the person who named Sierra Leone is unknown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://slconcordtimes.com/pedro-da-cintra-did-not-name-sierra-leone-an-exploration-into-available-evidence/ |title=Pedro da \u00e7intra did not name Sierra Leone: An Exploration into available evidence |last= |first= |date=22 June 2017 |website= |publisher=Sierra Leone Concord Times |access-date=26 May 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nSoon after Sintra's expedition, Portuguese traders arrived at the harbour.

There were thousands of these [[Black Loyalists]], people of African descent who joined the British military forces during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>Cassandra Pybus, ''Epic Journeys of Freedom: Runaway Slaves of the American Revolution and Their Global Quest for Liberty,'' (Beacon Press, Boston, 2006); Graham Russell Hodges, Susan Hawkes Cook, Alan Edward Brown (eds), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2947159 ''The Black Loyalist Directory: African Americans in Exile After the American Revolution''] {{subscription required|via JSTOR}}</ref> Many of these [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] had been slaves who escaped to join the British, lured by promises of freedom ([[emancipation]]). The official documentation known as the [[Book of Negroes]] lists thousands of freed slaves whom the British evacuated from the nascent United States and resettled in colonies elsewhere in [[British North America]] (north to Canada, or south to the West Indies).\n\nIn 1787 the British Crown founded a settlement in Sierra Leone in what was called the \"[[Province of Freedom]]\". It intended to resettle some of the \"[[Black Poor]] of London\", some of whom were African-Americans freed by the British during the war. About 400 blacks and 60 whites reached Sierra Leone on 15 May 1787. The group also included some [[West Indies|West Indians]] of African descent from London. After they established [[Granville Town]], most of the first group of colonists died, owing to disease and warfare with the indigenous African peoples ([[Temne people|Temne]]), who resisted their encroachment. The 64&nbsp;remaining colonists established a second Granville Town.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Pham |first = John-Peter |title = Child Soldiers, Adult Interests: The Global Dimensions of the Sierra Leonean Tragedy |publisher = Nova Publishers |year = 2005 |pages = 4\u20138 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ZnPFKpwoIkIC&pg=PA4 |isbn = 978-1-59454-671-6 |accessdate = 17 June 2014}}</ref><ref>Michael Sivapragasam, ''Why Did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783\u20131815?''

They founded [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia]], but faced harsh winters and racial discrimination from nearby [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]]. [[Thomas Peters (black leader)|Thomas Peters]] pressed British authorities for relief and more aid; together with British abolitionist [[John Clarkson (abolitionist)|John Clarkson]], the [[Sierra Leone Company]] was established to relocate Black Loyalists who wanted to take their chances in West Africa. In 1792 nearly 1200&nbsp;persons from Nova Scotia crossed the Atlantic to build the second (and only permanent) Colony of Sierra Leone and the settlement of [[Freetown]] on 11 March 1792. In Sierra Leone they were called the [[Nova Scotian Settlers]], the ''Nova Scotians'', or the ''Settlers''.\n\nThe Settlers built Freetown in the styles they knew from their lives in the [[American South]]; they also continued American fashion and American manners. In addition, many continued to practice [[Methodism]] in Freetown. Black settlers in Sierra Leone enjoyed much more autonomy in that they were more politically engaged. Black immigrants elected different levels of political representatives, 'tithingmen', who represented each dozen settlers, and 'hundreders' who represented larger amounts.

These Liberated Africans or ''[[recaptives]]'' were sold for $20 a head as apprentices to the white settlers, Nova Scotian Settlers, and the Jamaican Maroons.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Some of the recaptives who were not sold as apprentices were forced to join the Navy. Many recaptives were treated poorly and even abused because some of the original settlers considered them their property. Cut off from their various homelands and traditions, the Liberated Africans were forced to assimilate to the Western styles of Settlers and Maroons. For example, some of the recaptives were forced to change their name to a more Western sounding one. Though some people happily embraced these changes because they considered it as being part of the community, some were not happy with these changes and wanted to keep their own identity. Many recaptives were so unhappy that they risked the possibility of being sold back into slavery by leaving Sierra Leone and going back to their original villages.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Schwarz|first=Suzanne|date=5 January 2013|title=Reconstructing the Life Histories of Enslaved Africans: Sierra Leone, c. 1808\u201319|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267884583}}</ref> They built a flourishing trade in flowers and beads on the West African coast.\n\nThese returned Africans were from many areas of Africa, but principally the west coast. During the 19th century, freed black Americans, some [[Americo Liberian]] 'refugees', and particularly West Indians, also immigrated and settled in Freetown. Together these peoples created a new creole ethnicity called the [[Krio people]] (initially called Creoles) and a trading language, [[Krio language|Krio]], which became commonly used among many of the ethnicities in the country.\n\n=== Colonial era (1800\u20131961) ===\n\n{{Main|Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate}}\n\nThe settlement of Sierra Leone in the 1800s was unique in that the population was composed of displaced Africans who were brought to the colony after the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807. Upon arrival in Sierra Leone, each \"recaptive\" was given a registration number, and information on their physical qualities would be entered into the Register of Liberated Africans. However, oftentimes the documentation would be overwhelmingly subjective and would result in inaccurate entries, making them difficult to track. In addition, differences between the Register of Liberated Africans of 1808 and the List of Captured Negroes of 1812 (which emulated the 1808 document) revealed some disparities in the entries of the recaptives, specifically in the names; many recaptives decided to change their given names to more [[anglicised]] versions which contributed to the difficulty in tracking them after they arrived in Sierra Leone.\n\nAccording to the British Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807, the recaptives could be subject to apprenticeships led by British colonists in Sierra Leone and the males enlisted into the Army or Navy. In many instances, the recaptives who were assigned to apprenticeships were sold for $20, giving the apprenticeship system qualities similar to slavery.<ref name=\"Schwartz 2012\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Suzanne|date=2012|title=Reconstructing the Life Histories of Liberated Africans: Sierra Leone in the Early Nineteenth Century|url=|journal=History in Africa|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> It is documented that the recaptive apprentices were unpaid and the settlers who they were appointed to had devices which could be used to discipline them, namely sticks. According to Suzanne Schwartz, a historian on colonial Sierra Leone, in June 1808 a group of 21 men and women ran away to the nearby native settlement of Robiss and upon recapture were imprisoned by the settlers in Sierra Leone, thus contributing to the slavery-like qualities of the apprenticeship system.<ref name=\"Schwartz 2012\"/> [[File:Bai Bureh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Bai Bureh]], Temne leader of the [[Hut Tax War of 1898]] against British rule]]\n\nIn the early 19th century, Freetown served as the residence of the British colonial governor of the region, who also administered the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]) and the [[Gambia]] settlements. Sierra Leone developed as the educational centre of British West Africa. The British established [[Fourah Bay College]] here in 1827, which rapidly became a magnet for English-speaking Africans on the West Coast. For more than a century, it was the only European-style university in western [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].\n\n[[File:Bai Bureh (1898).jpg|thumb|Temne leader Bai Bureh seen here in 1898 after his surrender, sitting relaxed in his traditional dress with a handkerchief in his hands, while a Sierra Leonean [[Royal West African Frontier Force|Royal West African Frontier]] soldier stands guard next to him ]]\n\nThe British interacted mostly with the Krios in Freetown, who did most of the trading with the indigenous peoples of the interior. In addition, educated Krios held numerous positions in the colonial government, giving them status and good-paying positions. Following the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885, the UK decided that it needed to establish more dominion over the inland areas, to satisfy what was described by the European powers as \"effective occupation\" of territories. In 1896 it annexed these areas, declaring them the Sierra Leone Protectorate.<ref name=\"harris40\">Harris, David (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=B5RxmwC6aNwC&pg=PA1 ''Civil War and Democracy in West Africa: Conflict Resolution, Elections and Justice in Sierra Leone and Liberia''], I.B.

They designated chiefs as units of local government, rather than dealing with them individually as had been previous practice. They did not maintain relationships even with longtime allies, such as [[Bai Bureh]], chief of Kasseh, a community on the Small Scarcies River. He was later unfairly portrayed as a prime instigator of the Hut Tax war in 1898.<ref name=\"abraham\">{{cite journal\n  |title = Bai Bureh, The British, and the Hut Tax War\n  |last = Abraham\n  |first = Arthur\n  |journal = [[The International Journal of African Historical Studies]]\n  |issn = 0361-7882\n  |volume = 7\n  |issue = 1\n  |year = 1974\n  |pages = 99\u2013106\n  |doi = 10.2307/216556\n  |jstor = 216556\n  }}</ref>\n\nColonel Frederic Cardew, military governor of the Protectorate, in 1898 established a new tax on dwellings and demanded that the chiefs use their peoples to maintain roads. The taxes were often higher than the value of the dwellings, and 24 chiefs signed a petition to Cardew, stating how destructive this was; their people could not afford to take time off from their subsistence agriculture. They resisted payment of taxes. Tensions over the new colonial requirements, and the administration's suspicions about the chiefs led to the [[Hut Tax War of 1898|Hut Tax war of 1898]], also called the Temne-Mende War. The British fired first. The Northern front of majority Temne people was led by [[Bai Bureh]]. The Southern front, consisting mostly of [[Mende people]], entered conflict somewhat later and for different reasons.\n\nFor several months, Bureh's fighters had the advantage over the vastly more powerful British forces, but the British troops and Bureh's warriors suffered hundreds of fatalities.<ref>[http://www.sierra-leone.org/Heroes/heroes5.html History], Sierra-leone.org, Retrieved 17 January 2007.</ref> Bai Bureh finally surrendered on 11 November 1898 to end the destruction of his people's territory and dwellings.

The monopoly was scheduled to last 98 years. Mining of diamonds in the east and other minerals expanded, drawing labourers there from other parts of the country.\n\nIn 1924, the UK government divided Sierra Leone into a Colony and a Protectorate, with different political systems constitutionally defined for each. The Colony was Freetown and its coastal area; the Protectorate was defined as the hinterland areas dominated by local chiefs. Antagonism between the two entities escalated to a heated debate in 1947, when proposals were introduced to provide for a single political system for both the Colony and the Protectorate. Most of the proposals came from leaders of the Protectorate, whose population far outnumbered that in the colony. The Krios, led by [[I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson|Isaac Wallace-Johnson]], opposed the proposals, as they would have resulted in reducing the political power of the Krios in the Colony.\n\nIn 1951, educated protectorate leaders from different groups, including [[Sir]] [[Milton Margai]], [[Lamina Sankoh]], [[Siaka Stevens]], Mohamed Sanusi Mustapha, [[John Karefa-Smart]], Kande Bureh, Sir [[Albert Margai]], [[Amadu Wurie]] and Sir [[Banja Tejan-Sie]] joined together with the powerful [[paramount chiefs]] in the protectorate to form the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] or SLPP as the party of the protectorate.

Margai used his conservative ideology to lead Sierra Leone without much strife. He appointed government officials to represent various ethnic groups.

Sir Albert's leadership was briefly challenged by Foreign Minister [[John Karefa-Smart]], who questioned Sir Albert's succession to the SLPP leadership position. Karefa-Smart led a prominent small minority faction within the SLPP party in opposition of Albert Margai as Prime Minister. However, Kareefa-Smart failed to receive strong support within the SLPP and the SLPP dominated members of parliament in his attempt to have Albert Margai stripped of his position as the leader of the SLPP and prime minister of the country. The large majority of SLPP members backed Albert Margai over Kareefa-Smart. Soon after Albert Margai was sworn in as Prime Minister, he dismissed several senior government officials who had served under his elder brother Milton's government, viewing them as a threat to his administration, including Kareefa-Smart.\n\nSir Albert resorted to increasingly [[authoritarian]] actions in response to protests and enacted several laws against the opposition [[All People's Congress]] (APC), whilst attempting to establish a [[one-party state]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Sir Albert was opposed to the colonial legacy of allowing executive powers to the Paramount Chiefs, many of whom had been key allies of his late brother Sir Milton. Accordingly, they began to consider Sir Albert a threat to the ruling houses across the country. Margai appointed many non-Creoles to the country's [[civil service]] in [[Freetown]], in an overall diversification of the civil service in the capital, which had been dominated by members of the Creole ethnic group. As a result, Albert Margai became unpopular in the Creole community, many of whom had supported Sir Milton. Margai was accused of favoring members of his own Mende ethnic group for prominent positions.\n\nIn 1967, riots broke out in Freetown against Margai's policies; in response he declared a [[state of emergency]] across the country.

Stevens began efforts that would later bridge the distance between the provinces and the city. Roads and hospitals were constructed in the provinces, and Paramount Chiefs and provincial peoples became a prominent force in Freetown.\n\nUnder pressure of several coup attempts, real or perceived, Stevens' rule grew more and more [[authoritarian]], and his relationship with some of his ardent supporters deteriorated. He removed the SLPP party from competitive politics in general elections, some believed, through the use of violence and intimidation. To maintain the support of the military, Stevens retained the popular John Amadu Bangura as the head of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces.\n\nAfter the return to civilian rule, by-elections were held (beginning in autumn 1968) and an all-APC cabinet was appointed. Calm was not completely restored. In November 1968, unrest in the provinces led Stevens to declare a state of emergency across the country. Many senior officers in the Sierra Leone Army were greatly disappointed with Stevens' policies and his handling of the Sierra Leone Military, but none could confront Stevens. Brigadier General Bangura, who had reinstated Stevens as Prime Minister, was widely considered the only person who could control Stevens. The army was devoted to Bangura, and this made him potentially dangerous to Stevens. In January 1970, Bangura was arrested and charged with [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] and plotting to commit a coup against the Stevens government. After a trial that lasted a few months, Bangura was [[convicted]] and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. On 29 March 1970, Brigadier Bangura was executed by hanging in Freetown.\n\nAfter the execution of Bangura, a group of soldiers loyal to the executed Brigadier Bangura held a [[mutiny]] in the capital Freetown and in some other parts of the country in opposition of Stevens' government. Dozens of soldiers were arrested and [[convicted]] by a [[court martial]] in Freetown for their participation in the mutiny against president Stevens. Among the soldiers arrested was a little known army [[Corporal]] [[Foday Sankoh]], a strong supporter of Bangura. Corporal Sankoh was convicted and jailed for seven years at the Pademba Road Prison in Freetown.\n\nIn April 1971, a new republican constitution was adopted under which Stevens became president. In the 1972 by-elections the opposition SLPP complained of intimidation and procedural obstruction by the APC and militia. These problems became so severe that the SLPP boycotted the [[Sierra Leonean general election, 1973|1973 general election]]; as a result the APC won 84 of the 85 elected seats.<ref>{{Cite book |last =Rotberg |first =Robert I. |title =State failure and state weakness in a time of terror |publisher = Brookings Institution Press|year =2003 |page = 80 |url =https://books.google.com/?id=oajfCpTpgCIC&pg=PA80|isbn = 978-0-8157-7574-4|accessdate = 17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAn alleged plot to overthrow president Stevens failed in 1974 and its leaders were executed.

''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/30/ War and state collapse: The case of Sierra Leone]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University</ref> This move led to another major demonstration against the government in many parts of the country, but again it was put down by the army and Stevens' SSD forces.\n\nStevens is generally criticised for dictatorial methods and government corruption, but on a positive note, he kept the country stable and from collapsing into civil war. He built several government institutions that are still in use today.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Stevens also reduced ethnic polarisation in government by incorporating members of various ethnic groups into his all-dominant APC government.\n\nSiaka Stevens retired from politics in November 1985 after being in power for eighteen years. The APC named a new presidential candidate to succeed Stevens at their last delegate conference held in Freetown in November 1985. He was [[Major General]] [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], the head of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces and Stevens' own choice to succeed him. As head of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces, Major General Momoh was very loyal to Stevens, who had appointed him to the position. Like Stevens, Momoh was also a member of the minority [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]] ethnic group.\n\nMomoh was elected president as the only contesting candidate, without any opposition, and was sworn in as Sierra Leone's second president on 28 November 1985 in Freetown. A one-party parliamentary election between APC members was held in May 1986. President Momoh appointed his former military colleague and key ally, Major General Mohamed Tarawalie to succeed him as the head of the Sierra Leone Military. Major General Tarawalie was also a strong loyalist and key supporter of president Momoh. President Momoh named James Bambay Kamara as the head of the [[Sierra Leone Police]]. Bambay Kamara was a key loyalist and strong supporter of President Momoh. Momoh broke away from former president Siaka Stevens, by integrating the powerful SSD into the Sierra Leone Police as a special [[paramilitary force]] of the Sierra Leone Police. Under President Stevens, the SSD had been a powerful personal force used to maintain his hold on power, independent from the Sierra Leone Military and Sierra Leone Police Force. The Sierra Leone Police under Bambay Kamara's leadership, was accused of physical violence, arrest and intimidation against critics of President Momoh's government.\n\nPresident Momoh's strong links with the army and his verbal attacks on corruption earned him much-needed initial support among Sierra Leoneans. With the lack of new faces in the new APC cabinet under president Momoh and the return of many of the old faces from Stevens' government, criticisms soon arose that Momoh was simply perpetuating the rule of Stevens.\n\nThe next couple of years under the Momoh administration were characterised by corruption, which Momoh defused by sacking several senior cabinet ministers. To formalise his war against corruption, President Momoh announced a \"[[Code of Conduct]] for Political Leaders and Public Servants.\" After an alleged attempt to overthrow President Momoh in March 1987, more than 60 senior government officials were arrested, including Vice President [[Francis Minah]], who was removed from office, convicted of plotting the coup, and executed by [[hanging]] in 1989 along with 5 others.\n\n=== Sierra Leone Civil War (1991\u20132002) ===\n\n{{Further|Sierra Leone Civil War}}\n\n[[File:School destroyed by Sierra Leone Civil War.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A school in [[Koindu]] destroyed during the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Civil War]]; in total 1,270 primary schools were destroyed in the War.<ref name=\"ilab\"/>]]\n\nIn October 1990, owing to mounting pressure from both within and outside the country for political and economic reform, president Momoh set up a constitutional review commission to assess the 1978 one-party constitution. Based on the commission's recommendations a constitution re-establishing a multi-party system was approved by the exclusive APC Parliament by a 60% majority vote, becoming effective on 1 October 1991. There was great suspicion that president Momoh was not serious about his promise of political reform, as APC rule continued to be increasingly marked by abuses of power.\n\nThe brutal civil war that was going on in neighbouring [[Liberia]] played a significant role in the outbreak of fighting in Sierra Leone. [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] \u2013 then leader of the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] \u2013 reportedly helped form the [[Revolutionary United Front|Revolutionary United Front (RUF)]] under the command of former Sierra Leonean army [[corporal]] [[Foday Sankoh|Foday Saybana Sankoh]], an ethnic Temne from [[Tonkolili District]] in Northern Sierra Leone. Sankoh was a British trained former army corporal who had also undergone guerrilla training in Libya. Taylor's aim was for the RUF to attack the bases of Nigerian dominated peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone who were opposed to his rebel movement in Liberia.\n\nOn 29 April 1992, a group of young soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army, led by seven army officers \u2014 Lieutenant Sahr Sandy, Captain [[Valentine Strasser]], Sergeant [[Solomon Musa]], Captain [[Komba Mondeh]], Lieutenant [[Tom Nyuma]], Captain [[Julius Maada Bio]] and Captain Komba Kambo\u2014<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sl/drwebsite/exec/view.cgi?archive=2&num=106 |title=NPRC's Komba Kambo Speaks After Eleven Years Of Silence!: Sierra Leone News |publisher=News.sl |accessdate=17 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222185702/http://news.sl/drwebsite/exec/view.cgi?archive=2&num=106 |archivedate=22 February 2014}}</ref> launched a [[military coup]] that sent president Momoh into [[exile]] in Guinea, and the young soldiers established the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC), with 25-year-old Captain Valentine Strasser as its chairman and Head of State of the country.<ref name=\"blogspot1\">{{cite web|url=http://salonenow.blogspot.com/2011/08/attempts-to-launder-maada-bios-battered.html#!/2011/08/attempts-to-launder-maada-bios-battered.html |title=SIERRA LEONE NOW: Attempts To Launder Maada Bio's Battered Image Fail...

Strasser became the world's youngest Head of State when he seized power just three days after his 25th birthday. The NPRC junta established the National Supreme Council of State as the military highest command and final authority in all matters, and was exclusively made up of the highest ranking NPRC soldiers, included Strasser himself and the original soldiers who toppled president Momoh.<ref name=\"blogspot1\"/>\n\nOne of the highest ranking soldiers of the NPRC Junta, Lieutenant Sahr Sandy, a trusted ally of Strasser, was assassinated, allegedly by Major S.I.M. Turay, a key loyalist of ousted president Momoh. A heavily armed military manhunt took place across the country to find Lieutenant Sandy's killer. However, the main suspect, Major S.I.M Turay, went into hiding and fled the country to Guinea, fearing for his life. Dozens of soldiers loyal to the ousted president Momoh were arrested, including Colonel Kahota M. Dumbuya and Major Yayah Turay. Lieutenant Sandy was given a [[state funeral]] and his funeral prayers service at the [[cathedral]] church in Freetown was attended by many high-ranking soldiers of the NPRC junta, including Strasser himself and NPRC deputy leader Sergeant Solomon Musa.\n\nThe NPRC Junta immediately suspended the constitution, banned all political parties, limited [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]] and enacted a rule-by-decree policy, in which soldiers were granted unlimited powers of administrative detention without charge or trial, and challenges against such detentions in court were precluded.\n\nThe NPRC Junta maintained relations with the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and strengthened support for Sierra Leone-based [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|ECOMOG]] troops fighting in Liberia. On 28 December 1992, an alleged coup attempt against the NPRC government of Strasser, aimed at freeing the detained Colonel Yahya Kanu, Colonel Kahota M.S. Dumbuya and former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara, was foiled. Several Junior army officers led by Sergeant Mohamed Lamin Bangura were identified as being behind the coup plot. The coup plot led to the [[firing squad]] execution of seventeen soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army including Colonel Kahota M Dumbuya, Major Yayah Kanu and Sergeant Mohamed Lamin Bangura. Several prominent members of the Momoh government who had been in detention at the Pa Demba Road prison, including former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara, were also executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standardtimespress.org/artman/publish/article_4699.shtml |title=Standard Times Press Sierra Leone's NPRC's Ruthlessness No Death Certificates For 29 Sierra Leoneans |publisher=Standardtimespress.org |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 July 1994 the deputy NPRC leader Sergeant Solomon Musa, who was very popular with the general population, particularly in Freetown, was arrested and sent into exile after he was accused of planning a coup to topple Strasser, an accusation Sergeant Musa denied. Strasser replaced Musa as deputy NPRC chairman with Captain Julius Maada Bio, who was instantly promoted by Strasser to [[Brigadier]].\n\nThe NPRC proved to be nearly as ineffectual as the Momoh-led APC government in repelling the RUF. More and more of the country fell to RUF fighters, and by 1994 they held much of the diamond-rich Eastern Province and were at the edge of Freetown. In response, the NPRC hired several hundred mercenaries from the private firm [[Executive Outcomes]]. Within a month they had driven RUF fighters back to enclaves along Sierra Leone's borders, and cleared the RUF from the Kono diamond-producing areas of Sierra Leone.\n\nWith Strasser's two most senior NPRC allies and commanders Lieutenant Sahr Sandy and Lieutenant [[Solomon Musa]] no longer around to defend him, Strasser's leadership within the NPRC Supreme Council of State was not considered much stronger. On 16 January 1996, after about four years in power, Strasser was arrested in a palace coup at the Defence Headquarters in Freetown by his fellow NPRC soldiers.<ref name=\"FSL Vol 2 No 1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk/Vol2_1.htm |title=FSL Vol 2 No 1 |publisher=Focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk |accessdate=23 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928012312/http://www.focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk/Vol2_1.htm |archive-date=28 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Strasser was immediately flown into exile in a [[military helicopter]] to [[Conakry]], [[Guinea]].\n\nIn his first public broadcast to the nation following the 1996 coup, Brigadier Bio stated that his support for returning Sierra Leone to a democratically elected civilian government and his commitment to ending the civil war were his motivations for the coup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/How+Sierra+Leone+fell+into+the+hands+of+young+soldiers.-a0254314002 |title=How Sierra Leone fell into the hands of young soldiers|publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> Promises of a return to civilian rule were fulfilled by Bio, who handed power over to [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]], of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), after the conclusion of elections in early 1996. President Kabbah took power with a great promise of ending the civil war. President Kabbah opened [[dialogue]] with the RUF and invited RUF leader Foday Sankoh for peace negotiations.\n\nOn 25 May 1997, seventeen soldiers in the Sierra Leone army led by Corporal Tamba Gborie, loyal to the detained [[Major General]] [[Johnny Paul Koroma]], launched a military coup which sent President Kabbah into exile in Guinea and they established the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]] (AFRC). Corporal Gborie quickly went to the SLBS FM 99.9 headquarters in Freetown to announce the coup to a shocked nation and to alert all soldiers across the country to report for guard duty. The soldiers immediately released Koroma from prison and installed him as their chairman and Head of State.\n\nKoroma suspended the constitution, banned demonstrations, shut down all private radio stations in the country and invited the RUF to join the new junta government, with its leader Foday Sankoh as the Vice-Chairman of the new AFRC-RUF coalition junta government. Within days, Freetown was overwhelmed by the presence of the RUF combatants who came to the city in thousands. The Kamajors, a group of traditional fighters mostly from the Mende ethnic group under the command of deputy [[Defence Minister]] [[Samuel Hinga Norman]], remained loyal to President Kabbah and defended the Southern part of Sierra Leone from the soldiers.\n\n=== Kabbah's government and the end of civil war (2002\u20132014) ===\n\n{{update|section|date=February 2013}}\n\nAfter nine months in office, the junta was overthrown by the Nigerian-led [[ECOMOG]] forces, and the democratically elected government of president Kabbah was reinstated in February 1998. On 19 October 1998 24 soldiers in the Sierra Leone army were executed by firing squad after they were convicted in a [[court martial]] in Freetown, some for orchestrating the 1997 coup that overthrew President Kabbah and others for failure to reverse the mutiny.<ref>[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr51/019/1998/en/ Document \u2013 Sierra Leone: Imminent execution / death penalty / legal concern |Amnesty International] .

The first of the 6,000-member force began arriving in December, and the [[UN Security Council]] voted in February 2000 to increase the force to 11,000, and later to 13,000. But in May, when nearly all [[Nigeria]]n forces had left and UN forces were trying to disarm the RUF in eastern Sierra Leone, [[Foday Sankoh|Sankoh]]'s forces clashed with the UN troops, and some 500 peacekeepers were taken [[hostage]] as the peace accord effectively collapsed. The hostage crisis resulted in more fighting between the RUF and the government as UN troops launched [[Operation Khukri]] to end the siege. The Operation was successful with Indian and British [[Special Forces]] being the main contingents.\n\nThe situation in the country deteriorated to such an extent that British troops were deployed in [[Operation Palliser]], originally simply to evacuate foreign nationals. However, the British exceeded their original mandate, and took full military action to finally defeat the rebels and restore order. The British were the catalyst for the ceasefire that ended the civil war. Elements of the [[British Army]], together with administrators and politicians, remain in Sierra Leone to this day,{{when|date=October 2019}} helping train the armed forces, improve the infrastructure of the country and administer financial and material aid. [[Tony Blair]], the Prime Minister of Britain at the time of the British intervention, is regarded as a hero by the people of Sierra Leone, many of whom are keen for more British involvement.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Sierra Leoneans have been described{{by whom|date=October 2019}} as \"The World's Most Resilient People\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bah|first=M.|title=The Worlds Most Resilient People|year=1998|publisher=Alpha|location=London}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1991 and 2001, about [[List of wars by death toll|50,000 people were killed]] in Sierra Leone's civil war. Hundreds of thousands of people were forced from their homes and many became refugees in [[Guinea]] and [[Liberia]]. In 2001, UN forces moved into rebel-held areas and began to disarm rebel soldiers. By January 2002, the war was declared over. In May 2002, [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah|Kabbah]] was re-elected president by a landslide. By 2004, the disarmament process was complete. Also in 2004, a UN-backed [[war crime]]s court began holding trials of senior leaders from both sides of the war. In December 2005, UN peacekeeping forces pulled out of Sierra Leone.\n\nIn August 2007, Sierra Leone held presidential and parliamentary elections. However, no presidential candidate won the 50% plus one vote majority stipulated in the constitution on the first round of voting.

The country is among the top ten diamond producing nations. Mineral exports remain the main [[currency]] earner. Sierra Leone is a major producer of gem-quality diamonds. Though rich in diamonds, it has historically struggled to manage their exploitation and export.\n\nSierra Leone is known for its [[blood diamond]]s that were mined and sold to diamond conglomerates during the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]], to buy the weapons that fuelled its atrocities.<ref>{{cite news|title=UN targets 'blood diamonds' trade|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3117421.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=28 April 2011|date=1 August 2003}}</ref> In the 1970s and early 1980s, economic growth rate slowed because of a decline in the mining sector and increasing corruption among government officials.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable infobox\" style=\"margin-right: 0; margin-left: 1em; text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size: 115%;\" |Percentage of GDP by sector (2007)<ref name=\"AFEC\"/>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Rank\n! scope=\"col\" |Sector\n! scope=\"col\" |Percentage<br/> of GDP\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1\n|Agriculture\n|58.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2\n|Other services\n|10.4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |3\n|Trade and tourism\n|9.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |4\n|Wholesale and retail trade\n|9.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |5\n|Mining and quarrying\n|4.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |6\n|Government Services\n|4.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |7\n|Manufacturing and handicrafts\n|2.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |8\n|Construction\n|1.7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |9\n|Electricity and water\n|0.4\n|}\n\nAnnual production of Sierra Leone's diamond estimates range between US$250 million\u2013$300&nbsp;million. Some of that is [[Smuggling|smuggled]], where it is possibly used for [[money laundering]] or financing illicit activities. Formal exports have dramatically improved since the civil war, with efforts to improve the management of them having some success. In October 2000, a UN-approved certification system for exporting diamonds from the country was put in place and led to a dramatic increase in legal exports. In 2001, the government created a mining community development fund ([[Ministry of Mineral Resources (Sierra Leone)|DACDF]]), which returns a portion of diamond export taxes to diamond mining communities. The fund was created to raise local communities' stake in the legal diamond trade.\n\nSierra Leone has one of the world's largest deposits of [[rutile]], a [[titanium]] ore used as [[paint]] pigment and [[welding]] rod coatings.\n\n=== Transport infrastructure ===\n\n{{Main|Transport in Sierra Leone}}\n\n[[File:Kenema-Kailahun Road.jpg|thumb|The road from [[Kenema]] to [[Kailahun District]]]]\n\nThere are a number of systems of transport in Sierra Leone, which has a road, air and water infrastructure, including a network of highways and several airports. There are {{convert|11,300|km|abbr=off}} of highways in Sierra Leone, of which {{convert|904|km|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"CIA\"/> are paved (about 8% of the roads). Sierra Leone's highways are linked to [[Conakry]], Guinea, and [[Monrovia]], Liberia.\n\nSierra Leone has the largest [[natural harbour]] on the African continent, allowing international shipping through the [[Queen Elizabeth II Quay]] in the [[Cline Town, Sierra Leone|Cline Town]] area of eastern Freetown or through Government Wharf in central Freetown. There are {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} of waterways in Sierra Leone, of which {{convert|600|km|0|abbr=on}} are navigable year-round. Major port cities are [[Bonthe]], [[Freetown]], [[Sherbro Island]] and [[Pepel]].\n\nThere are ten [[regional airport]]s in Sierra Leone, and one [[international airport]]. The [[Lungi International Airport]] located in the coastal town of [[Lungi, Sierra Leone|Lungi]] in Northern Sierra Leone is the primary airport for domestic and international travel to or from Sierra Leone. Passengers cross the river to Aberdeen [[Heliport]]s in Freetown by [[hovercraft]], ferry or a [[helicopter]]. Helicopters are also available from the airport to other major cities in the country. The airport has [[Pavement (material)|paved]] runways longer than {{convert|3,047|m|abbr=off}}. The other airports have unpaved runways, and seven have runways from {{convert|914|to|1,523|m|abbr=off}} long; the remaining two have shorter runways.\n\nSierra Leone appears on the EU list of prohibited countries with regard to the certification of airlines. This means that no airline registered in Sierra Leone may operate services of any kind within the European Union.

Recently there has been an increase of [[Pentecostal]] churches, especially in Freetown.\n\nIn September 2017, a Sierra Leone-based Nigerian [[Pentecostal]] Christian pastor name Victor Ajisafe was arrested by the [[Sierra Leone Police]] and held in [[jail]] after he preached an extreme [[religious intolerance]] and a [[fanatical]] [[hate speech]] against [[Islam]] and Sierra Leonean Muslims in particular at his church [[sermon]] in the capital [[Freetown]]. Ajisafe was apparently angry and [[jealous]] after a [[Zimbabwean]] internationally renowned Muslim [[cleric]] [[Mufti Menk]] visited Sierra Leone and had approximately over one hundred thousand people in and outside the national stadium in Freetown to listen to his Islamic sermon in his visit to Sierra Leone on 21 to 23 September 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ayvnews.com/AYVNews/index.php/news/item/4084-mufti-menk-s-visit-to-sierra-loenep |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401173250/http://ayvnews.com/AYVNews/index.php/news/item/4084-mufti-menk-s-visit-to-sierra-loenep |archive-date=1 April 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many Christian organizations in Sierra Leone, including the Council of Churches condemned Ajisafe's sermon against Islam and Muslims. Ajisafe\"s church was temporarily shut down by the Sierra Leone government and his church license was temporarily suspended too. The incident brought religious tension in Sierra Leone, in a country known for its very high level of religious tolerance, as many Sierra Leonean Muslims at home and abroad were extremely angry, many called for Ajisafe to be [[deported]] back to his home country of [[Nigeria]]. The pastor while in Sierra Leone [[police custody]] apologized to Sierra Leonean Muslims and to the government of Sierra Leone. After several days in jail, Ajisafe was released, his church license was given back to him, and his church was later reopened under strict government condition during several months of [[probation]].\n\n[[Nondenominational Christianity|Non-denominational Protestants]] form a significant minority of Sierra Leone's Christian population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=11887 |title=Sierra Leone: in wake of brutal war, churches full: News Headlines |publisher=Catholic Culture |date=28 September 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref> [[Catholics]] are the largest group of non-Protestant Christians in Sierra Leone, forming about 8% of Sierra Leone's population and 26% of the Christian population in Sierra Leone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicchurchsl.org/ |title=catholicchurchsl.org |publisher=catholicchurchsl.org |accessdate=20 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504130803/http://www.catholicchurchsl.org/ |archive-date=4 May 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/offices/sierra-leone/ |title=Visitors & Tours: Jehovahs Witnesses Office in Sierra Leone |publisher=Jw.org |accessdate=23 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005142744/http://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/offices/sierra-leone/ |archive-date=5 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics/country/sierra-leone |title=Sierra Leone \u2013 LDS Statistics and Church Facts &#124; Total Church Membership |publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org |date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Gerry Avant |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765616902/Historic-milestone-Sierra-Leone-stake-marks-LDS-Churchs-3000th.html?pg=all |title=Historic milestone: Sierra Leone stake marks LDS Church's 3,000th |newspaper=Deseret News |date=2 December 2012 |accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref> are the two most prominent [[Nontrinitarianism|non Trinitarian]] Christians in Sierra Leone, and they form a small but significant minority of the Christian population in Sierra Leone.

The largest and most influential are the [[Mende people|Mende]] at about 32.2% and the [[Temne people|Temne]] at about 31.6%. The Temne predominate in the [[Northern Province, Sierra Leone|Northern Sierra Leone]] and the [[Western Area, Sierra Leone|some areas around the capital of Sierra Leone]]. The Mende predominate in [[Southern Province, Sierra Leone|South]]-Eastern Sierra Leone (with the exception of [[Kono District]]).\n\nThe vast majority of Temne are Muslims at over 85%; and with a significant Christian minority at about 10%. The Mende are also Muslim majority at about 70%, though with a large Christian minority at about 30%. Sierra Leone's national politics centres on the competition between the north-west, dominated by the Temne, and the south-east dominated by the Mende. The vast majority of the Mende support the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP); while the majority of the Temne support the [[All People's Congress]] (APC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewpeople.com/national-news/politics/item/1764-sierra-leone-the-temnes-and-the-politics-of-the-all-peoples%E2%80%99-congress-apc |title=Sierra Leone: The Temnes and the Politics of the All Peoples' Congress (APC) |publisher=Thenewpeople.com |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Mende, who are believed to be descendants of the [[Mane people|Mane]], originally occupied the Liberian hinterland. They began moving into Sierra Leone slowly and peacefully in the eighteenth century. The Temne are said to migrated from [[Futa Jallon]], which is in present-day [[Guinea]].\n\nThe third-largest ethnic group are the [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]] at about 8.4% of the population. The Limba are [[indigenous peoples|native]] people of Sierra Leone. They have no tradition of origin, and it is believed that they have lived in Sierra Leone since before the European encounter. The Limba are primarily found in Northern Sierra Leone, particularly in [[Bombali District|Bombali]], [[Kambia District|Kambia]] and [[Koinadugu District]]. The Limba are about 60% Christian and 40% Muslims. The Limba are close political allies of the neighbouring Temne.\n\nSince Independence, the Limba have traditionally been very influential in Sierra Leone's politics, along with the Mende. The vast majority of Limba support the All People's Congress (APC) political party. Sierra Leone's first and second presidents, [[Siaka Stevens]] and [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], respectively, were both ethnic Limba. Sierra Leone's current [[Defense Minister]] [[Paolo Conteh|Alfred Paolo Conteh]] is an ethnic Limba.\n \nOne of the biggest minority ethnic groups are the [[Fula people|Fula]] at around 3.8% of the population. Descendants of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Fula migrant settlers from the [[Fouta Djalon]] region of Guinea, they live primarily in the northeast and the western area of Sierra Leone. The Fula are virtually all Muslims at over 99%. The Fula are primarily [[merchant|traders]], and many live in middle-class homes. Because of their trading, the Fulas are found in nearly all parts of the country.\n\nThe other ethnic groups are the [[Mandingo people of Sierra Leone|Mandingo]] (also known as [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]]). They are descendants of [[Merchant|traders]] from Guinea who migrated to Sierra Leone during the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. The Mandika are predominantly found in the east and the northern part of the country. They predominate in the large towns, most notably [[Karina, Sierra Leone|Karina]], in Bombali District in the north; [[Kabala, Sierra Leone|Kabala]] and [[Falaba]] in Koinadugu District in the north; and [[Yengema]], [[Kono District]] in the east of the country. Like the Fula, the Mandinka are virtually all Muslims at over 99\u2105. Sierra Leone's third president [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]], and Sierra Leone's first Vice-President [[Sorie Ibrahim Koroma]] were both ethnic Mandingo.\n\nNext in proportion are the [[Kono people|Kono]], who live primarily in [[Kono District]] in Eastern Sierra Leone. The Kono are descendants of migrants from Guinea; today their workers are known primarily as diamond miners. The majority of the Kono ethnic group are Christians, though with an influential Muslim minority. Sierra Leone's former Vice-President [[Samuel Sam-Sumana|Alhaji Samuel Sam-Sumana]] is an ethnic Kono.\n\nThe small but significant [[Krio people]] (descendants of freed African American, [[West Indian]] and Liberated African slaves who settled in Freetown between 1787 and about 1885) make up about 3% of the population. They primarily occupy the capital city of [[Freetown]] and its surrounding [[Western Area]]. Krio culture reflects the Western culture and ideals within which many of their ancestors originated \u2013 they also had close ties with British officials and colonial administration during years of development.\n\nThe Krio have traditionally dominated Sierra Leone's judiciary and Freetown's elected city council. One of the first ethnic groups to become educated according to Western traditions, they have traditionally been appointed to positions in the civil service, beginning during the colonial years. They continue to be influential in the civil service. The vast majority of Krios are Christians at about 90%, though with a small but significant Muslim minority at 10% known locally as Oku.\n\nOther minority ethnic groups are the [[Kuranko people|Kuranko]], who are related to the Mandingo, and are largely Muslims. The Kuranko are believed to have begun arriving in Sierra Leone from Guinea in about 1600 and settled in the north, particularly in [[Koinadugu District]]. The Kuranko are primarily farmers; leaders among them have traditionally held several senior positions in the Military. The current Governor of the [[Bank of Sierra Leone]] [[Kaifala Marah]] is an ethnic Kuranko. The Kuranko are largely Muslim majority.\n\nThe [[Loko people|Loko]] in the north are native people of Sierra Leone, believed to have lived in Sierra Leone since the time of European encounter. Like the neighbouring Temne, the Loko are Muslim majority. The [[Susu people|Susu]] and their related [[Yalunka people|Yalunka]] The Susu and their related Yalunka are traders; both groups are primarily found in the far north in Kambia and Koinadugu District close to the border with Guinea. The Susu and Yalunka kingdom was established in the early 5th 7th century before Mali empire, which was extended from Mali, Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Guinea Conakry to the northern part of Sierra Leone. They are the original owners of the Futa Djallon region covered by a vars land area both the Susu and Yalunka people are descendants of the Mande people. They are virtually all Muslims. The Yalunka, also spelled Jallonke, Yalonga, Djallonk\u00e9, Djallonka or Dialonk\u00e9, are a Mande people who have lived in the Djallon, a mountainous region in Sierra Leone, Mali, Senegal, Guinea Bissau and Guinea Conakry West Africa over 520 years ago. The name Yalunka literally means \"inhabitants of the Jallon (mountains).\" Manga Sewa was born in Falaba, Solima chiefdom, in the Northern Province of British Sierra Leone to Yalunka parents. His father was a Yalunka paramount chief of Solima, a prosperous chieftaincy. Its capital, Falaba, was on the rich trading routes leading to the coast. Manga Sewa's father had a number of wives and dozens of children.are traders; both groups are primarily found in the far north in [[Kambia District|Kambia]] and Koinadugu District close to the border with Guinea. The Susu and Yalunka are both descendants of migrants from Guinea; and they both are virtually all Muslims at over 99%.\n\nThe [[Kissi people|Kissi]] live further inland in South-Eastern Sierra Leone. They predominate in the large town of [[Koindu]] and its surrounding areas in Kailahun District. The vast majority of Kissi are Christians. The much smaller [[Vai people|Vai]] and [[Kru people|Kru]] peoples are primarily found in [[Kailahun District|Kailahun]] and Pujehun Districts near the border with Liberia. The Kru predominate in the Kroubay neighbourhood in the capital Freetown. The Vai are largely Muslim majority at about 90%, while the Kru are virtually all Christians at over 99%.\n\nOn the coast in [[Bonthe District]] in the south are the [[Sherbro people|Sherbro]]. Native to Sierra Leone, they have occupied [[Sherbro Island]] since it was founded. The Sherbro are primarily [[fisherman]] and [[farmers]], and they are predominantly found in Bonthe District. The Sherbro are virtually all Christians, and their paramount chiefs had a history of intermarriage with British colonists and traders.\n\nA small number of Sierra Leoneans are of partial or full [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] ancestry, descendants of traders who first came to the nation in the 19th century. They are locally known as Sierra Leonean-Lebanese. The Sierra Leonean-Lebanese community are primarily traders and they mostly live in middle-class households in the urban areas, primarily in [[Freetown]], [[Bo, Sierra Leone|Bo]], [[Kenema]], [[Koidu|Koidu Town]] and [[Makeni]].\n\n== Gender equality ==\n\n=== Household ===\n\nAlthough women account for about 50 percent of the population in Sierra Leone, only 28 percent are household heads.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.statistics.sl/images/StatisticsSL/Documents/Census/2015/sl_2015_phc_thematic_report_on_gender.pdf|title=Sierra Leone 2015 Population and Housing Census Thematic Report on Gender |last=Fatou Taqi |author2=Marian Vinnie-Wilson |author3=Alimatu Vandi |first=Fatou, Marian, Alimatu|date=2015|website=|access-date=}}</ref> As in the rest of the countries, education is a key factor in succeeding in aspects such as a well-paid job and covering the needs of a house.

Stations mainly consist of local commercial stations with a limited broadcast range, combined with a few stations with national coverage \u2013 [[Capital Radio Sierra Leone]] being the largest of the commercial stations.\n\nThe United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) ran one of the most popular stations in the country, broadcasting programs in a range of languages. The UN mission were restructured in 2008 and it was decided that the UN Radio would be merged with SLBS to form the new Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC). This merger eventually happened in 2011 after the necessary legislation was enacted. SLBC transmits radio on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and has two television services, one of which is uplinked by satellite for international consumption. FM relays of [[BBC World Service]] (in Freetown, Bo, Kenema and Makeni), [[Radio France Internationale]] (Freetown only) and [[Voice of America]] (Freetown only) are also broadcast.\n\nOutside the capital Freetown and other major cities, television is not watched by a great many people, although Bo, Kenema and Makeni are served by their own relays of the main SLBC service. There are three free terrestrial television stations in Sierra Leone, one run by the government SLBC and the other two are private stations in Freetown, Star TV which is run by the owner of the ''Standard Times'' newspaper and AYV - Africa Young Voices. There are a number of religious funded TV stations that operate intermittently. Two other commercial TV operators (ABC and AIT) closed after they were not profitable. In 2007, a pay-per-view service was also introduced by GTV as part of a pan-African television service in addition to the nine-year-old sub-Saharan Digital satellite television service (DStv) originating from Multichoice Africa in South Africa. GTV subsequently went out of business, leaving DStv as the only provider of subscription satellite television in the country. A number of organisations planned to operate digital terrestrial subscription TV services, with Multichoice's Go TV having built infrastructure ahead of getting a licence and ultimately failing to get a license. ITV and SATCON are currently operational.\n\nInternet access in Sierra Leone has been sparse but is on the increase, especially since the introduction of 3G/4G cellular phone services across the country. There are several main [[internet service providers]] (ISPs) operating in the country. Freetown has [[internet caf\u00e9s]] and other businesses offering internet access. Problems experienced with access to the Internet include an intermittent electricity supply and a slow connection speed in the country outside Freetown.\n\n=== Arts ===\n\n{{Further|Art in Sierra Leone|Music of Sierra Leone}}\n\nThe arts in Sierra Leone are a mixture of tradition and hybrid African and western styles.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Banham|first = Martin |title = A history of theatre in Africa|publisher =Cambridge University Press |year =2004|page = 171|url =https://books.google.com/?id=RZXtk9bCZ-8C&pg=PA171|isbn=978-0-521-80813-2|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last =Conteh |first = Prince Sorie |title = Traditionalists, Muslims, and Christians in Africa: interreligious encounters and dialogue|publisher =Cambria Press |year =2009|pages = 23\u201324|url =https://books.google.com/?id=HpAuyiMRTDcC&pg=PA23|isbn=978-1-60497-596-3|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last =Manson |first =Katrina |first2=James |last2=Knight |title = Sierra Leone|publisher = Bradt Travel Guides|year =2009|pages = 42\u201345|url =https://books.google.com/?id=VxRcEzkFs-wC&pg=PA43|isbn=978-1-84162-222-4|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Temne.

Children, youth and adult are frequently seen playing [[street football]] across Sierra Leone. There are organised youth and adult football tournaments across the country, and there are various primary and secondary schools with football teams across Sierra Leone.\n\nThe Sierra Leone national football team, popularly known as the [[Leone Stars]], represents the country in international competitions. It has never qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] but participated in the [[1994 African Cup of Nations|1994]] and [[1996 African Cup of Nations]]. When the national football team, the Leone Stars, have a match, Sierra Leoneans across the country come together united in support of the national team and people rush to their local radio and television stations to follow the live match. The country's national television network, The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) broadcasts the national football team live match, along with many local radio stations across the country.\n\nWhen the Leone Stars win an important match, many youth across the county rush to the street to celebrate. Many of the Sierra Leone national team footballers play for teams based in Europe although virtually all of them started professional football in the [[Sierra Leone National Premier League]]. Many of the national team footballers are celebrities across Sierra Leone and they are often well known by the general population. Some of Sierra Leonean international footballers include [[Mohamed Kallon]], [[Mohamed Bangura (footballer)|Mohamed Bangura]], [[Rodney Strasser]], [[Kei Kamara]], [[Ibrahim Teteh Bangura]], [[Mustapha Dumbuya]], [[Christian Caulker]], [[Al Bangura|Alhassan Bangura]], [[Sheriff Suma]], [[Mohamed Kamara]], [[Umaru Bangura]] and [[Julius Wobay|Julius Gibrilla Woobay]].\n\nThe [[Sierra Leone National Premier League]] is the top professional football league in Sierra Leone and is controlled by the [[Sierra Leone Football Association]]. Fourteen clubs from across the country compete in the Sierra Leone Premier League. The two biggest and most successful football clubs are [[East End Lions]] and [[Mighty Blackpool]]. East End Lions and Mighty Blackpool have an intense rivalry and when they play each other the national stadium in Freetown is often sold out and supporters of both clubs often clash with each other before and after the game. There is a huge police presence inside and outside the national stadium during a match between the two great rivals to prevent a clash. Many Sierra Leonean youth follow the local football league.\n\nMany Sierra Leonean youth, children and adults follow the major football leagues in Europe, particularly the English [[Premier League]], Italian [[Serie A]], Spanish [[La Liga]], German [[Bundesliga]] and French [[Ligue 1]].\n\nThe [[Sierra Leone cricket team]] represents Sierra Leone in international cricket competitions, and is among the best in West Africa. It became an affiliate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] in 2002. It made its international debut at the 2004 African Affiliates Championship, where it finished last of eight teams. But at the equivalent tournament in 2006, Division Three of the African region of the World Cricket League, it finished as runner-up to [[Mozambique]], and just missed a promotion to Division Two.\n\nIn 2009, the Sierra Leone Under-19 team finished second in the African Under-19 Championship in Zambia, thus qualifying for the Under-19 World Cup qualifying tournament with nine other teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/other/content/story/403002.html |title=Cricinfo article Uganda and Sierra Leone Win Through |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> However, the team was unable to obtain Canadian visas to play in the tournament, which was held in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/other/content/story/423890.html |title=Visa Issues End Sierra Leone's World Cup Dream |publisher=Cricinfo article |date=7 September 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nBasketball is not a very popular sport in Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leone national basketball team represents Sierra Leone in international men's basketball competitions and is controlled by the Sierra Leone Basketball Federation.\n\nThe [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is popular among a small portion of the youth population. NBA superstars [[LeBron James]], [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Kevin Durant]] are popular among Sierra Leone's youthful population. Former NBA stars, in particular [[Michael Jordan]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Allen Iverson]] and [[Magic Johnson]] are popular in the country. Michael Jordan in particular is the most famous basketball player in the country and he is very popular among the general population. Current NBA youngstar [[Victor Oladipo]] is of Sierra Leonean descent, as his father is a native of Sierra Leone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-26/sports/38042288_1_dematha-gym-dunk-contest/2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519112746/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-26/sports/38042288_1_dematha-gym-dunk-contest/2 |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 May 2013 |title=Washington Post: Breaking News, World, US, DC News & Analysis |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=12 September 2013 |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough tennis is not very popular in the country, up-and-coming American player [[Frances Tiafoe]] is the son of two Sierra Leoneans who emigrated to the United States.\n\nSierra Leone is the first African country to join the [[International Floorball Federation]].\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Sierra Leone|Africa}}\n\n*[[Index of Sierra Leone-related articles]]\n\n*[[Outline of Sierra Leone]]\n\n*[[2014 Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra Leone]]\n\n*{{Books-inline|Sierra Leone}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n===Further reading===\n\n*Acemoglu, Daron, Tristan Reed, and James A.

The nation achieved independence from Britain on 27 April 1961, and [[Milton Margai]] became the first Prime Minister. Margai's political party was the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP), under the leadership of [[Albert Margai]], and it narrowly lost the 1967 Sierra Leone parliamentary elections to the main opposition party of the [[All People's Congress]] (APC) led by [[Siaka Stevens]]. \n\nStevens was a political strongman who ruled Sierra Leone from 1967 to 1985 when he retired from politics due to poor health. On 19 April 1971, Stevens' government abolished Sierra Leone's parliamentary system and declared Sierra Leone a presidential republic. From 1978 to 1985, president Stevens\" APC party was the only legal political party in Sierra Leone. The multiparty democratic [[constitution of Sierra Leone]] was adopted in 1991 by the government of President [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], Stevens' hand-picked successor, just as the rebel group [[Revolutionary United Front]] led by [[Foday Sankoh]] launched a brutal civil war in the country.\n\nOn 29 April 1992, a group of Junior soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army led by Captain [[Valentine Strasser]] overthrew President Momoh, and Sierra Leone was under Military rule from 1992 to 1996 during the civil war. The country returned to a democratically elected government when the military Junta under Brigadier General [[Julius Maada Bio]] handed the presidency to [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]] of the SLPP after his victory in the 1996 election. However, the Sierra Leone military overthrew President Kabbah in a coup on 25 May 1997, and Major General [[Johnny Paul Koroma]] became the country's head of state. A coalition of West African [[Ecowas]] armed forces led by [[Nigeria]] then reinstated President Kabbah by military force in February 1998, and the leaders of the coup were executed after they were sentenced to death by a Sierra Leone military court. In January 2002, President Kabbah announced the end of the civil war with the help of Ecowas, the British government, the African Union, and the United Nations. Sierra Leone has had an uninterrupted democratic government from 1998 to present.\n\nSixteen ethnic groups inhabit Sierra Leone, each with its own language and customs. The two largest and most influential are the [[Temne people|Temne]] and [[Mende people]]. The Temne are predominantly found in the northwest and the Mende in the southeast. About two percent of the population are the [[Krio people]], who are descendants of freed American and West Indian slaves. English is the official language used in schools and government administration, but [[Krio language|Krio]] is the most widely spoken language, an [[English-based creole]] used by 98 percent of the population. Krio unites all the ethnic groups in the country, especially in their trade and social interaction.\n\nSierra Leone is 77 percent Muslim, with an influential Christian minority of 22 percent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sierra Leone 2015 Population and Housing Census |url=https://www.statistics.sl/images/StatisticsSL/Documents/Census/2015/sl_2015_phc_thematic_report_on_pop_structure_and_pop_distribution.pdf |website=Statistics Sierra Leone}}</ref> The country is regarded as one of the most religiously tolerant countries in the world.

Although according to the [[professor]] C. Magbaily Fyle this could have been a misinterpretation of historians: according to him, there has been evidence of travellers calling the region ''Serra Lyoa'' well before 1462, the year when Sintra first arrived. This would imply that the identity of the person who named Sierra Leone is unknown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://slconcordtimes.com/pedro-da-cintra-did-not-name-sierra-leone-an-exploration-into-available-evidence/ |title=Pedro da \u00e7intra did not name Sierra Leone: An Exploration into available evidence |last= |first= |date=22 June 2017 |website= |publisher=Sierra Leone Concord Times |access-date=26 May 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nSoon after Sintra's expedition, Portuguese traders arrived at the harbour.

There were thousands of these [[Black Loyalists]], people of African descent who joined the British military forces during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>Cassandra Pybus, ''Epic Journeys of Freedom: Runaway Slaves of the American Revolution and Their Global Quest for Liberty,'' (Beacon Press, Boston, 2006); Graham Russell Hodges, Susan Hawkes Cook, Alan Edward Brown (eds), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2947159 ''The Black Loyalist Directory: African Americans in Exile After the American Revolution''] {{subscription required|via JSTOR}}</ref> Many of these [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] had been slaves who escaped to join the British, lured by promises of freedom ([[emancipation]]). The official documentation known as the [[Book of Negroes]] lists thousands of freed slaves whom the British evacuated from the nascent United States and resettled in colonies elsewhere in [[British North America]] (north to Canada, or south to the West Indies).\n\nIn 1787 the British Crown founded a settlement in Sierra Leone in what was called the \"[[Province of Freedom]]\". It intended to resettle some of the \"[[Black Poor]] of London\", some of whom were African-Americans freed by the British during the war. About 400 blacks and 60 whites reached Sierra Leone on 15 May 1787. The group also included some [[West Indies|West Indians]] of African descent from London. After they established [[Granville Town]], most of the first group of colonists died, owing to disease and warfare with the indigenous African peoples ([[Temne people|Temne]]), who resisted their encroachment. The 64&nbsp;remaining colonists established a second Granville Town.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Pham |first = John-Peter |title = Child Soldiers, Adult Interests: The Global Dimensions of the Sierra Leonean Tragedy |publisher = Nova Publishers |year = 2005 |pages = 4\u20138 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ZnPFKpwoIkIC&pg=PA4 |isbn = 978-1-59454-671-6 |accessdate = 17 June 2014}}</ref><ref>Michael Sivapragasam, ''Why Did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783\u20131815?''

They founded [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia]], but faced harsh winters and racial discrimination from nearby [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]]. [[Thomas Peters (black leader)|Thomas Peters]] pressed British authorities for relief and more aid; together with British abolitionist [[John Clarkson (abolitionist)|John Clarkson]], the [[Sierra Leone Company]] was established to relocate Black Loyalists who wanted to take their chances in West Africa. In 1792 nearly 1200&nbsp;persons from Nova Scotia crossed the Atlantic to build the second (and only permanent) Colony of Sierra Leone and the settlement of [[Freetown]] on 11 March 1792. In Sierra Leone they were called the [[Nova Scotian Settlers]], the ''Nova Scotians'', or the ''Settlers''.\n\nThe Settlers built Freetown in the styles they knew from their lives in the [[American South]]; they also continued American fashion and American manners. In addition, many continued to practice [[Methodism]] in Freetown. Black settlers in Sierra Leone enjoyed much more autonomy in that they were more politically engaged. Black immigrants elected different levels of political representatives, 'tithingmen', who represented each dozen settlers, and 'hundreders' who represented larger amounts. This sort of representation was not available in Nova Scotia.<ref>Gilbert, Alan. ''Black Patriots and Loyalists: Fighting for Emancipation in the War for Independence''. University of Chicago 2012, p. 229</ref> The initial process of society-building in Freetown, however, was a harsh struggle.

Led by Colonel Montague James, the Maroons helped the colonial forces to put down the revolt, and in the process they secured the best houses and farms.<ref>Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: 2005), pp. 380\u2013383.</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1808, [[Thomas Ludlam (colonialist)|Thomas Ludlam]], the Governor of the Sierra Leone Company and a leading abolitionist, surrendered the Company's charter. This ended its 16&nbsp;years of running the Colony. The British Crown reorganised the Sierra Leone Company as the [[African Institution]]; it was directed to improve the local economy. Its members represented both British who hoped to inspire local entrepreneurs and those with interest in the Macauley & Babington Company, which held the (British) monopoly on Sierra Leone trade.<ref>Harris, Sheldon H.

These Liberated Africans or ''[[recaptives]]'' were sold for $20 a head as apprentices to the white settlers, Nova Scotian Settlers, and the Jamaican Maroons.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Some of the recaptives who were not sold as apprentices were forced to join the Navy. Many recaptives were treated poorly and even abused because some of the original settlers considered them their property. Cut off from their various homelands and traditions, the Liberated Africans were forced to assimilate to the Western styles of Settlers and Maroons. For example, some of the recaptives were forced to change their name to a more Western sounding one. Though some people happily embraced these changes because they considered it as being part of the community, some were not happy with these changes and wanted to keep their own identity. Many recaptives were so unhappy that they risked the possibility of being sold back into slavery by leaving Sierra Leone and going back to their original villages.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Schwarz|first=Suzanne|date=5 January 2013|title=Reconstructing the Life Histories of Enslaved Africans: Sierra Leone, c. 1808\u201319|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267884583}}</ref> They built a flourishing trade in flowers and beads on the West African coast.\n\nThese returned Africans were from many areas of Africa, but principally the west coast. During the 19th century, freed black Americans, some [[Americo Liberian]] 'refugees', and particularly West Indians, also immigrated and settled in Freetown. Together these peoples created a new creole ethnicity called the [[Krio people]] (initially called Creoles) and a trading language, [[Krio language|Krio]], which became commonly used among many of the ethnicities in the country.\n\n=== Colonial era (1800\u20131961) ===\n\n{{Main|Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate}}\n\nThe settlement of Sierra Leone in the 1800s was unique in that the population was composed of displaced Africans who were brought to the colony after the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807. Upon arrival in Sierra Leone, each \"recaptive\" was given a registration number, and information on their physical qualities would be entered into the Register of Liberated Africans. However, oftentimes the documentation would be overwhelmingly subjective and would result in inaccurate entries, making them difficult to track. In addition, differences between the Register of Liberated Africans of 1808 and the List of Captured Negroes of 1812 (which emulated the 1808 document) revealed some disparities in the entries of the recaptives, specifically in the names; many recaptives decided to change their given names to more [[anglicised]] versions which contributed to the difficulty in tracking them after they arrived in Sierra Leone.\n\nAccording to the British Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807, the recaptives could be subject to apprenticeships led by British colonists in Sierra Leone and the males enlisted into the Army or Navy. In many instances, the recaptives who were assigned to apprenticeships were sold for $20, giving the apprenticeship system qualities similar to slavery.<ref name=\"Schwartz 2012\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Suzanne|date=2012|title=Reconstructing the Life Histories of Liberated Africans: Sierra Leone in the Early Nineteenth Century|url=|journal=History in Africa|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> It is documented that the recaptive apprentices were unpaid and the settlers who they were appointed to had devices which could be used to discipline them, namely sticks. According to Suzanne Schwartz, a historian on colonial Sierra Leone, in June 1808 a group of 21 men and women ran away to the nearby native settlement of Robiss and upon recapture were imprisoned by the settlers in Sierra Leone, thus contributing to the slavery-like qualities of the apprenticeship system.<ref name=\"Schwartz 2012\"/> [[File:Bai Bureh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Bai Bureh]], Temne leader of the [[Hut Tax War of 1898]] against British rule]]\n\nIn the early 19th century, Freetown served as the residence of the British colonial governor of the region, who also administered the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]) and the [[Gambia]] settlements. Sierra Leone developed as the educational centre of British West Africa. The British established [[Fourah Bay College]] here in 1827, which rapidly became a magnet for English-speaking Africans on the West Coast. For more than a century, it was the only European-style university in western [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].\n\n[[File:Bai Bureh (1898).jpg|thumb|Temne leader Bai Bureh seen here in 1898 after his surrender, sitting relaxed in his traditional dress with a handkerchief in his hands, while a Sierra Leonean [[Royal West African Frontier Force|Royal West African Frontier]] soldier stands guard next to him ]]\n\nThe British interacted mostly with the Krios in Freetown, who did most of the trading with the indigenous peoples of the interior. In addition, educated Krios held numerous positions in the colonial government, giving them status and good-paying positions. Following the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885, the UK decided that it needed to establish more dominion over the inland areas, to satisfy what was described by the European powers as \"effective occupation\" of territories. In 1896 it annexed these areas, declaring them the Sierra Leone Protectorate.<ref name=\"harris40\">Harris, David (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=B5RxmwC6aNwC&pg=PA1 ''Civil War and Democracy in West Africa: Conflict Resolution, Elections and Justice in Sierra Leone and Liberia''], I.B.

They designated chiefs as units of local government, rather than dealing with them individually as had been previous practice. They did not maintain relationships even with longtime allies, such as [[Bai Bureh]], chief of Kasseh, a community on the Small Scarcies River. He was later unfairly portrayed as a prime instigator of the Hut Tax war in 1898.<ref name=\"abraham\">{{cite journal\n  |title = Bai Bureh, The British, and the Hut Tax War\n  |last = Abraham\n  |first = Arthur\n  |journal = [[The International Journal of African Historical Studies]]\n  |issn = 0361-7882\n  |volume = 7\n  |issue = 1\n  |year = 1974\n  |pages = 99\u2013106\n  |doi = 10.2307/216556\n  |jstor = 216556\n  }}</ref>\n\nColonel Frederic Cardew, military governor of the Protectorate, in 1898 established a new tax on dwellings and demanded that the chiefs use their peoples to maintain roads. The taxes were often higher than the value of the dwellings, and 24 chiefs signed a petition to Cardew, stating how destructive this was; their people could not afford to take time off from their subsistence agriculture. They resisted payment of taxes. Tensions over the new colonial requirements, and the administration's suspicions about the chiefs led to the [[Hut Tax War of 1898|Hut Tax war of 1898]], also called the Temne-Mende War. The British fired first. The Northern front of majority Temne people was led by [[Bai Bureh]]. The Southern front, consisting mostly of [[Mende people]], entered conflict somewhat later and for different reasons.\n\nFor several months, Bureh's fighters had the advantage over the vastly more powerful British forces, but the British troops and Bureh's warriors suffered hundreds of fatalities.<ref>[http://www.sierra-leone.org/Heroes/heroes5.html History], Sierra-leone.org, Retrieved 17 January 2007.</ref> Bai Bureh finally surrendered on 11 November 1898 to end the destruction of his people's territory and dwellings.

The monopoly was scheduled to last 98 years. Mining of diamonds in the east and other minerals expanded, drawing labourers there from other parts of the country.\n\nIn 1924, the UK government divided Sierra Leone into a Colony and a Protectorate, with different political systems constitutionally defined for each. The Colony was Freetown and its coastal area; the Protectorate was defined as the hinterland areas dominated by local chiefs. Antagonism between the two entities escalated to a heated debate in 1947, when proposals were introduced to provide for a single political system for both the Colony and the Protectorate. Most of the proposals came from leaders of the Protectorate, whose population far outnumbered that in the colony. The Krios, led by [[I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson|Isaac Wallace-Johnson]], opposed the proposals, as they would have resulted in reducing the political power of the Krios in the Colony.\n\nIn 1951, educated protectorate leaders from different groups, including [[Sir]] [[Milton Margai]], [[Lamina Sankoh]], [[Siaka Stevens]], Mohamed Sanusi Mustapha, [[John Karefa-Smart]], Kande Bureh, Sir [[Albert Margai]], [[Amadu Wurie]] and Sir [[Banja Tejan-Sie]] joined together with the powerful [[paramount chiefs]] in the protectorate to form the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] or SLPP as the party of the protectorate.

Margai used his conservative ideology to lead Sierra Leone without much strife. He appointed government officials to represent various ethnic groups.

Sir Albert's leadership was briefly challenged by Foreign Minister [[John Karefa-Smart]], who questioned Sir Albert's succession to the SLPP leadership position. Karefa-Smart led a prominent small minority faction within the SLPP party in opposition of Albert Margai as Prime Minister. However, Kareefa-Smart failed to receive strong support within the SLPP and the SLPP dominated members of parliament in his attempt to have Albert Margai stripped of his position as the leader of the SLPP and prime minister of the country. The large majority of SLPP members backed Albert Margai over Kareefa-Smart. Soon after Albert Margai was sworn in as Prime Minister, he dismissed several senior government officials who had served under his elder brother Milton's government, viewing them as a threat to his administration, including Kareefa-Smart.\n\nSir Albert resorted to increasingly [[authoritarian]] actions in response to protests and enacted several laws against the opposition [[All People's Congress]] (APC), whilst attempting to establish a [[one-party state]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Sir Albert was opposed to the colonial legacy of allowing executive powers to the Paramount Chiefs, many of whom had been key allies of his late brother Sir Milton. Accordingly, they began to consider Sir Albert a threat to the ruling houses across the country. Margai appointed many non-Creoles to the country's [[civil service]] in [[Freetown]], in an overall diversification of the civil service in the capital, which had been dominated by members of the Creole ethnic group. As a result, Albert Margai became unpopular in the Creole community, many of whom had supported Sir Milton. Margai was accused of favoring members of his own Mende ethnic group for prominent positions.\n\nIn 1967, riots broke out in Freetown against Margai's policies; in response he declared a [[state of emergency]] across the country.

He was a close ally of Albert Margai, who had appointed him to the position in 1964. Lansana placed Stevens under [[house arrest]] in Freetown and insisted that the determination of Prime Minister should await the election of the tribal representatives to the House. Upon his release, Stevens went into exile in [[Guinea]].\n\nOn 23 March 1967, a group of military officers in the Sierra Leone Army led by Brigadier General [[Andrew Juxon-Smith]], overrode this action by a coup d'\u00e9tat; they seized control of the government, arresting Lansana, and suspending the constitution.

During his first decade or so in power, Stevens renegotiated some of what he called \"useless prefinanced schemes\" contracted by his predecessors, both Albert Margai of the SLPP and Juxon-Smith of the NRC. Some of these policies by the SLPP and the NRC were said to have left the country in an economically deprived state.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nStevens reorganised the country's oil refinery, the government-owned Cape Sierra Hotel, and a cement factory.<ref>David Harris.

Stevens began efforts that would later bridge the distance between the provinces and the city. Roads and hospitals were constructed in the provinces, and Paramount Chiefs and provincial peoples became a prominent force in Freetown.\n\nUnder pressure of several coup attempts, real or perceived, Stevens' rule grew more and more [[authoritarian]], and his relationship with some of his ardent supporters deteriorated. He removed the SLPP party from competitive politics in general elections, some believed, through the use of violence and intimidation. To maintain the support of the military, Stevens retained the popular John Amadu Bangura as the head of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces.\n\nAfter the return to civilian rule, by-elections were held (beginning in autumn 1968) and an all-APC cabinet was appointed. Calm was not completely restored. In November 1968, unrest in the provinces led Stevens to declare a state of emergency across the country. Many senior officers in the Sierra Leone Army were greatly disappointed with Stevens' policies and his handling of the Sierra Leone Military, but none could confront Stevens. Brigadier General Bangura, who had reinstated Stevens as Prime Minister, was widely considered the only person who could control Stevens. The army was devoted to Bangura, and this made him potentially dangerous to Stevens. In January 1970, Bangura was arrested and charged with [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] and plotting to commit a coup against the Stevens government. After a trial that lasted a few months, Bangura was [[convicted]] and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. On 29 March 1970, Brigadier Bangura was executed by hanging in Freetown.\n\nAfter the execution of Bangura, a group of soldiers loyal to the executed Brigadier Bangura held a [[mutiny]] in the capital Freetown and in some other parts of the country in opposition of Stevens' government. Dozens of soldiers were arrested and [[convicted]] by a [[court martial]] in Freetown for their participation in the mutiny against president Stevens. Among the soldiers arrested was a little known army [[Corporal]] [[Foday Sankoh]], a strong supporter of Bangura. Corporal Sankoh was convicted and jailed for seven years at the Pademba Road Prison in Freetown.\n\nIn April 1971, a new republican constitution was adopted under which Stevens became president. In the 1972 by-elections the opposition SLPP complained of intimidation and procedural obstruction by the APC and militia. These problems became so severe that the SLPP boycotted the [[Sierra Leonean general election, 1973|1973 general election]]; as a result the APC won 84 of the 85 elected seats.<ref>{{Cite book |last =Rotberg |first =Robert I. |title =State failure and state weakness in a time of terror |publisher = Brookings Institution Press|year =2003 |page = 80 |url =https://books.google.com/?id=oajfCpTpgCIC&pg=PA80|isbn = 978-0-8157-7574-4|accessdate = 17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAn alleged plot to overthrow president Stevens failed in 1974 and its leaders were executed. In mid 1974, Guinean soldiers, requested by Stevens, were in the country to help maintain his hold on power as Stevens was a close ally of then Guinean president [[Ahmed Sekou Toure]]. In March 1976, Stevens was elected without opposition for a second five-year term as president. On 19 July 1975, 14 senior army and government officials including David Lansana, former cabinet minister Mohamed Sorie Forna (father of writer [[Aminatta Forna]]), Brigadier General Ibrahim Bash Taqi and Lieutenant Habib Lansana Kamara were executed after being convicted of allegedly attempting a coup to topple president Stevens' government.\n\nIn 1977, a nationwide student demonstration against the government disrupted Sierra Leone politics. The demonstration was quickly put down by the army and Stevens' own personal Special Security Division (SSD) force, a heavily armed paramilitary force he had created to protect him and to maintain his hold on power.<ref>[http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/1669 Politicized security forces or tribalized national politics; which is which?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901024455/http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/1669 |date=1 September 2012 }}.

He built several government institutions that are still in use today.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Stevens also reduced ethnic polarisation in government by incorporating members of various ethnic groups into his all-dominant APC government.\n\nSiaka Stevens retired from politics in November 1985 after being in power for eighteen years. The APC named a new presidential candidate to succeed Stevens at their last delegate conference held in Freetown in November 1985. He was [[Major General]] [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], the head of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces and Stevens' own choice to succeed him. As head of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces, Major General Momoh was very loyal to Stevens, who had appointed him to the position. Like Stevens, Momoh was also a member of the minority [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]] ethnic group.\n\nMomoh was elected president as the only contesting candidate, without any opposition, and was sworn in as Sierra Leone's second president on 28 November 1985 in Freetown. A one-party parliamentary election between APC members was held in May 1986. President Momoh appointed his former military colleague and key ally, Major General Mohamed Tarawalie to succeed him as the head of the Sierra Leone Military. Major General Tarawalie was also a strong loyalist and key supporter of president Momoh. President Momoh named James Bambay Kamara as the head of the [[Sierra Leone Police]]. Bambay Kamara was a key loyalist and strong supporter of President Momoh. Momoh broke away from former president Siaka Stevens, by integrating the powerful SSD into the Sierra Leone Police as a special [[paramilitary force]] of the Sierra Leone Police. Under President Stevens, the SSD had been a powerful personal force used to maintain his hold on power, independent from the Sierra Leone Military and Sierra Leone Police Force. The Sierra Leone Police under Bambay Kamara's leadership, was accused of physical violence, arrest and intimidation against critics of President Momoh's government.\n\nPresident Momoh's strong links with the army and his verbal attacks on corruption earned him much-needed initial support among Sierra Leoneans. With the lack of new faces in the new APC cabinet under president Momoh and the return of many of the old faces from Stevens' government, criticisms soon arose that Momoh was simply perpetuating the rule of Stevens.\n\nThe next couple of years under the Momoh administration were characterised by corruption, which Momoh defused by sacking several senior cabinet ministers. To formalise his war against corruption, President Momoh announced a \"[[Code of Conduct]] for Political Leaders and Public Servants.\" After an alleged attempt to overthrow President Momoh in March 1987, more than 60 senior government officials were arrested, including Vice President [[Francis Minah]], who was removed from office, convicted of plotting the coup, and executed by [[hanging]] in 1989 along with 5 others.\n\n=== Sierra Leone Civil War (1991\u20132002) ===\n\n{{Further|Sierra Leone Civil War}}\n\n[[File:School destroyed by Sierra Leone Civil War.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A school in [[Koindu]] destroyed during the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Civil War]]; in total 1,270 primary schools were destroyed in the War.<ref name=\"ilab\"/>]]\n\nIn October 1990, owing to mounting pressure from both within and outside the country for political and economic reform, president Momoh set up a constitutional review commission to assess the 1978 one-party constitution. Based on the commission's recommendations a constitution re-establishing a multi-party system was approved by the exclusive APC Parliament by a 60% majority vote, becoming effective on 1 October 1991. There was great suspicion that president Momoh was not serious about his promise of political reform, as APC rule continued to be increasingly marked by abuses of power.\n\nThe brutal civil war that was going on in neighbouring [[Liberia]] played a significant role in the outbreak of fighting in Sierra Leone. [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] \u2013 then leader of the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] \u2013 reportedly helped form the [[Revolutionary United Front|Revolutionary United Front (RUF)]] under the command of former Sierra Leonean army [[corporal]] [[Foday Sankoh|Foday Saybana Sankoh]], an ethnic Temne from [[Tonkolili District]] in Northern Sierra Leone. Sankoh was a British trained former army corporal who had also undergone guerrilla training in Libya. Taylor's aim was for the RUF to attack the bases of Nigerian dominated peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone who were opposed to his rebel movement in Liberia.\n\nOn 29 April 1992, a group of young soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army, led by seven army officers \u2014 Lieutenant Sahr Sandy, Captain [[Valentine Strasser]], Sergeant [[Solomon Musa]], Captain [[Komba Mondeh]], Lieutenant [[Tom Nyuma]], Captain [[Julius Maada Bio]] and Captain Komba Kambo\u2014<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sl/drwebsite/exec/view.cgi?archive=2&num=106 |title=NPRC's Komba Kambo Speaks After Eleven Years Of Silence!: Sierra Leone News |publisher=News.sl |accessdate=17 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222185702/http://news.sl/drwebsite/exec/view.cgi?archive=2&num=106 |archivedate=22 February 2014}}</ref> launched a [[military coup]] that sent president Momoh into [[exile]] in Guinea, and the young soldiers established the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC), with 25-year-old Captain Valentine Strasser as its chairman and Head of State of the country.<ref name=\"blogspot1\">{{cite web|url=http://salonenow.blogspot.com/2011/08/attempts-to-launder-maada-bios-battered.html#!/2011/08/attempts-to-launder-maada-bios-battered.html |title=SIERRA LEONE NOW: Attempts To Launder Maada Bio's Battered Image Fail...

Strasser became the world's youngest Head of State when he seized power just three days after his 25th birthday. The NPRC junta established the National Supreme Council of State as the military highest command and final authority in all matters, and was exclusively made up of the highest ranking NPRC soldiers, included Strasser himself and the original soldiers who toppled president Momoh.<ref name=\"blogspot1\"/>\n\nOne of the highest ranking soldiers of the NPRC Junta, Lieutenant Sahr Sandy, a trusted ally of Strasser, was assassinated, allegedly by Major S.I.M. Turay, a key loyalist of ousted president Momoh. A heavily armed military manhunt took place across the country to find Lieutenant Sandy's killer. However, the main suspect, Major S.I.M Turay, went into hiding and fled the country to Guinea, fearing for his life. Dozens of soldiers loyal to the ousted president Momoh were arrested, including Colonel Kahota M. Dumbuya and Major Yayah Turay. Lieutenant Sandy was given a [[state funeral]] and his funeral prayers service at the [[cathedral]] church in Freetown was attended by many high-ranking soldiers of the NPRC junta, including Strasser himself and NPRC deputy leader Sergeant Solomon Musa.\n\nThe NPRC Junta immediately suspended the constitution, banned all political parties, limited [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]] and enacted a rule-by-decree policy, in which soldiers were granted unlimited powers of administrative detention without charge or trial, and challenges against such detentions in court were precluded.\n\nThe NPRC Junta maintained relations with the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and strengthened support for Sierra Leone-based [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|ECOMOG]] troops fighting in Liberia. On 28 December 1992, an alleged coup attempt against the NPRC government of Strasser, aimed at freeing the detained Colonel Yahya Kanu, Colonel Kahota M.S. Dumbuya and former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara, was foiled. Several Junior army officers led by Sergeant Mohamed Lamin Bangura were identified as being behind the coup plot. The coup plot led to the [[firing squad]] execution of seventeen soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army including Colonel Kahota M Dumbuya, Major Yayah Kanu and Sergeant Mohamed Lamin Bangura. Several prominent members of the Momoh government who had been in detention at the Pa Demba Road prison, including former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara, were also executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standardtimespress.org/artman/publish/article_4699.shtml |title=Standard Times Press Sierra Leone's NPRC's Ruthlessness No Death Certificates For 29 Sierra Leoneans |publisher=Standardtimespress.org |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 July 1994 the deputy NPRC leader Sergeant Solomon Musa, who was very popular with the general population, particularly in Freetown, was arrested and sent into exile after he was accused of planning a coup to topple Strasser, an accusation Sergeant Musa denied. Strasser replaced Musa as deputy NPRC chairman with Captain Julius Maada Bio, who was instantly promoted by Strasser to [[Brigadier]].\n\nThe NPRC proved to be nearly as ineffectual as the Momoh-led APC government in repelling the RUF. More and more of the country fell to RUF fighters, and by 1994 they held much of the diamond-rich Eastern Province and were at the edge of Freetown. In response, the NPRC hired several hundred mercenaries from the private firm [[Executive Outcomes]]. Within a month they had driven RUF fighters back to enclaves along Sierra Leone's borders, and cleared the RUF from the Kono diamond-producing areas of Sierra Leone.\n\nWith Strasser's two most senior NPRC allies and commanders Lieutenant Sahr Sandy and Lieutenant [[Solomon Musa]] no longer around to defend him, Strasser's leadership within the NPRC Supreme Council of State was not considered much stronger. On 16 January 1996, after about four years in power, Strasser was arrested in a palace coup at the Defence Headquarters in Freetown by his fellow NPRC soldiers.<ref name=\"FSL Vol 2 No 1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk/Vol2_1.htm |title=FSL Vol 2 No 1 |publisher=Focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk |accessdate=23 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928012312/http://www.focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk/Vol2_1.htm |archive-date=28 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Strasser was immediately flown into exile in a [[military helicopter]] to [[Conakry]], [[Guinea]].\n\nIn his first public broadcast to the nation following the 1996 coup, Brigadier Bio stated that his support for returning Sierra Leone to a democratically elected civilian government and his commitment to ending the civil war were his motivations for the coup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/How+Sierra+Leone+fell+into+the+hands+of+young+soldiers.-a0254314002 |title=How Sierra Leone fell into the hands of young soldiers|publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> Promises of a return to civilian rule were fulfilled by Bio, who handed power over to [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]], of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), after the conclusion of elections in early 1996. President Kabbah took power with a great promise of ending the civil war. President Kabbah opened [[dialogue]] with the RUF and invited RUF leader Foday Sankoh for peace negotiations.\n\nOn 25 May 1997, seventeen soldiers in the Sierra Leone army led by Corporal Tamba Gborie, loyal to the detained [[Major General]] [[Johnny Paul Koroma]], launched a military coup which sent President Kabbah into exile in Guinea and they established the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]] (AFRC). Corporal Gborie quickly went to the SLBS FM 99.9 headquarters in Freetown to announce the coup to a shocked nation and to alert all soldiers across the country to report for guard duty. The soldiers immediately released Koroma from prison and installed him as their chairman and Head of State.\n\nKoroma suspended the constitution, banned demonstrations, shut down all private radio stations in the country and invited the RUF to join the new junta government, with its leader Foday Sankoh as the Vice-Chairman of the new AFRC-RUF coalition junta government. Within days, Freetown was overwhelmed by the presence of the RUF combatants who came to the city in thousands. The Kamajors, a group of traditional fighters mostly from the Mende ethnic group under the command of deputy [[Defence Minister]] [[Samuel Hinga Norman]], remained loyal to President Kabbah and defended the Southern part of Sierra Leone from the soldiers.\n\n=== Kabbah's government and the end of civil war (2002\u20132014) ===\n\n{{update|section|date=February 2013}}\n\nAfter nine months in office, the junta was overthrown by the Nigerian-led [[ECOMOG]] forces, and the democratically elected government of president Kabbah was reinstated in February 1998. On 19 October 1998 24 soldiers in the Sierra Leone army were executed by firing squad after they were convicted in a [[court martial]] in Freetown, some for orchestrating the 1997 coup that overthrew President Kabbah and others for failure to reverse the mutiny.<ref>[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr51/019/1998/en/ Document \u2013 Sierra Leone: Imminent execution / death penalty / legal concern |Amnesty International] .

The first of the 6,000-member force began arriving in December, and the [[UN Security Council]] voted in February 2000 to increase the force to 11,000, and later to 13,000. But in May, when nearly all [[Nigeria]]n forces had left and UN forces were trying to disarm the RUF in eastern Sierra Leone, [[Foday Sankoh|Sankoh]]'s forces clashed with the UN troops, and some 500 peacekeepers were taken [[hostage]] as the peace accord effectively collapsed. The hostage crisis resulted in more fighting between the RUF and the government as UN troops launched [[Operation Khukri]] to end the siege. The Operation was successful with Indian and British [[Special Forces]] being the main contingents.\n\nThe situation in the country deteriorated to such an extent that British troops were deployed in [[Operation Palliser]], originally simply to evacuate foreign nationals. However, the British exceeded their original mandate, and took full military action to finally defeat the rebels and restore order. The British were the catalyst for the ceasefire that ended the civil war. Elements of the [[British Army]], together with administrators and politicians, remain in Sierra Leone to this day,{{when|date=October 2019}} helping train the armed forces, improve the infrastructure of the country and administer financial and material aid. [[Tony Blair]], the Prime Minister of Britain at the time of the British intervention, is regarded as a hero by the people of Sierra Leone, many of whom are keen for more British involvement.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Sierra Leoneans have been described{{by whom|date=October 2019}} as \"The World's Most Resilient People\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bah|first=M.|title=The Worlds Most Resilient People|year=1998|publisher=Alpha|location=London}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1991 and 2001, about [[List of wars by death toll|50,000 people were killed]] in Sierra Leone's civil war. Hundreds of thousands of people were forced from their homes and many became refugees in [[Guinea]] and [[Liberia]]. In 2001, UN forces moved into rebel-held areas and began to disarm rebel soldiers. By January 2002, the war was declared over. In May 2002, [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah|Kabbah]] was re-elected president by a landslide. By 2004, the disarmament process was complete. Also in 2004, a UN-backed [[war crime]]s court began holding trials of senior leaders from both sides of the war. In December 2005, UN peacekeeping forces pulled out of Sierra Leone.\n\nIn August 2007, Sierra Leone held presidential and parliamentary elections. However, no presidential candidate won the 50% plus one vote majority stipulated in the constitution on the first round of voting. A runoff election was held in September 2007, and [[Ernest Bai Koroma]], the candidate of the main opposition APC, was elected president.

Sierra Leone Police was established by the [[British colony]] in 1894; it is one of the oldest police forces in West Africa. It works to prevent crime, protect life and property, detect and prosecute offenders, maintain [[public order]], ensure safety and security, and enhance access to justice. The Sierra Leone Police is headed by the [[Inspector General of Police]], the professional head of the Sierra Leone Police force, who is appointed by the [[President of Sierra Leone]].\n\nEach one of [[Districts of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone's 14 districts]] is headed by a district police commissioner who is the professional head of their respective district.

A key indicator of success will be the effectiveness of government management of its diamond sector.\n\nThere is high unemployment, particularly among the youth and ex-combatants. Authorities have been slow to implement reforms in the civil service, and the pace of the privatisation programme is also slackening and donors have urged its advancement.\n\nThe currency is the [[Sierra Leonean leone|leone]]. The [[central bank]] is the [[Bank of Sierra Leone]]. Sierra Leone operates a floating [[exchange rate]] system, and foreign currencies can be exchanged at any of the commercial banks, recognised foreign exchange [[Service bureau|bureaux]] and most hotels.

The country is among the top ten diamond producing nations. Mineral exports remain the main [[currency]] earner. Sierra Leone is a major producer of gem-quality diamonds. Though rich in diamonds, it has historically struggled to manage their exploitation and export.\n\nSierra Leone is known for its [[blood diamond]]s that were mined and sold to diamond conglomerates during the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]], to buy the weapons that fuelled its atrocities.<ref>{{cite news|title=UN targets 'blood diamonds' trade|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3117421.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=28 April 2011|date=1 August 2003}}</ref> In the 1970s and early 1980s, economic growth rate slowed because of a decline in the mining sector and increasing corruption among government officials.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable infobox\" style=\"margin-right: 0; margin-left: 1em; text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size: 115%;\" |Percentage of GDP by sector (2007)<ref name=\"AFEC\"/>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Rank\n! scope=\"col\" |Sector\n! scope=\"col\" |Percentage<br/> of GDP\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1\n|Agriculture\n|58.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2\n|Other services\n|10.4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |3\n|Trade and tourism\n|9.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |4\n|Wholesale and retail trade\n|9.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |5\n|Mining and quarrying\n|4.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |6\n|Government Services\n|4.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |7\n|Manufacturing and handicrafts\n|2.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |8\n|Construction\n|1.7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |9\n|Electricity and water\n|0.4\n|}\n\nAnnual production of Sierra Leone's diamond estimates range between US$250 million\u2013$300&nbsp;million. Some of that is [[Smuggling|smuggled]], where it is possibly used for [[money laundering]] or financing illicit activities. Formal exports have dramatically improved since the civil war, with efforts to improve the management of them having some success. In October 2000, a UN-approved certification system for exporting diamonds from the country was put in place and led to a dramatic increase in legal exports. In 2001, the government created a mining community development fund ([[Ministry of Mineral Resources (Sierra Leone)|DACDF]]), which returns a portion of diamond export taxes to diamond mining communities. The fund was created to raise local communities' stake in the legal diamond trade.\n\nSierra Leone has one of the world's largest deposits of [[rutile]], a [[titanium]] ore used as [[paint]] pigment and [[welding]] rod coatings.\n\n=== Transport infrastructure ===\n\n{{Main|Transport in Sierra Leone}}\n\n[[File:Kenema-Kailahun Road.jpg|thumb|The road from [[Kenema]] to [[Kailahun District]]]]\n\nThere are a number of systems of transport in Sierra Leone, which has a road, air and water infrastructure, including a network of highways and several airports. There are {{convert|11,300|km|abbr=off}} of highways in Sierra Leone, of which {{convert|904|km|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"CIA\"/> are paved (about 8% of the roads). Sierra Leone's highways are linked to [[Conakry]], Guinea, and [[Monrovia]], Liberia.\n\nSierra Leone has the largest [[natural harbour]] on the African continent, allowing international shipping through the [[Queen Elizabeth II Quay]] in the [[Cline Town, Sierra Leone|Cline Town]] area of eastern Freetown or through Government Wharf in central Freetown. There are {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} of waterways in Sierra Leone, of which {{convert|600|km|0|abbr=on}} are navigable year-round. Major port cities are [[Bonthe]], [[Freetown]], [[Sherbro Island]] and [[Pepel]].\n\nThere are ten [[regional airport]]s in Sierra Leone, and one [[international airport]]. The [[Lungi International Airport]] located in the coastal town of [[Lungi, Sierra Leone|Lungi]] in Northern Sierra Leone is the primary airport for domestic and international travel to or from Sierra Leone. Passengers cross the river to Aberdeen [[Heliport]]s in Freetown by [[hovercraft]], ferry or a [[helicopter]]. Helicopters are also available from the airport to other major cities in the country. The airport has [[Pavement (material)|paved]] runways longer than {{convert|3,047|m|abbr=off}}. The other airports have unpaved runways, and seven have runways from {{convert|914|to|1,523|m|abbr=off}} long; the remaining two have shorter runways.\n\nSierra Leone appears on the EU list of prohibited countries with regard to the certification of airlines. This means that no airline registered in Sierra Leone may operate services of any kind within the European Union. This is due to substandard safety standards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/pdf/list_en.pdf |title=List of banned E.U. air carriers |accessdate=11 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325010606/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/pdf/list_en.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009  }}. ec.europa.eu</ref>\n\nAs of May 2014 the country's only [[Lungi International Airport|international airport]] had regularly scheduled direct flights to London, Paris, Brussels and most major cities in West Africa.\n\nIn September 2014 there were many Districts with travel restrictions including Kailahun, Kenema, Bombali, Tonkolili, and Port Loko because of [[Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra Leone|Ebola]].<ref>[http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200526223.shtml Sierra Leone News : Africell Presents Second Consignment of Food to all Quarantined Homes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006141855/http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200526223.shtml |date=6 October 2014 }}.

Recently there has been an increase of [[Pentecostal]] churches, especially in Freetown.\n\nIn September 2017, a Sierra Leone-based Nigerian [[Pentecostal]] Christian pastor name Victor Ajisafe was arrested by the [[Sierra Leone Police]] and held in [[jail]] after he preached an extreme [[religious intolerance]] and a [[fanatical]] [[hate speech]] against [[Islam]] and Sierra Leonean Muslims in particular at his church [[sermon]] in the capital [[Freetown]]. Ajisafe was apparently angry and [[jealous]] after a [[Zimbabwean]] internationally renowned Muslim [[cleric]] [[Mufti Menk]] visited Sierra Leone and had approximately over one hundred thousand people in and outside the national stadium in Freetown to listen to his Islamic sermon in his visit to Sierra Leone on 21 to 23 September 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ayvnews.com/AYVNews/index.php/news/item/4084-mufti-menk-s-visit-to-sierra-loenep |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401173250/http://ayvnews.com/AYVNews/index.php/news/item/4084-mufti-menk-s-visit-to-sierra-loenep |archive-date=1 April 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many Christian organizations in Sierra Leone, including the Council of Churches condemned Ajisafe's sermon against Islam and Muslims. Ajisafe\"s church was temporarily shut down by the Sierra Leone government and his church license was temporarily suspended too. The incident brought religious tension in Sierra Leone, in a country known for its very high level of religious tolerance, as many Sierra Leonean Muslims at home and abroad were extremely angry, many called for Ajisafe to be [[deported]] back to his home country of [[Nigeria]]. The pastor while in Sierra Leone [[police custody]] apologized to Sierra Leonean Muslims and to the government of Sierra Leone. After several days in jail, Ajisafe was released, his church license was given back to him, and his church was later reopened under strict government condition during several months of [[probation]].\n\n[[Nondenominational Christianity|Non-denominational Protestants]] form a significant minority of Sierra Leone's Christian population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=11887 |title=Sierra Leone: in wake of brutal war, churches full: News Headlines |publisher=Catholic Culture |date=28 September 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref> [[Catholics]] are the largest group of non-Protestant Christians in Sierra Leone, forming about 8% of Sierra Leone's population and 26% of the Christian population in Sierra Leone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicchurchsl.org/ |title=catholicchurchsl.org |publisher=catholicchurchsl.org |accessdate=20 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504130803/http://www.catholicchurchsl.org/ |archive-date=4 May 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/offices/sierra-leone/ |title=Visitors & Tours: Jehovahs Witnesses Office in Sierra Leone |publisher=Jw.org |accessdate=23 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005142744/http://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/offices/sierra-leone/ |archive-date=5 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics/country/sierra-leone |title=Sierra Leone \u2013 LDS Statistics and Church Facts &#124; Total Church Membership |publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org |date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Gerry Avant |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765616902/Historic-milestone-Sierra-Leone-stake-marks-LDS-Churchs-3000th.html?pg=all |title=Historic milestone: Sierra Leone stake marks LDS Church's 3,000th |newspaper=Deseret News |date=2 December 2012 |accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref> are the two most prominent [[Nontrinitarianism|non Trinitarian]] Christians in Sierra Leone, and they form a small but significant minority of the Christian population in Sierra Leone.

The largest and most influential are the [[Mende people|Mende]] at about 32.2% and the [[Temne people|Temne]] at about 31.6%. The Temne predominate in the [[Northern Province, Sierra Leone|Northern Sierra Leone]] and the [[Western Area, Sierra Leone|some areas around the capital of Sierra Leone]]. The Mende predominate in [[Southern Province, Sierra Leone|South]]-Eastern Sierra Leone (with the exception of [[Kono District]]).\n\nThe vast majority of Temne are Muslims at over 85%; and with a significant Christian minority at about 10%. The Mende are also Muslim majority at about 70%, though with a large Christian minority at about 30%. Sierra Leone's national politics centres on the competition between the north-west, dominated by the Temne, and the south-east dominated by the Mende. The vast majority of the Mende support the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP); while the majority of the Temne support the [[All People's Congress]] (APC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewpeople.com/national-news/politics/item/1764-sierra-leone-the-temnes-and-the-politics-of-the-all-peoples%E2%80%99-congress-apc |title=Sierra Leone: The Temnes and the Politics of the All Peoples' Congress (APC) |publisher=Thenewpeople.com |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Mende, who are believed to be descendants of the [[Mane people|Mane]], originally occupied the Liberian hinterland. They began moving into Sierra Leone slowly and peacefully in the eighteenth century. The Temne are said to migrated from [[Futa Jallon]], which is in present-day [[Guinea]].\n\nThe third-largest ethnic group are the [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]] at about 8.4% of the population. The Limba are [[indigenous peoples|native]] people of Sierra Leone. They have no tradition of origin, and it is believed that they have lived in Sierra Leone since before the European encounter. The Limba are primarily found in Northern Sierra Leone, particularly in [[Bombali District|Bombali]], [[Kambia District|Kambia]] and [[Koinadugu District]]. The Limba are about 60% Christian and 40% Muslims. The Limba are close political allies of the neighbouring Temne.\n\nSince Independence, the Limba have traditionally been very influential in Sierra Leone's politics, along with the Mende. The vast majority of Limba support the All People's Congress (APC) political party. Sierra Leone's first and second presidents, [[Siaka Stevens]] and [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], respectively, were both ethnic Limba. Sierra Leone's current [[Defense Minister]] [[Paolo Conteh|Alfred Paolo Conteh]] is an ethnic Limba.\n \nOne of the biggest minority ethnic groups are the [[Fula people|Fula]] at around 3.8% of the population. Descendants of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Fula migrant settlers from the [[Fouta Djalon]] region of Guinea, they live primarily in the northeast and the western area of Sierra Leone. The Fula are virtually all Muslims at over 99%. The Fula are primarily [[merchant|traders]], and many live in middle-class homes. Because of their trading, the Fulas are found in nearly all parts of the country.\n\nThe other ethnic groups are the [[Mandingo people of Sierra Leone|Mandingo]] (also known as [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]]). They are descendants of [[Merchant|traders]] from Guinea who migrated to Sierra Leone during the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. The Mandika are predominantly found in the east and the northern part of the country. They predominate in the large towns, most notably [[Karina, Sierra Leone|Karina]], in Bombali District in the north; [[Kabala, Sierra Leone|Kabala]] and [[Falaba]] in Koinadugu District in the north; and [[Yengema]], [[Kono District]] in the east of the country. Like the Fula, the Mandinka are virtually all Muslims at over 99\u2105. Sierra Leone's third president [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]], and Sierra Leone's first Vice-President [[Sorie Ibrahim Koroma]] were both ethnic Mandingo.\n\nNext in proportion are the [[Kono people|Kono]], who live primarily in [[Kono District]] in Eastern Sierra Leone. The Kono are descendants of migrants from Guinea; today their workers are known primarily as diamond miners. The majority of the Kono ethnic group are Christians, though with an influential Muslim minority. Sierra Leone's former Vice-President [[Samuel Sam-Sumana|Alhaji Samuel Sam-Sumana]] is an ethnic Kono.\n\nThe small but significant [[Krio people]] (descendants of freed African American, [[West Indian]] and Liberated African slaves who settled in Freetown between 1787 and about 1885) make up about 3% of the population. They primarily occupy the capital city of [[Freetown]] and its surrounding [[Western Area]]. Krio culture reflects the Western culture and ideals within which many of their ancestors originated \u2013 they also had close ties with British officials and colonial administration during years of development.\n\nThe Krio have traditionally dominated Sierra Leone's judiciary and Freetown's elected city council. One of the first ethnic groups to become educated according to Western traditions, they have traditionally been appointed to positions in the civil service, beginning during the colonial years. They continue to be influential in the civil service. The vast majority of Krios are Christians at about 90%, though with a small but significant Muslim minority at 10% known locally as Oku.\n\nOther minority ethnic groups are the [[Kuranko people|Kuranko]], who are related to the Mandingo, and are largely Muslims. The Kuranko are believed to have begun arriving in Sierra Leone from Guinea in about 1600 and settled in the north, particularly in [[Koinadugu District]]. The Kuranko are primarily farmers; leaders among them have traditionally held several senior positions in the Military. The current Governor of the [[Bank of Sierra Leone]] [[Kaifala Marah]] is an ethnic Kuranko. The Kuranko are largely Muslim majority.\n\nThe [[Loko people|Loko]] in the north are native people of Sierra Leone, believed to have lived in Sierra Leone since the time of European encounter. Like the neighbouring Temne, the Loko are Muslim majority. The [[Susu people|Susu]] and their related [[Yalunka people|Yalunka]] The Susu and their related Yalunka are traders; both groups are primarily found in the far north in Kambia and Koinadugu District close to the border with Guinea. The Susu and Yalunka kingdom was established in the early 5th 7th century before Mali empire, which was extended from Mali, Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Guinea Conakry to the northern part of Sierra Leone. They are the original owners of the Futa Djallon region covered by a vars land area both the Susu and Yalunka people are descendants of the Mande people. They are virtually all Muslims. The Yalunka, also spelled Jallonke, Yalonga, Djallonk\u00e9, Djallonka or Dialonk\u00e9, are a Mande people who have lived in the Djallon, a mountainous region in Sierra Leone, Mali, Senegal, Guinea Bissau and Guinea Conakry West Africa over 520 years ago. The name Yalunka literally means \"inhabitants of the Jallon (mountains).\" Manga Sewa was born in Falaba, Solima chiefdom, in the Northern Province of British Sierra Leone to Yalunka parents. His father was a Yalunka paramount chief of Solima, a prosperous chieftaincy. Its capital, Falaba, was on the rich trading routes leading to the coast. Manga Sewa's father had a number of wives and dozens of children.are traders; both groups are primarily found in the far north in [[Kambia District|Kambia]] and Koinadugu District close to the border with Guinea. The Susu and Yalunka are both descendants of migrants from Guinea; and they both are virtually all Muslims at over 99%.\n\nThe [[Kissi people|Kissi]] live further inland in South-Eastern Sierra Leone. They predominate in the large town of [[Koindu]] and its surrounding areas in Kailahun District. The vast majority of Kissi are Christians. The much smaller [[Vai people|Vai]] and [[Kru people|Kru]] peoples are primarily found in [[Kailahun District|Kailahun]] and Pujehun Districts near the border with Liberia. The Kru predominate in the Kroubay neighbourhood in the capital Freetown. The Vai are largely Muslim majority at about 90%, while the Kru are virtually all Christians at over 99%.\n\nOn the coast in [[Bonthe District]] in the south are the [[Sherbro people|Sherbro]]. Native to Sierra Leone, they have occupied [[Sherbro Island]] since it was founded. The Sherbro are primarily [[fisherman]] and [[farmers]], and they are predominantly found in Bonthe District. The Sherbro are virtually all Christians, and their paramount chiefs had a history of intermarriage with British colonists and traders.\n\nA small number of Sierra Leoneans are of partial or full [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] ancestry, descendants of traders who first came to the nation in the 19th century. They are locally known as Sierra Leonean-Lebanese. The Sierra Leonean-Lebanese community are primarily traders and they mostly live in middle-class households in the urban areas, primarily in [[Freetown]], [[Bo, Sierra Leone|Bo]], [[Kenema]], [[Koidu|Koidu Town]] and [[Makeni]].\n\n== Gender equality ==\n\n=== Household ===\n\nAlthough women account for about 50 percent of the population in Sierra Leone, only 28 percent are household heads.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.statistics.sl/images/StatisticsSL/Documents/Census/2015/sl_2015_phc_thematic_report_on_gender.pdf|title=Sierra Leone 2015 Population and Housing Census Thematic Report on Gender |last=Fatou Taqi |author2=Marian Vinnie-Wilson |author3=Alimatu Vandi |first=Fatou, Marian, Alimatu|date=2015|website=|access-date=}}</ref> As in the rest of the countries, education is a key factor in succeeding in aspects such as a well-paid job and covering the needs of a house.

Stations mainly consist of local commercial stations with a limited broadcast range, combined with a few stations with national coverage \u2013 [[Capital Radio Sierra Leone]] being the largest of the commercial stations.\n\nThe United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) ran one of the most popular stations in the country, broadcasting programs in a range of languages. The UN mission were restructured in 2008 and it was decided that the UN Radio would be merged with SLBS to form the new Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC). This merger eventually happened in 2011 after the necessary legislation was enacted. SLBC transmits radio on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and has two television services, one of which is uplinked by satellite for international consumption. FM relays of [[BBC World Service]] (in Freetown, Bo, Kenema and Makeni), [[Radio France Internationale]] (Freetown only) and [[Voice of America]] (Freetown only) are also broadcast.\n\nOutside the capital Freetown and other major cities, television is not watched by a great many people, although Bo, Kenema and Makeni are served by their own relays of the main SLBC service. There are three free terrestrial television stations in Sierra Leone, one run by the government SLBC and the other two are private stations in Freetown, Star TV which is run by the owner of the ''Standard Times'' newspaper and AYV - Africa Young Voices. There are a number of religious funded TV stations that operate intermittently. Two other commercial TV operators (ABC and AIT) closed after they were not profitable. In 2007, a pay-per-view service was also introduced by GTV as part of a pan-African television service in addition to the nine-year-old sub-Saharan Digital satellite television service (DStv) originating from Multichoice Africa in South Africa. GTV subsequently went out of business, leaving DStv as the only provider of subscription satellite television in the country. A number of organisations planned to operate digital terrestrial subscription TV services, with Multichoice's Go TV having built infrastructure ahead of getting a licence and ultimately failing to get a license. ITV and SATCON are currently operational.\n\nInternet access in Sierra Leone has been sparse but is on the increase, especially since the introduction of 3G/4G cellular phone services across the country. There are several main [[internet service providers]] (ISPs) operating in the country. Freetown has [[internet caf\u00e9s]] and other businesses offering internet access. Problems experienced with access to the Internet include an intermittent electricity supply and a slow connection speed in the country outside Freetown.\n\n=== Arts ===\n\n{{Further|Art in Sierra Leone|Music of Sierra Leone}}\n\nThe arts in Sierra Leone are a mixture of tradition and hybrid African and western styles.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Banham|first = Martin |title = A history of theatre in Africa|publisher =Cambridge University Press |year =2004|page = 171|url =https://books.google.com/?id=RZXtk9bCZ-8C&pg=PA171|isbn=978-0-521-80813-2|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last =Conteh |first = Prince Sorie |title = Traditionalists, Muslims, and Christians in Africa: interreligious encounters and dialogue|publisher =Cambria Press |year =2009|pages = 23\u201324|url =https://books.google.com/?id=HpAuyiMRTDcC&pg=PA23|isbn=978-1-60497-596-3|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last =Manson |first =Katrina |first2=James |last2=Knight |title = Sierra Leone|publisher = Bradt Travel Guides|year =2009|pages = 42\u201345|url =https://books.google.com/?id=VxRcEzkFs-wC&pg=PA43|isbn=978-1-84162-222-4|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Temne.

Children, youth and adult are frequently seen playing [[street football]] across Sierra Leone. There are organised youth and adult football tournaments across the country, and there are various primary and secondary schools with football teams across Sierra Leone.\n\nThe Sierra Leone national football team, popularly known as the [[Leone Stars]], represents the country in international competitions. It has never qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] but participated in the [[1994 African Cup of Nations|1994]] and [[1996 African Cup of Nations]]. When the national football team, the Leone Stars, have a match, Sierra Leoneans across the country come together united in support of the national team and people rush to their local radio and television stations to follow the live match. The country's national television network, The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) broadcasts the national football team live match, along with many local radio stations across the country.\n\nWhen the Leone Stars win an important match, many youth across the county rush to the street to celebrate. Many of the Sierra Leone national team footballers play for teams based in Europe although virtually all of them started professional football in the [[Sierra Leone National Premier League]]. Many of the national team footballers are celebrities across Sierra Leone and they are often well known by the general population. Some of Sierra Leonean international footballers include [[Mohamed Kallon]], [[Mohamed Bangura (footballer)|Mohamed Bangura]], [[Rodney Strasser]], [[Kei Kamara]], [[Ibrahim Teteh Bangura]], [[Mustapha Dumbuya]], [[Christian Caulker]], [[Al Bangura|Alhassan Bangura]], [[Sheriff Suma]], [[Mohamed Kamara]], [[Umaru Bangura]] and [[Julius Wobay|Julius Gibrilla Woobay]].\n\nThe [[Sierra Leone National Premier League]] is the top professional football league in Sierra Leone and is controlled by the [[Sierra Leone Football Association]]. Fourteen clubs from across the country compete in the Sierra Leone Premier League. The two biggest and most successful football clubs are [[East End Lions]] and [[Mighty Blackpool]]. East End Lions and Mighty Blackpool have an intense rivalry and when they play each other the national stadium in Freetown is often sold out and supporters of both clubs often clash with each other before and after the game. There is a huge police presence inside and outside the national stadium during a match between the two great rivals to prevent a clash. Many Sierra Leonean youth follow the local football league.\n\nMany Sierra Leonean youth, children and adults follow the major football leagues in Europe, particularly the English [[Premier League]], Italian [[Serie A]], Spanish [[La Liga]], German [[Bundesliga]] and French [[Ligue 1]].\n\nThe [[Sierra Leone cricket team]] represents Sierra Leone in international cricket competitions, and is among the best in West Africa. It became an affiliate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] in 2002. It made its international debut at the 2004 African Affiliates Championship, where it finished last of eight teams. But at the equivalent tournament in 2006, Division Three of the African region of the World Cricket League, it finished as runner-up to [[Mozambique]], and just missed a promotion to Division Two.\n\nIn 2009, the Sierra Leone Under-19 team finished second in the African Under-19 Championship in Zambia, thus qualifying for the Under-19 World Cup qualifying tournament with nine other teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/other/content/story/403002.html |title=Cricinfo article Uganda and Sierra Leone Win Through |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> However, the team was unable to obtain Canadian visas to play in the tournament, which was held in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/other/content/story/423890.html |title=Visa Issues End Sierra Leone's World Cup Dream |publisher=Cricinfo article |date=7 September 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nBasketball is not a very popular sport in Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leone national basketball team represents Sierra Leone in international men's basketball competitions and is controlled by the Sierra Leone Basketball Federation.\n\nThe [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is popular among a small portion of the youth population. NBA superstars [[LeBron James]], [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Kevin Durant]] are popular among Sierra Leone's youthful population. Former NBA stars, in particular [[Michael Jordan]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Allen Iverson]] and [[Magic Johnson]] are popular in the country. Michael Jordan in particular is the most famous basketball player in the country and he is very popular among the general population. Current NBA youngstar [[Victor Oladipo]] is of Sierra Leonean descent, as his father is a native of Sierra Leone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-26/sports/38042288_1_dematha-gym-dunk-contest/2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519112746/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-26/sports/38042288_1_dematha-gym-dunk-contest/2 |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 May 2013 |title=Washington Post: Breaking News, World, US, DC News & Analysis |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=12 September 2013 |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough tennis is not very popular in the country, up-and-coming American player [[Frances Tiafoe]] is the son of two Sierra Leoneans who emigrated to the United States.\n\nSierra Leone is the first African country to join the [[International Floorball Federation]].\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Sierra Leone|Africa}}\n\n*[[Index of Sierra Leone-related articles]]\n\n*[[Outline of Sierra Leone]]\n\n*[[2014 Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra Leone]]\n\n*{{Books-inline|Sierra Leone}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n===Further reading===\n\n*Acemoglu, Daron, Tristan Reed, and James A.

Barrie describes her as \"a princess in her own right. The most beautiful of dusky Dianas and the belle of the Piccaninnies, coquettish, cold and amorous by turns.\"<ref>J.M. Barrie. ''Peter and Wendy'' Chapter 5. Hodder & Stoughton (1911)</ref>. She is apparently old enough to be married, but refuses any suitors because of her feelings towards Peter. She is jealous of [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]] and [[Tinker Bell]]. Tiger Lily is kidnapped by [[Captain Hook]] and his pirates but is rescued by Peter Pan.\n\n==In other media==\n\nIn the 1924 silent film [[Peter Pan (1924 film)|Peter Pan]], she is played by [[Anna May Wong]].\n\nIn the Disney animated film of the [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|same name]], Captain Hook kidnaps Tiger Lily which leads her father Big Chief to suspect that the Lost Boys were responsible. Hook leaves her to drown  at Skull Rock, but she is saved by Peter, who brings her back to her tribe. While the Indians celebrate, Wendy becomes jealous of Tiger Lily for flirting with Peter.\n\nTiger Lily appears in ''[[Peter Pan & the Pirates]]'' voiced by [[Cree Summer]]. She and her brother Hard-to-Hit sometimes tag along with and aid their friends Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, the Darling children and the Lost Boys on their many adventures.\n\nIn [[P.J.

The backpack has a specified minimum weight.

In 1934, the Waffenlauf of [[Frauenfeld]] was created, which is run over the [[Marathon distance]], on a course that features several kilometres of dirt roads as well as 520 m (1706 ft) of ascents.

{"title_page": "Parable of the Good Samaritan", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Good Samaritan||The Good Samaritan (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:Jordaens Podhorce.jpg|thumb|280px|''The Good Samaritan'' by [[Jacob Jordaens]], c. 1616]] \nThe '''parable of the Good Samaritan''' is a [[Parables of Jesus|parable told by Jesus]] in the [[Gospel of Luke]].<ref>{{bibleverse|Luke|10:25\u201337|NIV}}.</ref> It is about a traveller who is stripped of clothing, beaten, and left half dead alongside the road. First a [[Kohen|priest]] and then a [[Levite]] comes by, but both avoid the man. Finally, a [[Samaritan]] happens upon the traveller. Samaritans and Jews despised each other, but the Samaritan helps the injured man. [[Jesus]] is described as telling the [[parable]] in response to the question from a lawyer, \"And who is my neighbour?\". In response, Jesus tells the parable, the conclusion of which is that the neighbour figure in the parable is the man who shows mercy to the injured man\u2014that is, the Samaritan.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Exposition of the Old Testament|last=Gill|first=John|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-0801037566|location=|date=1980|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSome Christians, such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], have interpreted the parable allegorically, with the Samaritan representing Jesus Christ, who saves the sinful soul.<ref name=\"Caird, G. B. 1980 p. 165\">Caird, G. B. (1980). The Language and Imagery of the Bible. Duckworth. p. 165.</ref> Others, however, discount this [[allegory]] as unrelated to the parable's original meaning<ref name=\"Caird, G. B. 1980 p. 165\"/> and see the parable as exemplifying the ethics of Jesus.<ref name = \"Sanders p6\">Sanders, E. P. The historical figure of Jesus. Penguin, 1993. p. 6.</ref>\n\nThe parable has inspired painting, sculpture, satire, poetry, photography, and film. The phrase \"[[Wikt: Good Samaritan|good Samaritan]]\", meaning someone who helps a stranger, derives from this parable, and many [[Good Samaritan Hospital (disambiguation)|hospitals]] and charitable organizations are named after the Good Samaritan.\n\n==Narrative==\nIn the [[Luke 10|Gospel of Luke chapter 10]], the parable is introduced by a question, known as the [[Great Commandment]]:\n\n{{quotation||Luke 10:25-29, [[World English Bible]]|text=Behold, a certain [[Rabbi|lawyer]]  stood up and tested him, saying, \"Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\"\n\nHe said to him, \"What is written in the law? How do you read it?\"\n\nHe answered, \u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself.\"\n\nHe said to him, \"You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.\"\n\nBut he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, \"Who is my neighbor?\"}}\n\nJesus replies with a story:\n{{quotation||Luke 10:30\u201337, [[World English Bible]]|text=Jesus answered, \"A certain man was going down from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Jericho]], and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side. In the same way a [[Levite]] also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain [[Samaritan]], as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on  oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two [[denarii]], gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.' Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?\"\n\nHe said, \"He who showed mercy on him.\"\nThen Jesus said to him, \"Go and do likewise.\"}}\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:OldRoadFromJerusalemToJericho.jpg|thumb|240px|The road from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Jericho]].]]\n\n===Road from Jerusalem to Jericho===\nIn the time of Jesus, the road from Jerusalem to Jericho was notorious for its danger and difficulty, and was known as the \"Way of Blood\" because \"of the blood which is often shed there by robbers\".<ref>Wilkinson, \"The Way from Jerusalem to Jericho\" The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Mar., 1975), pp. 10\u201324</ref> [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], in his \"[[I've Been to the Mountaintop]]\" speech, on the day before his death, described the road as follows:\n\n<blockquote>I remember when Mrs. King and I were first in Jerusalem. We rented a car and drove from Jerusalem down to Jericho. And as soon as we got on that road, I said to my wife, \"I can see why Jesus used this as the setting for his parable.\" It's a winding, meandering road. It's really conducive for ambushing. You start out in Jerusalem, which is about 1200 miles -- or rather 1200 feet above sea level. And by the time you get down to Jericho, fifteen or twenty minutes later, you're about 2200 feet below sea level. That's a dangerous road.<ref>Martin Luther King, Jr: \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\", delivered 3 April 1968, Memphis, Tennessee [https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkivebeentothemountaintop.htm]</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:First century Iudaea province.gif|thumb|240px|A map of [[Israel (region)|Israel]] in the time of Jesus. Jericho is just north of the [[Dead Sea]], with Jerusalem to the west.]]\n\n===Samaritans and Jesus===\nJesus' target audience, the [[Jews]], hated Samaritans<ref name=\"GregWForbes63\"/> to such a degree that they destroyed the Samaritans' temple on [[Mount Gerizim]].<ref>An event which the first-century historian Josephus records (''J.W.'' 13.9.1 \u00a7256). For a different opinion, see {{Cite journal |author=Jonathan Bourgel |title=The Destruction of the Samaritan Temple by John Hyrcanus: A Reconsideration |year=2016 |publisher=[[Society of Biblical Literature]] |journal=[[Journal of Biblical Literature]] |volume=135 |url=https://www.academia.edu/34049422 |doi=10.15699/jbl.1353.2016.3129 |issue=153/3|pages=505 }}</ref> Due to this hatred, some think that the Lawyer's phrase \"The one who had mercy on him\" ({{bibleverse|Luke|10:37|NIV}}) may indicate a reluctance to name the Samaritan.<ref hname=\"IHM\"/> Or, on another, more positive note, it may indicate that the lawyer has recognized that both his questions have been answered and now concludes by generally expressing that anyone behaving thus is a ({{bibleverse|Lev|19:18|NIV}}) \"neighbor\" eligible to inherit eternal life.<ref>See, e.g., Lane's argument that the lawyer positively alludes to Exod 34:6, with the word in 10:37a usually translated \"mercy\" ({{lang|el|\u1f14\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2}}) actually referencing Septuagintal translation of the Hebrew word \u05d7\u05e1\u05d3, \"covenantal loyalty,\" in Nathan Lane, \"An Echo of Mercy: A Rereading of the Parable of the Good Samaritan,\" in ''Early Christian Literature and Intertextuality.

The authentic gospel of Jesus. London, Penguin Books. 2004. p. 152-154.</ref>\n\nAs the story reached those who were unaware of the oppression of the Samaritans, this aspect of the parable became less and less discernible: fewer and fewer people ever heard of them in any context other than as a description. Today, the story is often recast in a more modern setting where the people are ones in equivalent social groups known not to interact comfortably. Thus, cast appropriately, the parable regains its message to modern listeners: namely, that an individual of a social group they disapprove of can exhibit moral behavior that is superior to individuals of the groups they approve. Christians have used it as an example of Christianity's opposition to racial, ethnic, and sectarian prejudice.<ref>''Karl Barth's theological exegesis'' by Richard E.

According to them, under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall; from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly extinguished in him; because he is said to be only half-dead. As if it had been the design of Christ, in this passage, to speak of the corruption of human nature, and to inquire whether the wound which Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable; nay, as if he had not plainly, and without a figure, declared in another passage, that all are dead, but those whom he quickens by his voice ({{bibleverse|John|5:25|NIV}}). As little plausibility belongs to another allegory, which, however, has been so highly satisfactory, that it has been admitted by almost universal consent, as if it had been a revelation from heaven. This Samaritan they imagine to be Christ, because he is our guardian; and they tell us that wine was poured, along with oil, into the wound, because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace. They have contrived a third subtlety, that Christ does not immediately restore health, but sends us to the Church, as an innkeeper, to be gradually cured. I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these interpretations; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning. And, indeed, any one may see that the curiosity of certain men has led them to contrive these speculations, contrary to the intention of Christ.<ref name=\"CalvinHarmony\">[[John Calvin]], ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom33.ii.vii.html Commentary on Matthew, Mark, Luke \u2013 Volume 3]''.</ref>}}\n\n[[Francis Schaeffer]] suggested: \"Christians are not to love their believing brothers to the exclusion of their non-believing fellowmen.

Hence it is inferred that there is a mutual obligation between all men.\"<ref name=\"CalvinHarmony\"/> In other writings, Calvin pointed out that people are not born merely for themselves, but rather \"mankind is knit together with a holy knot ... we must not live for ourselves, but for our neighbors.\"<ref name=\"CalvinActs\">[[John Calvin]], ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom36.xx.vii.html Commentary on Acts 13]''.</ref> Earlier, [[Cyril of Alexandria]] had written that \"a crown of love is being twined for him who loves his neighbour.\"<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/cyril_on_luke_07_sermons_66_80.htm Cyril's Sermons on Luke #68.]</ref>\n\n[[Joel B.

Some have suggested that [[religious tolerance]] was an important message of the parable. By selecting for the moral protagonist of the story someone whose religion (Samaritanism) was despised by the Jewish audience to which Jesus was speaking, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay religious differences in favor of focusing on moral character and good works.<ref>{{cite book | author=Smith, John Hunter | title=Greek Testament lessons, consisting chiefly of the Sermon on the mount, and the parables of our Lord.

By contrasting the noble acts of a despised religion to the crass and selfish acts of a priest and a Levite, two representatives of the Jewish religious establishment, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay the importance of status in the religious hierarchy (or importance of knowledge of scripture) in favor of the practice of religious principles.<ref>{{cite book | author=Andrews, Dave | title=Not Religion but Love: Practicing a Radical Spirituality of Compassion | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTxNAwAAQBAJ | publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers | year=2012 | page=117| isbn=9781610978514 }}<br />{{cite book | author=Wilson, Jared C. | title=The Storytelling God: Seeing the Glory of Jesus in His Parables | publisher=Crossway | year=2014 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2pneAgAAQBAJ | page=88| isbn=9781433536717 }}</ref>\n\n====Modern Jewish view====\n''The following is based on the public domain article [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1509&letter=B&search=great%20commandment Brotherly Love] found in the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''\n{{Further|Jewish views on love|Chesed}}\n\nThe story of the good Samaritan, in the Pauline Gospel of Luke x. 25\u201337, related to illustrate the meaning of the word \"neighbor,\" possesses a feature which puzzles the student of rabbinical lore. The kind Samaritan who comes to the rescue of the men that had fallen among the robbers, is contrasted with the unkind priest and Levite; whereas the third class of Jews\u2014i.e., the ordinary Israelites who, as a rule, follow the Cohen and the Levite are omitted; and therefore suspicion is aroused regarding the original form of the story. If \"Samaritan\" has been substituted by the anti-Judean gospel-writer for the original \"Israelite,\" no reflection was intended by Jesus upon Jewish teaching concerning the meaning of neighbor; and the lesson implied is that he who is in need must be the object of our love.\n\nThe term \"neighbor\" has not at all times been thus understood by Jewish teachers.<ref>Several recognize that Lev 19:18  exclusively refers to the Israelitish neighbor (e.g., Stade, \"Gesch. des Volkes Israel,\" i. 510a). This debate is reflected in the question by the Jewish Torah expert re the definition of \"neighbor\" in Lev 19:18 (Luke 10:29).</ref> In Tanna debe Eliyahu R. xv. it is said: \"Blessed be the Lord who is impartial toward all. He says: 'Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor. Thy neighbor is like thy brother, and thy brother is like thy neighbor.'\" Likewise in xxviii.: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\"; that is, thou shalt make the name of God beloved to the creatures by a righteous conduct toward Gentiles as well as Jews (compare Sifre, Deut. 32). Aaron b. Abraham ibn \u1e24ayyim of the sixteenth century, in his commentary to Sifre, l.c.; \u1e24ayyim Vital, the cabalist, in his \"Sha'are \u1e32edushah,\" i. 5; and Moses \u1e24agis of the eighteenth century, in his work on the 613 commandments, while commenting on Deut. xxiii. 7, teach alike that the law of love of the neighbor includes the non-Israelite as well as the Israelite. There is nowhere a dissenting opinion expressed by Jewish writers. For modern times, see among others the conservative opinion of Plessner's religious catechism, \"Dat Mosheh we-Yehudit,\" p.&nbsp;258.\n\nAccordingly, the synod at [[Leipzig]] in 1869, and the German-Israelitish Union of Congregations in 1885, stood on old historical ground when declaring (Lazarus, \"Ethics of Judaism,\" i. 234, 302) that \"'Love thy neighbor as thyself' is a command of all-embracing love, and is a fundamental principle of the Jewish religion\"; and Stade, when charging with imposture the rabbis who made this declaration, is entirely in error (see his \"Geschichte des Volkes Israel,\" l.c.).\n\n=={{anchor|Historical reliability}} Authenticity==\n[[File:Aime-Morot-Le-bon-Samaritain.JPG|thumb|200px|''The Good Samaritan'' by [[Aim\u00e9 Morot]] (1880) shows the Good Samaritan taking the injured man to the inn.]]\n\nThe [[Jesus Seminar]] voted this parable to be authentic,<ref name = \"5GLuke\">[[Robert W.

Do this, and you will live.\"\n\nBut he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, \"Who is my neighbor?\"}}\n\nJesus replies with a story:\n{{quotation||Luke 10:30\u201337, [[World English Bible]]|text=Jesus answered, \"A certain man was going down from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Jericho]], and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side. In the same way a [[Levite]] also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain [[Samaritan]], as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on  oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two [[denarii]], gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.' Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?\"\n\nHe said, \"He who showed mercy on him.\"\nThen Jesus said to him, \"Go and do likewise.\"}}\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:OldRoadFromJerusalemToJericho.jpg|thumb|240px|The road from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Jericho]].]]\n\n===Road from Jerusalem to Jericho===\nIn the time of Jesus, the road from Jerusalem to Jericho was notorious for its danger and difficulty, and was known as the \"Way of Blood\" because \"of the blood which is often shed there by robbers\".<ref>Wilkinson, \"The Way from Jerusalem to Jericho\" The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Mar., 1975), pp. 10\u201324</ref> [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], in his \"[[I've Been to the Mountaintop]]\" speech, on the day before his death, described the road as follows:\n\n<blockquote>I remember when Mrs. King and I were first in Jerusalem. We rented a car and drove from Jerusalem down to Jericho. And as soon as we got on that road, I said to my wife, \"I can see why Jesus used this as the setting for his parable.\" It's a winding, meandering road. It's really conducive for ambushing. You start out in Jerusalem, which is about 1200 miles -- or rather 1200 feet above sea level. And by the time you get down to Jericho, fifteen or twenty minutes later, you're about 2200 feet below sea level.

Today, the story is often recast in a more modern setting where the people are ones in equivalent social groups known not to interact comfortably. Thus, cast appropriately, the parable regains its message to modern listeners: namely, that an individual of a social group they disapprove of can exhibit moral behavior that is superior to individuals of the groups they approve. Christians have used it as an example of Christianity's opposition to racial, ethnic, and sectarian prejudice.<ref>''Karl Barth's theological exegesis'' by Richard E.

According to them, under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall; from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly extinguished in him; because he is said to be only half-dead. As if it had been the design of Christ, in this passage, to speak of the corruption of human nature, and to inquire whether the wound which Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable; nay, as if he had not plainly, and without a figure, declared in another passage, that all are dead, but those whom he quickens by his voice ({{bibleverse|John|5:25|NIV}}). As little plausibility belongs to another allegory, which, however, has been so highly satisfactory, that it has been admitted by almost universal consent, as if it had been a revelation from heaven. This Samaritan they imagine to be Christ, because he is our guardian; and they tell us that wine was poured, along with oil, into the wound, because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace. They have contrived a third subtlety, that Christ does not immediately restore health, but sends us to the Church, as an innkeeper, to be gradually cured. I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these interpretations; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning.

Some have suggested that [[religious tolerance]] was an important message of the parable. By selecting for the moral protagonist of the story someone whose religion (Samaritanism) was despised by the Jewish audience to which Jesus was speaking, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay religious differences in favor of focusing on moral character and good works.<ref>{{cite book | author=Smith, John Hunter | title=Greek Testament lessons, consisting chiefly of the Sermon on the mount, and the parables of our Lord.

The kind Samaritan who comes to the rescue of the men that had fallen among the robbers, is contrasted with the unkind priest and Levite; whereas the third class of Jews\u2014i.e., the ordinary Israelites who, as a rule, follow the Cohen and the Levite are omitted; and therefore suspicion is aroused regarding the original form of the story. If \"Samaritan\" has been substituted by the anti-Judean gospel-writer for the original \"Israelite,\" no reflection was intended by Jesus upon Jewish teaching concerning the meaning of neighbor; and the lesson implied is that he who is in need must be the object of our love.\n\nThe term \"neighbor\" has not at all times been thus understood by Jewish teachers.<ref>Several recognize that Lev 19:18  exclusively refers to the Israelitish neighbor (e.g., Stade, \"Gesch. des Volkes Israel,\" i. 510a). This debate is reflected in the question by the Jewish Torah expert re the definition of \"neighbor\" in Lev 19:18 (Luke 10:29).</ref> In Tanna debe Eliyahu R. xv. it is said: \"Blessed be the Lord who is impartial toward all. He says: 'Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor. Thy neighbor is like thy brother, and thy brother is like thy neighbor.'\" Likewise in xxviii.: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\"; that is, thou shalt make the name of God beloved to the creatures by a righteous conduct toward Gentiles as well as Jews (compare Sifre, Deut. 32). Aaron b. Abraham ibn \u1e24ayyim of the sixteenth century, in his commentary to Sifre, l.c.; \u1e24ayyim Vital, the cabalist, in his \"Sha'are \u1e32edushah,\" i. 5; and Moses \u1e24agis of the eighteenth century, in his work on the 613 commandments, while commenting on Deut. xxiii. 7, teach alike that the law of love of the neighbor includes the non-Israelite as well as the Israelite. There is nowhere a dissenting opinion expressed by Jewish writers. For modern times, see among others the conservative opinion of Plessner's religious catechism, \"Dat Mosheh we-Yehudit,\" p.&nbsp;258.\n\nAccordingly, the synod at [[Leipzig]] in 1869, and the German-Israelitish Union of Congregations in 1885, stood on old historical ground when declaring (Lazarus, \"Ethics of Judaism,\" i. 234, 302) that \"'Love thy neighbor as thyself' is a command of all-embracing love, and is a fundamental principle of the Jewish religion\"; and Stade, when charging with imposture the rabbis who made this declaration, is entirely in error (see his \"Geschichte des Volkes Israel,\" l.c.).\n\n=={{anchor|Historical reliability}} Authenticity==\n[[File:Aime-Morot-Le-bon-Samaritain.JPG|thumb|200px|''The Good Samaritan'' by [[Aim\u00e9 Morot]] (1880) shows the Good Samaritan taking the injured man to the inn.]]\n\nThe [[Jesus Seminar]] voted this parable to be authentic,<ref name = \"5GLuke\">[[Robert W.
