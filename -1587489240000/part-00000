{"title_page": "GNC Grip Gauntlet", "text_new": "[[Image:GNC Grip Gauntlet.jpg|200px|right]]\nThe '''GNC Grip Gauntlet''' (officially the ''GNC Pro Performance Grip Gauntlet'') is a [[strength athletics]] contest that tests the grip strength of competing individuals over three disciplines, each designed to test one of the three recognised facets of hand strength: crushing; pinching; and supporting. It was developed by Wade and Brad Gillingham and became an internationally recognised contest featured at some of the world's most prominent strength athletics events and expos, including the [[Arnold Strongman Classic]] and the various [[WSM Super Series]] Grand Prixs.  The last time the GNC Grip Gauntlet was run in a competitive format was the 2010 Arnold Classic.  Since that time the challenge has changed to an informal challenge with no official results maintained.  Prizes are still awarded for successful completion of the challenge.\n\n==History==\nIn 2002 Wade and Brad Gillingham (GNC Pro Performance Sponsored Athletes) and General Nutrition Center (GNC) introduced The Blob Challenge in the GNC booth at the Mr. Olympia in Las Vegas, NV.  The Blob Challenge was run in the GNC booth at 4 events from 2002 - 2003.  Late in 2003 Wade and Brad Gillingham wanting to expand the challenge came up with the idea to test 3 main facets of grip strength: Crushing Strength, Pinching Strength, and Supporting Strength.  Upon approval from GNC to expand the challenge Wade approached Randall Strossen from IronMind to get permission to use Captains of Crush grippers as part of the challenge.  In conversation with Randall it was decided that Wade and Brad's original idea to use a Thomas Inch Dumbbell replica for the supporting grip challenge should be replaced with the IronMind Rolling Thunder.  The ''GNC Pro Performance Grip Gauntlet'' debuted at the 2004 [[Arnold Strongman Classic|Arnold Expo Challenge]]. The three implements used were the No. 3 Captains of Crush gripper, the Rolling Thunder, and an implement called the Blob. Cash prizes were available for succeeding with all three elements of the challenge.<ref name=\"IronMindHistory\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.captainsofcrushgrippers.com/ironmind/opencms/grippers/griphighlights.html |title=IronMind History |access-date=2008-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213151004/http://captainsofcrushgrippers.com/ironmind/opencms/grippers/griphighlights.html |archive-date=2009-02-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  An estimated 20,000 competitors at Fitness Expos over a 7 year run from 2004-2010 tested their hands at the GNC Grip Gauntlet.\n\nAs to the stature of the Gauntlet, Gillingham is quoted as saying in 2008: ''\"If you think this challenge isn't world class, think again. Over the past four years, an estimated 10,000 attempts have been made to complete the three challenges on the GNC Grip Gauntlet stage and only two individuals have ever completed all three in the \u2018heavy\u2019 format.\"<ref>The two men to whom Gillingham was referring were former [[NFL]] linebacker and professional wrestler, Monte \u2018Alpha Male\u2019 Brown, and Wade Gillingham himself.</ref>\n\nThe Gauntlet eventually settled on three formats, Light, Medium and Heavy. In early 2009, the weight of the Rolling Thunder was dropped from 212&nbsp;lbs to 207&nbsp;lbs, to correspond with Ironmind's new version of the Rolling Thunder.<ref>[http://www.jackalsgym.com/blog.aspx?user_id=1&blog_id=96 Wade Gillingham's Arnold Classic Recap]</ref>  In 2010 due to changes in the Rolling Thunder and a change from Captain's of Crush grippers to the new GNC Pro Performance Hand Grippers, it was decided by Wade Gillingham that the historical integrity of the event was not longer sound enough to continue compiling a list of winners.\n\n==Disciplines==\nThe disciplines of crushing, pinching and supporting are tested. Crushing, uses the IronMind Captains of Crush grippers. Supporting is tested using IronMind Rolling Thunder. Pinching (or pinch gripping) uses the Blob.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Implement\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Light Format\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Medium Format\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Heavy Format\n|-\n|Rolling Thunder || 187&nbsp;lbs || 197&nbsp;lbs || 207&nbsp;lbs\n|-\n|Blob || 50&nbsp;lbs || 50&nbsp;lbs || 50&nbsp;lbs\n|-\n|Crush Grippers || #2 || #2.5 || #3\n|}\n\n==Rolling Thunder==\nAlthough often referred as a part of the GNC Grip Gauntlet, the Rolling Thunder's history goes back more than a decade before the Gauntlet first existed. IronMind developed the Rolling Thunder in 1993 and it is now known by strong men worldwide. One-hand deadlifts had long been a preferred means of testing and building grip strength and Rolling Thunder itself is a thick revolving deadlift handle to which can be attached weights. Such is the rise of its popularity that Rolling Thunder competitions are often held in conjunction with major strongman events including the [[Strongman Super Series#2008|Mohegan Sun Grand Prix 2008]] and the Hawaii based [[Beauty and the Beast Strongman Contest]]s. As part of the GNC Grip Gauntlet it is also seen around the world at expos. Early on in its history, in 1993, Ironmind issued a challenge to the world of strongmen to lift 300&nbsp;lbs with Rolling Thunder, and it took 15 years for this challenge to be met when [[Mark Felix]] performed the feat at the [[Strongman Super Series#2008|Mohegan Sun Grand Prix 2008]], in the process becoming Rolling Thunder World Champion.

It was developed by Wade and Brad Gillingham and became an internationally recognised contest featured at some of the world's most prominent strength athletics events and expos, including the [[Arnold Strongman Classic]] and the various [[WSM Super Series]] Grand Prixs.  The last time the GNC Grip Gauntlet was run in a competitive format was the 2010 Arnold Classic.  Since that time the challenge has changed to an informal challenge with no official results maintained.  Prizes are still awarded for successful completion of the challenge.\n\n==History==\nIn 2002 Wade and Brad Gillingham (GNC Pro Performance Sponsored Athletes) and General Nutrition Center (GNC) introduced The Blob Challenge in the GNC booth at the Mr. Olympia in Las Vegas, NV.  The Blob Challenge was run in the GNC booth at 4 events from 2002 - 2003.  Late in 2003 Wade and Brad Gillingham wanting to expand the challenge came up with the idea to test 3 main facets of grip strength: Crushing Strength, Pinching Strength, and Supporting Strength.  Upon approval from GNC to expand the challenge Wade approached Randall Strossen from IronMind to get permission to use Captains of Crush grippers as part of the challenge.  In conversation with Randall it was decided that Wade and Brad's original idea to use a Thomas Inch Dumbbell replica for the supporting grip challenge should be replaced with the IronMind Rolling Thunder.  The ''GNC Pro Performance Grip Gauntlet'' debuted at the 2004 [[Arnold Strongman Classic|Arnold Expo Challenge]]. The three implements used were the No. 3 Captains of Crush gripper, the Rolling Thunder, and an implement called the Blob. Cash prizes were available for succeeding with all three elements of the challenge.<ref name=\"IronMindHistory\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.captainsofcrushgrippers.com/ironmind/opencms/grippers/griphighlights.html |title=IronMind History |access-date=2008-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213151004/http://captainsofcrushgrippers.com/ironmind/opencms/grippers/griphighlights.html |archive-date=2009-02-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  An estimated 20,000 competitors at Fitness Expos over a 7 year run from 2004-2010 tested their hands at the GNC Grip Gauntlet.\n\nAs to the stature of the Gauntlet, Gillingham is quoted as saying in 2008: ''\"If you think this challenge isn't world class, think again. Over the past four years, an estimated 10,000 attempts have been made to complete the three challenges on the GNC Grip Gauntlet stage and only two individuals have ever completed all three in the \u2018heavy\u2019 format.\"<ref>The two men to whom Gillingham was referring were former [[NFL]] linebacker and professional wrestler, Monte \u2018Alpha Male\u2019 Brown, and Wade Gillingham himself.</ref>\n\nThe Gauntlet eventually settled on three formats, Light, Medium and Heavy. In early 2009, the weight of the Rolling Thunder was dropped from 212&nbsp;lbs to 207&nbsp;lbs, to correspond with Ironmind's new version of the Rolling Thunder.<ref>[http://www.jackalsgym.com/blog.aspx?user_id=1&blog_id=96 Wade Gillingham's Arnold Classic Recap]</ref>  In 2010 due to changes in the Rolling Thunder and a change from Captain's of Crush grippers to the new GNC Pro Performance Hand Grippers, it was decided by Wade Gillingham that the historical integrity of the event was not longer sound enough to continue compiling a list of winners.\n\n==Disciplines==\nThe disciplines of crushing, pinching and supporting are tested. Crushing, uses the IronMind Captains of Crush grippers. Supporting is tested using IronMind Rolling Thunder. Pinching (or pinch gripping) uses the Blob.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Implement\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Light Format\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Medium Format\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Heavy Format\n|-\n|Rolling Thunder || 187&nbsp;lbs || 197&nbsp;lbs || 207&nbsp;lbs\n|-\n|Blob || 50&nbsp;lbs || 50&nbsp;lbs || 50&nbsp;lbs\n|-\n|Crush Grippers || #2 || #2.5 || #3\n|}\n\n==Rolling Thunder==\nAlthough often referred as a part of the GNC Grip Gauntlet, the Rolling Thunder's history goes back more than a decade before the Gauntlet first existed. IronMind developed the Rolling Thunder in 1993 and it is now known by strong men worldwide. One-hand deadlifts had long been a preferred means of testing and building grip strength and Rolling Thunder itself is a thick revolving deadlift handle to which can be attached weights. Such is the rise of its popularity that Rolling Thunder competitions are often held in conjunction with major strongman events including the [[Strongman Super Series#2008|Mohegun Sun Grand Prix 2008]] and the Hawaii based [[Beauty and the Beast Strongman Contest]]s. As part of the GNC Grip Gauntlet it is also seen around the world at expos. Early on in its history, in 1993, Ironmind issued a challenge to the world of strongmen to lift 300&nbsp;lbs with Rolling Thunder, and it took 15 years for this challenge to be met when [[Mark Felix]] performed the feat at the [[Strongman Super Series#2008|Mohegan Sun Grand Prix 2008]], in the process becoming Rolling Thunder World Champion. In May 2009 Felix defended his Mohegan Sun title, although this was not considered the world championships.<ref>[http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/2009/May/Mark_Felix_Wins_Mohegan_Sun_Rolling_Thunderx_Championships_II.html Mark Felix Wins Mohegan Sun Rolling_Thunder Championships II]</ref> He defended the world title in June 2009 in Quebec as a lead-in event to the [[Fortissimus]] championships.\n\nMark Felix set a new [[Rolling Thunder (Strongman)|Rolling Thunder]] world record on May 22, 2012 at the Bodypower Expo in [[Birmingham, England]] with a lift of {{convert|332|lb|kg}}, more than 30 lbs. heavier than his previous world record of {{convert|301|lb|kg}}.<ref>http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/2012/May/Mark_Felix_Demolishes_Rolling_Thunder_World_Record.html</ref>\n\n\n\n===Men's World Record===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Date\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Champion\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Weight\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Location\n|-\n|'''2012 (May 22)''' || {{flagicon|GBR}} [[Mark Felix]] || 332&nbsp;lb ||{{flagicon|England}}<small>2012 Bodypower Expo, [[Birmingham]]</small><ref>http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/2012/May/Mark_Felix_Demolishes_Rolling_Thunder_World_Record.html</ref>\n|-\n|'''2008 (January 18)''' || {{flagicon|GBR}} [[Mark Felix]] || 301&nbsp;lb ||{{flagicon|USA}} <small>[[Strongman Super Series#2008|Mohegan Sun Grand Prix 2008]]<sup>[[#Notes|Note 1 WCh]]</sup></small>\n|-\n|'''2006 (August 1)''' || {{flagicon|GBR}} [[Laine Snook]] || 274.2&nbsp;lb ||{{flagicon|England}}<small>Pullum Sports, [[Luton]]</small><ref>[http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/2006/Aug/Laine_Snook_Breaks_Rolling_Thunder_World_Record.html Tuesday, August 1, 2006, ''Laine Snook Breaks Rolling Thunder World Record'', by Randall J.
