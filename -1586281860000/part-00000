Additionally, Elkj\u00e6r scored nearly 40 goals for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]] in 11 years, being a leading figure for the Danish side under coach [[Sepp Piontek]] that played at the [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro 1984]] and the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] (a first-ever appearance), often hailed as the golden generation of [[Danish football]] by their countrymen. Elkj\u00e6r won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Bronze Ball]] award at the latter competition.  \n \nWidely regarded as one of the best forwards of the 1980s, Elkj\u00e6r finished second in the [[Ballon d'Or]] awards in 1985, having been placed third the previous year, and going on to finish fourth in [[1986 Ballon d'Or|1986]]. In [[Verona]] he is still remembered fondly, having earned the persisting nickname \"Il sindaco\" (the mayor) during his stint for the club. To this day, at least a few hundred voters in the city continue to write his name on their ballots at the mayoral elections.

Additionally, Elkj\u00e6r scored nearly 40 goals for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]] in 11 years, being a leading figure for the Danish side under coach [[Sepp Piontek]] that played at the [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro 1984]] and the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] (a first-ever appearance), often hailed as the golden generation of [[Danish football]] by their countrymen. Elkj\u00e6r won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Bronze Ball]] award at the latter competition.  \n \nWidely regarded as one of the best forwards of the 1980s, Elkj\u00e6r finished second in the [[Ballon d'Or]] awards in 1985, having been placed third the previous year, and going on to finish fourth in [[1986 Ballon d'Or|1986]].

This configuration was subsequently used into the 1980s in the [[Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate|''Oliver Hazard Perry'' class]] frigates, and [[Ticonderoga class cruiser|''Ticonderoga'' class]] cruisers.

This container is very near the size of a standard {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} [[Containerization|intermodal shipping container]] - but not the same, the engine size very slightly exceeds those dimensions. The air intake ducting may be designed and shaped appropriately for easy removal of the LM2500 from their ships.\n\nThe LM2500+ is an evolution of the LM2500, delivering up to {{convert|40200|shp|kW|abbr=on}} or 28.6 MW of electric energy when combined with an [[electrical generator]]. Two of such turbo-generators have been installed in the superstructure near the [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] of ''[[Queen Mary 2]]'', the world's largest transatlantic ocean liner, for additional electric energy when the ship's four diesel-generators are working at maximum capacity or fail.<!-- no, this is not CODAG -->  [[Celebrity Cruises]] uses two LM2500+ engines in their ''[[Millennium

This container is very near the size of a standard {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} [[Containerization|intermodal shipping container]] - but not the same, the engine size very slightly exceeds those dimensions. The air intake ducting may be designed and shaped appropriately for easy removal of the LM2500 from their ships.\n\nThe LM2500+ is an evolution of the LM2500, delivering up to {{convert|40200|shp|kW|abbr=on}} or 28.6 MW of electric energy when combined with an [[electrical generator]]. Two of such turbo-generators have been installed in the superstructure near the [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] of ''[[Queen Mary 2]]'', the world's largest transatlantic ocean liner, for additional electric energy when the ship's four diesel-generators are working at maximum capacity or fail.<!-- no, this is not CODAG -->  [[Celebrity Cruises]] uses two LM2500+ engines in their ''[[Millennium (ship)|Millennium]]''-class ships in a [[COGAS]] cycle.\n\nThe LM2500 is license-built in Japan by [[IHI Corporation]],{{cn|date=May 2019}} in India by [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]],<ref>[https://www.gemarinesolutions.com/markets/military GE Marine Solutions Military page]</ref> and in Italy by [[Avio Aero]].{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe LM2500/LM2500+ can often be found as turbine part of [[combined diesel and gas|CODAG,]] [[combined diesel or gas|CODOG]], [[Combined diesel-electric and gas|CODLAG]] propulsion systems or in pairs as powerplants for [[COGAG]] systems.\n\n==Applications==\n''[[Aircraft carrier]]:''\n* {{Ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Cavour|C 550}} ([[Italian Navy]])\n* {{Ship|HTMS|Chakri Naruebet}} ([[Royal Thai Navy]])\n* {{Ship|Spanish

In Julia, all concrete types are [[subtyping|subtypes]] of abstract types, directly or indirectly subtypes of the ''Any'' type, which is the top of the type hierarchy. Concrete types can not themselves be subtyped the way they can in other languages; composition is used instead (see also [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)#Inheritance vs subtyping|inheritance vs subtyping]]).\n\nJulia draws significant inspiration from various dialects of Lisp<!-- Karpinski: \"In short, I would describe it as a Lisp with Matlab-like syntax\" https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/pv3k9/why_we_created_julia_a_new_programming_language/ -->, including [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Common Lisp]], and it shares many features with [[Dylan (programming language)|Dylan]], also a multiple-dispatch-oriented dynamic language (which features an [[ALGOL]]-like [[Free-form language|free-form]] [[Infix notation|infix]] syntax rather than a Lisp-like prefix syntax, while in Julia \"everything\"<ref name=\"Learn Julia in Y\">{{cite web|url=https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/ |title=Learn Julia in Y Minutes |website=Learnxinyminutes.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-31}}</ref> is an [[Expression (computer science)|expression]]), and with [[Fortress (programming language)|Fortress]], another numerical programming language (which features multiple dispatch and a sophisticated parametric type system). While [[Common Lisp Object System]] (CLOS) adds multiple dispatch to Common Lisp, not all functions are generic functions.\n\nIn Julia, Dylan, and Fortress extensibility is the default, and the system's built-in functions are all generic and extensible. In Dylan, multiple dispatch is as fundamental as it is in Julia: all user-defined functions and even basic built-in operations like <code>+</code> are generic. Dylan's type system, however, does not fully support parametric types, which are more typical of the [[Generational list of programming languages#ML based|ML lineage of languages]]. By default, CLOS does not allow for dispatch on Common Lisp's parametric types; such extended dispatch semantics can only be added as an extension through the [[Common Lisp Object System#Metaobject Protocol|CLOS Metaobject Protocol]]. By convergent design, Fortress also features multiple dispatch on parametric types; unlike Julia, however, Fortress is statically rather than dynamically typed, with separate compiling and executing phases. The language features are summarized in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! [[Programming language|Language]] !! [[Type system]] !! [[Generic function]]s !!

While [[Common Lisp Object System]] (CLOS) adds multiple dispatch to Common Lisp, not all functions are generic functions.\n\nIn Julia, Dylan, and Fortress extensibility is the default, and the system's built-in functions are all generic and extensible. In Dylan, multiple dispatch is as fundamental as it is in Julia: all user-defined functions and even basic built-in operations like <code>+</code> are generic. Dylan's type system, however, does not fully support parametric types, which are more typical of the [[Generational list of programming languages#ML based|ML lineage of languages]]. By default, CLOS does not allow for dispatch on Common Lisp's parametric types; such extended dispatch semantics can only be added as an extension through the [[Common Lisp Object System#Metaobject Protocol|CLOS Metaobject Protocol]]. By convergent design, Fortress also features multiple dispatch on parametric types; unlike Julia, however, Fortress is statically rather than dynamically typed, with separate compiling and executing phases. The language features are summarized in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! [[Programming language|Language]] !! [[Type system]] !! [[Generic function]]s !!

Based on this treaty and on early claims by Spanish explorer [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]], discoverer of the [[Pacific Ocean]] in 1513, the Spanish conquered large territories in North, Central and South America.\n\nAround the late 1490s, cartographer [[Amerigo Vespucci|Americo Vespuscio]] explored the American eastern coast, on behalf of both the Portuguese and Spanish crowns, and published in 1502\u20131503, his new book ''Mundus Novus'' (''New World''), which disproved the belief that the Americas were the easternmost part of Asia and, in actuallity, an entire new world.\n\n[[File:Non-Native-American-Nations-Territorial-Claims-over-NAFTA-countries-1750-2008.gif|thumb|Territorial evolution of North America of non-native nation states from 1750 to 2008]]\n[[File:Political Evolution of Central America and the Caribbean 1700 and on.gif|thumb|Central America and Caribbean sovereignty 1700\u2013present]]\n\nSpanish conquistador [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] took over the [[Aztec Empire|Aztec Kingdom]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]] conquered the [[Inca Empire]]. As a result, by the mid-16th century, the Spanish Crown had gained control of much of western South America, and southern [[North America]], in addition to its earlier [[Caribbean]] territories. Over this same timeframe, [[History of Portugal|Portugal]] claimed lands in North America (Canada) and colonized much of eastern South America, naming it [[History of Brazil|Santa Cruz and Brazil]].\n\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\nOther [[Europe]]an nations soon disputed the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas. England and [[Ancien R\u00e9gime in France|France]] attempted to plant colonies in the Americas in the 16th century, but these failed. England and France succeeded in establishing permanent colonies in the following century, along with the [[Dutch Republic]]. Some of these were on Caribbean islands, which had often already been conquered by the Spanish or depopulated by disease, while others were in eastern North America, which had not been colonized by Spain north of [[History of Florida|Florida]].\n\nEarly European possessions in North America included [[Spanish Florida]], [[Spanish New Mexico]], the English colonies of [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] (with its [[List of islands in the Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] offshoot, [[Bermuda]]) and [[New England Colonies|New England]], the French colonies of [[Acadia]] and [[Canada, New France|Canada]], the Swedish colony of [[New Sweden]], and the Dutch [[New Netherland]]. In the 18th century, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] revived its former colonies in [[Greenland]], while the [[Russian Empire]] gained a foothold in [[Russian America|Alaska]]. Denmark-Norway would later make several claims in the Caribbean, starting in the 1600s.\n\nAs more nations gained an interest in the colonization of the Americas, competition for territory became increasingly fierce. Colonists often faced the threat of attacks from neighboring colonies, as well as from indigenous tribes and [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirates]].\n\n==Early state-sponsored colonists==\n[[File:RUIDIAZ(1893) 1.083 JUAN PONCE DE LE\u00d3N.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] ([[Santerv\u00e1s de Campos]], [[Province of Valladolid|Valladolid]], [[Spain]])]]\n{{Further|Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Spanish colonization of the Americas|First European colonization wave (15th century\u201319th century)}}\nThe first phase of well-financed European activity in the Americas began with the Atlantic Ocean crossings of Christopher Columbus (1492\u20131504), sponsored by Spain, whose original attempt was to find a new route to India and China, known as \"[[Indies|the Indies]]\". He was followed by other explorers such as [[John Cabot]], who was sponsored by England and reached Newfoundland. [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] reached Brazil and claimed it for Portugal.\n\n[[Amerigo Vespucci]], working for Portugal in voyages from 1497 to 1513, established that Columbus had reached a new set of continents. [[Cartography|Cartographers]] still use a [[Latinization (literature)|Latinized]] version of his first name, ''America'', for the two continents. Other explorers included [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], sponsored by France in 1524; the Portuguese [[Jo\u00e3o Vaz Corte-Real]] in Newfoundland; [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]], [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real]] and [[Jo\u00e3o \u00c1lvares Fagundes]], in Newfoundland, Greenland, Labrador, and Nova Scotia (from 1498 to 1502, and in 1520); [[Jacques Cartier]] (1491\u20131557), [[Henry Hudson]] (1560s\u20131611), and [[Samuel de Champlain]] (1567\u20131635), who explored the region of Canada he reestablished as [[New France]].\n\nIn 1513, [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and led the first European expedition to see the Pacific Ocean from the [[History of the west coast of North America|west coast of the New World]]. In an action with enduring historical import, Balboa claimed the Pacific Ocean and all the lands adjoining it for the Spanish Crown. It was 1517 before another expedition, from [[Cuba]], visited Central America, [[Spanish colonization of the Yucat\u00e1n|landing on the coast of Yucat\u00e1n]] [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|in search of slaves]].\n\n[[File:Iberian Union Empires2.png|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese colonies]]\nThese explorations were followed, notably in the case of Spain, by a phase of conquest: The Spaniards, having just finished the ''[[Reconquista]]'' of Spain from Muslim rule, were the first to colonize the Americas, applying the same model of governing their European holdings to their territories of the [[New World]].\n\nTen years after Columbus's discovery, the administration of [[Hispaniola]] was given to [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando]] of the [[Order of Alc\u00e1ntara]], founded during the ''Reconquista''. As in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[Ta\u00edno people|inhabitants of Hispaniola]] were given new landmasters, while [[Roman Catholic religious order|religious orders]] handled the local administration. Progressively the ''[[encomienda]]'' system, which granted tribute (access to indigenous labor and taxation) to European settlers, was set in place.\n\nA relatively common misconception is that a small number of ''[[conquistadores]]'' conquered vast territories, aided only by disease epidemics and their powerful [[knight|caballeros]]. In fact, recent archaeological excavations have suggested a vast Spanish-Indian alliance numbering in the hundreds of thousands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferturperu.info/discovery-the-inca-rebellion-of-1536/ |title=1536 Inca Rebellion unearthed &#124; Peruvian Travel Trends |publisher=Ferturperu.info |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] eventually [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|conquered Mexico]] with the help of [[Tlaxcala]] in 1519\u20131521, while the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]] was supported by some 40,000 Incan renegades led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] in between 1532 and 1535.\n\nOver the first century and a half after Columbus's voyages, the native population of the Americas plummeted by an estimated 80% (from around 50 million in 1492 to eight million in 1650),<ref name=Histoire/> mostly by outbreaks of [[Old World]] [[Infectious diseases|diseases]].\n\nIn 1532, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] sent a vice-king to Mexico, [[Antonio de Mendoza]], in order to prevent Cortes' independentist drives, who definitively returned to Spain in 1540. Two years later, Charles V signed the [[New Laws]] (which replaced the [[Laws of Burgos]] of 1512) prohibiting slavery and the ''[[repartimientos]]'', but also claiming as his own all the lands of the Americas and all of the indigenous people as his own subjects.\n\n[[File:Cabrera Pintura de Castas.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting depicting a [[Castas]] with his mixed-race daughter and his [[Mulatta]] wife by [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], 1763]]\nWhen Pope [[Alexander VI]] issued the ''[[Inter caetera]]'' bull in May 1493 granting the new lands to the [[Kingdom of Spain]], he requested in exchange an [[Roman Catholic Church and colonialism|evangelization of the people]]. Thus, during [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s second voyage, [[Benedictine]] monks accompanied him, along with twelve other priests. As [[Slavery in medieval Europe|slavery]] was prohibited between Christians, and could only be imposed in non-Christian prisoners of war or on men already sold as slaves, the debate on Christianization was particularly acute during the 16th century. In 1537, the papal bull ''[[Sublimis Deus]]'' definitively recognized that Native Americans possessed souls, thus prohibiting their enslavement, without putting an end to the debate. Some claimed that a native who had rebelled and then been captured could be enslaved nonetheless.\n\nLater, the [[Valladolid debate]] between the Dominican priest [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]] and another Dominican [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Juan Gin\u00e9s de Sep\u00falveda]] was held, with the former arguing that Native Americans were beings doted{{clarify|date=October 2018|reason=explanation of word \"doted\" for which clarification requested}} with souls, as all other human beings, while the latter argued to the contrary and justified their enslavement.\n\nThe process of Christianization was at first violent: when the first [[Franciscan]]s arrived in Mexico in 1524, they burned the places dedicated to pagan cult, alienating much of the local population.<ref name=Histoire2/> In the 1530s, they began to adapt Christian practices to local customs, including the building of new churches on the sites of ancient places of worship, leading to a mix of Old World Christianity with local religions.<ref name=Histoire2>\"Espagnols-Indiens: le choc des civilisations\", in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n\u00b0322, July\u2013August 2007, pp. 14\u201321 (interview with Christian Duverger, teacher at the [[EHESS]])</ref> The [[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Spanish Roman Catholic Church]], needing the natives' labor and cooperation, evangelized in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] and other Native American languages, contributing to the expansion of these [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]] and equipping some of them with writing systems. One of the first primitive schools for Native Americans was founded by Fray [[Pedro de Gante]] in 1523.\n\nTo reward their troops, the ''Conquistadores'' often allotted Indian towns to their troops and officers. Black African slaves were introduced to substitute for Native American labor in some locations\u2014including the [[West Indies]], where the indigenous population was nearing extinction on many islands.\n\nDuring this time, the Portuguese gradually switched from an initial plan of establishing trading posts to extensive [[colonization]] of what is now Brazil. They imported millions of slaves to run their plantations. The Portuguese and Spanish royal governments expected to rule these settlements and collect at least 20% of all treasure found (the ''[[quinto real]]'' collected by the ''[[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]]''), in addition to collecting all the taxes they could. By the late 16th century [[silver]] from the Americas accounted for one-fifth of Spain's total budget.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Spain|work = MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/spain.html  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028035130/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/Spain.html |archivedate=2009-10-28 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> In the 16th century perhaps 240,000 Europeans entered ports in the Americas.<ref>[http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART \"The Columbian Mosaic in Colonial America\" by James Axtell] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317092614/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART |date=March 17, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/67/908.html |title=The Spanish Colonial System, 1550\u20131800.

They were sponsored by [[common stock]] companies such as the chartered [[London Company|Virginia Company]] financed by wealthy Englishmen who exaggerated the economic potential of this new land. The main purpose of this colony was the hope of finding gold.<ref name=\"Taylor 2001\"/>\n\nIt took strong leaders, like [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]], to convince the colonists of Jamestown that searching for gold was not taking care of their immediate needs for food and shelter and the [[Bible|biblical]] principle that \"he who will not work shall not eat\" (see [[2 Thessalonians 3]]). The lack of [[food security]] leading to extremely high mortality rate was quite distressing and cause for despair among the colonists. To support the Colony, numerous [[Jamestown supply missions|supply missions]] were organized. [[Tobacco]] later became a cash crop, with the work of [[John Rolfe]] and others, for export and the sustaining economic driver of [[Virginia]] and the neighboring colony of [[Maryland]].\n\nFrom the beginning of Virginia's settlements in 1587 until the 1680s, the main source of labor and a large portion of the immigrants were [[indentured servants]] looking for new life in the overseas colonies. During the 17th century, indentured servants constituted three-quarters of all European immigrants to the Chesapeake region. Most of the indentured servants were teenagers from England with poor economic prospects at home. Their fathers signed the papers that gave them free passage to America and an unpaid job until they became of age. They were given food, clothing, housing and taught farming or household skills. American landowners were in need of laborers and were willing to pay for a laborer's passage to America if they served them for several years. By selling passage for five to seven years worth of work, they could then start on their own in America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html |title=Indentured Servitude in Colonial America |first=Deanna |last=Barker |date=10 March 2004 |publisher=National Association for Interpretation, Cultural Interpretation and Living History Section |accessdate=5 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022161033/http://geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html |archivedate=October 22, 2009 |df= }}</ref> Many of the migrants from England died in the first few years.<ref name=\"Taylor 2001\"/>\n\nEconomic advantage also prompted the [[Darien Scheme]], an ill-fated venture by the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] to settle the [[Isthmus of Panama]] in the late 1690s. The Darien Scheme aimed to control trade through that part of the world and thereby promote Scotland into a world trading power. However, it was doomed by poor planning, short provisions, weak leadership, lack of demand for trade goods, and devastating disease.<ref>John Prebble, ''Darien: the Scottish Dream of Empire'' (2000)</ref> The failure of the Darien Scheme was one of the factors that led the Kingdom of Scotland into the [[Act of Union 1707]] with the [[Kingdom of England]] creating the united [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and giving Scotland commercial access to English, now British, colonies.<ref>Brocklehurst, \"The Banker who Led Scotland to Disaster\".</ref>\n\nIn the French colonial regions, the focus of economy was on sugar plantations in Caribbean. In Canada the [[fur trade]] with the natives was important. About 16,000 French men and women became colonizers. The great majority became subsistence farmers along the [[St. Lawrence River]]. With a favorable disease environment and plenty of land and food, their numbers grew exponentially to 65,000 by 1760. Their colony was taken over by Britain in 1760, but social, religious, legal, cultural and economic changes were few in a society that clung tightly to its recently formed traditions.<ref>W.J.

English and Dutch colonies, on the other hand, tended to be more religiously diverse. Settlers to these colonies included [[Anglican]]s, Dutch [[Calvinists]], English [[Puritans]] and other [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformists]], [[Maryland Toleration Act|English Catholics]], Scottish [[Presbyterian]]s, French [[Huguenot]]s, German and Swedish [[Lutherans]], as well as [[Jews]], [[Quakers]], [[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and [[Moravian Church|Moravians]].<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the cope of heaven: Religion, society, and politics in Colonial America'' (2003).</ref>\n\nMany groups of colonists went to the Americas searching for the right to practice their religion without [[religious persecution|persecution]]. The [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century broke the unity of Western [[Christendom]] and led to the formation of numerous new religious sects, which often faced persecution by governmental authorities. In England, many people came to question the organization of the [[Church of England]] by the end of the 16th century. One of the primary manifestations of this was the [[Puritan]] movement, which sought to \"purify\" the existing Church of England of its residual Catholic rites.\n\nWaves of repression led to the migration of about 20,000 Puritans to [[New England]] between 1629 and 1642, where they founded multiple colonies. Later in the century, the new [[Pennsylvania]] colony was given to [[William Penn]] in settlement of a debt the king owed his father. Its government was established by William Penn in about 1682 to become primarily a refuge for persecuted English Quakers; but others were welcomed. Baptists, German and Swiss Protestants and [[Anabaptists]] also flocked to Pennsylvania. The lure of cheap land, religious freedom and the right to improve themselves with their own hand was very attractive.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Chester Miller|title=The First Frontier: Life in Colonial America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Oadlu2cSFUC&pg=PA80|year=1966|publisher=University Press of America|page=80|isbn=978-0-8191-4977-0}}</ref>\n\n==Forced immigration and enslavement==\n{{Main|Atlantic slave trade}}\n[[File:Tobacco cultivation (Virginia, ca. 1670).jpg|thumb|African slaves 17th-century [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], 1670.]]\n[[Slavery]] was a common practice in the [[Americas]] prior to the arrival of Europeans, as different American Indian groups captured and held other tribes' members as slaves.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's Guide to Black History |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=2014-02-28}}</ref> Many of these captives were forced to undergo [[human sacrifice]] in Amerindian civilizations such as the [[Aztecs]]. In response to some enslavement of natives in the [[Caribbean]] during the early years, the [[Spanish Crown]] passed a series of [[Laws of Burgos|laws prohibiting slavery]] as early as 1512. A new stricter set of laws was passed in 1542, called the ''New Laws of the Indies for the Good Treatment and Preservation of Indians'', or simply [[New Laws]]. These were created to prevent the exploitation of the indigenous peoples by the ''[[Encomienda|encomenderos]]'' or landowners, by strictly limiting their power and dominion.<ref>[[Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Icazbalceta|Garc\u00eda Icazbalceta, Joaqu\u00edn]] ''\"Colecci\u00f3n de documentos para la historia de M\u00e9xico\"'' \"Leyes y ordenanzas\" (Dada en la ciudad de Barcelona, a veinte d\u00edas del mes de Noviembre, a\u00f1o del nacimiento de nuestro Salvador Jesucristo de mill e quinientos e cuarenta y dos a\u00f1os) y addenda 4 de junio de 1543; 26 de junio de 1543; 26 de mayo de 1544 [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/06922752100647273089079/p0000026.htm text on Internet] Cervantes Virtual</ref> This helped curb Indian slavery considerably, though not completely. Later, with the arrival of other European colonial powers in the New World, the enslavement of native populations increased, as these empires lacked legislation against slavery until decades later. The population of indigenous peoples declined (mostly from European diseases, but also from forced exploitation and atrocities). Later, native workers were replaced by Africans imported through a large commercial slave trade.\n\nBy the 18th century, the overwhelming number of black slaves was such that [[Amerindian]] slavery was less commonly used. Africans, who were taken aboard slave ships to the Americas, were primarily obtained from their African homelands by coastal tribes who captured and sold them. Europeans traded for slaves with the slave capturers of the local native African tribes in exchange for rum, guns, gunpowder, and other manufactures.\n\n===Slavery===\n[[File:Hakewill, A Picturesque Tour of the Island of Jamaica, Plate 04.jpg|thumb|Harbour Street, [[Kingston, Jamaica]], c. 1820]]\nThe total [[slave trade]] to islands in the [[Caribbean]], [[Brazil]], Mexico and to the United States is estimated to have involved 12 million Africans.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ronald |last=Segal |author-link=Ronald Segal |title=The Black Diaspora: Five Centuries of the Black Experience Outside Africa |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780374524906 |url-access=registration |year=1995 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |isbn=978-0-374-11396-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780374524906/page/4 4] |quote=It is now estimated that 11,863,000 slaves were shipped across the Atlantic.

Such estimates may reflect historical population maxima, while indigenous populations may have been at a level somewhat below these maxima or in a moment of decline in the period just prior to contact with Europeans.

In their paper on institutions and long-run growth, economists [[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]], and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]] argue that certain natural endowments gave rise to distinct colonial policies promoting either smallholder or coerced labor production.<ref>Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A.

In these regions, landowning elites were economically incentivized to develop forced labor arrangements such as the Peru [[mit'a]] system or Argentinian [[latifundias]] without regard for democratic norms. French and British colonial leaders, conversely, were incentivized to develop [[Capitalism|capitalist]] markets, [[property rights]], and [[democratic institution]]<nowiki/>s in response to [[natural environment]]<nowiki/>s that supported [[smallholder]] production over forced labor.\n\n[[James Mahony|James Mahoney]], a professor at [[Northwestern University]], proposes that colonial policy choices made at critical junctures regarding land ownership in [[coffee]]-rich Central America fostered enduring [[path dependence|path dependent]] institutions.<ref>James Mahoney, \u201cPath-Dependent Explanations of Regime Change: Central America in Comparative Perspective.\u201d Studies in Comparative International Development, 2001.</ref> Coffee economies in [[Guatemala]] and [[El Salvador]], for example, were centralized around large plantations that operated under coercive labor systems. By the 19th century, their political structures were largely authoritarian and militarized. In [[Colombia]] and [[Costa Rica]], conversely, liberal reforms were enacted at critical junctures to expand [[commercial agriculture]], and they ultimately raised the [[bargaining power]] of the middle class. Both nations eventually developed more democratic and egalitarian institutions than their highly concentrated landowning counterparts.\n\n==List of European colonies in the Americas==\n[[File:Flickr - ronsaunders47 - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (2).jpg|thumb|[[Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic|Puerto Plata]], Dominican Republic.

Italy did exist in name, and the words \"Italy\" and \"Italians\" were commonly used at the time. See Name of Italy for more etymology --> explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed west to find a new trade route to the [[Far East]] but inadvertently landed in what came to be known to Europeans as the \"[[New World]]\". He ran aground on 5 December 1492 on the northern part of [[Hispaniola]], which the [[Ta\u00edno|Taino people]] had inhabited since the 9th century; the site became the first permanent European settlement in the Americas. Western European conquest, large-scale exploration and colonization soon followed. Columbus's first two voyages (1492\u201393) reached the [[Bahamas]] and various [[Caribbean islands]], including Hispaniola, [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Cuba]].

In the 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], ratified by the Pope, these two kingdoms divided the entire non-European world into two areas of exploration and colonization, with a north to south boundary that cut through the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern part of present-day Brazil. Based on this treaty and on early claims by Spanish explorer [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]], discoverer of the [[Pacific Ocean]] in 1513, the Spanish conquered large territories in North, Central and South America.\n\nAround the late 1490s, cartographer [[Amerigo Vespucci|Americo Vespuscio]] explored the American eastern coast, on behalf of both the Portuguese and Spanish crowns, and published in 1502\u20131503, his new book ''Mundus Novus'' (''New World''), which disproved the belief that the Americas were the easternmost part of Asia and, in actuallity, an entire new world.\n\n[[File:Non-Native-American-Nations-Territorial-Claims-over-NAFTA-countries-1750-2008.gif|thumb|Territorial evolution of North America of non-native nation states from 1750 to 2008]]\n[[File:Political Evolution of Central America and the Caribbean 1700 and on.gif|thumb|Central America and Caribbean sovereignty 1700\u2013present]]\n\nSpanish conquistador [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] took over the [[Aztec Empire|Aztec Kingdom]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]] conquered the [[Inca Empire]]. As a result, by the mid-16th century, the Spanish Crown had gained control of much of western South America, and southern [[North America]], in addition to its earlier [[Caribbean]] territories. Over this same timeframe, [[History of Portugal|Portugal]] claimed lands in North America (Canada) and colonized much of eastern South America, naming it [[History of Brazil|Santa Cruz and Brazil]].\n\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\nOther [[Europe]]an nations soon disputed the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas. England and [[Ancien R\u00e9gime in France|France]] attempted to plant colonies in the Americas in the 16th century, but these failed. England and France succeeded in establishing permanent colonies in the following century, along with the [[Dutch Republic]]. Some of these were on Caribbean islands, which had often already been conquered by the Spanish or depopulated by disease, while others were in eastern North America, which had not been colonized by Spain north of [[History of Florida|Florida]].\n\nEarly European possessions in North America included [[Spanish Florida]], [[Spanish New Mexico]], the English colonies of [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] (with its [[List of islands in the Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] offshoot, [[Bermuda]]) and [[New England Colonies|New England]], the French colonies of [[Acadia]] and [[Canada, New France|Canada]], the Swedish colony of [[New Sweden]], and the Dutch [[New Netherland]]. In the 18th century, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] revived its former colonies in [[Greenland]], while the [[Russian Empire]] gained a foothold in [[Russian America|Alaska]]. Denmark-Norway would later make several claims in the Caribbean, starting in the 1600s.\n\nAs more nations gained an interest in the colonization of the Americas, competition for territory became increasingly fierce. Colonists often faced the threat of attacks from neighboring colonies, as well as from indigenous tribes and [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirates]].\n\n==Early state-sponsored colonists==\n[[File:RUIDIAZ(1893) 1.083 JUAN PONCE DE LE\u00d3N.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] ([[Santerv\u00e1s de Campos]], [[Province of Valladolid|Valladolid]], [[Spain]])]]\n{{Further|Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Spanish colonization of the Americas|First European colonization wave (15th century\u201319th century)}}\nThe first phase of well-financed European activity in the Americas began with the Atlantic Ocean crossings of Christopher Columbus (1492\u20131504), sponsored by Spain, whose original attempt was to find a new route to India and China, known as \"[[Indies|the Indies]]\". He was followed by other explorers such as [[John Cabot]], who was sponsored by England and reached Newfoundland. [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] reached Brazil and claimed it for Portugal.\n\n[[Amerigo Vespucci]], working for Portugal in voyages from 1497 to 1513, established that Columbus had reached a new set of continents. [[Cartography|Cartographers]] still use a [[Latinization (literature)|Latinized]] version of his first name, ''America'', for the two continents. Other explorers included [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], sponsored by France in 1524; the Portuguese [[Jo\u00e3o Vaz Corte-Real]] in Newfoundland; [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]], [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real]] and [[Jo\u00e3o \u00c1lvares Fagundes]], in Newfoundland, Greenland, Labrador, and Nova Scotia (from 1498 to 1502, and in 1520); [[Jacques Cartier]] (1491\u20131557), [[Henry Hudson]] (1560s\u20131611), and [[Samuel de Champlain]] (1567\u20131635), who explored the region of Canada he reestablished as [[New France]].\n\nIn 1513, [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and led the first European expedition to see the Pacific Ocean from the [[History of the west coast of North America|west coast of the New World]]. In an action with enduring historical import, Balboa claimed the Pacific Ocean and all the lands adjoining it for the Spanish Crown. It was 1517 before another expedition, from [[Cuba]], visited Central America, [[Spanish colonization of the Yucat\u00e1n|landing on the coast of Yucat\u00e1n]] [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|in search of slaves]].\n\n[[File:Iberian Union Empires2.png|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese colonies]]\nThese explorations were followed, notably in the case of Spain, by a phase of conquest: The Spaniards, having just finished the ''[[Reconquista]]'' of Spain from Muslim rule, were the first to colonize the Americas, applying the same model of governing their European holdings to their territories of the [[New World]].\n\nTen years after Columbus's discovery, the administration of [[Hispaniola]] was given to [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando]] of the [[Order of Alc\u00e1ntara]], founded during the ''Reconquista''. As in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[Ta\u00edno people|inhabitants of Hispaniola]] were given new landmasters, while [[Roman Catholic religious order|religious orders]] handled the local administration. Progressively the ''[[encomienda]]'' system, which granted tribute (access to indigenous labor and taxation) to European settlers, was set in place.\n\nA relatively common misconception is that a small number of ''[[conquistadores]]'' conquered vast territories, aided only by disease epidemics and their powerful [[knight|caballeros]]. In fact, recent archaeological excavations have suggested a vast Spanish-Indian alliance numbering in the hundreds of thousands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferturperu.info/discovery-the-inca-rebellion-of-1536/ |title=1536 Inca Rebellion unearthed &#124; Peruvian Travel Trends |publisher=Ferturperu.info |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] eventually [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|conquered Mexico]] with the help of [[Tlaxcala]] in 1519\u20131521, while the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]] was supported by some 40,000 Incan renegades led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] in between 1532 and 1535.\n\nOver the first century and a half after Columbus's voyages, the native population of the Americas plummeted by an estimated 80% (from around 50 million in 1492 to eight million in 1650),<ref name=Histoire/> mostly by outbreaks of [[Old World]] [[Infectious diseases|diseases]].\n\nIn 1532, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] sent a vice-king to Mexico, [[Antonio de Mendoza]], in order to prevent Cortes' independentist drives, who definitively returned to Spain in 1540. Two years later, Charles V signed the [[New Laws]] (which replaced the [[Laws of Burgos]] of 1512) prohibiting slavery and the ''[[repartimientos]]'', but also claiming as his own all the lands of the Americas and all of the indigenous people as his own subjects.\n\n[[File:Cabrera Pintura de Castas.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting depicting a [[Castas]] with his mixed-race daughter and his [[Mulatta]] wife by [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], 1763]]\nWhen Pope [[Alexander VI]] issued the ''[[Inter caetera]]'' bull in May 1493 granting the new lands to the [[Kingdom of Spain]], he requested in exchange an [[Roman Catholic Church and colonialism|evangelization of the people]]. Thus, during [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s second voyage, [[Benedictine]] monks accompanied him, along with twelve other priests. As [[Slavery in medieval Europe|slavery]] was prohibited between Christians, and could only be imposed in non-Christian prisoners of war or on men already sold as slaves, the debate on Christianization was particularly acute during the 16th century. In 1537, the papal bull ''[[Sublimis Deus]]'' definitively recognized that Native Americans possessed souls, thus prohibiting their enslavement, without putting an end to the debate. Some claimed that a native who had rebelled and then been captured could be enslaved nonetheless.\n\nLater, the [[Valladolid debate]] between the Dominican priest [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]] and another Dominican [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Juan Gin\u00e9s de Sep\u00falveda]] was held, with the former arguing that Native Americans were beings doted{{clarify|date=October 2018|reason=explanation of word \"doted\" for which clarification requested}} with souls, as all other human beings, while the latter argued to the contrary and justified their enslavement.\n\nThe process of Christianization was at first violent: when the first [[Franciscan]]s arrived in Mexico in 1524, they burned the places dedicated to pagan cult, alienating much of the local population.<ref name=Histoire2/> In the 1530s, they began to adapt Christian practices to local customs, including the building of new churches on the sites of ancient places of worship, leading to a mix of Old World Christianity with local religions.<ref name=Histoire2>\"Espagnols-Indiens: le choc des civilisations\", in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n\u00b0322, July\u2013August 2007, pp. 14\u201321 (interview with Christian Duverger, teacher at the [[EHESS]])</ref> The [[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Spanish Roman Catholic Church]], needing the natives' labor and cooperation, evangelized in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] and other Native American languages, contributing to the expansion of these [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]] and equipping some of them with writing systems. One of the first primitive schools for Native Americans was founded by Fray [[Pedro de Gante]] in 1523.\n\nTo reward their troops, the ''Conquistadores'' often allotted Indian towns to their troops and officers. Black African slaves were introduced to substitute for Native American labor in some locations\u2014including the [[West Indies]], where the indigenous population was nearing extinction on many islands.\n\nDuring this time, the Portuguese gradually switched from an initial plan of establishing trading posts to extensive [[colonization]] of what is now Brazil. They imported millions of slaves to run their plantations. The Portuguese and Spanish royal governments expected to rule these settlements and collect at least 20% of all treasure found (the ''[[quinto real]]'' collected by the ''[[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]]''), in addition to collecting all the taxes they could.

They were sponsored by [[common stock]] companies such as the chartered [[London Company|Virginia Company]] financed by wealthy Englishmen who exaggerated the economic potential of this new land. The main purpose of this colony was the hope of finding gold.<ref name=\"Taylor 2001\"/>\n\nIt took strong leaders, like [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]], to convince the colonists of Jamestown that searching for gold was not taking care of their immediate needs for food and shelter and the [[Bible|biblical]] principle that \"he who will not work shall not eat\" (see [[2 Thessalonians 3]]). The lack of [[food security]] leading to extremely high mortality rate was quite distressing and cause for despair among the colonists. To support the Colony, numerous [[Jamestown supply missions|supply missions]] were organized. [[Tobacco]] later became a cash crop, with the work of [[John Rolfe]] and others, for export and the sustaining economic driver of [[Virginia]] and the neighboring colony of [[Maryland]].\n\nFrom the beginning of Virginia's settlements in 1587 until the 1680s, the main source of labor and a large portion of the immigrants were [[indentured servants]] looking for new life in the overseas colonies. During the 17th century, indentured servants constituted three-quarters of all European immigrants to the Chesapeake region. Most of the indentured servants were teenagers from England with poor economic prospects at home. Their fathers signed the papers that gave them free passage to America and an unpaid job until they became of age. They were given food, clothing, housing and taught farming or household skills. American landowners were in need of laborers and were willing to pay for a laborer's passage to America if they served them for several years. By selling passage for five to seven years worth of work, they could then start on their own in America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html |title=Indentured Servitude in Colonial America |first=Deanna |last=Barker |date=10 March 2004 |publisher=National Association for Interpretation, Cultural Interpretation and Living History Section |accessdate=5 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022161033/http://geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html |archivedate=October 22, 2009 |df= }}</ref> Many of the migrants from England died in the first few years.<ref name=\"Taylor 2001\"/>\n\nEconomic advantage also prompted the [[Darien Scheme]], an ill-fated venture by the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] to settle the [[Isthmus of Panama]] in the late 1690s. The Darien Scheme aimed to control trade through that part of the world and thereby promote Scotland into a world trading power. However, it was doomed by poor planning, short provisions, weak leadership, lack of demand for trade goods, and devastating disease.<ref>John Prebble, ''Darien: the Scottish Dream of Empire'' (2000)</ref> The failure of the Darien Scheme was one of the factors that led the Kingdom of Scotland into the [[Act of Union 1707]] with the [[Kingdom of England]] creating the united [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and giving Scotland commercial access to English, now British, colonies.<ref>Brocklehurst, \"The Banker who Led Scotland to Disaster\".</ref>\n\nIn the French colonial regions, the focus of economy was on sugar plantations in Caribbean. In Canada the [[fur trade]] with the natives was important. About 16,000 French men and women became colonizers. The great majority became subsistence farmers along the [[St. Lawrence River]]. With a favorable disease environment and plenty of land and food, their numbers grew exponentially to 65,000 by 1760. Their colony was taken over by Britain in 1760, but social, religious, legal, cultural and economic changes were few in a society that clung tightly to its recently formed traditions.<ref>W.J.

English and Dutch colonies, on the other hand, tended to be more religiously diverse. Settlers to these colonies included [[Anglican]]s, Dutch [[Calvinists]], English [[Puritans]] and other [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformists]], [[Maryland Toleration Act|English Catholics]], Scottish [[Presbyterian]]s, French [[Huguenot]]s, German and Swedish [[Lutherans]], as well as [[Jews]], [[Quakers]], [[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and [[Moravian Church|Moravians]].<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the cope of heaven: Religion, society, and politics in Colonial America'' (2003).</ref>\n\nMany groups of colonists went to the Americas searching for the right to practice their religion without [[religious persecution|persecution]]. The [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century broke the unity of Western [[Christendom]] and led to the formation of numerous new religious sects, which often faced persecution by governmental authorities. In England, many people came to question the organization of the [[Church of England]] by the end of the 16th century. One of the primary manifestations of this was the [[Puritan]] movement, which sought to \"purify\" the existing Church of England of its residual Catholic rites.\n\nWaves of repression led to the migration of about 20,000 Puritans to [[New England]] between 1629 and 1642, where they founded multiple colonies. Later in the century, the new [[Pennsylvania]] colony was given to [[William Penn]] in settlement of a debt the king owed his father. Its government was established by William Penn in about 1682 to become primarily a refuge for persecuted English Quakers; but others were welcomed.

In response to some enslavement of natives in the [[Caribbean]] during the early years, the [[Spanish Crown]] passed a series of [[Laws of Burgos|laws prohibiting slavery]] as early as 1512. A new stricter set of laws was passed in 1542, called the ''New Laws of the Indies for the Good Treatment and Preservation of Indians'', or simply [[New Laws]]. These were created to prevent the exploitation of the indigenous peoples by the ''[[Encomienda|encomenderos]]'' or landowners, by strictly limiting their power and dominion.<ref>[[Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Icazbalceta|Garc\u00eda Icazbalceta, Joaqu\u00edn]] ''\"Colecci\u00f3n de documentos para la historia de M\u00e9xico\"'' \"Leyes y ordenanzas\" (Dada en la ciudad de Barcelona, a veinte d\u00edas del mes de Noviembre, a\u00f1o del nacimiento de nuestro Salvador Jesucristo de mill e quinientos e cuarenta y dos a\u00f1os) y addenda 4 de junio de 1543; 26 de junio de 1543; 26 de mayo de 1544 [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/06922752100647273089079/p0000026.htm text on Internet] Cervantes Virtual</ref> This helped curb Indian slavery considerably, though not completely. Later, with the arrival of other European colonial powers in the New World, the enslavement of native populations increased, as these empires lacked legislation against slavery until decades later. The population of indigenous peoples declined (mostly from European diseases, but also from forced exploitation and atrocities). Later, native workers were replaced by Africans imported through a large commercial slave trade.\n\nBy the 18th century, the overwhelming number of black slaves was such that [[Amerindian]] slavery was less commonly used. Africans, who were taken aboard slave ships to the Americas, were primarily obtained from their African homelands by coastal tribes who captured and sold them. Europeans traded for slaves with the slave capturers of the local native African tribes in exchange for rum, guns, gunpowder, and other manufactures.\n\n===Slavery===\n[[File:Hakewill, A Picturesque Tour of the Island of Jamaica, Plate 04.jpg|thumb|Harbour Street, [[Kingston, Jamaica]], c. 1820]]\nThe total [[slave trade]] to islands in the [[Caribbean]], [[Brazil]], Mexico and to the United States is estimated to have involved 12 million Africans.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ronald |last=Segal |author-link=Ronald Segal |title=The Black Diaspora: Five Centuries of the Black Experience Outside Africa |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780374524906 |url-access=registration |year=1995 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |isbn=978-0-374-11396-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780374524906/page/4 4] |quote=It is now estimated that 11,863,000 slaves were shipped across the Atlantic.

The [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) proposed a new railway line between [[Northampton]] and [[Market Harborough]].\n\nThe line was designed by [[George Robert Stephenson (engineer)|George R. Stephenson]] (nephew of the Railway Pioneer [[George Stephenson]]) and [[George Parker Bidder]], and was opened in 1859.\n\nThe line includes two tunnels: [[Kelmarsh Tunnel]], {{convert|322|yd|m}}; and [[Oxendon Tunnel]] {{convert|462|yd|m}} on the Down line and {{convert|453|yd|m}} on the Up line. Because the line was originally single track and later doubled, each tunnel consists of two separate bores, one for each track. One bore of each tunnel is open as part of the [[Brampton Valley Way]].\n\nIn the British Rail report \"British Railways Network for Development\" of March 1967, the line was shown as part of the passenger and freight network for development. At about the same time, the two road overbridges along the line were rebuilt in order to provide clearances for 25\u00a0kV 50\u00a0Hz electrification, which was to be carried through to [[Leicester]]. At the time, it was envisaged that the [[Midland Main Line]] between [[Market Harborough]] and [[Bedford]] (despite also being included as \"for development\" in the report) would be closed to passengers, with services between London and [[Leicester]] re-routed via [[Northampton railway station]] to [[London Euston]], along with the closure and demolition of London [[St. Pancras Station]]. The closure of St. Pancras and the electrification between Northampton and Market Harborough did not take place but the raised overbridges are still visible at Brampton and Brixworth station sites.\n\n==Stations==\nWhen the line opened, there were only three intermediate stations, at Pitsford, Brixworth and Lamport. Further stations were opened, although almost all were closed by 1960.\n*{{stnlnk|Northampton (Bridge Street)}}\n*{{stnlnk|Northampton (Castle)}} \u2013 originally a minor station\n*{{stnlnk|Pitsford and Brampton}}\n*{{stnlnk|Spratton}}\n*{{stnlnk|Brixworth}}\n*{{stnlnk|Lamport}}\n*{{stnlnk|Kelmarsh}}\n*{{stnlnk|Clipston and Oxendon}}\n*{{stnlnk|Market Harborough}}\n\nThe original LNWR station at {{stnlnk|Market Harborough}} was on its {{stnlnk|Stamford}} to {{stnlnk|Rugby}} line which opened in 1850. From 1857 it was shared by the [[Midland Railway]] on the \"London Extension\" from {{stnlnk|Leicester}} to {{stnlnk|Bedford}}. As traffic built up, the Midland built a new line at a higher elevation, crossing the LNWR and then running parallel to a new joint station in the present position, which opened in 1885.<ref>Radford, B., (1983) ''Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby'' London: Bloomsbury Books</ref>\n[[File:Brixworth Station 1910762 f63b11d2.jpg|thumb|right|Brixworth Station in 1965]]\n\n==Closure==\n[[File:25181 25106 Merry Tom 19750613.jpg|thumb|25181 and 25106 lead an aggreate train towards Northampton at Merry Tom Crossing 06:50  1975-06-13]]\n[[File:8137 8042 Spratton 1973-03-18 -O.jpg|thumb|Class 20s 8137 and 8042 lead northbound coal empties past the site of Spratton station on Sunday 1973-03-18. At this time, the line was normally open from 22:00 to 14:00, Mondays to Saturdays. On this occasion, Sunday opening was necessary to clear a traffic backlog after industrial action by rail workers.]]\nThe line had a staggered history in its final years. It was first closed to advertised passenger traffic on 4 January 1960 along with all remaining intermediate stations ([[Spratton|Spratton station]] was closed during in 1947; Pitsford & Brampton in 1950) but was re-opened to through traffic on 6 January 1969 in conjunction with the re-routing of sleeping car services away from [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras]]. The one train each way per night was electrically hauled between Euston and Northampton and by a Class 45 locomotive between Northampton and Glasgow. It did not call at Market Harborough. The line was closed to passenger traffic again on 1 May 1969 and reopened on 10 July 1972. The advertised passenger service was finally withdrawn on 26 August 1973, although the line continued to be used by freight trains, football specials and as a diversionary route.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the staple traffic declined considerably, consisting principally of coal trains from the Nottinghamshire coalfields to London and their norhtbound empties. \n\nThe line had several manual level crossings. Each of these required a mechanical signalbox to be maintained and staffed, leading to high fixed costs, which were only slightly reduced by staffing the boxes for only one or two shifts per day, according to traffic needs. Proposals to automate the level crossings were met with hostility by locals in the wake of the [[Hixon rail crash]]. Although the line was considered useful by the operators as a diversionary route, the high costs and diminishing coal traffic led to its closure at a time when [[British Rail]] was under great pressure from government to close marginal lines.\n\nOn 15 August 1981, the day before closure, a special train was chartered to run from Northampton to Market Harborough and return. This was the last [[British Rail]] passenger train to run on the line.\n\n==Heritage Railway==\n{{main|Northampton & Lamport Railway}}\nThe ''Welland Valley Rail Revival Group'' which had campaigned to keep the line open changed its name to ''Northampton Steam Railway'' and based itself in the old goods yard at Pitsford and Brampton station. The track was lifted by British Rail and the trackbed was sold to [[Northamptonshire County Council]] for use as a \"linear park\" named the [[Brampton Valley Way]].\n\nThe Railway Society arranged to lease part of the trackbed from the County Council and began rebuilding the line as a [[heritage railway]]. The name was changed in 1992 to ''Northampton & Lamport Railway'' due to the presence of a large number of [[diesel locomotive]]s. A [[Light Railway Order]] was granted and the Grand Opening took place on 31 March 1996.\n\n==Potential Reopening==\n\nIn October 2019, Transport Secretary [[Grant Shapps]] backed proposals to reopen the Northampton to Market Harborough line.<ref>[https://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/people/government-backs-re-opening-railway-link-from-northampton-to-market-harborough-1-9120150 Government backs re-opening railway link from Northampton to Market Harborough] Northamtpon Chronicle & Echo; 25 October 2019</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Northampton-Market Harborough line}}\n[[Category:London and North Western Railway]]\n[[Category:Closed railway lines in the East Midlands]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Northamptonshire]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Leicestershire]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1859]]\n[[Category:Railway lines closed in 1981]]\n[[Category:1859 establishments in England]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:1975-04-26 Football Special at Brixworth.jpg|thumb|A Class 47 approaches the site of Brixworth station hauling a rugby fan special from Wembley on 26 April 1975.]]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2014}}\n{{Northampton to Market Harborough line}}\n\nThe '''Northampton\u2013Market Harborough line''' is a closed [[railway line]] in [[England]].

Stephenson]] (nephew of the Railway Pioneer [[George Stephenson]]) and [[George Parker Bidder]], and was opened in 1859.\n\nThe line includes two tunnels: [[Kelmarsh Tunnel]], {{convert|322|yd|m}}; and [[Oxendon Tunnel]] {{convert|462|yd|m}} on the Down line and {{convert|453|yd|m}} on the Up line. Because the line was originally single track and later doubled, each tunnel consists of two separate bores, one for each track. One bore of each tunnel is open as part of the [[Brampton Valley Way]].\n\nIn the British Rail report \"British Railways Network for Development\" of March 1967, the line was shown as part of the passenger and freight network for development. At about the same time, the two road overbridges along the line were rebuilt in order to provide clearances for 25kV 50Hz electrification, which was to be carried through to [[Leicester]]. At the time, it was envisaged that the [[Midland Main Line]] between [[Market Harborough]] and [[Bedford]] (despite also being included as \"for development\" in the report) would be closed to passengers, with services between London and [[Leicester]] re-routed via [[Northampton railway station]] to [[London Euston]], along with the closure and demolition of London [[St. Pancras Station]]. The closure of St. Pancras and the electrification between Northampton and Market Harborough did not take place but the raised overbridges are still visible at Brampton and Brixworth station sites.\n\n==Stations==\nWhen the line opened, there were only three intermediate stations, at Pitsford, Brixworth and Lamport. Further stations were opened, although almost all were closed by 1960.\n*{{stnlnk|Northampton (Bridge Street)}}\n*{{stnlnk|Northampton (Castle)}} \u2013 originally a minor station\n*{{stnlnk|Pitsford and Brampton}}\n*{{stnlnk|Spratton}}\n*{{stnlnk|Brixworth}}\n*{{stnlnk|Lamport}}\n*{{stnlnk|Kelmarsh}}\n*{{stnlnk|Clipston and Oxendon}}\n*{{stnlnk|Market Harborough}}\n\nThe original LNWR station at {{stnlnk|Market Harborough}} was on its {{stnlnk|Stamford}} to {{stnlnk|Rugby}} line which opened in 1850. From 1857 it was shared by the [[Midland Railway]] on the \"London Extension\" from {{stnlnk|Leicester}} to {{stnlnk|Bedford}}. As traffic built up, the Midland built a new line at a higher elevation, crossing the LNWR and then running parallel to a new joint station in the present position, which opened in 1885.<ref>Radford, B., (1983) ''Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby'' London: Bloomsbury Books</ref>\n[[File:Brixworth Station 1910762 f63b11d2.jpg|thumb|right|Brixworth Station in 1965]]\n\n==Closure==\n[[File:25181 25106 Merry Tom 19750613.jpg|thumb|25181 and 25106 lead an aggreate train towards Northampton at Merry Tom Crossing 06:50  1975-06-13]]\n[[File:8137 8042 Spratton 1973-03-18 -O.jpg|thumb|Class 20s 8137 and 8042 lead northbound coal empties past the site of Spratton station on Sunday 1973-03-18. At this time, the line was normally open from 22:00 to 14:00, Mondays to Saturdays. On this occasion, Sunday opening was necessary to clear a traffic backlog after industrial action by rail workers.]]\nThe line had a staggered history in its final years. It was first closed to advertised passenger traffic on 4 January 1960 along with all remaining intermediate stations ([[Spratton|Spratton station]] was closed during in 1947; Pitsford & Brampton in 1950) but was re-opened to through traffic on 6 January 1969 in conjunction with the re-routing of sleeping car services away from [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras]]. The one train each way per night was electrically hauled between Euston and Northampton and by a Class 45 locomotive between Northampton and Glasgow. It did not call at Market Harborough. The line was closed to passenger traffic again on 1 May 1969 and reopened on 10 July 1972. The advertised passenger service was finally withdrawn on 26 August 1973, although the line continued to be used by freight trains, football specials and as a diversionary route.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the staple traffic declined considerably, consisting principally of coal trains from the Nottinghamshire coalfields to London and their norhtbound empties. \n\nThe line had several manual level crossings. Each of these required a mechanical signalbox to be maintained and staffed, leading to high fixed costs, which were only slightly reduced by staffing the boxes for only one or two shifts per day, according to traffic needs. Proposals to automate the level crossings were met with hostility by locals in the wake of the [[Hixon rail crash]]. Although the line was considered useful by the operators as a diversionary route, the high costs and diminishing coal traffic led to its closure at a time when [[British Rail]] was under great pressure from government to close marginal lines.\n\nOn 15 August 1981, the day before closure, a special train was chartered to run from Northampton to Market Harborough and return. This was the last [[British Rail]] passenger train to run on the line.\n\n==Heritage Railway==\n{{main|Northampton & Lamport Railway}}\nThe ''Welland Valley Rail Revival Group'' which had campaigned to keep the line open changed its name to ''Northampton Steam Railway'' and based itself in the old goods yard at Pitsford and Brampton station. The track was lifted by British Rail and the trackbed was sold to [[Northamptonshire County Council]] for use as a \"linear park\" named the [[Brampton Valley Way]].\n\nThe Railway Society arranged to lease part of the trackbed from the County Council and began rebuilding the line as a [[heritage railway]]. The name was changed in 1992 to ''Northampton & Lamport Railway'' due to the presence of a large number of [[diesel locomotive]]s. A [[Light Railway Order]] was granted and the Grand Opening took place on 31 March 1996.\n\n==Potential Reopening==\n\nIn October 2019, Transport Secretary [[Grant Shapps]] backed proposals to reopen the Northampton to Market Harborough line.<ref>[https://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/people/government-backs-re-opening-railway-link-from-northampton-to-market-harborough-1-9120150 Government backs re-opening railway link from Northampton to Market Harborough] Northamtpon Chronicle & Echo; 25 October 2019</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Northampton-Market Harborough line}}\n[[Category:London and North Western Railway]]\n[[Category:Closed railway lines in the East Midlands]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Northamptonshire]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Leicestershire]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1859]]\n[[Category:Railway lines closed in 1981]]\n[[Category:1859 establishments in England]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "fmt (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northampton%E2%80%93Market_Harborough_line"}

He is most famous for being the first to attempt the [[standardisation]] of the [[Basque language]] and for the translation of religious works into Basque, in particular the first Basque translation of the [[New Testament]].\n\nFrench spellings of his name are often encountered in older works, for example ''Ioannes Lei\u00e7arraga'' and ''Jean de Li\u00e7arrague'' and various other  spellings of his surname such as ''Leissarrague'' or ''Lei\u00e7arraga''. or in Spanish '''Juan de Liz\u00e1rraga'''.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Briscous-mairie-004.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Leizarraga in [[Briscous|Beskoitze (Briscous)]] near Bayonne]]\n[[File:Leizarraga biblia 01.png|thumb|Cover of the New Testament's translation, ''IESVS CHIST GVRE IAVNAREN TESTAMENTV BERRIA'' (1571)]]\n\n===Early years===\nLeizarraga was born in the [[Northern Basque Country]] in the province of [[Labourd]] in a village called [[Briscous]] in 1506. Although the village was in Labourd, it fell within the area of the [[Lower Navarrese]] dialect of Basque. His family's farmhouse bore the family's name, Leizarraga, and stood in Briscous until it was destroyed in 1944. Very little is known about Leizarraga's early years beyond these few facts.\n\n===Priesthood===\nLeizarraga was baptised a [[Catholic]]. Although it is not known where he trained, he was trained as a priest and converted to [[Protestantism]] in 1560. By 1563, his name is mentioned in the records of the Protestant Synod of [[B\u00e9arn]].\n\nIn his dedication of the New Testament to [[Jeanne d'Albret]] he mentions having spent time in prison but again, it is not known which prison he was in, what the charge was or how long he was imprisoned for.\n\nHe was instituted as [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the church in [[La Bastide-Clairence|Bastide]] in [[Lower Navarre]] in 1567 by Jeanne d'Albret. By the time Leizarraga came to Bastide, the majority of inhabitants were not speaking Basque but [[Gascon language|Gascon]], since it had come to be populated by a Gascon colony. Nonetheless, Leizarraga was even in his time renowned as a great scholar of the Basque language, the very reason he would later be entrusted with the translation of the New Testament. It is also known that various Basque shepherds in the area sent their children to him so that he would teach them Basque.\n\nHe was married but it is not known when or to whom.\n\nIn March 1563 Leizarraga was instructed by [[Jeanne d'Albret]], the Queen of [[Navarre]] at the Synod of B\u00e9arn to produce a Basque translation of the New Testament. Having negotiated the tricky issue of translating into a language which by then had no great written tradition, common standard or spelling system, he persevered with some help from four old Catholic colleagues: Piarres Landetxeberri from [[Esp\u00e8s-Undurein]], Sanz de Tartas from [[Charritte-de-Bas]] (both in [[Soule]]), Joanes Etxeberri from [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] and a Mr Tardets who was a minister in [[Ostabat]]. Finally, in 1571, the printer Pierre Hautin based in [[La Rochelle]] printed three works by Leizarraga, amongst them is translation of the New Testament.\n\nIt is indicative of the respect he commanded that in 1582 he was visited by [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]], the man who would later negotiate the [[Edict of Nantes]] on religious tolerance. In his writings, Thou mentions Leizarraga and the copy of the Basque translation of the New Testament he had been given as a gift during his visit. This copy today is in the [[National Library of France]].\n\nIt is also Thou who mentions the exceptionally harmonious relationship between Protestants and Catholics in Bastide where according to him both faiths were worshipped in the church, something that was rare in 16th century France which is known for its [[French Wars of Religion|religious wars]].\n\nBy 1594 Leizarraga was no longer attending the Synod of B\u00e9arn, the record stating ''Monsieur de Lissarrague, ministre de Labastide de Clarence, excus\u00e9 pour sa vieillesse et pour son indisposition'' \"Mr Liazarraga, minister of Bastida, makes his excuse due to old age and being indisposed''.<ref>Urbistondo-Picavea, M.

Apart from the New Testament's main text, his translation also includes the following addenda:\n*''Testamentu Berrian diraden icen propri Hebraico eta Greco batzu\u00e9n declarationeo'' (\"Listing of some of the Hebrew and Greek proper names contained in the New Testament\"), 3 pages\n*''Testamentu Berrico hitz eta mincatzeco manera difficil bakoitz batzu bere declaration\u00e9quin'' (\"Listing with explanations of a number of difficult words and expressions of the New Testament\"), 13 pages\n*''\u00c7uberoaco herrian usan\u00e7atan eztiraden hitz bakoitz batzu hango an\u00e7ora itzuliac'' (\"Some words not used in [[Zuberoa]] with their local equivalents\"), 2 pages\n*''Testamentu Berrico materien erideteco taul\u00e1'' (\"A table for finding topics of the New Testament\"),  48 pages\n*a long section on how to conduct ecclesiastical ceremonies:\n**''Othoitza ecclesiasticoen forma'' (\"The way of ecclesiastical prayer\"), 15 pages\n**''Baptismoaren administratzeco form'' (\"The way of administering baptism\"), 6 pages\n**''Cenaren celebratzeco forma'' (\"The way of celebrating mass\"), 5 pages\n**''Ezconcaren celebratzeco forma'' (\"The way of celebrating a wedding\"), 5 pages\n**''Erien visitatzeaz'' (\"On visiting the ill\"), 2 pages\n**''Catechismea, cein erran nahi baita, Iesus Christen doctrin\u00e1n haourr\u00e9n iracasteco form\u00e1...'' (\"The [[Catechism]], meaning the way of teaching the doctrine of Jesus Christ to children...\"), a 62-page section in a question and answer format\n*a short treatise on the life of a Christian\n\nThe ''Kalendrera'' is short, 15 page calendar with monthly listings of religious events and holidays, the ''ABC'' a short collection of common prayers and instructions on how to conduct daily worship.\n\n===Critical appraisal===\nThe main criticism that has been made of his work is that he often used Romance loanwords where native terms exist. For example, he translates \"fisher of men\" as ''giza pescadorea'' rather than ''giza arrantzalea''. At the same time, he uses grammatical forms which were most likely archaic even in his period.\n\nThe other main criticism was, that as an over-regional standard, he based his standard too much on his native [[Lapurdian|Lapurdian dialect]] and the two other Northern dialects with very little regard to the Southern dialects. However, it must be remembered that he was the first to tackle standardisation and that there was no previous work he could build upon and that with his limited resources he had to carry out most of the work himself.\n\nOverall, the quality of his translations and the thoroughness of his effort at standardising Basque were and are recognised today, and have in no small way contributed to the formation of [[Standard Basque]].\n\n===Leizarraga as a source===\nLeizarraga's texts provide a wealth of data on the Basque of his time.\n*His work includes one of the few documented tripersonal verb forms where the direct object is not in the third person: ''gommendatzen cerauzquiotet'' \"I recommend you to them\", which is a type of [[Basque verbs|Basque verb formation]] no longer in use.<ref>[[Larry Trask|Trask, L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997</ref>\n*He is one of the first known authors to have used the term ''heuscal herria'' ([[Euskal Herria]] in modern spelling, meaning \"Basque Country\").\n\nAs an example, the following is a comparison between Leizarraga's version and the modern version of the Lord's prayer (in Leizarraga's orthography):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!

His form of Basque was largely based on the Northern dialects [[Lapurdian]], [[Zuberoan]] and [[Lower Navarrese]] which at the time were considered the prestigious varieties of Basque.\n\nHe discusses the issue of dialectal divergence in the foreword and says:\n{{quote|''...batbederac daqui heuscal herri\u00e3 quasi etche batetic bercera-ere min\u00e7atzeco maner\u00e1n cer differenti\u00e1 eta diuersitatea den...'' [everyone knows how the manner of speaking almost changes from one house to the next in the Basque Country]}}\n\nIn the 20th century, [[Federico Krutwig]] proposed to [[Euskaltzaindia|the Basque Academy]] Leizarraga's language as the basis for Modern Standard Basque, but his ideas did not get enough support.\n\n==References==\n*[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]]: \"Die Bedeutung der Sprache in Renaissance und Reformation und die Entstehung der baskischen Literatur im religi\u00f6sen und politischen Konfliktgebiet zwischen Spanien und Frankreich\" In: Wolfgang W.

(\"The [[Catechism]], meaning the way of teaching the doctrine of Jesus Christ to children...\"), a 62-page section in a question and answer format\n*a short treatise on the life of a Christian\n\nThe ''Kalendrera'' is short, 15 page calendar with monthly listings of religious events and holidays, the ''ABC'' a short collection of common prayers and instructions on how to conduct daily worship.\n\n===Critical appraisal===\nThe main criticism that has been made of his work is that he often used Romance loanwords where native terms exist. For example, he translates \"fisher of men\" as ''giza pescadorea'' rather than ''giza arrantzalea''. At the same time, he uses grammatical forms which were most likely archaic even in his period.\n\nThe other main criticism was, that as an over-regional standard, he based his standard too much on his native [[Lapurdian|Lapurdian dialect]] and the two other Northern dialects with very little regard to the Southern dialects. However, it must be remembered that he was the first to tackle standardisation and that there was no previous work he could build upon and that with his limited resources he had to carry out most of the work himself.\n\nOverall, the quality of his translations and the thoroughness of his effort at standardising Basque were and are recognised today, and have in no small way contributed to the formation of [[Standard Basque]].\n\n===Leizarraga as a source===\nLeizarraga's texts provide a wealth of data on the Basque of his time.\n*His work includes one of the few documented tripersonal verb forms where the direct object is not in the third person: ''gommendatzen cerauzquiotet'' \"I recommend you to them\", which is a type of [[Basque verbs|Basque verb formation]] no longer in use.<ref>[[Larry Trask|Trask, L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997</ref>\n*He is one of the first known authors to have used the term ''heuscal herria'' ([[Euskal Herria]] in modern spelling, meaning \"Basque Country\").\n\nAs an example, the following is a comparison between Leizarraga's version and the modern version of the Lord's prayer (in Leizarraga's orthography):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!

His form of Basque was largely based on the Northern dialects [[Lapurdian]], [[Zuberoan]] and [[Lower Navarrese]] which at the time were considered the prestigious varieties of Basque.\n\nHe discusses the issue of dialectal divergence in the foreword and says:\n{{quote|''...batbederac daqui heuscal herri\u00e3 quasi etche batetic bercera-ere min\u00e7atzeco maner\u00e1n cer differenti\u00e1 eta diuersitatea den...'' [everyone knows how the manner of speaking almost changes from one house to the next in the Basque Country]}}\n\nIn the 20th century, [[Federico Krutwig]] proposed to [[Euskaltzaindia|the Basque Academy]] Leizarraga's language as the basis for Modern Standard Basque, but his ideas did not get enough support.\n\n==References==\n*[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]]: \"Die Bedeutung der Sprache in Renaissance und Reformation und die Entstehung der baskischen Literatur im religi\u00f6sen und politischen Konfliktgebiet zwischen Spanien und Frankreich\" In: Wolfgang W.
