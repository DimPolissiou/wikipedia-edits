For these achievements. Munk received a number of prestigious awards including the [[National Medal of Science]], the [[Kyoto Prize]], and induction to the French [[Legion of Honour]].\n\nMunk worked on a wide range of topics, including [[Surface wave|surface waves]], geophysical implications of [[Milankovitch cycles|variations in the Earth's rotation]], [[tide]]s, [[internal wave]]s, deep-ocean drilling into the sea floor, acoustical measurements of ocean properties, [[sea level rise]], and [[Global warming|climate change]]. Beginning in 1975, Munk and [[Carl Wunsch]] developed [[ocean acoustic tomography]], to exploit the ease with which sound travels in the ocean and use acoustical signals for measurement of broad-scale temperature and current. In a 1991 experiment, Munk and his collaborators investigated the ability of underwater sound to propagate from the Southern Indian Ocean across all ocean basins. The aim was to measure global ocean temperature. The experiment was criticized by environmental groups, who expected that the loud acoustic signals would adversely affect marine life. Munk continued to develop and advocate for acoustical measurements of the ocean throughout his career.\n\nMunk's career was long and complicated. World War II disrupted his doctoral studies at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] (Scripps), and led to his participation in U.S. military research efforts.  Munk and his doctoral advisor [[Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)|Harald Sverdrup]] developed methods for forecasting wave conditions which were used in support of beach landings in all theaters of the war.  He was involved with oceanographic programs during the [[Operation Crossroads|atomic bomb tests in Bikini Atoll]].  For most of his career, he was a professor of [[geophysics]] at Scripps at the [[University of California]] in [[La Jolla, California|La Jolla]].  Additionally, Munk and his wife [[Judith Munk|Judy]] were active in developing the Scripps campus and integrating it with the new [[University of California, San Diego]]. Munk's career included a number of prestigious positions, including being a member of the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON]] [[think tank]], and holding the Secretary of the Navy/Chief of Naval Operations Oceanography Chair.   \n\n== Early life and education ==\nIn 1917, Munk was born to a Jewish family in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref name=\"NYTimes1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/science/walter-munk-einstein-of-the-oceans-at-97.html|title=Walter Munk, the 'Einstein of the Oceans'|last=Galbraith|first=Kate|date=August 24, 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 10, 2019|language=en-US}}</ref> His father, Dr. Hans Munk, and his mother, Rega Brunner, divorced when he was ten years old.<ref name=\"70yrs\"/>{{rp|14}}<ref name=\"DDay\"/> His maternal grandfather was Lucian Brunner (1850\u20131914), a prominent banker and Austrian politician.

Later estimates agreed well with Munk's predictions.<ref name=Pond/>\n\n===Rotation of the Earth===\nIn the 1950s, Munk investigated irregularities in the Earth's rotation \u2013 [[Day length fluctuations|changes in the length of day]] (rate of the Earth's rotation) and changes in the axis of rotation (such as the [[Chandler wobble]], which has a period of about 14 months). The latter gives rise to a small tide called the [[Long period tide#Pole tide|pole tide]]. Although the scientific community knew of these fluctuations, they did not have adequate explanations for them. With [[Gordon J. F. MacDonald]], Munk published ''The Rotation of the Earth: A Geophysical Discussion'' in 1960. This book discusses the effects from a geophysical, rather than astronomical, perspective. It shows that short-term variations are caused by movement in the atmosphere, ocean, underground water, and interior of the Earth, including [[tide]]s in the ocean and solid Earth. Over longer times (a century or more), the largest influence is the [[tidal acceleration]] that causes the Moon to move away from the Earth at about four centimeters per year. This gradually slows Earth's rotation, so that over 500 million years the length of day has increased from 21 hours to 24.<ref name=CrafoordInfo/> The monograph remains a standard reference.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Groves|first1=G.W. |editor1-last=Kopal |editor1-first=Zden\u011bk |title=Physics and Astronomy of the Moon|publisher=Academic Press|date=1961|chapter=Dynamics of the Earth-Moon System|pages=61\u201398|location=New York|isbn=9781483270784}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Phil.

The Moon does not have a molten liquid core, so cannot rotate through the egg-shaped distortion caused by the Earth's gravitational pull. Rotation through this shape requires internal shearing, and only fluids are capable of such rotation with small frictional losses.

For these achievements. Munk received a number of prestigious awards including the [[National Medal of Science]], the [[Kyoto Prize]], and induction to the French [[Legion of Honour]].\n\nMunk worked on a wide range of topics, including [[Surface wave|surface waves]], geophysical implications of [[Milankovitch cycles|variations in the Earth's rotation]], [[tide]]s, [[internal wave]]s, deep-ocean drilling into the sea floor, acoustical measurements of ocean properties, [[sea level rise]], and [[Global warming|climate change]]. Beginning in 1975, Munk and [[Carl Wunsch]] developed [[ocean acoustic tomography]], to exploit the ease with which sound travels in the ocean and use acoustical signals for measurement of broad-scale temperature and current. In a 1991 experiment, Munk and his collaborators investigated the ability of underwater sound to propagate from the Southern Indian Ocean across all ocean basins. The aim was to measure global ocean temperature. The experiment was criticized by environmental groups, who expected that the loud acoustic signals would adversely affect marine life. Munk continued to develop and advocate for acoustical measurements of the ocean throughout his career.\n\nMunk's career was long and complicated. World War II disrupted his doctoral studies at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] (Scripps), and led to his participation in U.S. military research efforts.  Munk and his doctoral advisor [[Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)|Harald Sverdrup]] developed methods for forecasting wave conditions which were used in support of beach landings in all theaters of the war.  He was involved with oceanographic programs during the [[Operation Crossroads|atomic bomb tests in Bikini Atoll]].

The latter gives rise to a small tide called the [[Long period tide#Pole tide|pole tide]]. Although the scientific community knew of these fluctuations, they did not have adequate explanations for them. With [[Gordon J. F. MacDonald]], Munk published ''The Rotation of the Earth: A Geophysical Discussion'' in 1960. This book discusses the effects from a geophysical, rather than astronomical, perspective. It shows that short-term variations are caused by movement in the atmosphere, ocean, underground water, and interior of the Earth, including [[tide]]s in the ocean and solid Earth. Over longer times (a century or more), the largest influence is the [[tidal acceleration]] that causes the Moon to move away from the Earth at about four centimeters per year. This gradually slows Earth's rotation, so that over 500 million years the length of day has increased from 21 hours to 24.<ref name=CrafoordInfo/> The monograph remains a standard reference.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Groves|first1=G.W. |editor1-last=Kopal |editor1-first=Zden\u011bk |title=Physics and Astronomy of the Moon|publisher=Academic Press|date=1961|chapter=Dynamics of the Earth-Moon System|pages=61\u201398|location=New York|isbn=9781483270784}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Phil.

The Moon does not have a molten liquid core, so cannot rotate through the egg-shaped distortion caused by the Earth's gravitational pull. Rotation through this shape requires internal shearing, and only fluids are capable of such rotation with small frictional losses. Thus, the pointy end of the \"egg\" is gravitationally locked to always point directly towards the Earth, with some small [[Libration|''librations'']], or wobbles. Large objects may strike the Moon from time to time, causing it to rotate about some axis, but it will quickly stop rotating.

He was a councillor to King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] and was rewarded for his services, becoming a leading member of the [[East Anglia]]n [[nobility]]. Beaumont held numerous offices for the crown, and was promoted up the [[peerage]] to become the first man with the rank of [[viscount]]. He also amassed immense personal wealth, acquired through inheritance, marriage, and royal patronage.\n\nBeaumont was present for some of the most notable events of Henry VI's reign. He was present at the arrest of [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester|Humphrey, duke of Gloucester]] in 1447, helped defend the king against [[Jack Cade's Rebellion]] in 1450, and helped suppress the rebellion of [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, duke of York]] in 1452. While York and his allies ended up fighting against the king, Beaumont remained loyal to the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] crown during the 1450s, which saw the beginning of the [[Wars of the Roses]]. His personal loyalty to Henry VI eventually cost him his life \u2013 he was killed, bodyguarding the king, at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|battle of Northampton]] in 1460. Beaumont's son, [[William Beaumont, 2nd Viscount Beaumont|William Beaumont]], continued the struggle against the [[House of York|Yorkists]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn at [[Folkingham|Folkingham Castle]], the eldest son of Henry Beaumont, 5th Baron Beaumont,<ref name=\"oxforddnb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50239|title=John Beaumont|publisher=oxforddnb.com|accessdate=14 September 2015|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/50239|year=2004}}{{subscription required}}</ref> and orphaned by the age of four,<ref name=\"auto\">Cockayne, G.E., ''The Complete Peerage'' II, ed.

He was a councillor to King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] and was rewarded for his services, becoming a leading member of the [[East Anglia]]n [[nobility]]. Beaumont held numerous offices for the crown, and was promoted up the [[peerage]] to become the first man with the rank of [[viscount]]. He also amassed immense personal wealth, acquired through inheritance, marriage, and royal patronage.\n\nBeaumont was present for some of the most notable events of Henry VI's reign. He was present at the arrest of [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester|Humphrey, duke of Gloucester]] in 1447, helped defend the king against [[Jack Cade's Rebellion]] in 1450, and helped suppress the rebellion of [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, duke of York]] in 1452. While York and his allies ended up fighting against the king, Beaumont remained loyal to the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] crown during the 1450s, which saw the beginning of the [[Wars of the Roses]]. His personal loyalty to Henry VI eventually cost him his life \u2013 he was killed, bodyguarding the king, at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|battle of Northampton]] in 1460.

She brought him further territorial and financial augmentation.<ref name=\"oxforddnb\"/>\n\n==Political career==\nBeaumont was fully involved in the political crises that punctuated the reign of Henry VI: Griffiths has labelled him one of 'a small group of like-minded men, led by Suffolk' who could work for the king whether in council or on [[royal progress]],<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 282</ref> although his attendance at council seems to have become more sporadic by 1443.<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 292 n. 30</ref> As [[Lord Steward|Steward of England]],<ref>Harriss, G.L., ''Shaping the Nation: England 1360\u20131461'' (Oxford, 2005), p. 613</ref> he personally- although accompanied by, for example, other lords such as [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]] and the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|earl of Salisbury]]<ref>Jacob, E.F., The Fifteenth Century, (Oxford, 1993), 483</ref>- arrested [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester|Humphrey, duke of Gloucester]] for [[treason]], in [[Bury St Edmunds]] 18 February 1447.<ref name=\"Goodwin2011\">{{cite book|author=George Goodwin|title=Fatal Colours: Towton, 1461 \u2013 England's Most Brutal Battle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9EGec-o2joC|date=10 March 2011|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-0-297-86072-3|page=30}}</ref>\nThroughout the subsequent period of foreign catastrophe which, to contemporaries, came to symbolise the failure of [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Suffolk's]] government in the late 1440s, Beaumont not only supported the duke's policy but backed him during his [[impeachment]].<ref>Harriss, G.L., ''Shaping the Nation: England 1360\u20131461'' (Oxford, 2005), p. 611</ref> With Suffolk's fall in 1450, it has been described as 'rather surprising' that Beaumont did not fall with him, having 'been involved in some of the regime's most unpopular activities.'<ref name=\"oxforddnb\"/> For instance, he was a close associate and a 'protector'<ref>Jacob, E.F., The Fifteenth Century, (Oxford, 1993), 494</ref> of the 'headstrong' Sir [[William Tailboys]] (whom Griffiths also called '[[wikt:knave|knave]]-in-chief')<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 580</ref> when Tailboys attempted to assassinate [[Ralph de Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell|Lord Cromwell]] in broad daylight in November 1449.<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 286</ref> He had also suffered a minor assault on his [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]] [[manor]] the previous year, but it is likely that he was seen as more impartial at the time than he has seen since.<ref name=\"oxforddnb\"/> Indeed, far from suffering from his patron's fall, he was appointed to Suffolk's old position of [[Lord Chamberlain]] of England, although only for three weeks.<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 288</ref>\n\nAt the outbreak of [[Jack Cade's Rebellion]], he was commissioned on 10 June 1450 to reinforce [[London]],<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 611</ref> and accompanied Henry VI back to the capital in July.<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 623</ref> Later, with the [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham|duke of Buckingham]] negotiated with the rebels at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], offering them [[royal pardons]].<ref>Harriss, G.L., ''Shaping the Nation: England 1360\u20131461'' (Oxford, 2005), p. 620</ref>\n\nAt the time of the [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|duke of Suffolk]]'s murder, Beaumont had been an associate of the by now recalcitrant [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, duke of York]], having been one of the duke's [[feoffee]]s in May 1436 and March 1441,<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 701 n. 15</ref> and possibly even acting as the duke's councillor on occasion.<ref name=\"oxforddnb\"/> He had also joined York on the king's council during York's first [[Protectorate]] (March 1453 \u2013 January 1454).<ref>Harriss, G.L., ''Shaping the Nation: England 1360\u20131461'' (Oxford, 2005), p. 629</ref> But as York drew further from the court, so Beaumont appears to have moved towards it; although he appears to have not been present at the [[first battle of St Albans]] in 1455,<ref name=\"oxforddnb\"/> he had already stood with the king against York at the latter's [[Impasse|stand-off]] with king at [[Dartford]] in 1452,<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 709 n. 134</ref> and then sat in judgment on some of his men. He eventually joined the anti-Neville faction at court; although his wife was a [[House of Neville|Neville]], her family had by now [[Wars of the Roses|aligned themselves with the duke of York]]. He was amongst the party of lords that reported to parliament that the king was sick and they 'coud not rouse him' in March 1454.<ref>Goodwin, pages 51\u201352</ref> He was also an arbitrator between York and the king's party, headed by the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|duke of Somerset]] after the king's recovery in 1454; although Griffiths says not a 'strictly impartial' one.<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 739</ref> Indeed, Griffiths suggests that his appointment to the council on 15 April 1454, after the king's recovery and York's dismissal, was part of a concerted attempt to 're-balance' the council after the protectorate.<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 727, 762 n. 70</ref> He was even reported (although wrongly) to have been recruiting an army to march against London in 1454.<ref>Jacob, E.F., The Fifteenth Century, (Oxford, 1993), 508.</ref> He was one of the few [[Lords Temporal]] to remain in Henry VI's council in the closing years of the decade, by which time he was the queen's chief steward.<ref>Jacob, E.F., ''The Fifteenth Century'', (Oxford, 1993), 481.</ref> He was also part of the [[royal commission]] set up by parliament in July 1455 to examine royal household expenditure;<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 750, 769 n. 192</ref> the trust the Queen placed in him was demonstrated on 28 January 1457 when he was appointed to the council of the young [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]],<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 781</ref> which had responsibility for his estate management, expenditure, personnel, and administration.<ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 781\u20132</ref>\n\nHis loyalty the crown was such that in 1460 the [[House of York|Yorkists]] proclaimed him one of their most mortal enemies among the king's supporters.<ref>Goodwin, page 105</ref> They also claimed that Beaumont, along with the earls of [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|Wiltshire]] and [[John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury|Shrewsbury]], orchestrated the Yorkists' [[attainder]] at the 1459 [[Parliament of Devils|Coventry parliament]], in order to seize the Yorkists' lands.<ref>Lander, J.R., ''Government and Community, 1450\u20131509'' (London, 1980), p. 205</ref> It is likely that they were the public focus of the Yorkists' enmity in a way that Henry VI's queen (to whom he was a personal adviser), [[Margaret of Anjou]] could not be.<ref>Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'' (London, 2010), p. 142</ref><ref>Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'' (Berkeley, 1981), p. 262</ref>\n\n==Wealth and estates==\n[[File:Map for Battle of Northampton by Ramsay.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the Battle of Northampton]]\nIn 1444, further expanding his wealth, he bought the [[reversion (law)|reversion]] of Sir Thomas Erdington's estates, as the latter was dying with no heir.<ref>Harriss, G.L., ''Shaping the Nation: England 1360\u20131461'' (Oxford, 2005), p. 148</ref> Like other lords involved in the fall of Gloucester in 1447, he benefitted immensely from the subsequent redistribution of the duke's lands.<ref>Harriss, G.L., ''Shaping the Nation: England 1360\u20131461'' (Oxford, 2005), p. 615</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nHis allegiance to the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] regime remained strong enough for him to take arms against the [[House of York]], and eventually cost him his life.

In 2000 after being fired from id Software he went to work for Wild Tangent making several dancing girl visualizers for Winamp and a third-person shooter called ''Betty Bad'' (an homage to Steed's favorite arcade game, ''[[Tempest (arcade game)|Tempest]]'').\n\nSteed gained press and controversy with the release of a \"Crackwhore\" female model for ''[[Quake II]]'' in response to a skin (character texture) contest for the first ''Quake'' sponsored by a group of female gamers who called themselves the \"Crackwhore Clan\". The Crackwhore model was released after ''Quake II'' was released as a downloadable character as an homage to that same female gamer clan.

Nf3/4...e6|e6]]\nThe position may readily be reached by a number of different {{chessgloss|move order|move orders}}. With Black advancing pawns to both e6 and c6, the opening resembles a mixture of the Orthodox [[Queen's Gambit Declined]] (QGD) and the [[Slav Defense]].\n\nBlack is threatening to capture the white [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] on c4, and hold it with b7\u2013b5. White can avoid this in a number of ways. About 80% of games continue '''5.Bg5''' or '''5.e3''': the former constitutes a sharp pawn sacrifice, while the latter restricts the dark-squared bishop from its natural development to g5. Other possible moves are '''5.Qb3''', '''5.g3''' and '''5.cxd5''', the last of which, after 5...exd5, leads to a line of the QGD Exchange Variation where White's early Nf3 enables Black's queen bishop to freely develop, which should give equality (''ECO'' codes D43 and D45). It is worth noting that '''5.Bf4''' is considered somewhat inaccurate, as '''5...dxc4''' is favorable for black. \n\nFor the Semi-Slav the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]]'' designates codes D43 through D49.\n{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}\n\n== First moves and possible deviations ==\nIt is possible to reach the Semi-Slav through many move orders. White player may start the game with either 1.d4, 1.Nf3 or even 1.c4, keeping the possibility of a Semi-Slav open. Black player can choose different combinations of d5, c6, e6 and Nf6 as well in order to avoid certain variations or to open up some new opportunities of his own.\n\nThis chapter looks at the first moves of the game from Black player's point of view, assuming that he would prefer to play the Semi-Slav.\n\n=== 1. d4 d5 move order ===\nIf White opens the game with '''1. d4''', Black is happy to respond with '''1...d5''' when aiming for a Semi-Slav. Of course White can continue the game with 2. Bf4 or even 2. Bg5 (as is the case if Black opens 1...Nf6), and the game will take a completely different path. In vast majority of the games, however, White players choose to play either '''2. c4''' (Queens Gambit) or '''2. Nf3'''. After '''2. Nf3''', the natural continuation for Black is '''2...Nf6.''' Playing 2...c6 or 2...e6 might be somewhat inaccurate, since White always has the option of avoiding c2-c4, so developing the knight first makes a lot of sense.\n\nIf White chooses the most common '''2. c4''', Black has three practical choices: either protect the pawn on d5 by playing e6 or c6 (keeping the option of a Semi-Slav open), or alternatively capture the white pawn with dxc4 (leading to Queen's Gambit Accepted). The first thing for Black players to consider is, what if White captures on d5 anyhow with cxd5. If Black has played the Slav move order (2...c6), then after the recapture cxd5 (\"exchange Slav\") the pawn structure is symmetrical. Should Black have played 2...e6 instead, the recapture exd5 leads to an imbalanced pawn structure called the Carlsbad structure, which might offer White some opportunities for a minority attack on the queenside.\n\n==== Slav move order: 2...c6 ====\nProtecting the d5-pawn with the c-pawn has at least three implications for Black. First, it allows Black to keep the option to enter the Slav defence, i.e., developing his light-squared bishop to f5 at the appropriate moment, before moving his e-pawn. Second, it may discourage White from capturing on d5, given the somewhat drawish reputation of the Exchange Slav. Third, it prevents White from entering the Catalan opening with 3. g3.\n\nOne drawback of playing '''2...c6''' is that White may continue '''3. Nf3''', and after '''3...Nf6''' play '''4.e3''' (\"Slow Slav\"), and now Black cannot really play the Semi-Slav since 4...e6 is considered to be good for White as he has not committed to Nc3 thus having other options to develop, like Nbd2 or b3 for instance.\n\n==== Queen's Gambit declined move order: 2...e6 ====\nProtecting the d5-pawn with the e-pawn allows Black to develop his kingside more rapidly, but it does block the light-squared bishop for the time being. After 3. Nf3 Nf6 White has the option of entering the Catalan opening with 4. g3.\n\nIf White continues '''3. Nc3''', Black has two options to proceed with a Semi-Slav in mind. First, Black can play '''3...c6''' (the \"triangle setup\", see below). Second, Black can play '''3...Nf6''', which gives White the opportunity to continue '''4. cxd5 exd5''' followed by '''5. Bg5'''.\n\n=== The triangle setup ===\n{{Chess diagram small\n |tright\n |The Triangle setup\n |rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n |pd|pd|  |  |  |pd|pd|pd\n |  |  |pd|  |pd|  |  |  \n |  |  |  |pd|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |pl|pl|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |nl|  |  |  |  |  \n |pl|pl|  |  |pl|pl|pl|pl\n |rl|  |bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl  \n |Position after 3...e6\n}}After the move order '''1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3''' black has the opportunity to respond with '''3...e6''' instead of 3...Nf6. This \"triangle setup\" opens up some new alternatives for both players on the fourth move. \n\n==== Marshall Gambit ====\nFirst, White has the opportunity to enter the '''Marshall Gambit''' by playing '''4. e4'''. Play continues '''4...dxe4''' (4...Bb4 is sometimes played, but should favor White) '''5. Nxe4 Bb4+'''. Now White has two alternative paths to continue. The main line is considered to be '''6. Bd2 Qxd4 7. Bxb4 Qxe4+''' and then White blocks the check with either his knight or bishop. Alternatively White can continue with '''6. Nc3''' (as in World Championship match Carlsen-Anand, 2013), and play continues '''6...c5 7.a3 Ba5.''' \n\n==== Noteboom variation ====\nSecond, if White continues '''4. Nf3''', Black has the extra option of playing '''4...dxc4''' entering the '''Noteboom variation'''. If White wants to avoid this variation, he must play either 4. e4 (Marshall Gambit) or 4. e3 (which usually transposes to the Meran, but deprives White of the Bg5 variations). White now has a number of possible continuations, including '''5. a4''' (see below), '''5. e3''' (often transposing to the line given below), '''5. e4''' (with similarities to the line given below), or even '''5. Bg5'''. A typical line in the Noteboom variation continues: '''5. a4 Bb4 6. e3 b5 7. Bd2 a5 8. axb5 Bxc3 9. Bxc3 cxb5 10. b3 Bb7 11. bxc4 b4 12. Bb2 Nf6 13. Bd3 Nbd7 14. 0-0 0-0''' with an interesting position where Black has two connected passed pawns on the queenside, while White has the bishop pair and dominates the center of the board. \n\nIt is worth noting, that the \"triangle setup\" is not ideal for Black if White plays '''3. Nf3''' instead of 3. Nc3. Should Black play '''3...e6''' nevertheless, White has the option of continuing with '''4. e3''' or '''4. Qc2''', for example, thus avoiding the Noteboom variation. \n\n=== 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 move order ===\nBlack has the option of delaying the move d7-d5, for instance to avoid the exchange cxd5. If White continues '''3. Nc3''', Black has the option of transposing to a Nimzo-Indian with '''3...Bb4'''. Should White choose to play '''3. Nf3''' instead, Black can simply play '''3...d5''', and then after '''4. Nc3 c6''' we are back at the start of Semi-Slav. This move order, however, allows white to play the Catalan Opening with either '''3. g3''', or alternatively '''3. Nf3 d5 4. g3'''. \n\n== Semi-Slav: 5.e3 variations ==\nRoughly 50% of the games continue with '''5.e3'''. White gives priority to developing his light-squared bishop, and accepts that for the time being the dark-squared bishop will remain somewhat out of play. The main line continues with '''5...Nbd7'''. The bishop moves 5...Bd6 and 5...Be7 are seldom seen, as masters realized early on that at e7, the bishop was passively placed and does nothing to further one of Black's aims, the freeing move ...e5. The unusual move 5...a6 is considered solid for Black. Some sources call 5...a6 the \"accelerated Meran\".<ref>https://www.365chess.com/eco/D45_Queen's_Gambit_Declined_semi-Slav_accelerated_Meran_(Alekhine_variation)</ref>\n\n===Meran Variation: 6.Bd3 {{anchor|Meran Variation}}===\n{{Chess diagram small\n |tright\n |\n |rd|  |bd|qd|kd|bd|  |rd\n |pd|pd|  |nd|  |pd|pd|pd\n |  |  |pd|  |pd|nd|  |  \n |  |  |  |pd|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |pl|pl|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |nl|bl|pl|nl|  |  \n |pl|pl|  |  |  |pl|pl|pl\n |rl|  |bl|ql|kl|  |  |rl  \n |Position after 6. Bd3\n}}One of the main variations of the Semi-Slav is the Meran Variation. White plays '''6. Bd3''', provoking the continuation '''6... dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5''' (''ECO'' codes D46 to D49) where black surrenders his center in exchange for queenside expansion and some tempi against the white bishop. The line was first played in 1906 in the game Schlechter\u2013Perlis.<ref>http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessopening?eco=D48</ref> The variation takes its name from the town of Meran ([[Merano]]) in northern Italy. During a 1924 tournament in Meran, it was used successfully in the game [[Ernst Gruenfeld|Gruenfeld]]\u2013[[Akiba Rubinstein|Rubinstein]]. Gruenfeld adopted the same variation two rounds later against [[Rudolf Spielmann|Spielmann]], winning as well.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/crosswords/chess/29chess.html \"An Opening Created in 1924 Still Leads to Complex Battles\"] ''New York Times '', 29 January 2006</ref> White will play in the center, leading to a rich, complicated game. These opposing strategies, with the ensuing keen play, have long made the Meran a favorite for enterprising players of either color. An example is Gligoric v Ljubojevic, Belgrade, 1979.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1091735 Gligoric v Ljubojevic, Belgrade, 1979]</ref>\n\nThough appearing in contemporary master play with less frequency than the Meran, there are other possibilities: '''6...Be7''', '''6...Bb4''', introduced by the Italian master [[Max Romih]], and '''6...Bd6''', which was much the most popular line before the debut of the Meran, and espoused by the American [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[Arthur Bisguier]] throughout his career.\n\nAfter the main line '''6. Bd3 dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5''' white has three alternative retreats for the bishop. Vast majority of games continue '''8. Bd3''', but the moves '''8. Bb3''' and '''8. Be2''' are possible as well.\n\n==== 8. Bd3 variation (main line) ====\nBy playing '''8. Bd3''' white returns the bishop on this ideal square, where it supports white's strategic ambition of pushing e3-e4 in the near future, and gives White the option of playing Ne4 if necessary. Black's main plan, on the other hand, is to find a way to push c6-c5 in order to free the long diagonal for his light-squared bishop and to get rid of the backward pawn on the semi-open c-file. In practice, black has three alternative moves in this position: '''8...a6''' (Classical Meran), '''8...Bb7''' (\"Modern/Improved Meran\"<ref>http://www.chess.com/article/view/larsenrsquos-improved-meran-the-great-dane-deigns-to-allow-check</ref>) or '''8. Bd6''' (which often transposes to the lines of Anti-Meran).\n\n==== 8. Bb3 variation ====\nMaintaining the bishop on the long diagonal aiming at e6 and f7 squares is an aggressive approach by white. If black is not careful, white will launch an aggressive attack towards the black king with possible knight sacrifices on e6 or f7 in the near future. An example continuation might be '''8...b4 9. Ne2 Bb7 10. Nf4 Bd6 11. Ng5''', when white is already threatening sacrifices to open up black's position, and black must respond with '''11...Bxf4''' in order not to end up in trouble.\n\n==== 8. Be2 variation ====\nRetreating the bishop to e2 instead of the typical d3-square has an impact on certain continuations, when the white queen is protecting the d-pawn. An example can be seen in a line where black plays in the typical Meran style: '''8. Be2 a6 9. e4 c5 10. e5 cxd4''' and now white has the option of playing '''11. Qxd4 Bc5  12. Qf4'''  with a comfortable advantage.\n\n<br />\n=== Classical Meran: 8...a6 ===\n{{Chess diagram small\n |tright\n |Classical Meran\n |rd|  |bd|qd|kd|bd|  |rd\n |  |  |  |nd|  |pd|pd|pd\n |pd|  |pd|  |pd|nd|  |  \n |  |pd|  |  |  |  |  |  \n |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |nl|bl|pl|nl|  |  \n |pl|pl|  |  |  |pl|pl|pl\n |rl|  |bl|ql|kl|  |  |rl  \n |Position after 8...a6\n}}\nBlack plays the move '''8...a6''' in order to protect his b5-pawn and threatening to follow up with the equalizing move c6-c5. White cannot really prevent this plan directly, so he must immediately generate some counterplay in the center with '''9. e4'''. It is possible to play also 9. a4, but the move 9.0-0 is a strategic mistake as it allows black to freely push his c-pawn which equalizes the game immediately. Black will respond with '''9...c5''', after which White has the choice between pushing his d-pawn or e-pawn, leading to very different middlegames.<br />\n\n==== 10. e5 variation (main line) ====\nPushing the e-pawn is the classical approach by white, adopted in several high level games, including World Championship match Kramnink-Anand in 2008. The black knight on f6 has no reasonable squares to go to, so black must continue his aggression by '''10...cxd4''', attacking the white knight in return. Taking the knight on f6 would favor black, so White responds '''11. Nxb5''', sacrificing his knight while still threatening Black's f6-knight. Black now has three reasonable alternatives how to proceed. Most popular and tested line continues '''11...axb5 12. exf6 gxf6 13. 0-0 Qb6 14. Qe2''' with a very interesting position. Black is up a pawn and has a very straightforward plan: play Bb7, Bd6 Rb8 and aim for the white king. Practice has shown, however, that white is doing very well in these positions, but precision is certainly required from both sides. Alternatively, Black can play '''11...Ng4''', where White might respond '''12. Qa4''', preventing the capture axb5 due to the pin on the a-file, as well as discouraging Black from capturing on e5 due to the discovered check on the black king. Nevertheless, play might continue '''12...Ngxe5 13. Nxe5 Nxe5 14. Nd6+ Ke7 15. Nxc8+ Rxc8 16. Bxa6 Ra8''' and white is clearly better but certainly not yet winning. A third alternative is to play '''11...Nxe5''', and after '''12. Nxe5 axb5 13. Bxb5+ Bd7 14. Nxd7 Qa5+ 15. Bd2 Qxb5 16. Nxf8 Kxf8''' White probably has a slight advantage but the imbalance in pawn structures will guarantee an exciting game with opportunities for both sides.\n\n==== 10. d5 variation (transposition to Reynolds Attack) ====\nWhite has the option of playing '''10. d5''' as well. This often transposes to the so called \"Reynolds attack\" (described in detail below) after, for example, the moves '''10...c4 11. Bc2 Qc7 12. 0-0 Bb7''', or some other move order.\n\n<br />\n=== Modern/Improved Meran: 8...Bb7 ===\n{{Chess diagram small\n |tright\n |Modern/Improved Meran\n |rd|  |  |qd|kd|bd|  |rd\n |pd|bd|  |nd|  |pd|pd|pd\n |  |  |pd|  |pd|nd|  |  \n |  |pd|  |  |  |  |  |  \n |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |nl|bl|pl|nl|  |  \n |pl|pl|  |  |  |pl|pl|pl\n |rl|  |bl|ql|kl|  |  |rl  \n |Position after 8...Bb7\n}}According to some sources, the move was first played in 1923. The strategic idea behind this move is to develop the light-squared bishop and possibly play b5-b4 and c6-c5 without wasting time on a7-a6. The move '''8...Bb7''' was long considered virtually unplayable due to the line '''9. e4 b4 10. Na4 c5 11. e5 Nd5 12. Nxc5 Nxc5 13. dxc5 Bxc5 14. Bb5+''' and the black king will be stuck in the center. However, it was later found, in particular through the work of Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen in late 1960's and early 1970's, that after '''14. Ke7''' black is completely fine and might be even better, with a very strong knight on d5 and strong bishops aiming at the white kingside. This forced white players to look for alternative approaches to black's modern treatment of the Meran.{{clear}}\n\n\n\n\n==== 9. 0-0 variation and Reynolds Attack ====\n{{Chess diagram small\n |tright\n |Reynolds Attack\n |rd|  |  |qd|kd|bd|  |rd\n |  |bd|  |nd|  |pd|pd|pd\n |pd|  |  |  |pd|nd|  |  \n |  |pd|pd|pl|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  \n |  |  |nl|bl|  |nl|  |  \n |pl|pl|  |  |  |pl|pl|pl\n |rl|  |bl|ql|  |rl|kl|    \n |Position after 11. d5\n}}\nWhite can simply play '''9. 0-0''', and the game often continues '''9...a6 10. e4 c5 11.d5''' leading into the so called \"Reynolds Attack\". It is worth noting that 11.e5 is no longer an option as it was in the Classical Meran, since black can respond with 11...cxd4 and now 12. Nxb5 no longer works since black has the option of playing 12...Bxf3 13. Qxf3 Nd5 and the game is very much equal. After '''11. d5''' black cannot really capture on d5, since the opening of the e-file could be disastrous for black in a practical game (although with precise computer play black seems to be fine after 11...exd5). Therefore black must allow white to capture on e6, and try to deal with the consequences.  \n\nBlack's typically develops his queen with Qc7, and he has a choice of whether or not to push the c-pawn to c4. The benefit of pushing the c-pawn is that should white capture play dxe6 and after the recapture fxe6 attack the e-pawn with either Ng5 or Nd4, black has the opportunity to defend the pawn with Nc5. Alternatively black can refrain from pushing the c-pawn to c4, which prevents white from using the d4-square for his knight in some variations. \n\nAn example variation where black keeps his c-pawn on c5 goes like this: '''11...Qc7 12. dxe6 fxe6 13. Ng5 Qc6''' after which there are many different ways to continue for both sides. \n\nIf Black instead pushes his c-pawn, this opens up several interesting opportunities for white. For example: '''11...c4 12. Bc2 Qc7 13. dxe6 fxe6''' and now White has two possible knight moves (among other alternatives) to put pressure on the black e-pawn. \n\nFirst, '''14. Ng5''' has to be met with '''14...Nc5''' (now 14...Qc6 would lead to 15. Qf3 h6 16. Qh3 - a typical queen maneuver in such positions - with a very strong advantage for White). Now White has a couple of interesting alternatives to proceed. First one is a flashy move '''15. e5''', played for example in 1994 by Kramnik against Shirov, and a couple of rounds later by Karpov against Kramnik himself. Play continues '''15...Qxe5 16. Re1 Qd6 17. Qxd6 Bxd6 18. Be3 0-0 19. Rad1 Be7 20. Bxc5 Bxc5 21. Nxe6 Rfc8''' with roughly equal chances for both. An alternative approach is to play '''15. Be3 h6''', after which White can throw in the even more flashy knight sacrifice '''16. Nxe6''', and the game typically continues '''16...Nxe6 17.e5 Qxe5 18. Bg6+''' (the point!) '''Ke7 19. Re1''' and White has a strong attack against the black king, despite being a full piece down. \n\nSecond, '''14. Nd4 Nc5 15. Qe2 Bd6''' leads to very interesting play, like for example in a game Karpov-Anand, 1998, where the game continued '''16. f4 e5 17. Ndxb5 axb5 18. Nxb5 Qb6 19. Nxd6+ Qxd6 20. fxe5 Qxe5 21. Rf5 Qe7 22. Qxc4 Rc8 23. Qb5+ Ncd7 24. Qxb7 Rxc2''' with a wild and tactical game. \n\nA lot of theory and high-level games exist on Reynolds Attack and it's different subvariations. As in many variations of the Semi-Slav, the game gets wildly tactical and provides opportunities for both sides. \n==== 9. e4 variation ====\nContinuing the game with '''9. e4 b4 10. Na4 c5 11. e5 Nd5''' is still very much an option for white. Instead of captures on c5, white can play '''12. 0-0''' with some attacking prospects. The most critical continuation is '''12...cxd4''', after which white can either play '''13. Re1''' or '''13. Nxd4''', both giving opportunity for some wild attacks on the black position. With accurate play, however, black should be fine.\n\n==== 9. a3 variation ====\nWhite has a third option to play '''9. a3''' as well. The idea is to prepare b2-b4 by white, which would make it more difficult for black to achieve his strategic plan of pushing c6-c5. Black may respond with moves like '''9...b4''', '''9...Bd6''', '''9...a6''' or '''9...a5'''.\n\n=== 8...Bd6 variation ===\nIntent of the move '''8...Bd6''' is to allow rapid castling as well as to increase black's control over the e5-square, which will be critical in many continuations. White's strategic idea in the Meran is to push e3-e4, and with a bishop on d6 Black is always ready to meet this with e6-e5, and typically Black is doing fine after such moves. Play might continue '''9. 0-0 0-0 10. Qc2 Bb7''' transposing to one of the topical lines discussed in the Anti-Meran section below. In addition there are some independent lines after 8...Bd6, where play continues with, for example, either '''9. Ng5 Bb7 10. Qf3 h6 11. Qh3'''  or '''9. Bd2 Bb7 10. Rc1 Rc8 11. a3'''.<br />\n<br />\n===Anti-Meran Variation: 6.Qc2 {{anchor|Anti-Meran Variation}}===\nThe main alternative to 6.Bd3 has become '''6.Qc2''', once a sideline, this move exploded in popularity in the 1990s, in large part due to [[Anatoly Karpov]]'s advocacy. The idea is to wait for Black to commit to ...dxc4 before playing Bd3. Black commonly replies with '''6...Bd6''' and now White can choose between a couple of very different continuations:\n\n====Karpov Variation: 7.Bd3 {{anchor|Karpov Variation}}====\nMost often white players choose the move '''7. Bd3'''. Karpov first played 7.Be2 but it soon transpired that the d3-square gives White better chances. Play usually continues '''7...dxc4 8. Bxc4 0-0 9. 0-0 b5 10. Bd3 Bb7''', after which white has several interesting options to continue the game.\n\n===== 11. a3 variation =====\n{{Chess diagram small\n |tright\n |\n |rd|  |  |qd|  |rd|kd|\n |pd|bd|  |nd|  |pd|pd|pd\n |  |  |pd|bd|pd|nd|  |  \n |  |pd|  |  |  |  |  |  \n |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  |  \n |pl|  |nl|bl|pl|nl|  |  \n |  |pl|ql|  |  |pl|pl|pl\n |rl|  |bl|  |  |rl|kl|  \n |Position after 11.a3\n}}\nOne of the \"hot\" positions of Semi-Slav occurs after '''11. a3'''. White intends to simply push b2-b4, which would seriously hamper black's strategic plan of playing c6-c5. White also often looks at transferring his knight from f3 via g5 to e4, which is something black might want to prevent. Black players have tried various approaches to combat white's plan, and the final word on this variation has certainly not been said yet.\n\nIf black responds with '''11...a5''', he is certainly slowing down white's intentions towards b4, but the cost may be too high: black will never be able to support his b-pawn with a6, and the weakness of the queenside pawn structure will be a permanent problem for black.\n\nAn alternative is to play '''11...a6''' aiming at pushing c5 next, which more or less invites white to play '''12. b4'''. Now black can respond with '''12...a5''', and the game could continue with '''13. Rb1 axb4 14. axb4 Qe7 15. e4 e5''' with very dynamic play and opportunities for both sides.\n\nPlaying '''11...Qe7''' takes the poison out of white's planned knight transfer, since after the moves '''12. Ng5 h6 13. Nge4 Nxe4 14. Nxe4 c5''' black seems to be fine. However, after '''11...Qe7''', white can continue '''12. e4 e5 13. Bg5''' and white seems to retain some advantage.\n\nA very radical approach by black is to play '''11...Rc8''', with a clear threat of placing the rook on the same file as the white queen. If white now plays '''12. b4''' to \"prevent\" black from pushing the c-pawn, black may simply respond with '''12...c5!?''' (12...a5 is the computer preference), and after '''13. bxc5 Bxf3 14. cxd6 Nd5''' the game is wide open with massive tactical complications and opportunities for both sides.\n\n===== 11. Rd1 variation =====\nPlaying '''11. Rd1''' is a possibility, but it looks like black can neutralize white's play after '''11...b4 12. Na4 c5 13. dxc5 Rc8''' and the tactics seem to work in black's favor.\n\n===== 11. e4 variation =====\nWhite can immediately push '''11.e4''', and black must respond with the thematic '''11...e5'''. Play often continues '''12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Nxe5 Bxe5  14. h3''' with some slight advantage for white.\n\n===== 11. Ng5 variation =====\nWhite can begin the thematic knight transfer immediately with '''11. Ng5'''. In such positions, black often has the tactical idea of Bxh2+ Kxh2 Ng4+ at his disposal, but in this precise variation it does not seem to provide anything for black. After '''11...h6 12. Nge4 Be7''' the position seems very equal, though. \n\n==== 7. b3 variation ====\nInstead of preparing the e3-e4 push to free his dark-squared bishop, white can also play '''7. b3''' to support the pawn on c4 and develop the bishop on the long diagonal in anticipation of future opening of the center. Play might continue '''7...0-0 8. Be2''' after which black has several viable continuations at his disposal.\n\n====Shirov\u2013Shabalov Gambit: 7.g4 {{anchor|Shirov\u2013Shabalov Gambit}}====\n{{Chess diagram small\n |tright\n |\n |rd|  |bd|qd|kd|  |  |rd\n |pd|pd|  |nd|  |pd|pd|pd\n |  |  |pd|bd|pd|nd|  |  \n |  |  |  |pd|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |pl|pl|  |  |pl|  \n |  |  |nl|  |pl|nl|  |  \n |pl|pl|ql|  |  |pl|  |pl\n |rl|  |bl|  |kl|bl|  |rl\n |Position after 7.g4\n}}\nAnother increasingly common gambit line used in the Anti-Meran is the sharp 7.g4.

Rg1'''. Black now has a number of playable continuations, including Qf6, Nxh2, f5, h5 and Nh6, and with precise play black should be fine.\n\nAn alternative to taking the pawn is to simply stop it by playing '''7...h6'''. White will continue with '''8. Rg1''' anyhow, but black has a number of playable responses.\n\nAnother popular response is to play '''7...dxc4''', but after '''8. Bxc4''' it seems that white will retain a slight advantage. Play might continue, for example, with '''8...e5 9. g5 Nd5 10.

White refuses to shut in the dark-squared bishop, instead developing it to an active square where it [[Pin (chess)|pins]] the black knight. The downsides of this choice are that it does not help developing White's kingside, and the pawn of c4 remains unprotected. In some cases, such as the Cambridge Springs Defence (see below), Black aims to benefit from the slight dark square weaknesses left behind on the queenside after the bishop has moved outside the pawn chain. \n\nMain Black replies are (in order of frequency in high-level games): '''5...h6''' (immediately questioning the white bishop's intentions, leading to Moscow/Anti-Moscow variations), '''5...Nbd7''' (transposing to the [[Cambridge Springs Defence]]), '''5...dxc4''' (triggering the ultra-sharp Botvinnik variation) or '''5...Be7''' (transposing to the [[Orthodox Defense]] of the Queen's Gambit Declined).\n{{clear}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n===Moscow Variation: 5...h6 6.

Bxf6 Qxf6''' gives rise to play of a very different character from the Botvinnik or Anti-Moscow variations. Black has the bishop pair, which gives him good long-term chances, but must avoid prematurely opening the position in the face of White's superior development and central control, as his position is initially solid but passive. [[Alexei Dreev]], for example, has played this line successfully as Black. \n\nPlay might continue like this: '''7. e3 Nd7 8. Bd3 dxc4''' (white was threatening to play e3-e4-e5) '''9. Bxc4 g6''' (9...Bd6 is also possible) '''10. 0-0 Bg7''' and now there are various ways to continue the game for both sides. Black has the bishop pair and no immediate structural weaknesses, but his pieces are still a bit undeveloped, especially the light-squared bishop. White might continue with a queenside expansion, for example '''11. b4 0-0 12. a4''' with a lively game to follow. An alternative approach is one introduced in a game Carlsen-Karjakin (2009), where white continued with the thematic '''11. e4 e5 12. d5 Nb6 13. Bb3 Bg4'''. This allows Black to inflict doubled pawns for White, but it seems that White is able to get a lot of play against Black's weak c-pawn. The game continued: '''14. Rc1 0-0 15. h3 Bxf3 16. Qxf3 Qxf3 17. gxf3 Rfd8 18. Rfd1 Bf6 19. dxc6 bxc6 20. Rxd8+ Rxd8 21. Nd1''' and White seems to have a slight advantage.                \n\nIn order to avoid the continuations above, Black can also play '''7... g6''' instead. This makes White's typical plan of e3-e4-e5 a bit less attractive (an example line could be: 8. Bd3 Bg7 9. e4 0-0 10. 0-0 Qd8 11. e5 dxc4 12. Bxc4 c5 challenging White's center). One alternative approach was introduced in a game Kramnik-Topalov (2014 candidates), where the game continued '''8. Bd3 Bg7 9. 0-0 0-0 10. Ne5.''' This could be a strong square for the knight, since Black cannot really challenge it with a move f7-f6, given the weaknesses of the kingside pawns. Game continued  '''10...c5 11. cxd5 cxd4 12. exd4 exd5 13. Re1 Be6 14.

Bh4.''' This allows black to capture and keep the c4-pawn, but in return offers white  a lot of active play against black's weakened pawn structure and vulnerable king. The game typically continues '''6...dxc4 7. e4''' (note: 7. a4 to prevent black's b5 does not work, see below) '''g5 8. Bg3 b5''' and black has been able to defend the pawn on c4, but his position is full of weaknesses for white to attack. The Anti-Moscow variation leads to very complicated game, similar to Botvinnink variation in many ways.\n\nNote: In such positions White often considers pushing a2-a4 to prevent Black from defending the c4-pawn with b5. In this particular case, 7. a4 is a mistake. First, Black can play 7...b5 anyway, with the idea that 8. axb5 cxb5 9. Nxb5 Qb6 10. Na3 Qxb2 is very good for Black (there are some other variations, including taking Bxf6 at some point, but Black is better in any case). Second, Black can play 7...Bb4, followed up by b5 and Black is a pawn up and it is difficult to believe White has enough compensation.\n\nWhite has a number of typical plans to attack the black position all over the board. On the kingside, White can consider the move h2-h4, possibly further weakening Black's kingside pawn structure. In the center, White often plays Ne5 and opens up the d1-h5 -diagonal for his queen and bishop, as well as looks for opportunities to break through with d4-d5. It is worth mentioning that pushing the e-pawn to e5 is often not a good idea, since it blocks the white minor pieces. On the queenside, White often plays moves like a2-a4 and b2-b3 to undermine the black pawn structure. All of this is combined with the fact that black king has no strong shelter to hide, so a constant threat of mating attacks hangs in the air.\n\nWhite typically continues '''9. Be2''', and Black responds with '''9...Bb7'''. This is an important prophylactic move by Black, as White is constantly threatening to push d4-d5 to break through in the center.  White now has the option of playing either '''10. h4''' or '''10. 0-0.''' A typical line after the former is '''10. h4 g4 11. Ne5 h5 12. 0-0 Nbd7, 13. Qc2 Nxe5 14. Bxe5 Bg7''' with various possible continuations and possibly still a slight advantage for White. The latter often leads to wild complications after '''10. 0-0 Nbd7 11. Ne5 Bg7''', and now White can choose between two very different continuations. First one is '''12. Nxd7''', which typically continues '''12...Nxd7 13. Bd6 a6 14. a4 e5''' and so on. The second one, first seen in 2008 in a game between Topalov and Kramnik, is the flashy '''12. Nxf7''' (a full piece sacrifice), which leads to a wild attack after '''12...Kxf7 13. e5 Nd5 14. Ne4 Ke7 15. Nd6 Qb6 16. Bg4''' and White has a great position, strong knight on d6, control over the center and the light squares, and pressure against the weak e6 pawn. Although Black might be objectively able to survive and even convert his material advantage to a win, the complications are huge and whoever is better prepared to deal with the position has certainly the upper hand in practical games.  \n\n=== Botvinnik Variation: 5...dxc4 {{anchor|Botvinnik Variation}}===\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|Botvinnik variation\n|rd|  |bd|qd|kd|bd|  |rd\n|pd|  |  |nd|  |pd|  |  \n|  |  |pd|  |pd|nd|  |  \n|  |pd|  |  |pl|  |bl|  \n|  |  |pd|pl|  |  |  |    \n|  |  |nl|  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|pl|  |  |  |pl|pl|pl\n|rl|  |  |ql|kl|bl|  |rl\n| Position after 10...Nbd7\n}}\nThe Botvinnik variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings, with theory stretching past move thirty in some variations. The opening was introduced by [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] in the 1945 USSR vs USA radio match vs [[Arnold Denker]]. Today, [[Alex Yermolinsky]] has an excellent record with the white pieces and [[Alexei Shirov]] has been Black's chief proponent in this variation. Although this variation bears Botvinnik's name, he was not the first person known to have played it\u2014[[Klaus Junge]] is credited as the actual inventor.<ref>[[:de:Igor \u0160tohl|Igor \u0160tohl]], Chessbase Tutorials Volume 3</ref> Black makes the thematic pawn capture '''5...dxc4''' immediately. White takes control of the center with '''6.e4''' as Black defends his extra pawn with '''6...b5'''. The main line of the Botvinnik now continues '''7. e5 h6 8. Bh4 g5 9. Nxg5 hxg5''' (9...Nd5 is sometimes played, and after 10. Nxf7 Qxh4 11. Nxh8 Bb4 12. Rc1 White is objectively much better, but the position is incredibly complex to play in practice for both sides) '''10. Bxg5 Nbd7''' (10...Be7 11. exf6 Bxf6 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 13. g3 should be favorable for White). White will regain his piece with interest, emerging with an extra pawn, but Black will soon complete his development, gaining great dynamic compensation, whereas White's task is rather more difficult. White will fianchetto his king bishop and castle kingside, while Black will play c5, Qb6, castle queenside, and can carry out an attack in the center or on either flank, leading to complex play.  \n\nThe main continuation is '''11. g3''', aiming to quickly take control of the long diagonal. White can also play 11. exf6, but after 11...Bb7 12. g3 c5 13. d5 White has given Black some additional options compared to the main move, such as Nb6, Ne5, Qc7 or Bh6, which was not necessary. The 11. g3 move order does, however, open up the possibility of 11...Rg8, and play might continue 12. h4 Rxg5 13. hxg5 Nd5 14. g6 fxg6 15. Qg4 Qe7 16. Bg2 with a slight advantage for White. The main continuation is '''11...Bb7 12. Bg2 Qb6 13. exf6 0-0-0 14. 0-0 c5 15. d5 b4''' and we have reached one of the key positions of the Botvinnik variation. White now has two main continuations: '''16. Na4''' and '''16. Rb1.'''    \n\n==== 16. Na4 variation ====\nThe most challenging continuation is '''16. Na4''', where Black has two main replies. The first one, although not the best one, is '''16...Qa6''', leading to another crazy and forcing continuation: '''17. a3 Bxd5 18. Bxd5 Ne5 19. axb4 Rxd5 20. Qe2 cxb4 21. Nc3.''' The second one and probably the better one, is '''16...Qb5''', after which play might continue with multiple forcing moves '''17. a3 Nb8 18. axb4 cxb4 19. Qg4 Bxd5 20. Rfc1 Nc6 21. Bxd5 Rxd5 22. Rxc4 Rxg5 23. Qd4 Kb8 24. Rxc6 Rxg3+ 25. fxg3 Qxc6 26. Rd1 Qc7''' and so on.     \n\n==== 16. Rb1 variation ====\nWith this somewhat odd-looking move White actually prevents Black from capturing the c3-knight (16...bxc3 17. bxc3 Qa6 18. Rxb7 followed up by 19. dxe6 would be completely winning for White). Black would respond '''16...Qa6''' and play typically continues in a completely bizarre Botvinnik fashion: '''17. dxe6 Bxg2 18. e7 Bxf1''' and now either '''19. Kxf1''' or '''19. Qd5''' and so on. These positions are highly dynamic and favor first and foremost the better prepared player, although objectively speaking White might have a slight advantage.    \n\n=== Cambridge Springs Variation: 5...Nbd7 6. e3 Qa5 ===\nBlack breaks the [[Pin (chess)|pin]] on the h4\u2013d8 diagonal and forms a pin of his own on the c3-knight (exploiting the absence of the White's queen bishop from the <dfn>[[Glossary of chess#queenside|queenside]]</dfn>). If Black later plays dxc4, there may be threats against the g5-bishop.\n\n=== Orthodox Defence: 5...Be7 ===\nBreaking the pin with 5...Be7 transposes to the lines of Orthodox Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined. This move is, however, less challenging for white, at least judging by the fact that white scores more than 70% in top-level games. An example continuation is '''6. e3 Nbd7 7. Qc2 0-0 8. Rd1''' and white has a comfortable position.\n\n== Semi-Slav: 5th move alternatives ==\nAlthough more than 90% of games continue with either '''5. Bg5''' or '''5. e3''', there are some sidelines that are worth a quick look.\n\n=== 5. Qb3 variation ===\nThe move '''5. Qb3''' is an alternative way of protecting the c-pawn. If Black continues with the typical '''5...Nbd7''', White can play '''6. Bg5''' and this is supposed to lead to a favorable version of a Queen's Gambit Declined. If Black plays '''5...dxc4''' instead, White will recapture with '''6. Qxc4''' (see below).\n\n=== 5. Qd3 variation ===\nThe move '''5. Qd3''' is often combined with the idea of pushing e2-e4 in the near future. If Black continues in a typical Semi-Slav fashion with '''5...Nbd7''', then White can immediately play '''6. e4''', and after '''6...dxe4 7. Nxe4 Nxe4 8. Qxe4 Bb4+ 9. Bd2 Bxd2+ 10. Nxd2''' the game is pretty much even. White also has the option of playing '''6. g3''', leading to some sort of Catalan setup. If Black plays '''5...dxc4''' instead, White will recapture with '''6. Qxc4''' (see below).\n\n=== 5. Qb3/d3 dxc4 6. Qxc4 variation ===\nAfter either queen move, Black can continue in Semi-Slav style by capturing the white pawn with '''5...dxc4.''' Play will continue '''6. Qxc4 b5''', and now White can retreat his queen back to either b3 or d3. After '''7. Qb3''', the game might continue '''7...Nbd7 8. Bg5 Be7 9. e3''' with equal opportunities. The move '''7. Qd3''' is an alternative, and Black's best reply is considered to be '''7...a6 8. e4 c5''' and Black is supposed to be fine after either '''9. dxc5''' or '''9. e5.'''  \n\n=== 5. g3 variation ===\nBy playing '''5. g3''', White makes a claim that he's ready to play the Catalan, with the black pawn a bit passively on c6. This practically forces Black to take the c-pawn with '''5...dxc4.''' White will continue '''6. Bg2''' (6. a4 c5 is supposed to be good for Black), and Black has now two main choices. First, he can play '''6...b5''', and the game might continue in Catalan style with '''7. Ne5 a6 8. a4''' (8. Nxc6 Qb6 is fine for black) '''Bb7''' and so on. Second, he can play '''6...Nbd7''' preventing white's Ne5, which might lead to '''7. 0-0 Be7 8. e4 0-0.'''\n\n=== 5. Bf4 variation ===\nDeveloping the bishop to f4 might seem reasonable at first, but in this particular opening it is not the correct approach by White. After '''5. Bf4''' Black responds thematically '''5...dxc4''' (anything else is good for White), and is ready to defend the c-pawn with the standard push b7-b5. White's best attempt might be to continue '''6. a4''', but Black now has the move '''6...Nd5''' (since the knight is not pinned by the white bishop as it would be in the standard Bg5 lines). White's best continuation is probably '''7. Bg5''', underlining the fact that this is where the bishop should have gone in the first place. After '''7...Be7 8. Bxe7 Qxe7''' Black is porbably slightly better. If White plays '''6. e4''' as he would in a Botvinnik variation with the bishop on g5, Black simply responds '''6...b5''' and this must be a much better version of the Botvinnik for Black since White lacks the usual counterplay with e4-e5 against the pinned knight. Finally, the same logic applies for '''6. e3 b5''', and white cannot claim having enough dynamic compensation for the pawn.<br />\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{wikibooks|Chess Opening Theory|1. d4/1...d5/2. c4/2...e6/3.

Nf3/4...e6|e6]]\nThe position may readily be reached by a number of different {{chessgloss|move order|move orders}}. With Black advancing pawns to both e6 and c6, the opening resembles a mixture of the Orthodox [[Queen's Gambit Declined]] (QGD) and the [[Slav Defense]].\n\nBlack is threatening to capture the white [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] on c4, and hold it with b7\u2013b5. White can avoid this in a number of ways. About 80% of games continue '''5.Bg5''' or '''5.e3''': the former constitutes a sharp pawn sacrifice, while the latter restricts the dark-squared bishop from its natural development to g5. Other possible moves are '''5.Qb3''', '''5.g3''' and '''5.cxd5''', the last of which, after 5...exd5, leads to a line of the QGD Exchange Variation where White's early Nf3 enables Black's queen bishop to freely develop, which should give equality (''ECO'' codes D43 and D45). It is worth noting that '''5.Bf4''' is considered somewhat inaccurate, as '''5...dxc4''' is favorable for black. \n\nFor the Semi-Slav the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]]'' designates codes D43 through D49.\n{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}\n\n== First moves and possible deviations ==\nIt is possible to reach the Semi-Slav through many move orders. White player may start the game with either 1.d4, 1.Nf3 or even 1.c4, keeping the possibility of a Semi-Slav open. Black player can choose different combinations of d5, c6, e6 and Nf6 as well in order to avoid certain variations or to open up some new opportunities of his own.\n\nThis chapter looks at the first moves of the game from Black player's point of view, assuming that he would prefer to play the Semi-Slav.\n\n=== 1. d4 d5 move order ===\nIf White opens the game with '''1. d4''', Black is happy to respond with '''1...d5''' when aiming for a Semi-Slav. Of course White can continue the game with 2. Bf4 or even 2. Bg5 (as is the case if Black opens 1...Nf6), and the game will take a completely different path. In vast majority of the games, however, White players choose to play either '''2. c4''' (Queens Gambit) or '''2. Nf3'''. After '''2. Nf3''', the natural continuation for Black is '''2...Nf6.''' Playing 2...c6 or 2...e6 might be somewhat inaccurate, since White always has the option of avoiding c2-c4, so developing the knight first makes a lot of sense.\n\nIf White chooses the most common '''2. c4''', Black has three practical choices: either protect the pawn on d5 by playing e6 or c6 (keeping the option of a Semi-Slav open), or alternatively capture the white pawn with dxc4 (leading to Queen's Gambit Accepted). The first thing for Black players to consider is, what if White captures on d5 anyhow with cxd5. If Black has played the Slav move order (2...c6), then after the recapture cxd5 (\"exchange Slav\") the pawn structure is symmetrical. Should Black have played 2...e6 instead, the recapture exd5 leads to an imbalanced pawn structure called the Carlsbad structure, which might offer White some opportunities for a minority attack on the queenside.\n\n==== Slav move order: 2...c6 ====\nProtecting the d5-pawn with the c-pawn has at least three implications for Black. First, it allows Black to keep the option to enter the Slav defence, i.e., developing his light-squared bishop to f5 at the appropriate moment, before moving his e-pawn. Second, it may discourage White from capturing on d5, given the somewhat drawish reputation of the Exchange Slav. Third, it prevents White from entering the Catalan opening with 3. g3.\n\nOne drawback of playing '''2...c6''' is that White may continue '''3. Nf3''', and after '''3...Nf6''' play '''4.e3''' (\"Slow Slav\"), and now Black cannot really play the Semi-Slav since 4...e6 is considered to be good for White as he has not committed to Nc3 thus having other options to develop, like Nbd2 or b3 for instance.\n\n==== Queen's Gambit declined move order: 2...e6 ====\nProtecting the d5-pawn with the e-pawn allows Black to develop his kingside more rapidly, but it does block the light-squared bishop for the time being. After 3. Nf3 Nf6 White has the option of entering the Catalan opening with 4. g3.\n\nIf White continues '''3. Nc3''', Black has two options to proceed with a Semi-Slav in mind. First, Black can play '''3...c6''' (the \"triangle setup\", see below). Second, Black can play '''3...Nf6''', which gives White the opportunity to continue '''4. cxd5 exd5''' followed by '''5. Bg5'''.\n\n=== The triangle setup ===\n{{Chess diagram small\n |tright\n |The Triangle setup\n |rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n |pd|pd|  |  |  |pd|pd|pd\n |  |  |pd|  |pd|  |  |  \n |  |  |  |pd|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |pl|pl|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |nl|  |  |  |  |  \n |pl|pl|  |  |pl|pl|pl|pl\n |rl|  |bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl  \n |Position after 3...e6\n}}After the move order '''1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3''' black has the opportunity to respond with '''3...e6''' instead of 3...Nf6. This \"triangle setup\" opens up some new alternatives for both players on the fourth move. \n\n==== Marshall Gambit ====\nFirst, White has the opportunity to enter the '''Marshall Gambit''' by playing '''4. e4'''. Play continues '''4...dxe4''' (4...Bb4 is sometimes played, but should favor White) '''5. Nxe4 Bb4+'''. Now White has two alternative paths to continue. The main line is considered to be '''6. Bd2 Qxd4 7. Bxb4 Qxe4+''' and then White blocks the check with either his knight or bishop. Alternatively White can continue with '''6. Nc3''' (as in World Championship match Carlsen-Anand, 2013), and play continues '''6...c5 7.a3 Ba5.''' \n\n==== Noteboom variation ====\nSecond, if White continues '''4. Nf3''', Black has the extra option of playing '''4...dxc4''' entering the '''Noteboom variation'''. If White wants to avoid this variation, he must play either 4. e4 (Marshall Gambit) or 4. e3 (which usually transposes to the Meran, but deprives White of the Bg5 variations). White now has a number of possible continuations, including '''5. a4''' (see below), '''5. e3''' (often transposing to the line given below), '''5. e4''' (with similarities to the line given below), or even '''5. Bg5'''. A typical line in the Noteboom variation continues: '''5. a4 Bb4 6. e3 b5 7. Bd2 a5 8. axb5 Bxc3 9. Bxc3 cxb5 10. b3 Bb7 11. bxc4 b4 12. Bb2 Nf6 13. Bd3 Nbd7 14. 0-0 0-0''' with an interesting position where Black has two connected passed pawns on the queenside, while White has the bishop pair and dominates the center of the board. \n\nIt is worth noting, that the \"triangle setup\" is not ideal for Black if White plays '''3. Nf3''' instead of 3. Nc3. Should Black play '''3...e6''' nevertheless, White has the option of continuing with '''4. e3''' or '''4. Qc2''', for example, thus avoiding the Noteboom variation. \n\n=== 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 move order ===\nBlack has the option of delaying the move d7-d5, for instance to avoid the exchange cxd5. If White continues '''3. Nc3''', Black has the option of transposing to a Nimzo-Indian with '''3...Bb4'''. Should White choose to play '''3. Nf3''' instead, Black can simply play '''3...d5''', and then after '''4. Nc3 c6''' we are back at the start of Semi-Slav. This move order, however, allows white to play the Catalan Opening with either '''3. g3''', or alternatively '''3. Nf3 d5 4. g3'''. \n\n== Semi-Slav: 5.e3 variations ==\nRoughly 50% of the games continue with '''5.e3'''. White gives priority to developing his light-squared bishop, and accepts that for the time being the dark-squared bishop will remain somewhat out of play. The main line continues with '''5...Nbd7'''. The bishop moves 5...Bd6 and 5...Be7 are seldom seen, as masters realized early on that at e7, the bishop was passively placed and does nothing to further one of Black's aims, the freeing move ...e5. The unusual move 5...a6 is considered solid for Black. Some sources call 5...a6 the \"accelerated Meran\".<ref>https://www.365chess.com/eco/D45_Queen's_Gambit_Declined_semi-Slav_accelerated_Meran_(Alekhine_variation)</ref>\n\n===Meran Variation: 6.Bd3 {{anchor|Meran Variation}}===\n{{Chess diagram small\n |tright\n |\n |rd|  |bd|qd|kd|bd|  |rd\n |pd|pd|  |nd|  |pd|pd|pd\n |  |  |pd|  |pd|nd|  |  \n |  |  |  |pd|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |pl|pl|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |nl|bl|pl|nl|  |  \n |pl|pl|  |  |  |pl|pl|pl\n |rl|  |bl|ql|kl|  |  |rl  \n |Position after 6. Bd3\n}}One of the main variations of the Semi-Slav is the Meran Variation. White plays '''6. Bd3''', provoking the continuation '''6... dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5''' (''ECO'' codes D46 to D49) where black surrenders his center in exchange for queenside expansion and some tempi against the white bishop. The line was first played in 1906 in the game Schlechter\u2013Perlis.<ref>http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessopening?eco=D48</ref> The variation takes its name from the town of Meran ([[Merano]]) in northern Italy. During a 1924 tournament in Meran, it was used successfully in the game [[Ernst Gruenfeld|Gruenfeld]]\u2013[[Akiba Rubinstein|Rubinstein]]. Gruenfeld adopted the same variation two rounds later against [[Rudolf Spielmann|Spielmann]], winning as well.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/crosswords/chess/29chess.html \"An Opening Created in 1924 Still Leads to Complex Battles\"] ''New York Times '', 29 January 2006</ref> White will play in the center, leading to a rich, complicated game. These opposing strategies, with the ensuing keen play, have long made the Meran a favorite for enterprising players of either color. An example is Gligoric v Ljubojevic, Belgrade, 1979.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1091735 Gligoric v Ljubojevic, Belgrade, 1979]</ref>\n\nThough appearing in contemporary master play with less frequency than the Meran, there are other possibilities: '''6...Be7''', '''6...Bb4''', introduced by the Italian master [[Max Romih]], and '''6...Bd6''', which was much the most popular line before the debut of the Meran, and espoused by the American [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[Arthur Bisguier]] throughout his career.\n\nAfter the main line '''6. Bd3 dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5''' white has three alternative retreats for the bishop. Vast majority of games continue '''8. Bd3''', but the moves '''8. Bb3''' and '''8. Be2''' are possible as well.\n\n==== 8. Bd3 variation (main line) ====\nBy playing '''8. Bd3''' white returns the bishop on this ideal square, where it supports white's strategic ambition of pushing e3-e4 in the near future, and gives White the option of playing Ne4 if necessary. Black's main plan, on the other hand, is to find a way to push c6-c5 in order to free the long diagonal for his light-squared bishop and to get rid of the backward pawn on the semi-open c-file. In practice, black has three alternative moves in this position: '''8...a6''' (Classical Meran), '''8...Bb7''' (\"Modern/Improved Meran\"<ref>http://www.chess.com/article/view/larsenrsquos-improved-meran-the-great-dane-deigns-to-allow-check</ref>) or '''8. Bd6''' (which often transposes to the lines of Anti-Meran).\n\n==== 8. Bb3 variation ====\nMaintaining the bishop on the long diagonal aiming at e6 and f7 squares is an aggressive approach by white. If black is not careful, white will launch an aggressive attack towards the black king with possible knight sacrifices on e6 or f7 in the near future. An example continuation might be '''8...b4 9. Ne2 Bb7 10. Nf4 Bd6 11. Ng5''', when white is already threatening sacrifices to open up black's position, and black must respond with '''11...Bxf4''' in order not to end up in trouble.\n\n==== 8. Be2 variation ====\nRetreating the bishop to e2 instead of the typical d3-square has an impact on certain continuations, when the white queen is protecting the d-pawn. An example can be seen in a line where black plays in the typical Meran style: '''8. Be2 a6 9. e4 c5 10. e5 cxd4''' and now white has the option of playing '''11. Qxd4 Bc5  12. Qf4'''  with a comfortable advantage.\n\n<br />\n=== Classical Meran: 8...a6 ===\n{{Chess diagram small\n |tright\n |Classical Meran\n |rd|  |bd|qd|kd|bd|  |rd\n |  |  |  |nd|  |pd|pd|pd\n |pd|  |pd|  |pd|nd|  |  \n |  |pd|  |  |  |  |  |  \n |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |nl|bl|pl|nl|  |  \n |pl|pl|  |  |  |pl|pl|pl\n |rl|  |bl|ql|kl|  |  |rl  \n |Position after 8...a6\n}}\nBlack plays the move '''8...a6''' in order to protect his b5-pawn and threatening to follow up with the equalizing move c6-c5. White cannot really prevent this plan directly, so he must immediately generate some counterplay in the center with '''9. e4'''. It is possible to play also 9. a4, but the move 9.0-0 is a strategic mistake as it allows black to freely push his c-pawn which equalizes the game immediately. Black will respond with '''9...c5''', after which White has the choice between pushing his d-pawn or e-pawn, leading to very different middlegames.<br />\n\n==== 10. e5 variation (main line) ====\nPushing the e-pawn is the classical approach by white, adopted in several high level games, including World Championship match Kramnink-Anand in 2008. The black knight on f6 has no reasonable squares to go to, so black must continue his aggression by '''10...cxd4''', attacking the white knight in return. Taking the knight on f6 would favor black, so White responds '''11. Nxb5''', sacrificing his knight while still threatening Black's f6-knight. Black now has three reasonable alternatives how to proceed. Most popular and tested line continues '''11...axb5 12. exf6 gxf6 13. 0-0 Qb6 14. Qe2''' with a very interesting position. Black is up a pawn and has a very straightforward plan: play Bb7, Bd6 Rb8 and aim for the white king. Practice has shown, however, that white is doing very well in these positions, but precision is certainly required from both sides. Alternatively, Black can play '''11...Ng4''', where White might respond '''12. Qa4''', preventing the capture axb5 due to the pin on the a-file, as well as discouraging Black from capturing on e5 due to the discovered check on the black king. Nevertheless, play might continue '''12...Ngxe5 13. Nxe5 Nxe5 14. Nd6+ Ke7 15. Nxc8+ Rxc8 16. Bxa6 Ra8''' and white is clearly better but certainly not yet winning. A third alternative is to play '''11...Nxe5''', and after '''12. Nxe5 axb5 13. Bxb5+ Bd7 14. Nxd7 Qa5+ 15. Bd2 Qxb5 16. Nxf8 Kxf8''' White probably has a slight advantage but the imbalance in pawn structures will guarantee an exciting game with opportunities for both sides.\n\n==== 10. d5 variation (transposition to Reynolds Attack) ====\nWhite has the option of playing '''10. d5''' as well. This often transposes to the so called \"Reynolds attack\" (described in detail below) after, for example, the moves '''10...c4 11. Bc2 Qc7 12. 0-0 Bb7''', or some other move order.\n\n<br />\n=== Modern/Improved Meran: 8...Bb7 ===\n{{Chess diagram small\n |tright\n |Modern/Improved Meran\n |rd|  |  |qd|kd|bd|  |rd\n |pd|bd|  |nd|  |pd|pd|pd\n |  |  |pd|  |pd|nd|  |  \n |  |pd|  |  |  |  |  |  \n |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |nl|bl|pl|nl|  |  \n |pl|pl|  |  |  |pl|pl|pl\n |rl|  |bl|ql|kl|  |  |rl  \n |Position after 8...Bb7\n}}According to some sources, the move was first played in 1923. The strategic idea behind this move is to develop the light-squared bishop and possibly play b5-b4 and c6-c5 without wasting time on a7-a6. The move '''8...Bb7''' was long considered virtually unplayable due to the line '''9. e4 b4 10. Na4 c5 11. e5 Nd5 12. Nxc5 Nxc5 13. dxc5 Bxc5 14. Bb5+''' and the black king will be stuck in the center. However, it was later found, in particular through the work of Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen in late 1960's and early 1970's, that after '''14. Ke7''' black is completely fine and might be even better, with a very strong knight on d5 and strong bishops aiming at the white kingside. This forced white players to look for alternative approaches to black's modern treatment of the Meran.{{clear}}\n\n\n\n\n==== 9. 0-0 variation and Reynolds Attack ====\n{{Chess diagram small\n |tright\n |Reynolds Attack\n |rd|  |  |qd|kd|bd|  |rd\n |  |bd|  |nd|  |pd|pd|pd\n |pd|  |  |  |pd|nd|  |  \n |  |pd|pd|pl|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  \n |  |  |nl|bl|  |nl|  |  \n |pl|pl|  |  |  |pl|pl|pl\n |rl|  |bl|ql|  |rl|kl|    \n |Position after 11. d5\n}}\nWhite can simply play '''9. 0-0''', and the game often continues '''9...a6 10. e4 c5 11.d5''' leading into the so called \"Reynolds Attack\". It is worth noting that 11.e5 is no longer an option as it was in the Classical Meran, since black can respond with 11...cxd4 and now 12. Nxb5 no longer works since black has the option of playing 12...Bxf3 13. Qxf3 Nd5 and the game is very much equal. After '''11. d5''' black cannot really capture on d5, since the opening of the e-file could be disastrous for black in a practical game (although with precise computer play black seems to be fine after 11...exd5). Therefore black must allow white to capture on e6, and try to deal with the consequences.  \n\nBlack's typically develops his queen with Qc7, and he has a choice of whether or not to push the c-pawn to c4. The benefit of pushing the c-pawn is that should white capture play dxe6 and after the recapture fxe6 attack the e-pawn with either Ng5 or Nd4, black has the opportunity to defend the pawn with Nc5. Alternatively black can refrain from pushing the c-pawn to c4, which prevents white from using the d4-square for his knight in some variations. \n\nAn example variation where black keeps his c-pawn on c5 goes like this: '''11...Qc7 12. dxe6 fxe6 13. Ng5 Qc6''' after which there are many different ways to continue for both sides. \n\nIf Black instead pushes his c-pawn, this opens up several interesting opportunities for white. For example: '''11...c4 12. Bc2 Qc7 13. dxe6 fxe6''' and now White has two possible knight moves (among other alternatives) to put pressure on the black e-pawn. \n\nFirst, '''14. Ng5''' has to be met with '''14...Nc5''' (now 14...Qc6 would lead to 15. Qf3 h6 16. Qh3 - a typical queen maneuver in such positions - with a very strong advantage for White). Now White has a couple of interesting alternatives to proceed. First one is a flashy move '''15. e5''', played for example in 1994 by Kramnik against Shirov, and a couple of rounds later by Karpov against Kramnik himself. Play continues '''15...Qxe5 16. Re1 Qd6 17. Qxd6 Bxd6 18. Be3 0-0 19. Rad1 Be7 20. Bxc5 Bxc5 21. Nxe6 Rfc8''' with roughly equal chances for both. An alternative approach is to play '''15. Be3 h6''', after which White can throw in the even more flashy knight sacrifice '''16. Nxe6''', and the game typically continues '''16...Nxe6 17.e5 Qxe5 18. Bg6+''' (the point!) '''Ke7 19. Re1''' and White has a strong attack against the black king, despite being a full piece down. \n\nSecond, '''14. Nd4 Nc5 15. Qe2 Bd6''' leads to very interesting play, like for example in a game Karpov-Anand, 1998, where the game continued '''16. f4 e5 17. Ndxb5 axb5 18. Nxb5 Qb6 19. Nxd6+ Qxd6 20. fxe5 Qxe5 21. Rf5 Qe7 22. Qxc4 Rc8 23. Qb5+ Ncd7 24. Qxb7 Rxc2''' with a wild and tactical game. \n\nA lot of theory and high-level games exist on Reynolds Attack and it's different subvariations. As in many variations of the Semi-Slav, the game gets wildly tactical and provides opportunities for both sides. \n==== 9. e4 variation ====\nContinuing the game with '''9. e4 b4 10. Na4 c5 11. e5 Nd5''' is still very much an option for white. Instead of captures on c5, white can play '''12. 0-0''' with some attacking prospects. The most critical continuation is '''12...cxd4''', after which white can either play '''13. Re1''' or '''13. Nxd4''', both giving opportunity for some wild attacks on the black position. With accurate play, however, black should be fine.\n\n==== 9. a3 variation ====\nWhite has a third option to play '''9. a3''' as well. The idea is to prepare b2-b4 by white, which would make it more difficult for black to achieve his strategic plan of pushing c6-c5. Black may respond with moves like '''9...b4''', '''9...Bd6''', '''9...a6''' or '''9...a5'''.\n\n=== 8...Bd6 variation ===\nIntent of the move '''8...Bd6''' is to allow rapid castling as well as to increase black's control over the e5-square, which will be critical in many continuations. White's strategic idea in the Meran is to push e3-e4, and with a bishop on d6 Black is always ready to meet this with e6-e5, and typically Black is doing fine after such moves. Play might continue '''9. 0-0 0-0 10. Qc2 Bb7''' transposing to one of the topical lines discussed in the Anti-Meran section below. In addition there are some independent lines after 8...Bd6, where play continues with, for example, either '''9. Ng5 Bb7 10. Qf3 h6 11. Qh3'''  or '''9. Bd2 Bb7 10. Rc1 Rc8 11. a3'''.<br />\n<br />\n===Anti-Meran Variation: 6.Qc2 {{anchor|Anti-Meran Variation}}===\nThe main alternative to 6.Bd3 has become '''6.Qc2''', once a sideline, this move exploded in popularity in the 1990s, in large part due to [[Anatoly Karpov]]'s advocacy. The idea is to wait for Black to commit to ...dxc4 before playing Bd3. Black commonly replies with '''6...Bd6''' and now White can choose between a couple of very different continuations:\n\n====Karpov Variation: 7.Bd3 {{anchor|Karpov Variation}}====\nMost often white players choose the move '''7. Bd3'''. Karpov first played 7.Be2 but it soon transpired that the d3-square gives White better chances. Play usually continues '''7...dxc4 8. Bxc4 0-0 9. 0-0 b5 10. Bd3 Bb7''', after which white has several interesting options to continue the game.\n\n===== 11. a3 variation =====\n{{Chess diagram small\n |tright\n |\n |rd|  |  |qd|  |rd|kd|\n |pd|bd|  |nd|  |pd|pd|pd\n |  |  |pd|bd|pd|nd|  |  \n |  |pd|  |  |  |  |  |  \n |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  |  \n |pl|  |nl|bl|pl|nl|  |  \n |  |pl|ql|  |  |pl|pl|pl\n |rl|  |bl|  |  |rl|kl|  \n |Position after 11.a3\n}}\nOne of the \"hot\" positions of Semi-Slav occurs after '''11. a3'''. White intends to simply push b2-b4, which would seriously hamper black's strategic plan of playing c6-c5. White also often looks at transferring his knight from f3 via g5 to e4, which is something black might want to prevent. Black players have tried various approaches to combat white's plan, and the final word on this variation has certainly not been said yet.\n\nIf black responds with '''11...a5''', he is certainly slowing down white's intentions towards b4, but the cost may be too high: black will never be able to support his b-pawn with a6, and the weakness of the queenside pawn structure will be a permanent problem for black.\n\nAn alternative is to play '''11...a6''' aiming at pushing c5 next, which more or less invites white to play '''12. b4'''. Now black can respond with '''12...a5''', and the game could continue with '''13. Rb1 axb4 14. axb4 Qe7 15. e4 e5''' with very dynamic play and opportunities for both sides.\n\nPlaying '''11...Qe7''' takes the poison out of white's planned knight transfer, since after the moves '''12. Ng5 h6 13. Nge4 Nxe4 14. Nxe4 c5''' black seems to be fine. However, after '''11...Qe7''', white can continue '''12. e4 e5 13. Bg5''' and white seems to retain some advantage.\n\nA very radical approach by black is to play '''11...Rc8''', with a clear threat of placing the rook on the same file as the white queen. If white now plays '''12. b4''' to \"prevent\" black from pushing the c-pawn, black may simply respond with '''12...c5!?''' (12...a5 is the computer preference), and after '''13. bxc5 Bxf3 14. cxd6 Nd5''' the game is wide open with massive tactical complications and opportunities for both sides.\n\n===== 11. Rd1 variation =====\nPlaying '''11. Rd1''' is a possibility, but it looks like black can neutralize white's play after '''11...b4 12. Na4 c5 13. dxc5 Rc8''' and the tactics seem to work in black's favor.\n\n===== 11. e4 variation =====\nWhite can immediately push '''11.e4''', and black must respond with the thematic '''11...e5'''. Play often continues '''12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Nxe5 Bxe5  14. h3''' with some slight advantage for white.\n\n===== 11. Ng5 variation =====\nWhite can begin the thematic knight transfer immediately with '''11. Ng5'''. In such positions, black often has the tactical idea of Bxh2+ Kxh2 Ng4+ at his disposal, but in this precise variation it does not seem to provide anything for black. After '''11...h6 12. Nge4 Be7''' the position seems very equal, though. \n\n==== 7. b3 variation ====\nInstead of preparing the e3-e4 push to free his dark-squared bishop, white can also play '''7. b3''' to support the pawn on c4 and develop the bishop on the long diagonal in anticipation of future opening of the center. Play might continue '''7...0-0 8. Be2''' after which black has several viable continuations at his disposal.\n\n====Shirov\u2013Shabalov Gambit: 7.g4 {{anchor|Shirov\u2013Shabalov Gambit}}====\n{{Chess diagram small\n |tright\n |\n |rd|  |bd|qd|kd|  |  |rd\n |pd|pd|  |nd|  |pd|pd|pd\n |  |  |pd|bd|pd|nd|  |  \n |  |  |  |pd|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |pl|pl|  |  |pl|  \n |  |  |nl|  |pl|nl|  |  \n |pl|pl|ql|  |  |pl|  |pl\n |rl|  |bl|  |kl|bl|  |rl\n |Position after 7.g4\n}}\nAnother increasingly common gambit line used in the Anti-Meran is the sharp 7.g4.

Rg1'''. Black now has a number of playable continuations, including Qf6, Nxh2, f5, h5 and Nh6, and with precise play black should be fine.\n\nAn alternative to taking the pawn is to simply stop it by playing '''7...h6'''. White will continue with '''8. Rg1''' anyhow, but black has a number of playable responses.\n\nAnother popular response is to play '''7...dxc4''', but after '''8. Bxc4''' it seems that white will retain a slight advantage. Play might continue, for example, with '''8...e5 9. g5 Nd5 10. Ne4'''\n{{clear}}\n\n\n==Semi-Slav: 5.Bg5 variations==\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|  |rd\n|pd|pd|  |  |  |pd|pd|pd\n|  |  |pd|  |pd|nd|  |  \n|  |  |  |pd|  |  |bl|  \n|  |  |pl|pl|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |nl|  |  |nl|  |  \n|pl|pl|  |  |pl|pl|pl|pl\n|rl|  |  |ql|kl|bl|  |rl\n| Position after 5.Bg5\n}}\nThe Anti-Meran Gambit (''ECO'' code D44) arises after '''5.Bg5'''. White refuses to shut in the dark-squared bishop, instead developing it to an active square where it [[Pin (chess)|pins]] the black knight. The downsides of this choice are that it does not help developing White's kingside, and the pawn of c4 remains unprotected. In some cases, such as the Cambridge Springs Defence (see below), Black aims to benefit from the slight dark square weaknesses left behind on the queenside after the bishop has moved outside the pawn chain. \n\nMain Black replies are (in order of frequency in high-level games): '''5...h6''' (immediately questioning the white bishop's intentions, leading to Moscow/Anti-Moscow variations), '''5...Nbd7''' (transposing to the [[Cambridge Springs Defence]]), '''5...dxc4''' (triggering the ultra-sharp Botvinnik variation) or '''5...Be7''' (transposing to the [[Orthodox Defense]] of the Queen's Gambit Declined).\n{{clear}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n===Moscow Variation: 5...h6 6.

Bxf6 Qxf6''' gives rise to play of a very different character from the Botvinnik or Anti-Moscow variations. Black has the bishop pair, which gives him good long-term chances, but must avoid prematurely opening the position in the face of White's superior development and central control, as his position is initially solid but passive. [[Alexei Dreev]], for example, has played this line successfully as Black. \n\nPlay might continue like this: '''7. e3 Nd7 8. Bd3 dxc4''' (white was threatening to play e3-e4-e5) '''9. Bxc4 g6''' (9...Bd6 is also possible) '''10. 0-0 Bg7''' and now there are various ways to continue the game for both sides. Black has the bishop pair and no immediate structural weaknesses, but his pieces are still a bit undeveloped, especially the light-squared bishop. White might continue with a queenside expansion, for example '''11. b4 0-0 12. a4''' with a lively game to follow. An alternative approach is one introduced in a game Carlsen-Karjakin (2009), where white continued with the thematic '''11. e4 e5 12. d5 Nb6 13. Bb3 Bg4'''. This allows Black to inflict doubled pawns for White, but it seems that White is able to get a lot of play against Black's weak c-pawn. The game continued: '''14. Rc1 0-0 15. h3 Bxf3 16. Qxf3 Qxf3 17. gxf3 Rfd8 18. Rfd1 Bf6 19. dxc6 bxc6 20. Rxd8+ Rxd8 21. Nd1''' and White seems to have a slight advantage.                \n\nIn order to avoid the continuations above, Black can also play '''7... g6''' instead. This makes White's typical plan of e3-e4-e5 a bit less attractive (an example line could be: 8. Bd3 Bg7 9. e4 0-0 10. 0-0 Qd8 11. e5 dxc4 12. Bxc4 c5 challenging White's center). One alternative approach was introduced in a game Kramnik-Topalov (2014 candidates), where the game continued '''8. Bd3 Bg7 9. 0-0 0-0 10. Ne5.''' This could be a strong square for the knight, since Black cannot really challenge it with a move f7-f6, given the weaknesses of the kingside pawns. Game continued  '''10...c5 11. cxd5 cxd4 12. exd4 exd5 13. Re1 Be6 14. Bb5''' restricting the black knight and good position for White.                 \n\n                {{clear}}                                \n\n=== Anti-Moscow Variation: 5...h6 6.

Bh4.''' This allows black to capture and keep the c4-pawn, but in return offers white  a lot of active play against black's weakened pawn structure and vulnerable king. The game typically continues '''6...dxc4 7. e4''' (note: 7. a4 to prevent black's b5 does not work, see below) '''g5 8. Bg3 b5''' and black has been able to defend the pawn on c4, but his position is full of weaknesses for white to attack. The Anti-Moscow variation leads to very complicated game, similar to Botvinnink variation in many ways.\n\nNote: In such positions White often considers pushing a2-a4 to prevent Black from defending the c4-pawn with b5. In this particular case, 7. a4 is a mistake. First, Black can play 7...b5 anyway, with the idea that 8. axb5 cxb5 9. Nxb5 Qb6 10. Na3 Qxb2 is very good for Black (there are some other variations, including taking Bxf6 at some point, but Black is better in any case). Second, Black can play 7...Bb4, followed up by b5 and Black is a pawn up and it is difficult to believe White has enough compensation.\n\nWhite has a number of typical plans to attack the black position all over the board. On the kingside, White can consider the move h2-h4, possibly further weakening Black's kingside pawn structure. In the center, White often plays Ne5 and opens up the d1-h5 -diagonal for his queen and bishop, as well as looks for opportunities to break through with d4-d5. It is worth mentioning that pushing the e-pawn to e5 is often not a good idea, since it blocks the white minor pieces. On the queenside, White often plays moves like a2-a4 and b2-b3 to undermine the black pawn structure. All of this is combined with the fact that black king has no strong shelter to hide, so a constant threat of mating attacks hangs in the air.\n\nWhite typically continues '''9. Be2''', and Black responds with '''9...Bb7'''. This is an important prophylactic move by Black, as White is constantly threatening to push d4-d5 to break through in the center.  White now has the option of playing either '''10. h4''' or '''10. 0-0.''' A typical line after the former is '''10. h4 g4 11. Ne5 h5 12. 0-0 Nbd7, 13. Qc2 Nxe5 14. Bxe5 Bg7''' with various possible continuations and possibly still a slight advantage for White. The latter often leads to wild complications after '''10. 0-0 Nbd7 11. Ne5 Bg7''', and now White can choose between two very different continuations. First one is '''12. Nxd7''', which typically continues '''12...Nxd7 13. Bd6 a6 14. a4 e5''' and so on. The second one, first seen in 2008 in a game between Topalov and Kramnik, is the flashy '''12. Nxf7''' (a full piece sacrifice), which leads to a wild attack after '''12...Kxf7 13. e5 Nd5 14. Ne4 Ke7 15. Nd6 Qb6 16. Bg4''' and White has a great position, strong knight on d6, control over the center and the light squares, and pressure against the weak e6 pawn. Although Black might be objectively able to survive and even convert his material advantage to a win, the complications are huge and whoever is better prepared to deal with the position has certainly the upper hand in practical games.  \n\n=== Botvinnik Variation: 5...dxc4 {{anchor|Botvinnik Variation}}===\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|Botvinnik variation\n|rd|  |bd|qd|kd|bd|  |rd\n|pd|  |  |nd|  |pd|  |  \n|  |  |pd|  |pd|nd|  |  \n|  |pd|  |  |pl|  |bl|  \n|  |  |pd|pl|  |  |  |    \n|  |  |nl|  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|pl|  |  |  |pl|pl|pl\n|rl|  |  |ql|kl|bl|  |rl\n| Position after 10...Nbd7\n}}\nThe Botvinnik variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings, with theory stretching past move thirty in some variations. The opening was introduced by [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] in the 1945 USSR vs USA radio match vs [[Arnold Denker]]. Today, [[Alex Yermolinsky]] has an excellent record with the white pieces and [[Alexei Shirov]] has been Black's chief proponent in this variation. Although this variation bears Botvinnik's name, he was not the first person known to have played it\u2014[[Klaus Junge]] is credited as the actual inventor.<ref>[[:de:Igor \u0160tohl|Igor \u0160tohl]], Chessbase Tutorials Volume 3</ref> Black makes the thematic pawn capture '''5...dxc4''' immediately. White takes control of the center with '''6.e4''' as Black defends his extra pawn with '''6...b5'''. The main line of the Botvinnik now continues '''7. e5 h6 8. Bh4 g5 9. Nxg5 hxg5''' (9...Nd5 is sometimes played, and after 10. Nxf7 Qxh4 11. Nxh8 Bb4 12. Rc1 White is objectively much better, but the position is incredibly complex to play in practice for both sides) '''10. Bxg5 Nbd7''' (10...Be7 11. exf6 Bxf6 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 13. g3 should be favorable for White). White will regain his piece with interest, emerging with an extra pawn, but Black will soon complete his development, gaining great dynamic compensation, whereas White's task is rather more difficult. White will fianchetto his king bishop and castle kingside, while Black will play c5, Qb6, castle queenside, and can carry out an attack in the center or on either flank, leading to complex play.  \n\nThe main continuation is '''11. g3''', aiming to quickly take control of the long diagonal. White can also play 11. exf6, but after 11...Bb7 12. g3 c5 13. d5 White has given Black some additional options compared to the main move, such as Nb6, Ne5, Qc7 or Bh6, which was not necessary. The 11. g3 move order does, however, open up the possibility of 11...Rg8, and play might continue 12. h4 Rxg5 13. hxg5 Nd5 14. g6 fxg6 15. Qg4 Qe7 16. Bg2 with a slight advantage for White. The main continuation is '''11...Bb7 12. Bg2 Qb6 13. exf6 0-0-0 14. 0-0 c5 15. d5 b4''' and we have reached one of the key positions of the Botvinnik variation. White now has two main continuations: '''16. Na4''' and '''16. Rb1.'''    \n\n==== 16. Na4 variation ====\nThe most challenging continuation is '''16. Na4''', where Black has two main replies. The first one, although not the best one, is '''16...Qa6''', leading to another crazy and forcing continuation: '''17. a3 Bxd5 18. Bxd5 Ne5 19. axb4 Rxd5 20. Qe2 cxb4 21. Nc3.''' The second one and probably the better one, is '''16...Qb5''', after which play might continue with multiple forcing moves '''17. a3 Nb8 18. axb4 cxb4 19. Qg4 Bxd5 20. Rfc1 Nc6 21. Bxd5 Rxd5 22. Rxc4 Rxg5 23. Qd4 Kb8 24. Rxc6 Rxg3+ 25. fxg3 Qxc6 26. Rd1 Qc7''' and so on.     \n\n==== 16. Rb1 variation ====\nWith this somewhat odd-looking move White actually prevents Black from capturing the c3-knight (16...bxc3 17. bxc3 Qa6 18. Rxb7 followed up by 19. dxe6 would be completely winning for White). Black would respond '''16...Qa6''' and play typically continues in a completely bizarre Botvinnik fashion: '''17. dxe6 Bxg2 18. e7 Bxf1''' and now either '''19. Kxf1''' or '''19. Qd5''' and so on. These positions are highly dynamic and favor first and foremost the better prepared player, although objectively speaking White might have a slight advantage.    \n\n=== Cambridge Springs Variation: 5...Nbd7 6. e3 Qa5 ===\nBlack breaks the [[Pin (chess)|pin]] on the h4\u2013d8 diagonal and forms a pin of his own on the c3-knight (exploiting the absence of the White's queen bishop from the <dfn>[[Glossary of chess#queenside|queenside]]</dfn>). If Black later plays dxc4, there may be threats against the g5-bishop.\n\n=== Orthodox Defence: 5...Be7 ===\nBreaking the pin with 5...Be7 transposes to the lines of Orthodox Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined. This move is, however, less challenging for white, at least judging by the fact that white scores more than 70% in top-level games. An example continuation is '''6. e3 Nbd7 7. Qc2 0-0 8. Rd1''' and white has a comfortable position.\n\n== Semi-Slav: 5th move alternatives ==\nAlthough more than 90% of games continue with either '''5. Bg5''' or '''5. e3''', there are some sidelines that are worth a quick look.\n\n=== 5. Qb3 variation ===\nThe move '''5. Qb3''' is an alternative way of protecting the c-pawn. If Black continues with the typical '''5...Nbd7''', White can play '''6. Bg5''' and this is supposed to lead to a favorable version of a Queen's Gambit Declined. If Black plays '''5...dxc4''' instead, White will recapture with '''6. Qxc4''' (see below).\n\n=== 5. Qd3 variation ===\nThe move '''5. Qd3''' is often combined with the idea of pushing e2-e4 in the near future. If Black continues in a typical Semi-Slav fashion with '''5...Nbd7''', then White can immediately play '''6. e4''', and after '''6...dxe4 7. Nxe4 Nxe4 8. Qxe4 Bb4+ 9. Bd2 Bxd2+ 10. Nxd2''' the game is pretty much even. White also has the option of playing '''6. g3''', leading to some sort of Catalan setup. If Black plays '''5...dxc4''' instead, White will recapture with '''6. Qxc4''' (see below).\n\n=== 5. Qb3/d3 dxc4 6. Qxc4 variation ===\nAfter either queen move, Black can continue in Semi-Slav style by capturing the white pawn with '''5...dxc4.''' Play will continue '''6. Qxc4 b5''', and now White can retreat his queen back to either b3 or d3. After '''7. Qb3''', the game might continue '''7...Nbd7 8. Bg5 Be7 9. e3''' with equal opportunities. The move '''7. Qd3''' is an alternative, and Black's best reply is considered to be '''7...a6 8. e4 c5''' and Black is supposed to be fine after either '''9. dxc5''' or '''9. e5.'''  \n\n=== 5. g3 variation ===\nBy playing '''5. g3''', White makes a claim that he's ready to play the Catalan, with the black pawn a bit passively on c6. This practically forces Black to take the c-pawn with '''5...dxc4.''' White will continue '''6. Bg2''' (6. a4 c5 is supposed to be good for Black), and Black has now two main choices. First, he can play '''6...b5''', and the game might continue in Catalan style with '''7. Ne5 a6 8. a4''' (8. Nxc6 Qb6) '''Bb7''' and so on. Second, he can play '''6...Nbd7''' preventing white's Ne5, which might lead to '''7. 0-0 Be7 8. e4 0-0.'''\n\n=== 5. Bf4 variation ===\nDeveloping the bishop to f4 might seem reasonable at first, but in this particular opening it is not the correct approach by White. After '''5. Bf4''' Black responds thematically '''5...dxc4''' (anything else is good for White), and is ready to defend the c-pawn with the standard push b7-b5. White's best attempt might be to continue '''6. a4''', but Black now has the move '''6...Nd5''' (since the knight is not pinned by the white bishop as it would be in the standard Bg5 lines). White's best continuation is probably '''7. Bg5''', underlining the fact that this is where the bishop should have gone in the first place. After '''7...Be7 8. Bxe7 Qxe7''' Black is porbably slightly better. If White plays '''6. e4''' as he would in a Botvinnik variation with the bishop on g5, Black simply responds '''6...b5''' and this must be a much better version of the Botvinnik for Black since White lacks the usual counterplay with e4-e5 against the pinned knight. Finally, the same logic applies for '''6. e3 b5''', and white cannot claim having enough dynamic compensation for the pawn.<br />\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{wikibooks|Chess Opening Theory|1. d4/1...d5/2. c4/2...e6/3.

It belongs to the [[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]]. Its sister cities are [[Ephrata, Pennsylvania|Ephrata]], [[United States]] and [[Thonon-les-Bains]], [[France]].\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Location ===\nEberbach lies at the foot of the [[Katzenbuckel]], at 626 m the highest elevation in the [[Odenwald]], in the ''Naturpark Neckartal-Odenwald'', on the romantic [[Castle Road|''Burgenstra\u00dfe'' (Castle Road)]] along the river [[Neckar]].\n\n=== Boroughs ===\nEberbach includes the boroughs of Neckarwimmersbach, Brombach, Friedrichsdorf, Lindach, Rockenau, Badisch Igelsbach, Gaim\u00fchle, Unterdielbach, Badisch Sch\u00f6llenbach and Pleutersbach.\n\nThe border with [[Hesse]] runs through the borough of Igelsbach. Therefore, only the northeast half, called ''Badisch Igelsbach'', of the borough belongs to Eberbach. The southwest half, called ''Hessisch Igelsbach'', belongs to the Hessian municipality of [[Hirschhorn (Neckar)|Hirschhorn]]. The same is true for the borough Sch\u00f6llenbach. The larger part of Sch\u00f6llenbach belongs to the municipality of [[Hesseneck]].\n\n== History ==\nEberbach is a former [[Imperial Free City]], founded soon after 1227\u2014when the [[castle]] was first mentioned\u2014by German King [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry VII]] of the House of [[Hohenstaufen]]. After his pledge to the [[Count palatine|Counts Palatine]] in 1330, the old Free City belonged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. In 1803 it passed to the [[Principality of Leiningen]], and since 1806 it has belonged to [[Baden]]. Until 1924 it was the seat of the authority office (''Bezirksamt''). In 1977 the town celebrated its 750-year jubilee.\n\n== Main sights ==\n[[File:Eberbach-pulverturm-web.jpg|thumb|Pulverturm]]\n[[File:Eberbach-haspelturm-web2.jpg|thumb|Haspelturm und Spohrsches Haus]]\n[[File:Eberbach-rostenturm-web.jpg|thumb|Rosenturm]]\n[[File:Eberbach-Blauerhut-web.jpg|thumb|Blauer Hut]]\n\nThe historic old town, which is a [[pedestrian precinct]], with its four well maintained towers, many well kept [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and some town wall remnants, is a magnet for tourists. Likewise, the Eberbach castle ruins, which stand above the town on one of the mountains in the Odenwald range that surrounds the town, are worthy of sightseeing as part of the string of castles along the river Neckar. Eberbach also lies on the ''Burgenstra\u00dfe'' (Castle Road), which leads from [[Mannheim]] all the way to [[Prague]].\n\nThe Ohrsberg is a peak in Eberbach. It shapes the town and is 229&nbsp;m (751&nbsp;ft) high.\n\n=== Museums ===\nSeveral museums can be found in Eberbach:\n*''Heimatmuseum der Stadt Eberbach'' \u2014 Museum of Local History for the Town of Eberbach\n*''K\u00fcfereimuseum'' \u2014 [[cooper (profession)|cooper]]age museum\n*''Zinnfiguren-Kabinett'' \u2014 tin figures\n\n==Government==\n\n[[File:Eberbach-rathaus-web.jpg|thumb|Eberbach town hall]]\n\n===Municipal council===\nEberbach town council has 22 members, who are elected every five years.

This makes the coat of arms a [[rebus]] of the town's name \u2013 a \"[[Canting arms|canting]]\" coat of arms \u2013 since it shows a [[boar]] (''Eber'' in [[German language|German]]) and a wavy blue line representing a [[stream|brook]] (''Bach'' in German). Eberbach's flag is blue and white (or blue and silver). As an Imperial City, Eberbach would have had leave originally to have its arms bear the Imperial [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]]. The Imperial eagle was once to be found in the town wall at the upper gate. A photograph taken of it in 1909, along with the armorial stone itself, are today kept in the Town Museum, where they may be seen. The current coat of arms has been established to be from a seal impression dating back to 1387. The boar's appearance, however, in today's arms, adopted in 1976, is clearly unlike the original.\n\n== Cultural events ==\nThe following events are held yearly:\n*''Apfeltag'' (Apple Day) \u2013 mid-October\n*''B\u00e4rlauchtage'' (''Bear Garlic'' Days) - mid-March to mid-April celebrate [[Ramsons]]\n*''Fr\u00fchlingsfest'' (Spring Festival) - mid-May\n*''Kuckucksmarkt'' (Cuckoo Market): Eberbach's Cuckoo Market is a folk festival on the last weekend of August. The name traces itself back to an old traditional story. According to the tale, an Eberbacher (from the main town north of the Neckar) in an inn in Neckarwimmersbach (on the south bank) was served a cuckoo, rather than the pigeon that he had ordered. This he then proceeded to consume. The Cuckoo Market is held in Neckarwimmersbach at the \"In der Au\" sports grounds and in several streets (Schwanheimer Stra\u00dfe, Beckstra\u00dfe, Neckarbr\u00fccke). It was once held on the Neckar's north bank between Pulverturm and Gr\u00fcner Baum, which is nowadays where the aforesaid Spring Festival is held.\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n[[File:Eberbach Neckar 2001.JPG|thumb|View from Neckar lookout]]\n[[File:Eberbach 20.Juni 2003 Altes Badhaus.jpg|thumb|Old Bathhouse]]\n\n=== Transport ===\nThe '''S 1/2''' lines of the [[Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn]] run half-hourly along the [[Neckar Valley Railway]] towards [[Mosbach]] and [[Heidelberg Central Station|Heidelberg]]/[[Mannheim Central Station|Mannheim]]. Moreover, regional express trains shuttle along this same right of way two-hourly bound for Mannheim and [[Heilbronn Central Station|Heilbronn]]. Regional trains also run every two hours along the ''[[Odenwald Railway (Hesse)|Odenwaldbahn]]'' to [[Darmstadt Central Station|Darmstadt]] and [[Frankfurt Central Station|Frankfurt]].\n\nEberbach, unlike most towns of comparable size, maintains its own transport system, the ''Stadtwerke Eberbach'' (SWE). The fleet comprises all together 6 [[bus]]es which weekdays serve the main routes (Ledigsberg and Eberbach/Nord) from 5:10 to 19:30 half-hourly, and lesser routes irregularly. Saturdays the buses run from 6:30 to 14:50. At the Spring Festival and the Cuckoo Market, special services are laid on. In the latter case, the service runs quite late into the evening to accommodate \"marketgoers\".\n\nThe town transport serves the following routes:\n\n*801, 807: [[Railway station]] \u2013 Ledigsberg\n*802, 802a, 809: Railway station \u2013 Eberbach/Nord\n*803: Railway station \u2013 Rockenau\n*804: Railway station \u2013 Igelsbach\n*805: Railway station \u2013 Holdergrund\n*806: Hirschhorn \u2013 Brombach; this line is run by the Heckmann firm on the SWE's behalf.\n\nFurthermore, the ''Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar'' (VRN) and ''Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund'' (RMV) transport systems serve various regional bus routes.\n\nEberbach also lies on the well-used ''Bundesstra\u00dfen'' (Federal Highways) B37 and B45.\n\n=== Established enterprises ===\nEberbach is headquarters to the world's biggest [[gelatin]] producer, the [[Gelita]], the [[textile]] machine factory Dilo, the [[Watercraft rowing|rowboat]] building yard [[Empacher]] and the ticket vending and fare collecting machine manufacturer, Krauth Technology, whose products are sold worldwide. The headquarters of the Neckardraht Group (wire makers) is likewise also found in the town on the Neckar.\n\n=== Media ===\n*The ''[[Eberbacher Zeitung]]'' is a daily [[newspaper]] built on groundwork laid out by the ''[[S\u00fcdwest-Presse]]'', an [[Ulm]] newspaper.\n* The ''Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung'' maintains its own local editing in Eberbach and publishes a special Eberbach and area edition (''Eberbacher Nachrichten'').\n*The ''Eberbach-Channel'' (see link below) is an online information service for Eberbach and area.\n*Filling this out are many weekly editions of free newspapers funded through [[advertising]].\n\n=== Education ===\n*Steige[[Primary education|grundschule]]\n*Dr.-Wei\u00df Grund- und [[Special school|F\u00f6rderschule]]\n*[[Hauptschule]] Eberbach\n*[[Realschule]] Eberbach\n*Hohenstaufen-[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]\n*[[Vocational school|Gewerbeschule]] Eberbach\n\n==Health services==\nHospital of the Gesundheitszentren Rhein Neckar GmbH (GRN) \n* [[Internal medicine]]\n* Surgery\n* Urology\n* Anaesthesia\n* HNO\n* [[Gynaecology]]\n* [[Proctology]]\n* Short-term care\n* Physiotherapy\n* Training for nursing\n\n== Notable natives ==\n<!-- === Ehrenb\u00fcrger === -->\n* [[Johann Conrad Beissel]] (1691-1768), emigrant who founded the Ephrata  monastery in Ephrata, Pennsylvania (USA) \n* [[Robert Heinrich Wagner]] (1895-1946), NS functionary, Gauleiter of Baden and \"chief of the civil administration\" in occupied Alsace, executed for war crimes\n* [[Alfred Wolf (rabbi)]] (1915-2004), rabbi in Los Angeles\n* Eduard Ritsert (1859\u20131946), chemist, inventor of [[Benzocaine]] <ref>https://www.woodlibrarymuseum.org/museum/item/802/benzocaine</ref>\n\n==International relations==\n{{Main|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\n\nEberbach (Baden) is [[town twinning|twinned]] with:\n* {{flagicon|France}} [[Thonon-les-Bains]], [[France]]\n* {{flagicon|United States}} [[Ephrata, Pennsylvania|Ephrata]], [[United States]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons and category|Eberbach (Baden)}}\n* {{in lang|de}} [http://www.eberbach.de/ Town's official website]\n* {{in lang|de}} [http://www.ebch.de/ Eberbach Channel \u2013 Online town magazine with current news]\n* {{in lang|de}} [http://www.pleutersbach.de/ Pleutersbach home page, a borrough of Eberbach]\n* {{in lang|de}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20050208050932/http://www.rockenau.de/ Rockenau Sports Club home page]\n* [http://www.burgenstrasse.de/?lang=uk Tourist information for ''die Burgstrasse'', the Castle Road]\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Eberbach (town)|display=Eberbach, a town of Germany, in the grand-duchy of Baden |short=x}}\n\n{{Cities and towns in Rhein-Neckar (district)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:1227 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:Baden]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox German location\n| type              = Stadt\n| name              = Eberbach\n| image_photo       = Eberbach Hotel zum Karpfen.jpg\n| image_caption     = Hotel Karpfen\n| image_coa         = DEU Eberbach COA.svg\n| coordinates       = {{coord|49|28|N|08|59|E|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| image_plan        = Eberbach in HD.svg\n| plansize          = 190\n| state             = Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\n| region            = Karlsruhe\n| district          = Rhein-Neckar-Kreis\n| elevation         = 134\n| area              = 81.16\n| population        = 15344\n| Stand             = 2006-09-30\n| Gemeindeschl\u00fcssel = 08226013\n| postal_code       = 69401\u201369412\n| PLZ-alt           = 6930\n| area_code         = 06271\n| licence           = HD\n| website           = [http://www.eberbach.de/ www.eberbach.de]\n| mayor             = Peter Reichert\n| party             = FW\n}}\n{{Location map | Germany Neckar\n| caption = Eberbach on Neckar River\n| label = Eberbach | background = #DDDD77\n| position=right | label_size = 87 <!--percent 0-900% -->\n| lat_deg = 49 | lat_min = 28\n| lon_deg = 08 | lon_min = 59\n| float = right | width = 220 \n}}\n'''Eberbach''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8e\u02d0b\u0250bax}}) is a town in [[Germany]], in northern [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], located 33&nbsp;km east of [[Heidelberg]].

This makes the coat of arms a [[rebus]] of the town's name \u2013 a \"[[Canting arms|canting]]\" coat of arms \u2013 since it shows a [[boar]] (''Eber'' in [[German language|German]]) and a wavy blue line representing a [[stream|brook]] (''Bach'' in German). Eberbach's flag is blue and white (or blue and silver). As an Imperial City, Eberbach would have had leave originally to have its arms bear the Imperial [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]]. The Imperial eagle was once to be found in the town wall at the upper gate. A photograph taken of it in 1909, along with the armorial stone itself, are today kept in the Town Museum, where they may be seen. The current coat of arms has been established to be from a seal impression dating back to 1387. The boar's appearance, however, in today's arms, adopted in 1976, is clearly unlike the original.\n\n== Cultural events ==\nThe following events are held yearly:\n*''Apfeltag'' (Apple Day) \u2013 mid-October\n*''B\u00e4rlauchtage'' (''Bear Garlic'' Days) - mid-March to mid-April celebrate [[Ramsons]]\n*''Fr\u00fchlingsfest'' (Spring Festival) - mid-May\n*''Kuckucksmarkt'' (Cuckoo Market): Eberbach's Cuckoo Market is a folk festival on the last weekend of August. The name traces itself back to an old traditional story. According to the tale, an Eberbacher (from the main town north of the Neckar) in an inn in Neckarwimmersbach (on the south bank) was served a cuckoo, rather than the pigeon that he had ordered. This he then proceeded to consume. The Cuckoo Market is held in Neckarwimmersbach at the \"In der Au\" sports grounds and in several streets (Schwanheimer Stra\u00dfe, Beckstra\u00dfe, Neckarbr\u00fccke). It was once held on the Neckar's north bank between Pulverturm and Gr\u00fcner Baum, which is nowadays where the aforesaid Spring Festival is held.\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n[[File:Eberbach Neckar 2001.JPG|thumb|View from Neckar lookout]]\n[[File:Eberbach 20.Juni 2003 Altes Badhaus.jpg|thumb|Old Bathhouse]]\n\n=== Transport ===\nThe '''S 1/2''' lines of the [[Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn]] run half-hourly along the [[Neckar Valley Railway]] towards [[Mosbach]] and [[Heidelberg Central Station|Heidelberg]]/[[Mannheim Central Station|Mannheim]]. Moreover, regional express trains shuttle along this same right of way two-hourly bound for Mannheim and [[Heilbronn Central Station|Heilbronn]]. Regional trains also run every two hours along the ''[[Odenwald Railway (Hesse)|Odenwaldbahn]]'' to [[Darmstadt Central Station|Darmstadt]] and [[Frankfurt Central Station|Frankfurt]].\n\nEberbach, unlike most towns of comparable size, maintains its own transport system, the ''Stadtwerke Eberbach'' (SWE). The fleet comprises all together 6 [[bus]]es which weekdays serve the main routes (Ledigsberg and Eberbach/Nord) from 5:10 to 19:30 half-hourly, and lesser routes irregularly. Saturdays the buses run from 6:30 to 14:50. At the Spring Festival and the Cuckoo Market, special services are laid on. In the latter case, the service runs quite late into the evening to accommodate \"marketgoers\".\n\nThe town transport serves the following routes:\n\n*801, 807: [[Railway station]] \u2013 Ledigsberg\n*802, 802a, 809: Railway station \u2013 Eberbach/Nord\n*803: Railway station \u2013 Rockenau\n*804: Railway station \u2013 Igelsbach\n*805: Railway station \u2013 Holdergrund\n*806: Hirschhorn \u2013 Brombach; this line is run by the Heckmann firm on the SWE's behalf.\n\nFurthermore, the ''Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar'' (VRN) and ''Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund'' (RMV) transport systems serve various regional bus routes.\n\nEberbach also lies on the well-used ''Bundesstra\u00dfen'' (Federal Highways) B37 and B45.\n\n=== Established enterprises ===\nEberbach is headquarters to the world's biggest [[gelatin]] producer, the [[Gelita]], the [[textile]] machine factory Dilo, the [[Watercraft rowing|rowboat]] building yard [[Empacher]] and the ticket vending and fare collecting machine manufacturer, Krauth Technology, whose products are sold worldwide. The headquarters of the Neckardraht Group (wire makers) is likewise also found in the town on the Neckar.\n\n=== Media ===\n*The ''[[Eberbacher Zeitung]]'' is a daily [[newspaper]] built on groundwork laid out by the ''[[S\u00fcdwest-Presse]]'', an [[Ulm]] newspaper.\n* The ''Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung'' maintains its own local editing in Eberbach and publishes a special Eberbach and area edition (''Eberbacher Nachrichten'').\n*The ''Eberbach-Channel'' (see link below) is an online information service for Eberbach and area.\n*Filling this out are many weekly editions of free newspapers funded through [[advertising]].\n\n=== Education ===\n*Steige[[Primary education|grundschule]]\n*Dr.-Wei\u00df Grund- und [[Special school|F\u00f6rderschule]]\n*[[Hauptschule]] Eberbach\n*[[Realschule]] Eberbach\n*Hohenstaufen-[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]\n*[[Vocational school|Gewerbeschule]] Eberbach\n\n==Health services==\nHospital of the Gesundheitszentren Rhein Neckar GmbH (GRN) \n* [[Internal medicine]]\n* Surgery\n* Urology\n* Anaesthesia\n* HNO\n* [[Gynaecology]]\n* [[Proctology]]\n* Short-term care\n* Physiotherapy\n* Training for nursing\n\n== Notable natives ==\n<!-- === Ehrenb\u00fcrger === -->\n* [[Johann Conrad Beissel]] (1691-1768), emigrant who founded the Ephrata  monastery in Ephrata, Pennsylvania (USA) \n* [[Robert Heinrich Wagner]] (1895-1946), NS functionary, Gauleiter of Baden and \"chief of the civil administration\" in occupied Alsace, executed for war crimes\n* [[Alfred Wolf (rabbi)]] (1915-2004), rabbi in Los Angeles\n* Eduard Ritsert (1859\u20131946), chemist, inventor of [[Benzocaine]] <ref>https://www.woodlibrarymuseum.org/museum/item/802/benzocaine</ref>\n\n==International relations==\n{{Main|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\n\nEberbach (Baden) is [[town twinning|twinned]] with:\n* {{flagicon|France}} [[Thonon-les-Bains]], [[France]]\n* {{flagicon|United States}} [[Ephrata, Pennsylvania|Ephrata]], [[United States]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons and category|Eberbach (Baden)}}\n* {{in lang|de}} [http://www.eberbach.de/ Town's official website]\n* {{in lang|de}} [http://www.ebch.de/ Eberbach Channel \u2013 Online town magazine with current news]\n* {{in lang|de}} [http://www.pleutersbach.de/ Pleutersbach home page, a borrough of Eberbach]\n* {{in lang|de}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20050208050932/http://www.rockenau.de/ Rockenau Sports Club home page]\n* [http://www.burgenstrasse.de/?lang=uk Tourist information for ''die Burgstrasse'', the Castle Road]\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Eberbach (town)|display=Eberbach, a town of Germany, in the grand-duchy of Baden |short=x}}\n\n{{Cities and towns in Rhein-Neckar (district)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:1227 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:Baden]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberbach_(Baden)"}
