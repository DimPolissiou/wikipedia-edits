By 1916 in Britain, the leader of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], and in the neutral United States, long-range thinkers had begun to design a unified international organisation to prevent future wars. Historian Peter Yearwood argues that when the new coalition government of [[Lloyd George ministry|David Lloyd George]] took power in December 1916, there was widespread discussion among intellectuals and diplomats of the desirability of establishing such an organisation. When Lloyd George was challenged by Wilson to state his position with an eye on the postwar situation, he endorsed such an organisation.  Wilson himself included in his [[Fourteen Points]] in January 1918 a \"league of nations to ensure peace and justice.\" British foreign secretary, [[Arthur Balfour]], argued that, as a condition of durable peace, \"behind international law, and behind all treaty arrangements for preventing or limiting hostilities, some form of international sanction should be devised which would give pause to the hardiest aggressor.\"<ref>Peter Yearwood, \"\u2018On the Safe and Right Lines\u2019: The Lloyd George Government and the Origins of the League of Nations, 1916\u20131918.\" ''Historical Journal'' 32#1 (1989): 131\u2013155.</ref>\n\nThe war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage.<ref>P.

The causes identified included arms races, alliances, militaristic nationalism, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit.

The French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] became the first chairman of the committee.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=186\u2013187}} The work of the committee included: inquiry into the conditions of intellectual life, assistance to countries where intellectual life was endangered, creation of national committees for intellectual co-operation, co-operation with international intellectual organisations, protection of intellectual property, inter-university co-operation, co-ordination of bibliographical work and international interchange of publications, and international co-operation in archaeological research.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=187\u2013189}}\n\nIntroduced by the second [[International Opium Convention]], the Permanent Central Opium Board had to supervise the statistical reports on trade in [[opium]], morphine, cocaine and heroin.

Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early [[interwar period]], the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered in its early years included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=70\u201372}}\n\nAs the League developed, its role expanded, and by the middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of international activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=170.}}\n\n===\u00c5land Islands===\n{{Main|\u00c5land crisis}}\n[[\u00c5land]] is a collection of around 6,500 islands in the Baltic Sea, midway between [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. The islands are almost exclusively [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking, but in 1809, the \u00c5land Islands, along with Finland, were taken by [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian [[October Revolution]], Finland declared its independence, but most of the \u00c5landers wished to rejoin Sweden.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=60}} The Finnish government considered the islands to be a part of their new nation, as the Russians had included \u00c5land in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], formed in 1809. By 1920, the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war. The British government referred the problem to the League's Council, but Finland would not let the League intervene, as they considered it an internal matter. The League created a small panel to decide if it should investigate the matter and, with an affirmative response, a neutral commission was created.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=60}} In June 1921, the League announced its decision: the islands were to remain a part of Finland, but with guaranteed protection of the islanders, including demilitarisation. With Sweden's reluctant agreement, this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=77\u201378}}\n\n===Upper Silesia===\nThe Allied powers referred the problem of [[Upper Silesia]] to the League after they had been unable to resolve the territorial dispute.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=82\u201383}} After the First World War, [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] laid claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of [[Prussia]]. The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|plebiscite in Upper Silesia]] to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland. Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two [[Silesian Uprisings]] (1919 and 1920). A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 per cent (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the [[Third Silesian Uprising]] in 1921.{{sfn|Osmanczyk|Mango|2002|p=2568}}\n\nOn 12 August 1921, the League was asked to settle the matter; the Council created a commission with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain to study the situation.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=88}} The committee recommended that Upper Silesia be divided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the plebiscite and that the two sides should decide the details of the interaction between the two areas \u2013 for example, whether goods should pass freely over the border due to the economic and industrial interdependence of the two areas.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=83}} In November 1921, a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five meetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany, but with the Polish section containing the majority of the region's mineral resources and much of its industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment was expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries. The settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second World War.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=88}}\n\n===Albania===\nThe frontiers of the [[Principality of Albania]] had not been set during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, as they were left for the League to decide; they had not yet been determined by September 1921, creating an unstable situation. [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greek]] troops conducted military operations in the south of Albania. [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, in the northern part of the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November 1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=103\u2013105}}\n\nThe borders of Albania again became the cause of international conflict when Italian General [[Enrico Tellini]] and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 24 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] was incensed and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days. Whatever the results of the investigation, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government pay Italy fifty million [[Italian lira|lire]] in reparations. The Greeks said they would not pay unless it was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=86}}\n\nMussolini sent a warship to shell the Greek island of [[Corfu]], and Italian forces [[Corfu incident|occupied the island]] on 31 August 1923. This contravened the League's covenant, so Greece appealed to the League to deal with the situation. The Allies agreed (at Mussolini's insistence) that the [[Conference of Ambassadors]] should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=87}} Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=110}}\n\n===Memel===\n{{Main|Klaip\u0117da Revolt}}\nThe port city of [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] (now [[Klaip\u0117da]]) and [[Klaip\u0117da Region|the surrounding area]], with a predominantly German population, was under provisional Entente control according to Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles. The French and Polish governments favoured turning Memel into an [[international city]], while [[Lithuania]] wanted to annex the area. By 1923, the fate of the area had still not been decided, prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and seize the port. After the Allies failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania, they referred the matter to the League of Nations. In December 1923, the League Council appointed a Commission of Inquiry. The commission chose to cede Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights. The [[Klaip\u0117da Convention]] was approved by the League Council on 14 March 1924, and then by the Allied powers and Lithuania.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=107}} In 1939 Germany retook the region following the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and an [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|ultimatum to Lithuania]], demanding the return of the region under threat of war. The League of Nations failed to prevent the secession of the Memel region to Germany.\n\n===Hatay===\n{{Main|Hatay State}}\nWith League oversight, the [[Sanjak]] of [[\u0130skenderun|Alexandretta]] in the [[French Mandate of Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate of Syria]] was given autonomy in 1937. Renamed Hatay, its parliament declared independence as the [[Hatay State|Republic of Hatay]] in September 1938, after elections the previous month. It was annexed by [[Turkey]] with French consent in mid-1939.<ref>{{cite book|pages=117\u2013121|author=\u00c7a\u01e7aptay, Soner|title=Islam, secularism, and nationalism in modern Turkey|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-38458-2}}</ref>\n\n===Mosul===\n{{Main|Mosul Question}}\nThe League resolved a dispute between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey over control of the former Ottoman province of [[Mosul Vilayet|Mosul]] in 1926. According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|mandate over Iraq]] in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul did not want to be part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=133}} In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted the League of Nations' arbitration in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]], it rejected the decision, questioning the Council's authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admission.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=107\u2013108}}{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=131\u2013135}}\n\n===Vilnius===\n{{Main|\u017beligowski's Mutiny}}\nAfter the First World War, Poland and Lithuania both regained their independence but soon became immersed in territorial disputes.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}} During the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]], Lithuania signed the [[Soviet\u2013Lithuanian Peace Treaty|Moscow Peace Treaty]] with the Soviet Union that laid out Lithuania's frontiers. This agreement gave Lithuanians control of the city of [[Vilnius]] ({{lang-lt|Vilnius}}, {{lang-pl|Wilno}}), the old Lithuanian capital, but a city with a majority Polish population.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=61}} This heightened tension between Lithuania and Poland and led to fears that they would resume the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian War]], and on 7 October 1920, the League negotiated the [[Suwa\u0142ki Agreement]] establishing a cease-fire and a demarcation line between the two nations.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}} On 9 October 1920, General [[Lucjan \u017beligowski]], commanding a Polish military force in contravention of the Suwa\u0142ki Agreement, took the city and established the [[Republic of Central Lithuania]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}}\n\nAfter a request for assistance from Lithuania, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=62}} This prompted the League to decide that the future of Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Union, which opposed any international force in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=63}} After unsuccessful proposals by [[Paul Hymans]] to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania, which was intended as a reincarnation of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|former union which both Poland and Lithuania]] had once shared before losing its independence, Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the [[Klaip\u0117da Region]], the [[Conference of Ambassadors|Allied Conference]] set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland, leaving Vilnius within Poland, on 14 March 1923.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=78\u201379}} Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=29}} It was not until the [[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania|1938 Polish ultimatum]] that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus ''de facto'' accepted the borders.{{sfn|Crampton|1996|p=93}}\n\n===Colombia and Peru===\n{{Main|Colombia\u2013Peru War|Leticia dispute}}\nThere were several border conflicts between [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]] in the early part of the 20th century, and in 1922, their governments signed the [[Salom\u00f3n-Lozano Treaty]] in an attempt to resolve them.{{sfn|Osmanczyk|Mango|2002|p=1314}} As part of this treaty, the border town of [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]] and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the [[Amazon River]].{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=249}} On 1 September 1932, business leaders from Peruvian rubber and sugar industries who had lost land, as a result, organised an armed takeover of Leticia.{{sfn|Bethell|1991|pp=414\u2013415}} At first, the [[Peruvian government]] did not recognise the military takeover, but [[President of Peru]] [[Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro|Luis S\u00e1nchez Cerro]] decided to resist a Colombian re-occupation. The [[Peruvian Army]] occupied Leticia, leading to an armed conflict between the two nations.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=250}} After months of diplomatic negotiations, the governments accepted mediation by the League of Nations, and their representatives presented their cases before the Council. A provisional peace agreement, signed by both parties in May 1933, provided for the League to assume control of the disputed territory while bilateral negotiations proceeded.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=251}} In May 1934, a final peace agreement was signed, resulting in the return of Leticia to Colombia, a formal apology from Peru for the 1932 invasion, demilitarisation of the area around Leticia, free navigation on the Amazon and [[Putumayo River]]s, and a pledge of [[non-aggression pact|non-aggression]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The verdict of the League|year=1934|editor=Hudson, Manley|publisher=World Peace Foundation|pages=1\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Saar===\n[[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] was a province formed from parts of Prussia and the [[Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate]] and placed under League control by the Treaty of Versailles. A plebiscite was to be held after fifteen years of League rule to determine whether the province should belong to Germany or France. When the referendum was held in 1935, 90.3 per cent of voters supported becoming part of Germany, which was quickly approved by the League Council.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=72\u201373}}{{sfn|Churchill|1986|p=98}}\n\n==Other conflicts==\nIn addition to territorial disputes, the League also tried to intervene in other conflicts between and within nations.

One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the [[Nansen passport]], which was the first internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/%28httpPages%29/03F1E1DD124D3276C1256F32002EE3AB?OpenDocument|accessdate=15 September 2011|title=The United Nations in the Heart of Europe|publisher=United Nations|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110132257/http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/03F1E1DD124D3276C1256F32002EE3AB?OpenDocument|archive-date=10 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greece and Bulgaria===\n{{Main|Incident at Petrich}}\nAfter an incident involving sentries on the Greek-Bulgarian border in October 1925, fighting began between the two countries.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=112}} Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria.

The report passed 42\u20131 in the Assembly in 1933 (only Japan voting against), but instead of removing its troops from China, Japan withdrew from the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=156\u2013161}} In the end,  as British historian [[Charles Mowat]] argued, collective security was dead:\n:The League and the ideas of collective security and the rule of law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.<ref>Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars 1918\u20131940'' (1955) p. 420.</ref>\n\n===Chaco War===\n{{Main|Chaco War}}\nThe League failed to prevent the 1932 war between [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] over the arid [[Gran Chaco]] region. Although the region was sparsely populated, it contained the [[Paraguay River]], which would have given either landlocked country access to the Atlantic Ocean,{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=242\u2013243}} and there was also speculation, later proved incorrect, that the Chaco would be a rich source of petroleum.{{sfn|Levy|2001|pp=21\u201322}} Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932 when the Bolivian army attacked the Paraguayans at Fort Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez at [[Lake Pitiantuta]].{{sfn|Bethell|1991|p=495}} Paraguay appealed to the League of Nations, but the League did not take action when the [[Pan-American Conference]] offered to mediate instead. The war was a disaster for both sides, causing 57,000 casualties for Bolivia, whose population was around three million, and 36,000 dead for Paraguay, whose population was approximately one million.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=248}} It also brought both countries to the brink of economic disaster.

On 5 October and later on 29 February 1936, the United States endeavoured, with limited success, to limit its exports of oil and other materials to normal peacetime levels.{{sfn|Baer|1976|p=71}} The League sanctions were lifted on 4 July 1936, but by that point, Italy had already gained control of the urban areas of Abyssinia.{{sfn|Baer|1976|p=298}}\n\nThe [[Hoare\u2013Laval Pact]] of December 1935 was an attempt by the British Foreign Secretary [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]] and the French Prime Minister [[Pierre Laval]] to end the conflict in Abyssinia by proposing to partition the country into an Italian sector and an Abyssinian sector. Mussolini was prepared to agree to the pact, but news of the deal leaked out. Both the British and French public vehemently protested against it, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia. Hoare and Laval were forced to resign, and the British and French governments dissociated themselves from the two men.{{sfn|Baer|1976|pp=121\u2013155}} In June 1936, although there was no precedent for a head of state addressing the Assembly of the League of Nations in person, Haile Selassie spoke to the Assembly, appealing for its help in protecting his country.<ref>{{cite web| author =Haile Selassie I| title =Appeal to The League of Nations:June 1936, Geneva, Switzerland| publisher =Black King| url =http://www.black-king.net/haile%20selassie%2001e.htm| accessdate =6 June 2008| url-status=dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080325023216/http://www.black-king.net/haile%20selassie%2001e.htm| archivedate =25 March 2008| df =dmy-all| author-link =Haile Selassie I}}</ref>\n\nThe Abyssinian crisis showed how the League could be influenced by the self-interest of its members;{{sfn|Baer|1976|p=303}} one of the reasons why the sanctions were not very harsh was that both Britain and France feared the prospect of driving Mussolini and [[Adolf Hitler]] into an alliance.{{sfn|Baer|1976|p=77}}\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\n{{Main|Spanish Civil War}}\nOn 17 July 1936, the [[Spanish Army]] launched a coup d'\u00e9tat, leading to a prolonged armed conflict between Spanish [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] (the elected leftist national government) and the Nationalists (conservative, anti-communist rebels who included most officers of the Spanish Army).{{sfn|Lannon|2002|pp=25\u201329}} [[Julio \u00c1lvarez del Vayo]], the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, appealed to the League in September 1936 for arms to defend Spain's territorial integrity and political independence. The League members would not intervene in the Spanish Civil War nor prevent foreign intervention in the conflict. [[Adolf Hitler]] and Mussolini continued to aid General [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalists, while the Soviet Union helped the Spanish Republic. In February 1937, the League did ban [[International Brigades|foreign volunteers]], but this was in practice a symbolic move.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=264\u2013265, 269\u2013270}}\n\n===Second Sino-Japanese War===\n{{Main|Second Sino-Japanese War}}\nFollowing a long record of instigating localised conflicts throughout the 1930s, Japan began a full-scale invasion of China on 7 July 1937. On 12 September, the Chinese representative, [[Wellington Koo]], appealed to the League for international intervention. Western countries were sympathetic to the Chinese in their struggle, particularly in their stubborn [[Battle of Shanghai|defence of Shanghai]], a city with a substantial number of foreigners.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=270}} The League was unable to provide any practical measures; on 4 October, it turned the case over to the [[Nine Power Treaty|Nine Power Treaty Conference]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The China White Paper|page=10|editor=van Slyke, Lyman|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/WorldWar2/china.htm|title=Japanese Attack on China 1937|accessdate=15 September 2011|publisher=Mount Holyoke University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831141400/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/WorldWar2/china.htm|archive-date=31 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Failure of disarmament==\n{{Further|World Disarmament Conference}}\nArticle 8 of the Covenant gave the League the task of reducing \"armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations\".<ref>{{cite web|last=League of Nations |year=1924 |title=The Covenant of the League of Nations:Article 8 |publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/leagcov.htm |accessdate=17 May 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415165629/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/leagcov.htm |archivedate=15 April 2016 |df= }}</ref> A significant amount of the League's time and energy was devoted to this goal, even though many member governments were uncertain that such extensive disarmament could be achieved or was even desirable.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=113, 123}} The Allied powers were also under obligation by the Treaty of Versailles to attempt to disarm, and the armament restrictions imposed on the defeated countries had been described as the first step toward worldwide disarmament.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=113, 123}} The League Covenant assigned the League the task of creating a disarmament plan for each state, but the Council devolved this responsibility to a special commission set up in 1926 to prepare for the 1932\u20131934 [[World Disarmament Conference]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=114}} Members of the League held different views towards the issue. The French were reluctant to reduce their armaments without a guarantee of military help if they were attacked; Poland and [[Czechoslovakia]] felt vulnerable to attack from the west and wanted the League's response to aggression against its members to be strengthened before they disarmed.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=173}} Without this guarantee, they would not reduce armaments because they felt the risk of attack from Germany was too great. Fear of attack increased as Germany regained its strength after the First World War, especially after Adolf Hitler gained power and became [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|German Chancellor in 1933]]. In particular, Germany's attempts to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German military made France increasingly unwilling to disarm.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=114}}\n\nThe [[World Disarmament Conference]] was convened by the League of Nations in Geneva in 1932, with representatives from 60 states. It was a failure.<ref>A.C. Temperley, ''The Whispering Gallery Of Europe'' (1938),  [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.216023  online]</ref> A one-year moratorium on the expansion of armaments, later extended by a few months, was proposed at the start of the conference.{{sfn|Goldblat|2002|p=24}} The Disarmament Commission obtained initial agreement from France, Italy, Spain, Japan, and Britain to limit the size of their navies but no final agreement was reached.  Ultimately, the Commission failed to halt the military build-up by Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan during the 1930s.\n\nThe League was mostly silent in the face of major events leading to the Second World War, such as Hitler's [[remilitarisation of the Rhineland]], occupation of the [[Sudetenland]] and ''[[Anschluss]]'' of [[Austria]], which had been forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, League members themselves re-armed. In 1933, Japan simply withdrew from the League rather than submit to its judgement,<ref>{{cite book|first=Meirion and Susie|last=Harries|title=Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army|page=163|isbn=978-0-394-56935-2|year=1991}}</ref> as did Germany the same year (using the failure of the World Disarmament Conference to agree to arms parity between France and Germany as a pretext), Italy and Spain in 1937.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=47, 133}} The final significant act of the League was to expel the Soviet Union in December 1939 after [[Winter War|it invaded Finland]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=273}}\n\n==General weaknesses==\n[[File:The Gap in the Bridge.png|thumb|'''The Gap in the Bridge'''; the sign reads \"This League of Nations Bridge was designed by the President of the U.S.A.\"\nCartoon from ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, 10 December 1920, satirising the gap left by the US not joining the League.]]\nThe onset of the Second World War demonstrated that the League had failed in its primary purpose, the prevention of another world war. There were a variety of reasons for this failure, many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation. Additionally, the power of the League was limited by the United States' refusal to join.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=276\u2013278}}\n\n===Origins and structure===\nThe origins of the League as an organisation created by the Allied powers as part of the peace settlement to end the First World War led to it being viewed as a \"League of Victors\".{{sfn|Gorodetsky|1994|p=26}}{{sfn|Raffo|1974|p=1}} The League's neutrality tended to manifest itself as indecision. It required a unanimous vote of nine, later fifteen, Council members to enact a resolution; hence, conclusive and effective action was difficult, if not impossible. It was also slow in coming to its decisions, as certain ones required the unanimous consent of the entire Assembly. This problem mainly stemmed from the fact that the primary members of the League of Nations were not willing to accept the possibility of their fate being decided by other countries, and by enforcing unanimous voting had effectively given themselves veto power.<ref>{{cite book|pages=226\u2013227|author=Birn, Donald S|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1981|title=The League of Nations Union|isbn=978-0-19-822650-5}}</ref>{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=279\u2013282, 288\u2013292}}\n\n===Global representation===\nRepresentation at the League was often a problem. Though it was intended to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their period of membership was short. The most conspicuous absentee was the United States. President Woodrow Wilson had been a driving force behind the League's formation and strongly influenced the form it took, but the US Senate voted not to join on 19 November 1919.{{sfn|Knock|1995|p=263}} [[Ruth Henig, Baroness Henig|Ruth Henig]] has suggested that, had the United States become a member, it would have also provided support to France and Britain, possibly making France feel more secure, and so encouraging France and Britain to co-operate more fully regarding Germany, thus making the rise to power of the [[Nazi Party]] less likely.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=175}} Conversely, Henig acknowledges that if the US had been a member, its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact economic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with [[international incident]]s.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=175}} The structure of the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] might also have made its membership problematic, as its representatives at the League could not have made decisions on behalf of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] without having the prior approval of the [[United States Congress|legislative branch]].{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=176}}\n\nIn January 1920, when the League was born, Germany was not permitted to join because it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War. [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] was also initially excluded because Communist regimes were not welcomed and membership would have been initially dubious due to the [[Russian Civil War]] in which both sides claimed to be the legitimate government of the country. The League was further weakened when major powers left in the 1930s. Japan began as a permanent member of the Council since the country was an Allied Power in the First World War, but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its occupation of Manchuria.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=62}} Italy began as a permanent member of the Council but withdrew in 1937 after roughly a year following the end of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]. Spain also began as a permanent member of the Council, but withdrew in 1939 after the [[Spanish Civil War]] ended in a victory for the Nationalists. The League had accepted Germany, also as a permanent member of the Council, in 1926, deeming it a \"peace-loving country\", but Adolf Hitler pulled Germany out when he came to power in 1933.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=69}}\n\n===Collective security===\nAnother important weakness grew from the contradiction between the idea of [[collective security]] that formed the basis of the League and [[international relations]] between individual states.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=253}} The League's collective security system required nations to act, if necessary, against states they considered friendly, and in a way that might endanger their [[national interest]]s, to support states for which they had no normal affinity.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=253}} This weakness was exposed during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], when Britain and France had to balance maintaining the security they had attempted to create for themselves in Europe \"to defend against the enemies of internal order\",{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=254}} in which Italy's support played a pivotal role, with their obligations to Abyssinia as a member of the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nOn 23 June 1936, in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain Italy's war against Abyssinia, the British Prime Minister, [[Stanley Baldwin]], told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that collective security had {{quote|failed ultimately because of the reluctance of nearly all the nations in Europe to proceed to what I might call military sanctions ... The real reason, or the main reason, was that we discovered in the process of weeks that there was no country except the aggressor country which was ready for war ... [I]f collective action is to be a reality and not merely a thing to be talked about, it means not only that every country is to be ready for war; but must be ready to go to war at once. That is a terrible thing, but it is an essential part of collective security.<ref name = \"events\" />}}\n\nUltimately, Britain and France both abandoned the concept of collective security in favour of [[appeasement]] in the face of growing German militarism under Hitler.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=74}}\nIn this context, the League of Nations was also the institution where the first international debate on terrorism took place following the 1934 assassination of [[King Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in [[Marseille]], [[France]], showing its conspiratorial features, many of which are detectable in the discourse of terrorism among states after [[9/11]].<ref>Ditrych, Ondrej.

[[Historical Social Research]] Vol. 38, 1 (2013).</ref>\n\nAmerican diplomatic historian [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]] originally supported the League,  but after two decades changed his mind:\n:The League of Nations has been a disappointing failure.... It has been a failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply sanctions except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.<ref>Quoted in Jerald A. Combs, 'American diplomatic history: two centuries of changing interpretations (1983) p 158.</ref>\n\n===Pacifism and disarmament===\nThe League of Nations lacked an armed force of its own and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to do.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|pp=54\u20135}} Its two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action on behalf of the League. Immediately after the First World War, [[pacifism]] became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservatives]] were especially tepid to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=238\u2013240}} Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, while at the same time advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nWhen the British cabinet discussed the concept of the League during the First World War, [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]], the [[Cabinet Secretary]], circulated a memorandum on the subject. He started by saying, \"Generally it appears to me that any such scheme is dangerous to us because it will create a sense of security which is wholly fictitious\".{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}} He attacked the British pre-war faith in the sanctity of treaties as delusional and concluded by claiming:\n\n{{quote|It [a League of Nations] will only result in failure and the longer that failure is postponed the more certain it is that this country will have been lulled to sleep. It will put a very strong lever into the hands of the well-meaning idealists who are to be found in almost every Government, who deprecate expenditure on armaments, and, in the course of time, it will almost certainly result in this country being caught at a disadvantage.{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}}}}\n\nThe Foreign Office civil servant Sir [[Eyre Crowe]] also wrote a memorandum to the British cabinet claiming that \"a solemn league and covenant\" would just be \"a treaty, like other treaties\". \"What is there to ensure that it will not, like other treaties, be broken?\" Crowe went on to express scepticism of the planned \"pledge of common action\" against aggressors because he believed the actions of individual states would still be determined by national interests and the balance of power. He also criticised the proposal for League economic sanctions because it would be ineffectual and that \"It is all a question of real military preponderance\". Universal disarmament was a practical impossibility, Crowe warned.{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}}\n\n==Demise and legacy==\n[[File:18-IV-1946.png|right|thumb|500px|World map showing [[member states of the League of Nations]] (in green and red) on 18 April 1946, when the League of Nations ceased to exist.]][[File:Humanit\u00e9s Num\u00e9riques.JPG|thumb|right|League of Nations archives, Geneva.<ref>League of Nations archives, United Nations Office in Geneva.

[[Covenant of the League of Nations]] was signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and it became effective together with the rest of the Treaty on 10 January 1920. The first meeting of the Council of the League took place on 16 January 1920, and the first meeting of Assembly of the League took place on 15 November 1920.\n\nThe diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious [[Allies of World War I|First World War Allies]] (France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Japan were the permanent members of the Executive Council) to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. The [[Great Power#Great powers at war|Great Powers]] were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting [[Red Cross]] medical tents, [[Benito Mussolini]] responded that \"the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldsite.transnational.org/Area_MiddleEast/2008/Jahanpour_SC-Iran.pdf|title=The Elusiveness of Trust: the experience of Security Council and Iran|accessdate=27 June 2008|publisher=Transnational Foundation of Peace and Future Research|last=Jahanpour|first=Farhang|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727102504/http://www.oldsite.transnational.org/Area_MiddleEast/2008/Jahanpour_SC-Iran.pdf|archive-date=27 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. After some notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the [[Axis powers]] in the 1930s. The credibility of the organization was weakened by the fact that the [[United States]] never joined the League and the [[Soviet Union]] joined late and was soon expelled after [[Winter War|invading Finland]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The participation of the Soviet Union in universal international organizations.: A political and legal analysis of Soviet strategies and aspirations inside ILO, UNESCO and WHO | author=Osakwe, C O | year=1972 | publisher=Springer | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2OmtJvNjHoC | page=5| isbn=978-9028600027 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Pericles, Lewis | year=2000 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | title=Modernism, Nationalism, and the Novel | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-ImKOwYvsoC | page=52| isbn=9781139426589 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Historical Dictionary of the League of Nations | author=Ginneken, Anique H.

By 1916 in Britain, the leader of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], and in the neutral United States, long-range thinkers had begun to design a unified international organisation to prevent future wars. Historian Peter Yearwood argues that when the new coalition government of [[Lloyd George ministry|David Lloyd George]] took power in December 1916, there was widespread discussion among intellectuals and diplomats of the desirability of establishing such an organisation. When Lloyd George was challenged by Wilson to state his position with an eye on the postwar situation, he endorsed such an organisation.  Wilson himself included in his [[Fourteen Points]] in January 1918 a \"league of nations to ensure peace and justice.\" British foreign secretary, [[Arthur Balfour]], argued that, as a condition of durable peace, \"behind international law, and behind all treaty arrangements for preventing or limiting hostilities, some form of international sanction should be devised which would give pause to the hardiest aggressor.\"<ref>Peter Yearwood, \"\u2018On the Safe and Right Lines\u2019: The Lloyd George Government and the Origins of the League of Nations, 1916\u20131918.\" ''Historical Journal'' 32#1 (1989): 131\u2013155.</ref>\n\nThe war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage.<ref>P.

Anti-war sentiment rose across the world; the First World War was described as \"[[The war to end war|the war to end all wars]]\",{{sfn|Archer|2001|p=14}} and its possible causes were vigorously investigated. The causes identified included arms races, alliances, militaristic nationalism, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit. One proposed remedy was the creation of an international organisation whose aim was to prevent future war through disarmament, open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage war, and penalties that made war unattractive.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=8}}\n\nIn London Balfour commissioned the first official report into the matter in early 1918, under the initiative of Lord [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Robert Cecil]].

Its constitution differed from that of the League: representation had been accorded not only to governments but also to representatives of employers' and workers' organisations.

The Committee's purpose was to conduct inquiries, oversee the operation of the League's health work, and prepare work to be presented to the Council.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=182}} This body focused on ending [[leprosy]], [[malaria]], and [[yellow fever]], the latter two by starting an international campaign to exterminate mosquitoes. The Health Organisation also worked successfully with the government of the Soviet Union to prevent [[typhus]] epidemics, including organising a large education campaign.{{sfn|Baumslag|2005|p=8}}\n\nThe League of Nations had devoted serious attention to the question of international intellectual co-operation since its creation.{{sfn|Grandjean|2018}} The First Assembly in December 1920 recommended that the Council take action aiming at the international organisation of intellectual work, which it did by adopting a report presented by the Fifth Committee of the Second Assembly and inviting a Committee on Intellectual Cooperation to meet in Geneva in August 1922. The French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] became the first chairman of the committee.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=186\u2013187}} The work of the committee included: inquiry into the conditions of intellectual life, assistance to countries where intellectual life was endangered, creation of national committees for intellectual co-operation, co-operation with international intellectual organisations, protection of intellectual property, inter-university co-operation, co-ordination of bibliographical work and international interchange of publications, and international co-operation in archaeological research.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=187\u2013189}}\n\nIntroduced by the second [[International Opium Convention]], the Permanent Central Opium Board had to supervise the statistical reports on trade in [[opium]], morphine, cocaine and heroin.

The League secured a commitment from [[Ethiopia]] to end slavery as a condition of membership in 1923, and worked with [[Liberia]] to abolish forced labour and intertribal slavery.

The first member to withdraw permanently from the League was [[Costa Rica]] on 22 January 1925; having joined on 16 December 1920, this also makes it the member to have most quickly withdrawn. Brazil was the first founding member to withdraw (14 June 1926), and [[Haiti]] the last (April 1942). [[Iraq]], which joined in 1932, was the first member that had previously been a [[League of Nations mandate]].{{sfn|Tripp|2002|p=75}}\n\nThe Soviet Union became a member on 18 September 1934,{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=312, 398}} and was expelled on 14 December 1939{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=312, 398}} for [[Winter War|invading Finland]]. In expelling the Soviet Union, the League broke its own rule: only 7 of 15 members of the Council voted for expulsion (United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Bolivia, Egypt, [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]), short of the majority required by the Covenant. Three of these members had been made Council members the day before the vote (South Africa, Bolivia, and Egypt).

The [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference]] adopted the principle that these territories should be administered by different governments on behalf of the League \u2013 a system of national responsibility subject to international supervision.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=192\u2013193}} This plan, defined as the [[League of Nations mandate|mandate system]], was adopted by the \"Council of Ten\" (the heads of government and foreign ministers of the main Allied powers: Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan) on 30 January 1919 and transmitted to the League of Nations.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=96|date=July 1921|title=The Mandate System of the League of Nations|pages=74\u201377|author=Myers, Denys P|doi=10.1177/000271622109600116|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1448676}}</ref>\n\nLeague of Nations mandates were established under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=193}} The Permanent Mandates Commission supervised League of Nations mandates,{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=198}} and also organised [[plebiscite]]s in disputed territories so that residents could decide which country they would join.

Fourteen mandate territories were divided up among seven mandatory powers: the United Kingdom, the Union of South Africa, France, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia and Japan.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=194\u2013195}} With the exception of the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], which joined the League on 3 October 1932,{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=216}} these territories did not begin to gain their independence until after the Second World War, in a process that did not end until 1990.

Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early [[interwar period]], the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered in its early years included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=70\u201372}}\n\nAs the League developed, its role expanded, and by the middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of international activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=170.}}\n\n===\u00c5land Islands===\n{{Main|\u00c5land crisis}}\n[[\u00c5land]] is a collection of around 6,500 islands in the Baltic Sea, midway between [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. The islands are almost exclusively [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking, but in 1809, the \u00c5land Islands, along with Finland, were taken by [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian [[October Revolution]], Finland declared its independence, but most of the \u00c5landers wished to rejoin Sweden.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=60}} The Finnish government considered the islands to be a part of their new nation, as the Russians had included \u00c5land in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], formed in 1809. By 1920, the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war. The British government referred the problem to the League's Council, but Finland would not let the League intervene, as they considered it an internal matter. The League created a small panel to decide if it should investigate the matter and, with an affirmative response, a neutral commission was created.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=60}} In June 1921, the League announced its decision: the islands were to remain a part of Finland, but with guaranteed protection of the islanders, including demilitarisation. With Sweden's reluctant agreement, this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=77\u201378}}\n\n===Upper Silesia===\nThe Allied powers referred the problem of [[Upper Silesia]] to the League after they had been unable to resolve the territorial dispute.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=82\u201383}} After the First World War, [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] laid claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of [[Prussia]]. The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|plebiscite in Upper Silesia]] to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland. Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two [[Silesian Uprisings]] (1919 and 1920). A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 per cent (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the [[Third Silesian Uprising]] in 1921.{{sfn|Osmanczyk|Mango|2002|p=2568}}\n\nOn 12 August 1921, the League was asked to settle the matter; the Council created a commission with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain to study the situation.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=88}} The committee recommended that Upper Silesia be divided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the plebiscite and that the two sides should decide the details of the interaction between the two areas \u2013 for example, whether goods should pass freely over the border due to the economic and industrial interdependence of the two areas.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=83}} In November 1921, a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five meetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany, but with the Polish section containing the majority of the region's mineral resources and much of its industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment was expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries. The settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second World War.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=88}}\n\n===Albania===\nThe frontiers of the [[Principality of Albania]] had not been set during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, as they were left for the League to decide; they had not yet been determined by September 1921, creating an unstable situation. [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greek]] troops conducted military operations in the south of Albania. [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, in the northern part of the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November 1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=103\u2013105}}\n\nThe borders of Albania again became the cause of international conflict when Italian General [[Enrico Tellini]] and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 24 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] was incensed and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days. Whatever the results of the investigation, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government pay Italy fifty million [[Italian lira|lire]] in reparations. The Greeks said they would not pay unless it was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=86}}\n\nMussolini sent a warship to shell the Greek island of [[Corfu]], and Italian forces [[Corfu incident|occupied the island]] on 31 August 1923. This contravened the League's covenant, so Greece appealed to the League to deal with the situation. The Allies agreed (at Mussolini's insistence) that the [[Conference of Ambassadors]] should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=87}} Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=110}}\n\n===Memel===\n{{Main|Klaip\u0117da Revolt}}\nThe port city of [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] (now [[Klaip\u0117da]]) and [[Klaip\u0117da Region|the surrounding area]], with a predominantly German population, was under provisional Entente control according to Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles. The French and Polish governments favoured turning Memel into an [[international city]], while [[Lithuania]] wanted to annex the area. By 1923, the fate of the area had still not been decided, prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and seize the port. After the Allies failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania, they referred the matter to the League of Nations. In December 1923, the League Council appointed a Commission of Inquiry. The commission chose to cede Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights. The [[Klaip\u0117da Convention]] was approved by the League Council on 14 March 1924, and then by the Allied powers and Lithuania.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=107}} In 1939 Germany retook the region following the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and an [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|ultimatum to Lithuania]], demanding the return of the region under threat of war.

According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|mandate over Iraq]] in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul did not want to be part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=133}} In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted the League of Nations' arbitration in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]], it rejected the decision, questioning the Council's authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admission.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=107\u2013108}}{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=131\u2013135}}\n\n===Vilnius===\n{{Main|\u017beligowski's Mutiny}}\nAfter the First World War, Poland and Lithuania both regained their independence but soon became immersed in territorial disputes.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}} During the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]], Lithuania signed the [[Soviet\u2013Lithuanian Peace Treaty|Moscow Peace Treaty]] with the Soviet Union that laid out Lithuania's frontiers. This agreement gave Lithuanians control of the city of [[Vilnius]] ({{lang-lt|Vilnius}}, {{lang-pl|Wilno}}), the old Lithuanian capital, but a city with a majority Polish population.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=61}} This heightened tension between Lithuania and Poland and led to fears that they would resume the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian War]], and on 7 October 1920, the League negotiated the [[Suwa\u0142ki Agreement]] establishing a cease-fire and a demarcation line between the two nations.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}} On 9 October 1920, General [[Lucjan \u017beligowski]], commanding a Polish military force in contravention of the Suwa\u0142ki Agreement, took the city and established the [[Republic of Central Lithuania]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}}\n\nAfter a request for assistance from Lithuania, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=62}} This prompted the League to decide that the future of Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Union, which opposed any international force in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=63}} After unsuccessful proposals by [[Paul Hymans]] to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania, which was intended as a reincarnation of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|former union which both Poland and Lithuania]] had once shared before losing its independence, Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the [[Klaip\u0117da Region]], the [[Conference of Ambassadors|Allied Conference]] set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland, leaving Vilnius within Poland, on 14 March 1923.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=78\u201379}} Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=29}} It was not until the [[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania|1938 Polish ultimatum]] that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus ''de facto'' accepted the borders.{{sfn|Crampton|1996|p=93}}\n\n===Colombia and Peru===\n{{Main|Colombia\u2013Peru War|Leticia dispute}}\nThere were several border conflicts between [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]] in the early part of the 20th century, and in 1922, their governments signed the [[Salom\u00f3n-Lozano Treaty]] in an attempt to resolve them.{{sfn|Osmanczyk|Mango|2002|p=1314}} As part of this treaty, the border town of [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]] and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the [[Amazon River]].{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=249}} On 1 September 1932, business leaders from Peruvian rubber and sugar industries who had lost land, as a result, organised an armed takeover of Leticia.{{sfn|Bethell|1991|pp=414\u2013415}} At first, the [[Peruvian government]] did not recognise the military takeover, but [[President of Peru]] [[Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro|Luis S\u00e1nchez Cerro]] decided to resist a Colombian re-occupation. The [[Peruvian Army]] occupied Leticia, leading to an armed conflict between the two nations.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=250}} After months of diplomatic negotiations, the governments accepted mediation by the League of Nations, and their representatives presented their cases before the Council. A provisional peace agreement, signed by both parties in May 1933, provided for the League to assume control of the disputed territory while bilateral negotiations proceeded.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=251}} In May 1934, a final peace agreement was signed, resulting in the return of Leticia to Colombia, a formal apology from Peru for the 1932 invasion, demilitarisation of the area around Leticia, free navigation on the Amazon and [[Putumayo River]]s, and a pledge of [[non-aggression pact|non-aggression]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The verdict of the League|year=1934|editor=Hudson, Manley|publisher=World Peace Foundation|pages=1\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Saar===\n[[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] was a province formed from parts of Prussia and the [[Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate]] and placed under League control by the Treaty of Versailles. A plebiscite was to be held after fifteen years of League rule to determine whether the province should belong to Germany or France. When the referendum was held in 1935, 90.3 per cent of voters supported becoming part of Germany, which was quickly approved by the League Council.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=72\u201373}}{{sfn|Churchill|1986|p=98}}\n\n==Other conflicts==\nIn addition to territorial disputes, the League also tried to intervene in other conflicts between and within nations. Among its successes were its fight against the international trade in opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926. One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the [[Nansen passport]], which was the first internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/%28httpPages%29/03F1E1DD124D3276C1256F32002EE3AB?OpenDocument|accessdate=15 September 2011|title=The United Nations in the Heart of Europe|publisher=United Nations|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110132257/http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/03F1E1DD124D3276C1256F32002EE3AB?OpenDocument|archive-date=10 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greece and Bulgaria===\n{{Main|Incident at Petrich}}\nAfter an incident involving sentries on the Greek-Bulgarian border in October 1925, fighting began between the two countries.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=112}} Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria.

They renamed the area [[Manchukuo]], and on 9 March 1932 set up a puppet government, with [[Pu Yi]], the former emperor of China, as its executive head.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=139}} This new entity was recognised only by the governments of Italy, Spain and Nazi Germany; the rest of the world still considered Manchuria legally part of China.\n\nThe League of Nations sent observers.

The report passed 42\u20131 in the Assembly in 1933 (only Japan voting against), but instead of removing its troops from China, Japan withdrew from the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=156\u2013161}} In the end,  as British historian [[Charles Mowat]] argued, collective security was dead:\n:The League and the ideas of collective security and the rule of law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.<ref>Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars 1918\u20131940'' (1955) p. 420.</ref>\n\n===Chaco War===\n{{Main|Chaco War}}\nThe League failed to prevent the 1932 war between [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] over the arid [[Gran Chaco]] region. Although the region was sparsely populated, it contained the [[Paraguay River]], which would have given either landlocked country access to the Atlantic Ocean,{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=242\u2013243}} and there was also speculation, later proved incorrect, that the Chaco would be a rich source of petroleum.{{sfn|Levy|2001|pp=21\u201322}} Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932 when the Bolivian army attacked the Paraguayans at Fort Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez at [[Lake Pitiantuta]].{{sfn|Bethell|1991|p=495}} Paraguay appealed to the League of Nations, but the League did not take action when the [[Pan-American Conference]] offered to mediate instead.

The League members would not intervene in the Spanish Civil War nor prevent foreign intervention in the conflict. [[Adolf Hitler]] and Mussolini continued to aid General [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalists, while the Soviet Union helped the Spanish Republic.

The French were reluctant to reduce their armaments without a guarantee of military help if they were attacked; Poland and [[Czechoslovakia]] felt vulnerable to attack from the west and wanted the League's response to aggression against its members to be strengthened before they disarmed.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=173}} Without this guarantee, they would not reduce armaments because they felt the risk of attack from Germany was too great. Fear of attack increased as Germany regained its strength after the First World War, especially after Adolf Hitler gained power and became [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|German Chancellor in 1933]]. In particular, Germany's attempts to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German military made France increasingly unwilling to disarm.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=114}}\n\nThe [[World Disarmament Conference]] was convened by the League of Nations in Geneva in 1932, with representatives from 60 states.

Ultimately, the Commission failed to halt the military build-up by Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan during the 1930s.\n\nThe League was mostly silent in the face of major events leading to the Second World War, such as Hitler's [[remilitarisation of the Rhineland]], occupation of the [[Sudetenland]] and ''[[Anschluss]]'' of [[Austria]], which had been forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, League members themselves re-armed.

There were a variety of reasons for this failure, many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation.

It required a unanimous vote of nine, later fifteen, Council members to enact a resolution; hence, conclusive and effective action was difficult, if not impossible. It was also slow in coming to its decisions, as certain ones required the unanimous consent of the entire Assembly. This problem mainly stemmed from the fact that the primary members of the League of Nations were not willing to accept the possibility of their fate being decided by other countries, and by enforcing unanimous voting had effectively given themselves veto power.<ref>{{cite book|pages=226\u2013227|author=Birn, Donald S|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1981|title=The League of Nations Union|isbn=978-0-19-822650-5}}</ref>{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=279\u2013282, 288\u2013292}}\n\n===Global representation===\nRepresentation at the League was often a problem. Though it was intended to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their period of membership was short. The most conspicuous absentee was the United States. President Woodrow Wilson had been a driving force behind the League's formation and strongly influenced the form it took, but the US Senate voted not to join on 19 November 1919.{{sfn|Knock|1995|p=263}} [[Ruth Henig, Baroness Henig|Ruth Henig]] has suggested that, had the United States become a member, it would have also provided support to France and Britain, possibly making France feel more secure, and so encouraging France and Britain to co-operate more fully regarding Germany, thus making the rise to power of the [[Nazi Party]] less likely.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=175}} Conversely, Henig acknowledges that if the US had been a member, its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact economic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with [[international incident]]s.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=175}} The structure of the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] might also have made its membership problematic, as its representatives at the League could not have made decisions on behalf of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] without having the prior approval of the [[United States Congress|legislative branch]].{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=176}}\n\nIn January 1920, when the League was born, Germany was not permitted to join because it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War. [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] was also initially excluded because Communist regimes were not welcomed and membership would have been initially dubious due to the [[Russian Civil War]] in which both sides claimed to be the legitimate government of the country. The League was further weakened when major powers left in the 1930s. Japan began as a permanent member of the Council since the country was an Allied Power in the First World War, but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its occupation of Manchuria.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=62}} Italy began as a permanent member of the Council but withdrew in 1937 after roughly a year following the end of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]. Spain also began as a permanent member of the Council, but withdrew in 1939 after the [[Spanish Civil War]] ended in a victory for the Nationalists. The League had accepted Germany, also as a permanent member of the Council, in 1926, deeming it a \"peace-loving country\", but Adolf Hitler pulled Germany out when he came to power in 1933.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=69}}\n\n===Collective security===\nAnother important weakness grew from the contradiction between the idea of [[collective security]] that formed the basis of the League and [[international relations]] between individual states.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=253}} The League's collective security system required nations to act, if necessary, against states they considered friendly, and in a way that might endanger their [[national interest]]s, to support states for which they had no normal affinity.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=253}} This weakness was exposed during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], when Britain and France had to balance maintaining the security they had attempted to create for themselves in Europe \"to defend against the enemies of internal order\",{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=254}} in which Italy's support played a pivotal role, with their obligations to Abyssinia as a member of the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nOn 23 June 1936, in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain Italy's war against Abyssinia, the British Prime Minister, [[Stanley Baldwin]], told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that collective security had {{quote|failed ultimately because of the reluctance of nearly all the nations in Europe to proceed to what I might call military sanctions ... The real reason, or the main reason, was that we discovered in the process of weeks that there was no country except the aggressor country which was ready for war ... [I]f collective action is to be a reality and not merely a thing to be talked about, it means not only that every country is to be ready for war; but must be ready to go to war at once. That is a terrible thing, but it is an essential part of collective security.<ref name = \"events\" />}}\n\nUltimately, Britain and France both abandoned the concept of collective security in favour of [[appeasement]] in the face of growing German militarism under Hitler.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=74}}\nIn this context, the League of Nations was also the institution where the first international debate on terrorism took place following the 1934 assassination of [[King Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in [[Marseille]], [[France]], showing its conspiratorial features, many of which are detectable in the discourse of terrorism among states after [[9/11]].<ref>Ditrych, Ondrej. '' 'International Terrorism' as Conspiracy: Debating Terrorism in the League of Nations''. [[Historical Social Research]] Vol. 38, 1 (2013).</ref>\n\nAmerican diplomatic historian [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]] originally supported the League,  but after two decades changed his mind:\n:The League of Nations has been a disappointing failure.... It has been a failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply sanctions except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.<ref>Quoted in Jerald A. Combs, 'American diplomatic history: two centuries of changing interpretations (1983) p 158.</ref>\n\n===Pacifism and disarmament===\nThe League of Nations lacked an armed force of its own and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to do.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|pp=54\u20135}} Its two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action on behalf of the League. Immediately after the First World War, [[pacifism]] became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservatives]] were especially tepid to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=238\u2013240}} Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, while at the same time advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nWhen the British cabinet discussed the concept of the League during the First World War, [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]], the [[Cabinet Secretary]], circulated a memorandum on the subject. He started by saying, \"Generally it appears to me that any such scheme is dangerous to us because it will create a sense of security which is wholly fictitious\".{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}} He attacked the British pre-war faith in the sanctity of treaties as delusional and concluded by claiming:\n\n{{quote|It [a League of Nations] will only result in failure and the longer that failure is postponed the more certain it is that this country will have been lulled to sleep. It will put a very strong lever into the hands of the well-meaning idealists who are to be found in almost every Government, who deprecate expenditure on armaments, and, in the course of time, it will almost certainly result in this country being caught at a disadvantage.{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}}}}\n\nThe Foreign Office civil servant Sir [[Eyre Crowe]] also wrote a memorandum to the British cabinet claiming that \"a solemn league and covenant\" would just be \"a treaty, like other treaties\". \"What is there to ensure that it will not, like other treaties, be broken?\" Crowe went on to express scepticism of the planned \"pledge of common action\" against aggressors because he believed the actions of individual states would still be determined by national interests and the balance of power. He also criticised the proposal for League economic sanctions because it would be ineffectual and that \"It is all a question of real military preponderance\". Universal disarmament was a practical impossibility, Crowe warned.{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}}\n\n==Demise and legacy==\n[[File:18-IV-1946.png|right|thumb|500px|World map showing [[member states of the League of Nations]] (in green and red) on 18 April 1946, when the League of Nations ceased to exist.]][[File:Humanit\u00e9s Num\u00e9riques.JPG|thumb|right|League of Nations archives, Geneva.<ref>League of Nations archives, United Nations Office in Geneva.

Current consensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its ultimate goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the [[rule of law]] across the globe; strengthened the concept of [[collective security]], giving a voice to smaller nations; helped to raise awareness to problems like [[epidemics]], [[slavery]], [[child labour]], colonial tyranny, [[refugee|refugee crises]] and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the [[mandate system]] put the colonial powers under international observation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pedersen|first1=Susan|title=Back to the League of Nations|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=112|issue=4|pages=1091\u20131117|date=October 2007|publisher=American Historical Review|jstor=40008445|doi=10.1086/ahr.112.4.1091}}</ref>\n\nProfessor [[David M.

He lived there with his parents, Ernest and Marie, and his brother Philippe and then at [[Boisguillaume]] in a two-storey house, \"one of those houses with exposed beams that tourists think are pretty but those who live there find uncomfortable.\"<ref name=anquetil>Anquetil, Jacques (1966): ''En br\u00fblant les \u00e9tapes'', Calmann-Levy, France</ref>\n\nIn 1941, his father refused contracts to work on military installations for the German occupiers and his work dried up. Other members of the family worked in strawberry farming and Anquetil's father followed them, moving to the hamlet of Bourguet, near [[Quincampoix]]. Anquetil had his first bicycle \u2013 an [[Alcyon]] \u2013 at the age of four and twice a day rode the kilometre and a half to the village and back. There he was taught by a teacher wearing clogs in a classroom heated by a smoking stove.<ref name=anquetil />\n\nAnquetil learned metal-turning at the technical college at [[Sotteville-l\u00e8s-Rouen]], a suburb of the city, where he played [[billiards]] with a friend named Maurice Dieulois. His friend joined the AC Sottevillais club with the encouragement of his father and began racing. Anquetil said: {{cquote|...[I] was impressed by the way girls were attracted to Dieulois because he had become a ''coureur cycliste'' ... so I gave up my first choice \u2013 running \u2013 and joined the club as well.\"<ref name=\"anquetil\" />}}\nHe was 17 and he took out his first racing licence on 2 December 1950. He stayed a member the rest of his life<ref name=\"velo\">L'Auto Cycle Sottevillais, ''V\u00e9lo'', France, November 2007</ref> and his grave in the churchyard at Quincampoix has a permanent tribute from his clubmates.\n\nAnquetil passed his qualifications in light engineering and went to work for 50 old francs a day at a factory in Sotteville. He left after 26 days following a disagreement with his boss over time off for training. The AC Sottevillais, founded in 1898, was run by a cycle-dealer, [[Andr\u00e9 Boucher]], who had a shop in the Place du Trianon in Sotteville.<ref name=\"velo\" /> The club had not just Anquetil but [[Claude LeBer]], who became professional pursuit champion in 1955, Jean Jourden, world amateur champion in 1961, and Francis Bazire, who came second in the world amateur championship in 1963.\n\nBoucher trained his group first from a bicycle and then by [[Derny]]. Anquetil made fast progress and won 16 times as an amateur. His first victory was the Prix Maurice Latour at [[Rouen]] on 3 May 1951. He also took the Prix de France in 1952 and the Tour de la Manche and the national road championship the same year.\n\n== The Grand Prix des Nations ==\nAnquetil rode in the French team in the 100&nbsp;km [[time trial]] at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]] and won a bronze medal.<ref name=\"sports-reference\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/an/jacques-anquetil-1.html |title=Jacques Anquetil Olympic Results |accessdate=28 December 2012 |work=sports-reference.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214112523/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/an/jacques-anquetil-1.html |archivedate=14 December 2012 }}</ref> Impressed by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9's progress, Andr\u00e9 Boucher sent an envelope of Anquetil's press cuttings to the local representative of the Perle bicycle company and asked him to send them to the firm's cycling team manager, the former [[Tour de France]] rider, [[Francis P\u00e9lissier]].<ref name=wood>Woodland, Les (2007) ''The Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France'', UK. {{ISBN|0224063189}}</ref>\n\nP\u00e9lissier called Anquetil, who was surprised and flattered to hear from him, and offered him 30,000 old francs a month to ride for La Perle as an independent, or semi-professional. Anquetil accepted and immediately ordered a new car, a [[Renault Fregate]], which he crashed twice in the first 12 months.<ref name=\"yates\">Yates, Richard (January 1997), ''Ma\u00eetre Jacques'', Cycle News, UK</ref>\n\nP\u00e9lissier wanted Anquetil for the 1953 [[Grand Prix des Nations]], a race started by the newspaper ''Paris-Soir'' which since 1932 had risen to the status of an unofficial world time-trial championship. It was held on a 142&nbsp;km loop of rolling roads through [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], [[Rambouillet]], [[Maulette]], [[St-R\u00e9my-les-Chevreuse]] and then back to Versailles before, originally, finishing on the Buffalo track in Paris.\n\nAnquetil was aware that one of his rivals was an Englishman named Ken Joy, who had broken records in Britain but was unknown in France. He would ride with another Englishman, Bob Maitland.<ref name=\"yates\" /> The historian Richard Yates says:\n\n<blockquote>Many of the 'against-the-clock' fraternity in the United Kingdom sincerely believed that the British time triallists were as good as, if not better than, their Continental counterparts and here was the chance to prove it. When the final result was known the British fans were disappointed and saw the race as a total failure for Britain as both Englishman had finished nearly 20 minutes down. To rub salt in the wounds, the event had been won by an unknown, curly-haired teenager from Normandy.<ref name=\"yates\" /></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil caught Joy \u2014 the moment he realised he was going to win the race<ref name=anquetil /> \u2014 even though Joy had started 16 minutes earlier. At 19, Anquetil had become unofficial time-trial champion of the world.\n\nThe win pleased P\u00e9lissier but did not convince him. Next year he drove his team car not behind Anquetil but his Swiss star, [[Hugo Koblet]]. Anquetil was not amused. When he beat Koblet, he sent his winner's bouquet to P\u00e9lissier's wife \"in deepest sympathy\".<ref name=anquetil />\n\nAnquetil rode the Grand Prix des Nations nine times without being beaten.\n\n== Hour record ==\n[[File:Anquetil memorial at Quincampoix 03.jpg|thumb|200px|Anquetil memorial at [[Quincampoix]]]]\nOn 22 September 1954, Anquetil started two years' compulsory service in the army, joining the Richepanse de Rouen barracks as a gunner of the 406th artillery regiment. The army accorded him few great favours but there was an exception:\n\n{{cquote|In June 1956, my chiefs finally gave me an order more to my liking, the strangest, the most unusual that a gunner has ever been asked to carry out; it was nothing less than to beat the world [[hour record]]. I knew what that meant: to storm a veritable fortress. For 14 years, since 7 November 1942, the date on which Fausto Coppi planted the Italian flag on it, it had discouraged all assailants. One figure sums up the difficulty of the enterprise: 45.848&nbsp;km.<ref name=anquetil />}}\n\nShould he break the record, he and the army agreed, he would give half the rewards to the army and the rest to the mother of a soldier, Andr\u00e9 Dufour, who had been killed while fighting at Palestro, in [[Algeria]].<ref name=Chany>Chany, Pierre (1988), ''La Fabuleuse Histoire de Cyclisme'', Nathan, France. {{ISBN|2092864319}}</ref> The chances of breaking it were far from guaranteed, not only because Coppi's record had already defied [[Gerrit Schulte]] and [[Louison Bobet]] but also Anquetil himself, on 23 November 1955, when he had started too fast, faded and finished 696&nbsp;m short of Coppi. His second attempt also flopped. He again started too fast. After 54:36 his helpers called him to a stop after 41.326&nbsp;km. His legs failed him when he got off his bike and he had to be carried to a chair in a corner of the [[Velodromo Vigorelli]], the [[velodrome]] in [[Milan]], Italy. The Italian crowd chanted: \"Coppi! Coppi! Coppi!\"<ref name=anquetil /><ref name=anquetil /><ref name=\"Chany\" />\n\n{{cquote|I was like a child's lead soldier that has lost its horse.\"<ref name=anquetil />}}\n\nNext day he received a telegram: \"Congratulations on a good performance. Sure of your success. Take your time. Captain Gueguen will arrive tomorrow with instructions. Signed: Commander Dieudonn\u00e9\".<ref name=\"Chany\" />\n\nAt 7:30pm on 29 June 1956, riding a lighter bike made in three days to the same design as Coppi's, and using a 7m40 gear (52x15), Anquetil tried again and finally broke his hero's record, riding 46.159&nbsp;km. Coppi was the first professional to give Anquetil his autograph.<ref>Interview, Magazine 24, ORTF (television), France, 20 November 1963</ref> When the two next met, Anquetil was also a professional. He went to Italy to meet Coppi and, for reasons never explained, dressed as a simple country boy rather than in the smart clothes that he normally wore.\n\n{{cquote|The grandstands fell quiet. They were preparing to take Coppi to the cemetery. I liked that silence. On the 84th lap, Boucher gave me my release. \"''Allez, m\u00f4me, tout''!\" [\"Go, kid, give it everything!\"] Until then I had been well within myself [''J'ai fum\u00e9 ma pipe'']... On a big school blackboard, Captain Gueguen wrote 46.159km. I could lift my arms, sit up and breathe a bit of fresh air. Ah, the public! Those who were whistling me four laps earlier kissed my bike, my jersey, reaching out to touch me in the way they do during processions of holy relics.<ref name=anquetil />}}\n\nIn 1967, 11 years later, Anquetil again broke the hour record, with 47.493&nbsp;km, but the record was disallowed because he refused to take the newly introduced post-race doping test.<ref name=Cycling /> He objected to what he saw as the indignity of having to urinate in a tent in a crowded velodrome and said he would take the test at his hotel. The international judge ruled against the idea and a scuffle ensued that involved Anquetil's manager, [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]]. ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' reported:<ref name=\"Cycling 7 Oct 1967\" />\n\n<blockquote>Wonderful Jacques Anquetil has broken the world hour record as he said he would... and then ran into official trouble when he refused to take a trackside dope test demanded by the Italian authorities. An Italian Dr Giuliano Marena asked for the urine sample, but Anquetil refused and asked him to come to his hotel. Dr Marena refused and, after waiting a couple of hours at the track, left town to go home to Florence. Anquetil said at his hotel: 'I didn't and don't intend to escape the test, but it must take place under circumstances far different from those at the velodrome. I'm still here and ready to undergo the test.' While Italian officials talked of taking the matter to the UCI, Dr Tanguy of the FFC [French cycling federation] took a sample from Anquetil on his return to Rouen, pointing out afterwards that it would be valid up to 48 hours after the record attempt. But Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani, his manager, had all but lost his temper with the Italian medical man and had tried to throw him out of the cabin, though Jacques had remonstrated mildly. Later he said that he understood the tests would be valid for up to 48 hours and said he was trying to locate another doctor for the test.<ref name=\"Cycling 7 Oct 1967\">Cycling, 7 October 1967, p. 4</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Tour de France ==\n[[File:Jacques Anquetil 1963.jpg|thumb|Anquetil at the [[1963 Tour de France]]]]\n[[File:Anquetil Poulidor Bahamontes 1964.jpg|thumb|Anquetil (center) at the [[1964 Tour de France]]]]\nIn 1957 Anquetil rode \u2013 and won \u2013 his first [[1957 Tour de France|Tour de France]]. His inclusion in the national team \u2013 the Tour was still ridden by national rather than commercial teams \u2013 was what the French broadcaster Jean-Paul Ollivier called \"a forceps operation\".<ref name=Ollivier>Ollivier, Jean-Paul (1999): ''Maillot Jaune'', Reader's Digest Selection, France</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[[Louison Bobet]] and [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]] wished to rule the Tour de France and had no desire to have Anquetil. But Louison, worn out from his battle of nerves that he suffered in the Tour of Italy, where he used all his energy in defending the ''maglia rosa'' [leader's jersey] against Italian hatred [''d\u00e9ferlante''], declared, on the banks of the Adriatic; \"I am not prepared, mentally, to take part in the Tour de France. I am 32 in a world of youth.\"<ref name=Ollivier /></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil recognised the allusion and accepted the invitation to ride. He finished nearly 15 minutes ahead of the rest, winning four stages and the team stage.\n\nIn 1959, Anquetil was whistled as he finished the Tour on the [[Parc des Princes]] because spectators calculated that he and others had contrived to let [[Federico Bahamontes]] win rather than the Frenchman [[Henry Anglade]]. The French team was unbalanced by internal rivalries. Anglade, whose bossy nature earned him the nickname [[Napoleon]], was unusual in that he was represented by the agent Roger Piel while the others had Daniel Dousset. The two men controlled French racing.<ref>''Dousset-Piel, l'Age de Bronze'', V\u00e9lo, France November 2005</ref> Dousset worked out that his riders had to beat Bahamontes or make sure that Anglade didn't win. Since they couldn't beat Anglade, they let Bahamontes win because Bahamontes, a poor rider on the flat and on small circuits, would be no threat to the post-Tour criterium fees that made up the bulk of riders' \u2014 and agents' \u2014 earnings.\n\nAnquetil was jeered and showed his coldness to public reaction by buying a boat that he named \"The Whistles of 59\" and by pointing out that he was a professional and that his first interest was money. It was an attitude that other riders understood but made him hard for fans to love .\n\nIn 1960 Anquetil stayed away from the Tour, returning in [[1961 Tour de France|1961]] and winning it thereafter until [[1964 Tour de France|1964]]. He won in [[1962 Tour de France|1962]] at a speed not bettered until [[1981 Tour de France|1981]]. He was the first to win four successive times, breaking the record of three set by [[Philippe Thys]] and [[Louison Bobet]]. He was first to win five times in total, since emulated by [[Eddy Merckx]], [[Bernard Hinault]] and [[Miguel Indurain]].\n\nIn 1963 Tour, at the top of a mountain, Anquetil faked a mechanical problem so that his team director could give him a bicycle more suitable for the descent. The plan worked and Anquetil overtook Bahamontes and won the stage, taking the lead.\n\nHis last Tour victory (in 1964) was his most famous, featuring an elbow-to-elbow duel with public favourite [[Raymond Poulidor]] on the road up the [[Puy-de-D\u00f4me (mountain)|Puy de D\u00f4me mountain]] on 12 July. Suffering indigestion after excesses on a rest day, Anquetil was said to have received a swallow of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] from his team manager \u2014 a story Anquetil's wife says is untrue.\n\nThe Tour organiser, [[Jacques Goddet]], was behind the pair as they turned off the main road and climbed through what the police estimated as half a million spectators. He recalled:\n\n<blockquote>The two, at the extreme of their rivalry, climbing the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman [Anquetil], used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to me, it was clear that Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly then he would have cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still think that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.<ref>Goddet, Jacques (1991): ''L'\u00c9quip\u00e9e Belle'', Robert Laffont, France</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil rode on the inside by the mountain wall while Poulidor took the outer edge by the precipice. They could sometimes feel the other's gasps on their bare arms. At the end, Anquetil cracked, after a battle of wills and legs so intense that at times they banged elbows. Of Anquetil, [[Pierre Chany]] wrote: <blockquote>\"His face, until then purple, lost all its colour; the sweat ran down in drops through the creases of his cheeks.\"<ref name=Chany /></blockquote> Anquetil was only semi-conscious, he said.<ref name=Chany /> Anquetil's manager, Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani, said:\n\n<blockquote>Anquetil's head was a computer. It started working: in 500 metres, Poulidor wouldn't get his 56 seconds. I'll never forget what happened when Jacques crossed the line. Close to fainting, he collapsed on the front of my car. With barely any breath left, exhausted, but 200 per cent lucid, he asked me: 'How much?' I told him 14 seconds. 'That's one more than I need. I've got 13 in hand'.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>In my opinion Poulidor was demoralised by Anquetil's resistance, his mental strength. There were three times when he could have dropped Anquetil. First, at the bottom of the climb. Then when Julio Jimenez attacked [and left the two Frenchmen, accompanied by the rival climber Federico Bahamontes]. Finally in the last kilometre. The nearer the summit came, the more Jacques was suffering. In the last few hundred metres, he was losing time. At the top of the Puy it's 13 per cent. Poulidor should have attacked: he didn't. Poulidor didn't attack in the last 500 metres \u2013 it was Jacques who got dropped, and that's not the same thing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}</blockquote>\n\nPoulidor gained time but Anquetil still had a 55-second lead in Paris and won his last Tour. The writer [[Chris Sidwells]] said:\n\n<blockquote>The race also ended the Anquetil era in Tour history. He could not face riding it the following year, and in 1966 he retired from the Tour with bad health \u2013 once he'd made sure that Poulidor could not win either.<ref group=\"n\">In 1966 Anquetil prevented Poulidor from winning the Tour by putting his team-mate Lucien Aimar in a position to win.</ref> Poulidor may not have managed to slay his dragon, in fact so bloodied was he by his battle that he never did win the Tour, but he did manage to wound his rival, and in so doing brought down the curtain on the rule of the first five-times winner \u2013 the first great super-champion of the Tour de France.<ref>[[Chris Sidwells|Sidwells, Chris]] (2003) ''Golden Stages of the Tour de France'', comp: Allchin, Richard and Bell, Adrian, Mousehold Press, UK</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil was first to win all three [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]]. He twice won the [[Giro d'Italia]] ([[1960 Giro d'Italia|1960]], [[1964 Giro d'Italia|1964]]) and won the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] once ([[1963 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1963]]). He also won the season-long ''[[Super Prestige Pernod International]]'' four times, in 1961, 1963, 1965 and 1966 \u2014 a record surpassed only by [[Eddy Merckx]].\n\n== Anquetil\u2013Poulidor: the social significance ==\n[[File:Poulidor.jpg|right|thumb|[[Raymond Poulidor]]]]\n\nAnquetil unfailingly beat [[Raymond Poulidor]] in the Tour and yet Poulidor remained more popular. Divisions between their fans became marked, which two sociologists studying the impact of the Tour on French society say became emblematic of France old and new. The extent of those divisions is shown in a story, perhaps apocryphal, told by [[Pierre Chany]], who was close to Anquetil:\n\n<blockquote>The Tour de France has the major fault of dividing the country, right down to the smallest hamlet, even families, into two rival camps. I know a man who grabbed his wife and held her on the grill of a heated stove, seated and with her skirts held up, for favouring Jacques Anquetil when he preferred Raymond Poulidor. The following year, the woman became a Poulidor-iste. But it was too late. The husband had switched his allegiance to Gimondi. The last I heard they were digging in their heels and the neighbours were complaining.<ref name=wood /></blockquote>\n\nJean-Luc Boeuf and Yves L\u00e9onard, in their study, wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Those who recognised themselves in Jacques Anquetil liked his priority of style and elegance in the way he rode. Behind this fluidity and the appearance of ease was the image of France winning and those who took risks identified with him. Humble people saw themselves in Raymond Poulidor, whose face \u2013 lined with effort \u2013 represented the life they led on land they worked without rest or respite. His declarations, full of good sense, delighted the crowds: a race, even a difficult one, lasts less time than a day bringing in the harvest. A big part of the public therefore finished by identifying with the one who symbolised bad luck and the eternal position of runner-up, an image that was far from true for Poulidor, whose record was particularly rich.<ref>The authors quote [[Milan\u2013San Remo]], the [[La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne]], the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] and [[Paris\u2013Nice]].</ref> Even today, the expression of the eternal second and of a Poulidor Complex is associated with a hard life, as an article by Jacques Marseille showed in ''Le Figaro'' when it was headlined \"This country is suffering from a Poulidor Complex\".<ref>''Le Monde'', 16 April 2002, supplement page 3</ref><ref>Boeuf, Jean Luc and L\u00e9onard Yves (2003), ''La R\u00e9publique du Tour de France'', Seuil, France. {{ISBN|202058073X}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Dauphin\u00e9 and Bordeaux\u2013Paris double ==\nIn 1965, Anquetil won the eight-day Alpine [[Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9]] Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 stage race at 3pm, sat through two hours of interviews and receptions, took a chartered flight in a French Mirage fighter plane (allegedly organised by President Charles de Gaulle, a big admirer of his) to [[Bordeaux]] at 6.30pm and won the world's longest single-day classic, [[Bordeaux\u2013Paris]], the following day. The race started at night and continued from after dawn behind [[derny]] motorcycle pacers.\n\nAnquetil was upset, said G\u00e9miniani, that Poulidor was always more warmly regarded even though he had never won the Tour. In 1965, when Poulidor was perceived to have received more credit for dropping Anquetil the previous year on the Puy-de-D\u00f4me than Anquetil had for winning the whole Tour, G\u00e9miniani persuaded him to ride the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 and, next day, Bordeaux\u2013Paris. That, he said, would end any argument over who was the greater.\n\nAnquetil won the Dauphin\u00e9, despite bad weather which he disliked, at 3pm. After two hours of interviews and receptions he flew from N\u00eemes to Bordeaux. At midnight, he ate his pre-race meal and went to the start in the city's northern suburbs.\n\nHe could eat little during the night because of stomach cramp and was on the verge of retiring. G\u00e9miniani swore and called him \"a great poof\" to offend his pride and keep him riding.<ref>{{YouTube|Oz7kIltIpsY}}</ref> Anquetil felt better as morning came and the riders dropped in behind the [[derny]] pacing motorcycles that were a feature of the race. He responded to an attack by [[Tom Simpson]], followed by his own team-mate [[Jean Stablinski]]. Anquetil and Stablinski attacked Simpson alternately, forcing Simpson to exhaust himself, and Anquetil won at the [[Parc des Princes]]. Stablinski finished 57 seconds later just ahead of Simpson.<ref>[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/veloarchive/exploits/65double.htm Anquetil's impossible double] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002194650/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/veloarchive/exploits/65double.htm |date=2 October 2007 }}. ntlworld.com</ref>\n\nThe historian Dick Yates said:\n<blockquote>It had been one of the hardest and closest [[derny]]-paced races in history but much more than that this double of Anquetil was one of the greatest exploits ever seen in cycling. At the [[Parc des Princes]], Anquetil received the biggest ovation of his career, certainly much bigger than after any of his wins in the Tour. The race record was broken, Jacques was mobbed by reporters and photographers but he was tired and really had to get some rest. Few people realised it at the time but he had to make the long journey to [[Maubeuge]] in north-eastern France where the following day he was riding a [[criterium]]!<ref name=\"CycNews'97 p19\">Cycling News, UK, December 1997, p. 19</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere are undenied rumours that the jet laid on to get Anquetil to Bordeaux was provided through state funds on the orders of [[President (government title)|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]]. G\u00e9miniani mentions the belief in his biography, without denying it, saying the truth will come out when state records are opened.\n\n== Trofeo Baracchi ==\nAnquetil's most humiliating race was the [[Trofeo Baracchi]] in Italy in 1962, when he had to be pushed by his partner, [[Rudi Altig]], and was so exhausted that he hit a pillar before reaching the track on which the race finished.\n\nThe Trofeo Baracchi was a 111&nbsp;km race for two-man teams. Anquetil, the world's best time-triallist, and Altig, a powerful rider with a strong sprint, were favourites. But things soon went wrong. The writer [[Ren\u00e9 de Latour]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I got my stopwatch going again to check the length of each man's turn at the front. Generally in a race of the Baracchi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints of no more than 300 yards. Altig was at the front when I started the check \u2014 and he was still there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn't even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through... Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things I have ever seen in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years' association with the sport \u2014 something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front \u2014 and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did this not just once but dozens of times.<ref>Sporting Cyclist, UK, undated cutting</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe pair reached the track on which the race finished. The timekeeper was at the entrance to the stadium, so Anquetil finished. But instead of turning on to the [[velodrome]], he rode straight on and hit a pole. He was helped away with staring eyes and with blood streaming from a cut to his head. The pairing nevertheless won by nine seconds.\n\n== Other races ==\nAnquetil was not as successful in the classic single-day races but towards the end of his career he won:\n* [[Gent\u2013Wevelgem]] (1964)\n* [[Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]] (1966)\n\nAnquetil finished in the top 10 in the [[world cycling championship|world championship]] on six occasions, but second place in 1966 was the nearest he came to the rainbow jersey.<ref name=\"sports-reference\" />\n\n== Riding style ==\nAnquetil was a smooth rider, a beautiful pedalling machine according to the American journalist Owen Mulholland:\n\n<blockquote>The sight of Jacques Anquetil on a bicycle gives credence to an idea we Americans find unpalatable, that of a natural aristocracy. From the first day he seriously straddled a top tube, \"Anq\" had a sense or perfection most riders spend a lifetime searching for. Between 1950, when he rode his first race, and nineteen years later, when he retired, Anquetil had countless frames underneath him, yet that indefinable poise was always there.<ref name=\"BikeRaceInfo\" /></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The look was that of a greyhound. His arms and legs were extended more than was customary in his era of pounded post World War II roads. And the toes pointed down. Just a few years before, riders had prided their ankling motion, but Jacques was the first of the big gear school. His smooth power dictated his entire approach to the sport. Hands resting serenely on his thin [[Mafac]] brake levers, the sensation from Quincampoix, Normandy, appeared to cruise while others wriggled in desperate attempts to keep up.<ref name=\"BikeRaceInfo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/riderhistories/Anquetil%20part%202.html|title=Bikerace Info, Rider database, Jacques Anquetil|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821072612/http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/riderhistories/Anquetil%20part%202.html|archivedate=21 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Physical attributes ==\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Height:\n| 1.76 m\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Weight:\n| {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}}<ref>These and other details published 1966 in ''En Br\u00fblant les \u00c9tapes'', Jacques Anquetil, published Calmann-Levy, France</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Chest:\n| 95&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Arm circumference:\n| 27&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Calf circumference:\n| 32&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Thigh circumference:\n| 47&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Foot size:\n| 41\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Lung capacity:\n| 6 litres\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Normal heart rate:\n| 48\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Heart rate after exercise:\n| 90\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Training:\n| 100\u2013120&nbsp;km, three times a week\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Gym training:\n| 20 minutes, twice a week\n|-\n!! style=\"text-align:right\"|Diet:\n| No restrictions other than sauces.

Dick Yates wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Rapha\u00ebl embarked on a policy of trying to convince Jacques of the need to win more races as he certainly had the ability to do so... Anquetil had a very strong personality so he was not easily dominated but G\u00e9miniani had an even stronger one. He never gave up the task of trying to convince Jacques of the need for more panache, how a man of his talent should have an even bigger list of important wins.<ref name=\"CycNews'97 p19\" /></blockquote>\n\nAs a partnership they won four Tours de France, two Giro d'Italia, the [[Dauphin\u00e9-Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]] and then next day, [[Bordeaux\u2013Paris]]. G\u00e9miniani said of him:\n<blockquote>Today, everybody pays him homage. I nearly blow my top. I can still hear the way he was whistled when he rode. I think of the organisers of the Tour, who shortened the time trial<ref group=\"n\">Anquetil was the dominant time-triallist of his period</ref> to make him lose. His home town of [[Rouen]] organises commemorations but, me, I haven't forgotten that it was in [[Antwerp]] that he made his farewell appearance. More than once, I saw him crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a [[Amateur|dilettante]]. The truth is that Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered as though he was damned. He wasn't a climber. But with bluffing, with guts, he tore them to shreds (''il les a tous couillonn\u00e9s'').<ref>L'Express 19 June 2003</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Honours ==\nAnquetil was named France's champion of champions by [[L'\u00c9quipe]] in 1963. He was appointed Chevalier de l'[[Ordre national du M\u00e9rite]] in 1965 (cross of merit) and Chevalier de la [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] on 5 October 1966.\n\n== Personal life ==\nAnquetil was fascinated by astronomy and was delighted to meet [[Yuri Gagarin]]. The rational side of his character contrasted with his superstition. In the [[1964 Tour de France]], a fortune-teller called Belline predicted in [[France-Soir]] that Anquetil would die on or around the 13th day of the race. His wife Janine, knowing Anquetil's superstition, hid the paper but Anquetil found out, not least because he was sent cuttings with unsigned letters.<ref name=letour>Le Tour de France, Jean-Paul Brouchon, Balland-Jacob-Duvernet, 2000</ref>\n\nJean-Paul Brouchon, leading cycling commentator at the news radio station France-Info, said of the day the forecast was supposed to come true:\n\n<blockquote>During those dark hours, Anquetil refused to leave his room [the race was having a rest day]. Finally he agreed to go for a short car ride with [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]] [his team manager] and Janine, to join a party organised by Radio Andorra.<ref name=letour /></blockquote>\n\nA mixture of Anquetil's fear for the future and his enjoyment of living in the present led to newspaper pictures of the large meal and the wine that he drank that day. Next morning, still worried about the prediction and laden down by partying, he was dropped on the first hairpins of the [[Port d'Envalira]].\n\nHe was famous for preparing for races by staying up all night drinking and playing cards, although the story seems to have increased with the telling. Nevertheless, his teammate, the British rider [[Vin Denson]], has written in ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' of exuberant parties during races. Denson has written, too, of Anquetil's scrupulous business arrangements with riders and others:\n\n<blockquote>I always considered Jacques to be the very best professional\", he said. \"I admired him for the gentlemanly manner and charm with riders, the public and media. A more honest and sincere businessman and friend you would not find in any walk of life. His word was his all and was of great importance to him. He was a truly great man and champion who will be greatly missed and impossible to replace.<ref name=Cycling>''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' 26 November 1987</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe British journalist Alan Gayfer, former editor of [[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]] said:\n\n<blockquote>Jacques was a real Norman with the nuances of speech that make the Normans famous, they almost say Yes to mean No, and vice versa. I asked him when he was in London if Poulidor, who was often second to Jacques, could ever win the Tour de France: \"Yes\", he said, \"but only if I am riding, and I would always finish ahead of him.<ref name=Cycling /></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>But perhaps my finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]], where a German official had been particularly rude to myself and other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike from the back of the car. Yes, he did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, walked over to the riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall ever see, and for that I shall remember Jacques for a long time.<ref name=Cycling /></blockquote>\n\nDick Yates said:\n<blockquote>\"He had a deep love of the land and was at his happiest when driving a tractor. They [his wife and he] both acquired a taste for bridge parties which often continued late into the night. That Anquetil was a highly intelligent man there can be no doubt and he was the nearest thing to a true intellectual that cycling has ever produced.\"<ref>Cycling News, UK, December 1999, p20</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil married Janine Boeda on 22 December 1958. She had been married to Anquetil's doctor. The doctor, seeing a rival, sent his wife to live with friends.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\">Anquetil le Sultan, Nouvel Observateur, France, 29 April 2004</ref> Anquetil went to see her, disguised as a plumber,<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> and took her to Paris to buy clothes in the [[Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9]].<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />\n\nTheir marriage produced no children. Janine had two children, Alain and Annie, from her previous marriage. Janine had two failed pregnancies and Anquetil grew upset in 1970 that he was not a father.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> The couple considered a surrogate mother before Janine thought of her daughter, Annie. Janine said: \"We didn't use the parental authority that we could have had over her. It was a request that I addressed to her. Gently. Annie always had the choice of refusing.\"<ref group=\"n\">''Non; nous n'avons pas abus\u00e9 de l'ascendant que nous pouvions sur elle. C'est une pri\u00e8re que je lui ai adresse\u00e9e. Gentiment.

Anquetil le Sultan, Nouvel Observateur, France, 29 April 2004</ref> Annie confirmed her mother's recollection.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> She said:\n\n{{cquote|When my mother asked that [I should become impregnated by my step-father, Anquetil]....

And I knew that I pleased him. What do you expect? That's life. And that's how I found myself in his bed in the sacred mission of procreation.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />}}\n\nAnquetil, his wife and his wife's daughter began a ''[[m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]]''<ref>Anquetil, Sophie (2004) ''Pour l'Amour de Jacques'', Grasset, France</ref> Annie said:\n{{cquote|\"Nobody thought it strange that Jacques Anquetil joined me in my bed each evening before returning to the marital bed beside my mother. Everybody was comfortable with it [''Tout le monde \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'aise''].\"<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />}}\n\nAnnie said she should have left the house after her daughter, Sophie, was born (in 2004, Sophie Anquetil published the book ''Pour l'amour de Jacques'' in which she confirmed what had been rumoured but what Anquetil had always tried to hide:<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> that she was Anquetil's daughter). Instead, she grew jealous of her own mother and demanded she leave instead.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> When Janine refused, Annie left. To fill the gap, Janine invited her son, Alain, and his wife, Dominique, to return to live there. Anquetil began an affair with Dominique, to make Annie jealous.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> Dominique had Anquetil's child but Annie still refused to return. Dominique still lives in the house, ''Les Elfes'', where she organises conferences.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> Janine and Anquetil divorced. Sophie moved in with Janine, although she lives now in [[Calenzana]], near [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]].<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> Both Janine and Dominique wrote their life story: neither mentioned the link between Sophie and Anquetil.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />\n\n== Doping ==\nAnquetil never hid that he took drugs and in a debate with a government minister on French television said only a fool would imagine it was possible to ride Bordeaux\u2013Paris on just water. He and other cyclists had to ride through \"the cold, through heatwaves, in the rain and in the mountains\", and they had the right to treat themselves as they wished, he said, before adding: \"Leave me in peace; everybody takes dope.\"<ref>Cited in ''Les Miroirs du Tour'', French television, 2003</ref> There was implied acceptance of doping right to the top of the state: [[Charles de Gaulle]] said: \"Doping? What doping? Did he or did he not make them play the [[Marseillaise]] [the national anthem] abroad?\"<ref>Cited ''L'\u00c9quipe Magazine'' 23 July 1994</ref>\n\nAnquetil won [[Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]] in 1966.  An official named Collard told him there would be a drugs test once he had got changed. \"Too late\", Anquetil said. \"If you can collect it from the soapy water there, go ahead. I'm a human being, not a fountain.\" Collard said he would return half an hour later; Anquetil said he would have left for a dinner appointment 140&nbsp;km away. Two days later the Belgian cycling federation disqualified Anquetil and fined him. Anquetil responded by calling urine tests \"a threat to individual liberty\" and engaged a lawyer. The case was never heard, the Belgians backed down and Anquetil became the winner.\n\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=25%|quote=Jacques had the strength \u2013 for which he was always criticised \u2013 to say out loud what others would only whisper. So, when I asked him 'What have you taken?' he didn't drop his eyes before replying.

But the argument found less support as more riders were reported to have died or suffered health problems through drug-related incidents, including the [[death of Tom Simpson]], in the 1967 Tour de France.<ref name=Cycling />\n\nHowever, there was great support in the cyclist community for Anquetil's argument that, if there were to be rules and tests, the tests should be carried out consistently and with dignity. He said it was professional dignity, the right of a champion not to be ridiculed in front of his public, that led to his refusal to take a test in the centre of the Vigorelli track after breaking the world hour record.\n\nThe unrecognised time that Anquetil set that day was nevertheless broken by the Belgian rider [[Ferdinand Bracke]]. Anquetil was hurt that the French government had never sent him a telegram of congratulations but sent one to Bracke, who was not French. It was a measure of the unacceptability of Anquetil's arguments, as was the way he was quietly dropped from future French teams.\n\n== Anquetil and Britain ==\nBritish fans voted Anquetil the [[BBC]]'s international personality of 1964. He appeared with [[Tom Simpson]] from a studio in Paris. The Franco-American journalist [[Ren\u00e9 de Latour]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>In the studio we watched the proceedings in London, and while I cannot say Anquetil was keenly interested in the cricketing part, he was impressed with the general presentation which, however (like the stages of the 1964 Tour) he found a bit long. He was interested, though, to see [[Beryl Burton]], and his old acquaintance [[Reg Harris]] pulling at his pipe in the invited audience.<ref>''Sporting Cyclist'', UK, 1965</ref></blockquote>\n\nA few days later, Anquetil was named French sportsman of the year.\n\nAnquetil was fascinated by British enthusiasm for time-trialling and in 1961 presented prizes at the [[Road Time Trials Council]] evening at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] to honour [[Beryl Burton]] and Brian Kirby.<ref name=Cycling /> The pair had won the women's and men's [[British Best All-Rounder]] competitions (BBAR) for, respectively, the highest average speed in a season over 25, 50 and 100 miles (women) and 50 and {{convert|100|mi|km}} and 12 hours (men).\n\nAlan Gayfer, the editor of ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' at the time of Anquetil's death, wrote in appreciation:\n<blockquote>It is strange to look back and see how this frail-looking young man burst on the scene in 1953. We had sent Ken Joy, the former BBAR, to challenge for the Grand Prix des Nations, then 140 kilometres long, and dragging through the hills of the Chevreuse valley. All over Paris they talked about this burly Englishman who had ridden 160&nbsp;km in 4 hours and 6 minutes: and when it came to it, he was hammered by a 19-year-old, but a teenager with a will of iron that was to prove inflexible for the next 19 years.<ref name=Cycling /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1964 Anquetil discussed riding a British 25&nbsp;mile (40&nbsp;km) race. Gayfer and Tom Simpson explained that the course would be flat and asked Anquetil how long the distance would take him. Anquetil, who could predict his time-trial times accurately, said 46 minutes. That was eight minutes faster than the British record standing to Bas Breedon at 54:23. It took until 1993 for the record to fall below Anquetil's estimation.\n\nAnquetil asked \u00a31,000 to compete and a London timber merchant called Vic Jenner said he would put up the money. Jenner had often put money into the sport. He died shortly afterwards, however, and the ride never happened.<ref>Cited \"Cycling: the golden years\", Springfield Press, UK</ref>\n\nAnquetil took part, with Simpson, in an afternoon of exhibition racing at the Herne Hill track in South London, on 13 June 1964 \u2013 three weeks before starting in the 1964 Tour de France.\n\nAnquetil rode on the [[Isle of Man]] in 1959, 1962 and in 1965, when he won the [[Manx Trophy|Manx Premier]] by beating [[Eddy Merckx]] into second place.<ref name=Cycling />\n\n== Retirement and death ==\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teaufort 78 Anquetil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A memorial plaque to Anquetil in [[Ch\u00e2teaufort, Yvelines|Ch\u00e2teaufort]], France]]\n[[File:Anquetil's memorial at Quincampoix.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A memorial to Anquetil in [[Quincampoix]], France]]\nAnquetil rode his last race not in France, of which he still despaired for its preferring Poulidor, but on 27 December 1969 on the track at [[Antwerp]]. It happened, wrote ''L'\u00c9quipe'' \"to the great indifference of the media.\"<ref group=\"n\">L'\u00c9quipe said Anquetil's  farewell race was in Charleroi. Other reports agree that it was Antwerp.</ref> He retired to a farm at Le Domaine des Elfes, [[La Neuville-Chant-d'Oisel]], 17&nbsp;km from Rouen. The ch\u00e2teau, formerly owned by [[Guy de Maupassant]], was surrounded by 170 hectares.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />\n\nAnquetil was a correspondent for L'\u00c9quipe, consultant for [[Europe 1]] and then on Antenne 2, a race director for [[Paris\u2013Nice]] and the [[Tour M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en]] and in Canada, [[directeur sportif]] of French teams at world championships,<ref name=Cycling /> and a member of the managing committee of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Cyclisme]]. His radio analyses were sharp and he gained notoriety in Belgium for telling [[Luis Oca\u00f1a]], the Spanish rider living in France, how to beat Eddy Merckx.\n\nHe rode his bike only three times in retirement, saying he had already ridden enough. He rode the Grand Prix des Gentlemen in [[Nice]], a race in which old riders were paired with current competitors; he went out for an afternoon with friends in Normandy; and he joined his daughter for a bike ride on her birthday. Other than that, he did not ride his bike after 1969.\n\nOn 18 November 1987, Jacques Anquetil died of [[stomach cancer]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclinghalloffame.com/riders/rider_bio.asp?rider_id=25|title=Cycling Hall of Fame.com|website=www.cyclinghalloffame.com}}</ref> in his sleep at 6{{nbsp}}am at the St-Hilaire Clinic in [[Rouen]]. He had been there since 10 October. The clinic said: \"His state of health had visibly deteriorated over the last hours and he died in his sleep after showing great courage throughout his illness.\"<ref name=Cycling /> Anquetil is buried beside the church in Quincampoix, north of Rouen, where a large black monument by the traffic lights lists his achievements. There is a further monument at the Piste Municipale in Paris, where the centre is named after him.\n\nThe Jacques Anquetil sports stadium at Quincampoix was dedicated in 1983. There are moves to open a museum in his memory.\n\nThe historian Richard Yates wrote:\n[[File:Anquetil's grave at Quincampoix.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Anquetil's grave at Quincampoix, France]]\n<blockquote>He finally came to be respected as one of the most intelligent cyclists ever, but when he died in 1987 he was still to a large extent one of cycling's greatest enigmas. Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani knew him better than anyone and he was such a perceptive man that his comments are particularly interesting. He said that Jacques was one of the most gifted riders of all time but this was hardly reflected by his record. He had won eight major Tours without once crossing the top of a mountain in the lead. His lack of offensive spirit made G\u00e9miniani mad with rage on countless occasions but he was always so incredibly stylish, absolute perfection.<ref name=\"yates\" /></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>His inherent shyness can never fully explain his apparent cold indifference. His roots in the Normandy countryside may explain his love of the land but could not excuse his inability to even make a generous gesture. The hard life that his father had experienced could never pardon the economy of effort with which Jacques was obsessed. In the second half of his career he never made an effort which did not pay off 100 per cent. He reduced a race to a few simple calculations, a few danger men and a few places where it was necessary to make an effort. He spent most of the time at the back of the bunch and did not even know the name of most of the riders.<ref name=\"yates\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe Tour visited Rouen on the 10th anniversary of Anquetil's death. There to remember his first victory in the race were his team-mates, Gilbert Bauvin, Louis Bergard, [[Albert Bouvet]], [[Andr\u00e9 Darrigade]], Jean Forestier, [[Andr\u00e9 Mah\u00e9]], Ren\u00e9 Privat and [[Jean Stablinski]]. There, too, was the team car from Anquetil's first Tour, driven by the man behind the wheel that year, William Odin.<ref>Cycling, \"Anquetil anniversary celebrations\", 5 July 1997</ref>\n\n== Popular culture ==\nAnquetil made an appearance in cartoon form in the animated movie ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]] (Les Triplettes de Belleville)'' (''Belleville Rendez-vous'' in the British release).\n\nThe French film ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' may contain an indirect reference to Anquetil.  A long-lost box of souvenirs found by Am\u00e9lie reminds an ageing estranged father of the time he cheered [[Federico Bahamontes]]' win of the 1959 Tour (Anquetil, a long-time rival of Bahamontes, came third). Am\u00e9lie is later romantically pursued by Nino Quincampoix, who shares a rare surname with the village where Anquetil is buried.\n\n==Career achievements==\n===Major results===\n\nSource:<ref

and the first cyclist to win the  [[Tour de France]] five times, in 1957 and from 1961 to 1964.<ref name=\"sports-reference\" />\n\nHe stated before the 1961 Tour that he would gain the yellow jersey on day one and wear it all through the tour, a tall order with two previous winners in the field\u2014[[Charly Gaul]] and [[Federico Bahamontes]]\u2014but he did it.<ref group=\"n\">Anquetil took the yellow jersey after the second half-stage (time trial) of the first day, Darrigade having won the first half-stage.</ref> His victories in stage races such as the Tour were built on an exceptional ability to ride alone against the clock in [[individual time trial]] stages, which lent him the name '''\"Monsieur Chrono\"'''.\n\n== Early life ==\nAnquetil was the son of a builder in [[Mont-Saint-Aignan]], in the hills above [[Rouen]] in [[Normandy]], north-west France. He lived there with his parents, Ernest and Marie, and his brother Philippe and then at [[Boisguillaume]] in a two-storey house, \"one of those houses with exposed beams that tourists think are pretty but those who live there find uncomfortable.\"<ref name=anquetil>Anquetil, Jacques (1966): ''En br\u00fblant les \u00e9tapes'', Calmann-Levy, France</ref>\n\nIn 1941, his father refused contracts to work on military installations for the German occupiers and his work dried up. Other members of the family worked in strawberry farming and Anquetil's father followed them, moving to the hamlet of Bourguet, near [[Quincampoix]]. Anquetil had his first bicycle \u2013 an [[Alcyon]] \u2013 at the age of four and twice a day rode the kilometre and a half to the village and back. There he was taught by a teacher wearing clogs in a classroom heated by a smoking stove.<ref name=anquetil />\n\nAnquetil learned metal-turning at the technical college at [[Sotteville-l\u00e8s-Rouen]], a suburb of the city, where he played [[billiards]] with a friend named Maurice Dieulois. His friend joined the AC Sottevillais club with the encouragement of his father and began racing. Anquetil said: {{cquote|...[I] was impressed by the way girls were attracted to Dieulois because he had become a ''coureur cycliste'' ... so I gave up my first choice \u2013 running \u2013 and joined the club as well.\"<ref name=\"anquetil\" />}}\nHe was 17 and he took out his first racing licence on 2 December 1950. He stayed a member the rest of his life<ref name=\"velo\">L'Auto Cycle Sottevillais, ''V\u00e9lo'', France, November 2007</ref> and his grave in the churchyard at Quincampoix has a permanent tribute from his clubmates.\n\nAnquetil passed his qualifications in light engineering and went to work for 50 old francs a day at a factory in Sotteville. He left after 26 days following a disagreement with his boss over time off for training. The AC Sottevillais, founded in 1898, was run by a cycle-dealer, [[Andr\u00e9 Boucher]], who had a shop in the Place du Trianon in Sotteville.<ref name=\"velo\" /> The club had not just Anquetil but [[Claude LeBer]], who became professional pursuit champion in 1955, Jean Jourden, world amateur champion in 1961, and Francis Bazire, who came second in the world amateur championship in 1963.\n\nBoucher trained his group first from a bicycle and then by [[Derny]]. Anquetil made fast progress and won 16 times as an amateur. His first victory was the Prix Maurice Latour at [[Rouen]] on 3 May 1951. He also took the Prix de France in 1952 and the Tour de la Manche and the national road championship the same year.\n\n== The Grand Prix des Nations ==\nAnquetil rode in the French team in the 100&nbsp;km [[time trial]] at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]] and won a bronze medal.<ref name=\"sports-reference\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/an/jacques-anquetil-1.html |title=Jacques Anquetil Olympic Results |accessdate=28 December 2012 |work=sports-reference.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214112523/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/an/jacques-anquetil-1.html |archivedate=14 December 2012 }}</ref> Impressed by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9's progress, Andr\u00e9 Boucher sent an envelope of Anquetil's press cuttings to the local representative of the Perle bicycle company and asked him to send them to the firm's cycling team manager, the former [[Tour de France]] rider, [[Francis P\u00e9lissier]].<ref name=wood>Woodland, Les (2007) ''The Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France'', UK. {{ISBN|0224063189}}</ref>\n\nP\u00e9lissier called Anquetil, who was surprised and flattered to hear from him, and offered him 30,000 old francs a month to ride for La Perle as an independent, or semi-professional. Anquetil accepted and immediately ordered a new car, a [[Renault Fregate]], which he crashed twice in the first 12 months.<ref name=\"yates\">Yates, Richard (January 1997), ''Ma\u00eetre Jacques'', Cycle News, UK</ref>\n\nP\u00e9lissier wanted Anquetil for the 1953 [[Grand Prix des Nations]], a race started by the newspaper ''Paris-Soir'' which since 1932 had risen to the status of an unofficial world time-trial championship. It was held on a 142&nbsp;km loop of rolling roads through [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], [[Rambouillet]], [[Maulette]], [[St-R\u00e9my-les-Chevreuse]] and then back to Versailles before, originally, finishing on the Buffalo track in Paris.\n\nAnquetil was aware that one of his rivals was an Englishman named Ken Joy, who had broken records in Britain but was unknown in France. He would ride with another Englishman, Bob Maitland.<ref name=\"yates\" /> The historian Richard Yates says:\n\n<blockquote>Many of the 'against-the-clock' fraternity in the United Kingdom sincerely believed that the British time triallists were as good as, if not better than, their Continental counterparts and here was the chance to prove it. When the final result was known the British fans were disappointed and saw the race as a total failure for Britain as both Englishman had finished nearly 20 minutes down. To rub salt in the wounds, the event had been won by an unknown, curly-haired teenager from Normandy.<ref name=\"yates\" /></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil caught Joy \u2014 the moment he realised he was going to win the race<ref name=anquetil /> \u2014 even though Joy had started 16 minutes earlier. At 19, Anquetil had become unofficial time-trial champion of the world.\n\nThe win pleased P\u00e9lissier but did not convince him. Next year he drove his team car not behind Anquetil but his Swiss star, [[Hugo Koblet]]. Anquetil was not amused. When he beat Koblet, he sent his winner's bouquet to P\u00e9lissier's wife \"in deepest sympathy\".<ref name=anquetil />\n\nAnquetil rode the Grand Prix des Nations nine times without being beaten.\n\n== Hour record ==\n[[File:Anquetil memorial at Quincampoix 03.jpg|thumb|200px|Anquetil memorial at [[Quincampoix]]]]\nOn 22 September 1954, Anquetil started two years' compulsory service in the army, joining the Richepanse de Rouen barracks as a gunner of the 406th artillery regiment. The army accorded him few great favours but there was an exception:\n\n{{cquote|In June 1956, my chiefs finally gave me an order more to my liking, the strangest, the most unusual that a gunner has ever been asked to carry out; it was nothing less than to beat the world [[hour record]]. I knew what that meant: to storm a veritable fortress. For 14 years, since 7 November 1942, the date on which Fausto Coppi planted the Italian flag on it, it had discouraged all assailants. One figure sums up the difficulty of the enterprise: 45.848&nbsp;km.<ref name=anquetil />}}\n\nShould he break the record, he and the army agreed, he would give half the rewards to the army and the rest to the mother of a soldier, Andr\u00e9 Dufour, who had been killed while fighting at Palestro, in [[Algeria]].<ref name=Chany>Chany, Pierre (1988), ''La Fabuleuse Histoire de Cyclisme'', Nathan, France. {{ISBN|2092864319}}</ref> The chances of breaking it were far from guaranteed, not only because Coppi's record had already defied [[Gerrit Schulte]] and [[Louison Bobet]] but also Anquetil himself, on 23 November 1955, when he had started too fast, faded and finished 696&nbsp;m short of Coppi. His second attempt also flopped. He again started too fast. After 54:36 his helpers called him to a stop after 41.326&nbsp;km. His legs failed him when he got off his bike and he had to be carried to a chair in a corner of the [[Velodromo Vigorelli]], the [[velodrome]] in [[Milan]], Italy. The Italian crowd chanted: \"Coppi! Coppi! Coppi!\"<ref name=anquetil /><ref name=anquetil /><ref name=\"Chany\" />\n\n{{cquote|I was like a child's lead soldier that has lost its horse.\"<ref name=anquetil />}}\n\nNext day he received a telegram: \"Congratulations on a good performance. Sure of your success. Take your time. Captain Gueguen will arrive tomorrow with instructions. Signed: Commander Dieudonn\u00e9\".<ref name=\"Chany\" />\n\nAt 7:30pm on 29 June 1956, riding a lighter bike made in three days to the same design as Coppi's, and using a 7m40 gear (52x15), Anquetil tried again and finally broke his hero's record, riding 46.159&nbsp;km. Coppi was the first professional to give Anquetil his autograph.<ref>Interview, Magazine 24, ORTF (television), France, 20 November 1963</ref> When the two next met, Anquetil was also a professional. He went to Italy to meet Coppi and, for reasons never explained, dressed as a simple country boy rather than in the smart clothes that he normally wore.\n\n{{cquote|The grandstands fell quiet. They were preparing to take Coppi to the cemetery. I liked that silence. On the 84th lap, Boucher gave me my release. \"''Allez, m\u00f4me, tout''!\" [\"Go, kid, give it everything!\"] Until then I had been well within myself [''J'ai fum\u00e9 ma pipe'']... On a big school blackboard, Captain Gueguen wrote 46.159km. I could lift my arms, sit up and breathe a bit of fresh air. Ah, the public! Those who were whistling me four laps earlier kissed my bike, my jersey, reaching out to touch me in the way they do during processions of holy relics.<ref name=anquetil />}}\n\nIn 1967, 11 years later, Anquetil again broke the hour record, with 47.493&nbsp;km, but the record was disallowed because he refused to take the newly introduced post-race doping test.<ref name=Cycling /> He objected to what he saw as the indignity of having to urinate in a tent in a crowded velodrome and said he would take the test at his hotel. The international judge ruled against the idea and a scuffle ensued that involved Anquetil's manager, [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]]. ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' reported:<ref name=\"Cycling 7 Oct 1967\" />\n\n<blockquote>Wonderful Jacques Anquetil has broken the world hour record as he said he would... and then ran into official trouble when he refused to take a trackside dope test demanded by the Italian authorities. An Italian Dr Giuliano Marena asked for the urine sample, but Anquetil refused and asked him to come to his hotel. Dr Marena refused and, after waiting a couple of hours at the track, left town to go home to Florence. Anquetil said at his hotel: 'I didn't and don't intend to escape the test, but it must take place under circumstances far different from those at the velodrome. I'm still here and ready to undergo the test.' While Italian officials talked of taking the matter to the UCI, Dr Tanguy of the FFC [French cycling federation] took a sample from Anquetil on his return to Rouen, pointing out afterwards that it would be valid up to 48 hours after the record attempt. But Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani, his manager, had all but lost his temper with the Italian medical man and had tried to throw him out of the cabin, though Jacques had remonstrated mildly. Later he said that he understood the tests would be valid for up to 48 hours and said he was trying to locate another doctor for the test.<ref name=\"Cycling 7 Oct 1967\">Cycling, 7 October 1967, p. 4</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Tour de France ==\n[[File:Jacques Anquetil 1963.jpg|thumb|Anquetil at the [[1963 Tour de France]]]]\n[[File:Anquetil Poulidor Bahamontes 1964.jpg|thumb|Anquetil (center) at the [[1964 Tour de France]]]]\nIn 1957 Anquetil rode \u2013 and won \u2013 his first [[1957 Tour de France|Tour de France]]. His inclusion in the national team \u2013 the Tour was still ridden by national rather than commercial teams \u2013 was what the French broadcaster Jean-Paul Ollivier called \"a forceps operation\".<ref name=Ollivier>Ollivier, Jean-Paul (1999): ''Maillot Jaune'', Reader's Digest Selection, France</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[[Louison Bobet]] and [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]] wished to rule the Tour de France and had no desire to have Anquetil. But Louison, worn out from his battle of nerves that he suffered in the Tour of Italy, where he used all his energy in defending the ''maglia rosa'' [leader's jersey] against Italian hatred [''d\u00e9ferlante''], declared, on the banks of the Adriatic; \"I am not prepared, mentally, to take part in the Tour de France. I am 32 in a world of youth.\"<ref name=Ollivier /></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil recognised the allusion and accepted the invitation to ride. He finished nearly 15 minutes ahead of the rest, winning four stages and the team stage.\n\nIn 1959, Anquetil was whistled as he finished the Tour on the [[Parc des Princes]] because spectators calculated that he and others had contrived to let [[Federico Bahamontes]] win rather than the Frenchman [[Henry Anglade]]. The French team was unbalanced by internal rivalries. Anglade, whose bossy nature earned him the nickname [[Napoleon]], was unusual in that he was represented by the agent Roger Piel while the others had Daniel Dousset. The two men controlled French racing.<ref>''Dousset-Piel, l'Age de Bronze'', V\u00e9lo, France November 2005</ref> Dousset worked out that his riders had to beat Bahamontes or make sure that Anglade didn't win. Since they couldn't beat Anglade, they let Bahamontes win because Bahamontes, a poor rider on the flat and on small circuits, would be no threat to the post-Tour criterium fees that made up the bulk of riders' \u2014 and agents' \u2014 earnings.\n\nAnquetil was jeered and showed his coldness to public reaction by buying a boat that he named \"The Whistles of 59\" and by pointing out that he was a professional and that his first interest was money. It was an attitude that other riders understood but made him hard for fans to love .\n\nIn 1960 Anquetil stayed away from the Tour, returning in [[1961 Tour de France|1961]] and winning it thereafter until [[1964 Tour de France|1964]]. He won in [[1962 Tour de France|1962]] at a speed not bettered until [[1981 Tour de France|1981]]. He was the first to win four successive times, breaking the record of three set by [[Philippe Thys]] and [[Louison Bobet]]. He was first to win five times in total, since emulated by [[Eddy Merckx]], [[Bernard Hinault]] and [[Miguel Indurain]].\n\nIn 1963 Tour, at the top of a mountain, Anquetil faked a mechanical problem so that his team director could give him a bicycle more suitable for the descent. The plan worked and Anquetil overtook Bahamontes and won the stage, taking the lead.\n\nHis last Tour victory (in 1964) was his most famous, featuring an elbow-to-elbow duel with public favourite [[Raymond Poulidor]] on the road up the [[Puy-de-D\u00f4me (mountain)|Puy de D\u00f4me mountain]] on 12 July. Suffering indigestion after excesses on a rest day, Anquetil was said to have received a swallow of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] from his team manager \u2014 a story Anquetil's wife says is untrue.\n\nThe Tour organiser, [[Jacques Goddet]], was behind the pair as they turned off the main road and climbed through what the police estimated as half a million spectators. He recalled:\n\n<blockquote>The two, at the extreme of their rivalry, climbing the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman [Anquetil], used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to me, it was clear that Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly then he would have cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still think that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.<ref>Goddet, Jacques (1991): ''L'\u00c9quip\u00e9e Belle'', Robert Laffont, France</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil rode on the inside by the mountain wall while Poulidor took the outer edge by the precipice. They could sometimes feel the other's gasps on their bare arms. At the end, Anquetil cracked, after a battle of wills and legs so intense that at times they banged elbows. Of Anquetil, [[Pierre Chany]] wrote: <blockquote>\"His face, until then purple, lost all its colour; the sweat ran down in drops through the creases of his cheeks.\"<ref name=Chany /></blockquote> Anquetil was only semi-conscious, he said.<ref name=Chany /> Anquetil's manager, Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani, said:\n\n<blockquote>Anquetil's head was a computer. It started working: in 500 metres, Poulidor wouldn't get his 56 seconds. I'll never forget what happened when Jacques crossed the line. Close to fainting, he collapsed on the front of my car. With barely any breath left, exhausted, but 200 per cent lucid, he asked me: 'How much?' I told him 14 seconds. 'That's one more than I need. I've got 13 in hand'.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>In my opinion Poulidor was demoralised by Anquetil's resistance, his mental strength. There were three times when he could have dropped Anquetil. First, at the bottom of the climb. Then when Julio Jimenez attacked [and left the two Frenchmen, accompanied by the rival climber Federico Bahamontes]. Finally in the last kilometre. The nearer the summit came, the more Jacques was suffering. In the last few hundred metres, he was losing time. At the top of the Puy it's 13 per cent. Poulidor should have attacked: he didn't. Poulidor didn't attack in the last 500 metres \u2013 it was Jacques who got dropped, and that's not the same thing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}</blockquote>\n\nPoulidor gained time but Anquetil still had a 55-second lead in Paris and won his last Tour. The writer [[Chris Sidwells]] said:\n\n<blockquote>The race also ended the Anquetil era in Tour history. He could not face riding it the following year, and in 1966 he retired from the Tour with bad health \u2013 once he'd made sure that Poulidor could not win either.<ref group=\"n\">In 1966 Anquetil prevented Poulidor from winning the Tour by putting his team-mate Lucien Aimar in a position to win.</ref> Poulidor may not have managed to slay his dragon, in fact so bloodied was he by his battle that he never did win the Tour, but he did manage to wound his rival, and in so doing brought down the curtain on the rule of the first five-times winner \u2013 the first great super-champion of the Tour de France.<ref>[[Chris Sidwells|Sidwells, Chris]] (2003) ''Golden Stages of the Tour de France'', comp: Allchin, Richard and Bell, Adrian, Mousehold Press, UK</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil was first to win all three [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]]. He twice won the [[Giro d'Italia]] ([[1960 Giro d'Italia|1960]], [[1964 Giro d'Italia|1964]]) and won the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] once ([[1963 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1963]]). He also won the season-long ''[[Super Prestige Pernod International]]'' four times, in 1961, 1963, 1965 and 1966 \u2014 a record surpassed only by [[Eddy Merckx]].\n\n== Anquetil\u2013Poulidor: the social significance ==\n[[File:Poulidor.jpg|right|thumb|[[Raymond Poulidor]]]]\n\nAnquetil unfailingly beat [[Raymond Poulidor]] in the Tour and yet Poulidor remained more popular. Divisions between their fans became marked, which two sociologists studying the impact of the Tour on French society say became emblematic of France old and new. The extent of those divisions is shown in a story, perhaps apocryphal, told by [[Pierre Chany]], who was close to Anquetil:\n\n<blockquote>The Tour de France has the major fault of dividing the country, right down to the smallest hamlet, even families, into two rival camps. I know a man who grabbed his wife and held her on the grill of a heated stove, seated and with her skirts held up, for favouring Jacques Anquetil when he preferred Raymond Poulidor. The following year, the woman became a Poulidor-iste. But it was too late. The husband had switched his allegiance to Gimondi. The last I heard they were digging in their heels and the neighbours were complaining.<ref name=wood /></blockquote>\n\nJean-Luc Boeuf and Yves L\u00e9onard, in their study, wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Those who recognised themselves in Jacques Anquetil liked his priority of style and elegance in the way he rode. Behind this fluidity and the appearance of ease was the image of France winning and those who took risks identified with him. Humble people saw themselves in Raymond Poulidor, whose face \u2013 lined with effort \u2013 represented the life they led on land they worked without rest or respite. His declarations, full of good sense, delighted the crowds: a race, even a difficult one, lasts less time than a day bringing in the harvest. A big part of the public therefore finished by identifying with the one who symbolised bad luck and the eternal position of runner-up, an image that was far from true for Poulidor, whose record was particularly rich.<ref>The authors quote [[Milan\u2013San Remo]], the [[La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne]], the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] and [[Paris\u2013Nice]].</ref> Even today, the expression of the eternal second and of a Poulidor Complex is associated with a hard life, as an article by Jacques Marseille showed in ''Le Figaro'' when it was headlined \"This country is suffering from a Poulidor Complex\".<ref>''Le Monde'', 16 April 2002, supplement page 3</ref><ref>Boeuf, Jean Luc and L\u00e9onard Yves (2003), ''La R\u00e9publique du Tour de France'', Seuil, France. {{ISBN|202058073X}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Dauphin\u00e9 and Bordeaux\u2013Paris double ==\nIn 1965, Anquetil won the eight-day Alpine [[Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9]] Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 stage race at 3pm, sat through two hours of interviews and receptions, took a chartered flight in a French Mirage fighter plane (allegedly organised by President Charles de Gaulle, a big admirer of his) to [[Bordeaux]] at 6.30pm and won the world's longest single-day classic, [[Bordeaux\u2013Paris]], the following day. The race started at night and continued from after dawn behind [[derny]] motorcycle pacers.\n\nAnquetil was upset, said G\u00e9miniani, that Poulidor was always more warmly regarded even though he had never won the Tour. In 1965, when Poulidor was perceived to have received more credit for dropping Anquetil the previous year on the Puy-de-D\u00f4me than Anquetil had for winning the whole Tour, G\u00e9miniani persuaded him to ride the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 and, next day, Bordeaux\u2013Paris. That, he said, would end any argument over who was the greater.\n\nAnquetil won the Dauphin\u00e9, despite bad weather which he disliked, at 3pm. After two hours of interviews and receptions he flew from N\u00eemes to Bordeaux. At midnight, he ate his pre-race meal and went to the start in the city's northern suburbs.\n\nHe could eat little during the night because of stomach cramp and was on the verge of retiring. G\u00e9miniani swore and called him \"a great poof\" to offend his pride and keep him riding.<ref>{{YouTube|Oz7kIltIpsY}}</ref> Anquetil felt better as morning came and the riders dropped in behind the [[derny]] pacing motorcycles that were a feature of the race. He responded to an attack by [[Tom Simpson]], followed by his own team-mate [[Jean Stablinski]]. Anquetil and Stablinski attacked Simpson alternately, forcing Simpson to exhaust himself, and Anquetil won at the [[Parc des Princes]]. Stablinski finished 57 seconds later just ahead of Simpson.<ref>[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/veloarchive/exploits/65double.htm Anquetil's impossible double] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002194650/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/veloarchive/exploits/65double.htm |date=2 October 2007 }}. ntlworld.com</ref>\n\nThe historian Dick Yates said:\n<blockquote>It had been one of the hardest and closest [[derny]]-paced races in history but much more than that this double of Anquetil was one of the greatest exploits ever seen in cycling. At the [[Parc des Princes]], Anquetil received the biggest ovation of his career, certainly much bigger than after any of his wins in the Tour. The race record was broken, Jacques was mobbed by reporters and photographers but he was tired and really had to get some rest. Few people realised it at the time but he had to make the long journey to [[Maubeuge]] in north-eastern France where the following day he was riding a [[criterium]]!<ref name=\"CycNews'97 p19\">Cycling News, UK, December 1997, p. 19</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere are undenied rumours that the jet laid on to get Anquetil to Bordeaux was provided through state funds on the orders of [[President (government title)|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]]. G\u00e9miniani mentions the belief in his biography, without denying it, saying the truth will come out when state records are opened.\n\n== Trofeo Baracchi ==\nAnquetil's most humiliating race was the [[Trofeo Baracchi]] in Italy in 1962, when he had to be pushed by his partner, [[Rudi Altig]], and was so exhausted that he hit a pillar before reaching the track on which the race finished.\n\nThe Trofeo Baracchi was a 111&nbsp;km race for two-man teams. Anquetil, the world's best time-triallist, and Altig, a powerful rider with a strong sprint, were favourites. But things soon went wrong. The writer [[Ren\u00e9 de Latour]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I got my stopwatch going again to check the length of each man's turn at the front. Generally in a race of the Baracchi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints of no more than 300 yards. Altig was at the front when I started the check \u2014 and he was still there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn't even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through... Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things I have ever seen in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years' association with the sport \u2014 something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front \u2014 and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did this not just once but dozens of times.<ref>Sporting Cyclist, UK, undated cutting</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe pair reached the track on which the race finished. The timekeeper was at the entrance to the stadium, so Anquetil finished. But instead of turning on to the [[velodrome]], he rode straight on and hit a pole. He was helped away with staring eyes and with blood streaming from a cut to his head. The pairing nevertheless won by nine seconds.\n\n== Other races ==\nAnquetil was not as successful in the classic single-day races but towards the end of his career he won:\n* [[Gent\u2013Wevelgem]] (1964)\n* [[Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]] (1966)\n\nAnquetil finished in the top 10 in the [[world cycling championship|world championship]] on six occasions, but second place in 1966 was the nearest he came to the rainbow jersey.<ref name=\"sports-reference\" />\n\n== Riding style ==\nAnquetil was a smooth rider, a beautiful pedalling machine according to the American journalist Owen Mulholland:\n\n<blockquote>The sight of Jacques Anquetil on a bicycle gives credence to an idea we Americans find unpalatable, that of a natural aristocracy. From the first day he seriously straddled a top tube, \"Anq\" had a sense or perfection most riders spend a lifetime searching for. Between 1950, when he rode his first race, and nineteen years later, when he retired, Anquetil had countless frames underneath him, yet that indefinable poise was always there.<ref name=\"BikeRaceInfo\" /></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The look was that of a greyhound. His arms and legs were extended more than was customary in his era of pounded post World War II roads. And the toes pointed down. Just a few years before, riders had prided their ankling motion, but Jacques was the first of the big gear school. His smooth power dictated his entire approach to the sport. Hands resting serenely on his thin [[Mafac]] brake levers, the sensation from Quincampoix, Normandy, appeared to cruise while others wriggled in desperate attempts to keep up.<ref name=\"BikeRaceInfo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/riderhistories/Anquetil%20part%202.html|title=Bikerace Info, Rider database, Jacques Anquetil|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821072612/http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/riderhistories/Anquetil%20part%202.html|archivedate=21 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Physical attributes ==\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Height:\n| 1.76 m\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Weight:\n| {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}}<ref>These and other details published 1966 in ''En Br\u00fblant les \u00c9tapes'', Jacques Anquetil, published Calmann-Levy, France</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Chest:\n| 95&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Arm circumference:\n| 27&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Calf circumference:\n| 32&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Thigh circumference:\n| 47&nbsp;cm\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Foot size:\n| 41\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Lung capacity:\n| 6 litres\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Normal heart rate:\n| 48\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Heart rate after exercise:\n| 90\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Training:\n| 100\u2013120&nbsp;km, three times a week\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right\"|Gym training:\n| 20 minutes, twice a week\n|-\n!! style=\"text-align:right\"|Diet:\n| No restrictions other than sauces.

Dick Yates wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Rapha\u00ebl embarked on a policy of trying to convince Jacques of the need to win more races as he certainly had the ability to do so... Anquetil had a very strong personality so he was not easily dominated but G\u00e9miniani had an even stronger one. He never gave up the task of trying to convince Jacques of the need for more panache, how a man of his talent should have an even bigger list of important wins.<ref name=\"CycNews'97 p19\" /></blockquote>\n\nAs a partnership they won four Tours de France, two Giro d'Italia, the [[Dauphin\u00e9-Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]] and then next day, [[Bordeaux\u2013Paris]]. G\u00e9miniani said of him:\n<blockquote>Today, everybody pays him homage. I nearly blow my top. I can still hear the way he was whistled when he rode. I think of the organisers of the Tour, who shortened the time trial<ref group=\"n\">Anquetil was the dominant time-triallist of his period</ref> to make him lose. His home town of [[Rouen]] organises commemorations but, me, I haven't forgotten that it was in [[Antwerp]] that he made his farewell appearance. More than once, I saw him crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a [[Amateur|dilettante]]. The truth is that Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered as though he was damned. He wasn't a climber. But with bluffing, with guts, he tore them to shreds (''il les a tous couillonn\u00e9s'').<ref>L'Express 19 June 2003</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Honours ==\nAnquetil was named France's champion of champions by [[L'\u00c9quipe]] in 1963. He was appointed Chevalier de l'[[Ordre national du M\u00e9rite]] in 1965 (cross of merit) and Chevalier de la [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] on 5 October 1966.\n\n== Personal life ==\nAnquetil was fascinated by astronomy and was delighted to meet [[Yuri Gagarin]]. The rational side of his character contrasted with his superstition. In the [[1964 Tour de France]], a fortune-teller called Belline predicted in [[France-Soir]] that Anquetil would die on or around the 13th day of the race. His wife Janine, knowing Anquetil's superstition, hid the paper but Anquetil found out, not least because he was sent cuttings with unsigned letters.<ref name=letour>Le Tour de France, Jean-Paul Brouchon, Balland-Jacob-Duvernet, 2000</ref>\n\nJean-Paul Brouchon, leading cycling commentator at the news radio station France-Info, said of the day the forecast was supposed to come true:\n\n<blockquote>During those dark hours, Anquetil refused to leave his room [the race was having a rest day]. Finally he agreed to go for a short car ride with [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]] [his team manager] and Janine, to join a party organised by Radio Andorra.<ref name=letour /></blockquote>\n\nA mixture of Anquetil's fear for the future and his enjoyment of living in the present led to newspaper pictures of the large meal and the wine that he drank that day. Next morning, still worried about the prediction and laden down by partying, he was dropped on the first hairpins of the [[Port d'Envalira]].\n\nHe was famous for preparing for races by staying up all night drinking and playing cards, although the story seems to have increased with the telling. Nevertheless, his teammate, the British rider [[Vin Denson]], has written in ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' of exuberant parties during races. Denson has written, too, of Anquetil's scrupulous business arrangements with riders and others:\n\n<blockquote>I always considered Jacques to be the very best professional\", he said. \"I admired him for the gentlemanly manner and charm with riders, the public and media. A more honest and sincere businessman and friend you would not find in any walk of life. His word was his all and was of great importance to him. He was a truly great man and champion who will be greatly missed and impossible to replace.<ref name=Cycling>''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' 26 November 1987</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe British journalist Alan Gayfer, former editor of [[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]] said:\n\n<blockquote>Jacques was a real Norman with the nuances of speech that make the Normans famous, they almost say Yes to mean No, and vice versa. I asked him when he was in London if Poulidor, who was often second to Jacques, could ever win the Tour de France: \"Yes\", he said, \"but only if I am riding, and I would always finish ahead of him.<ref name=Cycling /></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>But perhaps my finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]], where a German official had been particularly rude to myself and other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike from the back of the car. Yes, he did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, walked over to the riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall ever see, and for that I shall remember Jacques for a long time.<ref name=Cycling /></blockquote>\n\nDick Yates said:\n<blockquote>\"He had a deep love of the land and was at his happiest when driving a tractor. They [his wife and he] both acquired a taste for bridge parties which often continued late into the night. That Anquetil was a highly intelligent man there can be no doubt and he was the nearest thing to a true intellectual that cycling has ever produced.\"<ref>Cycling News, UK, December 1999, p20</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnquetil married Janine Boeda on 22 December 1958. She had been married to Anquetil's doctor. The doctor, seeing a rival, sent his wife to live with friends.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\">Anquetil le Sultan, Nouvel Observateur, France, 29 April 2004</ref> Anquetil went to see her, disguised as a plumber,<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> and took her to Paris to buy clothes in the [[Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9]].<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />\n\nTheir marriage produced no children. Janine had two children, Alain and Annie, from her previous marriage. Janine had two failed pregnancies and Anquetil grew upset in 1970 that he was not a father.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> The couple considered a surrogate mother before Janine thought of her daughter, Annie. Janine said: \"We didn't use the parental authority that we could have had over her. It was a request that I addressed to her. Gently.

Instead, she grew jealous of her own mother and demanded she leave instead.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> When Janine refused, Annie left. To fill the gap, Janine invited her son, Alain, and his wife, Dominique, to return to live there. Anquetil began an affair with Dominique, to make Annie jealous.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> Dominique had Anquetil's child but Annie still refused to return. Dominique still lives in the house, ''Les Elfes'', where she organises conferences.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> Janine and Anquetil divorced. Sophie moved in with Janine, although she lives now in [[Calenzana]], near [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]].<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" /> Both Janine and Dominique wrote their life story: neither mentioned the link between Sophie and Anquetil.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />\n\n== Doping ==\nAnquetil never hid that he took drugs and in a debate with a government minister on French television said only a fool would imagine it was possible to ride Bordeaux\u2013Paris on just water. He and other cyclists had to ride through \"the cold, through heatwaves, in the rain and in the mountains\", and they had the right to treat themselves as they wished, he said, before adding: \"Leave me in peace; everybody takes dope.\"<ref>Cited in ''Les Miroirs du Tour'', French television, 2003</ref> There was implied acceptance of doping right to the top of the state: [[Charles de Gaulle]] said: \"Doping? What doping? Did he or did he not make them play the [[Marseillaise]] [the national anthem] abroad?\"<ref>Cited ''L'\u00c9quipe Magazine'' 23 July 1994</ref>\n\nAnquetil won [[Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]] in 1966.  An official named Collard told him there would be a drugs test once he had got changed. \"Too late\", Anquetil said. \"If you can collect it from the soapy water there, go ahead. I'm a human being, not a fountain.\" Collard said he would return half an hour later; Anquetil said he would have left for a dinner appointment 140&nbsp;km away. Two days later the Belgian cycling federation disqualified Anquetil and fined him. Anquetil responded by calling urine tests \"a threat to individual liberty\" and engaged a lawyer. The case was never heard, the Belgians backed down and Anquetil became the winner.\n\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=25%|quote=Jacques had the strength \u2013 for which he was always criticised \u2013 to say out loud what others would only whisper.

But the argument found less support as more riders were reported to have died or suffered health problems through drug-related incidents, including the [[death of Tom Simpson]], in the 1967 Tour de France.<ref name=Cycling />\n\nHowever, there was great support in the cyclist community for Anquetil's argument that, if there were to be rules and tests, the tests should be carried out consistently and with dignity. He said it was professional dignity, the right of a champion not to be ridiculed in front of his public, that led to his refusal to take a test in the centre of the Vigorelli track after breaking the world hour record.\n\nThe unrecognised time that Anquetil set that day was nevertheless broken by the Belgian rider [[Ferdinand Bracke]]. Anquetil was hurt that the French government had never sent him a telegram of congratulations but sent one to Bracke, who was not French. It was a measure of the unacceptability of Anquetil's arguments, as was the way he was quietly dropped from future French teams.\n\n== Anquetil and Britain ==\nBritish fans voted Anquetil the [[BBC]]'s international personality of 1964. He appeared with [[Tom Simpson]] from a studio in Paris. The Franco-American journalist [[Ren\u00e9 de Latour]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>In the studio we watched the proceedings in London, and while I cannot say Anquetil was keenly interested in the cricketing part, he was impressed with the general presentation which, however (like the stages of the 1964 Tour) he found a bit long. He was interested, though, to see [[Beryl Burton]], and his old acquaintance [[Reg Harris]] pulling at his pipe in the invited audience.<ref>''Sporting Cyclist'', UK, 1965</ref></blockquote>\n\nA few days later, Anquetil was named French sportsman of the year.\n\nAnquetil was fascinated by British enthusiasm for time-trialling and in 1961 presented prizes at the [[Road Time Trials Council]] evening at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] to honour [[Beryl Burton]] and Brian Kirby.<ref name=Cycling /> The pair had won the women's and men's [[British Best All-Rounder]] competitions (BBAR) for, respectively, the highest average speed in a season over 25, 50 and 100 miles (women) and 50 and {{convert|100|mi|km}} and 12 hours (men).\n\nAlan Gayfer, the editor of ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' at the time of Anquetil's death, wrote in appreciation:\n<blockquote>It is strange to look back and see how this frail-looking young man burst on the scene in 1953. We had sent Ken Joy, the former BBAR, to challenge for the Grand Prix des Nations, then 140 kilometres long, and dragging through the hills of the Chevreuse valley. All over Paris they talked about this burly Englishman who had ridden 160&nbsp;km in 4 hours and 6 minutes: and when it came to it, he was hammered by a 19-year-old, but a teenager with a will of iron that was to prove inflexible for the next 19 years.<ref name=Cycling /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1964 Anquetil discussed riding a British 25&nbsp;mile (40&nbsp;km) race. Gayfer and Tom Simpson explained that the course would be flat and asked Anquetil how long the distance would take him. Anquetil, who could predict his time-trial times accurately, said 46 minutes. That was eight minutes faster than the British record standing to Bas Breedon at 54:23. It took until 1993 for the record to fall below Anquetil's estimation.\n\nAnquetil asked \u00a31,000 to compete and a London timber merchant called Vic Jenner said he would put up the money. Jenner had often put money into the sport. He died shortly afterwards, however, and the ride never happened.<ref>Cited \"Cycling: the golden years\", Springfield Press, UK</ref>\n\nAnquetil took part, with Simpson, in an afternoon of exhibition racing at the Herne Hill track in South London, on 13 June 1964 \u2013 three weeks before starting in the 1964 Tour de France.\n\nAnquetil rode on the [[Isle of Man]] in 1959, 1962 and in 1965, when he won the [[Manx Trophy|Manx Premier]] by beating [[Eddy Merckx]] into second place.<ref name=Cycling />\n\n== Retirement and death ==\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teaufort 78 Anquetil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A memorial plaque to Anquetil in [[Ch\u00e2teaufort, Yvelines|Ch\u00e2teaufort]], France]]\n[[File:Anquetil's memorial at Quincampoix.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A memorial to Anquetil in [[Quincampoix]], France]]\nAnquetil rode his last race not in France, of which he still despaired for its preferring Poulidor, but on 27 December 1969 on the track at [[Antwerp]]. It happened, wrote ''L'\u00c9quipe'' \"to the great indifference of the media.\"<ref group=\"n\">L'\u00c9quipe said Anquetil's  farewell race was in Charleroi. Other reports agree that it was Antwerp.</ref> He retired to a farm at Le Domaine des Elfes, [[La Neuville-Chant-d'Oisel]], 17&nbsp;km from Rouen. The ch\u00e2teau, formerly owned by [[Guy de Maupassant]], was surrounded by 170 hectares.<ref name=\"AnqetiLeSultan\" />\n\nAnquetil was a correspondent for L'\u00c9quipe, consultant for [[Europe 1]] and then on Antenne 2, a race director for [[Paris\u2013Nice]] and the [[Tour M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en]] and in Canada, [[directeur sportif]] of French teams at world championships,<ref name=Cycling /> and a member of the managing committee of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Cyclisme]]. His radio analyses were sharp and he gained notoriety in Belgium for telling [[Luis Oca\u00f1a]], the Spanish rider living in France, how to beat Eddy Merckx.\n\nHe rode his bike only three times in retirement, saying he had already ridden enough. He rode the Grand Prix des Gentlemen in [[Nice]], a race in which old riders were paired with current competitors; he went out for an afternoon with friends in Normandy; and he joined his daughter for a bike ride on her birthday. Other than that, he did not ride his bike after 1969.\n\nOn 18 November 1987, Jacques Anquetil died of [[stomach cancer]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclinghalloffame.com/riders/rider_bio.asp?rider_id=25|title=Cycling Hall of Fame.com|website=www.cyclinghalloffame.com}}</ref> in his sleep at 6{{nbsp}}am at the St-Hilaire Clinic in [[Rouen]]. He had been there since 10 October. The clinic said: \"His state of health had visibly deteriorated over the last hours and he died in his sleep after showing great courage throughout his illness.\"<ref name=Cycling /> Anquetil is buried beside the church in Quincampoix, north of Rouen, where a large black monument by the traffic lights lists his achievements. There is a further monument at the Piste Municipale in Paris, where the centre is named after him.\n\nThe Jacques Anquetil sports stadium at Quincampoix was dedicated in 1983. There are moves to open a museum in his memory.\n\nThe historian Richard Yates wrote:\n[[File:Anquetil's grave at Quincampoix.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Anquetil's grave at Quincampoix, France]]\n<blockquote>He finally came to be respected as one of the most intelligent cyclists ever, but when he died in 1987 he was still to a large extent one of cycling's greatest enigmas. Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani knew him better than anyone and he was such a perceptive man that his comments are particularly interesting. He said that Jacques was one of the most gifted riders of all time but this was hardly reflected by his record. He had won eight major Tours without once crossing the top of a mountain in the lead. His lack of offensive spirit made G\u00e9miniani mad with rage on countless occasions but he was always so incredibly stylish, absolute perfection.<ref name=\"yates\" /></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>His inherent shyness can never fully explain his apparent cold indifference. His roots in the Normandy countryside may explain his love of the land but could not excuse his inability to even make a generous gesture. The hard life that his father had experienced could never pardon the economy of effort with which Jacques was obsessed. In the second half of his career he never made an effort which did not pay off 100 per cent. He reduced a race to a few simple calculations, a few danger men and a few places where it was necessary to make an effort. He spent most of the time at the back of the bunch and did not even know the name of most of the riders.<ref name=\"yates\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe Tour visited Rouen on the 10th anniversary of Anquetil's death. There to remember his first victory in the race were his team-mates, Gilbert Bauvin, Louis Bergard, [[Albert Bouvet]], [[Andr\u00e9 Darrigade]], Jean Forestier, [[Andr\u00e9 Mah\u00e9]], Ren\u00e9 Privat and [[Jean Stablinski]]. There, too, was the team car from Anquetil's first Tour, driven by the man behind the wheel that year, William Odin.<ref>Cycling, \"Anquetil anniversary celebrations\", 5 July 1997</ref>\n\n== Popular culture ==\nAnquetil made an appearance in cartoon form in the animated movie ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]] (Les Triplettes de Belleville)'' (''Belleville Rendez-vous'' in the British release).\n\nThe French film ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' may contain an indirect reference to Anquetil.  A long-lost box of souvenirs found by Am\u00e9lie reminds an ageing estranged father of the time he cheered [[Federico Bahamontes]]' win of the 1959 Tour (Anquetil, a long-time rival of Bahamontes, came third). Am\u00e9lie is later romantically pursued by Nino Quincampoix, who shares a rare surname with the village where Anquetil is buried.\n\n==Career achievements==\n===Major results===\n\nSource:<ref

Local deposits of metal-bearing ores were difficult to process because they were low grade. The nation's large and varied forest resources, which covered 70 percent of the country in the late 1980s, were not utilized extensively. Because of political decisions on local, prefectural, and national levels, Japan decided not to exploit its forest resources for economic gain. Domestic sources only supplied between 25 and 30 percent of the nation's timber needs. Agriculture and fishing were the best developed resources, but only through years of painstaking investment and toil. The nation, therefore, built up the manufacturing and processing industries to convert raw materials imported from abroad. This strategy of economic development necessitated the establishment of a strong economic infrastructure to provide the needed energy, transportation, communications, and technological know-how.\n\nDeposits of [[gold]], [[magnesium]], and [[silver]] meet current industrial demands, but Japan is dependent on foreign sources for many of the minerals essential to modern industry.

It was densely populated and urbanized. Prominent European observers of the time seemed to agree that the Japanese ''\"excel not only all the other Oriental peoples, they surpass the Europeans as well\"'' ([[Alessandro Valignano]], 1584, \"Historia del Principo y Progresso de la Compania de Jesus en las Indias Orientales).\n\nEarly European visitors were amazed by the quality of Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing. This stems from the fact that Japan itself is rather rich in natural resources found commonly in Europe, especially iron.\n\nThe cargo of the first Portuguese ships (usually about 4 smaller-sized ships every year) arriving in Japan almost entirely consisted of Chinese goods (silk, porcelain). The Japanese were very much looking forward to acquiring such goods, but had been prohibited from any contacts with the [[Emperor of China]], as a punishment for [[Wokou|Wak\u014d]] pirate raids. The Portuguese (who were called ''Nanban'', lit. Southern Barbarians) therefore found the opportunity to act as intermediaries in Asian trade.\n\n===Edo period (1603\u20131868)===\n<!-- PLEASE MAKE CHANGES TO THE MAIN ARTICLES AND THEN UPDATE HERE-->\n[[File:\u9d8f\u6587\u9aed\u76bf \u80a5\u524d\u713c\u30fb\u53e4\u4f0a\u4e07\u91cc\u69d8\u5f0f-Barber's Bowl with Cockerel MET DP281043 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Japanese export porcelain]] in the European shape of a barber's shaving basin bowl, with copulating cock, around 1700.]]\nThe beginning of the [[Edo period]] coincides with the last decades of the [[Nanban trade period]], during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. It is at the beginning of the Edo period that Japan built her first ocean-going Western-style warships, such as the [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']], a 500-ton [[galleon]]-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] to the Americas, which then continued to Europe. Also during that period, the ''bakufu'' commissioned around 350 [[Red Seal Ships]], three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as [[Yamada Nagamasa]], were active throughout Asia.\n\nIn order to eradicate the influence of [[Christianization]], Japan entered in a period of isolation called [[sakoku]], during which its economy enjoyed stability and mild progress.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan/The-bakuhan-system#ref319463|title=The Bakuhan System|last=|first=|date=15 February 2018|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref>  But not long after, in the 1650s, the production of [[Japanese export porcelain]] increased greatly when civil war put the main Chinese center of porcelain production, [[Jingdezhen porcelain|in Jingdezhen]], out of action for several decades. For the rest of the 17th century, most [[Japanese porcelain]] production was for export, mostly in [[Kyushu]]. The trade dwindled under renewed Chinese competition by the 1740s, before resuming after the opening of Japan in the mid-19th century.<ref>[[David Battie|Battie, David]], ed., ''Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain'', pp. 71-78, 1990, Conran Octopus. {{ISBN|1850292515}}</ref>     \n\nEconomic development during the Edo period included [[urbanization]], increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign [[commerce]], and a diffusion of trade and [[handicraft]] industries. The [[construction]] trades flourished, along with banking facilities and [[merchant]] associations. Increasingly, [[Han (country subdivision)|''han'']] authorities oversaw the rising [[agriculture|agricultural]] production and the spread of rural handicrafts.\n\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, Edo had a population of more than 1 million and [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]] each had more than 400,000 inhabitants. Many other [[castle town]]s grew as well. Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods.\n\nRice was the base of the economy, as the daimy\u014d collected the taxes from the peasants in the form of rice. Taxes were high, about 40% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the ''[[fudasashi]]'' market in [[Edo]]. To raise money, the daimy\u014d used [[forward contract]]s to sell rice that was not even harvested yet. These contracts were similar to modern [[futures trading]].\n\nDuring the period, Japan progressively studied Western sciences and techniques (called ''[[rangaku]]'', literally \"Dutch studies\") through the information and books received through the Dutch traders in [[Dejima]]. The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or [[wadokei]], inspired from Western techniques.\n\n===Pre-war period (1868\u20131945)===\n<!-- PLEASE MAKE CHANGES TO THE MAIN ARTICLES AND THEN UPDATE HERE-->\n\nSince the mid-19th century, after the [[Meiji Restoration]], the country was opened up to Western commerce and influence and Japan has gone through two periods of economic development. The first began in earnest in 1868 and extended through to World War II; the second began in 1945 and continued into the mid-1980s.\n\nEconomic developments of the [[Empire of Japan|prewar period]] began with the \"[[Fukoku ky\u014dhei|Rich State and Strong Army Policy]]\" by the [[Meiji government]]. During the [[Meiji period]] (1868\u20131912), leaders inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan ([[Oyatoi gaikokujin]]). The government also built railroads, improved road, and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development.\n\nTo promote [[industrialization]], the government decided that, while it should help private business to allocate resources and to plan, the public sector was best equipped to stimulate economic growth. The greatest role of government was to help provide good economic conditions for business. In short, government was to be the guide and business the producer. In the early Meiji period, the government built factories and shipyards that were sold to entrepreneurs at a fraction of their value. Many of these businesses grew rapidly into the larger [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Government emerged as chief promoter of [[private enterprise]], enacting a series of pro-business policies.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, the Japanese nominal wage rates were \"10 times less\" than the one of the U.S (based on mid-1930s exchange rates), while the price level is estimated to have been about 44% the one of the U.S.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fukao |first=Kyoji |title=Real GDP in Pre-War East Asia: A 1934\u201336 Benchmark Purchasing Power Parity Comparison with the US |year=2007 |url=http://gpih.ucdavis.edu/files/Fukao_Ma_Yuan.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Postwar period (1945\u2013present)===\n[[File:2005Japanese exports.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Japanese exports in 2005]]\n{{See also|Japanese post-war economic miracle|Economic history of Japan}}\n\nFrom the 1960s to the 1980s, overall real economic growth was extremely large: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and a 4% average in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-7176.html | title = Japan: Patterns of Development | publisher = country-data.com |date=January 1994 | accessdate=28 December 2006}}</ref> By the end of said period, Japan had moved into being a high-wage economy.<ref>Business in context: an introduction to business and its environment by David Needle</ref>\n\nGrowth slowed markedly in the late 1990s also termed [[Lost Decade (Japan)|the Lost Decade]] after the collapse of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]]. As a consequence Japan ran massive budget deficits (added trillions in Yen to Japanese financial system) to finance large [[public works]] programs.\n\nBy 1998, Japan's public works projects still could not stimulate demand enough to end the economy's stagnation. In desperation, the Japanese government undertook \"structural reform\" policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Unfortunately, these policies led Japan into deflation on numerous occasions between 1999 and 2004. The Bank of Japan used [[quantitative easing]] to expand the country's money supply in order to raise expectations of inflation and spur economic growth. Initially, the policy failed to induce any growth, but it eventually began to affect inflationary expectations. By late 2005, the economy finally began what seems to be a sustained recovery. GDP growth for that year was 2.8%, with an annualized fourth quarter expansion of 5.5%, surpassing the growth rates of the US and [[Economy of the European Union|European Union]] during the same period.<ref>Masake, Hisane.

It is considered an important element in any major change, before any formal steps are taken, and successful ''nemawashi'' enables changes to be carried out with the consent of all sides.\n\nJapanese companies are known for management methods such as \"[[The Toyota Way]]\". [[Kaizen]] ([[wikt:\u6539\u5584|\u6539\u5584]], Japanese for \"improvement\") is a Japanese philosophy that focuses on continuous improvement throughout all aspects of life. When applied to the workplace, Kaizen activities continually improve all functions of a business, from manufacturing to management and from the CEO to the assembly line workers.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Imai\n | first = Masaaki\n | title = Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success\n | location = New York, NY\n | publisher = Random House\n | year = 1986\n}}</ref> By improving standardized activities and processes, Kaizen aims to eliminate waste (see [[Lean manufacturing]]). Kaizen was first implemented in several Japanese businesses during the country's recovery after World War II, including Toyota, and has since spread to businesses throughout the world.<ref>Europe Japan Centre, Kaizen Strategies for Improving Team Performance, Ed. Michael Colenso, London: Pearson Education Limited, 2000</ref> Within certain value systems, it is ironic that Japanese workers labor amongst the most hours per day, even though kaizen is supposed to improve all aspects of life. According to the OECD, annual hours worked per employee is below the OECD average and in the middle among G7 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.oecd.org/chart/5Stk|title=Interactive charts by the OECD|website=OECD Data|language=en|accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome companies have powerful enterprise unions and ''[[shunt\u014d]]''.  The [[Nenko System]] or Nenko Joretsu, as it is called in Japan, is the Japanese system of promoting an employee based on his or her proximity to [[retirement]]. The advantage of the system is that it allows older employees to achieve a higher salary level before retirement and it usually brings more experience to the executive ranks. The disadvantage of the system is that it does not allow new talent to be combined with experience and those with specialized skills cannot be promoted to the already crowded executive ranks. It also does not guarantee or even attempt to bring the \"right person for the right job\".\n\nRelationships between government bureaucrats and companies are often close. {{Nihongo|[[Amakudari]]|\u5929\u4e0b\u308a|amakudari|\"descent from heaven\"}} is the institutionalised practice where Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high-profile positions in the private and public sectors. The practice is increasingly viewed as corrupt and a limitation on efforts to reduce ties between the private sector and the state that prevent economic and political reforms.

Its frequent use by Japanese corporations, and its prevalence in Japanese [[manga]] and anime has gradually led to its acceptance in English-speaking countries as a noun for a Japanese [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] businessman. The word can be found in many books and articles pertaining to Japanese culture. Immediately following World War II, becoming a salaryman was viewed as a gateway to a stable, middle-class lifestyle. In modern use, the term carries associations of long working hours, low prestige in the corporate hierarchy, absence of significant sources of income other than salary, [[wage slavery]], and [[kar\u014dshi]]. The term salaryman refers almost exclusively to males.\n\nAn [[office lady]], often abbreviated OL (Japanese: \u30aa\u30fc\u30a8\u30eb ''\u014ceru''), is a female [[office worker]] in Japan who performs generally [[pink collar]] tasks such as serving tea and [[secretary|secretarial]] or [[clerk (position)|clerical]] work. Like many unmarried Japanese, OLs often [[parasite single|live with their parents]] well into [[early adulthood]]. Office ladies are usually [[Full-time job|full-time]] permanent staff, although the jobs they do usually have little opportunity for [[promotion (rank)|promotion]], and there is usually the [[wikt:tacit|tacit]] expectation that they leave their jobs once they get married.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[Freeter]]|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc|fur\u012bt\u0101}} is a Japanese expression for people between the age of 15 and 34 who lack full-time employment or are unemployed, excluding homemakers and students. They may also be described as ''[[underemployment|underemployed]]'' or [[freelance]] workers. These people do not start a [[career]] after [[Secondary education in Japan|high school]] or [[List of universities in Japan|university]] but instead usually live as [[parasite single]]s with their parents and earn some money with low skilled and low paid jobs. The low income makes it difficult for freeters to start a family, and the lack of qualifications makes it difficult to start a career at a later point in life.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[Kar\u014dshi]]|\u904e\u52b4\u6b7b|''kar\u014dshi''}}, which can be translated quite literally from Japanese as \"[[death from overwork]]\", is occupational sudden death. The major medical causes of kar\u014dshi deaths are heart attack and stroke due to stress.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[S\u014dkaiya]]|\u7dcf\u4f1a\u5c4b|s\u014dkaiya}}, (sometimes also translated as ''corporate bouncers'', ''meeting-men'', or ''corporate blackmailers'') are a form of specialized [[racketeer]] unique to Japan, and often associated with the [[yakuza]] that extort money from or blackmail companies by threatening to publicly [[Humiliation|humiliate]] companies and their management, usually in their {{Nihongo|annual meeting|\u7dcf\u4f1a|s\u014dkai}}.  {{Nihongo|[[Sarakin]]|\u30b5\u30e9\u91d1}} is a Japanese term for moneylender, or [[loan shark]]. It is a contraction of the Japanese words for [[salaryman]] and cash. Around 14 million people, or 10% of the Japanese population, have borrowed from a ''sarakin''. In total, there are about 10,000 firms (down from 30,000 a decade ago); however, the top seven firms make up 70% of the market. The value of outstanding loans totals $100 billion. The biggest ''sarakin'' are publicly traded and often allied with [[List of banks in Japan|big banks]].<ref name=\"economist\">[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11413090 Lenders of first resort], ''The Economist'', 22 May 2008</ref>\n\nThe first \"Western-style\" [[department stores in Japan|department store in Japan]] was [[Mitsukoshi]], founded in 1904, which has its root as a [[kimono]] store called Echigoya from 1673. When the roots are considered, however, [[Matsuzakaya]] has an even longer history, dated from 1611. The kimono store changed to a department store in 1910. In 1924, Matsuzakaya store in [[Ginza]] allowed street shoes to be worn indoors, something innovative at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matsuzakaya.co.jp/corporate/history/honshi/index.shtml |title=\u677e\u5742\u5c4b\u300c\u3072\u3068\u30fb\u3053\u3068\u30fb\u3082\u306e\u300d\u8a9e\u308a |publisher=Matsuzakaya.co.jp |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref> These former kimono shop department stores dominated the market in its earlier history. They sold, or rather displayed, luxurious products, which contributed for their sophisticated atmospheres. Another origin of Japanese department store is that from railway company. There have been many [[private railway]] operators in the nation, and from the 1920s, they started to build department stores directly linked to their lines' [[Terminal train station|termini]]. [[Seibu Department Stores|Seibu]] and [[Hankyu Department Stores|Hankyu]] are the typical examples of this type.  From the 1980s onwards, Japanese department stores face fierce competition from supermarkets and convenience stores, gradually losing their presences. Still, ''dep\u0101to'' are bastions of several aspects of cultural conservatism in the country. Gift certificates for prestigious department stores are frequently given as formal presents in Japan. Department stores in Japan generally offer a wide range of services and can include [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], travel reservations, ticket sales for local concerts and other events.\n\n===Keiretsu===\n{{Main|Keiretsu}}\nA {{Nihongo|[[keiretsu]]|\u7cfb\u5217|extra=\"system\" or \"series\"}} is a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. It is a type of [[business group]]. The prototypical ''keiretsu'' appeared in Japan during the \"[[Japanese post-war economic miracle|economic miracle]]\" following World War II. Before Japan's surrender, Japanese industry was controlled by large family-controlled [[vertical monopoly|vertical monopolies]] called ''[[zaibatsu]]''. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] dismantled the ''zaibatsu'' in the late 1940s, but the companies formed from the dismantling of the ''zaibatsu'' were reintegrated.  The dispersed corporations were re-interlinked through share purchases to form horizontally integrated alliances across many industries. Where possible, ''keiretsu'' companies would also supply one another, making the alliances vertically integrated as well.  In this period, official government policy promoted the creation of robust trade corporations that could withstand pressures from intensified world trade competition.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1954/07/17/archives/japan-again-plans-huge-corporations.html?sq=ogasawara&scp=46&st=p  \"Japan Again Plans Huge Corporations,\"] ''New York Times.'' 17 July 1954.</ref>\n\nThe major ''keiretsu'' were each centered on one bank, which lent money to the ''keiretsu's'' member companies and held equity positions in the companies. Each central bank had great control over the companies in the ''keiretsu'' and acted as a monitoring entity and as an emergency bail-out entity. One effect of this structure was to minimize the presence of [[hostile takeover]]s in Japan, because no entities could challenge the power of the banks.\n\nThere are two types of ''keiretsu'': vertical and horizontal. Vertical ''keiretsu'' illustrates the organization and relationships within a company (for example all factors of production of a certain product are connected), while a horizontal ''keiretsu'' shows relationships between entities and industries, normally centered on a bank and trading company. Both are complexly woven together and sustain each other.\n\nThe Japanese recession in the 1990s had profound effects on the keiretsu. Many of the largest banks were hit hard by bad loan portfolios and forced to merge or go out of business. This had the effect of blurring the lines between the keiretsu: [[Sumitomo Bank]] and [[Mitsui]] Bank, for instance, became [[Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation]] in 2001, while [[Sanwa Bank]] (the banker for the Hankyu-Toho Group) became part of [[Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ]]. Additionally, many companies from outside the keiretsu system, such as [[Sony]], began outperforming their counterparts within the system.\n\nGenerally, these causes gave rise to a strong notion in the business community that the old keiretsu system was not an effective business model, and led to an overall loosening of keiretsu alliances. While the keiretsu still exist, they are not as centralized or integrated as they were before the 1990s. This, in turn, has led to a growing [[corporate acquisition]] industry in Japan, as companies are no longer able to be easily \"bailed out\" by their banks, as well as rising [[derivative litigation]] by more independent shareholders.\n\n== Mergers and Acquisitions ==\nJapanese companies have been involved in 50,759 deals between 1985 and 2018. This cumulates to a total value of 2,636 bil. USD which translates to 281,469.9 bil.

Local deposits of metal-bearing ores were difficult to process because they were low grade. The nation's large and varied forest resources, which covered 70 percent of the country in the late 1980s, were not utilized extensively. Because of political decisions on local, prefectural, and national levels, Japan decided not to exploit its forest resources for economic gain. Domestic sources only supplied between 25 and 30 percent of the nation's timber needs. Agriculture and fishing were the best developed resources, but only through years of painstaking investment and toil. The nation, therefore, built up the manufacturing and processing industries to convert raw materials imported from abroad. This strategy of economic development necessitated the establishment of a strong economic infrastructure to provide the needed energy, transportation, communications, and technological know-how.\n\nDeposits of [[gold]], [[magnesium]], and [[silver]] meet current industrial demands, but Japan is dependent on foreign sources for many of the minerals essential to modern industry. [[Iron ore]], [[copper]], [[bauxite]], and [[alumina]] must be imported, as well as many forest products.\n\nCompared to other industrialized economies, Japan is characterized by its low levels of exports relative to the size of its GDP. From the period 1970-2018, Japan was either the least or second least export-dependent economy in the [[Group of Seven|G7]], and one of the least export-dependent economies in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS?locations=US-JP-DE-GB-FR-IT-CA|title=Exports of goods and services (% of GDP) - United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref> It has also been one of the least trade-dependent economies in the 1970-2018 period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS?locations=US-JP-DE-GB-FR-IT-CA|title=Trade (% of GDP) - United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapan receives exceptionally low levels of foreign investment.

It was densely populated and urbanized. Prominent European observers of the time seemed to agree that the Japanese ''\"excel not only all the other Oriental peoples, they surpass the Europeans as well\"'' ([[Alessandro Valignano]], 1584, \"Historia del Principo y Progresso de la Compania de Jesus en las Indias Orientales).\n\nEarly European visitors were amazed by the quality of Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing. This stems from the fact that Japan itself is rather rich in natural resources found commonly in Europe, especially iron.\n\nThe cargo of the first Portuguese ships (usually about 4 smaller-sized ships every year) arriving in Japan almost entirely consisted of Chinese goods (silk, porcelain). The Japanese were very much looking forward to acquiring such goods, but had been prohibited from any contacts with the [[Emperor of China]], as a punishment for [[Wokou|Wak\u014d]] pirate raids. The Portuguese (who were called ''Nanban'', lit. Southern Barbarians) therefore found the opportunity to act as intermediaries in Asian trade.\n\n===Edo period (1603\u20131868)===\n<!-- PLEASE MAKE CHANGES TO THE MAIN ARTICLES AND THEN UPDATE HERE-->\n[[File:\u9d8f\u6587\u9aed\u76bf \u80a5\u524d\u713c\u30fb\u53e4\u4f0a\u4e07\u91cc\u69d8\u5f0f-Barber's Bowl with Cockerel MET DP281043 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Japanese export porcelain]] in the European shape of a barber's shaving basin bowl, with copulating cock, around 1700.]]\nThe beginning of the [[Edo period]] coincides with the last decades of the [[Nanban trade period]], during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. It is at the beginning of the Edo period that Japan built her first ocean-going Western-style warships, such as the [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']], a 500-ton [[galleon]]-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] to the Americas, which then continued to Europe. Also during that period, the ''bakufu'' commissioned around 350 [[Red Seal Ships]], three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as [[Yamada Nagamasa]], were active throughout Asia.\n\nIn order to eradicate the influence of [[Christianization]], Japan entered in a period of isolation called [[sakoku]], during which its economy enjoyed stability and mild progress.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan/The-bakuhan-system#ref319463|title=The Bakuhan System|last=|first=|date=15 February 2018|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref>  But not long after, in the 1650s, the production of [[Japanese export porcelain]] increased greatly when civil war put the main Chinese center of porcelain production, [[Jingdezhen porcelain|in Jingdezhen]], out of action for several decades. For the rest of the 17th century, most [[Japanese porcelain]] production was for export, mostly in [[Kyushu]]. The trade dwindled under renewed Chinese competition by the 1740s, before resuming after the opening of Japan in the mid-19th century.<ref>[[David Battie|Battie, David]], ed., ''Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain'', pp. 71-78, 1990, Conran Octopus. {{ISBN|1850292515}}</ref>     \n\nEconomic development during the Edo period included [[urbanization]], increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign [[commerce]], and a diffusion of trade and [[handicraft]] industries. The [[construction]] trades flourished, along with banking facilities and [[merchant]] associations. Increasingly, [[Han (country subdivision)|''han'']] authorities oversaw the rising [[agriculture|agricultural]] production and the spread of rural handicrafts.\n\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, Edo had a population of more than 1 million and [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]] each had more than 400,000 inhabitants. Many other [[castle town]]s grew as well. Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods.\n\nRice was the base of the economy, as the daimy\u014d collected the taxes from the peasants in the form of rice. Taxes were high, about 40% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the ''[[fudasashi]]'' market in [[Edo]]. To raise money, the daimy\u014d used [[forward contract]]s to sell rice that was not even harvested yet. These contracts were similar to modern [[futures trading]].\n\nDuring the period, Japan progressively studied Western sciences and techniques (called ''[[rangaku]]'', literally \"Dutch studies\") through the information and books received through the Dutch traders in [[Dejima]]. The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or [[wadokei]], inspired from Western techniques.\n\n===Pre-war period (1868\u20131945)===\n<!-- PLEASE MAKE CHANGES TO THE MAIN ARTICLES AND THEN UPDATE HERE-->\n\nSince the mid-19th century, after the [[Meiji Restoration]], the country was opened up to Western commerce and influence and Japan has gone through two periods of economic development. The first began in earnest in 1868 and extended through to World War II; the second began in 1945 and continued into the mid-1980s.\n\nEconomic developments of the [[Empire of Japan|prewar period]] began with the \"[[Fukoku ky\u014dhei|Rich State and Strong Army Policy]]\" by the [[Meiji government]]. During the [[Meiji period]] (1868\u20131912), leaders inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan ([[Oyatoi gaikokujin]]). The government also built railroads, improved road, and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development.\n\nTo promote [[industrialization]], the government decided that, while it should help private business to allocate resources and to plan, the public sector was best equipped to stimulate economic growth. The greatest role of government was to help provide good economic conditions for business. In short, government was to be the guide and business the producer. In the early Meiji period, the government built factories and shipyards that were sold to entrepreneurs at a fraction of their value. Many of these businesses grew rapidly into the larger [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Government emerged as chief promoter of [[private enterprise]], enacting a series of pro-business policies.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, the Japanese nominal wage rates were \"10 times less\" than the one of the U.S (based on mid-1930s exchange rates), while the price level is estimated to have been about 44% the one of the U.S.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fukao |first=Kyoji |title=Real GDP in Pre-War East Asia: A 1934\u201336 Benchmark Purchasing Power Parity Comparison with the US |year=2007 |url=http://gpih.ucdavis.edu/files/Fukao_Ma_Yuan.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Postwar period (1945\u2013present)===\n[[File:2005Japanese exports.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Japanese exports in 2005]]\n{{See also|Japanese post-war economic miracle|Economic history of Japan}}\n\nFrom the 1960s to the 1980s, overall real economic growth was extremely large: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and a 4% average in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-7176.html | title = Japan: Patterns of Development | publisher = country-data.com |date=January 1994 | accessdate=28 December 2006}}</ref> By the end of said period, Japan had moved into being a high-wage economy.<ref>Business in context: an introduction to business and its environment by David Needle</ref>\n\nGrowth slowed markedly in the late 1990s also termed [[Lost Decade (Japan)|the Lost Decade]] after the collapse of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]]. As a consequence Japan ran massive budget deficits (added trillions in Yen to Japanese financial system) to finance large [[public works]] programs.\n\nBy 1998, Japan's public works projects still could not stimulate demand enough to end the economy's stagnation. In desperation, the Japanese government undertook \"structural reform\" policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Unfortunately, these policies led Japan into deflation on numerous occasions between 1999 and 2004. The Bank of Japan used [[quantitative easing]] to expand the country's money supply in order to raise expectations of inflation and spur economic growth. Initially, the policy failed to induce any growth, but it eventually began to affect inflationary expectations. By late 2005, the economy finally began what seems to be a sustained recovery. GDP growth for that year was 2.8%, with an annualized fourth quarter expansion of 5.5%, surpassing the growth rates of the US and [[Economy of the European Union|European Union]] during the same period.<ref>Masake, Hisane.

It is considered an important element in any major change, before any formal steps are taken, and successful ''nemawashi'' enables changes to be carried out with the consent of all sides.\n\nJapanese companies are known for management methods such as \"[[The Toyota Way]]\". [[Kaizen]] ([[wikt:\u6539\u5584|\u6539\u5584]], Japanese for \"improvement\") is a Japanese philosophy that focuses on continuous improvement throughout all aspects of life. When applied to the workplace, Kaizen activities continually improve all functions of a business, from manufacturing to management and from the CEO to the assembly line workers.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Imai\n | first = Masaaki\n | title = Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success\n | location = New York, NY\n | publisher = Random House\n | year = 1986\n}}</ref> By improving standardized activities and processes, Kaizen aims to eliminate waste (see [[Lean manufacturing]]). Kaizen was first implemented in several Japanese businesses during the country's recovery after World War II, including Toyota, and has since spread to businesses throughout the world.<ref>Europe Japan Centre, Kaizen Strategies for Improving Team Performance, Ed. Michael Colenso, London: Pearson Education Limited, 2000</ref> Within certain value systems, it is ironic that Japanese workers labor amongst the most hours per day, even though kaizen is supposed to improve all aspects of life. According to the OECD, annual hours worked per employee is below the OECD average and in the middle among G7 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.oecd.org/chart/5Stk|title=Interactive charts by the OECD|website=OECD Data|language=en|accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome companies have powerful enterprise unions and ''[[shunt\u014d]]''.  The [[Nenko System]] or Nenko Joretsu, as it is called in Japan, is the Japanese system of promoting an employee based on his or her proximity to [[retirement]]. The advantage of the system is that it allows older employees to achieve a higher salary level before retirement and it usually brings more experience to the executive ranks. The disadvantage of the system is that it does not allow new talent to be combined with experience and those with specialized skills cannot be promoted to the already crowded executive ranks. It also does not guarantee or even attempt to bring the \"right person for the right job\".\n\nRelationships between government bureaucrats and companies are often close. {{Nihongo|[[Amakudari]]|\u5929\u4e0b\u308a|amakudari|\"descent from heaven\"}} is the institutionalised practice where Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high-profile positions in the private and public sectors. The practice is increasingly viewed as corrupt and a limitation on efforts to reduce ties between the private sector and the state that prevent economic and political reforms.

Its frequent use by Japanese corporations, and its prevalence in Japanese [[manga]] and anime has gradually led to its acceptance in English-speaking countries as a noun for a Japanese [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] businessman. The word can be found in many books and articles pertaining to Japanese culture. Immediately following World War II, becoming a salaryman was viewed as a gateway to a stable, middle-class lifestyle. In modern use, the term carries associations of long working hours, low prestige in the corporate hierarchy, absence of significant sources of income other than salary, [[wage slavery]], and [[kar\u014dshi]]. The term salaryman refers almost exclusively to males.\n\nAn [[office lady]], often abbreviated OL (Japanese: \u30aa\u30fc\u30a8\u30eb ''\u014ceru''), is a female [[office worker]] in Japan who performs generally [[pink collar]] tasks such as serving tea and [[secretary|secretarial]] or [[clerk (position)|clerical]] work. Like many unmarried Japanese, OLs often [[parasite single|live with their parents]] well into [[early adulthood]]. Office ladies are usually [[Full-time job|full-time]] permanent staff, although the jobs they do usually have little opportunity for [[promotion (rank)|promotion]], and there is usually the [[wikt:tacit|tacit]] expectation that they leave their jobs once they get married.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[Freeter]]|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc|fur\u012bt\u0101}} is a Japanese expression for people between the age of 15 and 34 who lack full-time employment or are unemployed, excluding homemakers and students. They may also be described as ''[[underemployment|underemployed]]'' or [[freelance]] workers. These people do not start a [[career]] after [[Secondary education in Japan|high school]] or [[List of universities in Japan|university]] but instead usually live as [[parasite single]]s with their parents and earn some money with low skilled and low paid jobs. The low income makes it difficult for freeters to start a family, and the lack of qualifications makes it difficult to start a career at a later point in life.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[Kar\u014dshi]]|\u904e\u52b4\u6b7b|''kar\u014dshi''}}, which can be translated quite literally from Japanese as \"[[death from overwork]]\", is occupational sudden death. The major medical causes of kar\u014dshi deaths are heart attack and stroke due to stress.\n\n{{Nihongo|[[S\u014dkaiya]]|\u7dcf\u4f1a\u5c4b|s\u014dkaiya}}, (sometimes also translated as ''corporate bouncers'', ''meeting-men'', or ''corporate blackmailers'') are a form of specialized [[racketeer]] unique to Japan, and often associated with the [[yakuza]] that extort money from or blackmail companies by threatening to publicly [[Humiliation|humiliate]] companies and their management, usually in their {{Nihongo|annual meeting|\u7dcf\u4f1a|s\u014dkai}}.  {{Nihongo|[[Sarakin]]|\u30b5\u30e9\u91d1}} is a Japanese term for moneylender, or [[loan shark]]. It is a contraction of the Japanese words for [[salaryman]] and cash. Around 14 million people, or 10% of the Japanese population, have borrowed from a ''sarakin''. In total, there are about 10,000 firms (down from 30,000 a decade ago); however, the top seven firms make up 70% of the market. The value of outstanding loans totals $100 billion. The biggest ''sarakin'' are publicly traded and often allied with [[List of banks in Japan|big banks]].<ref name=\"economist\">[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11413090 Lenders of first resort], ''The Economist'', 22 May 2008</ref>\n\nThe first \"Western-style\" [[department stores in Japan|department store in Japan]] was [[Mitsukoshi]], founded in 1904, which has its root as a [[kimono]] store called Echigoya from 1673. When the roots are considered, however, [[Matsuzakaya]] has an even longer history, dated from 1611. The kimono store changed to a department store in 1910. In 1924, Matsuzakaya store in [[Ginza]] allowed street shoes to be worn indoors, something innovative at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matsuzakaya.co.jp/corporate/history/honshi/index.shtml |title=\u677e\u5742\u5c4b\u300c\u3072\u3068\u30fb\u3053\u3068\u30fb\u3082\u306e\u300d\u8a9e\u308a |publisher=Matsuzakaya.co.jp |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref> These former kimono shop department stores dominated the market in its earlier history. They sold, or rather displayed, luxurious products, which contributed for their sophisticated atmospheres. Another origin of Japanese department store is that from railway company. There have been many [[private railway]] operators in the nation, and from the 1920s, they started to build department stores directly linked to their lines' [[Terminal train station|termini]]. [[Seibu Department Stores|Seibu]] and [[Hankyu Department Stores|Hankyu]] are the typical examples of this type.  From the 1980s onwards, Japanese department stores face fierce competition from supermarkets and convenience stores, gradually losing their presences. Still, ''dep\u0101to'' are bastions of several aspects of cultural conservatism in the country. Gift certificates for prestigious department stores are frequently given as formal presents in Japan. Department stores in Japan generally offer a wide range of services and can include [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], travel reservations, ticket sales for local concerts and other events.\n\n===Keiretsu===\n{{Main|Keiretsu}}\nA {{Nihongo|[[keiretsu]]|\u7cfb\u5217|extra=\"system\" or \"series\"}} is a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. It is a type of [[business group]]. The prototypical ''keiretsu'' appeared in Japan during the \"[[Japanese post-war economic miracle|economic miracle]]\" following World War II. Before Japan's surrender, Japanese industry was controlled by large family-controlled [[vertical monopoly|vertical monopolies]] called ''[[zaibatsu]]''. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] dismantled the ''zaibatsu'' in the late 1940s, but the companies formed from the dismantling of the ''zaibatsu'' were reintegrated.  The dispersed corporations were re-interlinked through share purchases to form horizontally integrated alliances across many industries. Where possible, ''keiretsu'' companies would also supply one another, making the alliances vertically integrated as well.  In this period, official government policy promoted the creation of robust trade corporations that could withstand pressures from intensified world trade competition.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1954/07/17/archives/japan-again-plans-huge-corporations.html?sq=ogasawara&scp=46&st=p  \"Japan Again Plans Huge Corporations,\"] ''New York Times.'' 17 July 1954.</ref>\n\nThe major ''keiretsu'' were each centered on one bank, which lent money to the ''keiretsu's'' member companies and held equity positions in the companies. Each central bank had great control over the companies in the ''keiretsu'' and acted as a monitoring entity and as an emergency bail-out entity. One effect of this structure was to minimize the presence of [[hostile takeover]]s in Japan, because no entities could challenge the power of the banks.\n\nThere are two types of ''keiretsu'': vertical and horizontal. Vertical ''keiretsu'' illustrates the organization and relationships within a company (for example all factors of production of a certain product are connected), while a horizontal ''keiretsu'' shows relationships between entities and industries, normally centered on a bank and trading company. Both are complexly woven together and sustain each other.\n\nThe Japanese recession in the 1990s had profound effects on the keiretsu. Many of the largest banks were hit hard by bad loan portfolios and forced to merge or go out of business. This had the effect of blurring the lines between the keiretsu: [[Sumitomo Bank]] and [[Mitsui]] Bank, for instance, became [[Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation]] in 2001, while [[Sanwa Bank]] (the banker for the Hankyu-Toho Group) became part of [[Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ]]. Additionally, many companies from outside the keiretsu system, such as [[Sony]], began outperforming their counterparts within the system.\n\nGenerally, these causes gave rise to a strong notion in the business community that the old keiretsu system was not an effective business model, and led to an overall loosening of keiretsu alliances. While the keiretsu still exist, they are not as centralized or integrated as they were before the 1990s. This, in turn, has led to a growing [[corporate acquisition]] industry in Japan, as companies are no longer able to be easily \"bailed out\" by their banks, as well as rising [[derivative litigation]] by more independent shareholders.\n\n== Mergers and Acquisitions ==\nJapanese companies have been involved in 50,759 deals between 1985 and 2018. This cumulates to a total value of 2,636 bil. USD which translates to 281,469.9 bil.

It is made up of four separate systems that serve each part of the UK: The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] in England, [[NHS Scotland]], [[NHS Wales]], and [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland]]. They were established together in 1948 as one of the major social reforms following the [[World War II|Second World War]].  The founding principles were that services should be comprehensive, universal and free at the point of delivery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/nhscoreprinciples.aspx|title=The principles and values of the NHS in England |last= Choices|first=NHS|website=www.nhs.uk|access-date=2016-11-23}}</ref> Each service provides a comprehensive range of [[health services]], free at the point of use for people ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, apart from dental treatment and optical care.<ref name=entitle>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-entitlements-migrant-health-guide |title=NHS entitlements: migrant health guide \u2013 Detailed guidance|website=UK Government|date=  |author= |accessdate= 6 June 2016}}</ref>  The English NHS also requires patients to pay [[prescription charges]] with a range of exemptions from these charges.\n\nEach of the UK's health service systems operates independently, and is politically accountable to the relevant government: the [[Scottish Government]], [[Welsh Government]], [[Northern Ireland Executive]], and the [[UK Government]], responsible for England's NHS. Since 2013 operational responsibility for the NHS in England has been passed to NHS England.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/2018-05/worlds_biggest_quango_ifg_may2017.pdf|title=The first five years of NHS England|last=Timmins|first=Nicholas|date=24 May 2018|website=Institute for Government and The Kings Fund|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> NHS Wales was originally part of the same structure as that of England until powers over the NHS in Wales were first transferred to the [[Secretary of State for Wales]] in 1969 and thereafter, in 1999, to the [[Welsh Assembly]] as part of Welsh devolution. Some functions may be routinely performed by one health service on behalf of another. For example, Northern Ireland has no high-security [[psychiatric hospital]]s and depends on hospitals in Great Britain, routinely at [[State Hospital|Carstairs hospital]] in Scotland for male patients and [[Rampton Secure Hospital]] in England for female patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/publications/guidance-transfer-mentally-disordered-patients-august-2011|title=Guidance on the Transfer of Mentally Disordered Patients August 2011|publisher=}}</ref> Similarly, patients in North Wales use specialist facilities in Manchester and Liverpool which are much closer than facilities in Cardiff, and more routine services at the [[Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust|Countess of Chester Hospital]].

During very long waits for treatment, one in three patients deteriorate, and they may become unemployed or get divorced.

On 7 January 2019, the NHS England published the [[NHS Long Term Plan]].\n\n===Electronic systems===\n21 different electronic systems are used in the NHS to record data on patients.  These systems do not communicate well with each other so there is a risk doctors treating a patient will not know everything they need to know to treat the patient effectively.  There were 11 million patient interactions out of 121 million where information from a previous visit could not be accessed.  Half the Trusts using Electronic Medical Records used one of three systems and at least those three should be able to share information.  A tenth of Trusts used multiple systems in the same hospital.  Dr Leigh Warren who participated in the research said, \"Hospitals and GPs often don't have the right information about the right patient in the right place at the right time.  This can lead to errors and accidents that can threaten patients' lives.\"<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50675361 NHS e-health systems 'risk patient safety'] 7 December 2019 ''[[BBC]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Sale of data===\nInformation on millions of NHS patients was sold to international pharmaceutical companies, in the US and other nations for research, adding to concerns over USA ambitions to access remunerative parts of the NHS after Brexit.  There is concern over lack of transparency and clarity over the data and how it is used.  Phil Booth of medConfidential[https://medconfidential.org/], campaigning for privacy of health data said, \u201cPatients should know how their data is used. There should be no surprises. While legitimate research for public health benefit is to be encouraged, it must always be consensual, safe and properly transparent.   Do patients know \u2013 have they even been told by the one in seven GP practices across England that pass on their clinical details \u2013 that their medical histories are being sold to multinational pharma companies in the US and around the world?\u201d<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/07/nhs-medical-data-sales-american-pharma-lack-transparency Patient data from GP surgeries sold to US companies] 7 December 2019 ''[[The Observer]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Medicines===\nIn November 2019 unprecedented shortages of medicines patients need developed.  Drugs to treat cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, mental health conditions, some eye conditions, antibiotics for tuberculosis and drugs to control epilepsy are among those in short supply.  Life saving drugs will have to be rationed and not all patients who need them will get them.  Some patients can be switched onto other drugs, though this may increase the workload of hard-pressed medical staff; other patients cannot be switched to alternative drugs.  Many problems can impact the supply chain, like IT failure, speculators stockpiling drugs, alterations in regulation and sudden disease outbreaks.  Dr Tony O\u2019Sullivan of [[Keep Our NHS Public]] said, \u201cThe Health Department\u2019s guidance includes an unprecedented list of drugs unavailable or in short supply. Patients and clinicians alike should be on high alert when the advice includes how to \u2018share stocks\u2019 to make them last, to \u2018prioritise\u2019 patients already on specific treatments including cancer rather than a new patient and effectively how to ration so many vital drugs. Drug companies\u2019 behaviour must be controlled. We must urgently protect the NHS from further risks of loss of control of drug prices and supplies from trade deals with the US and that requires returning it to a wholly public service.\u201d<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/18/revealed-nhs-running-short-of-dozens-of-lifesaving-medicines Revealed: NHS running short of dozens of lifesaving medicines] 18 November 2019 ''[[The Guardian]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50465563 Britain's 'unprecedented' drug shortage] 19 November 2019 ''[[BBC]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>\n\n==Numbers==\nIn 2015, the UK had 2.6 hospital beds per 1,000 people.<ref>[https://www.nhsconfed.org/resources/key-statistics-on-the-nhs NHS statistics, facts and figures] 14 July 2017 ''www.nhsconfed.org'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref> In September 2017, the [[Kings fund]] documented the number of NHS hospital beds in England as 142,000, describing this as less than 50% of the number 30 years previously.<ref>[https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/nhs-hospital-bed-numbers  NHS hospital bed numbers: past, present, future] 29 September 2017 ''www.kingsfund.org.uk'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of the National Health Service (England)|History of the NHS England]]\n*[[History of NHS Scotland]]\n*[[History of NHS Wales]]\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[Healthcare in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Health in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{colbegin}}\n* Brady, Robert A.

Although being freely accessible regardless of wealth maintained Henry Willink's  principle of free healthcare for all, Conservative MPs were in favour of maintaining local administration of the NHS through existing arrangements with local authorities fearing that an NHS which owned hospitals on a national scale would lose the personal relationship between doctor and patient.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1946/apr/30/national-health-service-bill|publisher= Hansard|date= 30 April 1946 |title=NHS Bill Second Reading}}</ref>\n\nConservative MPs voted in favour of their amendment to Bevan's Bill to maintain local control and ownership of hospitals and against Bevan's plan for national ownership of all hospitals. The Labour government defeated Conservative amendments and went ahead with the NHS as it remains today;  a single large national organisation (with devolved equivalents) which forced the transfer of ownership of hospitals from local authorities and charities to the new NHS. Bevan's principle of ownership with no private sector involvement has since been diluted, with later Labour governments implementing large scale financing arrangements with private builders in [[private finance initiative]]s and joint ventures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/field/field_publication_file/perspectives-estates-nhs-property-nigel-edwards-jul13.pdf_|title=Kingsfund, July 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt its launch by Bevan on 5 July 1948 it had at its heart three core principles: That it meet the needs of everyone, that it be free at the point of delivery, and that it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/aboutnhs/Pages/NHSCorePrinciples.aspx |title=The NHS in England \u2013 About the NHS \u2013 NHS core principles |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=23 March 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThree years after the founding of the NHS, Bevan resigned from the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] in opposition to the introduction of charges for the provision of dentures and glasses.<ref>Kenneth O.

The failure to give people with mental illnesses the prompt help they need is ruining their lives.\u201d Even patients who are suicidal or who have attempted suicide are sometimes denied treatment; patients are told they are not ill enough or waiting lists are too long. During very long waits for treatment, one in three patients deteriorate, and they may become unemployed or get divorced. One in four patients throughout the UK wait over three months to see an NHS mental health professional, with 6% waiting at least a year.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/09/mental-health-patients-waiting-nhs-treatment-delays Delays in NHS mental health treatment 'ruining lives'] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>\n\nThe [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] found mental health provisions for children and young people will not meet growing demand, despite promises of increased funding.

On 7 January 2019, the NHS England published the [[NHS Long Term Plan]].\n\n===Electronic systems===\n21 different electronic systems are used in the NHS to record data on patients.  These systems do not communicate well with each other so there is a risk doctors treating a patient will not know everything they need to know to treat the patient effectively.  There were 11 million patient interactions out of 121 million where information from a previous visit could not be accessed.  Half the Trusts using Electronic Medical Records used one of three systems and at least those three should be able to share information.  A tenth of Trusts used multiple systems in the same hospital.  Dr Leigh Warren who participated in the research said, \"Hospitals and GPs often don't have the right information about the right patient in the right place at the right time.  This can lead to errors and accidents that can threaten patients' lives.\"<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50675361 NHS e-health systems 'risk patient safety'] 7 December 2019 ''[[BBC]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Sale of data===\nInformation on millions of NHS patients was sold to international pharmaceutical companies, in the US and other nations for research, adding to concerns over USA ambitions to access remunerative parts of the NHS after Brexit.  There is concern over lack of transparency and clarity over the data and how it is used.  Phil Booth of medConfidential[https://medconfidential.org/], campaigning for privacy of health data said, \u201cPatients should know how their data is used. There should be no surprises. While legitimate research for public health benefit is to be encouraged, it must always be consensual, safe and properly transparent.   Do patients know \u2013 have they even been told by the one in seven GP practices across England that pass on their clinical details \u2013 that their medical histories are being sold to multinational pharma companies in the US and around the world?\u201d<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/07/nhs-medical-data-sales-american-pharma-lack-transparency Patient data from GP surgeries sold to US companies] 7 December 2019 ''[[The Observer]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Medicines===\nIn November 2019 unprecedented shortages of medicines patients need developed.  Drugs to treat cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, mental health conditions, some eye conditions, antibiotics for tuberculosis and drugs to control epilepsy are among those in short supply.  Life saving drugs will have to be rationed and not all patients who need them will get them.  Some patients can be switched onto other drugs, though this may increase the workload of hard-pressed medical staff; other patients cannot be switched to alternative drugs.  Many problems can impact the supply chain, like IT failure, speculators stockpiling drugs, alterations in regulation and sudden disease outbreaks.  Dr Tony O\u2019Sullivan of [[Keep Our NHS Public]] said, \u201cThe Health Department\u2019s guidance includes an unprecedented list of drugs unavailable or in short supply. Patients and clinicians alike should be on high alert when the advice includes how to \u2018share stocks\u2019 to make them last, to \u2018prioritise\u2019 patients already on specific treatments including cancer rather than a new patient and effectively how to ration so many vital drugs. Drug companies\u2019 behaviour must be controlled. We must urgently protect the NHS from further risks of loss of control of drug prices and supplies from trade deals with the US and that requires returning it to a wholly public service.\u201d<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/18/revealed-nhs-running-short-of-dozens-of-lifesaving-medicines Revealed: NHS running short of dozens of lifesaving medicines] 18 November 2019 ''[[The Guardian]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50465563 Britain's 'unprecedented' drug shortage] 19 November 2019 ''[[BBC]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>\n\n==Numbers==\nIn 2015, the UK had 2.6 hospital beds per 1,000 people.<ref>[https://www.nhsconfed.org/resources/key-statistics-on-the-nhs NHS statistics, facts and figures] 14 July 2017 ''www.nhsconfed.org'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref> In September 2017, the [[Kings fund]] documented the number of NHS hospital beds in England as 142,000, describing this as less than 50% of the number 30 years previously.<ref>[https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/nhs-hospital-bed-numbers  NHS hospital bed numbers: past, present, future] 29 September 2017 ''www.kingsfund.org.uk'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of the National Health Service (England)|History of the NHS England]]\n*[[History of NHS Scotland]]\n*[[History of NHS Wales]]\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[Healthcare in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Health in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{colbegin}}\n* Brady, Robert A.

The new BCA gives an exchange ratio of 11.00 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share, up from the original agreement of 9.75 Sprint shares. SoftBank, Sprint\u2019s owner, has agreed to surrender 48.8 million T-Mobile shares acquired in the merger to the New T-Mobile, making SoftBank\u2019s effective ratio 11.31 shares per T-Mo share. Sprint shareholders other than SoftBank will continue to get the original fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for each Sprint share, or the equivalent of 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mo share. Following the closing of the merger, T-Mobile parent company Deutsche Telekom will hold approximately 43% of New T-Mobile\u2019s shares while SoftBank will hold 24% and the remaining 33% will be held by public shareholders. The previous deal saw DT getting 42%, SoftBank getting 27%, and public shareholders getting 31%.  The new agreement has an outside/long stop date of July 1, 2020, which is when either and/or both parties can walk away from the deal if it has not closed yet.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmonews.com/2020/02/t-mobile-sprint-updated-merger-agreement/|title=T-Mobile, Sprint confirm updated merger agreement|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.t-mobile.com/news/t-mobile-sprint-business-combination-agreement|title=T-Mobile and Sprint Announce Amendment to Business Combination Agreement|last=Bellevue|last2=Washington|website=www.t-mobile.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-21|last3=Overl|last4=Park|last5=February 20|first5=Kansas-|last6=2020 \u2013}}</ref>\n\nOn March 11, 2020, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced he will not appeal the judge\u2019s decision last month to reject the state AGs\u2019 lawsuit against the T-Mobile-Sprint merger.

The terms of the settlement include making its low-cost T-Mobile Connect plans available in California for at least 5 years, that T-Mobile customers can keep their T-Mobile plans held in February 2019 for a total of five years, to enact Project 10 Million, part of the New T-Mobile Un-carrier 1.0 move, that will offer a free hotspot device and 100GB of free broadband internet per year for five years to 10 million low-income households, for all current T-Mobile and Sprint employees in California must receive an offer of \u201csubstantially similar employment\u201d with New T-Mobile, to make the number of New T-Mobile employees in California will be equal to or greater than the current number of T-Mobile and Sprint employees, to open a new customer support center in Kingsburg, CA that will create approximately 1,000 new jobs, to increase participation in employee Diversity and Inclusion program to 60% within 3 years, and to reimburse California and other states that participated in merger lawsuit for the costs of the investigation and litigation, up to a total of $15 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmonews.com/2020/03/california-ag-xavier-becerra-not-appeal-judge-t-mobile-sprint-merger-ruling/|title=California AG Xavier Becerra will not appeal judge\u2019s T-Mobile-Sprint merger ruling|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> This is significant because he was the last of the two leaders in the lawsuit, the other being New York Attorney General Letita James.\n\nAlso on March 11, 2020, the [[California Public Utilities Commission]] announced a proposal to approve the merger.

In 2017 T-Mobile also acquired a nationwide 600&nbsp;MHz license. It expects to deploy this spectrum over the next few years as it is vacated by television stations across the country in stages. With respect to technology, depending on the location, in the 1900&nbsp;MHz band it deploys [[GSM]], [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]]/[[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]], and/or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] ([[LTE frequency bands|Band]] 2); in the 1700&nbsp;MHz band it deploys UMTS/HSPA+ and/or LTE (B4 and B66); and LTE-only in the 700&nbsp;MHz (B12) and 600&nbsp;MHz (B71) bands. Its LTE network also supports [[VoLTE]]. It provides coverage in areas where it does not own [[radio frequency]] spectrum licenses via roaming agreements with other operators of compatible networks.\n\n===Cellular network===\nThe company's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, began building a regional, [[2G]], 1900&nbsp;MHz GSM, circuit switched, digital cellular network in 1994 and first offered service in 1996 in [[Honolulu]] and [[Salt Lake City]]. From that starting point, the network has expanded in size through acquisitions of other cellular-network operators and additional spectrum purchases. The network has also expanded in capabilities through the introduction of new technologies. VoiceStream upgraded the 1900&nbsp;MHz network to include packet switching via [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), then increased packet switched data transmission speeds via [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]]. In 2006, the company spent $4.2 billion to purchase 120 D, E or F block 1700&nbsp;MHz AWS licenses<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cellularmaps.com/aws_auction.shtml |title=Cellular Maps.com-AWS Wireless Auction Results Maps |publisher=Cellularmaps.com |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref> and began rolling out [[3G]] UMTS services in those frequency bands. The company upgraded network equipment and [[back-haul]] capabilities to enable [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] (High Speed Packet Access), and later [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] services.\n[[File:T-Mobile Headquarters in Bellevue, WA.jpg|thumb|T-Mobile US headquarters in Bellevue, WA]]\n\n====Packet-switched data upgrade====\nPacket-switched data service first became available to users in the form of [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS). Packet-switched data speeds increased when [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE) was incorporated into the network. EDGE coverage was available within at least forty percent of the GSM footprint.<ref>T-Mobile USA's [https://web.archive.org/web/20090106054447/http://support.t-mobile.com/knowbase/root/public/tm22696.htm#top \"What is EDGE\"].  t-mobile.com.</ref>\n\nBoth voice capacity and packet-switched data speeds improved when 3G [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS) equipment was installed in the network. On January 5, 2010, the company announced that it had upgraded its entire 3G network to HSPA 7.2 Mbit/s, an improvement from its previous peak of 3.6 Mbit/s. It also said that it planned to be the first U.S. carrier to deploy [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] across its network by mid-2010. The company had finished HSPA+ trials in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and had begun deploying HSPA+ across its network.\n\n===={{anchor|3G AWS upgrade}}3G upgrade / discontinuation====\nIn September 2006, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) auctioned licenses in the first [[Advanced Wireless Services]] band. This band was an area of wireless [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], half in the 1700 [[MHz]] (1.7 [[GHz]]) and half in the 2100 [[MHz]] (2.1 [[GHz]]) frequencies, that was already in use by government services. The spectrum was planned to become available after the government users migrated to different frequencies.\n\nThe auction made numerous licenses available in overlapping market-areas, economic-areas, and regional levels. Each license was individually bid upon, and T-Mobile USA was the winner in 120 license auctions, at an aggregate price of $4.18 billion. As part of its winnings, T-Mobile USA gained nationwide coverage of 1.7&nbsp;GHz and 2.1&nbsp;GHz, with numerous areas being supplemented with additional licenses. Examples include New York City, Chicago, and Boston where T-Mobile USA acquired one-third (33 percent) of the available spectrum, or San Francisco, [[Houston]], and Miami where they acquired 45 percent of the available spectrum.<ref name=\"fcc_aws_results\">FCC's [http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/default.htm?job=auction_summary&id=66 \"Auction 66 Summary\"]. [[Federal Communications Commission]].</ref>\n\nOctober 6, 2006, two weeks after confirming its winning bids, the company announced its intentions to create a [[UMTS]] third-generation, or [[3G]], cellular network with the spectrum it had won. It said it would utilize and build on the experience of T-Mobile International's European subsidiaries, which already implemented 3G networks. At the time of initial roll-out, the company intended to offer 7.2 Mbit/s service, making the company's 3G network the fastest in the U.S. The upgrade was forecast to cost $2.6 billion, in addition to the $4.12 billion spent to acquire the spectrum licenses.<ref name=\"TMO_US_3G_announcement\">Rash, Wayne (October 6, 2006).

With the equipment in place, it would be able to activate its network as soon as the government agencies vacated the spectrum.

By doing so, all plans after a select amount of inclusive high-speed data, result in automatic throttled speeds, preventing unlimited high-speed tethering use and abuse of the network. T-Mobile stated that there are a small handful of users who abuse the tethering plan by altering device software and/or the use of an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app that masks T-Mobile's ability monitoring whether data is on-smartphone, or through smartphone mobile hotspot (tethering) by mimicking all data as on-smartphone use, with some customers abusing the service by using as much as 2 [[Terabyte|TB]] per month, causing speed issues for all other customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/31/9230595/t-mobile-unlimited-data-tethering-warning|title=T-Mobile will now punish customers who abuse unlimited data|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===InReach program===\nThe InReach program<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|title=InReach Program at T-Mobile US|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123043942/https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|archivedate=January 23, 2014}}</ref> provides a free cell phone and a limited number of voice minutes each month for [[low-income]]-eligible families (one per family) who do not use Lifeline services offered by any other phone or wireless company.

The new BCA gives an exchange ratio of 11.00 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share, up from the original agreement of 9.75 Sprint shares. SoftBank, Sprint\u2019s owner, has agreed to surrender 48.8 million T-Mobile shares acquired in the merger to the New T-Mobile, making SoftBank\u2019s effective ratio 11.31 shares per T-Mo share. Sprint shareholders other than SoftBank will continue to get the original fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for each Sprint share, or the equivalent of 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mo share. Following the closing of the merger, T-Mobile parent company Deutsche Telekom will hold approximately 43% of New T-Mobile\u2019s shares while SoftBank will hold 24% and the remaining 33% will be held by public shareholders. The previous deal saw DT getting 42%, SoftBank getting 27%, and public shareholders getting 31%.  The new agreement has an outside/long stop date of July 1, 2020, which is when either and/or both parties can walk away from the deal if it has not closed yet.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmonews.com/2020/02/t-mobile-sprint-updated-merger-agreement/|title=T-Mobile, Sprint confirm updated merger agreement|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.t-mobile.com/news/t-mobile-sprint-business-combination-agreement|title=T-Mobile and Sprint Announce Amendment to Business Combination Agreement|last=Bellevue|last2=Washington|website=www.t-mobile.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-21|last3=Overl|last4=Park|last5=February 20|first5=Kansas-|last6=2020 \u2013}}</ref>\n\nOn March 11, 2020, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced he will not appeal the judge\u2019s decision last month to reject the state AGs\u2019 lawsuit against the T-Mobile-Sprint merger.

In 2017 T-Mobile also acquired a nationwide 600&nbsp;MHz license. It expects to deploy this spectrum over the next few years as it is vacated by television stations across the country in stages. With respect to technology, depending on the location, in the 1900&nbsp;MHz band it deploys [[GSM]], [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]]/[[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]], and/or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] ([[LTE frequency bands|Band]] 2); in the 1700&nbsp;MHz band it deploys UMTS/HSPA+ and/or LTE (B4 and B66); and LTE-only in the 700&nbsp;MHz (B12) and 600&nbsp;MHz (B71) bands. Its LTE network also supports [[VoLTE]]. It provides coverage in areas where it does not own [[radio frequency]] spectrum licenses via roaming agreements with other operators of compatible networks.\n\n===Cellular network===\nThe company's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, began building a regional, [[2G]], 1900&nbsp;MHz GSM, circuit switched, digital cellular network in 1994 and first offered service in 1996 in [[Honolulu]] and [[Salt Lake City]]. From that starting point, the network has expanded in size through acquisitions of other cellular-network operators and additional spectrum purchases. The network has also expanded in capabilities through the introduction of new technologies. VoiceStream upgraded the 1900&nbsp;MHz network to include packet switching via [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), then increased packet switched data transmission speeds via [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]]. In 2006, the company spent $4.2 billion to purchase 120 D, E or F block 1700&nbsp;MHz AWS licenses<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cellularmaps.com/aws_auction.shtml |title=Cellular Maps.com-AWS Wireless Auction Results Maps |publisher=Cellularmaps.com |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref> and began rolling out [[3G]] UMTS services in those frequency bands. The company upgraded network equipment and [[back-haul]] capabilities to enable [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] (High Speed Packet Access), and later [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] services.\n[[File:T-Mobile Headquarters in Bellevue, WA.jpg|thumb|T-Mobile US headquarters in Bellevue, WA]]\n\n====Packet-switched data upgrade====\nPacket-switched data service first became available to users in the form of [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS). Packet-switched data speeds increased when [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE) was incorporated into the network. EDGE coverage was available within at least forty percent of the GSM footprint.<ref>T-Mobile USA's [https://web.archive.org/web/20090106054447/http://support.t-mobile.com/knowbase/root/public/tm22696.htm#top \"What is EDGE\"].  t-mobile.com.</ref>\n\nBoth voice capacity and packet-switched data speeds improved when 3G [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS) equipment was installed in the network. On January 5, 2010, the company announced that it had upgraded its entire 3G network to HSPA 7.2 Mbit/s, an improvement from its previous peak of 3.6 Mbit/s. It also said that it planned to be the first U.S. carrier to deploy [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] across its network by mid-2010. The company had finished HSPA+ trials in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and had begun deploying HSPA+ across its network.\n\n===={{anchor|3G AWS upgrade}}3G upgrade / discontinuation====\nIn September 2006, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) auctioned licenses in the first [[Advanced Wireless Services]] band. This band was an area of wireless [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], half in the 1700 [[MHz]] (1.7 [[GHz]]) and half in the 2100 [[MHz]] (2.1 [[GHz]]) frequencies, that was already in use by government services. The spectrum was planned to become available after the government users migrated to different frequencies.\n\nThe auction made numerous licenses available in overlapping market-areas, economic-areas, and regional levels. Each license was individually bid upon, and T-Mobile USA was the winner in 120 license auctions, at an aggregate price of $4.18 billion. As part of its winnings, T-Mobile USA gained nationwide coverage of 1.7&nbsp;GHz and 2.1&nbsp;GHz, with numerous areas being supplemented with additional licenses. Examples include New York City, Chicago, and Boston where T-Mobile USA acquired one-third (33 percent) of the available spectrum, or San Francisco, [[Houston]], and Miami where they acquired 45 percent of the available spectrum.<ref name=\"fcc_aws_results\">FCC's [http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/default.htm?job=auction_summary&id=66 \"Auction 66 Summary\"]. [[Federal Communications Commission]].</ref>\n\nOctober 6, 2006, two weeks after confirming its winning bids, the company announced its intentions to create a [[UMTS]] third-generation, or [[3G]], cellular network with the spectrum it had won. It said it would utilize and build on the experience of T-Mobile International's European subsidiaries, which already implemented 3G networks. At the time of initial roll-out, the company intended to offer 7.2 Mbit/s service, making the company's 3G network the fastest in the U.S. The upgrade was forecast to cost $2.6 billion, in addition to the $4.12 billion spent to acquire the spectrum licenses.<ref name=\"TMO_US_3G_announcement\">Rash, Wayne (October 6, 2006).

With the equipment in place, it would be able to activate its network as soon as the government agencies vacated the spectrum.

By doing so, all plans after a select amount of inclusive high-speed data, result in automatic throttled speeds, preventing unlimited high-speed tethering use and abuse of the network. T-Mobile stated that there are a small handful of users who abuse the tethering plan by altering device software and/or the use of an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app that masks T-Mobile's ability monitoring whether data is on-smartphone, or through smartphone mobile hotspot (tethering) by mimicking all data as on-smartphone use, with some customers abusing the service by using as much as 2 [[Terabyte|TB]] per month, causing speed issues for all other customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/31/9230595/t-mobile-unlimited-data-tethering-warning|title=T-Mobile will now punish customers who abuse unlimited data|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===InReach program===\nThe InReach program<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|title=InReach Program at T-Mobile US|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123043942/https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|archivedate=January 23, 2014}}</ref> provides a free cell phone and a limited number of voice minutes each month for [[low-income]]-eligible families (one per family) who do not use Lifeline services offered by any other phone or wireless company.

[[Edward Markey]] revealed responses from the top four U.S. wireless providers as well as U.S. Cellular, C Spire, and Cricket/Leap Wireless, to his inquiry regarding user information disclosed to law enforcement officials. The following was T-Mobile's response regarding data retention: T-Mobile US retains customers' historic cell site information and cell tower dump information (180 days); call details records (7\u201310 years); text message content, data requests, and geo-location data not stored; voicemail content (up to 21 days); subscriber information (6 years after account is closed).<ref>[http://uk.pcmag.com/smartphones/11539/news/wireless-carriers-reveal-user-data-requests Mobile Phone Reviews: Wireless Carriers Reveal User Data Requests<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nComparing the 2010 DOJ memo released by the ACLU and Markey's 2013 wireless data retention disclosures, T-Mobile increased the retention period for subscriber information from 5 to 6 years. T-Mobile also increased its call detail record retention from 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid) to 7\u201310 years.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Companies|Telecommunication|United States}}\n* [[List of companies based in Bellevue, Washington]]\n* [[List of United States wireless communications service providers]]\n* [[List of mobile network operators of the Americas]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* [http://www.telekom.com/  Deutsche Telekom AG's homepage ]\n* [https://www.metropcs.com/ MetroPCS's official website]\n\n{{Finance links\n| name = T-Mobile US\n| symbol = TMUS\n| sec_cik = TMUS\n| reuters = TMUS.O\n| bloomberg = TMUS:US\n| yahoo = TMUS\n| google = TMUS\n}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list =\n{{Deutsche Telekom}}\n{{United States mobile communications brands}}\n{{Caribbean mobile phone companies}}\n{{Puerto Rico mobile phone companies}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Seattle Corporations}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n|state=expanded\n}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Mobile phone companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Wi-Fi providers]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Bellevue, Washington]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies established in 1994]]\n[[Category:Retail companies established in 1994]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1994]]\n[[Category:Deutsche Telekom]]\n[[Category:American subsidiaries of foreign companies]]\n[[Category:2013 initial public offerings]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: it's \u2192 its, tidied an oddly-coded wikilink.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_US"}

But at that time, since he lacked the height, no one took notice of him. However, he had a growth spurt by the time he was in third year so he was taken into the high school basketball team of [[Don Bosco Technical College-Cebu]].\n\nHis first year with the varsity team was spent mostly on the bench. By the time he became a high school senior, he was already part of the team's rotation. At this point, he was already as tall as the team's center. His jump to college basketball suffered a minor setback when he ended his senior high school year with an injury. To keep himself competitive, he played in the intramural games at [[University of San Jose\u2013Recoletos]].\n\nHe eventually played college ball at the [[University of Cebu]] for three years.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Metropolitan Basketball Association===\nHontiveros joined the [[Metropolitan Basketball Association]] in its maiden season in 1998 playing for the [[Cebu Gems]].  However, despite being a fan favorite among the Cebuano fans, his stint with the Gems was marred with chaos, as he requested to be released by the team because he wanted to finish his studies and the constant travelling to different provinces with the team prompted him to drop some of his subjects.<ref>{{ cite web |last1=Henson |first1=Joaquin |title=Dondon case to be resolved soon - Gems |url=http://www.philstar.com/sports/97839/dondon-case-be-resolved-soon-gems |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |date=January 29, 2000 |accessdate=November 10, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Philippine Basketball Association===\nThe Cebu Gems management tried to trade Hontiveros to different MBA teams. But Hontiveros' desire to play for the PBA eventually materialized as the Gems strike an agreement with [[Tanduay Rhum Masters]], who acquired Hontiveros in exchange for cash. But after Tanduay franchise was sold to the Lina Group in 2002, [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel]] (his favorite team) acquired him through a trade. Soon, he found himself a vital cog in the team's offensive rotation as he was quickly promoted as a starter for the team. He was a member of the two championships won by San Miguel in 2004-2005 Fiesta Conference and the 2009 Fiesta Conference.\n\nIn March 2011, he, along with Danny Seigle, Dorian Pena and Paul Artadi were shipped to Air21 for younger players [[Rabeh Al-Hussaini]], [[Nonoy Baclao]] and [[Rey Guevarra]].

However, he had a growth spurt by the time he was in third year so he was taken into the high school basketball team of [[Don Bosco Technical College-Cebu]].\n\nHis first year with the varsity team was spent mostly on the bench. By the time he became a high school senior, he was already part of the team's rotation. At this point, he was already as tall as the team's center. His jump to college basketball suffered a minor setback when he ended his senior high school year with an injury. To keep himself competitive, he played in the intramural games at [[University of San Jose\u2013Recoletos]].\n\nHe eventually played college ball at the [[University of Cebu]] for three years.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Metropolitan Basketball Association===\nHontiveros joined the [[Metropolitan Basketball Association]] in its maiden season in 1998 playing for the [[Cebu Gems]].  However, despite being a fan favorite among the Cebuano fans, his stint with the Gems was marred with chaos, as he requested to be released by the team because he wanted to finish his studies and the constant travelling to different provinces with the team prompted him to drop some of his subjects.<ref>{{ cite web |last1=Henson |first1=Joaquin |title=Dondon case to be resolved soon - Gems |url=http://www.philstar.com/sports/97839/dondon-case-be-resolved-soon-gems |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |date=January 29, 2000 |accessdate=November 10, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Philippine Basketball Association===\nThe Cebu Gems management tried to trade Hontiveros to different MBA teams. But Hontiveros' desire to play for the PBA eventually materialized as the Gems strike an agreement with [[Tanduay Rhum Masters]], who acquired Hontiveros in exchange for cash. But after Tanduay franchise was sold to the Lina Group in 2002, [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel]] (his favorite team) acquired him through a trade. Soon, he found himself a vital cog in the team's offensive rotation as he was quickly promoted as a starter for the team. He was a member of the two championships won by San Miguel in 2004-2005 Fiesta Conference and the 2009 Fiesta Conference.\n\nIn March 2011, he, along with Danny Seigle, Dorian Pena and Paul Artadi were shipped to Air21 for younger players [[Rabeh Al-Hussaini]], [[Nonoy Baclao]] and [[Rey Guevarra]]. During his stint with the Express, he emerged as one of the key players  In [[2011 PBA draft|2011 draft-day]], he was traded back to Petron (San Miguel) along with the No.3 pick which was used to draft [[Chris Lutz]].\n\nBefore the end of August 2012, he was involved in a six-player, four-team trade that sent him to Alaska.<ref>{{ cite news |title=Monster trade involving Tenorio, Casio balanced, says Salud |url=http://www.pba-online.net/pba/Monster-trade-involving-Tenorio-Casio-balanced-says-Salud/14151/ |work=PBA-Online! |date=August 31, 2012 |accessdate=November 10, 2015 }}</ref> He was a vital addition off-the-bench for the Aces, and was a member of the 2013 championship team.

He was the game's best player once during the elimination round against NLEX, and would provide his usual heroics in the playoffs, once against Rain or Shine and another during the Game 6 (a potential elimination game) against San Miguel in the Finals.\n\nOn January 16, 2015, he surpassed fellow Cebuano gunner Al Solis for the No. 4 all time in three-point field goals with 1,002.<ref>{{ cite news |last1=Panaligan |first1=Marisse |title=PBA: Dondon Hontiveros reaches elite three-point shooting milestone |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/407358/sports/basketball/pba-dondon-hontiveros-reaches-elite-three-point-shooting-milestone |work=[[GMA News and Public Affairs]] |date=January 17, 2015 |accessdate=January 21, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===ASEAN Basketball League===\nAfter finishing his contract with Alaska, Hontiveros was signed by [[ASEAN Basketball League]] (ABL) team [[Alab Pilipinas]].<ref>{{ cite news |last=Terrado |first=Reuben |title=Dondon Hontiveros takes act to ABL after 17 years in the PBA |url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/abl/news/dondon-hontiveros-alab-pilipinas-asean-basketball-league |work=Spin.ph |date=October 17, 2017 |accessdate=October 17, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==PBA career statistics==\n{{PBA player statistics legend}}\n<ref>[http://stats.humblebola.com/pba/players/28-Hontiveros-Dondon]</ref>\n\n===Season-by-season averages===\n{{PBA player statistics start}} \n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2000}}\n| align=left | [[Tanduay Rhum Masters|Tanduay]]\n| 44 ||\t25.9 || .389 || .273 || .729 || 2.6 ||\t1.6 ||\t.5 ||\t.2 ||\t10.2\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2001}}\n| align=left | Tanduay\n| 38 ||\t29.8 || .386 || '''.406''' || .646 || 3.9 ||\t1.9 ||\t.6 ||\t.4 ||\t12.5\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2002}}\n| align=left | [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel]]\n| 13 ||\t32.5 || .413 || .333 || .632 || 4.6 ||\t2.5 ||\t.5 ||\t.5 ||\t11.9\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2003}}\n| align=left | San Miguel\n| 50 ||\t33.3 || .417 || .368 || .831 || 4.6 ||\t2.1 ||\t.8 ||\t'''.7''' ||\t12.8\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2004}}\n| align=left | San Miguel\n| '''77''' ||\t'''34.7''' || .416 || .320 || .729 || 4.4 ||\t2.5 ||\t1.0 ||\t'''.7''' ||\t12.6\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2005}}\n| align=left | San Miguel\n| 42 ||\t32.1 || .382 || .359 || .754 || 4.1 ||\t2.1 ||\t.9 ||\t.5 ||\t10.6\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2006}}\n| align=left | San Miguel\n| 31 ||\t30.5 || .346 || .310 || .739 || '''4.8''' ||\t'''3.7''' ||\t.7 ||\t.3 ||\t12.8\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2007}}\n| align=left | Magnolia\n| 44 ||\t28.9 \t || .415 || .314 || .778 || 4.0 ||\t2.7 ||\t'''1.3''' ||\t.6 ||\t11.7\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2008}}\n| align=left | San Miguel\n| 57 ||\t29.8 || .437 || .379 || .812 || 4.5 ||\t2.3 ||\t.9 ||\t.5 ||\t'''14.8'''\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2009}}\n| align=left | San Miguel\n| 56 ||\t28.4 || '''.443''' || .376 || .710 || 3.4 ||\t1.8 ||\t.6 ||\t.3 ||\t11.8\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2010}}\n| align=left | San Miguel\n| 49 ||\t32.3 || .418 || .377 || .739 || 4.0 ||\t2.0 ||\t.9 ||\t.4 ||\t13.5\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2011}}\n| align=left | Petron\n| 9 ||\t12.8 || .243 || .250 || .375 || 2.0 ||\t.6 ||\t.1 ||\t.0 ||\t2.9\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2012}}\n| align=left | [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska]]\n| 55 ||\t22.2 || .319 || .294 || .811 || 2.9 ||\t1.6 ||\t.4 ||\t.3 ||\t6.2\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2013}}\n| align=left | Alaska\n| 44 ||\t21.8 || .342 || .358 || .596 || 3.0 ||\t1.1 ||\t.5 ||\t.1 ||\t6.2\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2014}}\n| align=left | Alaska\n| 57 ||\t21.3 || .359 || .343 || .758 || 2.5 ||\t1.2 ||\t.5 ||\t.2 ||\t7.6\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2015}}\n| align=left | Alaska\n| 57 ||\t15.2 || .376 || .338 || '''.837''' || 1.5 ||\t.9 ||\t.4 ||\t.1 ||\t5.7\n|-\n| align=left | {{pbay|2016}}\n| align=left | Alaska\n| 21 ||\t11.5 || .317 || .321 || .500 || 1.4 ||\t.8 ||\t.1 ||\t.0 || 3.5\n|-class=sortbottom\n| align=center colspan=2 | Career\n| 744 || 26.1 || .378 || .336 || .704 || 3.4 ||\t1.8 ||\t.6 ||\t.3 || 9.8\n{{end}}\n\n==International career==\nHontiveros played for the Philippine National Team in 2002 and 2007.
