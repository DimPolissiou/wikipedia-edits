In April 1965 the U.S. Army Aviation Brigade (Provisional) was activated with the existing [[13th Aviation Battalion|13th]], [[14th Aviation Battalion|14th]], [[52nd Aviation Regiment (United States)|52nd]], and [[145th Aviation Battalion]]s,<ref group=\"Note\">September 24th, 1963 brought to a close the 45th Transportation Battalion and gave birth to the 145th Combat Aviation Battalion.</ref> already in South Vietnam, reporting to it. In August 1965 it became the [[12th Combat Aviation Brigade|12th Aviation Group]], which then doubled in size and was used to form the 1st Aviation Brigade in March 1966.<ref name=\"1AVNB\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.1stavnbde.com/|title=Portal - 1st Aviation Brigade - U.S. Army, Vietnam|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401212829/http://www.1stavnbde.com/|archive-date=1 April 2016|access-date=12 May 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Dunstan, in ''Vietnam Choppers'' writes that the numerous independent aviation companies deployed during the war's early years had become difficult to move between sectors because they had developed 'individual means of operating in conjunction with the formations they supported.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dunstan |first1=Simon |title=Vietnam choppers: helicopters in battle 1950-1975 |date=2003 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=0850455723 |page=37}}</ref> Thus the brigade was formed to achieve standardization.\n\nBrigadier General [[George P. Seneff]], the Staff Aviation Officer at [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] (MACV), became the brigade commander. Because the requirements varied in each part of Vietnam, the brigade tried to collocate one assault helicopter company with each U.S. brigade and in course of time each Republic of Korea brigade.<ref name=1AVNB /> The companies supporting [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] units were located in centralized positions to best provide support. The brigade assigned one combat aviation battalion headquarters in direct support of each infantry division and this battalion headquarters normally worked with that division no matter how many companies might be assigned for a specific mission. The Brigade [[Headquarters and headquarters company (United States)|Headquarters and Headquarters Company]] was located in Saigon from May 1966 until August 1967.  Then the HQ moved to [[Long Binh Post|Long Binh]] where it remained until Long Binh was closed in the early autumn of 1972. The HQ then moved to the MACV compound at [[Tan Son Nhut]], where it stayed until withdrawal.\n\nAt this time the 52nd Aviation Battalion supported the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] in the highlands, the 10th Aviation Battalion supported the brigade of the 101st and the Republic of Korea division, the 11th Combat Aviation Battalion supported the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]], the 214th\u2014the 9th Division, and the [[269th Aviation Battalion]]\u2014the 25th Division. The 13th Battalion, which was later to become a full group, remained in the [[Mekong Delta]]. Two aviation groups\u2014the [[17th Aviation Brigade (United States)|17th]] and the 12th\u2014supervised the aviation assets in the [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II]] and [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps Tactical Zone]]s respectively. The aviation group commander was also the aviation officer for the U.S. Field Force commander.\n\nDuring June 1970, the 1st Aviation Brigade reached its largest size, at which point it contained four combat aviation groups, 16 combat aviation battalions, and 83 companies totaling over 4,000 aircraft and 27,000 personnel.<ref group=\"Note\">Constituted 25 April 1966 in the Regular Army as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 222d Aviation Battalion. Activated 25 May 1966 in Vietnam.</ref> The 34th General Support Group (Aviation Maintenance and Supply) was transferred to the control of 1st Aviation Brigade in November 1971 where it continued in operation well into 1972.

In April 1965 the U.S. Army Aviation Brigade (Provisional) was activated with the existing [[13th Aviation Battalion|13th]], [[14th Aviation Battalion|14th]], [[52nd Aviation Regiment (United States)|52nd]], and [[145th Aviation Battalion]]s,<ref group=\"Note\">September 24th, 1963 brought to a close the 45th Transportation Battalion and gave birth to the 145th Combat Aviation Battalion.</ref> already in South Vietnam, reporting to it. In August 1965 it became the [[12th Combat Aviation Brigade|12th Aviation Group]], which then doubled in size and was used to form the 1st Aviation Brigade in March 1966.<ref name=\"1AVNB\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.1stavnbde.com/|title=Portal - 1st Aviation Brigade - U.S. Army, Vietnam|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401212829/http://www.1stavnbde.com/|archive-date=1 April 2016|access-date=12 May 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Dunstan, in ''Vietnam Choppers'' writes that the numerous independent aviation companies deployed during the war's early years had become difficult to move between sectors because they had developed 'individual means of operating in conjunction with the formations they supported.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dunstan |first1=Simon |title=Vietnam choppers: helicopters in battle 1950-1975 |date=2003 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=0850455723 |page=37}}</ref> Thus the brigade was formed to achieve standardization.\n\nBrigadier General [[George P. Seneff]], the Staff Aviation Officer at [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] (MACV), became the brigade commander. Because the requirements varied in each part of Vietnam, the brigade tried to collocate one assault helicopter company with each U.S. brigade and in course of time each Republic of Korea brigade.<ref name=1AVNB /> The companies supporting [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] units were located in centralized positions to best provide support. The brigade assigned one combat aviation battalion headquarters in direct support of each infantry division and this battalion headquarters normally worked with that division no matter how many companies might be assigned for a specific mission. The Brigade [[Headquarters and headquarters company (United States)|Headquarters and Headquarters Company]] was located in Saigon from May 1966 until August 1967.  Then the HQ moved to [[Long Binh Post|Long Binh]] where it remained until Long Binh was closed in the early autumn of 1972. The HQ then moved to the MACV compound at [[Tan Son Nhut]], where it stayed until withdrawal.\n\nAt this time the 52nd Aviation Battalion supported the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] in the highlands, the 10th Aviation Battalion supported the brigade of the 101st and the Republic of Korea division, the 11th Combat Aviation Battalion supported the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]], the 214th\u2014the 9th Division, and the [[269th Aviation Battalion]]\u2014the 25th Division. The 13th Battalion, which was later to become a full group, remained in the [[Mekong Delta]]. Two aviation groups\u2014the [[17th Aviation Brigade (United States)|17th]] and the 12th\u2014supervised the aviation assets in the [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II]] and [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps Tactical Zone]]s respectively. The aviation group commander was also the aviation officer for the U.S. Field Force commander.\n\nDuring June 1970, the 1st Aviation Brigade reached its largest size, at which point it contained four combat aviation groups, 16 combat aviation battalions, and 83 companies totaling over 4,000 aircraft and 27,000 personnel.<ref group=\"Note\">Constituted 25 April 1966 in the Regular Army as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 222d Aviation Battalion.

He and his younger brother, [[John Fogerty|John]], had separate groups. Tom's band, Spider Webb and the Insects (which featured Jeremy Levine of [[the Seeds]]), signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Del-Fi Records]] but broke up in 1959 before releasing any [[Gramophone record|records]]. [[The Blue Velvets]]&mdash;a group led by John&mdash;began backing Tom. Eventually Tom joined the band, and the group recorded three singles (with Tom on lead vocals) for Orchestra Records in 1961 and 1962. By the mid 1960s, the group had been renamed The Golliwogs and were recording with [[Fantasy Records]], with Tom and John sharing lead vocal duties.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In 1968, the band was again renamed&mdash;this time to [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]&mdash;and John had become full-time lead singer and primary songwriter.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> During the few years of the life of CCR, Tom sang backing vocals and wrote songs, but only one of his songs from when CCR was named [[the Golliwogs]] (\"Walking on the Water\") was re-recorded and chosen to be put on CCR's debut album. This lack of vocal and songwriting opportunity, along with festering, long-standing animosity with his brother, led him to leave the band in early 1971, after finishing the recording of ''[[Pendulum (Creedence Clearwater Revival album)|Pendulum]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nAfter leaving the band, Fogerty began performing and recording as a solo artist.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He had minor hits like \"[[Goodbye Media Man]]\", \"Cast The First Stone\", \"Joyful Resurrection\", and \"B.A.R.T\". He remained with [[Fantasy Records]] and his 1971 solo debut album, ''[[Tom Fogerty (album)|Tom Fogerty]]'', reached #78 on the [[Billboard 200]] chart. On the follow-up, ''[[Excalibur (Tom Fogerty album)|Excalibur]]'', [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Merl Saunders]] played on the sessions.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> [[Stu Cook]] and [[Doug Clifford]] (CCR's former bass guitarist and drummer) as well as John Fogerty performed on the 1974 follow-up album, ''[[Zephyr National]]''. The song \"Joyful Resurrection\" features a complete reunion of CCR though John Fogerty recorded his parts separately. Cook and Clifford also backed Tom on his second LP release of 1974 titled ''[[Myopia (Tom Fogerty album)|Myopia]]''.\n\nThroughout the rest of the 1970s and 1980s, Tom Fogerty continued to record.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He claimed all royalties from the CCR period and sued Fantasy Records. Later, Tom re-signed with Fantasy. At the October 1980 reception for Tom's marriage to Tricia Clapper, all four members of CCR reunited and performed for the first time in a decade. They took the stage once more for a final time at a school reunion three years later. Tom Fogerty lived in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], for the remainder of his life.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n==Death==\nAt some point in the 1980s, Fogerty underwent back surgery, and was given a blood transfusion which was not screened for [[HIV]]. This caused him to become infected with HIV. This led to AIDS, with the ensuing complication of tuberculosis, which led to his death on September 6, 1990.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Tom Fogerty, Guitarist, 48 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/15/obituaries/tom-fogerty-guitarist-48.html |accessdate=8 December 2019 |work=New York Times |agency=Associated Press |date=September 15, 1990|page=29}}</ref> After his death, a music compilation titled ''[[The Very Best of Tom Fogerty]]'' was released.\n\n==Discography==\n{{See also|Creedence Clearwater Revival discography}}\n* ''[[Tom Fogerty (album)|Tom Fogerty]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Excalibur (Tom Fogerty album)|Excalibur]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Zephyr National]]'' (1974)\n* ''[[Myopia (Tom Fogerty album)|Myopia]]'' (1974)\n* ''[[Deal It Out]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[Sidekicks (album)|Sidekicks]]''  <small>(with Randy Oda)</small> (released posthumously in 1992)\n* ''[[The Very Best of Tom Fogerty]]'' (1999)\n\n;with Ruby\n* ''[[Ruby (Ruby album)|Ruby]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[Rock & Roll Madness]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[Precious Gems]]'' (1984)\n\n;Other appearances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Artist\n!Album\n!Comment\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1972\n|[[Merle Saunders]]\n|''[[Fire Up Plus|Heavy Turbulence]]''\n|Guitar and vocals\n|-\n|[[Walter Hawkins]]\n|''Do Your Best''\n|Producer\n|-\n|[[Jim Post]]\n|''Slow To 20''\n|Backing vocals on \"Homemade Music\"\n|-\n|1973\n|rowspan=2|Merle Saunders\n|''[[Fire Up Plus|Fire Up]]''\n|Guitar and producer\n|-\n|1997\n|''Keepers''\n|Previously unreleased recordings\n|}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book|first=Hank|last=Bordowitz|title=Bad Moon Rising: The Unauthorized History of Creedence Clearwater Revival|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1556526619}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Allmusic|id=artist/tom-fogerty-mn0000606814|label=Tom Fogerty}}\n\n{{Tom Fogerty}}\n{{Creedence}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fogerty, Tom}}\n[[Category:1941 births]]\n[[Category:1990 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century American musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century deaths from tuberculosis]]\n[[Category:AIDS-related deaths in Arizona]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:American rock guitarists]]\n[[Category:Creedence Clearwater Revival members]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from California]]\n[[Category:John Fogerty]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Berkeley, California]]\n[[Category:People from Contra Costa County, California]]\n[[Category:Rhythm guitarists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American musician, best known as the rhythm guitarist in Creedence Clearwater Revival}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{Infobox musical artist \n| name            = Tom Fogerty\n| image           = Tom Fogerty.jpg\n| caption         = Tom Fogerty, 1974\n| background      = solo_singer \n| birth_name      = Thomas Richard Fogerty\n| birth_date      = {{birth date|1941|11|09|mf=y}}\n| birth_place     = [[Berkeley, California]], U.S.\n| death_date      = {{death date and age|1990|9|6|1941|11|9}}\n| death_place     = [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], U.S.\n| alias           = Rann Wild{{sfn|Bordowitz|1998|p=28}}\n| genre           = [[Rock music|Rock]], [[roots rock]], {{nowrap|[[country rock]]}}, [[blues rock]], [[swamp pop|swamp rock]], [[Southern rock]], [[rock and roll]]\n| occupation      = Musician, songwriter\n| instrument      = Guitar, vocals\n| associated_acts = [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], [[Ruby (rock band)|Ruby]], [[The Blue Velvets]], [[The Golliwogs]]\n| label           = [[Fantasy Records|Fantasy]], PBR\n| years_active    = 1958\u20131990\n| website         = {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018011505/http://www.geocities.com/julianforjudge/tomfogerty |date=October 18, 2007 |title=Tom Fogerty homepage }}\n}}\n\n'''Thomas Richard Fogerty''' (November 9, 1941 \u2013 September 6, 1990) was an American musician, best known as the rhythm guitarist for [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]].<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=476}}</ref> He was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/creedence-clearwater-revival |title=Creedence Clearwater Revival &#124; Rock & Roll Hall of Fame |website=Rockhall.com |date=1990-09-06 |accessdate=2017-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nTom Fogerty was born in [[Berkeley, California]], United States.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He began singing [[rock and roll]] in high school.

By the mid 1960s, the group had been renamed The Golliwogs and were recording with [[Fantasy Records]], with Tom and John sharing lead vocal duties.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In 1968, the band was again renamed&mdash;this time to [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]&mdash;and John had become full-time lead singer and primary songwriter.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> During the few years of the life of CCR, Tom sang backing vocals and wrote songs, but only one of his songs from when CCR was named [[the Golliwogs]] (\"Walking on the Water\") was re-recorded and chosen to be put on CCR's debut album. This lack of vocal and songwriting opportunity, along with festering, long-standing animosity with his brother, led him to leave the band in early 1971, after finishing the recording of ''[[Pendulum (Creedence Clearwater Revival album)|Pendulum]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nAfter leaving the band, Fogerty began performing and recording as a solo artist.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He had minor hits like \"[[Goodbye Media Man]]\", \"Cast The First Stone\", \"Joyful Resurrection\", and \"B.A.R.T\". He remained with [[Fantasy Records]] and his 1971 solo debut album, ''[[Tom Fogerty (album)|Tom Fogerty]]'', reached #78 on the [[Billboard 200]] chart. On the follow-up, ''[[Excalibur (Tom Fogerty album)|Excalibur]]'', [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Merl Saunders]] played on the sessions.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> [[Stu Cook]] and [[Doug Clifford]] (CCR's former bass guitarist and drummer) as well as John Fogerty performed on the 1974 follow-up album, ''[[Zephyr National]]''. The song \"Joyful Resurrection\" features a complete reunion of CCR though John Fogerty recorded his parts separately. Cook and Clifford also backed Tom on his second LP release of 1974 titled ''[[Myopia (Tom Fogerty album)|Myopia]]''.\n\nThroughout the rest of the 1970s and 1980s, Tom Fogerty continued to record.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He claimed all royalties from the CCR period and sued Fantasy Records. Later, Tom re-signed with Fantasy. At the October 1980 reception for Tom's marriage to Tricia Clapper, all four members of CCR reunited and performed for the first time in a decade. They took the stage once more for a final time at a school reunion three years later. Tom Fogerty lived in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], for the remainder of his life.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n==Death==\nAt some point in the 1980s, Fogerty underwent back surgery, and was given a blood transfusion which was not screened for [[HIV]]. This caused him to become infected with HIV. This led to AIDS, with the ensuing complication of tuberculosis, which led to his death on September 6, 1990.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Tom Fogerty, Guitarist, 48 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/15/obituaries/tom-fogerty-guitarist-48.html |accessdate=8 December 2019 |work=New York Times |agency=Associated Press |date=September 15, 1990|page=29}}</ref> After his death, a music compilation titled ''[[The Very Best of Tom Fogerty]]'' was released.\n\n==Discography==\n{{See also|Creedence Clearwater Revival discography}}\n* ''[[Tom Fogerty (album)|Tom Fogerty]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Excalibur (Tom Fogerty album)|Excalibur]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[Zephyr National]]'' (1974)\n* ''[[Myopia (Tom Fogerty album)|Myopia]]'' (1974)\n* ''[[Deal It Out]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[Sidekicks (album)|Sidekicks]]''  <small>(with Randy Oda)</small> (released posthumously in 1992)\n* ''[[The Very Best of Tom Fogerty]]'' (1999)\n\n;with Ruby\n* ''[[Ruby (Ruby album)|Ruby]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[Rock & Roll Madness]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[Precious Gems]]'' (1984)\n\n;Other appearances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Artist\n!Album\n!Comment\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1972\n|[[Merle Saunders]]\n|''[[Fire Up Plus|Heavy Turbulence]]''\n|Guitar and vocals\n|-\n|[[Walter Hawkins]]\n|''Do Your Best''\n|Producer\n|-\n|[[Jim Post]]\n|''Slow To 20''\n|Backing vocals on \"Homemade Music\"\n|-\n|1973\n|rowspan=2|Merle Saunders\n|''[[Fire Up Plus|Fire Up]]''\n|Guitar and producer\n|-\n|1997\n|''Keepers''\n|Previously unreleased recordings\n|}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book|first=Hank|last=Bordowitz|title=Bad Moon Rising: The Unauthorized History of Creedence Clearwater Revival|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1556526619}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Allmusic|id=artist/tom-fogerty-mn0000606814|label=Tom Fogerty}}\n\n{{Tom Fogerty}}\n{{Creedence}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fogerty, Tom}}\n[[Category:1941 births]]\n[[Category:1990 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century American musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century deaths from tuberculosis]]\n[[Category:AIDS-related deaths in Arizona]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:American rock guitarists]]\n[[Category:Creedence Clearwater Revival members]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from California]]\n[[Category:John Fogerty]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Berkeley, California]]\n[[Category:People from Contra Costa County, California]]\n[[Category:Rhythm guitarists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n", "name_user": "2604:2000:610b:4600:b4c6:2092:789e:4a40", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Fogerty"}

Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

{"title_page": "Tropical desert", "text_new": "[[File:The World Factbook - Algeria - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency (7).jpg|thumb|328x328px|A view of the [[Sahara]]]]\n\n'''Tropical deserts'''  are located in regions between 5 and 30 degrees [[latitude]]. [[Environment (biophysical)|Environment]] is very extreme. They have the highest average monthly [[temperature]] on [[Earth]]. [[Rainfall]] is sporadic; [[precipitation]] may not be observed at all in a few years. In addition to these extreme environmental and climate conditions, most tropical deserts are covered with sand and rocks, and thus too flat and lacking in vegetation to block out the wind. [[Wind]] may erode and transport sand, rocks and other materials; these are known as [[eolian processes]]. Landforms caused by [[wind erosion]] vary greatly in characteristics and size. Representative landforms include [[Depression (geology)|depressions]] and [[pans]], [[Yardangs]], [[inverted topography]] and [[ventifacts]]. No significant [[populations]] can survive in tropical deserts due to extreme aridity, heat and the paucity of vegetation; only specific [[flora]] and [[fauna]] with special behavioral and physical mechanisms are supported. Although tropical deserts are considered to be harsh and barren, they are in fact important sources of [[natural resources]] and plays a significant role in [[economic development]].\n\n== Distribution ==\n\n=== Geographical distribution ===\n[[File:Desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification).svg|thumb|330x330px|Tropical deserts distribution]]\nTropical deserts are located in both continental interiors and coastal areas between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. Representative deserts include the [[Sahara Desert]] in [[North Africa]], the [[Australian Desert]], [[Arabian Desert]] and [[Syrian Desert]] in [[Western Asia]], the [[Kalahari Desert]] in [[Southern Africa]], [[Sonoran Desert]] in the United States and Mexico, [[Mojave Desert]] in the United States, [[Thar Desert]] in India and Pakistan, [[Dasht-e Margo]] and [[Registan Desert]] in Afghanistan and [[Dasht-e Kavir]] and [[Dasht-e Loot]] in Iran.\n\nooooo=== Controlling factor ===\nTropics form a belt around the [[equator]] from latitude 3 degrees north to latitude 3 degrees south, which is called the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]]. Tropical heat generates unstable air in this area, and air masses become extremely dry due to the loss of moisture during the process of tropical ascent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thornthwaite|first=C. W.|date=1948|title=An Approach toward a Rational Classification of Climate|journal=Geographical Review|volume=38|issue=1|pages=55\u201394|doi=10.2307/210739|issn=0016-7428|jstor=210739|bibcode=1948SoilS..66...77T}}</ref>\n\nAnother significant determinant of tropical desert climate is the presence of subtropical high pressure throughout the year; this involves dry and hot descending air cells named [[Hadley cells]]. Specifically, Hadley cells dry out the air and inhibit condensation. Additionally, as the distance from the moisture source increases, the aridity increases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cock|first=Ian|date=2011-10-06|title=Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (EOLSS)|journal=Pharmacognosy Communications|volume=1|issue=2|pages=50\u201352|doi=10.5530/pc.2011.2.10|issn=2249-0159|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n=== Temperature ===\n[[File:Clouds over Kalahari Desert, Namibia.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|279x279px|Spare clouds]]\nTropical deserts have the highest average daily temperature on the planet, as both the energy input during the day and the loss of heat at night are large. This phenomenon causes an extremely large daily temperature range. Specifically, temperatures in a low elevation inland desert can reach 40 to 50\u00b0C during the day, and drop to approximately 5\u00b0C at night; the daily range is around 30 to 40\u00b0C.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|date=2006-01-24|title=Art. 46 Abs. 1 EuGVVO; \u00a7 22 Abs. 2 und 3 AVAG; \u00a7 807 Abs. 1, \u00a7 900 Abs. 1 ZPO|journal=Internationales Handelsrecht|volume=6|issue=3|doi=10.1515/ihr.2006.6.3.121|issn=2193-9527}}</ref>\n\nThere are some other reasons for significant changes in temperature in tropical deserts. For instance, a lack of water and vegetation on the ground can enhance the absorption of the heat due to [[insolation]]. Subsiding air from dominant high pressure areas in a cloud-free sky can also lead to large amounts of insolation; a cloudless sky enables day temperature to escape rapidly at night.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Precipitation ===\nPrecipitation is very irregular in tropical deserts. The average [[annual precipitation]] in low latitude deserts is less than 250 mm. Relative humidity is very low \u2013 only 10% to 30% in interior locations. Some deserts do not have rainfall all year round, because they are located far from the ocean. High-pressure cells and high temperatures can also increase the level of aridity.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Wind ===\nWind greatly contributes to aridity in tropical deserts. If wind speed exceeds 80 km/h, it can generate [[dust storms]] and [[sandstorms]] and erode the rocky surface.<ref>{{Citation|last=Costa|first=Giovanni|chapter=Introduction|date=1995|pages=1\u20133|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642793585|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-79356-1_1|title=Behavioural Adaptations of Desert Animals|series=Adaptations of Desert Organisms}}</ref> Therefore, wind plays an important role in shaping various landforms. This phenomenon is known as the eolian process. There are two types of eolian process: [[deflation]] and [[abrasion (geology)|abrasion]].  \n\nFirst, [[deflation]] may cause the light lowering of ground surface, leading to deflation hollows, [[plains]], [[Depression (geology)|basins]], blowouts, wind-eroded plains and parabolic dunes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Citation|last=Stronge|first=William B.|title=Eolian Processes|date=2005|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Coastal Science|pages=428|editor-last=Schwartz|editor-first=Maurice L.|publisher=Springer Netherlands|doi=10.1007/1-4020-3880-1_137|isbn=9781402019036|last2=Diaz|first2=Henry F.|last3=Bokuniewicz|first3=Henry|last4=Inman|first4=Douglas L.|last5=Jenkins|first5=Scott A.|last6=Hsu|first6=John R. C.|last7=Kennish|first7=Michael J.|last8=Bird|first8=Eric|last9=Hesp|first9=Patrick A.}}</ref> Second, the eolian process leads to [[abrasion (geology)|abrasion]], which forms special landforms with a significant undercut.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Landforms ===\nVarious landforms are found in tropical deserts due to different kinds of eolian process. The major landforms are [[dunes]], [[Depression (geology)|depressions]] and [[pans]], [[yardangs]], and [[inverted topography]].   \n\n==== Dunes ====\n[[File:Dunas del Sahara.jpg|thumb|Dunes|270x270px]]\nThere are various kinds of dune in tropical deserts. Representative dunes include dome dunes, [[transverse dunes]], [[barchans]], star dunes, shadow dunes, linear dunes and longitudinal dunes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Tony|date=1994|title=Book reviews : Cooke, R.U., Warren, A. and Goudie, A.S. 1993: Desert geomorphology.

The factors responsible for pans include a vegetation-free surface and low humidity, a low water table and poorly consolidated sediment, and a huge amount of fine-grained sandstone and shale. Feedback mechanisms also play a significant role in the process of enlarging the pan; salts are left as water accumulates in depressions, which inhibits sedimentation due to weather and the growth of vegetation in the future. This affects both erosional processes and depositional processes in pans.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Gobi Desert- Yadan National Park - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Yardangs|264x264px]]\n\n==== Yardangs ====\n[[Yardangs]] can be observed in orbital and aerial images of [[Mars]] and [[Earth]]. Yardangs usually develop in arid regions, predominantly due to wind processes. The classic forms are streamlined and elongated ridges; they may also appear with flat tops or with stubby and short profiles. Their length-to-width ratios range from 3:1 to 10:1; this is determined by the wind direction, duration of exposure to wind and rock material.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n==== Inverted topography ====\n[[Inverted topography]] forms in areas previously at a low [[elevation]], such as deltaic distributary systems and [[river systems]]. They are left at higher relief due to their relative resistance to wind erosion. Inverted topography is frequently observed in yardang fields, such as raised channels in [[Egypt]], [[Oman]] and [[China]] and on [[Mars]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Biogeography ==\nThe environment in tropical deserts is harsh as well as barren; only certain plants and animals with special behavioral and physical mechanisms can live there.\n\n=== Biological adaption to aridity ===\n[[File:Cactus (11519955525).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|247x247px|Cactus]]\nFor [[flora]], general adaptations including transforming [[leaves]] into [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines]] to protect themselves. With the reduction in leaf area, the stem develops as a major photosynthetic structure, which is also responsible for storing water. A common example is the [[cactus]], which has a specific means of storing and conserving water, along with few or no leaves to minimize transpiration.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://w3.marietta.edu/~biol/tol/tol.html|title=Tree Of Life|website=w3.marietta.edu|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the protection provided by spines, chemical defences are also very common. Desert plants grow slowly as less [[photosynthesis]] takes place, allowing them to invest more in defence.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nAnother adaption is the development of extremely long [[root]]s that allow the flora to acquire moisture at the water table. Furthermore, some desert plants exhibit behavioural adaption; for instance, some flora live for only one season or one year, and desert [[perennials]] can survive by staying dormant during extremely dry periods; when the environment receives more moisture, they become active again.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.desertusa.com/du_plantsurv.html|title=Desert Plant Survival - DesertUSA|website=www.desertusa.com|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>\n\nFor [[fauna]], the easiest way is to stay away from the surface of the tropical deserts as much as possible to avoid the heat and aridity. As a result of the scarcity of water, most animals in these regions get their water from eating [[succulent plants]] and [[seeds]], or from the tissues and blood of their prey.<ref name=\":3\" /> They also have specific ways to store water and prevent water from leaving their bodies. Some animals live in [[burrow]]s under the ground which are not too hot and relatively humid; they stay in their burrows during the heat of the day, and only come out to seek food at night. Examples of these animals include [[kangaroo]] [[rats]] and [[lizards]].<ref name=\":3\" /> Other animals, such as [[wolf spiders]] and [[scorpions]], have a thick outer covering that minimizes moisture loss. Animals in tropical deserts have also been found to concentrate their urine in their [[kidneys]] to excrete less water.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Flora ===\nRepresentative desert plants include the [[barrel cactus]], [[brittlebush]], chain fruit cholla, [[creosote]]. Additionally, it is also common to see crimson hedgehog, [[cactus]], common saltbush and [[desert ironwood]], [[fairy duster]], [[Joshua tree]]. In some deserts Mojave aster, [[ocotillo]], organ pipe cactus and  pancake prickly pear cactus can be found. Furthermore, [[paloverde]], saguaro cactus, [[soaptree yucca]], cholla guera, triangle-leaf bursage, tumbleweed and velvet mesquite can also be found in these regions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://blueplanetbiomes.org/sonorantoad.php|title=Blue Planet Biomes - Sonoran Desert Toad|website=blueplanetbiomes.org|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Fauna ===\nRepresentative fauna in tropical deserts include the [[armadillo lizard]], banded Gila monster, [[bobcat]], [[cactus wren]] and cactus ferruginous pygmy owl. Moreover, some other animals in deserts including [[coyote]], [[desert bighorn sheep]], [[desert kangaroo rat]], [[desert tortoise]], [[javelina]] and Mojave rattlesnake, [[cougar]]. Overall, different tropical deserts have different species, for example, Sonoran Desert toad, Sonoran pronghorn antelope are typical animals in Sonoran Desert.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Natural resources ==\nRich and sometimes unique [[mineral resources]] are located in tropical deserts. Representative minerals include [[borax]], [[sodium nitrate]], [[sodium]], [[iodine]], [[calcium]], [[bromine]], and strontium compounds. These minerals are created when the water in desert lakes evaporates.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://bizfluent.com/list-6834001-resources-do-deserts-.html|title=What Resources Do We Get From Deserts?|last=Dorling|first=S|website=bizfluent.com|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Borax ===\nBorax is a natural cleaner and freshener, also known as a detergent booster. [[Boric acid]] is derived from borax and can be used to manufacture agricultural chemicals such as [[herbicide]] and [[insecticide]], It is also used widely in fire retardants, [[glass]], [[ceramics]], [[water softeners]], [[pharmaceuticals]], [[paint]], [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[cosmetics]] and [[coated paper]]. Billions of dollars of borax has been mined in the northern Mojave Desert since 1881.<ref name=\":5\" />\n[[File:OccidentalOilWellsElkHills.JPG|thumb| [[Elk Hills Oil Field|Oil Field]]|219x219px]]\n\n=== Sodium nitrate ===\nSodium nitrate forms through the evaporation of water in desert areas. The richest cache of [[sodium nitrate]] is located in South America; approximately 3 million metric tons were mined during [[World War I]]. It was the earliest [[food preservative]], and is still used today to cure fish and meat to produce [[bacon]], [[ham]], [[sausage]] and [[deli meats]]. It is also used in the manufacturing of [[pharmaceuticals]], [[fertilizers]], [[dyes]], explosives flares and enamels.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\n=== Fossil fuels ===\n[[Natural gas]] and [[oil]] are complex [[hydrocarbons]] that formed millions of years ago from the decomposition of animals and plants. They are the world\u2019s primary energy source and exist in viscous, solid, liquid or gaseous forms. The five largest oil fields are in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]]. The largest petroleum-producing region in the world is the [[Arabian Desert]].<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\n=== Metallic minerals ===\n[[File:Turquoise.JPG|thumb|Turquoise|217x217px]]\nMost major kinds of mineral deposits formed by groundwater are located in the deserts. For example, some valuable metallic minerals, such as [[gold]], [[silver]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], and [[uranium]], are found in Western Desert in Australia. This is due to special geological processes, and climate factors in the desert can preserve and enhance mineral deposits.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\n=== Gemstones ===\nTropical deserts have various semi-precious and precious gemstones. Some common semi-precious gemstones including [[chalcedony]], [[opal]], [[quartz]], [[turquoise]], [[jade]], [[amethyst]], [[petrified wood]], and [[topaz]]. Precious gemstones such as [[diamonds]] are used in jewellery and decoration. Although some gemstones can also be found in temperate zones throughout the world, [[turquoise]] can only be found in tropical deserts. Turquoise is a very valuable and popular opaque gemstone, with a beautiful blue-green or sky-blue colour and exquisite veins.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Deserts}}\n\n[[Category:Deserts]]\n[[Category:Ecosystems]]\n[[Category:Geomorphology]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:The World Factbook - Algeria - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency (7).jpg|thumb|328x328px|A view of the [[Sahara]]]]\n\n'''Tropical deserts'''  are located in regions between 5 and 30 degrees [[latitude]].

W.|date=1948|title=An Approach toward a Rational Classification of Climate|journal=Geographical Review|volume=38|issue=1|pages=55\u201394|doi=10.2307/210739|issn=0016-7428|jstor=210739|bibcode=1948SoilS..66...77T}}</ref>\n\nAnother significant determinant of tropical desert climate is the presence of subtropical high pressure throughout the year; this involves dry and hot descending air cells named [[Hadley cells]]. Specifically, Hadley cells dry out the air and inhibit condensation. Additionally, as the distance from the moisture source increases, the aridity increases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cock|first=Ian|date=2011-10-06|title=Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (EOLSS)|journal=Pharmacognosy Communications|volume=1|issue=2|pages=50\u201352|doi=10.5530/pc.2011.2.10|issn=2249-0159|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n=== Temperature ===\n[[File:Clouds over Kalahari Desert, Namibia.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|279x279px|Spare clouds]]\nTropical deserts have the highest average daily temperature on the planet, as both the energy input during the day and the loss of heat at night are large. This phenomenon causes an extremely large daily temperature range. Specifically, temperatures in a low elevation inland desert can reach 40 to 50\u00b0C during the day, and drop to approximately 5\u00b0C at night; the daily range is around 30 to 40\u00b0C.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|date=2006-01-24|title=Art. 46 Abs. 1 EuGVVO; \u00a7 22 Abs. 2 und 3 AVAG; \u00a7 807 Abs. 1, \u00a7 900 Abs. 1 ZPO|journal=Internationales Handelsrecht|volume=6|issue=3|doi=10.1515/ihr.2006.6.3.121|issn=2193-9527}}</ref>\n\nThere are some other reasons for significant changes in temperature in tropical deserts. For instance, a lack of water and vegetation on the ground can enhance the absorption of the heat due to [[insolation]]. Subsiding air from dominant high pressure areas in a cloud-free sky can also lead to large amounts of insolation; a cloudless sky enables day temperature to escape rapidly at night.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Precipitation ===\nPrecipitation is very irregular in tropical deserts. The average [[annual precipitation]] in low latitude deserts is less than 250 mm. Relative humidity is very low \u2013 only 10% to 30% in interior locations. Some deserts do not have rainfall all year round, because they are located far from the ocean. High-pressure cells and high temperatures can also increase the level of aridity.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Wind ===\nWind greatly contributes to aridity in tropical deserts. If wind speed exceeds 80 km/h, it can generate [[dust storms]] and [[sandstorms]] and erode the rocky surface.<ref>{{Citation|last=Costa|first=Giovanni|chapter=Introduction|date=1995|pages=1\u20133|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642793585|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-79356-1_1|title=Behavioural Adaptations of Desert Animals|series=Adaptations of Desert Organisms}}</ref> Therefore, wind plays an important role in shaping various landforms. This phenomenon is known as the eolian process. There are two types of eolian process: [[deflation]] and [[abrasion (geology)|abrasion]].  \n\nFirst, [[deflation]] may cause the light lowering of ground surface, leading to deflation hollows, [[plains]], [[Depression (geology)|basins]], blowouts, wind-eroded plains and parabolic dunes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Citation|last=Stronge|first=William B.|title=Eolian Processes|date=2005|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Coastal Science|pages=428|editor-last=Schwartz|editor-first=Maurice L.|publisher=Springer Netherlands|doi=10.1007/1-4020-3880-1_137|isbn=9781402019036|last2=Diaz|first2=Henry F.|last3=Bokuniewicz|first3=Henry|last4=Inman|first4=Douglas L.|last5=Jenkins|first5=Scott A.|last6=Hsu|first6=John R. C.|last7=Kennish|first7=Michael J.|last8=Bird|first8=Eric|last9=Hesp|first9=Patrick A.}}</ref> Second, the eolian process leads to [[abrasion (geology)|abrasion]], which forms special landforms with a significant undercut.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Landforms ===\nVarious landforms are found in tropical deserts due to different kinds of eolian process. The major landforms are [[dunes]], [[Depression (geology)|depressions]] and [[pans]], [[yardangs]], and [[inverted topography]].   \n\n==== Dunes ====\n[[File:Dunas del Sahara.jpg|thumb|Dunes|270x270px]]\nThere are various kinds of dune in tropical deserts. Representative dunes include dome dunes, [[transverse dunes]], [[barchans]], star dunes, shadow dunes, linear dunes and longitudinal dunes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Tony|date=1994|title=Book reviews : Cooke, R.U., Warren, A. and Goudie, A.S. 1993: Desert geomorphology.

The factors responsible for pans include a vegetation-free surface and low humidity, a low water table and poorly consolidated sediment, and a huge amount of fine-grained sandstone and shale. Feedback mechanisms also play a significant role in the process of enlarging the pan; salts are left as water accumulates in depressions, which inhibits sedimentation due to weather and the growth of vegetation in the future. This affects both erosional processes and depositional processes in pans.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Gobi Desert- Yadan National Park - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Yardangs|264x264px]]\n\n==== Yardangs ====\n[[Yardangs]] can be observed in orbital and aerial images of [[Mars]] and [[Earth]]. Yardangs usually develop in arid regions, predominantly due to wind processes. The classic forms are streamlined and elongated ridges; they may also appear with flat tops or with stubby and short profiles. Their length-to-width ratios range from 3:1 to 10:1; this is determined by the wind direction, duration of exposure to wind and rock material.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n==== Inverted topography ====\n[[Inverted topography]] forms in areas previously at a low [[elevation]], such as deltaic distributary systems and [[river systems]]. They are left at higher relief due to their relative resistance to wind erosion. Inverted topography is frequently observed in yardang fields, such as raised channels in [[Egypt]], [[Oman]] and [[China]] and on [[Mars]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Biogeography ==\nThe environment in tropical deserts is harsh as well as barren; only certain plants and animals with special behavioral and physical mechanisms can live there.\n\n=== Biological adaption to aridity ===\n[[File:Cactus (11519955525).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|247x247px|Cactus]]\nFor [[flora]], general adaptations including transforming [[leaves]] into [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines]] to protect themselves. With the reduction in leaf area, the stem develops as a major photosynthetic structure, which is also responsible for storing water. A common example is the [[cactus]], which has a specific means of storing and conserving water, along with few or no leaves to minimize transpiration.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://w3.marietta.edu/~biol/tol/tol.html|title=Tree Of Life|website=w3.marietta.edu|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the protection provided by spines, chemical defences are also very common. Desert plants grow slowly as less [[photosynthesis]] takes place, allowing them to invest more in defence.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nAnother adaption is the development of extremely long [[root]]s that allow the flora to acquire moisture at the water table. Furthermore, some desert plants exhibit behavioural adaption; for instance, some flora live for only one season or one year, and desert [[perennials]] can survive by staying dormant during extremely dry periods; when the environment receives more moisture, they become active again.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.desertusa.com/du_plantsurv.html|title=Desert Plant Survival - DesertUSA|website=www.desertusa.com|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>\n\nFor [[fauna]], the easiest way is to stay away from the surface of the tropical deserts as much as possible to avoid the heat and aridity. As a result of the scarcity of water, most animals in these regions get their water from eating [[succulent plants]] and [[seeds]], or from the tissues and blood of their prey.<ref name=\":3\" /> They also have specific ways to store water and prevent water from leaving their bodies. Some animals live in [[burrow]]s under the ground which are not too hot and relatively humid; they stay in their burrows during the heat of the day, and only come out to seek food at night. Examples of these animals include [[kangaroo]] [[rats]] and [[lizards]].<ref name=\":3\" /> Other animals, such as [[wolf spiders]] and [[scorpions]], have a thick outer covering that minimizes moisture loss. Animals in tropical deserts have also been found to concentrate their urine in their [[kidneys]] to excrete less water.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Flora ===\nRepresentative desert plants include the [[barrel cactus]], [[brittlebush]], chain fruit cholla, [[creosote]]. Additionally, it is also common to see crimson hedgehog, [[cactus]], common saltbush and [[desert ironwood]], [[fairy duster]], [[Joshua tree]]. In some deserts Mojave aster, [[ocotillo]], organ pipe cactus and  pancake prickly pear cactus can be found. Furthermore, [[paloverde]], saguaro cactus, [[soaptree yucca]], cholla guera, triangle-leaf bursage, tumbleweed and velvet mesquite can also be found in these regions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://blueplanetbiomes.org/sonorantoad.php|title=Blue Planet Biomes - Sonoran Desert Toad|website=blueplanetbiomes.org|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Fauna ===\nRepresentative fauna in tropical deserts include the [[armadillo lizard]], banded Gila monster, [[bobcat]], [[cactus wren]] and cactus ferruginous pygmy owl. Moreover, some other animals in deserts including [[coyote]], [[desert bighorn sheep]], [[desert kangaroo rat]], [[desert tortoise]], [[javelina]] and Mojave rattlesnake, [[cougar]]. Overall, different tropical deserts have different species, for example, Sonoran Desert toad, Sonoran pronghorn antelope are typical animals in Sonoran Desert.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Natural resources ==\nRich and sometimes unique [[mineral resources]] are located in tropical deserts. Representative minerals include [[borax]], [[sodium nitrate]], [[sodium]], [[iodine]], [[calcium]], [[bromine]], and strontium compounds. These minerals are created when the water in desert lakes evaporates.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://bizfluent.com/list-6834001-resources-do-deserts-.html|title=What Resources Do We Get From Deserts?|last=Dorling|first=S|website=bizfluent.com|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Borax ===\nBorax is a natural cleaner and freshener, also known as a detergent booster. [[Boric acid]] is derived from borax and can be used to manufacture agricultural chemicals such as [[herbicide]] and [[insecticide]], It is also used widely in fire retardants, [[glass]], [[ceramics]], [[water softeners]], [[pharmaceuticals]], [[paint]], [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[cosmetics]] and [[coated paper]]. Billions of dollars of borax has been mined in the northern Mojave Desert since 1881.<ref name=\":5\" />\n[[File:OccidentalOilWellsElkHills.JPG|thumb| [[Elk Hills Oil Field|Oil Field]]|219x219px]]\n\n=== Sodium nitrate ===\nSodium nitrate forms through the evaporation of water in desert areas. The richest cache of [[sodium nitrate]] is located in South America; approximately 3 million metric tons were mined during [[World War I]]. It was the earliest [[food preservative]], and is still used today to cure fish and meat to produce [[bacon]], [[ham]], [[sausage]] and [[deli meats]]. It is also used in the manufacturing of [[pharmaceuticals]], [[fertilizers]], [[dyes]], explosives flares and enamels.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\n=== Fossil fuels ===\n[[Natural gas]] and [[oil]] are complex [[hydrocarbons]] that formed millions of years ago from the decomposition of animals and plants. They are the world\u2019s primary energy source and exist in viscous, solid, liquid or gaseous forms. The five largest oil fields are in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]]. The largest petroleum-producing region in the world is the [[Arabian Desert]].<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\n=== Metallic minerals ===\n[[File:Turquoise.JPG|thumb|Turquoise|217x217px]]\nMost major kinds of mineral deposits formed by groundwater are located in the deserts. For example, some valuable metallic minerals, such as [[gold]], [[silver]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], and [[uranium]], are found in Western Desert in Australia. This is due to special geological processes, and climate factors in the desert can preserve and enhance mineral deposits.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\n=== Gemstones ===\nTropical deserts have various semi-precious and precious gemstones. Some common semi-precious gemstones including [[chalcedony]], [[opal]], [[quartz]], [[turquoise]], [[jade]], [[amethyst]], [[petrified wood]], and [[topaz]]. Precious gemstones such as [[diamonds]] are used in jewellery and decoration. Although some gemstones can also be found in temperate zones throughout the world, [[turquoise]] can only be found in tropical deserts. Turquoise is a very valuable and popular opaque gemstone, with a beautiful blue-green or sky-blue colour and exquisite veins.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Deserts}}\n\n[[Category:Deserts]]\n[[Category:Ecosystems]]\n[[Category:Geomorphology]]\n", "name_user": "2405:201:800:efe9:e508:1050:70b2:bff9", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_desert"}
