Neith quickly finds that Hunter's memories are a seemingly impossible maze of other lives/narratives.

In another, Neith sees the [[5th century]] [[Alchemy|alchemist]] lover of [[Augustine of Hippo]], Athenais Karthagonensis, as she endeavors to uncover the secrets of a chamber that could lead to the fabled [[Alcahest]] following the death of her son. In yet another, Neith sees [[Ethiopia|Ethiopian]] painter Berihun Bekele, who lives in [[London]] in the early 21st century and assists his granddaughter Annie with the development of a [[video game]], ''Witnessed,'' that bears striking resemblance to Neith's actual world.\n\n==Reception==\nIn [[The Independent|''The Independent'']], Darragh McManus gave a negative review,<ref>{{cite web |last1=McManus |first1=Darragh |title=Baffling utopian epic ladled with elegant nonsense |url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/book-reviews/baffling-utopian-epic-ladled-with-elegant-nonsense-36305841.html |website=The Independent |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> calling the book a \"baffling utopian epic ladled with elegant nonsense.\" While praising Harkaway for \"writing women extremely well\" (\"Hunter, Neith and Athenais are the book's most vivid creations and strongest elements\"), and saying \"there are a lot of things to enjoy in ''Gnomon'',\" she nevertheless felt it was \"hugely confusing.\"\n\n<blockquote>It's not the length, though the novel is much too long. It's not that Harkaway has a tendency to overwrite: both in labouring a point or observation before labouring it some more, and using arcane (and possibly non-existent) words where a normal, widely-known one was available. [...] My main problem is that ''Gnomon'' doesn't make a lick of sense. Or maybe it does, in the author's mind, but I'm afraid I was baffled, to the point of paralysed stupidity. I genuinely couldn't tell you, by the end, who did what and when, whether anything reported here actually occurred, whether any or all of these characters even exist.</blockquote>\n\nIn [[The Guardian|''The Guardian'']], Steven Poole also gave the book a relatively negative review.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Poole |first1=Steven |title=Gnomon by Nick Harkaway review \u2013 a future of total surveillance |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/16/gnomon-nick-harkaway-review-science-fiction-artifical-intelligence |website=The Guardian |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> \"''Gnomon'' [...] reads like the first draft of what might have been a tighter 400-page book rather than a rambling 700-pager. Progress is routinely halted by sketchy Wikipedia-style [[Infodump|exposition-dumps]] about tidal flow or [[behavioural economics]], or a character asking herself a whole page or two of questions about what just happened, or vague disquisitions on the meaning of identity. Things are repeatedly explained, unnecessarily.\" Still, Poole also said, \"Such defects wouldn\u2019t be so annoying were it not obvious that Nick Harkaway can sometimes be a very good writer indeed. Readers who are prepared to mentally edit the book as they go along, as the author and editor have not, will encounter a host of highly enjoyable fragments and suggestive ideas.\"\n\nFor [[NPR]], Jason Sheehan gave a mixed review,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sheehan |first1=Jason |title='Gnomon' Starts Simply \u2014 And Then It Goes Sideways |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/07/573582683/gnomon-starts-simply-and-then-it-goes-sideways |website=NPR |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> saying, \"it's a big book, a digressive book, and it contains so much that it sometimes feels (like Diana Hunter's house is supposed to feel) like a museum of curiosities trapped between two covers and shaken vigorously. You can't help but be hooked by a detail here, a tic of recursive language there, until suddenly, you know things about [[Isis]], ocean water or the [[Thames]] that you never thought would be interesting until Harkaway dangled them in front of you.\"\n\nFor [[Tor.com]], Niall Alexander gave a very positive review.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alexander |first1=Niall |title=Conceptual Mass: Gnomon by Nick Harkaway |url=https://www.tor.com/2018/01/12/book-reviews-gnomon-by-nick-harkaway/ |website=Tor.com |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> \"its vast canvas takes in tales of inexplicable ancient history, our appallingly prescient present and, fittingly, the far flung future, all of which orbit ''Gnomon\u2019s'' central Orwellian thread like spy satellites on an imminent collision course.\" Alexander called the twisting narrative \"a puzzle that proves a pleasure to pursue,\" complaining only that \"when answers are handed to us on pretty little platters, it cheapens an experience so rich as to be remarkable in every remaining respect.\" Alexander concluded,\n\n<blockquote>In its cautionary characters and in its careful construction, in its incredible creativity and in its conversely very credible commentary, Harkaway\u2019s latest is likely his greatest. As in ''[[The Gone-Away World]]'' and ''Angelmaker'' before it, the macro is simply magnificent\u2014''Gnomon'' bursts at the seams with appealing ideas, powerfully put, and perhaps more relevant than ever\u2014but bolstered as it is by the micro that made ''Tigerman'' so moving at the same time as being buttressed by the author\u2019s inquiries into the meaning of life in the digital era in ''The Blind Giant'', this isn\u2019t just a big, brash book about technology or [[horology]], it\u2019s a breathtakingly bold, barely-tamed beast of a read about being human in an increasingly alien age.</blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33852053-gnomon ''Gnomon'' on Goodreads]\n\n[[Category:2017 novels]]\n[[Category:British novels]]\n[[Category:Science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:English-language novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in the United Kingdom]]\n{{sf-novel-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox book\n| name          = ''Gnomon''\n| title_orig    = \n| translator    = \n| image         = \n| image_caption = \n| author        = Nick Harkaway\n| illustrator   = \n| cover_artist  = \n| country       = [[United Kingdom]]\n| language      = English\n| series        = \n| subject       = <!-- Subject is not relevant for fiction -->\n| genre         = [[Science fiction]]\n| published     = 2017\n| media_type    = Print\n| pages         = 704\n| isbn          = 978-1-473-53954-9\n| oclc          = \n| preceded_by   = \n| followed_by   = \n| wikisource    = \n}}\n'''''Gnomon''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by [[Nick Harkaway]].

It's not that Harkaway has a tendency to overwrite: both in labouring a point or observation before labouring it some more, and using arcane (and possibly non-existent) words where a normal, widely-known one was available. [...] My main problem is that ''Gnomon'' doesn't make a lick of sense. Or maybe it does, in the author's mind, but I'm afraid I was baffled, to the point of paralysed stupidity. I genuinely couldn't tell you, by the end, who did what and when, whether anything reported here actually occurred, whether any or all of these characters even exist.</blockquote>\n\nIn [[The Guardian|''The Guardian'']], Steven Poole also gave the book a relatively negative review.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Poole |first1=Steven |title=Gnomon by Nick Harkaway review \u2013 a future of total surveillance |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/16/gnomon-nick-harkaway-review-science-fiction-artifical-intelligence |website=The Guardian |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> \"''Gnomon'' [...] reads like the first draft of what might have been a tighter 400-page book rather than a rambling 700-pager. Progress is routinely halted by sketchy Wikipedia-style [[Infodump|exposition-dumps]] about tidal flow or [[behavioural economics]], or a character asking herself a whole page or two of questions about what just happened, or vague disquisitions on the meaning of identity. Things are repeatedly explained, unnecessarily.\" Still, Poole also said, \"Such defects wouldn\u2019t be so annoying were it not obvious that Nick Harkaway can sometimes be a very good writer indeed. Readers who are prepared to mentally edit the book as they go along, as the author and editor have not, will encounter a host of highly enjoyable fragments and suggestive ideas.\"\n\nFor [[NPR]], Jason Sheehan gave a mixed review,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sheehan |first1=Jason |title='Gnomon' Starts Simply \u2014 And Then It Goes Sideways |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/07/573582683/gnomon-starts-simply-and-then-it-goes-sideways |website=NPR |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> saying, \"it's a big book, a digressive book, and it contains so much that it sometimes feels (like Diana Hunter's house is supposed to feel) like a museum of curiosities trapped between two covers and shaken vigorously.

As in ''[[The Gone-Away World]]'' and ''Angelmaker'' before it, the macro is simply magnificent\u2014''Gnomon'' bursts at the seams with appealing ideas, powerfully put, and perhaps more relevant than ever\u2014but bolstered as it is by the micro that made ''Tigerman'' so moving at the same time as being buttressed by the author\u2019s inquiries into the meaning of life in the digital era in ''The Blind Giant'', this isn\u2019t just a big, brash book about technology or [[horology]], it\u2019s a breathtakingly bold, barely-tamed beast of a read about being human in an increasingly alien age.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33852053-gnomon ''Gnomon'' on Goodreads]\n\n[[Category:2017 novels]]\n[[Category:British novels]]\n[[Category:Science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:English-language novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in the United Kingdom]]\n{{sf-novel-stub}}\n", "name_user": "RobertM525", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReception", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon_(novel)"}

Dukes recalled: \"We last spoke in August and he informed me he wasn\u2019t going to Washington after all. I told him I was heartbroken to hear that. Aside from being heartbroken, I am puzzled.

Behold, mine house is a house of order, saith the Lord God, and not a house of confusion. Will I accept of an offering, saith the Lord, that is not made in my name? Or will I receive at your hands that which I have not appointed? And will I appoint unto you, saith the Lord, except it be by law, even as I and my Father ordained unto you, before the world was? I am the Lord thy God; and I give unto you this commandment\u2014that no man shall come unto the Father but by me or by my word, which is my law, saith the Lord. And everything that is in the world, whether it be ordained of men, by thrones, or principalities, or powers, or things of name, whatsoever they may be, that are not by me or by my word, saith the Lord, shall be thrown down, and shall not remain after men are dead, neither in nor after the resurrection, saith the Lord your God. For whatsoever things remain are by me; and whatsoever things are not by me shall be shaken and destroyed. Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world. Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory. For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity; and from henceforth are not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever. And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife, and make a covenant with her for time and for all eternity, if that covenant is not by me or by my word, which is my law, and is not sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, through him whom I have anointed and appointed unto this power, then it is not valid neither of force when they are out of the world, because they are not joined by me, saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are out of the world it cannot be received there, because the angels and the gods are appointed there, by whom they cannot pass; they cannot, therefore, inherit my glory; for my house is a house of order, saith the Lord God. And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power and the keys of this priesthood; and it shall be said unto them\u2014Ye shall come forth in the first resurrection; and if it be after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection; and shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths\u2014then shall it be written in the Lamb\u2019s Book of Life, that he shall commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, and if ye abide in my covenant, and commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity; and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.}}\n\n[[Boyd K. Packer]] has also elaborated on the meaning of the term \"seal\" in conjunction with the phrase \"sealing power\":{{cquote|For many centuries it has been the practice all over the world to use an official seal to certify that a document or a proceeding is indeed authoritative. The word seal, used in that context, becomes synonymous for endorse or confirm, to license, to favor, to ratify, to accredit, to authorize, to advocate, and to bind. Everywhere in the world this system is used. Governments have their official seal, sometimes called the great seal. It was common in earlier eras in the courts of kings. In those courts it was a position of the greatest responsibility and honor to be designated as the keeper or the clerk of the great seal. To have custody of the seal was an office of unequalled trust. We see the use of seals everywhere. When a signature is notarized, an impression is made upon the paper with a seal. When a license is obtained from a municipality or a state, from a federation or an association, somewhere upon it is impressed the official seal of the organization. You find it on the diploma issued by universities, on legal documents that process through the courts, and on many other papers. The use of a seal is a visible means of signifying that the document is authoritative, that it is worthy of respect and recognition, that its effect is binding. Seal is the right word, therefore, to be used to represent spiritual authority. In this case it is not represented by an imprint, by a wax impression, by an embossment, or by a ribbon; nor by an engravement on a signet, or by a stamp, or by a gold design pressed onto a document. The seal of official authority relating to spiritual matters, like other things spiritual, can be identified by the influence that is felt when the sealing power is exercised. The sealing power represents the transcendent delegation of spiritual authority from God to man. The keeper of that sealing power is the Lord's chief representative here upon the earth. That is the position of consummate trust and authority.<br>''[[The Holy Temple]], Boyd K. Packer, pp. 81-82''}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mormon]]\n* [[Mormonism]]\n* [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)]]\n* [[Second anointing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sealing Power}}\n[[Category:Latter Day Saint concepts of the afterlife]]\n[[Category:Latter Day Saint ordinances, rituals, and symbolism]]\n[[Category:Latter Day Saint temple practices]]\n[[Category:Latter Day Saint terms]]\n[[Category:1836 establishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:1836 in Christianity]]\n", "text_old": "In [[Mormonism]], the '''sealing power''' is the means whereby all \"covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations, or expectations\" attain \"efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead.\" (D&C 132:7.)

And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power and the keys of this priesthood; and it shall be said unto them\u2014Ye shall come forth in the first resurrection; and if it be after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection; and shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths\u2014then shall it be written in the Lamb\u2019s Book of Life, that he shall commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, and if ye abide in my covenant, and commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity; and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.}}\n\n[[Boyd K. Packer]] has also elaborated on the meaning of the term \"seal\" in conjunction with the phrase \"sealing power\":{{cquote|For many centuries it has been the practice all over the world to use an official seal to certify that a document or a proceeding is indeed authoritative. The word seal, used in that context, becomes synonymous for endorse or confirm, to license, to favor, to ratify, to accredit, to authorize, to advocate, and to bind. Everywhere in the world this system is used. Governments have their official seal, sometimes called the great seal. It was common in earlier eras in the courts of kings. In those courts it was a position of the greatest responsibility and honor to be designated as the keeper or the clerk of the great seal. To have custody of the seal was an office of unequalled trust. We see the use of seals everywhere. When a signature is notarized, an impression is made upon the paper with a seal. When a license is obtained from a municipality or a state, from a federation or an association, somewhere upon it is impressed the official seal of the organization. You find it on the diploma issued by universities, on legal documents that process through the courts, and on many other papers. The use of a seal is a visible means of signifying that the document is authoritative, that it is worthy of respect and recognition, that its effect is binding. Seal is the right word, therefore, to be used to represent spiritual authority. In this case it is not represented by an imprint, by a wax impression, by an embossment, or by a ribbon; nor by an engravement on a signet, or by a stamp, or by a gold design pressed onto a document. The seal of official authority relating to spiritual matters, like other things spiritual, can be identified by the influence that is felt when the sealing power is exercised. The sealing power represents the transcendent delegation of spiritual authority from God to man. The keeper of that sealing power is the Lord's chief representative here upon the earth. That is the position of consummate trust and authority.<br>''[[The Holy Temple]], Boyd K.
