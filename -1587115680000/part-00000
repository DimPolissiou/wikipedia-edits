In that period [[Cicero]], along with others, noted that the language he used every day, presumably the upper-class city Latin, included lexical items and phrases that were heirlooms from a previous time, which he called ''verborum vetustas prisca'',<ref>''De Oratoribus'', I.193.</ref> translated as \"the old age/time of language\".\n\nDuring the classical period, ''Prisca Latinitas'', ''Prisca Latina'' and other [[idiom]]s using the adjective always meant these remnants of a previous language, which, in the Roman philology, was taken to be much older in fact than it really was. ''Viri prisci'', \"old-time men\", were the population of [[Latium]] before the [[founding of Rome]].\n\n=== The four Latins of Isidore ===\nIn the [[Late Latin]] period, when Classical Latin was behind them, the Latin- and Greek-speaking grammarians were faced with multiple phases, or styles, within the language. [[Isidore of Seville]] reports a classification scheme that had come into existence in or before his time: \"the four Latins\" (\"Moreover, some people have said that there are four Latin languages\"; ''\"Latinas autem linguas quattuor esse quidam dixerunt\"'').<ref>Book IX.1.6.</ref> They were ''Prisca'', spoken before the founding of Rome, when [[Janus]] and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] ruled [[Latium]], to which he dated the ''[[Carmen Saliare]]''; ''Latina'', dated from the time of king [[Latinus]], in which period he placed the laws of the [[Twelve Tables]]; ''Romana'', essentially equal to Classical Latin; and ''Mixta'', \"mixed\" Classical Latin and [[Vulgar Latin]], which is known today as [[Late Latin]]. The scheme persisted with little change for some thousand years after Isidore.\n\n=== Old Latin ===\nIn 1874, [[John Wordsworth]] used this definition: \"By Early Latin I understand Latin of the whole period of the Republic, which is separated very strikingly, both in tone and in outward form, from that of the Empire.\"{{sfn|Wordsworth|1874|p=v}}\n\nAlthough the differences are striking and can be easily identified by Latin readers, they are not such as to cause a language barrier. Latin speakers of the empire had no reported trouble understanding Old Latin, except for the few texts that must date from the time of the [[King of Rome|kings]], mainly songs. Thus, the laws of the [[Twelve Tables]] from the early Republic were comprehensible, but the ''[[Carmen Saliare]]'', probably written under [[Numa Pompilius]], was not entirely clear (and remains thus).\n\nAn opinion concerning Old Latin, of a Roman man of letters in the middle Republic, survives: the historian, [[Polybius]],<ref>''Histories'' III.22.</ref> read \"the first treaty between Rome and Carthage\", which he says \"dates from the consulship of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] and Marcus Horatius, the first consuls after the expulsion of the kings\". Knowledge of the early consuls is somewhat obscure, but Polybius also states that the treaty was formulated 28 years before [[Xerxes I]] crossed into Greece; that is, in 508  BC, about the time of the putative date of the founding of the Roman Republic. Polybius says of the language of the treaty \"the ancient Roman language differs so much from the modern that it can only be partially made out, and that after much application by the most intelligent men\".\n\nThere is no sharp distinction between Old Latin, as it was spoken for most of the Republic, and Classical Latin, but the earlier grades into the later. The end of the republic was too late a termination for compilers after Wordsworth; [[Charles Edwin Bennett]] said, \"'Early Latin' is necessarily a somewhat vague term ... Bell, ''De locativi in prisca Latinitate vi et usu'', Breslau, 1889,<ref>{{cite book|title=De Locativi in prisca latinitate vi et usu, dissertatio inauguralis philologica|first=Andreas|last=Bell|publisher=typis Grassi, Barthi et soc (W. Friedrich)|location=Breslau|year=1889}}</ref> sets the later limit at 75 BC. A definite date is really impossible, since archaic Latin does not terminate abruptly, but continues even down to imperial times.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1910|iii}} Bennett's own date of 100 BC did not prevail but rather Bell's 75 BC became the standard as expressed in the four-volume Loeb Library and other major compendia. Over the 377 years from 452 to 75 BC, Old Latin evolved from being partially comprehensible by classicists with study to being easily read by scholars.\n\n== Corpus ==\n[[File:Praeneste fibula.JPG|thumb|300px|The Praeneste Fibula, the earliest known specimen of the [[Latin]] language and dated to the first half of the seventh century BC.]]\n[[Image:Forum inscription.jpg|thumb|200px|The Forum inscription (''[[Lapis Niger]]'', \"black stone\"), one of the oldest known Latin inscriptions, from the 6th century BC; it is written [[boustrophedon]], albeit irregularly; from a rubbing by [[Domenico Comparetti]].]]\n\nOld Latin authored works began in the 3rd century BC. These are complete or nearly complete works under their own name surviving as manuscripts copied from other manuscripts in whatever script was current at the time. In addition are fragments of works quoted in other authors.\n\nNumerous inscriptions placed by various methods (painting, engraving, embossing) on their original media survive just as they were except for the ravages of time. Some of these were copied from other inscriptions. No inscription can be earlier than the introduction of the Greek alphabet into Italy but none survive from that early date. The imprecision of archaeological dating makes it impossible to assign a year to any one inscription, but the earliest survivals are probably from the 6th century BC. Some texts, however, that survive as fragments in the works of classical authors, had to have been composed earlier than the republic, in the time of the [[Roman Kingdom|monarchy]].

The writing conventions varied by time and place until classical conventions prevailed. The works of authors in manuscript form were copied over into the scripts current in those later times. The original writing does not survive.\n\n== Orthography ==\nSome differences between old and classical Latin were of spelling only; pronunciation is thought to be essentially the same as in classical Latin:<ref>{{cite book|year=1897|last=De Forest Allen|page=8|quote=There were no such names as ''Caius'', ''Cnaius''}}</ref>\n* Single for double consonants: ''Marcelus'' for ''Marcellus''\n* Double vowels for long vowels: ''aara'' for ''\u0101ra''\n* q for c before u: ''pequnia'' for ''pecunia''\n* c for g: ''Caius'' for ''Gaius''\n\nThese differences did not necessarily run concurrently with each other and were not universal; that is, c was used for both c and g.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{See also|History of Latin}}\n[[Image:Old latin diphthongs nochar.svg|200px|thumb|Diphthong changes from Old Latin (left) to Classical Latin (right)<ref>Allen (1897), p.6</ref>]]\n\n=== Stress ===\nOld Latin is thought to have had a strong stress on the first syllable of a word until about 250 BC. All syllables other than the first were unstressed and were subjected to greater amounts of phonological weakening. Starting around that year, the Classical Latin stress system began to develop. It passed through at least one intermediate stage, found in [[Plautus]], in which the stress occurred on the fourth last syllable in four-syllable words with all short syllables.\n\n=== Vowels and diphthongs ===\nMost original PIE ([[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]) diphthongs were preserved in stressed syllables, including {{IPA|/ai/}} (later ''ae''); {{IPA|/ei/}} (later ''\u012b''); {{IPA|/oi/}} (later ''\u016b'', or sometimes ''oe''); {{IPA|/ou/}} (from PIE {{IPA|/eu/}} and {{IPA|/ou/}}; later ''\u016b'').\n\nThe Old Latin diphthong ''ei'' evolves in stages: ''ei'' > ''\u1eb9\u0304'' > ''\u012b''. The intermediate sound ''\u1eb9\u0304'' was simply written ''e'' but must have been distinct from the normal long vowel ''\u0113'' because ''\u1eb9\u0304'' subsequently merged with ''\u012b'' while ''\u0113'' did not. It is generally thought that ''\u1eb9\u0304'' was a higher sound than ''e'' (e.g. perhaps {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} vs. {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}} during the time when both sounds existed). Even after the original vowel {{IPA|/ei/}} had merged with ''\u012b'', the old spelling ''ei'' continued to be used for a while, with the result that ''ei'' came to stand for ''\u012b'' and began to be used in the spelling of original occurrences of ''\u012b'' that did not evolve from ''ei'' (e.g. in the genitive singular ''-\u012b'', which is always spelled ''-i'' in the oldest inscriptions but later on can be spelled either ''-i'' or ''-ei'').\n\nIn unstressed syllables, *oi and *ai had already merged into ''ei'' by historic times (except for one possible occurrence of ''poploe'' for ''popul\u012b'' \"people\" in a late manuscript of one of the early songs). This eventually evolved to ''\u012b'' according to the process described above.\n\nOld Latin often had different short vowels from Classical Latin, reflecting sound changes that had not yet taken place. For example, the very early [[Duenos inscription]] has the form ''duenos'' \"good\", later found as ''duonos'' and still later ''bonus''. A countervailing change ''wo'' > ''we'' occurred around 150 BC in certain contexts, and many earlier forms are found (e.g. earlier ''vot\u014d, voster, vorsus'' vs. later ''vet\u014d, vester, versus'').\n\nOld Latin frequently preserves original PIE thematic case endings ''[[Old Latin#Second declension .28b.29|-os]]'' and ''[[Old Latin#Second declension .28b.29|-om]]'' (later ''-us'' and ''-um'').\n\n===Consonants===\nIntervocalic {{IPA|/s/}} (pronounced {{IPA|[z]}}) was preserved up through 350 BC or so, at which point it changed into {{IPA|/r/}} (called [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]). This rhotacism had implications for declension: early classical Latin, ''honos'', ''honoris'' (from ''honos'', ''honoses''); later Classical (by [[Morphological leveling|analogy]]) ''honor'', ''honoris'' (\"honor\"). Some Old Latin texts preserve {{IPA|/s/}} in this position, such as the [[Carmen Arvale]]'s ''lases'' for ''[[lares]]''.  Later instances of single {{IPA|/s/}} between vowels are mostly due either to reduction of early {{IPA|/ss/}} after long vowels or diphthongs; borrowings; or late reconstructions.\n\nThere are many unreduced clusters, e.g. ''iouxmentom'' (later ''i\u016bmentum'', \"beast of burden\"); ''losna'' (later ''l\u016bna'', \"moon\") < *''lousna'' < */leuksn\u0101/; ''cosmis'' (later ''c\u014dmis'', \"courteous\"); ''stlocum'', acc. (later ''locum'', \"place\").\n\nEarly ''du'' {{IPA|/dw/}} becomes later ''b'': ''duenos'' > ''duonos'' > ''bonus'' \"good\"; ''duis'' > ''bis'' \"twice\"; ''duellom'' > ''bellum'' \"war\".\n\nFinal {{IPA|/d/}} occurred in ablatives, such as ''puell\u0101d'' \"from the girl\" or ''camp\u014dd'' \"from the field\", later ''puell\u0101'' and ''camp\u014d''. In verb conjugation, the third-person ending -''d'' later became -''t'', e.g. Old Latin ''faced'' > Classical ''facit.''\n\n==Morphology==\n===Nouns===\nLatin [[noun]]s are distinguished by [[grammatical case]], with a termination, or suffix, determining its use in the sentence: subject, predicate, etc. A case for a given word is formed by suffixing a case ending to a part of the word common to all its cases called a [[Word stem|stem]]. Stems are classified by their last letters as vowel or consonant. Vowel stems are formed by adding a suffix to a shorter and more ancient segment called a [[Root (linguistics)|root]]. Consonant stems are the root (roots end in consonants). The combination of the last letter of the stem and the case ending often results in an ending also called a case ending or termination. For example, the stem ''puella-'' receives a case ending ''-m'' to form the accusative case ''puellam'' in which the termination ''-am'' is evident.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Latin grammar|first=Charles Edwin |last=Bennett|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston, Chicago|year=1915|origyear=1895, 1908|page=12}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Classical Latin]] textbooks the declensions are named from the letter ending the stem or First, Second, etc. to Fifth. A declension may be illustrated by a [[paradigm]], or listing of all the cases of a typical word. This method is less frequently applied to Old Latin, and with less validity. In contrast to Classical Latin, Old Latin reflects the evolution of the language from an unknown hypothetical ancestor spoken in [[Latium]]. The endings are multiple. Their use depends on time and locality. Any paradigm selected would be subject to these constraints and if applied to the language universally would result in false constructs, hypothetical words not attested in the Old Latin corpus. Nevertheless, the endings are illustrated below by quasi-classical paradigms. Alternative endings from different stages of development are given, but they may not be attested for the word of the paradigm. For example, in the second declension, *''campoe'' \"fields\" is unattested, but ''poploe'' \"peoples\" is attested.\n\nThe locative was a separate case in Old Latin but gradually became reduced in function, and the locative singular form eventually merged with the genitive singular by regular sound change. In the plural, the locative was captured by the ablative case in all Italic languages before Old Latin.<ref>{{cite book|page=204|title=A Grammar Of Oscan And Umbrian: With A Collection Of Inscriptions And A Glossary|first=Carl Darling|last=Buck|series=Languages of classical antiquity, vol. 5|location=Bristol, Pa.|publisher=Evolution Publishing|year=2005|origyear=1904}}</ref>\n\n====First declension (a)====\nThe 'A-stem' declension.

Sihler (1995)<ref name=\"sihler\"/> notes that this form appears in literature only in pronouns and suggests that inscriptional examples added to nouns may be artificial (i.e. not reflecting actual pronunciation).\n*In the vocative singular, some nouns lose the ''-e'' (i.e. have a zero ending) but not necessarily the same as in classical Latin.<ref>Buck (1933), p.181.</ref> The ''-e'' alternates regularly with ''-us''.<ref>{{cite book|title=An introduction to vulgar Latin |first=Charles Hall |last=Grandgent|page=89|location=Boston|publisher=D.C.

This declension contains nouns that are masculine, feminine, and neuter. The stem ends in the root consonant, except in the special case where it ends in -i (i-stem declension). The i-stem, which is a vowel-stem, partially fused with the consonant-stem in the pre-Latin period and went further in Old Latin.<ref>Buck (1933), p. 197.</ref> I/y and u/w can be treated either as consonants or as vowels; hence their classification as [[semi-vowel]]s. Mixed-stem declensions are partly like consonant-stem and partly like i-stem. Consonant-stem declensions vary slightly depending on which consonant is root-final: stop-, r-, n-, s-, etc.<ref>Buck (1933), pp. 185\u2013193.</ref> The paradigms below include a stop-stem (reg-) and an i-stem (igni-).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:1em;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\"| '''r\u0113x, r\u0113ges <br> ''king'' m.'''\n! colspan=\"2\"| '''ignis -is <br> ''fire'' m.'''\n|-\n!

It is ultimately descended from the [[Proto-Italic language]].\n\nThe use of \"old\", \"early\" and \"archaic\" has been standard in publications of Old Latin writings since at least the 18th century. The definition is not arbitrary, but the terms refer to writings with spelling conventions and word forms not generally found in works written under the [[Roman Empire]].

In that period [[Cicero]], along with others, noted that the language he used every day, presumably the upper-class city Latin, included lexical items and phrases that were heirlooms from a previous time, which he called ''verborum vetustas prisca'',<ref>''De Oratoribus'', I.193.</ref> translated as \"the old age/time of language\".\n\nDuring the classical period, ''Prisca Latinitas'', ''Prisca Latina'' and other [[idiom]]s using the adjective always meant these remnants of a previous language, which, in the Roman philology, was taken to be much older in fact than it really was. ''Viri prisci'', \"old-time men\", were the population of [[Latium]] before the [[founding of Rome]].\n\n=== The four Latins of Isidore ===\nIn the [[Late Latin]] period, when Classical Latin was behind them, the Latin- and Greek-speaking grammarians were faced with multiple phases, or styles, within the language. [[Isidore of Seville]] reports a classification scheme that had come into existence in or before his time: \"the four Latins\" (\"Moreover, some people have said that there are four Latin languages\"; ''\"Latinas autem linguas quattuor esse quidam dixerunt\"'').<ref>Book IX.1.6.</ref> They were ''Prisca'', spoken before the founding of Rome, when [[Janus]] and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] ruled [[Latium]], to which he dated the ''[[Carmen Saliare]]''; ''Latina'', dated from the time of king [[Latinus]], in which period he placed the laws of the [[Twelve Tables]]; ''Romana'', essentially equal to Classical Latin; and ''Mixta'', \"mixed\" Classical Latin and [[Vulgar Latin]], which is known today as [[Late Latin]]. The scheme persisted with little change for some thousand years after Isidore.\n\n=== Old Latin ===\nIn 1874, [[John Wordsworth]] used this definition: \"By Early Latin I understand Latin of the whole period of the Republic, which is separated very strikingly, both in tone and in outward form, from that of the Empire.\"{{sfn|Wordsworth|1874|p=v}}\n\nAlthough the differences are striking and can be easily identified by Latin readers, they are not such as to cause a language barrier. Latin speakers of the empire had no reported trouble understanding Old Latin, except for the few texts that must date from the time of the [[King of Rome|kings]], mainly songs. Thus, the laws of the [[Twelve Tables]] from the early Republic were comprehensible, but the ''[[Carmen Saliare]]'', probably written under [[Numa Pompilius]], was not entirely clear (and remains thus).\n\nAn opinion concerning Old Latin, of a Roman man of letters in the middle Republic, survives: the historian, [[Polybius]],<ref>''Histories'' III.22.</ref> read \"the first treaty between Rome and Carthage\", which he says \"dates from the consulship of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] and Marcus Horatius, the first consuls after the expulsion of the kings\". Knowledge of the early consuls is somewhat obscure, but Polybius also states that the treaty was formulated 28 years before [[Xerxes I]] crossed into Greece; that is, in 508  BC, about the time of the putative date of the founding of the Roman Republic. Polybius says of the language of the treaty \"the ancient Roman language differs so much from the modern that it can only be partially made out, and that after much application by the most intelligent men\".\n\nThere is no sharp distinction between Old Latin, as it was spoken for most of the Republic, and Classical Latin, but the earlier grades into the later. The end of the republic was too late a termination for compilers after Wordsworth; [[Charles Edwin Bennett]] said, \"'Early Latin' is necessarily a somewhat vague term ... Bell, ''De locativi in prisca Latinitate vi et usu'', Breslau, 1889,<ref>{{cite book|title=De Locativi in prisca latinitate vi et usu, dissertatio inauguralis philologica|first=Andreas|last=Bell|publisher=typis Grassi, Barthi et soc (W. Friedrich)|location=Breslau|year=1889}}</ref> sets the later limit at 75 BC. A definite date is really impossible, since archaic Latin does not terminate abruptly, but continues even down to imperial times.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1910|iii}} Bennett's own date of 100 BC did not prevail but rather Bell's 75 BC became the standard as expressed in the four-volume Loeb Library and other major compendia. Over the 377 years from 452 to 75 BC, Old Latin evolved from being partially comprehensible by classicists with study to being easily read by scholars.\n\n== Corpus ==\n[[File:Praeneste fibula.JPG|thumb|300px|The Praeneste Fibula, the earliest known specimen of the [[Latin]] language and dated to the first half of the seventh century BC.]]\n[[Image:Forum inscription.jpg|thumb|200px|The Forum inscription (''[[Lapis Niger]]'', \"black stone\"), one of the oldest known Latin inscriptions, from the 6th century BC; it is written [[boustrophedon]], albeit irregularly; from a rubbing by [[Domenico Comparetti]].]]\n\nOld Latin authored works began in the 3rd century BC. These are complete or nearly complete works under their own name surviving as manuscripts copied from other manuscripts in whatever script was current at the time. In addition are fragments of works quoted in other authors.\n\nNumerous inscriptions placed by various methods (painting, engraving, embossing) on their original media survive just as they were except for the ravages of time. Some of these were copied from other inscriptions. No inscription can be earlier than the introduction of the Greek alphabet into Italy but none survive from that early date. The imprecision of archaeological dating makes it impossible to assign a year to any one inscription, but the earliest survivals are probably from the 6th century BC. Some texts, however, that survive as fragments in the works of classical authors, had to have been composed earlier than the republic, in the time of the [[Roman Kingdom|monarchy]].

The writing conventions varied by time and place until classical conventions prevailed. The works of authors in manuscript form were copied over into the scripts current in those later times. The original writing does not survive.\n\n== Orthography ==\nSome differences between old and classical Latin were of spelling only; pronunciation is thought to be essentially the same as in classical Latin:<ref>{{cite book|year=1897|last=De Forest Allen|page=8|quote=There were no such names as ''Caius'', ''Cnaius''}}</ref>\n* Single for double consonants: ''Marcelus'' for ''Marcellus''\n* Double vowels for long vowels: ''aara'' for ''\u0101ra''\n* q for c before u: ''pequnia'' for ''pecunia''\n* c for g: ''Caius'' for ''Gaius''\n\nThese differences did not necessarily run concurrently with each other and were not universal; that is, c was used for both c and g.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{See also|History of Latin}}\n[[Image:Old latin diphthongs nochar.svg|200px|thumb|Diphthong changes from Old Latin (left) to Classical Latin (right)<ref>Allen (1897), p.6</ref>]]\n\n=== Stress ===\nOld Latin is thought to have had a strong stress on the first syllable of a word until about 250 BC. All syllables other than the first were unstressed and were subjected to greater amounts of phonological weakening. Starting around that year, the Classical Latin stress system began to develop. It passed through at least one intermediate stage, found in [[Plautus]], in which the stress occurred on the fourth last syllable in four-syllable words with all short syllables.\n\n=== Vowels and diphthongs ===\nMost original PIE ([[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]) diphthongs were preserved in stressed syllables, including {{IPA|/ai/}} (later ''ae''); {{IPA|/ei/}} (later ''\u012b''); {{IPA|/oi/}} (later ''\u016b'', or sometimes ''oe''); {{IPA|/ou/}} (from PIE {{IPA|/eu/}} and {{IPA|/ou/}}; later ''\u016b'').\n\nThe Old Latin diphthong ''ei'' evolves in stages: ''ei'' > ''\u1eb9\u0304'' > ''\u012b''. The intermediate sound ''\u1eb9\u0304'' was simply written ''e'' but must have been distinct from the normal long vowel ''\u0113'' because ''\u1eb9\u0304'' subsequently merged with ''\u012b'' while ''\u0113'' did not. It is generally thought that ''\u1eb9\u0304'' was a higher sound than ''e'' (e.g. perhaps {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} vs. {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}} during the time when both sounds existed). Even after the original vowel {{IPA|/ei/}} had merged with ''\u012b'', the old spelling ''ei'' continued to be used for a while, with the result that ''ei'' came to stand for ''\u012b'' and began to be used in the spelling of original occurrences of ''\u012b'' that did not evolve from ''ei'' (e.g. in the genitive singular ''-\u012b'', which is always spelled ''-i'' in the oldest inscriptions but later on can be spelled either ''-i'' or ''-ei'').\n\nIn unstressed syllables, *oi and *ai had already merged into ''ei'' by historic times (except for one possible occurrence of ''poploe'' for ''popul\u012b'' \"people\" in a late manuscript of one of the early songs). This eventually evolved to ''\u012b'' according to the process described above.\n\nOld Latin often had different short vowels from Classical Latin, reflecting sound changes that had not yet taken place. For example, the very early [[Duenos inscription]] has the form ''duenos'' \"good\", later found as ''duonos'' and still later ''bonus''. A countervailing change ''wo'' > ''we'' occurred around 150 BC in certain contexts, and many earlier forms are found (e.g. earlier ''vot\u014d, voster, vorsus'' vs. later ''vet\u014d, vester, versus'').\n\nOld Latin frequently preserves original PIE thematic case endings ''[[Old Latin#Second declension .28b.29|-os]]'' and ''[[Old Latin#Second declension .28b.29|-om]]'' (later ''-us'' and ''-um'').\n\n===Consonants===\nIntervocalic {{IPA|/s/}} (pronounced {{IPA|[z]}}) was preserved up through 350 BC or so, at which point it changed into {{IPA|/r/}} (called [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]). This rhotacism had implications for declension: early classical Latin, ''honos'', ''honoris'' (from ''honos'', ''honoses''); later Classical (by [[Morphological leveling|analogy]]) ''honor'', ''honoris'' (\"honor\"). Some Old Latin texts preserve {{IPA|/s/}} in this position, such as the [[Carmen Arvale]]'s ''lases'' for ''[[lares]]''.  Later instances of single {{IPA|/s/}} between vowels are mostly due either to reduction of early {{IPA|/ss/}} after long vowels or diphthongs; borrowings; or late reconstructions.\n\nThere are many unreduced clusters, e.g. ''iouxmentom'' (later ''i\u016bmentum'', \"beast of burden\"); ''losna'' (later ''l\u016bna'', \"moon\") < *''lousna'' < */leuksn\u0101/; ''cosmis'' (later ''c\u014dmis'', \"courteous\"); ''stlocum'', acc. (later ''locum'', \"place\").\n\nEarly ''du'' {{IPA|/dw/}} becomes later ''b'': ''duenos'' > ''duonos'' > ''bonus'' \"good\"; ''duis'' > ''bis'' \"twice\"; ''duellom'' > ''bellum'' \"war\".\n\nFinal {{IPA|/d/}} occurred in ablatives, such as ''puell\u0101d'' \"from the girl\" or ''camp\u014dd'' \"from the field\", later ''puell\u0101'' and ''camp\u014d''. In verb conjugation, the third-person ending -''d'' later became -''t'', e.g. Old Latin ''faced'' > Classical ''facit.''\n\n==Morphology==\n===Nouns===\nLatin [[noun]]s are distinguished by [[grammatical case]], with a termination, or suffix, determining its use in the sentence: subject, predicate, etc. A case for a given word is formed by suffixing a case ending to a part of the word common to all its cases called a [[Word stem|stem]]. Stems are classified by their last letters as vowel or consonant. Vowel stems are formed by adding a suffix to a shorter and more ancient segment called a [[Root (linguistics)|root]]. Consonant stems are the root (roots end in consonants). The combination of the last letter of the stem and the case ending often results in an ending also called a case ending or termination. For example, the stem ''puella-'' receives a case ending ''-m'' to form the accusative case ''puellam'' in which the termination ''-am'' is evident.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Latin grammar|first=Charles Edwin |last=Bennett|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston, Chicago|year=1915|origyear=1895, 1908|page=12}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Classical Latin]] textbooks the declensions are named from the letter ending the stem or First, Second, etc. to Fifth. A declension may be illustrated by a [[paradigm]], or listing of all the cases of a typical word. This method is less frequently applied to Old Latin, and with less validity. In contrast to Classical Latin, Old Latin reflects the evolution of the language from an unknown hypothetical ancestor spoken in [[Latium]]. The endings are multiple. Their use depends on time and locality. Any paradigm selected would be subject to these constraints and if applied to the language universally would result in false constructs, hypothetical words not attested in the Old Latin corpus. Nevertheless, the endings are illustrated below by quasi-classical paradigms. Alternative endings from different stages of development are given, but they may not be attested for the word of the paradigm. For example, in the second declension, *''campoe'' \"fields\" is unattested, but ''poploe'' \"peoples\" is attested.\n\nThe locative was a separate case in Old Latin but gradually became reduced in function, and the locative singular form eventually merged with the genitive singular by regular sound change. In the plural, the locative was captured by the ablative case in all Italic languages before Old Latin.<ref>{{cite book|page=204|title=A Grammar Of Oscan And Umbrian: With A Collection Of Inscriptions And A Glossary|first=Carl Darling|last=Buck|series=Languages of classical antiquity, vol. 5|location=Bristol, Pa.|publisher=Evolution Publishing|year=2005|origyear=1904}}</ref>\n\n====First declension (a)====\nThe 'A-stem' declension.
