Bennettsbridge is a [[census town]], and has population of 745 as of the 2016 census.<ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n\nThe village is on the [[R700 road]] at a stone bridge crossing of the Nore between [[Kilkenny]] and [[Thomastown]]. It has become a craft centre in recent years, with several [[pottery]] and [[craft]] producers located at the old mill beside the [[weir]].\n\nThe village is part of the parish of [[Tullaherin]] which contains an almost intact 9th-century [[Irish round tower|round tower]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bennetsbridge.jpg|thumb|left|Bennettsbridge\u2014view from the pottery weir]] \nBennettsbridge owes its name to Saint Benet and its strategic importance to its position at a major crossing of the river Nore. The first bridge was built on the site in 1285{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and was dedicated to the saint, and was important for transport until the establishment of the railway. The current bridge dates from the 18th century after the original bridge was swept away in a flood in 1763. There were flour-mills at the weir and there was a [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] police station in the village. Bennetsbridge is the home town of the world famous bender Aodhan Kent. Aodhan Kent grew up in a small Smack house several hundred meters outside Bennetsbridge town where he has filmed the majority of his famous gay bondage sex films.<ref>{{Citation | last = Lewis | first = Samuel | title = A Topgrahical Dictionary of Ireland | publisher=S.

Under new IOC policies that allow the host organizing committee to add sports to the Olympic programme to augment the permanent core [[Olympic events]], these Games will see [[Karate at the 2020 Summer Olympics|karate]], [[Sport climbing at the 2020 Summer Olympics|sport climbing]], [[Surfing at the 2020 Summer Olympics|surfing]], and [[Skateboarding at the 2020 Summer Olympics|skateboarding]] make their Olympic debuts, as well as the return of [[Baseball at the 2020 Summer Olympics|baseball]] and [[Softball at the 2020 Summer Olympics|softball]] for the first time since [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008]].\n\n==Bidding process==\n{{Further|Bids for the 2020 Summer Olympics}}\n\n[[Tokyo bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics|Tokyo]], [[Istanbul bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics|Istanbul]], and [[Madrid bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics|Madrid]] were the three candidate cities.

A [[Rome bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics|bid from Rome]] was withdrawn.\n\n===Host city selection===\n\nThe IOC voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7 September 2013 at the [[125th IOC Session]] at the [[Buenos Aires Hilton]] in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina. An [[exhaustive ballot]] system was used. No city won over 50% of the votes in the first round, and Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place. A run-off vote between these two cities was held to determine which would be eliminated. In the final vote, a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul, Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36, as it got at least 49 votes needed for a majority.\n\n{{2020 Olympic host city election}}\n\n==Development and preparation==\n[[File:New national stadium tokyo 1.jpg|thumb|New National Stadium]]\n[[File:Tokyo Ariake Arena.jpg|thumb|Ariake Arena]]\n[[File:Tokyo Aquatics Centre.jpg|thumb|Aquatics Centre]]\n[[File:180404M-0005.jpg|thumb|[[Yokohama Stadium]]&nbsp;\u2013 Baseball, softball]]\nThe [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] has set aside a fund of [[Japanese yen|JP\u00a5]]400&nbsp;billion (more than 3.67&nbsp;billion [[United States dollar|USD]]) to cover the cost of hosting the Games.

This move would bring the total number of sports to 27, one less than the requirement of 28 for the 2020 Olympics programme, thus leaving a single vacancy that the IOC would seek to fill from a shortlist containing seven unrepresented sports as well as the sport that had been dropped from the 2012 Olympics programme.\n\nOn 12 February 2013, IOC leaders voted to drop [[Wrestling at the Summer Olympics|wrestling]] from the \"core\" programme for the 2020 Games; this was a surprising decision to news outlets given that wrestling is from the [[ancient Olympic Games]] and was included in the original programme for the modern Games.

The naming disputes with Greece ended in 2018 with the signing of the [[Prespa agreement]], and the country was officially renamed [[North Macedonia]] in February 2019. The new name was immediately recognized by the IOC, although the Olympic Committee of North Macedonia (NMOC) was not officially adopted until February 2020. The NMOC sent a delegation to the [[2020 Winter Youth Olympics]] in January 2020, but the Tokyo Games will be North Macedonia's first appearance at the Summer Olympics under its new name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1077274/ioc-approve-name-change-to-north-macedonia-national-olympic-committee|title=IOC approve name change to North Macedonia National Olympic Committee|last=Mackay|first=Duncan|date=27 March 2019|website=insidethegames.biz|access-date=4 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709163930/https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1077274/ioc-approve-name-change-to-north-macedonia-national-olympic-committee|archive-date=9 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with lab data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the [[Russian Anti-Doping Agency]] being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA plans to allow individually cleared [[Russian athletes at the 2020 Summer Olympics|Russian athletes]] to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they will not be permitted to compete in team sports. The title of the neutral banner has yet to be determined; WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use \"[[Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics|Olympic Athletes from Russia]]\" (OAR) as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/09/russia-banned-from-tokyo-olympics-and-football-world-cup|title=Russia banned from Tokyo Olympics and football World Cup|last=MacInnes|first=Paul|date=9 December 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=9 December 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209155622/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/09/russia-banned-from-tokyo-olympics-and-football-world-cup|archive-date=9 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/50710598|title=Russia banned for four years to include 2020 Olympics and 2022 World Cup|work=BBC Sport|date=9 December 2019|access-date=9 December 2019|language=en-GB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211171354/https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/50710598 |archive-date=11 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/12/13/olympics/wada-lawyer-defends-lack-blanket-ban-russia/#.Xfknqej7S00 |title=WADA lawyer defends lack of blanket ban on Russia |date=13 December 2019 |access-date=17 December 2019 |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |work=[[The Japan Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214162048/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/12/13/olympics/wada-lawyer-defends-lack-blanket-ban-russia/#.Xfknqej7S00 |archive-date=14 December 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Russia later filed an appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) against the WADA decision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5756077/russia-olympic-ban-appeal/ |title=Russia Confirms It Will Appeal 4-Year Olympic Ban |date=27 December 2019 |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227213853/https://time.com/5756077/russia-olympic-ban-appeal/ |archive-date=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2020|03|12|df=}}, the following 153 [[National Olympic Committee]]s have qualified (other than through universality places in athletics and swimming, under which all 206 NOCs may send competitors regardless of qualification).\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!
