Each submarine is assigned two complete crews, called the Blue crew and the Gold crew, each typically serving 70-to-90-day deterrent patrols. To decrease the time in port for crew turnover and replenishment, three large logistics hatches have been installed to provide large-diameter resupply and repair access. These hatches allow rapid transfer of supply pallets, equipment replacement modules, and machinery components, speeding up replenishment and maintenance of the submarines. Moreover, the \"stealth\" ability of the submarines was significantly improved over all previous ballistic-missile subs. '' Ohio'' was virtually undetectable in her sea trials in 1982, giving the U.S. Navy extremely advanced flexibility.<ref>D. Douglas Dalgleish and Larry Schweikart, Trident.

Each SSBN submarine is armed with up to 24 [[UGM-133 Trident II|Trident II]] [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBM). Each SSGN is capable of carrying 154 [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] [[cruise missile]]s, plus a complement of [[Harpoon missile]]s to be fired through their [[torpedo tube]]s.\n\nAs part of the [[New START]] treaty, four tubes on each SSBN will be deactivated, leaving each ship with only 20 available for war loads.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hans M.

The first eight ''Ohio''-class submarines were armed at first with 24 Trident I C4 SLBMs.<ref name=\"Adcock_p40\" /> Beginning with the ninth Trident submarine, {{USS|Tennessee|SSBN-734|2}}, the remaining boats were equipped with the larger, three-stage [[Trident missile|Trident II D5 missile]].<ref name=\"Adcock_p41\" /> The Trident I missile carries eight [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s, while the Trident II missile carries 12, in total delivering more destructive power than the Trident I missile and with greater accuracy. Starting with {{USS|Alaska|SSBN-732|2}} in 2000, the Navy began converting its remaining ballistic missile submarines armed with C4 missiles to carry D5 missiles. This task was completed in mid-2008. The first eight submarines had their home ports at [[Naval Base Kitsap|Bangor, Washington]], to replace the submarines carrying [[Polaris missile|Polaris A3 missile]]s that were then being decommissioned. The remaining 10 submarines originally had their home ports at [[Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay|Kings Bay, Georgia]], replacing the [[Poseidon missile|Poseidon]] and Trident Backfit submarines of the Atlantic Fleet. \n\n=== SSBN/SSGN conversions ===\n[[File:OHIOSSGNCONVERSION.JPG|thumb|right|USS ''Ohio'' being converted from an SSBN to an SSGN in March 2004|alt=Black submarine with orange paint from cheatline down in drydock at nightfall]]\n\nIn 1994, the [[Nuclear Posture Review]] study determined that, of the 18 ''Ohio'' SSBNs the U.S. Navy would be operating in total, 14 would be sufficient for the strategic needs of the U.S. The decision was made to convert four ''Ohio''-class boats into SSGNs capable of conducting conventional [[Military strike|land attack]] and [[Special forces|special operations]].

Those funds covered only the initial phase of conversion for the first two boats on the schedule. Advanced procurement was funded at $355 million in [[fiscal year]] 2002, $825 million in the FY 2003 budget and, through the five-year defense budget plan, at $936 million in FY 2004, $505 million in FY 2005, and $170 million in FY 2006.

Each submarine is assigned two complete crews, called the Blue crew and the Gold crew, each typically serving 70-to-90-day deterrent patrols. To decrease the time in port for crew turnover and replenishment, three large logistics hatches have been installed to provide large-diameter resupply and repair access. These hatches allow rapid transfer of supply pallets, equipment replacement modules, and machinery components, speeding up replenishment and maintenance of the submarines. Moreover, the \"stealth\" ability of the submarines was significantly improved over all previous ballistic-missile subs. '' Ohio'' was virtually undetectable in her sea trials in 1982, giving the U.S. Navy extremely advanced flexibility.<ref>D. Douglas Dalgleish and Larry Schweikart, Trident.

Each SSBN submarine is armed with up to 24 [[UGM-133 Trident II|Trident II]] [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBM). Each SSGN is capable of carrying 154 [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] [[cruise missile]]s, plus a complement of [[Harpoon missile]]s to be fired through their [[torpedo tube]]s.\n\nAs part of the [[New START]] treaty, four tubes on each SSBN will be deactivated, leaving each ship with only 20 available for war loads.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hans M.

The first eight ''Ohio''-class submarines were armed at first with 24 Trident I C4 SLBMs.<ref name=\"Adcock_p40\" /> Beginning with the ninth Trident submarine, {{USS|Tennessee|SSBN-734|2}}, the remaining boats were equipped with the larger, three-stage [[Trident missile|Trident II D5 missile]].<ref name=\"Adcock_p41\" /> The Trident I missile carries eight [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s, while the Trident II missile carries 12, in total delivering more destructive power than the Trident I missile and with greater accuracy. Starting with {{USS|Alaska|SSBN-732|2}} in 2000, the Navy began converting its remaining ballistic missile submarines armed with C4 missiles to carry D5 missiles. This task was completed in mid-2008. The first eight submarines had their home ports at [[Naval Base Kitsap|Bangor, Washington]], to replace the submarines carrying [[Polaris missile|Polaris A3 missile]]s that were then being decommissioned. The remaining 10 submarines originally had their home ports at [[Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay|Kings Bay, Georgia]], replacing the [[Poseidon missile|Poseidon]] and Trident Backfit submarines of the Atlantic Fleet. \n\n=== SSBN/SSGN conversions ===\n[[File:OHIOSSGNCONVERSION.JPG|thumb|right|USS ''Ohio'' being converted from an SSBN to an SSGN in March 2004|alt=Black submarine with orange paint from cheatline down in drydock at nightfall]]\n\nIn 1994, the [[Nuclear Posture Review]] study determined that, of the 18 ''Ohio'' SSBNs the U.S. Navy would be operating in total, 14 would be sufficient for the strategic needs of the U.S. The decision was made to convert four ''Ohio''-class boats into SSGNs capable of conducting conventional [[Military strike|land attack]] and [[Special forces|special operations]].

Improved communications equipment installed during the upgrade allows the SSGNs to serve as a forward-deployed, clandestine Small Combatant Joint Command Center.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gdeb.com/news/ebnews/ebnews0206.pdf |format=pdf |type=Newsletter |title=USS Ohio Returns To Service As Navy's First SSGN |work=Electric Boat News |publisher=[[General Dynamics Electric Boat]] |date=February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731060602/http://www.gdeb.com/news/ebnews/ebnews0206.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-31}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 September 2002, the Navy awarded [[General Dynamics Electric Boat]] a US$442.9 million contract to begin the first phase of the SSGN submarine conversion program. Those funds covered only the initial phase of conversion for the first two boats on the schedule. Advanced procurement was funded at $355 million in [[fiscal year]] 2002, $825 million in the FY 2003 budget and, through the five-year defense budget plan, at $936 million in FY 2004, $505 million in FY 2005, and $170 million in FY 2006. Thus, the total cost to refit the four boats is just under $700 million per vessel.\n\nIn November 2002, ''Ohio'' entered a [[drydock|dry-dock]], beginning her 36-month [[Refueling and Overhaul|refueling and missile-conversion overhaul]]. Electric Boat announced on 9 January 2006 that the conversion had been completed. The converted ''Ohio'' rejoined the fleet in February 2006, followed by ''Florida'' in April 2006. The converted ''Michigan'' was delivered in November 2006. The converted ''Ohio'' went to sea for the first time in October 2007. ''Georgia'' returned to the fleet in March 2008 at [[Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay|Kings Bay]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atlanta.navyleague.us/ |title=Navy Marks USS Georgia's Return To Service |publisher=CBS 4 News Jacksonville |accessdate=2008-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305110754/http://atlanta.navyleague.us/ |archive-date=5 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}{{Failed verification |date=September 2011}}</ref> These four SSGNs are expected to remain in service until about 2023\u20132026.

The station is owned by the [[CBS Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[ViacomCBS]], as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with [[Riverhead (CDP), New York|Riverhead]]-licensed [[independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WLNY-TV]] (channel 55). The two stations share studios within the [[CBS Broadcast Center]] on West 57th Street in [[Midtown Manhattan]]; WCBS-TV's transmitter is located at [[One World Trade Center]]. \n\nIn the few areas of the [[eastern United States]] where a CBS station is not receivable [[Terrestrial television|over the air]], WCBS is available on [[DirecTV]] and select [[cable television|cable]] systems.\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1931\u20131951)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}\nWCBS-TV's history dates back to CBS' opening of experimental station '''W2XAB''' on July 21, [[1931 in television|1931]], using the [[mechanical television]] system that had been more-or-less perfected in the late 1920s. Its first broadcast featured [[list of mayors of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Jimmy Walker]], [[Kate Smith]], and [[George Gershwin]].<ref>[http://earlytelevision.org/pdf/cbs_1931_program.pdf Inaugural Broadcast Program]</ref> The station had the first regular seven-day broadcasting schedule in American television, broadcasting 28 hours a week. Among its early programming included ''[[The Television Ghost]]'' (1931\u20131933), ''[[Helen Haynes]]'' (1931\u20131932) and ''[[Piano Lessons (TV series)|Piano Lessons]]'' (1931\u20131932).\n\nAnnouncer-director Bill Schudt was the station's only paid employee; all other staff were volunteers. W2XAB pioneered program development including small-scale dramatic acts, monologues, pantomime, and the use of projection slides to simulate sets. Engineer Bill Lodge<ref name=\"II2000\">{{cite book|author=Lawrence H. Rogers, II|title=History of U.S. Television: A Personal Reminiscence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U58P6s4mx3cC&pg=PA59|date=July 2000|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-58500-825-4|pages=59\u2013}}</ref> devised the first synchronized sound wave for a television station in 1932, enabling W2XAB to broadcast picture and sound on a single [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]] channel instead of the two previously needed. On November 8, 1932, W2XAB broadcast the first television coverage of presidential election returns. The station suspended operations on February 20, 1933, as monochrome television transmission standards were in flux, and in the process of changing from a mechanical to an all-electronic system. W2XAB returned with an all-electronic system in 1939 from a new studio complex in [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] and a transmitter located at the [[Chrysler Building]] broadcasting on channel 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/w2xab.html |title=W2XAB \u2013 CBS, New York |publisher=Earlytelevision.org |date= |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref> W2XAB transmitted the first color broadcast in the United States on August 28, 1940.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm |title=CBS Color Television System Chronology |publisher=Novia.net |accessdate=October 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922013759/http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm |archivedate=September 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 1941, W2XAB received a commercial [[Planning_permission#Broadcasting|construction permit]] and program authorization as '''WCBW'''. The station went on the air at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. on July 1, one hour after rival [[WNBC|WNBT]] (channel 1, formerly W2XBS), making it the second authorized fully commercial television station in the United States. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) issued permits to CBS and NBC at the same time and intended WNBT and WCBW to sign on simultaneously on July 1, so no one station could claim to be the \"first\". WCBW's initial broadcast was the first local newscast aired on a commercial station in the country. Its assigned frequency was 60\u201366&nbsp;MHz, now known as channel 3 but then referred to as Channel 2 in the 1940\u201346 alignment of the VHF band.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nProgram schedules were irregular through the summer and early fall of 1941. Regular daily operations began on October 29 and WCBW received a full [[Broadcast license]], its construction permit and commercial program authorization on March 10, 1942. After the war, the FCC re-allocated the television and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] bands. WCBW closed down its operation on the old channel 2 at the end of February 1946 (the 60\u201366&nbsp;MHz band had been re-allocated to [[KYW-TV|WPTZ]] in Philadelphia as channel 3) in order to move to a new channel 2 at 54\u201360&nbsp;MHz. It quickly began operation on the new frequency, where it remained from the spring of 1946 until the end of analog full power television service in the late spring of 2009.\n\nThe call letters were changed to '''WCBS-TV''' on November 1, 1946, after the FCC allowed television stations owned by radio stations in the same city to use the same call letters as the radio station with the suffix ''-TV''\u2014it is the only station in the CBS-owned station group to have been built from the ground up by the network.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Later analog years (1951\u20132008)===\n{{expand section|more information on the station from the 1950s to the present day|date=February 2011}}\nOn February 26, 1951, WCBS-TV became the first station to broadcast a regularly scheduled feature film series, ''The Late Show''. On August 11, 1951, WCBS-TV broadcast the first baseball game on [[color television]], between the [[1951 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[1951 Boston Braves season|Boston Braves]] from [[Ebbets Field]]. As were all color programs at the time, it was transmitted via a [[field-sequential color system]] developed by CBS. Signals transmitted this way could not be seen on existing black-and-white sets. The CBS color system was scrapped after the FCC embraced the alternative [[RCA]] all-electronic dot sequential system, which was fully compatible with the existing monochrome television standard, late in 1953. However, CBS telecast few programs in color, either locally or through the network, until the mid-1960s when color television sets became more affordable to the American public.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n[[File:WCBS-TV 2 logo.png|right|215px|thumb|Variant used by the station from 2013 to 2016; the logo was used from 1997 to 2016.]]\n\nIn May 1997, the station adopted the \"CBS 2\" branding, along with sister stations [[KCBS-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]] and [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]], while retaining a unique and distinctive logo.\n\nWCBS-TV's over-the air signal was not affected by the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] that destroyed the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].

The games, produced by the new [[YES Network]], remained in the station until the [[2004 New York Yankees season|2004 season]]; the rights moved to [[UPN]] affiliate (now [[MyNetworkTV]] owned-and-operated station) [[WWOR-TV]] beginning in [[2005 New York Yankees season|2005]]. It also aired any Yankee or [[New York Mets|Met]] games as part of CBS' MLB broadcast contract from 1990 to 1993.\n\nFrom [[1956 NFL season|1956]] until [[1993 NFL season|1993]], WCBS-TV carried most [[New York Giants]] games through [[NFL on CBS|the network's coverage]] of the [[National Football League]]. CBS lost the rights to the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) to [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox]] in [[1994 NFL season|1994]], resulting in Giants games moving to WNYW; currently, Giants preseason games are carried by [[NBC]] owned-and-operated station WNBC (with WWOR-TV being served as an overflow station if the [[Olympics on NBC|Summer Olympics]] conflicts the preseason schedule). After a 5-year absence, the NFL returned to CBS and WCBS-TV in 1998 through a package of [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) games; the station currently airs [[New York Jets]] preseason games and most regular season games, along with occasional Giants games, usually when the team plays host to an AFC opponent at [[MetLife Stadium]] (or, since 2014, through the 'cross-flex' broadcast rules, any Giants games where they play another NFC team that are moved from Fox to CBS). The station also aired occasional Jets games when they played at home to an NFC team from 1970 to 1993. During the regular season, some Jets games are rotated with WNBC (through ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]''), WNYW (through ''[[NFL on Fox]]'' and ''[[Thursday Night Football]]''), [[WABC-TV]] (through ''[[Monday Night Football]]''), [[WPIX]] (through ''Monday Night Football'', if WABC-TV is not airing them) and select TNF telecasts not carried by Fox's package it shares with NFL Network), and in rare cases, WWOR-TV (through ''Monday Night Football''). The station has aired the Giants' victory in [[Super Bowl XXI]] and loss in [[Super Bowl XXXV]].\n\nIn 1980, WCBS-TV aired Game 6 of the [[1980 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] via an episode of ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular]]'', where the [[New York Islanders]] won their first of four straight [[Stanley Cup]]s.\n\n===News operation===\nWCBS-TV presently broadcasts 33 hours, 5 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5 hours, 5 minutes each weekday; 3 hours, 5 minutes on Saturdays and 4 hours, 35 minutes on Sundays). Like other CBS-owned stations, WCBS-TV offers a web only newscast called \"CBS 2 at Your Desk\", available weekdays at 9 a.m. Also, available are streamlined editions of the noon, 5 and 6, and the 11 p.m. newscasts. There is also a \"LoHud Report\" edition of \"At Your Desk\", operated by WCBS-TV and LoHud.com, the website for ''[[The Journal News]]'', a [[Gannett|Gannett Company]]-owned newspaper covering the lower [[Hudson Valley]]. ''The Journal News'' has a partnership with the station where WCBS-TV uses the newspaper's offices for its Westchester Bureau, and ''The Journal News'' gets a 30-second promotion during the 6 p.m. newscast for the next day's top story.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nWCBS-TV cooperates with sister station KYW-TV in Philadelphia in the production and broadcast of statewide [[New Jersey]] political debates. When the two stations broadcast a statewide office debate, such as for [[Governor of New Jersey|Governor]] or [[United States Senate]], they will pool resources and have anchors or reporters from both stations participate in the debate. Additionally, the two stations cooperate in the gathering of news in New Jersey where their markets overlap; sharing reporters, live trucks and helicopters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n====History====\nUpon becoming commercial station WCBW in 1941, the station broadcast two daily news programs, at 2:30 and 7:30&nbsp;p.m. weekdays, anchored by Richard Hubbell.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.poynter.org/archive/2006/early-tv-anchors/ |title=Early TV Anchors |work=poynter.org |accessdate=May 19, 2019}}</ref> Most of the newscasts featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph. When Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941, WCBW (which was usually off the air on Sunday to give the engineers a day off), took to the air at 8:45&nbsp;p.m. that Sunday with an extensive special report. The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to the Grand Central Station studios during the evening and give information and commentary on the attack. The WCBW special report that night lasted less than 90 minutes. But that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC, the unscheduled live news broadcast on December 7 \u201cwas unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time.\u201d Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war. In May 1942, WCBW (like almost all television stations) sharply cut back its live program schedule and the newscasts were cancelled, since the station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily due to the fact that much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war-related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the wartime lack of parts.\n\nIn May 1944, as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened the studios and the newscasts returned, briefly anchored by [[Ned Calmer]], and then by Everett Holles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/pub/libs/images/usr/7533_h.jpg |title=Black and white television studio photograph |publisher=Newsinfo.iu.edu |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref> After the war, expanded news programs appeared on the WCBW schedule\u2014renamed WCBS-TV in 1946\u2014first anchored by Milo Boulton and later by [[Douglas Edwards]]. On May 3, 1948, Douglas Edwards began anchoring ''CBS Television News'', a regular 15-minute nightly newscast on the rudimentary CBS network, including WCBS-TV. It aired every weeknight at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. and was the first regularly scheduled network television news program featuring an anchor. The NBC television network's offering at the time ''NBC Television Newsreel'' (premiering in February 1948) was simply film with voice narration. In 1950, the name of the nightly news was changed to ''Douglas Edwards with the News'', and the following year, it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts, thanks to a new coaxial cable connection, prompting Edwards to use the greeting \"Good evening everyone, coast to coast.\" The broadcast was renamed the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' when [[Walter Cronkite]] replaced Edwards in 1962.<ref>\"The Origins Of Television News In America\" by Mike Conway. Chapter: \"The Birth of CBS-TV News: Columbia's Ambitious Experiment at the Advent of U.S. Commercial Television\". (Peter Lang Publishing, New York NY).</ref> Edwards remained with CBS News with various daytime television newscasts and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April 1, 1988.\n\nIn the 1950s through the mid-1960s, WCBS-TV's local newscasts were anchored by CBS News correspondents [[Robert Trout]] (at 7 p.m.) and by [[Don Hollenbeck]] and later Douglas Edwards (at 11 p.m.). Beginning in 1965, production of local news broadcasts on WCBS-TV and other CBS-owned television stations, which had been previously produced by CBS News, were taken over by the local stations. Trout and Edwards were succeeded by [[Jim Jensen (reporter)|Jim Jensen]]. Jensen had only come to WCBS-TV a year earlier (he had been at [[WBZ-TV]] in Boston), but was already well known for his coverage of [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s 1964 campaign for the United States Senate. During the 1960s, WCBS-TV battled WNBC-TV (channel 4) for the top-rated news department in New York City. After WABC-TV (channel 7) introduced ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' in the late 1960s, WCBS-TV went back and forth in first place with Channel 7, in a rivalry that continued through the 1970s. For much of the early 1980s, New York's \"Big Three\" stations took turns in the top spot. During this time, three of the longest-tenured anchor teams in New York \u2013 Jensen and [[Rolland Smith]], WABC-TV's [[Roger Grimsby]] and [[Bill Beutel]], and WNBC-TV's [[Chuck Scarborough]] and [[Sue Simmons]] \u2013 went head-to-head with each other. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nWCBS-TV had many well-known personalities during this era: anchors [[Dave Marash]], Rolland Smith, [[Michele Marsh (reporter)|Michele Marsh]] and Vic Miles; [[meteorologist]]s [[Frank Field (meteorologist)|Dr. Frank Field]] and [[John Coleman (meteorologist)|John Coleman]]; reporters [[Meredith Vieira]], [[Randall Pinkston]], [[Tony Guida]], [[John Stossel]] and [[Arnold D\u00edaz]] and sportscaster [[Warner Wolf]]. Vieira, Pinkston and Guida later moved to the CBS network. Vieira later moved to NBC where she co-hosted the morning show ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]'' until leaving in 2011 and being replaced with [[Ann Curry]].\n\nIn 1987, WABC-TV surged to first place. As the 1990s began, Channel 2 found itself increasingly losing its ratings share to WNBC. One of management's more controversial responses was to take Jensen off the anchor desk in late 1994 and demote him to host of a Sunday morning [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public-affairs]] show, ''Sunday Edition''. He also hosted a few episodes of the regular \"Sports Update\" show on Sunday nights at 11:30&nbsp;p.m. At the time, Jensen had served as an anchor longer than anyone in New York television history (he has since been passed by WABC-TV's Beutel and WNBC's Scarborough). The move was roundly criticized by many in New York, especially since WCBS-TV had supported him after he went into [[drug rehabilitation]] in 1988. Another controversy involved an exchange between Jensen and co-anchor [[Bree Walker]], whose fingers and toes are fused together as a result of the condition [[ectrodactyly]]. After Walker did a report about her experience with the condition, Jensen asked Walker, on the air, if her parents would have aborted her had they known she would have been born with the condition. Walker kept her composure on air but soon left the station.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-_UR93_9Ro |title=Anchor Jim Jensen Gets Too Personal With Bree Walker |publisher=YouTube |date=August 2, 2008 |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe incident took place shortly before Jensen's entry to drug rehabilitation. Station management came under more fire in 1995 when Jensen was forced to retire shortly after the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] announced it was buying CBS. By the end of 1995, Channel 2 had crashed into last place for the first time in its history while WNBC surged to a strong second place \u2013 a pecking order that would remain in place for eleven years. The station's news branding change from ''Channel 2 News'' to just ''2 News'' during that time contributed to the station's last-place finish in the February 1996 sweeps period.\n\n====1996 \"massacre\": Mass firings and format changes====\n[[Image:WCBS-TV news 90s.png|140px|thumb|right|WCBS-TV's news logo from 1997 to 2000]]\nOn October 2, 1996, the station executed an unprecedented mass firing without any advance warning, citing the need to shake up its news operation. Seven people were fired: anchors [[John Johnson (reporter)|John Johnson]], Michele Marsh and Tony Guida; sports anchor Bernie Smilovitz (who promptly returned to his previous station, [[WDIV]] in Detroit); and reporters Reggie Harris, Roseanne Colletti and Magee Hickey.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news | title = At WCBS-TV, a Big Round Of News Staff Dismissals | first = Richard | last = Sandomir | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E3D7143FF930A35753C1A960958260 | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = October 3, 1996 | accessdate = September 13, 2009}}</ref> The firings came after the 6 p.m. newscast. Johnson and Marsh had anchored the 5 p.m. newscasts and signed off at 6 p.m. saying, \"We'll see you at 11,\" but never got a chance to say goodbye on the air.\n\nThe \"massacre,\" as it has come to be known, was part of a move enacted by then-news director Bill Carey to boost ratings, although it came at a time when CBS was under pressure to boost revenues, having just merged with Westinghouse. It was also part of a major reconstruction of the newscast, culminating in the May 1997 rebranding to ''News 2''; 2 months prior, Warner Wolf had returned to the station, having left in 1992 for [[WUSA-TV]], the CBS affiliate in Washington.\n\nWhen the ''News 2'' name was put in place, a format change was also instituted, going for a faster-paced newscast with more stories; this was reinforced by reminders that ''News 2'' had \"More news in less time, everytime\" and a \"Rundown\" of stories to come. After a year, little to no progress in the ratings was made, so this format was done away with; a new \"Virtual studio\" format, alongside bright, orange and white graphics and a \"club\" remix of WBBM-TV's \"I Love Chicago, Chicago My Home\" theme (which the station has used in various forms for all but a few years since 1982) was tried out. This did not work either, so this approach was junked, in favor of a more \"traditional\" newscast. The \"club\" remix of the WBBM theme would continue to be used until early 2000.\n\n====CBS 2 News====\n[[Image:Cbs2hdlogo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|\"CBS 2 News\" nighttime open from September 22, 2013 to April 21, 2016. On April 22, 2016, the logo was changed to a new numeric \"2\" for the first time since 1997, in the same font used by [[WBBM-TV]] and [[KCBS-TV]], also used since 1997.]]\nIn 2000, [[Joel Cheatwood]], creator of the ''7 News'' format at [[WSVN]] in [[Miami]], was appointed as the station's news director. At his suggestion, the newscasts were rebranded from ''News 2'' to ''the CBS 2 Information Network,'' using \"content partners\" such as ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' and VH1. He also gave the newscasts more of a [[tabloid television|tabloid]] feel. While considerably watered down compared to Bill Applegate's work at WBBM-TV in Chicago, John Lippmann's work at KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] flagship WNYW, and Cheatwood's work at WSVN \u2013 and even compared to WSVN's sister station, [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] in [[Boston]]\u2014it was much flashier than had been seen on New York's \"Big Three\" affiliates. He also retooled the 11 p.m. report as a \"gritty, down-to-earth\" style newscast, termed ''Nightcast''. At this point, the station was sharing studio space with [[CBS Sports]] (having shared street-side studios with CBS' then-morning newscast, ''[[The Early Show]]'', as a part of its short-lived attempt at a newscast at 4 p.m., which they had attempted in the early 1990s). It also began usage of two different music packages from [[Edd Kalehoff]] (who had composed WNBC's \"We're 4 New York\" campaign and \"NBC Stations\" package that was in use at the time), one for the normal newscasts titled \"WCBS Grand\", which began alongside the debut of the 4 p.m. news, and another package especially intended for ''Nightcast''. It did not work, and Cheatwood was gone by 2002 in favor of New York veteran news director Dianne Doctor. The station became simply ''CBS 2'', and gradually phased out the tabloid elements, the Information Network, and ''Nightcast''. In its place, Doctor introduced a \"news for the people\" approach similar to that of her previous employer, WNBC. The Kalehoff-produced themes were replaced with the John Hegner-produced \"News in Focus\" which sister KCBS had used starting in 1997 (and had replaced just days before WCBS adopted the package). Several pieces of \"WCBS Grand\" have since been recycled by Kalehoff as music cues on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' under the title \"Grandeur.\" The graphics and logo mainly became blue and silver, with that color motif remaining to this day (albeit with the addition of gold) with successive graphics packages, including the last several which have been shared with most of the other stations in the CBS O&O group.\n\nAfter Doctor's arrival, WCBS placed a revived emphasis on hard news, while attempting to revive some elements of its glory days. For instance, in 2003 Arnold Diaz rejoined the station to revive \"Shame on You\", an [[Emmy Award]]-winning series of investigative segments. He had worked at the station from 1973 to 1995, leaving to serve a similar investigative role at [[ABC News]]. In December 2005, Diaz once again departed, this time leaving for WNYW. Another segment was \"Eat at Your Own Risk\", which highlighted unsafe conditions at New York-area restaurants. Ironically, the cafeteria at the CBS Broadcast Center was cited for violations by the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]].

Doctor was criticized for airing \"Shame on You\" and \"Eat at Your Own Risk\" segments ahead of major stories. She also came under fire when channel 2 led its 11 p.m. newscast of May 24, 2005, with a story and exclusive video of actor [[Burt Reynolds]] slapping a CBS producer, while rivals WABC-TV and WNBC-TV led with an important vote in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] on [[stem cell research]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOn May 27, 2004, Doctor fired popular sports anchor Warner Wolf, three months before his contract expired, without giving Wolf a chance to say goodbye on air. This incident was widely panned by several newspapers, including the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', and the move alienated and angered many viewers. Wolf was replaced by the much younger [[Chris Wragge]], who was brought in from NBC affiliate [[KPRC-TV]] in [[Houston]]. On June 1, 2005, Jim Rosenfield rejoined the station to anchor the 5 and 11 p.m. newscasts with [[Roz Abrams]], who joined channel 2 the previous year after an 18-year run at WABC-TV. The son of a former CBS executive, Rosenfield had worked at the station from 1998 to 2000 before moving to WNBC (to anchor ''[[Live at Five (WNBC TV series)|Live at Five]]'') after a contract dispute with channel 2. Rosenfield replaced [[Ernie Anastos]], who moved to WNYW in July 2005.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOn August 22, 2005, WCBS-TV launched its new [[Doppler weather radar]] named \"Live Doppler 2 Million\". It has one million watts of power, and is live, compared to other dopplers in the market which are delayed by about 15 minutes. \"Live Doppler 2 Million\" was the punch line of a joke on an episode of ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' and was ridiculed on the popular ''[[Opie and Anthony]]'' radio show. The station renamed the radar in 2006 to \"Live Doppler\". The station also uses the [[Volumetric Imaging and Processing of Integrated Radar|VIPIR]] radar processing software. Coincidentally, transportation reporter Arthur Chi'en was fired from the station three months earlier after mistakenly using expletives live on the air in response to someone from ''Opie and Anthony'' disrupting his live report as part of their \"Assault on the Media\" contest. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} On April 14, 2006, Dianne Doctor left WCBS-TV. The station decided to move its news department in a new direction under new general manager Peter Dunn, who axed \"Shame on You\" and \"Eat at Your Own Risk\". Doctor reportedly did not agree with the new plans, and opted to leave. The station has since overhauled its graphics and anchor lineup, winning praise from media observers.\n\n====Partnership with The Weather Channel; ratings improvement====\nIn early September 2006, WCBS-TV's weather department entered into a partnership with [[The Weather Channel]], with meteorologists from the [[cable channel]] often appearing on-air with existing WCBS-TV meteorologists. WCBS-TV also received information from The Weather Channel, in addition to using its radars and satellite imagery. The Weather Channel featured updates with WCBS for New York City's weather on its ''[[Evening Edition]]'' program with one of the WCBS meteorologists, and forecast intros on WCBS began with \"now time for your exclusive forecast from CBS 2 and The Weather Channel.\" On July 7, 2008, this partnership ended when it was announced that The Weather Channel had been sold to [[NBCUniversal]] (owner of competitor WNBC).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n====Personnel change====\nOn November 6, 2006, WCBS-TV made a personnel change on its noon and 5 p.m. newscasts. Former sports director and anchor Chris Wragge became co-anchor of both programs, along with newly hired Kristine Johnson; both replaced Roz Abrams and [[Mary Calvi]] on those newscasts; Abrams' contract was allowed to lapse, and Calvi was reassigned to weekends as the sole evening anchor. Calvi co-anchored on mornings with Rob Morrison. More changes came on December 25, 2006, as John Elliot was introduced as the new morning and noon meteorologist, replacing [[Audrey Puente]], whose abrupt breach-of-contract demotion led to her being allowed to become the new chief meteorologist at WWOR-TV less than two weeks later. WCBS-TV also hired [[Lonnie Quinn]], who had been a weatherman in Miami, as they phased out John Bolaris, who had rejoined WCBS in 2002. On June 25, 2007, Wragge and Johnson added the 11 p.m. newscast to their duties, trading places with [[Dana Tyler]] and Jim Rosenfield on the noon program; Tyler and Rosenfield continued to co-anchor the 6 p.m. newscast. Rosenfield left WCBS in May 2008 and was replaced with recently hired weekend anchor [[Don Dahler]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n====Improvement in ratings, new set====\nIn the February 2007 ratings period, WCBS-TV finished second behind WABC-TV from sign-on to sign-off \u2013 its best showing in 16 years, although most of its newscasts still finished in third place at that time. By the November 2007 sweeps period, channel 2's local evening newscasts had overtaken WNBC for second place (mainly due to declining ratings at WNBC). It was channel 2's best news performance in 12 years, but it still trailed WABC-TV by a fairly wide margin. On April 11, 2007, WCBS-TV became the third New York City television station to begin broadcasting its newscasts in [[High-definition television|high-definition]]. In May 2008, WCBS led WNBC by an even wider margin. However, its longtime #1 noon newscast's ratings fell behind WABC, the only other station to offer a noon newscast in the New York area. WCBS has been unable to regain the lead at noon since, although they were still second in New York City among the market's evening broadcasts at the time.\n\nWCBS elected to change the noon anchors again after approximately a year and put the noon broadcast in the hands of the morning news team; the then-current anchors were Maurice DuBois and Mary Calvi with John Elliott providing weather forecasts. DuBois has since switched to anchoring the weeknight 5 and 11 p.m. newscasts with Johnson (with Wragge moving to ''[[The Early Show]]''; he later returned to anchor WCBS's 6 p.m. weekday broadcast with Dana Tyler) and is now partnered with Calvi weekday mornings and at noon.\n\n====WCBS-TV today====\n[[File:7.18.12KathrynBrownByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|Reporter Kathryn Brown reporting on the [[Summer 2012 North American heat wave]] from the Times Square subway station on July 18, 2012.]]\nIn the February 2011 Nielsen sweeps period, WCBS-TV's 11 p.m. newscast unseated WABC-TV for first place in total households in that timeslot. WABC continued to lead in the key demographics at 11 p.m..

Its first broadcast featured [[list of mayors of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Jimmy Walker]], [[Kate Smith]], and [[George Gershwin]].<ref>[http://earlytelevision.org/pdf/cbs_1931_program.pdf Inaugural Broadcast Program]</ref> The station had the first regular seven-day broadcasting schedule in American television, broadcasting 28 hours a week. Among its early programming included ''[[The Television Ghost]]'' (1931\u20131933), ''[[Helen Haynes]]'' (1931\u20131932) and ''[[Piano Lessons (TV series)|Piano Lessons]]'' (1931\u20131932).\n\nAnnouncer-director Bill Schudt was the station's only paid employee; all other staff were volunteers. W2XAB pioneered program development including small-scale dramatic acts, monologues, pantomime, and the use of projection slides to simulate sets. Engineer Bill Lodge<ref name=\"II2000\">{{cite book|author=Lawrence H.

On November 8, 1932, W2XAB broadcast the first television coverage of presidential election returns. The station suspended operations on February 20, 1933, as monochrome television transmission standards were in flux, and in the process of changing from a mechanical to an all-electronic system. W2XAB returned with an all-electronic system in 1939 from a new studio complex in [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] and a transmitter located at the [[Chrysler Building]] broadcasting on channel 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/w2xab.html |title=W2XAB \u2013 CBS, New York |publisher=Earlytelevision.org |date= |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref> W2XAB transmitted the first color broadcast in the United States on August 28, 1940.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm |title=CBS Color Television System Chronology |publisher=Novia.net |accessdate=October 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922013759/http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm |archivedate=September 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 1941, W2XAB received a commercial [[Planning_permission#Broadcasting|construction permit]] and program authorization as '''WCBW'''. The station went on the air at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. on July 1, one hour after rival [[WNBC|WNBT]] (channel 1, formerly W2XBS), making it the second authorized fully commercial television station in the United States. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) issued permits to CBS and NBC at the same time and intended WNBT and WCBW to sign on simultaneously on July 1, so no one station could claim to be the \"first\". WCBW's initial broadcast was the first local newscast aired on a commercial station in the country. Its assigned frequency was 60\u201366&nbsp;MHz, now known as channel 3 but then referred to as Channel 2 in the 1940\u201346 alignment of the VHF band.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nProgram schedules were irregular through the summer and early fall of 1941. Regular daily operations began on October 29 and WCBW received a full [[Broadcast license]], its construction permit and commercial program authorization on March 10, 1942. After the war, the FCC re-allocated the television and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] bands. WCBW closed down its operation on the old channel 2 at the end of February 1946 (the 60\u201366&nbsp;MHz band had been re-allocated to [[KYW-TV|WPTZ]] in Philadelphia as channel 3) in order to move to a new channel 2 at 54\u201360&nbsp;MHz. It quickly began operation on the new frequency, where it remained from the spring of 1946 until the end of analog full power television service in the late spring of 2009.\n\nThe call letters were changed to '''WCBS-TV''' on November 1, 1946, after the FCC allowed television stations owned by radio stations in the same city to use the same call letters as the radio station with the suffix ''-TV''\u2014it is the only station in the CBS-owned station group to have been built from the ground up by the network.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Later analog years (1951\u20132008)===\n{{expand section|more information on the station from the 1950s to the present day|date=February 2011}}\nOn February 26, 1951, WCBS-TV became the first station to broadcast a regularly scheduled feature film series, ''The Late Show''. On August 11, 1951, WCBS-TV broadcast the first baseball game on [[color television]], between the [[1951 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[1951 Boston Braves season|Boston Braves]] from [[Ebbets Field]]. As were all color programs at the time, it was transmitted via a [[field-sequential color system]] developed by CBS. Signals transmitted this way could not be seen on existing black-and-white sets. The CBS color system was scrapped after the FCC embraced the alternative [[RCA]] all-electronic dot sequential system, which was fully compatible with the existing monochrome television standard, late in 1953. However, CBS telecast few programs in color, either locally or through the network, until the mid-1960s when color television sets became more affordable to the American public.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n[[File:WCBS-TV 2 logo.png|right|215px|thumb|Variant used by the station from 2013 to 2016; the logo was used from 1997 to 2016.]]\n\nIn May 1997, the station adopted the \"CBS 2\" branding, along with sister stations [[KCBS-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]] and [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]], while retaining a unique and distinctive logo.\n\nWCBS-TV's over-the air signal was not affected by the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] that destroyed the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]. Unlike its competitors, channel 2 had long maintained a full-powered backup transmitter at the Empire State Building after moving its main transmitter to the North Tower of the then-new World Trade Center in 1975. The station's coverage of the attacks was also [[simulcast]] nationally on [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] (which owned CBS at the time) cable network [[VH1]] that day. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, WCBS-TV was briefly the only full-coverage over-the-air television service operating in New York City, although the station lent transmission time to other stations who had lost their transmitters until they found suitable backup equipment and locations. The backup transmitter had been put into operation once before, when the [[World Trade Center bombing]] of February 26, 1993 knocked most of the area's stations off the air for a week.\n\n===Digital era===\nWCBS-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 2, at 2 p.m. on June 12, 2009, as part of the [[Digital television transition in the United States|federally mandated transition from analog to digital television]].<ref name=\"Analog to Digital\">[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf List of Digital Full-Power Stations]</ref> The station moved its digital signal from its pre-transition [[UHF]] channel 56, which was among the high band UHF channels (52\u201369) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to channel 33,<ref name=\"FCCForm387\">[http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?content=25&appn=101232921&formid=387&fac_num=9610 CDBS Print].

The games, produced by the new [[YES Network]], remained in the station until the [[2004 New York Yankees season|2004 season]]; the rights moved to [[UPN]] affiliate (now [[MyNetworkTV]] owned-and-operated station) [[WWOR-TV]] beginning in [[2005 New York Yankees season|2005]]. It also aired any Yankee or [[New York Mets|Met]] games as part of CBS' MLB broadcast contract from 1990 to 1993.\n\nFrom [[1956 NFL season|1956]] until [[1993 NFL season|1993]], WCBS-TV carried most [[New York Giants]] games through [[NFL on CBS|the network's coverage]] of the [[National Football League]]. CBS lost the rights to the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) to [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox]] in [[1994 NFL season|1994]], resulting in Giants games moving to WNYW; currently, Giants preseason games are carried by [[NBC]] owned-and-operated station WNBC (with WWOR-TV being served as an overflow station if the [[Olympics on NBC|Summer Olympics]] conflicts the preseason schedule). After a 5-year absence, the NFL returned to CBS and WCBS-TV in 1998 through a package of [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) games; the station currently airs [[New York Jets]] preseason games and most regular season games, along with occasional Giants games, usually when the team plays host to an AFC opponent at [[MetLife Stadium]] (or, since 2014, through the 'cross-flex' broadcast rules, any Giants games where they play another NFC team that are moved from Fox to CBS). The station also aired occasional Jets games when they played at home to an NFC team from 1970 to 1993. During the regular season, some Jets games are rotated with WNBC (through ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]''), WNYW (through ''[[NFL on Fox]]'' and ''[[Thursday Night Football]]''), [[WABC-TV]] (through ''[[Monday Night Football]]''), [[WPIX]] (through ''Monday Night Football'', if WABC-TV is not airing them) and select TNF telecasts not carried by Fox's package it shares with NFL Network), and in rare cases, WWOR-TV (through ''Monday Night Football''). The station has aired the Giants' victory in [[Super Bowl XXI]] and loss in [[Super Bowl XXXV]].\n\nIn 1980, WCBS-TV aired Game 6 of the [[1980 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] via an episode of ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular]]'', where the [[New York Islanders]] won their first of four straight [[Stanley Cup]]s.\n\n===News operation===\nWCBS-TV presently broadcasts 33 hours, 5 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5 hours, 5 minutes each weekday; 3 hours, 5 minutes on Saturdays and 4 hours, 35 minutes on Sundays). Like other CBS-owned stations, WCBS-TV offers a web only newscast called \"CBS 2 at Your Desk\", available weekdays at 9 a.m. Also, available are streamlined editions of the noon, 5 and 6, and the 11 p.m. newscasts. There is also a \"LoHud Report\" edition of \"At Your Desk\", operated by WCBS-TV and LoHud.com, the website for ''[[The Journal News]]'', a [[Gannett|Gannett Company]]-owned newspaper covering the lower [[Hudson Valley]]. ''The Journal News'' has a partnership with the station where WCBS-TV uses the newspaper's offices for its Westchester Bureau, and ''The Journal News'' gets a 30-second promotion during the 6 p.m. newscast for the next day's top story.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nWCBS-TV cooperates with sister station KYW-TV in Philadelphia in the production and broadcast of statewide [[New Jersey]] political debates. When the two stations broadcast a statewide office debate, such as for [[Governor of New Jersey|Governor]] or [[United States Senate]], they will pool resources and have anchors or reporters from both stations participate in the debate. Additionally, the two stations cooperate in the gathering of news in New Jersey where their markets overlap; sharing reporters, live trucks and helicopters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n====History====\nUpon becoming commercial station WCBW in 1941, the station broadcast two daily news programs, at 2:30 and 7:30&nbsp;p.m. weekdays, anchored by Richard Hubbell.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.poynter.org/archive/2006/early-tv-anchors/ |title=Early TV Anchors |work=poynter.org |accessdate=May 19, 2019}}</ref> Most of the newscasts featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph. When Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941, WCBW (which was usually off the air on Sunday to give the engineers a day off), took to the air at 8:45&nbsp;p.m. that Sunday with an extensive special report. The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to the Grand Central Station studios during the evening and give information and commentary on the attack. The WCBW special report that night lasted less than 90 minutes. But that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC, the unscheduled live news broadcast on December 7 \u201cwas unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time.\u201d Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war. In May 1942, WCBW (like almost all television stations) sharply cut back its live program schedule and the newscasts were cancelled, since the station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily due to the fact that much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war-related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the wartime lack of parts.\n\nIn May 1944, as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened the studios and the newscasts returned, briefly anchored by [[Ned Calmer]], and then by Everett Holles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/pub/libs/images/usr/7533_h.jpg |title=Black and white television studio photograph |publisher=Newsinfo.iu.edu |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref> After the war, expanded news programs appeared on the WCBW schedule\u2014renamed WCBS-TV in 1946\u2014first anchored by Milo Boulton and later by [[Douglas Edwards]]. On May 3, 1948, Douglas Edwards began anchoring ''CBS Television News'', a regular 15-minute nightly newscast on the rudimentary CBS network, including WCBS-TV. It aired every weeknight at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. and was the first regularly scheduled network television news program featuring an anchor. The NBC television network's offering at the time ''NBC Television Newsreel'' (premiering in February 1948) was simply film with voice narration. In 1950, the name of the nightly news was changed to ''Douglas Edwards with the News'', and the following year, it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts, thanks to a new coaxial cable connection, prompting Edwards to use the greeting \"Good evening everyone, coast to coast.\" The broadcast was renamed the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' when [[Walter Cronkite]] replaced Edwards in 1962.<ref>\"The Origins Of Television News In America\" by Mike Conway. Chapter: \"The Birth of CBS-TV News: Columbia's Ambitious Experiment at the Advent of U.S. Commercial Television\". (Peter Lang Publishing, New York NY).</ref> Edwards remained with CBS News with various daytime television newscasts and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April 1, 1988.\n\nIn the 1950s through the mid-1960s, WCBS-TV's local newscasts were anchored by CBS News correspondents [[Robert Trout]] (at 7 p.m.) and by [[Don Hollenbeck]] and later Douglas Edwards (at 11 p.m.). Beginning in 1965, production of local news broadcasts on WCBS-TV and other CBS-owned television stations, which had been previously produced by CBS News, were taken over by the local stations. Trout and Edwards were succeeded by [[Jim Jensen (reporter)|Jim Jensen]]. Jensen had only come to WCBS-TV a year earlier (he had been at [[WBZ-TV]] in Boston), but was already well known for his coverage of [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s 1964 campaign for the United States Senate. During the 1960s, WCBS-TV battled WNBC-TV (channel 4) for the top-rated news department in New York City. After WABC-TV (channel 7) introduced ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' in the late 1960s, WCBS-TV went back and forth in first place with Channel 7, in a rivalry that continued through the 1970s. For much of the early 1980s, New York's \"Big Three\" stations took turns in the top spot. During this time, three of the longest-tenured anchor teams in New York \u2013 Jensen and [[Rolland Smith]], WABC-TV's [[Roger Grimsby]] and [[Bill Beutel]], and WNBC-TV's [[Chuck Scarborough]] and [[Sue Simmons]] \u2013 went head-to-head with each other. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nWCBS-TV had many well-known personalities during this era: anchors [[Dave Marash]], Rolland Smith, [[Michele Marsh (reporter)|Michele Marsh]] and Vic Miles; [[meteorologist]]s [[Frank Field (meteorologist)|Dr. Frank Field]] and [[John Coleman (meteorologist)|John Coleman]]; reporters [[Meredith Vieira]], [[Randall Pinkston]], [[Tony Guida]], [[John Stossel]] and [[Arnold D\u00edaz]] and sportscaster [[Warner Wolf]]. Vieira, Pinkston and Guida later moved to the CBS network. Vieira later moved to NBC where she co-hosted the morning show ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]'' until leaving in 2011 and being replaced with [[Ann Curry]].\n\nIn 1987, WABC-TV surged to first place. As the 1990s began, Channel 2 found itself increasingly losing its ratings share to WNBC. One of management's more controversial responses was to take Jensen off the anchor desk in late 1994 and demote him to host of a Sunday morning [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public-affairs]] show, ''Sunday Edition''. He also hosted a few episodes of the regular \"Sports Update\" show on Sunday nights at 11:30&nbsp;p.m. At the time, Jensen had served as an anchor longer than anyone in New York television history (he has since been passed by WABC-TV's Beutel and WNBC's Scarborough). The move was roundly criticized by many in New York, especially since WCBS-TV had supported him after he went into [[drug rehabilitation]] in 1988. Another controversy involved an exchange between Jensen and co-anchor [[Bree Walker]], whose fingers and toes are fused together as a result of the condition [[ectrodactyly]]. After Walker did a report about her experience with the condition, Jensen asked Walker, on the air, if her parents would have aborted her had they known she would have been born with the condition. Walker kept her composure on air but soon left the station.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-_UR93_9Ro |title=Anchor Jim Jensen Gets Too Personal With Bree Walker |publisher=YouTube |date=August 2, 2008 |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe incident took place shortly before Jensen's entry to drug rehabilitation. Station management came under more fire in 1995 when Jensen was forced to retire shortly after the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] announced it was buying CBS. By the end of 1995, Channel 2 had crashed into last place for the first time in its history while WNBC surged to a strong second place \u2013 a pecking order that would remain in place for eleven years. The station's news branding change from ''Channel 2 News'' to just ''2 News'' during that time contributed to the station's last-place finish in the February 1996 sweeps period.\n\n====1996 \"massacre\": Mass firings and format changes====\n[[Image:WCBS-TV news 90s.png|140px|thumb|right|WCBS-TV's news logo from 1997 to 2000]]\nOn October 2, 1996, the station executed an unprecedented mass firing without any advance warning, citing the need to shake up its news operation. Seven people were fired: anchors [[John Johnson (reporter)|John Johnson]], Michele Marsh and Tony Guida; sports anchor Bernie Smilovitz (who promptly returned to his previous station, [[WDIV]] in Detroit); and reporters Reggie Harris, Roseanne Colletti and Magee Hickey.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news | title = At WCBS-TV, a Big Round Of News Staff Dismissals | first = Richard | last = Sandomir | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E3D7143FF930A35753C1A960958260 | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = October 3, 1996 | accessdate = September 13, 2009}}</ref> The firings came after the 6 p.m. newscast. Johnson and Marsh had anchored the 5 p.m. newscasts and signed off at 6 p.m. saying, \"We'll see you at 11,\" but never got a chance to say goodbye on the air.\n\nThe \"massacre,\" as it has come to be known, was part of a move enacted by then-news director Bill Carey to boost ratings, although it came at a time when CBS was under pressure to boost revenues, having just merged with Westinghouse. It was also part of a major reconstruction of the newscast, culminating in the May 1997 rebranding to ''News 2''; 2 months prior, Warner Wolf had returned to the station, having left in 1992 for [[WUSA-TV]], the CBS affiliate in Washington.\n\nWhen the ''News 2'' name was put in place, a format change was also instituted, going for a faster-paced newscast with more stories; this was reinforced by reminders that ''News 2'' had \"More news in less time, everytime\" and a \"Rundown\" of stories to come. After a year, little to no progress in the ratings was made, so this format was done away with; a new \"Virtual studio\" format, alongside bright, orange and white graphics and a \"club\" remix of WBBM-TV's \"I Love Chicago, Chicago My Home\" theme (which the station has used in various forms for all but a few years since 1982) was tried out. This did not work either, so this approach was junked, in favor of a more \"traditional\" newscast. The \"club\" remix of the WBBM theme would continue to be used until early 2000.\n\n====CBS 2 News====\n[[Image:Cbs2hdlogo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|\"CBS 2 News\" nighttime open from September 22, 2013 to April 21, 2016. On April 22, 2016, the logo was changed to a new numeric \"2\" for the first time since 1997, in the same font used by [[WBBM-TV]] and [[KCBS-TV]], also used since 1997.]]\nIn 2000, [[Joel Cheatwood]], creator of the ''7 News'' format at [[WSVN]] in [[Miami]], was appointed as the station's news director. At his suggestion, the newscasts were rebranded from ''News 2'' to ''the CBS 2 Information Network,'' using \"content partners\" such as ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' and VH1. He also gave the newscasts more of a [[tabloid television|tabloid]] feel. While considerably watered down compared to Bill Applegate's work at WBBM-TV in Chicago, John Lippmann's work at KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] flagship WNYW, and Cheatwood's work at WSVN \u2013 and even compared to WSVN's sister station, [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] in [[Boston]]\u2014it was much flashier than had been seen on New York's \"Big Three\" affiliates. He also retooled the 11 p.m. report as a \"gritty, down-to-earth\" style newscast, termed ''Nightcast''. At this point, the station was sharing studio space with [[CBS Sports]] (having shared street-side studios with CBS' then-morning newscast, ''[[The Early Show]]'', as a part of its short-lived attempt at a newscast at 4 p.m., which they had attempted in the early 1990s). It also began usage of two different music packages from [[Edd Kalehoff]] (who had composed WNBC's \"We're 4 New York\" campaign and \"NBC Stations\" package that was in use at the time), one for the normal newscasts titled \"WCBS Grand\", which began alongside the debut of the 4 p.m. news, and another package especially intended for ''Nightcast''. It did not work, and Cheatwood was gone by 2002 in favor of New York veteran news director Dianne Doctor. The station became simply ''CBS 2'', and gradually phased out the tabloid elements, the Information Network, and ''Nightcast''. In its place, Doctor introduced a \"news for the people\" approach similar to that of her previous employer, WNBC. The Kalehoff-produced themes were replaced with the John Hegner-produced \"News in Focus\" which sister KCBS had used starting in 1997 (and had replaced just days before WCBS adopted the package). Several pieces of \"WCBS Grand\" have since been recycled by Kalehoff as music cues on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' under the title \"Grandeur.\" The graphics and logo mainly became blue and silver, with that color motif remaining to this day (albeit with the addition of gold) with successive graphics packages, including the last several which have been shared with most of the other stations in the CBS O&O group.\n\nAfter Doctor's arrival, WCBS placed a revived emphasis on hard news, while attempting to revive some elements of its glory days. For instance, in 2003 Arnold Diaz rejoined the station to revive \"Shame on You\", an [[Emmy Award]]-winning series of investigative segments. He had worked at the station from 1973 to 1995, leaving to serve a similar investigative role at [[ABC News]]. In December 2005, Diaz once again departed, this time leaving for WNYW. Another segment was \"Eat at Your Own Risk\", which highlighted unsafe conditions at New York-area restaurants. Ironically, the cafeteria at the CBS Broadcast Center was cited for violations by the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]]. Violations included the presence of rats and roaches, as well as food temperature issues.<ref name=\"nycdotgov\">[http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/rii/index.shtml Restaurant Inspection Information: NYC DOHMH] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210175708/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/rii/index.shtml |date=December 10, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nDespite this and other attempts at fixes, the ratings did not significantly improve under Doctor's watch. Doctor was criticized for airing \"Shame on You\" and \"Eat at Your Own Risk\" segments ahead of major stories. She also came under fire when channel 2 led its 11 p.m. newscast of May 24, 2005, with a story and exclusive video of actor [[Burt Reynolds]] slapping a CBS producer, while rivals WABC-TV and WNBC-TV led with an important vote in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] on [[stem cell research]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOn May 27, 2004, Doctor fired popular sports anchor Warner Wolf, three months before his contract expired, without giving Wolf a chance to say goodbye on air. This incident was widely panned by several newspapers, including the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', and the move alienated and angered many viewers. Wolf was replaced by the much younger [[Chris Wragge]], who was brought in from NBC affiliate [[KPRC-TV]] in [[Houston]]. On June 1, 2005, Jim Rosenfield rejoined the station to anchor the 5 and 11 p.m. newscasts with [[Roz Abrams]], who joined channel 2 the previous year after an 18-year run at WABC-TV. The son of a former CBS executive, Rosenfield had worked at the station from 1998 to 2000 before moving to WNBC (to anchor ''[[Live at Five (WNBC TV series)|Live at Five]]'') after a contract dispute with channel 2. Rosenfield replaced [[Ernie Anastos]], who moved to WNYW in July 2005.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOn August 22, 2005, WCBS-TV launched its new [[Doppler weather radar]] named \"Live Doppler 2 Million\". It has one million watts of power, and is live, compared to other dopplers in the market which are delayed by about 15 minutes. \"Live Doppler 2 Million\" was the punch line of a joke on an episode of ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' and was ridiculed on the popular ''[[Opie and Anthony]]'' radio show. The station renamed the radar in 2006 to \"Live Doppler\". The station also uses the [[Volumetric Imaging and Processing of Integrated Radar|VIPIR]] radar processing software. Coincidentally, transportation reporter Arthur Chi'en was fired from the station three months earlier after mistakenly using expletives live on the air in response to someone from ''Opie and Anthony'' disrupting his live report as part of their \"Assault on the Media\" contest. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} On April 14, 2006, Dianne Doctor left WCBS-TV. The station decided to move its news department in a new direction under new general manager Peter Dunn, who axed \"Shame on You\" and \"Eat at Your Own Risk\". Doctor reportedly did not agree with the new plans, and opted to leave. The station has since overhauled its graphics and anchor lineup, winning praise from media observers.\n\n====Partnership with The Weather Channel; ratings improvement====\nIn early September 2006, WCBS-TV's weather department entered into a partnership with [[The Weather Channel]], with meteorologists from the [[cable channel]] often appearing on-air with existing WCBS-TV meteorologists. WCBS-TV also received information from The Weather Channel, in addition to using its radars and satellite imagery. The Weather Channel featured updates with WCBS for New York City's weather on its ''[[Evening Edition]]'' program with one of the WCBS meteorologists, and forecast intros on WCBS began with \"now time for your exclusive forecast from CBS 2 and The Weather Channel.\" On July 7, 2008, this partnership ended when it was announced that The Weather Channel had been sold to [[NBCUniversal]] (owner of competitor WNBC).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n====Personnel change====\nOn November 6, 2006, WCBS-TV made a personnel change on its noon and 5 p.m. newscasts. Former sports director and anchor Chris Wragge became co-anchor of both programs, along with newly hired Kristine Johnson; both replaced Roz Abrams and [[Mary Calvi]] on those newscasts; Abrams' contract was allowed to lapse, and Calvi was reassigned to weekends as the sole evening anchor. Calvi co-anchored on mornings with Rob Morrison. More changes came on December 25, 2006, as John Elliot was introduced as the new morning and noon meteorologist, replacing [[Audrey Puente]], whose abrupt breach-of-contract demotion led to her being allowed to become the new chief meteorologist at WWOR-TV less than two weeks later. WCBS-TV also hired [[Lonnie Quinn]], who had been a weatherman in Miami, as they phased out John Bolaris, who had rejoined WCBS in 2002. On June 25, 2007, Wragge and Johnson added the 11 p.m. newscast to their duties, trading places with [[Dana Tyler]] and Jim Rosenfield on the noon program; Tyler and Rosenfield continued to co-anchor the 6 p.m. newscast. Rosenfield left WCBS in May 2008 and was replaced with recently hired weekend anchor [[Don Dahler]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n====Improvement in ratings, new set====\nIn the February 2007 ratings period, WCBS-TV finished second behind WABC-TV from sign-on to sign-off \u2013 its best showing in 16 years, although most of its newscasts still finished in third place at that time. By the November 2007 sweeps period, channel 2's local evening newscasts had overtaken WNBC for second place (mainly due to declining ratings at WNBC). It was channel 2's best news performance in 12 years, but it still trailed WABC-TV by a fairly wide margin. On April 11, 2007, WCBS-TV became the third New York City television station to begin broadcasting its newscasts in [[High-definition television|high-definition]]. In May 2008, WCBS led WNBC by an even wider margin. However, its longtime #1 noon newscast's ratings fell behind WABC, the only other station to offer a noon newscast in the New York area. WCBS has been unable to regain the lead at noon since, although they were still second in New York City among the market's evening broadcasts at the time.\n\nWCBS elected to change the noon anchors again after approximately a year and put the noon broadcast in the hands of the morning news team; the then-current anchors were Maurice DuBois and Mary Calvi with John Elliott providing weather forecasts. DuBois has since switched to anchoring the weeknight 5 and 11 p.m. newscasts with Johnson (with Wragge moving to ''[[The Early Show]]''; he later returned to anchor WCBS's 6 p.m. weekday broadcast with Dana Tyler) and is now partnered with Calvi weekday mornings and at noon.\n\n====WCBS-TV today====\n[[File:7.18.12KathrynBrownByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|Reporter Kathryn Brown reporting on the [[Summer 2012 North American heat wave]] from the Times Square subway station on July 18, 2012.]]\nIn the February 2011 Nielsen sweeps period, WCBS-TV's 11 p.m. newscast unseated WABC-TV for first place in total households in that timeslot. WABC continued to lead in the key demographics at 11 p.m.. WCBS-TV quickly lost its lead at 11 p.m. after WABC-TV regained its status as #1 at 11 p.m. in the May 2011 sweeps.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/its-a-clean-sweep-of-the-november-sweeps-for-wabcchannel-7/ |title=It\u2019s a Clean Sweep of the November Sweeps for WABC/Channel 7 \u2013 FishbowlNY |publisher=Mediabistro.com |date=November 28, 2011 |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref> WABC-TV has since kept its #1 status at 11 p.m. Recently, WCBS-TV has moved back to third place in ratings due to an increase in ratings at WNBC.\n\nOn March 12 and 13, 2020, WCBS-TV's evening newscasts were produced by Los Angeles sister station [[KCBS-TV]], and its morning newscasts originated from [[KPIX-TV]] in San Francisco, after the CBS Broadcast Center was closed for disinfection due to two employees tested positive for [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19 novel coronavirus]], with weathercasts being originated from the weather department's mobile broadcast unit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/11/cbs-closes-nyc-offices-after-two-employees-positive-for-coronavirus/|title=CBS closes NYC offices after two employees positive for coronavirus|last=Barone|first=Vincent|date=2020-03-11|website=New York Post|language=en|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscaststudio.com/2020/03/12/wcbs-kcbs/?og=1|title=CBS New York turns local news over to Los Angeles as studios remain closed|website=NewscastStudio|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref> Newscasts resumed from the Broadcast Center that weekend;<ref name=\"tvs-wcbsbcback\">{{cite news |last1=Tsoflias Siegel |first1=Stephanie |title=Some WCBS Staffers Back After Coronavirus-Related Studio Closure |url=https://www.adweek.com/tvspy/chris-wragge-appears-on-wcbs-sunday-morning-show-after-coronavirus-related-studio-closure/219876/ |accessdate=March 18, 2020 |work=TVSpy |date=March 15, 2020}}</ref> however, on March 18, the Broadcast Center was again shut down and production was transferred back to KCBS-TV.<ref name=\"tvs-wcbsbacktokcbs\">{{cite news |last1=Ariens |first1=Chris |title=KCBS Anchors Will Again Fill in on WCBS With Coronavirus Concerns Not Yet Contained |url=https://www.adweek.com/tvspy/kcbs-anchors-will-again-fill-in-on-wcbs-with-coronavirus-concerns-not-yet-contained/220062/ |accessdate=March 18, 2020 |work=TVSpy |date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> On March 20, WCBS-TV began to originate newscasts with their regular talent from the [[Stanford, Connecticut]] studios of the [[YES Network]], which were otherwise dark due to the suspension of [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|most sports due to the pandemic]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/cbs-owned-stations-pitch-in-with-national-newscasts|title=CBS\u2019 Owned Stations Pitch In with National Newscasts|last=Malone|first=Michael|date=20 March 2020|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|accessdate=21 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===On-air staff===\n====Notable current on-air staff====\n* [[Tony Aiello]] \u2013 general assignment reporter\n* [[Dick Brennan (journalist)|Dick Brennan]] \u2013 general assignment reporter and fill-in anchor\n* [[Mary Calvi]] \u2013 anchor\n* [[Alexis Christoforous]] \u2013 business reporter\n* [[Maurice DuBois]] \u2013 anchor\n* [[Alice Gainer]] \u2013 general assignment reporter and fill-in anchor\n* Dr. [[Max Gomez]] \u2013 medical reporter\n* [[Carolyn Gusoff]] \u2013 Long Island reporter\n* [[Cindy Hsu]] \u2013 anchor and fill in anchor\n* [[Kristine Johnson]] \u2013 anchor\n* [[Marcia Kramer]] \u2013 chief political reporter\n* [[Otis Livingston]] \u2013 sports anchor\n* [[Jennifer McLogan]] \u2013 Long Island correspondent\n* [[Jessica Moore (journalist)|Jessica Moore]] \u2013 anchor and general assignment reporter\n* [[Lonnie Quinn]] \u2013 chief weathercaster\n* [[Dana Tyler]] \u2013 anchor;

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.

Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.
