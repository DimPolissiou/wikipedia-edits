He reached [[Naples]] in 1629, where he probably studied under [[Jusepe de Ribera]] (according to [[Bernardo De Dominici]]), but according to other documents he frequently attended the studio of a certain Pietro Beato, marrying Beato's niece Angela Formichella in 1636. De Dominici saw his style as almost identical with that of Ribera, but modern critics find his style so different from Ribera's that it is thought to be close to that of [[Massimo Stanzione]] and [[Agostino Beltrano]], whom he probably also studied under during his time with Beato. He died in Naples.\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Bartolomeopassante - adoracao01.jpg|thumb|''The Adoration of the Shepherds'' by Passante, Prado]]\nThere are two signed works by Passante - ''The Adoration of the Shepherds'' at the Prado and a ''Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine'' in a private collection in Naples.\n\n''Saint Sebastian Tended by Pious Women'' (London), ''Holy Family with Saint Joseph Sleeping'' (private collection, Causa), a large ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' (in a Swedish church - perhaps the painting cited by De Dominici as being in the church of [[San Giacomo degli Spagnoli, Naples|San Giacomo degli Spagnoli]] in Naples according to Giuliano Briganti), a ''Saint Catherine of Alexandria'' ([[Palazzo Madama, Turin|Palazzo Madama]], Turin<ref name=\"palazzomadamatorino\">{{cite web|url=http://www.palazzomadamatorino.it/pagina3.php?id_pagina=148|title=Homepage &#124; Palazzo Madama|publisher=palazzomadamatorino.it|accessdate=2015-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630145151/http://www.palazzomadamatorino.it/pagina3.php?id_pagina=148|archive-date=2013-06-30|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>) and a ''Triumph'' (private collection in Rome) are all also attributed to him for stylistic reasons.\n\nSpinosa<ref>Nicola Spinosa, ''Bartolomeo Bassante. Santa Caterina d'Alessandria'', in ''Civilt\u00e0 del Seicento a Napoli'', exhibition catalogue, Napoli 1984, scheda n. 2.5, p. 189</ref> argued that Passante is to be identified with the [[Master of the Annunciation to the Shepherds]] - the latter was active in Naples in the mid 17th century. This is no longer held to be plausible given Passante's short lifespan and was based on an assumption that he survived until the mid 17th century, now disproved by a document dating his death to 1648.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category}}\n\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Bernardo De Dominici]], ''Vite dei Pittori, Scultori, ed Architetti Napolitani'' (3 volumes), Stamperia del Ricciardi, Napoli 1742\n*Raffaello Causa, ''La pittura del Seicento a Napoli dal naturalismo al barocco'', in ''Storia di Napoli'', Napoli 1972, pp.&nbsp;974;\n*Nicola Spinosa, ''Bartolomeo Bassante.
