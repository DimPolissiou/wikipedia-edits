The gorge splits the Himalayas into Western and Eastern sections both ecologically and orographically \u2013 the pass at the head of the Kali Gandaki the [[Kora La]] is the lowest point on the ridgeline between Everest and [[K2]] (the highest peak of the Karakoram range and of Pakistan). To the east of Annapurna are the {{convert|8000|m|mile|abbr=on}} peaks of [[Manaslu]] and across the border in Tibet, [[Shishapangma]]. To the south of these lies [[Kathmandu]], the capital of Nepal and the largest city in the Himalayas. East of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] lies valley of the Bhote/[[Sun Kosi]] river which rises in Tibet and provides the main overland route between Nepal and China \u2013 the [[Araniko Highway]]/[[China National Highway 318]]. Further east is the [[Mahalangur Himal]] with four of the world's six highest mountains, including the highest: [[Cho Oyu]], [[Everest]], [[Lhotse]] and [[Makalu]]. The [[Khumbu]] region, popular for trekking, is found here on the south-western approaches to Everest. The [[Arun River, China-Nepal|Arun river]] drains the northern slopes of these mountains, before turning south and flowing to the range to the east of Makalu.\n\nIn the far east of Nepal, the Himalayas rise to the [[Kanchenjunga]] massif on the border with India, the third highest mountain in the world, the most easterly {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on}} summit and the highest point of India. The eastern side of Kanchenjunga is in the Indian state of [[Sikkim]]. Formerly an independent Kingdom, it lies on the main route from India to [[Lhasa]], Tibet, which passes over the [[Nathu La]] pass into the Tibet. East of Sikkim lies the ancient Buddhist Kingdom of [[Bhutan]]. The highest mountain in Bhutan is [[Gangkhar Puensum]], which is also a strong candidate for the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The Himalayas here are becoming increasingly rugged with heavily forested steep valleys. The Himalayas continue, turning slightly northeast, through the Indian State of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] as well as Tibet, before reaching their easterly conclusion in the peak of [[Namche Barwa]], situated in Tibet inside the great bend of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Yarlang Tsangpo]] river. On the other side of the Tsangpo, to the east, are the [[Kangri Garpo]] mountains. The high mountains to the north of the Tsangpo including [[Gyala Peri]], however, are also sometimes also included in the Himalayas.\n\nGoing west from Dhaulagiri, Western Nepal is somewhat remote and lacks major high mountains, but is home to [[Rara Lake]], the largest lake in Nepal. The [[Karnali River]] rises in Tibet but cuts through the center of the region. Further west, the border with [[India]] follows the [[Sarda River]] and provides a trade route into China, where on the Tibetan plateau lies the high peak of [[Gurla Mandhata]]. Just across [[Lake Manasarovar]] from this lies the sacred [[Mount Kailash]], which stands close to the source of the four main rivers of Himalayas and is revered in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Jainism, and Bonpo. In the newly created Indian state of [[Uttarkhand]], the Himalayas rise again as the Kumaon Himalayas with the high peaks of [[Nanda Devi]] and [[Kamet]]. The state is also an important pilgrimage destination, with the source of the Ganges at [[Gangotri]] and the Yamuna at [[Yamunotri]], and the temples at [[Badrinath]] and [[Kedarnath]].\n\nThe next Himalayan Indian state, [[Himachal Pradesh]], it is noted for its hill stations, particularly [[Shimla]], the summer capital of the [[British Raj]], and [[Dharmasala]], the centre of the Tibetan community in exile in India. This area marks the start of the Punjab Himalaya and the [[Sutlej river]], the most easterly of the five tributaries of the [[Indus]], cuts through the range here. Further west, the Himalayas form most of the southern portion of the Indian administered Union territories of [[Jammu & Kashmir]] and [[Ladakh]]. The twin peaks of [[Nun Kun]] are the only mountains over {{convert|7000|m|mile|abbr=on}} in this part of the Himalayas. Beyond lies the renown [[Kashmir Valley]] and the town and lakes of [[Srinagar]]. Finally, the Himalayas reach their western end in the dramatic 8000&nbsp;m peak of [[Nanga Parbat]], which rises over {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the Indus valley and is the most westerly of the 8000&nbsp;m summits. The western end terminates at a magnificent point near Nanga Parbat (killer mountain ) where Karakoram, Himalayas and Hindu Kush ranges intersects. It's situated in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\n\n==Geology==\n{{Main|Geology of the Himalaya}}\n[[File:Himalaya-formation.gif|thumb|upright|The {{convert|6000|km||adj=mid|-plus}} journey of the India landmass (Indian Plate) before its collision with Asia (Eurasian Plate) about 40 to 50 million [[Before Present|years ago]]<ref name=USGS/>]]\n\nThe Himalayan range is one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consists mostly of uplifted [[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock]]. According to the modern theory of [[plate tectonics]], its formation is a result of a [[continental collision]] or [[orogeny]] along the [[convergent boundary]] between the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The [[Arakan Yoma]] highlands in [[Burma|Myanmar]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] were also formed as a result of this collision.\n\nDuring the [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 70 million years ago, the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate (which has subsequently broken into the [[Indian Plate]] and the [[Australian Plate]]<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/95/18688.html (1995) Geologists Find: An Earth Plate Is Breaking in Two]</ref>) was moving at about {{cvt|15|cm|||}} per year. About 50 million years ago this fast moving Indo-Australian Plate had completely closed the [[Tethys Ocean]], the existence of which has been determined by [[sedimentary rock]]s settled on the ocean floor and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since both plates were composed of low density [[continental crust]], they were [[thrust fault]]ed and [[Fold (geology)|folded]] into mountain ranges rather than subducting into the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] along an [[oceanic trench]].<ref name=USGS/> An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine [[limestone]] from this ancient ocean.<ref>[https://www.thoughtco.com/mount-everest-overview-1435553 Mount Everest \u2013 Overview and Information] by Matt Rosenberg. ThoughtCo Updated 17 March 2017</ref>\n\nToday, the Indian plate continues to be driven horizontally at the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to continue to move upwards.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Plate-Tectonics/Chap3-Plate-Margins/Convergent/Continental-Collision|title=Plate Tectonics -The Himalayas |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=The Geological Society |access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref> The Indian plate is still moving at 67&nbsp;mm per year, and over the next 10 million years it will travel about {{cvt|1500|km|||}} into Asia. About 20&nbsp;mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by [[Thrust fault|thrusting]] along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5&nbsp;mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region [[seismic]]ally active, leading to earthquakes from time to time.\n\nDuring the last [[ice age]], there was a connected ice stream of [[glacier]]s between [[Kangchenjunga]] in the east and [[Nanga Parbat]] in the west.<ref name=Kuhle2011/><ref>glacier maps [http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780444534477/ downloadable]</ref> In the west, the glaciers joined with the ice stream network in the [[Karakoram]], and in the north, they joined with the former Tibetan inland ice.

As a result, the main ridge of the Himalayas is not clearly defined, and mountain passes are not as significant for traversing the range as with other mountain ranges. The rivers of the Himalayas drain into two large river systems:\n* The western rivers combine into the ''Indus Basin''. The [[Indus River|Indus]] itself forms the northern and western boundaries of the Himalayas. It begins in Tibet at the confluence of Sengge and Gar rivers and flows north-west through India into Pakistan before turning south-west to the [[Arabian Sea]]. It is fed by several major tributaries draining the southern slopes of the Himalayas, including the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], [[Chenab River|Chenab]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Beas River|Beas]] and [[Sutlej]] rivers, the five rivers of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].\n* The other Himalayan rivers drain the ''Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin''. Its main rivers are the [[Ganges]], the [[Brahmaputra]] and the [[Yamuna]], as well as other tributaries. The Brahmaputra originates as the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River (Tibet)|Yarlung Tsangpo River]] in western Tibet, and flows east through Tibet and west through the plains of [[Assam]]. The Ganges and the Brahmaputra meet in [[Bangladesh]] and drain into the [[Bay of Bengal]] through the world's largest river delta, the [[Sunderbans]].<ref name=gits4u/>\n\nThe northern slopes of [[Gyala Peri]] and the peaks beyond the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Tsangpo]], sometimes included in the Himalayas, drain into the [[Irrawaddy River]], which originates in eastern Tibet and flows south through Myanmar to drain into the [[Andaman Sea]]. The [[Salween]], [[Mekong]], [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]] all originate from parts of the Tibetan Plateau that are geologically distinct from the Himalaya mountains and are therefore not considered true Himalayan rivers.

For much of Himalayas \u2013 that on the south side of the high mountains, except in the furthest west, the most characteristic feature of the climate is the [[monsoon]]. Heavy rain arrives on the south-west monsoon in June and persists until September. The monsoon can seriously impact transport and cause major landslides. It restricts tourism \u2013 the trekking and mountaineering season is limited to either before the monsoon in April/May or after the monsoon in October/November (autumn). In Nepal and Sikkim, there are often considered to be five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]], autumn, (or post-monsoon), winter and spring.\n\nUsing the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], the lower elevations of the Himalayas, reaching in mid elevations in central Nepal (including the Kathmandu valley), are classified as ''Cwa'', [[humid subtropical climate#South Asia|Humid subtropical climate]] with dry winters. Higher up, most of the Himalayas have a [[Oceanic climate#Subtropical highland variety|subtropical highland climate (''Cwb'')]].\n\nIn the furthest west of the Himalayas, in the west of the Kashmir valley and the Indus valley, the South Asian monsoon is no longer a dominant factor and most precipitation falls in the spring. Srinagar receives around {{convert|723|mm|abbr=on|0}} around half the rainfall of locations such as Shimla and Kathmandu, with the wettest months being March and April.\n\nThe northern side of the Himalayas, also known as the Tibetan Himalaya, is dry, cold and generally wind swept particularly in the west where it has a [[Desert climate#Cold desert climates|cold desert climate]]. The vegetation is sparse and stunted and the winters are severely cold. Most of the precipitation in the region is in the form of snow during late winter and spring months.\n\nLocal impacts on climate are significant throughout the Himalayas. Temperatures fall by {{Convert|6.5|C-change|1}} for every {{cvt|1000|m||}} rise in altitude. This gives rise to a variety of climates from a nearly tropical climate in the foothills, to [[tundra]] and permanent snow and ice at higher elevations. Local climate is also affected by the topography: The leeward side of the mountains receive less rain while the well exposed slopes get heavy rainfall and the [[rain shadow]] of large mountains can be significant, for example leading to near desert conditions in the [[Upper Mustang]] which is sheltered from the monsoon rains by the [[Annapurna]] and [[Dhaulagiri]] massifs and has annual precipitation of around {{cvt|300|mm|||}}, while [[Pokhara]] on the southern side of the massifs has substantial rainfall ({{cvt|3900|mm|disp=or||}} a year). Thus although annual precipitation is generally higher in east than the west, local variations are often more important.\n\nThe Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the Tibetan Plateau. They prevent frigid, dry winds from blowing south into the subcontinent, which keeps South Asia much warmer than corresponding [[temperate]] regions in the other continents. It also forms a barrier for the [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|monsoon]] winds, keeping them from traveling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the [[Terai]] region. The Himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of Central Asian deserts, such as the [[Taklamakan]] and [[Gobi]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Devitt|first=Terry|title=Climate shift linked to rise of Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau|newspaper=University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison News|date=3 May 2001|url=https://news.wisc.edu/climate-shift-linked-to-rise-of-himalayas-tibetan-plateau/|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nAn acceleration of [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850#Himalayas and Central Asia|ice loss across the Himalayas]] over the past 40 years has been proved with satellite photos.<ref>http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu 19.

The gorge splits the Himalayas into Western and Eastern sections both ecologically and orographically \u2013 the pass at the head of the Kali Gandaki the [[Kora La]] is the lowest point on the ridgeline between Everest and [[K2]] (the highest peak of the Karakoram range and of Pakistan). To the east of Annapurna are the {{convert|8000|m|mile|abbr=on}} peaks of [[Manaslu]] and across the border in Tibet, [[Shishapangma]]. To the south of these lies [[Kathmandu]], the capital of Nepal and the largest city in the Himalayas. East of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] lies valley of the Bhote/[[Sun Kosi]] river which rises in Tibet and provides the main overland route between Nepal and China \u2013 the [[Araniko Highway]]/[[China National Highway 318]]. Further east is the [[Mahalangur Himal]] with four of the world's six highest mountains, including the highest: [[Cho Oyu]], [[Everest]], [[Lhotse]] and [[Makalu]]. The [[Khumbu]] region, popular for trekking, is found here on the south-western approaches to Everest. The [[Arun River, China-Nepal|Arun river]] drains the northern slopes of these mountains, before turning south and flowing to the range to the east of Makalu.\n\nIn the far east of Nepal, the Himalayas rise to the [[Kanchenjunga]] massif on the border with India, the third highest mountain in the world, the most easterly {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on}} summit and the second highest point of India. The eastern side of Kanchenjunga is in the Indian state of [[Sikkim]]. Formerly an independent Kingdom, it lies on the main route from India to [[Lhasa]], Tibet, which passes over the [[Nathu La]] pass into the Tibet. East of Sikkim lies the ancient Buddhist Kingdom of [[Bhutan]]. The highest mountain in Bhutan is [[Gangkhar Puensum]], which is also a strong candidate for the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The Himalayas here are becoming increasingly rugged with heavily forested steep valleys. The Himalayas continue, turning slightly northeast, through the Indian State of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] as well as Tibet, before reaching their easterly conclusion in the peak of [[Namche Barwa]], situated in Tibet inside the great bend of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Yarlang Tsangpo]] river. On the other side of the Tsangpo, to the east, are the [[Kangri Garpo]] mountains. The high mountains to the north of the Tsangpo including [[Gyala Peri]], however, are also sometimes also included in the Himalayas.\n\nGoing west from Dhaulagiri, Western Nepal is somewhat remote and lacks major high mountains, but is home to [[Rara Lake]], the largest lake in Nepal. The [[Karnali River]] rises in Tibet but cuts through the center of the region. Further west, the border with [[India]] follows the [[Sarda River]] and provides a trade route into China, where on the Tibetan plateau lies the high peak of [[Gurla Mandhata]]. Just across [[Lake Manasarovar]] from this lies the sacred [[Mount Kailash]], which stands close to the source of the four main rivers of Himalayas and is revered in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Jainism, and Bonpo. In the newly created Indian state of [[Uttarkhand]], the Himalayas rise again as the Kumaon Himalayas with the high peaks of [[Nanda Devi]] and [[Kamet]]. The state is also an important pilgrimage destination, with the source of the Ganges at [[Gangotri]] and the Yamuna at [[Yamunotri]], and the temples at [[Badrinath]] and [[Kedarnath]].\n\nThe next Himalayan Indian state, [[Himachal Pradesh]], it is noted for its hill stations, particularly [[Shimla]], the summer capital of the [[British Raj]], and [[Dharmasala]], the centre of the Tibetan community in exile in India. This area marks the start of the Punjab Himalaya and the [[Sutlej river]], the most easterly of the five tributaries of the [[Indus]], cuts through the range here. Further west, the Himalayas form most of the southern portion of the Indian administered Union territories of [[Jammu & Kashmir]] and [[Ladakh]]. The twin peaks of [[Nun Kun]] are the only mountains over {{convert|7000|m|mile|abbr=on}} in this part of the Himalayas. Beyond lies the renown [[Kashmir Valley]] and the town and lakes of [[Srinagar]]. Finally, the Himalayas reach their western end in the dramatic 8000&nbsp;m peak of [[Nanga Parbat]], which rises over {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the Indus valley and is the most westerly of the 8000&nbsp;m summits. The western end terminates at a magnificent point near Nanga Parbat (killer mountain ) where Karakoram, Himalayas and Hindu Kush ranges intersects. It's situated in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\n\n==Geology==\n{{Main|Geology of the Himalaya}}\n[[File:Himalaya-formation.gif|thumb|upright|The {{convert|6000|km||adj=mid|-plus}} journey of the India landmass (Indian Plate) before its collision with Asia (Eurasian Plate) about 40 to 50 million [[Before Present|years ago]]<ref name=USGS/>]]\n\nThe Himalayan range is one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consists mostly of uplifted [[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock]]. According to the modern theory of [[plate tectonics]], its formation is a result of a [[continental collision]] or [[orogeny]] along the [[convergent boundary]] between the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The [[Arakan Yoma]] highlands in [[Burma|Myanmar]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] were also formed as a result of this collision.\n\nDuring the [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 70 million years ago, the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate (which has subsequently broken into the [[Indian Plate]] and the [[Australian Plate]]<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/95/18688.html (1995) Geologists Find: An Earth Plate Is Breaking in Two]</ref>) was moving at about {{cvt|15|cm|||}} per year. About 50 million years ago this fast moving Indo-Australian Plate had completely closed the [[Tethys Ocean]], the existence of which has been determined by [[sedimentary rock]]s settled on the ocean floor and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since both plates were composed of low density [[continental crust]], they were [[thrust fault]]ed and [[Fold (geology)|folded]] into mountain ranges rather than subducting into the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] along an [[oceanic trench]].<ref name=USGS/> An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine [[limestone]] from this ancient ocean.<ref>[https://www.thoughtco.com/mount-everest-overview-1435553 Mount Everest \u2013 Overview and Information] by Matt Rosenberg.

About 20&nbsp;mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by [[Thrust fault|thrusting]] along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5&nbsp;mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region [[seismic]]ally active, leading to earthquakes from time to time.\n\nDuring the last [[ice age]], there was a connected ice stream of [[glacier]]s between [[Kangchenjunga]] in the east and [[Nanga Parbat]] in the west.<ref name=Kuhle2011/><ref>glacier maps [http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780444534477/ downloadable]</ref> In the west, the glaciers joined with the ice stream network in the [[Karakoram]], and in the north, they joined with the former Tibetan inland ice.

As a result, the main ridge of the Himalayas is not clearly defined, and mountain passes are not as significant for traversing the range as with other mountain ranges. The rivers of the Himalayas drain into two large river systems:\n* The western rivers combine into the ''Indus Basin''. The [[Indus River|Indus]] itself forms the northern and western boundaries of the Himalayas. It begins in Tibet at the confluence of Sengge and Gar rivers and flows north-west through India into Pakistan before turning south-west to the [[Arabian Sea]]. It is fed by several major tributaries draining the southern slopes of the Himalayas, including the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], [[Chenab River|Chenab]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Beas River|Beas]] and [[Sutlej]] rivers, the five rivers of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].\n* The other Himalayan rivers drain the ''Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin''. Its main rivers are the [[Ganges]], the [[Brahmaputra]] and the [[Yamuna]], as well as other tributaries. The Brahmaputra originates as the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River (Tibet)|Yarlung Tsangpo River]] in western Tibet, and flows east through Tibet and west through the plains of [[Assam]]. The Ganges and the Brahmaputra meet in [[Bangladesh]] and drain into the [[Bay of Bengal]] through the world's largest river delta, the [[Sunderbans]].<ref name=gits4u/>\n\nThe northern slopes of [[Gyala Peri]] and the peaks beyond the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Tsangpo]], sometimes included in the Himalayas, drain into the [[Irrawaddy River]], which originates in eastern Tibet and flows south through Myanmar to drain into the [[Andaman Sea]]. The [[Salween]], [[Mekong]], [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]] all originate from parts of the Tibetan Plateau that are geologically distinct from the Himalaya mountains and are therefore not considered true Himalayan rivers.

For much of Himalayas \u2013 that on the south side of the high mountains, except in the furthest west, the most characteristic feature of the climate is the [[monsoon]]. Heavy rain arrives on the south-west monsoon in June and persists until September. The monsoon can seriously impact transport and cause major landslides. It restricts tourism \u2013 the trekking and mountaineering season is limited to either before the monsoon in April/May or after the monsoon in October/November (autumn). In Nepal and Sikkim, there are often considered to be five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]], autumn, (or post-monsoon), winter and spring.\n\nUsing the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], the lower elevations of the Himalayas, reaching in mid elevations in central Nepal (including the Kathmandu valley), are classified as ''Cwa'', [[humid subtropical climate#South Asia|Humid subtropical climate]] with dry winters. Higher up, most of the Himalayas have a [[Oceanic climate#Subtropical highland variety|subtropical highland climate (''Cwb'')]].\n\nIn the furthest west of the Himalayas, in the west of the Kashmir valley and the Indus valley, the South Asian monsoon is no longer a dominant factor and most precipitation falls in the spring. Srinagar receives around {{convert|723|mm|abbr=on|0}} around half the rainfall of locations such as Shimla and Kathmandu, with the wettest months being March and April.\n\nThe northern side of the Himalayas, also known as the Tibetan Himalaya, is dry, cold and generally wind swept particularly in the west where it has a [[Desert climate#Cold desert climates|cold desert climate]]. The vegetation is sparse and stunted and the winters are severely cold. Most of the precipitation in the region is in the form of snow during late winter and spring months.\n\nLocal impacts on climate are significant throughout the Himalayas. Temperatures fall by {{Convert|6.5|C-change|1}} for every {{cvt|1000|m||}} rise in altitude. This gives rise to a variety of climates from a nearly tropical climate in the foothills, to [[tundra]] and permanent snow and ice at higher elevations. Local climate is also affected by the topography: The leeward side of the mountains receive less rain while the well exposed slopes get heavy rainfall and the [[rain shadow]] of large mountains can be significant, for example leading to near desert conditions in the [[Upper Mustang]] which is sheltered from the monsoon rains by the [[Annapurna]] and [[Dhaulagiri]] massifs and has annual precipitation of around {{cvt|300|mm|||}}, while [[Pokhara]] on the southern side of the massifs has substantial rainfall ({{cvt|3900|mm|disp=or||}} a year). Thus although annual precipitation is generally higher in east than the west, local variations are often more important.\n\nThe Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the Tibetan Plateau. They prevent frigid, dry winds from blowing south into the subcontinent, which keeps South Asia much warmer than corresponding [[temperate]] regions in the other continents. It also forms a barrier for the [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|monsoon]] winds, keeping them from traveling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the [[Terai]] region. The Himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of Central Asian deserts, such as the [[Taklamakan]] and [[Gobi]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Devitt|first=Terry|title=Climate shift linked to rise of Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau|newspaper=University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison News|date=3 May 2001|url=https://news.wisc.edu/climate-shift-linked-to-rise-of-himalayas-tibetan-plateau/|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nAn acceleration of [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850#Himalayas and Central Asia|ice loss across the Himalayas]] over the past 40 years has been proved with satellite photos.<ref>http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu 19.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct.

In its initial appearance, it was sung by adult human cast members of the show (the most frequent lead singer was [[Bob McGrath]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}) and [[The Muppets|Muppets]], including [[Big Bird]].\n\n[[Barbra Streisand]]'s 1972 version of the song was released as a single, reaching number 28 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]] chart and number 94 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Many other versions of it have since been recorded by a variety of artists, including [[Trini Lopez]], who recorded a Spanish-language version in 1972 which appeared on his album, \"Viva\" (1972).\n\n==Background of The Carpenters version==\nAlthough [[Barbra Streisand]] had an [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]] hit in 1972 with \"Sing\", [[Karen Carpenter|Karen]] and [[Richard Carpenter (musician)|Richard Carpenter]] heard the song for the first time as guests on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television special ''Robert Young with the Young'' in 1973. They loved it and felt it could be a hit.<ref name=\"richardandkarencarpenter\"/> It acted as their debut single from the LP album ''[[Now & Then (The Carpenters album)|Now & Then]]'', released in 1973.<ref name=\"allmusic1\"/> It reached number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and number-one on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|easy listening]] chart,<ref>{{cite book |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961-2001|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2002 |publisher=Record Research |page=47}}</ref> and it became the group's seventh [[RIAA|gold single]].\n\nTheir recording of the song was produced and arranged by Richard, and engineered by Ray Gerhardt. The lead vocal was sung by Karen, with backing vocals by her, Richard, and the Jimmy Joyce Children's Choir. Keyboards were by Richard, bass by [[Joe Osborn]], drums by Karen, and recorders by [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]].<ref name=\"richardandkarencarpenter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.richardandkarencarpenter.com/SN_Sing.htm |title=Carpenters \u2022 Sing |website=Richardandkarencarpenter.com |date=2008-06-04 |accessdate=2016-10-08}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974 while touring [[Japan]], the Carpenters recorded their first live album in [[Osaka]]. It contained a new version of the song with the children's chorus sung by the Kyoto Children's Choir.

The same year, she played the mother of two deaf children in [[Robert Altman]]'s film ''[[Nashville]]''; they sang the song in the film. In 1976, on the eleventh episode of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', guest [[Lena Horne]] sang it. Later, [[Alaina Reed Hall|Alaina Reed]] (as Olivia) sang it, while [[Linda (Sesame Street)|Linda]] ([[Linda Bove]]) signed the lyrics. After the hurricane struck ''Sesame Street'' in 2001, [[Big Bird]] sang it in celebration of his nest being rebuilt.\n\nAs an iconic ''Sesame Street'' song, the song was used to close many of the show's anniversary specials, including ''Sesame Street: 20 and Still Counting'', ''Sesame Street's All-Star 25th Birthday: Stars and Street Forever'', ''Sesame Street: Unpaved'', ''Sesame Street's 25th Birthday: A Musical Celebration'', and ''Sesame Street's 50th Anniversary Celebration''. It was used for the title of the 1990 documentary that eulogized Raposo, ''Sing! Sesame Street Remembers Joe Raposo and His Music''.\n\nThe song was also used in animated segments. One segment involved Suzie Kabloozie (voiced by [[Ruth Buzzi]]) and her cat, Feff. Another involved Cab Callowmouse (parody of [[Cab Calloway]]), singing in an art museum as part of a medley. The other one featured a clay/sand animation segment of animals. \n\nIn 2000, various celebrities sang the song, including, [[Nathan Lane]], [[Denyce Graves]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Patti LaBelle]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Maya Angelou]], [[Fran Drescher]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Doug E.

Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===6===\n\n===5===\n*[[Ed Biles]], 88, American football coach ([[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]]), leukemia.<ref>[https://www.houstonchronicle.com/texas-sports-nation/texans/article/Former-Oiler-coach-Ed-Biles-dies-15180197.php Former Oiler coach Ed Biles dies]</ref>\n*[[DJ Miller]], 29, Rwandan DJ and musician, stroke.<ref>[https://www.ktpress.rw/2020/04/dj-miller-dies-at-29/ Dj Miller Dies At 29]</ref>\n*[[Shirley Douglas]], 86, Canadian actress and civil rights activist, complications from pneumonia.<ref>[https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/actress-activist-shirley-douglas-daughter-of-medicare-s-tommy-douglas-dies-1.4883465 Actress-activist Shirley Douglas, daughter of medicare's Tommy Douglas, dies]</ref>\n*[[Svein Ellingsen]], 90, Norwegian hymnist and visual artist.<ref>[https://www.itromso.no/ntb/iriks/2020/04/05/Salmedikter-Svein-Ellingsen-er-d%C3%B8d-21532580.ece Salmedikter Svein Ellingsen er d\u00f8d] {{in lang|no}}</ref>\n*[[Mahmoud Jibril]], 67, Libyan politician, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Libya)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and [[List of heads of government of Libya|Prime Minister]] (2011), [[COVID-19]].<ref>[http://en.alwasat.ly/news/libya/279080 Former Libyan PM Mahmoud Jibril has died from complications related to coronavirus]</ref>\n*[[John Laws (judge)|Sir John Laws]], 74, English jurist, [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|High Court Judge]] (1992\u20131998) and [[Court of Appeal judge (England and Wales)|Lord Justice of Appeal]] (1999\u20132016), [[COVID-19]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/apr/05/retired-senior-judge-sir-john-laws-dies-after-contracting-coronavirus Retired judge and Cummings' uncle Sir John Laws dies after contracting coronavirus]</ref>\n*[[Pentti Linkola]], 87, Finnish deep ecologist and writer.<ref>[https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-11293151 Luonnonsuojelija Pentti Linkola on kuollut] {{in lang|fi}}</ref> \n*[[Dougie Morgan]], 73, Scottish rugby union player ([[Stewart's Melville RFC|Stewart's Melville]], [[British and Irish Lions]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|national team]]).<ref>[https://www.theoffsideline.com/stewarts-melville-scotland-and-lions-great-dougie-morgan-passes-away/ Stewart\u2019s Melville, Scotland and Lions great Dougie Morgan passes away]</ref>\n\n===4===\n*[[Luis Eduardo Aute]], 76, Filipino-born Spanish artist.<ref>[https://www.elperiodico.com/es/ocio-y-cultura/20200404/muere-luis-eduardo-aute-a-los-76-anos-7917458 Muere Luis Eduardo Aute a los 76 a\u00f1os] {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n*[[Jay Benedict]], 68, American actor (''[[Foyle's War]]'', ''[[Double Team (film)|Double Team]]'', ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]''), [[COVID-19]].<ref>[https://www.fanthatracks.com/news/film-music-tv/rest-in-peace-jay-benedict-deak-in-a-new-hope/ Rest in peace Jay Benedict, Deak in A New Hope]</ref>\n*[[Philippe Bodson]], 75, Belgian businessman and politician, [[Senate (Belgium)|Senator]] (1999\u20132003), [[COVID-19]].<ref>[https://www.rtbf.be/info/economie/detail_coronavirus-philippe-bodson-ex-patron-de-tractebel-de-la-feb-et-glaverbel-est-decede-ce-matin?id=10475652 Coronavirus : Philippe Bodson, ex-patron de Tractebel, de la FEB et Glaverbel, est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 ce matin] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n*[[Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero]], 76, Honduran politician, [[President of Honduras|President]] (1990\u20131994), cardiac arrest.<ref>[https://www.latribuna.hn/2020/04/04/muere-el-expresidente-de-honduras-rafael-leonardo-callejas/ Muere el expresidente de Honduras, Rafael Leonardo Callejas] {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n*[[Forrest Compton]], 94, American actor (''[[The Edge of Night]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', ''[[The F.B.I.
