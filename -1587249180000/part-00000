Following their television work, they began making films, including ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975), ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' (1979) and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983). Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while in North America, it has coloured the work of [[cult following|cult]] performers from the early editions of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' through to more recent [[Surreal humour|absurdist]] trends in television comedy. \"[[wikt:Pythonesque|Pythonesque]]\" has entered the English lexicon as a result.\n\nAt the [[41st British Academy Film Awards]] in 1988, Monty Python received the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema.

At the same time, Chapman and Cleese were offered a show by the [[BBC]], which had been impressed by their work on ''The Frost Report'' and ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Cleese was reluctant to do a [[Double act|two-man show]] for various reasons, including Chapman's supposedly difficult and erratic personality. Cleese had fond memories of working with Palin on ''How to Irritate People'' and invited him to join the team. With no studio available at Thames until summer 1970 for the late-night show, Palin agreed to join Cleese and Chapman, and suggested the involvement of his writing partner Jones and colleague Idle\u2014who in turn wanted Gilliam to provide animations for the projected series. Much has been made of the fact that the Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.<ref name=\"auto\">''The Pythons Autobiography by the Pythons''.

They were admirers of the work of [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], and [[Dudley Moore]] on ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]''\u2014seminal to the British \"[[satire boom]]\"\u2014and had worked on ''Frost'', which was similar in style.<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1377417/index.html \"The Roots of Monty Python\"]. BFI Screenonline. Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> They enjoyed Cook and Moore's sketch show ''[[Not Only... But Also]]''. One problem the Pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong, the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on, and this would detract from the overall sketch quality. They decided that they would simply not bother to \"cap\" their sketches in the traditional manner, and early episodes of the ''Flying Circus'' series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline (one scene has Cleese turn to Idle, as the sketch descends into chaos, and remark that \"This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in\"\u2014they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set).<ref>[http://www.montypython.net/scripts/silliest.php \"The Silliest Interview We've Ever Had / The Silliest Sketch We've Ever Done\"]. MontyPython.net. Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> However, as they began assembling material for the show, the Pythons watched one of their collective heroes, [[Spike Milligan]], whom they had admired on ''[[The Goon Show]]'' (a show the Pythons regard as their biggest influence, which also featured [[Peter Sellers]], whom Cleese called \u201cthe greatest voice man of all time\u201d) recording his groundbreaking BBC series ''[[Q...

Featuring Cleese as a [[bowler hat|bowler-hatted]] [[civil servant]] in a fictitious British government ministry responsible for developing silly walks through [[Grant (money)|grants]], it appears in season 2, episode 1 of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.]]\nAfter much debate, Jones remembered an animation Gilliam had created for ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' called \"Beware of the Elephants\", which had intrigued him with its stream-of-consciousness style. Jones felt it would be a good concept to apply to the series: allowing sketches to blend into one another. Palin had been equally fascinated by another of Gilliam's efforts, entitled \"Christmas Cards\", and agreed that it represented \"a way of doing things differently\". Since Cleese, Chapman, and Idle were less concerned with the overall flow of the programme, Jones, Palin, and Gilliam became largely responsible for the presentation style of the ''Flying Circus'' series, in which disparate sketches are linked to give each episode the appearance of a single [[stream-of-consciousness]] (often using a Gilliam animation to move from the closing image of one sketch to the opening scene of another).<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/> The BBC states, \u201cGilliam's unique animation style became crucial, segueing seamlessly between any two completely unrelated ideas and making the stream-of-consciousness work.\u201d<ref name=\"Circus profile\">{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/ |accessdate=24 August 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\nWriting started at 9&nbsp;am and finished at 5&nbsp;pm. Typically, Cleese and Chapman worked as one pair isolated from the others, as did Jones and Palin, while Idle wrote alone. After a few days, they would join together with Gilliam, critique their scripts, and exchange ideas. Their approach to writing was democratic. If the majority found an idea humorous, it was included in the show. The casting of roles for the sketches was a similarly unselfish process, since each member viewed himself primarily as a \"writer\", rather than an actor eager for screen time. When the themes for sketches were chosen, Gilliam had a free hand in bridging them with animations, using a camera, scissors, and airbrush.<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/>\n\n[[file:Monty_Python_Live_02-07-14_12_46_43_(14415411808).jpg|thumb|left|Gilliam, Palin and Jones performing \u201c[[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|The Spanish Inquisition]]\u201d sketch during the 2014 Python reunion. As a sketch writer and creator of the animations, although Gilliam did considerably less acting, he did have some notable sketch roles such as this (Cardinal Fang).]]\nWhile the show was a collaborative process, different factions within Python were responsible for elements of the team's humour. In general, the work of the Oxford-educated members (Jones and Palin) was more visual, and more fanciful conceptually (e.g., the arrival of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in a suburban front room), while the Cambridge graduates' sketches tended to be more verbal and more aggressive (for example, Cleese and Chapman's many \"confrontation\" sketches, where one character intimidates or hurls abuse, or Idle's characters with bizarre verbal quirks, such as \"The Man Who Speaks In [[Anagram]]s\"). Cleese confirmed that \"most of the sketches with heavy abuse were Graham's and mine, anything that started with a slow pan across countryside and impressive music was Mike and Terry's, and anything that got utterly involved with words and disappeared up any personal orifice was Eric's\".<ref>Wilmut (1980), p. 211</ref> Gilliam's animations ranged from the whimsical to the savage (the cartoon format allowing him to create some astonishingly violent scenes without fear of censorship).<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/>\n\nSeveral names for the show were considered before ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' was settled upon. Some were ''Owl Stretching Time'', ''The Toad Elevating Moment'', ''A Horse, a Spoon and a Bucket'', ''Vaseline Review'', and ''Bun, Wackett, Buzzard, Stubble and Boot''. ''Flying Circus'' stuck when the BBC explained it had printed that name in its schedules and was not prepared to amend it. Many variations on the name in front of this title then came and went (popular legend holds that the BBC considered ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' to be a ridiculous name, at which point the group threatened to change their name every week until the BBC relented). ''Gwen Dibley's Flying Circus'' was named after a woman Palin had read about in the newspaper, thinking it would be amusing if she were to discover she had her own TV show. ''Baron Von Took's Flying Circus'' was considered as an affectionate tribute to [[Barry Took]], the man who had brought them together.<ref>{{cite news| first= Douglas |last= Martin |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/14/nyregion/barry-took-73-father-of-monty-python-dies.html |title= Barry Took, 73, Father of Monty Python, Dies| work= [[The New York Times]]| date= 14 April 2002| accessdate= 1 May 2015}}</ref> ''Arthur Megapode's Flying Circus'' was suggested, then discarded. The name ''Baron Von Took's Flying Circus'' had the form of ''[[Baron Manfred von Richthofen]]'s [[Manfred von Richthofen#Flying Circus|Flying Circus]]'' of WWI fame, and the new group was forming in a time when the [[Royal Guardsmen]]'s 1966 song \"[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (song)|Snoopy vs. the Red Baron]]\" had peaked. The term 'flying circus' was also another name for the popular entertainment of the 1920s known as [[flying circus|barnstorming]], where multiple performers collaborated with their stunts to perform a combined set of acts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus \u2013 Four Yorkshiremen |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2008/02/monty-pythons-flying-circus-four-yorkshiremen.html |accessdate=21 August 2019 |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]}}</ref>\n\nDiffering, somewhat confusing accounts are given of the origins of the Python name, although the members agree that its only \"significance\" was that they thought it sounded funny. In the 1998 documentary ''Live at Aspen'' during the [[The Comedy Festival|US Comedy Arts Festival]], where the troupe was awarded the AFI Star Award by the [[American Film Institute]], the group implied that \"Monty\" was selected (Eric Idle's idea) as a gently mocking tribute to [[Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Lord Montgomery]], a British general of [[World War II]]; requiring a \"slippery-sounding\" surname, they settled on \"Python\". On other occasions, Idle has claimed that the name \"Monty\" was that of a popular and rotund fellow who drank in his local pub; people would often walk in and ask the barman, \"Has Monty been in yet?\", forcing the name to become stuck in his mind. The name Monty Python was later described by the BBC as being \"envisaged by the team as the perfect name for a sleazy entertainment agent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/index.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Comedy \u2013 Monty Python}}</ref>\n\n===Style of the show===\n''Flying Circus'' popularised innovative formal techniques, such as the [[cold open]], in which an episode began without the traditional opening titles or announcements.<ref name=MBC_piece>{{cite web|last=Museum of Broadcast Communications|title=Monty Python's Flying Circus|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/montypython/montypython.htm}}</ref> An example of this is the \"It's\" man: Palin, outfitted in [[Robinson Crusoe]] garb, making a tortuous journey across various terrains, before finally approaching the camera to state, \"It's&nbsp;...\", only to be then cut off by the [[title sequence]] and theme music. On several occasions, the cold open lasted until mid-show, after which the regular opening titles ran. Occasionally, the Pythons tricked viewers by rolling the [[closing credits]] halfway through the show, usually continuing the joke by fading to the familiar [[History of BBC television idents|globe logo]] used for BBC continuity, over which Cleese would parody the clipped tones of a BBC announcer.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python: a golden age of British comedy |url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/monty-python-a-golden-age-of-british-comedy-1.371481 |accessdate=20 August 2019 |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}</ref> On one occasion, the credits ran directly after the opening titles.

A classic example of this approach was the use of Chapman's \"anti-silliness\" character of \"[[The Colonel (Monty Python)|the Colonel]]\", who walked into several sketches and ordered them to be stopped because things were becoming \"far too silly\".<ref>{{cite news|first=William|last=Langley|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/10948113/Monty-Python-Will-the-wrinkly-revolutionaries-have-the-last-laugh.html|title=Monty Python : Will the wrinkly revolutionaries have the last laugh?|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=5 July 2014|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Monty python foot.png|thumb|right|[[The Foot of Cupid|Cupid's foot]], as used by ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''.

Garrison produced the NBC series ''[[The Dean Martin Comedy World]]'', which ran during the summer of 1974.  The concept was to show clips from comedy shows produced in other countries, including tape of the Python sketches \"Bicycle Repairman\" and \"The Dull Life of a Stockbroker\". Payment for use of these two sketches was enough to allow Time-Life Films to convert the entire Python library to NTSC standard, allowing for the sale to the PBS network stations which then brought the entire show to US audiences.\n\nIn 1975, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] broadcast two 90-minute ''Monty Python'' specials, each with three shows, but cut out a total of 24 minutes from each, in part to make time for commercials, and in part to avoid upsetting their audience.  As the judge observed in ''[[Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.]]'', where Monty Python sued for damages caused by broadcast of the mutilated version, \"According to the network, appellants should have anticipated that most of the excised material contained scatological references inappropriate for American television and that these scenes would be replaced with commercials, which presumably are more palatable to the American public.\"  Monty Python won the case.<ref>{{cite web|ref=harv|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/integrity/Links/Cases/gilliam.html|title=Terry Gilliam et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants-Appellees, v.

''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' was based on [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]] and was directed by Jones and Gilliam. Again, the latter also contributed linking animations (and put together the opening credits). Along with the rest of the Pythons, Jones and Gilliam performed several roles in the film, but Chapman took the lead as King Arthur. Cleese returned to the group for the film, feeling that they were once again breaking new ground. ''Holy Grail'' was filmed on location, in picturesque rural areas of Scotland, with a budget of only \u00a3229,000; the money was raised in part with investments from rock groups such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], and [[Led Zeppelin]], as well as UK music industry entrepreneur [[Tony Stratton-Smith]] (founder and owner of the [[Charisma Records]] label, for which the Pythons recorded their comedy albums).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-05-06/entertainment/0905050391_1_holy-grail-monty-python-john-goldstone|title=Cue the coconuts: 'Holy Grail' gallops on|last=Johnson|first=Steve|date=6 May 2009|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe backers of the film wanted to cut the famous [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|Black Knight]] scene (a [[Sam Peckinpah]] send-up in which the Black Knight loses his limbs in a duel), but it was eventually kept in the movie.<ref>Interview with John Cleese on Q-The Podcast with host John Ghomeshi, on 16 July 2009</ref> \"Tis but a scratch\" and \"It's just a flesh wound\u2026\" are often quoted.<ref name=\"Python quotes\">{{cite news |title=49 of Monty Python's most absurdly funny jokes and quotes |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/read-this/49-of-monty-pythons-most-absurdly-funny-jokes-and-quotes/ |accessdate=18 August 2019 |work=Yorkshire Post}}</ref> ''Holy Grail'' was selected as the second-best comedy of all time in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] special ''[[Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time]]''. and viewers in a [[Channel 4]] poll placed it sixth.<ref name=\"Channel4 comedies\"/>\n\n====''Monty Python's Life of Brian'' (1979)====\n{{Main|Monty Python's Life of Brian}}\nFollowing the success of ''Holy Grail'', reporters asked for the title of the next Python film, despite the fact that the team had not even begun to consider a third one. Eventually, Idle flippantly replied \"Jesus Christ \u2013 Lust for Glory\", which became the group's stock answer once they realised that it shut reporters up.<ref>{{cite news |title=How we made Monty Python's Life of Brian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/16/how-we-made-monty-python-life-of-brian-michael-palin-terry-gilliam |accessdate=25 August 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> However, they soon began to seriously consider a film lampooning the [[New Testament]] era in the same way ''Holy Grail'' had lampooned Arthurian legend. Despite sharing a distrust of organised religion, they agreed not to mock Jesus or his teachings directly. They also mentioned that they could not think of anything legitimate to make fun of about him.<ref name=\"theologian\"/> Instead, they decided to write a satire on credulity and hypocrisy among the followers of someone [Brian] who had been mistaken for the \"Messiah\", but who had no desire to be followed as such.<ref name=\"TJones\"/> Terry Jones adds it was a satire on those who for the next 2,000 years \"couldn't agree on what Jesus was saying about peace and love\".<ref name=\"TJones\"/>\n\n{{quote box|width=30%|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"We are three wise men.\"<br />\n\"Well, what are you doing creeping around a cow shed at two o'clock in the morning?

When Jesus appears in the film (first, as a baby in the stable, and then later on [[Mount of Olives|the Mount]], speaking the [[Beatitudes]]), he is played straight (by actor [[Kenneth Colley]]) and portrayed with respect.

A series of sketches loosely follows the ages of man from birth to death. Directed again by Jones solo, ''The Meaning of Life'' is embellished with some of the group's most bizarre and disturbing moments, as well as various elaborate musical numbers, which include \"[[Galaxy Song]]\" (performed by Idle) and \"[[Every Sperm Is Sacred]]\" (performed by Palin and Jones).<ref name=\"Making Meaning\">{{cite news |title=How we made Monty Python's The Meaning of Life |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/30/monty-python-meaning-of-life |accessdate=24 August 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> The film is by far their darkest work, containing a great deal of [[Black comedy|black humour]], garnished by some spectacular violence (including an operation to remove a [[liver]] from a living patient without [[anaesthetic]] and the morbidly obese [[Mr Creosote|Mr. Creosote]] exploding over several restaurant patrons after finally giving in to the smooth ma\u00eetre d' telling him to eat a mint \u2013 \"It's only a wafer-thin mint...\").<ref name=\"Python quotes\"/> At the time of its release, the Pythons confessed their aim was to offend \"absolutely everyone\", adding \"It is guaranteed to offend\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python's The Meaning of Life |url=https://ew.com/article/1998/04/03/monty-pythons-meaning-life/ |accessdate=19 August 2019 |work=EW}}</ref>\n\nThe Liver Donor scene (which sees someone come to a man's door to take his liver, to which he says: \"No, no, I'm not dead\", before being told: \"Oooh, it doesn't say that on the form\"), is a satire on bureaucracy, a common Python trope.<ref name=\"Making Meaning\"/> Besides the opening credits and the fish sequence, Gilliam, by now an established live-action director, no longer wanted to produce any linking cartoons, offering instead to direct one sketch, \"[[The Crimson Permanent Assurance]]\". Under his helm, though, the segment grew so ambitious and tangential that it was cut from the movie and used as a supporting feature in its own right. (Television screenings also use it as a prologue.) This was the last project on which all six Pythons collaborated, except for the 1989 compilation ''[[Parrot Sketch Not Included \u2013 20 Years of Monty Python|Parrot Sketch Not Included]],'' where they are all seen sitting in a closet for four seconds.

Cleese's feeling was that ''The Meaning of Life'' had been personally difficult and ultimately mediocre, and did not wish to be involved in another Python project for a variety of reasons (not least amongst them was the absence of Chapman, whose straight man-like central roles in the ''Grail'' and ''Brian'' films had been considered to be an essential anchoring performance).

That left two in their own corners: Gilliam, operating solo due to the nature of his work, and [[Eric Idle]]. Regular themes in Idle's contributions were elaborate [[wordplay]] and musical numbers. After ''Flying Circus'', he hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' four times in the first five seasons. Idle's initially successful solo career faltered in the 1990s with the failures of his 1993 film ''[[Splitting Heirs]]'' (written, produced by, and starring him) and 1998's ''[[An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn]]'' (in which he starred). He revived his career by returning to the source of his worldwide fame, adapting Monty Python material for other media. Idle wrote the [[Tony Award]]-winning musical ''[[Spamalot]]'', based on ''Holy Grail''. Following the success of the musical he wrote ''[[Not the Messiah (He's a Very Naughty Boy)|Not the Messiah]]'', an [[oratorio]] derived from the ''Life of Brian''.<ref>Eric Idle, [Email letter to] \"The Pythons,\" 20 December 2006.

Jones had a lead role in maintaining the group's unity and creative independence. Python biographer George Perry has commented that should \"[you] speak to him on subjects as diverse as [[fossil fuel]]s, or [[Rupert Bear]], or mercenaries in the [[Middle Ages]] or Modern China&nbsp;... in a moment you will find yourself hopelessly out of your depth, floored by his knowledge.\"<ref>Perry, George (2007). ''The Life of Python''. p. 40. Pavilion</ref> Many others agree that Jones is characterised by his irrepressible, good-natured enthusiasm. However, Jones' passion often led to prolonged arguments with other group members\u2014in particular Cleese\u2014with Jones often unwilling to back down. Since his major contributions were largely behind the scenes (direction, writing), and he often deferred to the other members of the group as an actor, Jones' importance to Python was often under-rated. However, he does have the legacy of delivering possibly the most famous line in all of Python, as Brian's mother Mandy in ''Life of Brian'', \"He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!\", a line voted the funniest in film history on two occasions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,2131880,00.html|title=The last laugh: your favourite 50|work=The Observer|location=UK|first1=Philip|last1=French|first2=Mark|last2=Kermode|first3=Jason|last3=Solomons|first4=Akin|last4=Ojumu|first5=Killian|last5=Fox|date=22 July 2007|accessdate=21 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1385293/Life-of-Brian-wins-the-vote-for-film's-best-laughter-line.html|title=Life of Brian wins the vote for film's best laughter line|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Sarah|last=Womack|date=19 February 2002|accessdate=21 September 2008|location=London}}</ref> Jones died on 21 January 2020 from complications of dementia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python star Terry Jones dies aged 77 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51209197 |accessdate=22 January 2020 |work=BBC News |date=22 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Palin|Sir Michael Palin]] attended [[Oxford University|Oxford]], where he met his Python writing partner Jones. The two also wrote the series ''Ripping Yarns'' together. Palin and Jones originally wrote face-to-face, but soon found it was more productive to write apart and then come together to review what the other had written. Therefore, Jones and Palin's sketches tended to be more focused than that of the others, taking one bizarre situation, sticking to it, and building on it. After ''Flying Circus'', Palin hosted ''Saturday Night Live'' four times in the first 10 seasons. His comedy output began to decrease in amount following the increasing success of his travel documentaries for the BBC. Palin released a book of diaries from the Python years entitled ''Michael Palin Diaries 1969\u20131979'', published in 2007.

He would later portray Ron Nasty of [[the Rutles]] and write all of the Rutles' compositions for ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' (1978), a [[mockumentary]] film co-directed by Idle. By 2005, a falling out had occurred between Idle and Innes over additional Rutles projects, the results being Innes' critically acclaimed Rutles \"reunion\" album ''The Rutles: Archaeology'' and Idle's straight-to-DVD ''The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch'', each undertaken without the other's participation.

Firstly, in the episode \"The Light Entertainment War\", Adams shows up in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to the on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while Palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another, and never actually gets started. Secondly, at the beginning of \"Mr. Neutron\", Adams is dressed in a \"pepperpot\" outfit and loads a missile onto a cart being driven by Terry Jones, who is calling out for scrap metal (\"Any old iron&nbsp;...\").

He appeared in the first two series of the show, and played over 10 roles. While Davidson is primarily known as a scriptwriter, it is not known if he had any contribution toward the writing of the sketches, as he is only credited as a performer. In total, Davidson is credited as appearing in eight episodes of the show, which is more than any other male actor who was not a Python.

Izzard hosted ''The Life of Python'' (1999), a history of the group that was part of Python Night and appeared with them at a festival/tribute in [[Aspen, Colorado]], in 1998 (released on DVD as ''Live at Aspen'').

Following their television work, they began making films, including ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975), ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' (1979) and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983). Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while in North America, it has coloured the work of [[cult following|cult]] performers from the early editions of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' through to more recent [[Surreal humour|absurdist]] trends in television comedy. \"[[wikt:Pythonesque|Pythonesque]]\" has entered the English lexicon as a result.\n\nAt the [[41st British Academy Film Awards]] in 1988, Monty Python received the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema. In 1998 they were awarded the AFI Star Award by the [[American Film Institute]]. Many sketches from their TV show and films are well-known and widely quoted. Both ''Holy Grail'' and ''Life of Brian'' are frequently ranked in lists of greatest comedy films. In a 2005 poll of over 300 comics, comedy writers, producers and directors throughout the [[English-speaking world]] to find \"The Comedian's Comedian\", three of the six Pythons members were voted to be among the top 50 greatest comedians ever: Cleese at No. 2, Idle at No. 21, and Palin at No. 30.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cook tops poll of comedy greats|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/02/arts.artsnews|work=The Guardian|date=2 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4141019.stm|title=Cook voted 'comedians' comedian'|work=BBC News|date=2 January 2005|accessdate=21 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Before ''Flying Circus''==\nJones and Palin met at [[Oxford University]], where they performed together with [[the Oxford Revue]].

At the same time, Chapman and Cleese were offered a show by the [[BBC]], which had been impressed by their work on ''The Frost Report'' and ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Cleese was reluctant to do a [[Double act|two-man show]] for various reasons, including Chapman's supposedly difficult and erratic personality. Cleese had fond memories of working with Palin on ''How to Irritate People'' and invited him to join the team. With no studio available at Thames until summer 1970 for the late-night show, Palin agreed to join Cleese and Chapman, and suggested the involvement of his writing partner Jones and colleague Idle\u2014who in turn wanted Gilliam to provide animations for the projected series. Much has been made of the fact that the Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.<ref name=\"auto\">''The Pythons Autobiography by the Pythons''.

Thomas Dunne Books; Orion, 2003</ref>\n\nBy contrast, according to John Cleese's autobiography, the origins of ''Monty Python'' lay in the admiration that writing partners Cleese and Chapman had for the new type of comedy being done on ''Do Not Adjust Your Set''; as a result, a meeting was initiated by Cleese between Chapman, Idle, Jones, Palin, and himself at which it was agreed to pool their writing and performing efforts and jointly seek production sponsorship.<ref>''So, Anyway ...'' by John Cleese; Crown Archetype, London, 2014</ref> According to their official website, the group was born from a Kashmir tandoori restaurant in Hampstead on 11 May 1969, following a taping of ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' which Cleese and Chapman attended.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McCall |first1=Douglas.

They were admirers of the work of [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], and [[Dudley Moore]] on ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]''\u2014seminal to the British \"[[satire boom]]\"\u2014and had worked on ''Frost'', which was similar in style.<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1377417/index.html \"The Roots of Monty Python\"]. BFI Screenonline. Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> They enjoyed Cook and Moore's sketch show ''[[Not Only... But Also]]''. One problem the Pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong, the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on, and this would detract from the overall sketch quality. They decided that they would simply not bother to \"cap\" their sketches in the traditional manner, and early episodes of the ''Flying Circus'' series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline (one scene has Cleese turn to Idle, as the sketch descends into chaos, and remark that \"This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in\"\u2014they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set).<ref>[http://www.montypython.net/scripts/silliest.php \"The Silliest Interview We've Ever Had / The Silliest Sketch We've Ever Done\"]. MontyPython.net. Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> However, as they began assembling material for the show, the Pythons watched one of their collective heroes, [[Spike Milligan]], whom they had admired on ''[[The Goon Show]]'' (a show the Pythons regard as their biggest influence, which also featured [[Peter Sellers]], whom Cleese called \u201cthe greatest voice man of all time\u201d) recording his groundbreaking BBC series ''[[Q...

Featuring Cleese as a [[bowler hat|bowler-hatted]] [[civil servant]] in a fictitious British government ministry responsible for developing silly walks through [[Grant (money)|grants]], it appears in season 2, episode 1 of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.]]\nAfter much debate, Jones remembered an animation Gilliam had created for ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' called \"Beware of the Elephants\", which had intrigued him with its stream-of-consciousness style. Jones felt it would be a good concept to apply to the series: allowing sketches to blend into one another. Palin had been equally fascinated by another of Gilliam's efforts, entitled \"Christmas Cards\", and agreed that it represented \"a way of doing things differently\". Since Cleese, Chapman, and Idle were less concerned with the overall flow of the programme, Jones, Palin, and Gilliam became largely responsible for the presentation style of the ''Flying Circus'' series, in which disparate sketches are linked to give each episode the appearance of a single [[stream-of-consciousness]] (often using a Gilliam animation to move from the closing image of one sketch to the opening scene of another).<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/> The BBC states, \u201cGilliam's unique animation style became crucial, segueing seamlessly between any two completely unrelated ideas and making the stream-of-consciousness work.\u201d<ref name=\"Circus profile\">{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/ |accessdate=24 August 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\nWriting started at 9&nbsp;am and finished at 5&nbsp;pm. Typically, Cleese and Chapman worked as one pair isolated from the others, as did Jones and Palin, while Idle wrote alone. After a few days, they would join together with Gilliam, critique their scripts, and exchange ideas. Their approach to writing was democratic. If the majority found an idea humorous, it was included in the show. The casting of roles for the sketches was a similarly unselfish process, since each member viewed himself primarily as a \"writer\", rather than an actor eager for screen time. When the themes for sketches were chosen, Gilliam had a free hand in bridging them with animations, using a camera, scissors, and airbrush.<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/>\n\n[[file:Monty_Python_Live_02-07-14_12_46_43_(14415411808).jpg|thumb|left|Gilliam, Palin and Jones performing \u201c[[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|The Spanish Inquisition]]\u201d sketch during the 2014 Python reunion. As a sketch writer and creator of the animations, although Gilliam did considerably less acting, he did have some notable sketch roles such as this (Cardinal Fang).]]\nWhile the show was a collaborative process, different factions within Python were responsible for elements of the team's humour. In general, the work of the Oxford-educated members (Jones and Palin) was more visual, and more fanciful conceptually (e.g., the arrival of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in a suburban front room), while the Cambridge graduates' sketches tended to be more verbal and more aggressive (for example, Cleese and Chapman's many \"confrontation\" sketches, where one character intimidates or hurls abuse, or Idle's characters with bizarre verbal quirks, such as \"The Man Who Speaks In [[Anagram]]s\"). Cleese confirmed that \"most of the sketches with heavy abuse were Graham's and mine, anything that started with a slow pan across countryside and impressive music was Mike and Terry's, and anything that got utterly involved with words and disappeared up any personal orifice was Eric's\".<ref>Wilmut (1980), p. 211</ref> Gilliam's animations ranged from the whimsical to the savage (the cartoon format allowing him to create some astonishingly violent scenes without fear of censorship).<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/>\n\nSeveral names for the show were considered before ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' was settled upon. Some were ''Owl Stretching Time'', ''The Toad Elevating Moment'', ''A Horse, a Spoon and a Bucket'', ''Vaseline Review'', and ''Bun, Wackett, Buzzard, Stubble and Boot''. ''Flying Circus'' stuck when the BBC explained it had printed that name in its schedules and was not prepared to amend it. Many variations on the name in front of this title then came and went (popular legend holds that the BBC considered ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' to be a ridiculous name, at which point the group threatened to change their name every week until the BBC relented). ''Gwen Dibley's Flying Circus'' was named after a woman Palin had read about in the newspaper, thinking it would be amusing if she were to discover she had her own TV show. ''Baron Von Took's Flying Circus'' was considered as an affectionate tribute to [[Barry Took]], the man who had brought them together.<ref>{{cite news| first= Douglas |last= Martin |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/14/nyregion/barry-took-73-father-of-monty-python-dies.html |title= Barry Took, 73, Father of Monty Python, Dies| work= [[The New York Times]]| date= 14 April 2002| accessdate= 1 May 2015}}</ref> ''Arthur Megapode's Flying Circus'' was suggested, then discarded. The name ''Baron Von Took's Flying Circus'' had the form of ''[[Baron Manfred von Richthofen]]'s [[Manfred von Richthofen#Flying Circus|Flying Circus]]'' of WWI fame, and the new group was forming in a time when the [[Royal Guardsmen]]'s 1966 song \"[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (song)|Snoopy vs. the Red Baron]]\" had peaked. The term 'flying circus' was also another name for the popular entertainment of the 1920s known as [[flying circus|barnstorming]], where multiple performers collaborated with their stunts to perform a combined set of acts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus \u2013 Four Yorkshiremen |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2008/02/monty-pythons-flying-circus-four-yorkshiremen.html |accessdate=21 August 2019 |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]}}</ref>\n\nDiffering, somewhat confusing accounts are given of the origins of the Python name, although the members agree that its only \"significance\" was that they thought it sounded funny. In the 1998 documentary ''Live at Aspen'' during the [[The Comedy Festival|US Comedy Arts Festival]], where the troupe was awarded the AFI Star Award by the [[American Film Institute]], the group implied that \"Monty\" was selected (Eric Idle's idea) as a gently mocking tribute to [[Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Lord Montgomery]], a British general of [[World War II]]; requiring a \"slippery-sounding\" surname, they settled on \"Python\". On other occasions, Idle has claimed that the name \"Monty\" was that of a popular and rotund fellow who drank in his local pub; people would often walk in and ask the barman, \"Has Monty been in yet?\", forcing the name to become stuck in his mind. The name Monty Python was later described by the BBC as being \"envisaged by the team as the perfect name for a sleazy entertainment agent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/index.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Comedy \u2013 Monty Python}}</ref>\n\n===Style of the show===\n''Flying Circus'' popularised innovative formal techniques, such as the [[cold open]], in which an episode began without the traditional opening titles or announcements.<ref name=MBC_piece>{{cite web|last=Museum of Broadcast Communications|title=Monty Python's Flying Circus|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/montypython/montypython.htm}}</ref> An example of this is the \"It's\" man: Palin, outfitted in [[Robinson Crusoe]] garb, making a tortuous journey across various terrains, before finally approaching the camera to state, \"It's&nbsp;...\", only to be then cut off by the [[title sequence]] and theme music. On several occasions, the cold open lasted until mid-show, after which the regular opening titles ran. Occasionally, the Pythons tricked viewers by rolling the [[closing credits]] halfway through the show, usually continuing the joke by fading to the familiar [[History of BBC television idents|globe logo]] used for BBC continuity, over which Cleese would parody the clipped tones of a BBC announcer.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python: a golden age of British comedy |url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/monty-python-a-golden-age-of-british-comedy-1.371481 |accessdate=20 August 2019 |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}</ref> On one occasion, the credits ran directly after the opening titles.

A classic example of this approach was the use of Chapman's \"anti-silliness\" character of \"[[The Colonel (Monty Python)|the Colonel]]\", who walked into several sketches and ordered them to be stopped because things were becoming \"far too silly\".<ref>{{cite news|first=William|last=Langley|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/10948113/Monty-Python-Will-the-wrinkly-revolutionaries-have-the-last-laugh.html|title=Monty Python : Will the wrinkly revolutionaries have the last laugh?|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=5 July 2014|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Monty python foot.png|thumb|right|[[The Foot of Cupid|Cupid's foot]], as used by ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''.

Garrison produced the NBC series ''[[The Dean Martin Comedy World]]'', which ran during the summer of 1974.  The concept was to show clips from comedy shows produced in other countries, including tape of the Python sketches \"Bicycle Repairman\" and \"The Dull Life of a Stockbroker\". Payment for use of these two sketches was enough to allow Time-Life Films to convert the entire Python library to NTSC standard, allowing for the sale to the PBS network stations which then brought the entire show to US audiences.\n\nIn 1975, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] broadcast two 90-minute ''Monty Python'' specials, each with three shows, but cut out a total of 24 minutes from each, in part to make time for commercials, and in part to avoid upsetting their audience.  As the judge observed in ''[[Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.]]'', where Monty Python sued for damages caused by broadcast of the mutilated version, \"According to the network, appellants should have anticipated that most of the excised material contained scatological references inappropriate for American television and that these scenes would be replaced with commercials, which presumably are more palatable to the American public.\"  Monty Python won the case.<ref>{{cite web|ref=harv|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/integrity/Links/Cases/gilliam.html|title=Terry Gilliam et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants-Appellees, v.

''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' was based on [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]] and was directed by Jones and Gilliam. Again, the latter also contributed linking animations (and put together the opening credits). Along with the rest of the Pythons, Jones and Gilliam performed several roles in the film, but Chapman took the lead as King Arthur. Cleese returned to the group for the film, feeling that they were once again breaking new ground. ''Holy Grail'' was filmed on location, in picturesque rural areas of Scotland, with a budget of only \u00a3229,000; the money was raised in part with investments from rock groups such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], and [[Led Zeppelin]], as well as UK music industry entrepreneur [[Tony Stratton-Smith]] (founder and owner of the [[Charisma Records]] label, for which the Pythons recorded their comedy albums).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-05-06/entertainment/0905050391_1_holy-grail-monty-python-john-goldstone|title=Cue the coconuts: 'Holy Grail' gallops on|last=Johnson|first=Steve|date=6 May 2009|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe backers of the film wanted to cut the famous [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|Black Knight]] scene (a [[Sam Peckinpah]] send-up in which the Black Knight loses his limbs in a duel), but it was eventually kept in the movie.<ref>Interview with John Cleese on Q-The Podcast with host John Ghomeshi, on 16 July 2009</ref> \"Tis but a scratch\" and \"It's just a flesh wound\u2026\" are often quoted.<ref name=\"Python quotes\">{{cite news |title=49 of Monty Python's most absurdly funny jokes and quotes |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/read-this/49-of-monty-pythons-most-absurdly-funny-jokes-and-quotes/ |accessdate=18 August 2019 |work=Yorkshire Post}}</ref> ''Holy Grail'' was selected as the second-best comedy of all time in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] special ''[[Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time]]''. and viewers in a [[Channel 4]] poll placed it sixth.<ref name=\"Channel4 comedies\"/>\n\n====''Monty Python's Life of Brian'' (1979)====\n{{Main|Monty Python's Life of Brian}}\nFollowing the success of ''Holy Grail'', reporters asked for the title of the next Python film, despite the fact that the team had not even begun to consider a third one.

Despite sharing a distrust of organised religion, they agreed not to mock Jesus or his teachings directly. They also mentioned that they could not think of anything legitimate to make fun of about him.<ref name=\"theologian\"/> Instead, they decided to write a satire on credulity and hypocrisy among the followers of someone [Brian] who had been mistaken for the \"Messiah\", but who had no desire to be followed as such.<ref name=\"TJones\"/> Terry Jones adds it was a satire on those who for the next 2,000 years \"couldn't agree on what Jesus was saying about peace and love\".<ref name=\"TJones\"/>\n\n{{quote box|width=30%|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"We are three wise men.\"<br />\n\"Well, what are you doing creeping around a cow shed at two o'clock in the morning?

Under his helm, though, the segment grew so ambitious and tangential that it was cut from the movie and used as a supporting feature in its own right. (Television screenings also use it as a prologue.) This was the last project on which all six Pythons collaborated, except for the 1989 compilation ''[[Parrot Sketch Not Included \u2013 20 Years of Monty Python|Parrot Sketch Not Included]],'' where they are all seen sitting in a closet for four seconds.

The memoir ''A Liar's Autobiography'' was published in 1980 and details Chapman's journey through medical school, alcoholism, acknowledgement of his gay identity, and the tolls of surreal comedy. Asked what was true in a deliberately fanciful account by Chapman of his life, Terry Jones joked: \"Nothing&nbsp;... it's all a downright, absolute, blackguardly lie.\" The film uses Chapman's own voice\u2014from a reading of his autobiography shortly before he died of cancer\u2014and entertainment channel [[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]] announced the film's release in early 2012 in both 2D and 3D formats.

That left two in their own corners: Gilliam, operating solo due to the nature of his work, and [[Eric Idle]]. Regular themes in Idle's contributions were elaborate [[wordplay]] and musical numbers. After ''Flying Circus'', he hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' four times in the first five seasons. Idle's initially successful solo career faltered in the 1990s with the failures of his 1993 film ''[[Splitting Heirs]]'' (written, produced by, and starring him) and 1998's ''[[An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn]]'' (in which he starred). He revived his career by returning to the source of his worldwide fame, adapting Monty Python material for other media. Idle wrote the [[Tony Award]]-winning musical ''[[Spamalot]]'', based on ''Holy Grail''. Following the success of the musical he wrote ''[[Not the Messiah (He's a Very Naughty Boy)|Not the Messiah]]'', an [[oratorio]] derived from the ''Life of Brian''.<ref>Eric Idle, [Email letter to] \"The Pythons,\" 20 December 2006.

Jones had a lead role in maintaining the group's unity and creative independence. Python biographer George Perry has commented that should \"[you] speak to him on subjects as diverse as [[fossil fuel]]s, or [[Rupert Bear]], or mercenaries in the [[Middle Ages]] or Modern China&nbsp;... in a moment you will find yourself hopelessly out of your depth, floored by his knowledge.\"<ref>Perry, George (2007). ''The Life of Python''. p. 40. Pavilion</ref> Many others agree that Jones is characterised by his irrepressible, good-natured enthusiasm. However, Jones' passion often led to prolonged arguments with other group members\u2014in particular Cleese\u2014with Jones often unwilling to back down. Since his major contributions were largely behind the scenes (direction, writing), and he often deferred to the other members of the group as an actor, Jones' importance to Python was often under-rated. However, he does have the legacy of delivering possibly the most famous line in all of Python, as Brian's mother Mandy in ''Life of Brian'', \"He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!\", a line voted the funniest in film history on two occasions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,2131880,00.html|title=The last laugh: your favourite 50|work=The Observer|location=UK|first1=Philip|last1=French|first2=Mark|last2=Kermode|first3=Jason|last3=Solomons|first4=Akin|last4=Ojumu|first5=Killian|last5=Fox|date=22 July 2007|accessdate=21 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1385293/Life-of-Brian-wins-the-vote-for-film's-best-laughter-line.html|title=Life of Brian wins the vote for film's best laughter line|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Sarah|last=Womack|date=19 February 2002|accessdate=21 September 2008|location=London}}</ref> Jones died on 21 January 2020 from complications of dementia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python star Terry Jones dies aged 77 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51209197 |accessdate=22 January 2020 |work=BBC News |date=22 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Palin|Sir Michael Palin]] attended [[Oxford University|Oxford]], where he met his Python writing partner Jones. The two also wrote the series ''Ripping Yarns'' together. Palin and Jones originally wrote face-to-face, but soon found it was more productive to write apart and then come together to review what the other had written. Therefore, Jones and Palin's sketches tended to be more focused than that of the others, taking one bizarre situation, sticking to it, and building on it. After ''Flying Circus'', Palin hosted ''Saturday Night Live'' four times in the first 10 seasons. His comedy output began to decrease in amount following the increasing success of his travel documentaries for the BBC. Palin released a book of diaries from the Python years entitled ''Michael Palin Diaries 1969\u20131979'', published in 2007.

By 2005, a falling out had occurred between Idle and Innes over additional Rutles projects, the results being Innes' critically acclaimed Rutles \"reunion\" album ''The Rutles: Archaeology'' and Idle's straight-to-DVD ''The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch'', each undertaken without the other's participation.

Secondly, at the beginning of \"Mr. Neutron\", Adams is dressed in a \"pepperpot\" outfit and loads a missile onto a cart being driven by Terry Jones, who is calling out for scrap metal (\"Any old iron&nbsp;...\").

He appeared in the first two series of the show, and played over 10 roles. While Davidson is primarily known as a scriptwriter, it is not known if he had any contribution toward the writing of the sketches, as he is only credited as a performer. In total, Davidson is credited as appearing in eight episodes of the show, which is more than any other male actor who was not a Python.

Izzard hosted ''The Life of Python'' (1999), a history of the group that was part of Python Night and appeared with them at a festival/tribute in [[Aspen, Colorado]], in 1998 (released on DVD as ''Live at Aspen'').

{"title_page": "Divorce law by country", "text_new": "This article is a general overview of [[divorce]] laws around the world. Every nation in the world allows its residents to divorce under some conditions except the [[Philippines]] (though [[Muslims in the Philippines]] have the right to divorce) and the [[Vatican City]], an ecclesiastical sovereign city-state, which has no procedure for divorce. In these two countries, laws only allow [[annulment]] of marriages.\n\n== Muslim societies ==\n{{main|Divorce in Islam}}\n\nIn the  [[Muslim world]], legislation concerning divorce varies from country to country. Different Muslim scholars can have slightly differing interpretations of divorce in Islam.\n\n[[No-fault divorce]] is allowed in Muslim societies, although normally only with the consent of the husband ([[talaq]]). If the wife wants to divorce ([[khul']]), she must go to a court, providing evidence of her husband's ill treatment, his inability to sustain her financially, his sexual impotence, or her dislike of his looks. The husband may be given time to fix the problem, but if he fails, the judge will grant the divorce.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/askaboutislam/display.asp?hquestionID=3202|title=Laws of divorce|accessdate=2006-09-19|author=Amani Aboul Fadl Farag|publisher=islamonline.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050731074113/http://www.islamonline.net/askaboutislam/display.asp?hquestionID=3202|archivedate=2005-07-31|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Argentina==\nIn [[Argentina]], the legalisation of divorce was the result of a struggle between different governments and conservative groups, mostly connected to the [[Catholic Church]].\n\nIn 1888, the Law 2,393 provided that marriage and divorce in Argentina be governed by the State, instead of the Church. The divorce consisted only in the personal separation of the spouses, without dissolving the marriage. The divorced were not authorized to a new marriage and in order to obtain a divorce it was to be approved by a judicial order. The causes in which it was allowed were adultery, insults, violence, or abandonment.\n\nOnly in 1954, President [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]], who was -at that time- in conflict with the Church, had the Law 14,394 passed for the first time in the country which admitted that divorcees could marry again.

Before that time, the process for getting a divorce varied from province to province. In Newfoundland and Quebec, it was necessary to get a private Act of Parliament in order to end a marriage. Most other provinces incorporated the English [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857|''Matrimonial Causes Act'' of 1857]] which allowed a husband to get a divorce on the grounds of his wife's adultery and a wife to get one only if she established that her husband committed any of a list of particular sexual behaviours but not simply adultery. Some provinces had legislation allowing either spouse to get a divorce on the basis of adultery.\n\nThe federal ''[[Divorce Act (Canada)|Divorce Act]]'' of 1968 standardized the law of divorce across Canada and introduced the no-fault concept of permanent marriage breakdown as a ground for divorce as well as fault-based grounds including adultery, cruelty and desertion.<ref>\n {{cite web|url=http://dsp-psd.communication.gc.ca/Pilot/LoPBdP/CIR/963-e.htm |title=Divorce law in Canada |accessdate=2007-03-28 |last=Douglas |first=Kirsten |date=27 March 2001 |publisher=Law and Government Division, Department of Justice, Government of Canada |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401063443/http://dsp-psd.communication.gc.ca/Pilot/LoPBdP/CIR/963-e.htm |archivedate=April 1, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Canada]], while [[civil and political rights]] are in the [[jurisdiction]] of the [[provinces]], the [[Constitution of Canada]] specifically made marriage and divorce the realm of the [[Government of Canada|federal government]]. Essentially this means that Canada's divorce law is uniform throughout Canada, even in [[Quebec]], which differs from the other provinces in its use of the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] as [[Codification (law)|codified]] in the [[Civil Code of Quebec]] as opposed to the [[common law]] that is in force in the other provinces and generally interpreted in similar ways throughout the Anglo-Canadian provinces. The law for division of property and debt, however, are within the jurisdiction of each province or territory, creating a structure where both provincial and federal laws will apply in the majority of claims for divorce.\n\nThe Canada Divorce Act recognizes divorce only on the ground of breakdown of the marriage. Breakdown can only be established if one of three grounds hold: [[adultery]], cruelty, and being separated for one year. Most divorces proceed on the basis of the spouses being separated for one year, even if there has been cruelty or adultery.\n\nThe one-year period of separation starts from the time at least one spouse intends to live separate and apart from the other and acts on it. A couple does not need a court order to be separated, since there is no such thing as a \"[[legal separation]]\" in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Divorce and Separation|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/fl-df/divorce/sd.html|website=Department of Justice|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=18 November 2017|date=1 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nA couple can even be considered to be \"separated\" even if they are living in the same dwelling.

The parties need to reach also agreement on post-divorce child care, dificions of common property, housing and possibly also alimony.

It was subsequently modified in 1793 and 1794, and eventually incorporated in the [[Civil code]] It was repealed on 8 May 1816, due mainly to the Catholic church, after the restoration of the Bourbon kings.

Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains are governed by the Hindu Marriage Act 1955, Christians are governed by The Divorce Act 1869, Parsis by the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act 1936, Muslims by the [[Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939]] and Inter-religious marriages are governed by The Special Marriage Act 1954.\n\nConditions are laid down to perform a marriage between a man and woman by these laws.

However, in 1995, a [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|second amendment]] was approved by referendum with 50.3% in favour to allow divorce in circumstances where a couple had been separated for four out of the preceding five years, and proper provision is made for both spouses and any children. Divorce law is governed by the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.

Higgins signed into law the Family Law Act 2019 which amended the 1996 Divorce Act by shortening the period of separation from four years to two years and reduced waiting period, which occurs after the divorce is filed, from five years to three years.

An abrogative  [[1974 Italian divorce referendum|referendum]] supported by Catholic organizations and by the Vatican was defeated on 12 May 1974. A constitutional issue had been also raised with regard to Italy's obligations under the [[Lateran Treaty]], entered into in 1929, on whether it prohibited Italy from authorizing divorce. Before 1970, there was no provision for divorce in Italian law, and the difficulty of ridding oneself of an unwanted spouse in the absence of any legal way to do so was a frequent topic of drama and humor, reaching its apotheosis in the 1961 film ''[[Divorce, Italian Style]]''.\n\nIn Italy, almost all divorces are granted on the ground of legal separation. In 2015, the period of legal separation necessary for divorce was reduced to one year in the cases of contested separation and to six months in the cases of consensual separation (previously, five years from 1970 and three years from 1987),<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/23/us-italy-divorce-idUSKBN0NE1JD20150423 | work=Reuters | title='Divorce Italian style' becomes easier, faster with new law | date=2015-04-23}}</ref> since the comparition of the spouses at the first [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] in the separation procedure or since the date of the separation agreement. A separation decree may be granted when there are facts that would render the continuation of married life intolerable or have a serious and damaging impact on the upbringing of the children. Separation may also be granted by mutual consent. Separation by mutual consent and uncontested divorce are also possible without judicial procedure.\n\nDivorce may be granted without a previous legal separation only in very rare cases (e.g. final criminal conviction, annulment or divorce obtained abroad by the foreign spouse, unconsummated marriage, sex change).\n\n== Japan ==\nIn [[Japan]], there are four types of divorce: Divorce by Mutual Consent, Divorce by Family Court Mediation, Divorce by [[Family court]] Judgement, and Divorce by [[District Courts in Japan|District Court]] Judgment.<ref name=\"crndivorce\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crnjapan.com/divorce/en/types_of_divorce_in_japan.html|title=Types of Divorce In Japan|accessdate=2007-06-18|author=Japan Children's Rights Network}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nDivorce by mutual consent is a simple process of submitting a declaration to the relevant government office that says both spouses agree to divorce. This form is often called the \"Green Form\" due to the wide green band across the top. If both parties fail to reach agreement on conditions of a Divorce By Mutual Consent, such as child custody which must be specified on the divorce form, then they must use one of the other three types of divorce. Foreign divorces may also be registered in Japan by bringing the appropriate court documents to the local city hall along with a copy of the Family Registration of the Japanese ex-spouse. If an international divorce includes joint custody of the children, it is important to the foreign parent to register it, because joint custody is not legal in Japan. The parent to register the divorce may thus be granted sole custody of the child according to Japanese law.\n\nDivorce by Mutual Consent in Japan differs from divorce in many other countries, causing it to not be recognized by all countries. It does not require the oversight by courts intended in many countries to ensure an equitable dissolution to both parties. Further, it is not always possible to verify the identity of the non Japanese spouse in the case of an international divorce. This is due to two facts. First, both spouses do not have to be present when submitting the divorce form to the government office. Second, a Japanese citizen must authorize the divorce form using a personal stamp (hanko), and Japan has a legal mechanism for registration of personal stamps. On the other hand, a non-Japanese citizen can authorize the divorce form with a signature. But there is no such legal registry for signatures, making forgery of the signature of a non-Japanese spouse difficult to prevent at best, and impossible to prevent without foresight. The only defense against such forgery is, before the forgery occurs, to submit another form to prevent a divorce form from being legally accepted by the government office at all. This form must be renewed every six months.\n\n==Malta==\nDespite [[civil marriage]] being introduced in 1975, no provision was made for divorce except for the recognition of divorces granted by foreign courts. Legislation introducing divorce came into effect in October 2011 following the result of a [[Maltese divorce referendum, 2011|referendum on the subject]] earlier in the year.

The law provides for [[no-fault divorce]] based on the [[irretrievable breakdown]] of the marital relationship. The courts may accept any relevant evidence, but the law specifically mentions one year's separation, adultery, and [[habitual criminal]]ity as factors which may prove irretrievable breakdown. A divorce may also be obtained on the grounds of incurable [[mental illness]] for two years, or continuous unconsciousness for six months.\n\nDivorce cases are heard in the [[High Courts of South Africa|High Courts]] or, since 2010, in the regional civil [[Magistrates' Court (South Africa)|magistrates' courts]]. A court has the jurisdiction to hear a divorce if either of the spouses is [[Domicile (law)|legally domiciled]] within the geographical jurisdiction of the court, or if either spouse is \"ordinarily resident\" (i.e. normally lives in) the jurisdiction and has been ordinarily resident in South Africa for at least a year.\n\n[[Divorce of same-sex couples]] is subject to the same law as divorce of opposite-sex couples. Divorce for marriages under [[Customary law in South Africa|customary law]] is also subject to the civil law, with certain modifications to account for the fact that customary marriages may be [[polygyny|polygynous]].\n\nShould the divorcees have children, it is necessary to compile a parenting plan which must be signed off by the family advocate.\n\n== Sweden ==\n{{Main|Divorce law in Sweden}}\nTo divorce in Sweden the couple can file for divorce together or one party can file alone. If they have children under 16 living at home or one party does not wish to get divorced there is a required contemplation period of 6 to 12 months. During this period they stay married and the request must be confirmed after the waiting period for the divorce to go through.<ref name=\"domstol.se\">{{cite web|url=http://www.domstol.se/templates/DV_InfoPage____2413.aspx|title=Divorce|date=2007-03-07|publisher=Sveriges Domstolar - Domstolsverket, Swedish National Courts Administration|accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom== <!-- Courtesy note [[Albert Haddock]], a pseudonym of [[Alan Herbert]], links here -->\n\n===England and Wales===\n{{Hatnote|See: [[Divorce in England and Wales]]}}\n\n===Scotland===\n{{Hatnote|See: [[Divorce in Scotland]]}}\n\n== United States ==\n{{main|Divorce in the United States}}\nDivorce in the United States is a matter of [[State law (United States)|state]] rather than [[federal law]]. In recent years, however, more federal legislation has been enacted affecting the rights and responsibilities of divorcing spouses. The laws of the state(s) of residence at the time of divorce govern; all states recognize divorces granted by any other state through the principle of [[comity]], [[Full faith and credit|enshrined in Article IV]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Divorce: Scope of Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Federal Constitution|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=1906|volume=15|issue=8|pages=426\u2013428|jstor=785616}}</ref> All states impose a minimum time of residence in the state. Typically, a county court's family division judges petitions for dissolution of marriages.\n\nBefore the latter decades of the 20th century, a spouse seeking divorce had to show cause and even then might not be able to obtain a divorce. The legalization of [[no-fault divorce]] in the United States began in 1969 in California, pursuant to legislation signed by then-Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] and was completed in 2010, with [[New York (state)|New York]] being the last of the fifty states to legalize it.<ref>{{cite news|author=AP |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ny_last_state_to_recognize_no_fault_mzWXGD1R94ZxX6c85MjOWI |title=New York becomes last state to recognize 'no fault' divorces |publisher=NYPOST.com |date=2010-08-16 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Lovett|first1=Kenneth|last2=Blain|first2=Glenn|title=New York legislators approve no-fault divorce|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-york-legislators-approve-no-fault-divorce-gov-paterson-sign-bill-ease-splits-article-1.467517|accessdate=18 November 2017|publisher=New York Daily News|date=1 July 2010}}</ref> However, some states still require some waiting period before a divorce, typically a 1\u2013 to 2\u2013year separation. Fault grounds, when available, are sometimes still sought. This may be done where it reduces the waiting period otherwise required, or possibly in hopes of affecting decisions related to a divorce, such as child custody, child support, division of marital assets, or [[alimony]]. Since the mid-1990s, a few states have enacted [[covenant marriage]] laws, which allow couples to voluntarily make a divorce more difficult for themselves to obtain than in the typical no-fault divorce action.\n\n[[Mediation]] is a growing way of resolving divorce issues. It tends to be less adversarial (particularly important for any children), more private, less expensive, and faster than traditional litigation.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Hoffman \n |first=David A. \n |author2=Karen Tosh \n |year=1999 \n |title=Coaching From The Sidelines: Effective Advocacy In Divorce Mediation \n |journal=Massachusetts Family Law Journal \n |volume=85 \n |url=http://bostonlawcollaborative.com/documents/2005-07-coaching-from-the-sidelines.pdf \n |format=PDF \n |accessdate=2006-09-10 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822072744/http://bostonlawcollaborative.com/documents/2005-07-coaching-from-the-sidelines.pdf \n |archivedate=2006-08-22 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref> Similar in concept, but with more support than mediation, is [[collaborative divorce]], where both sides are represented by attorneys but commit to negotiating a settlement without engaging in litigation. Some believe that mediation may not be appropriate for all relationships, especially those that included physical or emotional abuse, or an imbalance of power and knowledge about the parties' finances.\n\nStates vary in their rules for division of assets. Some states are \"[[community property]]\" states, others are \"[[equitable distribution]]\" states, and others have elements of both. Most \"community property\" states start with the presumption that community assets will be divided equally, whereas \"equitable distribution\" states presume fairness may dictate more or less than half of the assets will be awarded to one spouse or the other. Commonly, assets acquired before marriage are considered the property of the individual and not marital property. and assets acquired after, marital. Attempt is made to assure the welfare of any minor children generally through their dependency. [[Alimony]], also known as \"maintenance\" or \"spousal support\", is still being granted in many cases, especially in longer-term marriages.\n\nA decree of divorce will generally not be granted until all questions regarding child care and custody, division of property and assets, and ongoing financial support are resolved.\n\nDue to the complex or onerous divorce requirements in many places, some people seek divorces from other jurisdictions that have easier and faster processes. Most of these places are commonly referred to negatively as \"[[divorce mill]]s.\" [[Reno, Nevada]] was for many years the iconic example of a US divorce mill.<ref>''From Contract to Covenant'', Margaret F. Brinig, p. 209</ref>\n\nWhere people from different countries get married, and one or both then choose to reside in another country, the procedures for divorce can become significantly more complicated. Although most countries make divorce possible, the form of settlement or agreement following divorce may be very different depending on where the divorce takes place.\n\nIn some countries there may be a bias towards the man regarding property settlements, and in others there may be a bias towards the woman concerning property and custody of any children. One or both parties may seek to divorce in a country that has jurisdiction over them. Normally there will be a residence requirement in the country in which the divorce takes place. See also [[Divorce#Divorces obtained by US couples in a different country or jurisdiction|Divorces obtained by US couples in a different country or jurisdiction]] above for more information, as applicable globally. In the case of disputed custody, almost all lawyers would strongly advise following the jurisdiction applicable to the dispute, i.e. the country or state of the spouse's residence. Even if not disputed, the spouse could later dispute it and potentially invalidate another jurisdiction's ruling.\n\nSome of the more important aspects of divorce law involve the provisions for any children involved in the marriage, and problems may arise due to [[child abduction|abduction]] of children by one parent, or restriction of [[contact (law)|contact]] rights to children. For the [[conflict of Laws]] issues, see [[divorce (conflict)]].\n\nCourts in the United States currently recognize two types of divorce: [[absolute divorce]], known as \"divorce a vinculo matrimonii\", and [[limited divorce]], known as \"divorce a menso et thoro\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/divorce|title=Divorce|work=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Amato, Paul R. and Alan Booth.

The divorce consisted only in the personal separation of the spouses, without dissolving the marriage. The divorced were not authorized to a new marriage and in order to obtain a divorce it was to be approved by a judicial order. The causes in which it was allowed were adultery, insults, violence, or abandonment.\n\nOnly in 1954, President [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]], who was -at that time- in conflict with the Church, had the Law 14,394 passed for the first time in the country which admitted that divorcees could marry again. But Per\u00f3n was forced out of the presidency one year later by a [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora|military coup]], and the government that succeeded him, abolished the law.\n\nSince 1968 there was no need to prove the guilt of any of the parterns, but remarrying after a divorce was still banned.\n\nFinally, in 1987, President [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]] was successful in passing the divorce law (Law 23,515), following a ruling of the [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Supreme Court]]. The new law also provided for [[gender equality]] between the wife and husband.<ref>''Sex and the State: Abortion, Divorce, and the Family Under Latin.

Before that time, the process for getting a divorce varied from province to province. In Newfoundland and Quebec, it was necessary to get a private Act of Parliament in order to end a marriage. Most other provinces incorporated the English [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857|''Matrimonial Causes Act'' of 1857]] which allowed a husband to get a divorce on the grounds of his wife's adultery and a wife to get one only if she established that her husband committed any of a list of particular sexual behaviours but not simply adultery. Some provinces had legislation allowing either spouse to get a divorce on the basis of adultery.\n\nThe federal ''[[Divorce Act (Canada)|Divorce Act]]'' of 1968 standardized the law of divorce across Canada and introduced the no-fault concept of permanent marriage breakdown as a ground for divorce as well as fault-based grounds including adultery, cruelty and desertion.<ref>\n {{cite web|url=http://dsp-psd.communication.gc.ca/Pilot/LoPBdP/CIR/963-e.htm |title=Divorce law in Canada |accessdate=2007-03-28 |last=Douglas |first=Kirsten |date=27 March 2001 |publisher=Law and Government Division, Department of Justice, Government of Canada |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401063443/http://dsp-psd.communication.gc.ca/Pilot/LoPBdP/CIR/963-e.htm |archivedate=April 1, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Canada]], while [[civil and political rights]] are in the [[jurisdiction]] of the [[provinces]], the [[Constitution of Canada]] specifically made marriage and divorce the realm of the [[Government of Canada|federal government]]. Essentially this means that Canada's divorce law is uniform throughout Canada, even in [[Quebec]], which differs from the other provinces in its use of the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] as [[Codification (law)|codified]] in the [[Civil Code of Quebec]] as opposed to the [[common law]] that is in force in the other provinces and generally interpreted in similar ways throughout the Anglo-Canadian provinces. The law for division of property and debt, however, are within the jurisdiction of each province or territory, creating a structure where both provincial and federal laws will apply in the majority of claims for divorce.\n\nThe Canada Divorce Act recognizes divorce only on the ground of breakdown of the marriage. Breakdown can only be established if one of three grounds hold: [[adultery]], cruelty, and being separated for one year. Most divorces proceed on the basis of the spouses being separated for one year, even if there has been cruelty or adultery.\n\nThe one-year period of separation starts from the time at least one spouse intends to live separate and apart from the other and acts on it. A couple does not need a court order to be separated, since there is no such thing as a \"[[legal separation]]\" in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Divorce and Separation|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/fl-df/divorce/sd.html|website=Department of Justice|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=18 November 2017|date=1 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nA couple can even be considered to be \"separated\" even if they are living in the same dwelling.

Sometimes, when people say they are legally separated, they mean that they have entered into a legally binding agreement, sometimes called a Separation Agreement, a Divorce Agreement, a Custody, Access and Property Agreement, or a Minutes of Settlement. These types of agreements are usually prepared by lawyers, signed in front of witnesses, and legal advice is given to both parties signing the agreement. However, these types of agreements will, in most cases, be upheld by the courts.[http://www.albertacourts.ab.ca/ProvincialCourt/FamilyJusticeServices/FamilyLawInformationCentres/CommonQuestions/tabid/139/Default.aspx]\n\n== Chile ==\nChile legalized [[divorce]] in 2004, overturning an 1884 legal code.<ref name=\"bbc divorce\">{{cite news|title=Chile introduces right to divorce|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4021427.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=November 18, 2004}}</ref> The law that legalized divorce is called the ''Nueva Ley de Matrimonio Civil'' (\"New Civil Marriage Law\"), and was first introduced as a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] in 1995; there had been previous divorce bills before, but this one managed to secure enough conservative and liberal support to pass.<ref name=haas>{{cite book|last=Haas|first=Liesl|title=Feminist Policymaking in Chile|year=2010|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pennsylvania|isbn=978-0-271-03746-2}}</ref> Under the new law, couples must be separated for a year before divorcing if the split is mutual, and three years if the split is not mutual.<ref name=\"bbc2\">{{cite news | title = Chileans granted right to divorce | date = May 7, 2004 | publisher = [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3693627.stm | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}</ref>\n\nThe four marital statuses that exist within Chile are married, separated, divorced, and widow(er).

Amicable divorce is done by court judgement that approves divorce agreement between the parties. Several preconditions must be met: the marriage must have lasted for at least a year and the couple does not form a family unit for at least six months. The parties need to reach also agreement on post-divorce child care, dificions of common property, housing and possibly also alimony. Contentious divorce takes place when the parties cannot reach agreement.

It was subsequently modified in 1793 and 1794, and eventually incorporated in the [[Civil code]] It was repealed on 8 May 1816, due mainly to the Catholic church, after the restoration of the Bourbon kings.

Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains are governed by the Hindu Marriage Act 1955, Christians are governed by The Divorce Act 1869, Parsis by the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act 1936, Muslims by the [[Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939]] and Inter-religious marriages are governed by The Special Marriage Act 1954.\n\nConditions are laid down to perform a marriage between a man and woman by these laws.

An [[Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1986|amendment]] to allow divorce under specified circumstances was rejected with 63.5% against in a referendum in 1986. However, in 1995, a [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|second amendment]] was approved by referendum with 50.3% in favour to allow divorce in circumstances where a couple had been separated for four out of the preceding five years, and proper provision is made for both spouses and any children. Divorce law is governed by the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996. This law was later amended in 2019 by a further [[Thirty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|third amendment]] and the subsequent Family Law Act 2019.<ref name=referendumlaw>https://www.buzz.ie/news/the-divorce-bill-has-officially-been-signed-into-law-today-329060</ref> It is possible to be considered separated while living under the same roof.<ref>''McA v McA'' [2000] 2 ILRM 48.</ref>\n\nDivorces obtained outside Ireland are only recognised by the State if either:\n* at least one of the spouses was domiciled within the [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] which issued the decree of divorce at the time of issue, or\n* the state is required to recognise the divorce pursuant to the relevant [[European Union]] [[regulation (European Union)|regulation]]s \u2014 currently ''Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility''.\n*Following a national referendum held on 24 May 2019 on amending Ireland's restrictive divorce laws (in force since 1995), the four-year waiting time for a divorce was removed from the constitution by a c.82% majority of voters. The legislature will be thus enabled to write into Irish law a much-reduced waiting period required to obtain a divorce. \n*Following the same referendum legislators will also be enabled to write into Irish law an easing of restrictions in recognising divorces obtained in other jurisdictions\n*In October 2019, Irish President Michael D. Higgins signed into law the Family Law Act 2019 which amended the 1996 Divorce Act by shortening the period of separation from four years to two years and reduced waiting period, which occurs after the divorce is filed, from five years to three years.

An abrogative  [[1974 Italian divorce referendum|referendum]] supported by Catholic organizations and by the Vatican was defeated on 12 May 1974. A constitutional issue had been also raised with regard to Italy's obligations under the [[Lateran Treaty]], entered into in 1929, on whether it prohibited Italy from authorizing divorce. Before 1970, there was no provision for divorce in Italian law, and the difficulty of ridding oneself of an unwanted spouse in the absence of any legal way to do so was a frequent topic of drama and humor, reaching its apotheosis in the 1961 film ''[[Divorce, Italian Style]]''.\n\nIn Italy, almost all divorces are granted on the ground of legal separation. In 2015, the period of legal separation necessary for divorce was reduced to one year in the cases of contested separation and to six months in the cases of consensual separation (previously, five years from 1970 and three years from 1987),<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/23/us-italy-divorce-idUSKBN0NE1JD20150423 | work=Reuters | title='Divorce Italian style' becomes easier, faster with new law | date=2015-04-23}}</ref> since the comparition of the spouses at the first [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] in the separation procedure or since the date of the separation agreement. A separation decree may be granted when there are facts that would render the continuation of married life intolerable or have a serious and damaging impact on the upbringing of the children. Separation may also be granted by mutual consent. Separation by mutual consent and uncontested divorce are also possible without judicial procedure.\n\nDivorce may be granted without a previous legal separation only in very rare cases (e.g. final criminal conviction, annulment or divorce obtained abroad by the foreign spouse, unconsummated marriage, sex change).\n\n== Japan ==\nIn [[Japan]], there are four types of divorce: Divorce by Mutual Consent, Divorce by Family Court Mediation, Divorce by [[Family court]] Judgement, and Divorce by [[District Courts in Japan|District Court]] Judgment.<ref name=\"crndivorce\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crnjapan.com/divorce/en/types_of_divorce_in_japan.html|title=Types of Divorce In Japan|accessdate=2007-06-18|author=Japan Children's Rights Network}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nDivorce by mutual consent is a simple process of submitting a declaration to the relevant government office that says both spouses agree to divorce. This form is often called the \"Green Form\" due to the wide green band across the top. If both parties fail to reach agreement on conditions of a Divorce By Mutual Consent, such as child custody which must be specified on the divorce form, then they must use one of the other three types of divorce. Foreign divorces may also be registered in Japan by bringing the appropriate court documents to the local city hall along with a copy of the Family Registration of the Japanese ex-spouse. If an international divorce includes joint custody of the children, it is important to the foreign parent to register it, because joint custody is not legal in Japan. The parent to register the divorce may thus be granted sole custody of the child according to Japanese law.\n\nDivorce by Mutual Consent in Japan differs from divorce in many other countries, causing it to not be recognized by all countries. It does not require the oversight by courts intended in many countries to ensure an equitable dissolution to both parties. Further, it is not always possible to verify the identity of the non Japanese spouse in the case of an international divorce. This is due to two facts. First, both spouses do not have to be present when submitting the divorce form to the government office. Second, a Japanese citizen must authorize the divorce form using a personal stamp (hanko), and Japan has a legal mechanism for registration of personal stamps. On the other hand, a non-Japanese citizen can authorize the divorce form with a signature. But there is no such legal registry for signatures, making forgery of the signature of a non-Japanese spouse difficult to prevent at best, and impossible to prevent without foresight. The only defense against such forgery is, before the forgery occurs, to submit another form to prevent a divorce form from being legally accepted by the government office at all. This form must be renewed every six months.\n\n==Malta==\nDespite [[civil marriage]] being introduced in 1975, no provision was made for divorce except for the recognition of divorces granted by foreign courts. Legislation introducing divorce came into effect in October 2011 following the result of a [[Maltese divorce referendum, 2011|referendum on the subject]] earlier in the year. It provides for [[no-fault divorce]], with the marriage being dissolved through a [[judgment (law)|Court judgement]] following the request of one of the parties, provided the couple has lived apart for at least four years out of the previous five and adequate [[alimony]] is being paid or is guaranteed.<ref>[http://www.doi-archived.gov.mt/EN/parliamentacts/2011/ACT%20XIV%20Civil%20Code,%202011%20-%20(Divorce).pdf]</ref> The same law made a number of important changes regarding alimony, notably through extending it to children born of marriage who are still in full-time education or are disabled and through protecting alimony even after the Court pronounces a divorce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110819/opinion/Divorce-and-maintenance.380840|title=Divorce and... maintenance|author=Allied Newspapers Ltd|work=Times of Malta}}</ref>\n\n==Norway==\nSee [[Divorce in Norway]]\n\n==Philippines==\nPhilippine law does not provide for divorce inside the country, and it remains the only UN-member state beside [[Vatican City]] without legal provision for divorce.

The law provides for [[no-fault divorce]] based on the [[irretrievable breakdown]] of the marital relationship. The courts may accept any relevant evidence, but the law specifically mentions one year's separation, adultery, and [[habitual criminal]]ity as factors which may prove irretrievable breakdown. A divorce may also be obtained on the grounds of incurable [[mental illness]] for two years, or continuous unconsciousness for six months.\n\nDivorce cases are heard in the [[High Courts of South Africa|High Courts]] or, since 2010, in the regional civil [[Magistrates' Court (South Africa)|magistrates' courts]]. A court has the jurisdiction to hear a divorce if either of the spouses is [[Domicile (law)|legally domiciled]] within the geographical jurisdiction of the court, or if either spouse is \"ordinarily resident\" (i.e. normally lives in) the jurisdiction and has been ordinarily resident in South Africa for at least a year.\n\n[[Divorce of same-sex couples]] is subject to the same law as divorce of opposite-sex couples. Divorce for marriages under [[Customary law in South Africa|customary law]] is also subject to the civil law, with certain modifications to account for the fact that customary marriages may be [[polygyny|polygynous]].\n\nShould the divorcees have children, it is necessary to compile a parenting plan which must be signed off by the family advocate.\n\n== Sweden ==\n{{Main|Divorce law in Sweden}}\nTo divorce in Sweden the couple can file for divorce together or one party can file alone.

This may be done where it reduces the waiting period otherwise required, or possibly in hopes of affecting decisions related to a divorce, such as child custody, child support, division of marital assets, or [[alimony]]. Since the mid-1990s, a few states have enacted [[covenant marriage]] laws, which allow couples to voluntarily make a divorce more difficult for themselves to obtain than in the typical no-fault divorce action.\n\n[[Mediation]] is a growing way of resolving divorce issues. It tends to be less adversarial (particularly important for any children), more private, less expensive, and faster than traditional litigation.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Hoffman \n |first=David A. \n |author2=Karen Tosh \n |year=1999 \n |title=Coaching From The Sidelines: Effective Advocacy In Divorce Mediation \n |journal=Massachusetts Family Law Journal \n |volume=85 \n |url=http://bostonlawcollaborative.com/documents/2005-07-coaching-from-the-sidelines.pdf \n |format=PDF \n |accessdate=2006-09-10 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822072744/http://bostonlawcollaborative.com/documents/2005-07-coaching-from-the-sidelines.pdf \n |archivedate=2006-08-22 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref> Similar in concept, but with more support than mediation, is [[collaborative divorce]], where both sides are represented by attorneys but commit to negotiating a settlement without engaging in litigation. Some believe that mediation may not be appropriate for all relationships, especially those that included physical or emotional abuse, or an imbalance of power and knowledge about the parties' finances.\n\nStates vary in their rules for division of assets. Some states are \"[[community property]]\" states, others are \"[[equitable distribution]]\" states, and others have elements of both. Most \"community property\" states start with the presumption that community assets will be divided equally, whereas \"equitable distribution\" states presume fairness may dictate more or less than half of the assets will be awarded to one spouse or the other. Commonly, assets acquired before marriage are considered the property of the individual and not marital property. and assets acquired after, marital. Attempt is made to assure the welfare of any minor children generally through their dependency. [[Alimony]], also known as \"maintenance\" or \"spousal support\", is still being granted in many cases, especially in longer-term marriages.\n\nA decree of divorce will generally not be granted until all questions regarding child care and custody, division of property and assets, and ongoing financial support are resolved.\n\nDue to the complex or onerous divorce requirements in many places, some people seek divorces from other jurisdictions that have easier and faster processes. Most of these places are commonly referred to negatively as \"[[divorce mill]]s.\" [[Reno, Nevada]] was for many years the iconic example of a US divorce mill.<ref>''From Contract to Covenant'', Margaret F. Brinig, p. 209</ref>\n\nWhere people from different countries get married, and one or both then choose to reside in another country, the procedures for divorce can become significantly more complicated. Although most countries make divorce possible, the form of settlement or agreement following divorce may be very different depending on where the divorce takes place.\n\nIn some countries there may be a bias towards the man regarding property settlements, and in others there may be a bias towards the woman concerning property and custody of any children. One or both parties may seek to divorce in a country that has jurisdiction over them. Normally there will be a residence requirement in the country in which the divorce takes place. See also [[Divorce#Divorces obtained by US couples in a different country or jurisdiction|Divorces obtained by US couples in a different country or jurisdiction]] above for more information, as applicable globally. In the case of disputed custody, almost all lawyers would strongly advise following the jurisdiction applicable to the dispute, i.e. the country or state of the spouse's residence. Even if not disputed, the spouse could later dispute it and potentially invalidate another jurisdiction's ruling.\n\nSome of the more important aspects of divorce law involve the provisions for any children involved in the marriage, and problems may arise due to [[child abduction|abduction]] of children by one parent, or restriction of [[contact (law)|contact]] rights to children. For the [[conflict of Laws]] issues, see [[divorce (conflict)]].\n\nCourts in the United States currently recognize two types of divorce: [[absolute divorce]], known as \"divorce a vinculo matrimonii\", and [[limited divorce]], known as \"divorce a menso et thoro\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/divorce|title=Divorce|work=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Amato, Paul R. and Alan Booth.
