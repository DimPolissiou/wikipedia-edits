After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the Texas Rangers for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in one's way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring the border resident. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area comprised between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and The United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for Tejanos. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be maintained inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012.

Indeed, cultural, ethnic, and religious differences between Anglos and Hispanics persisted in the decades after the Mexican War.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 36}}</ref> Although the episodes of ethnic violence were episodic,<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 133}}</ref> the historian Alonzo argues that \"Anglo superiority also served to rationalize the very common idea in Texas that it is no wrong to kill a Mexican and, worse still, that killing an ethnic Mexican was an act to be proud of.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 134}}</ref>\n\nIn his book about Gregorio Cortez's life, Am\u00e9rico Paredes highlights the role of the Texas Rangers division in exacerbating the cultural conflicts on the border due to their alleged violent methods.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|pages= 23-32}}</ref>. An antagonistic relationship between [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican-Americans]] has developed in Texas due to a cycle of revenge involving Bandit Gang, Texas Rangers and innocent [[Mexican-Americans]] collaterals victims.<ref>{{harvnb|Levario|2012|page= 18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 132}}</ref> However, the role of the Texas Rangers in discrimination is a subject of historical controversy. On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Sometime in this period, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting lang from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. And then Gregorio Cortez stood at the door with his pistol in his hand. The Major Sheriff fell dead at the feet of Gregorio Cortez, and it was in this way that Gregorio Cortez killed the first sheriff of many that he was to kill.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref>\nThe killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Escape to the Robledo ranch ===\n\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy,]] left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. At the Robledo residence, a couple of days past, authorities had found Cortez and thus begun the Battle of Belmont.\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville,]] close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his mare jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. Suspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio.\n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The fund, largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]], saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\" (ranchers).<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, many [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== Gonzales trial ====\nThe battle of the courts began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> waiting with anticipation to see Cortez sentenced to death. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. Though they originally claimed the murder to have been done by a Mrs. Robledo during the fight, Robledo was coaxed into testifying that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Sheriff of Gonzales County, Robert M. Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson. ''The Last Carousel''. New York, Seven Stories Press, 1997. </ref>. Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home, Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure, ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though Sanders later told the defense his story and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 91}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref>. The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death.\n\n==== Further legal battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. Legal proceedings transferred to [[Pleasanton, Texas]] where a rushed decision emprisoned Cortez for two years for [[horse theft]]. The court ruling was soon reversed.<ref>Brown 146</ref>\n\nThe criminalization of Cortez continued to [[Goliad, Texas]] where the jury could not agree on a sentence for Cortez with \"seven for first-degree murder, four for second-degree murder, and one for acquittal.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 93}}</ref> The trials soon went to [[Wharton County]], where it was dismissed almost immediately, and then to Corpus Christi where Cortez was tried April 25-30, 1904. The jury, consisting of twelve white farmers, found Cortez not guilty for the killing of Morris, as they understood he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />\n\nHowever, there was no celebration of the [[acquittal]], as soon thereafter, a court in [[Columbus, Texas]] found Cortez guilty for the murder of Sheriff Glover and sentenced him to life in prison <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, as the Columbus trial sentenced Cortez for Glover's murder assuming he had already killed Morris, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 94}}</ref> The defense's claim was denied by many witnesses, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] upheld the [[conviction]], and on Jan 1, 1905, Gregorio Cortez began his [[life sentence]] in the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]] for the murder of Sheriff Glover.<ref name= TexasAppeals>[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4148411/cortez-v-state/ Cortez v.

Glover, who was killed during the pursuit. Efforts to have Cortez pardoned began with his incarceration and finally succeeded in 1913 when Governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Oscar Colquitt]] issued him a conditional [[pardon]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> At long last, in July 1913, Governor Colquitt granted Gregorio an official pardon, and he was freed on July 14 of that year.\n\n== Post-prison life and death ==\n\nAfter his pardon in 1913, Cortez thanked those who helped secure his freedom, spent his later years in [[Nuevo Laredo, Mexico]], and joined the losing [[Victoriano Huerta|Huertist]] forces of the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> After being wounded in the war, Cortez began living with one of his sons in [[Manor, Texas]] then later resided in [[Anson, Texas]].<ref>Brown, 150</ref><ref name= Deutsch2012>[https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/19510/cfch_Deutsch_GregorioCortez.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Deutsch, James I. 2012. \"Gregorio Cortez.\" in Great Lives from History: Latinos.]</ref>.

In [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]'s book, ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', he recites eleven versions of ''El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez'' each sung by numerous ''guitarreros'' (guitarists) near the [[Mexican-American border]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 175}}</ref> Though each [[corrido]] had their own style, flair, or message wanting to be relayed, they all exaggerated the life of Cortez to transform him into a Mexican [[folk hero]].\n\n=== With His Pistol in His Hand ===\n\nThe life and legend of Gregorio Cortez were studied by the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in a doctoral thesis on corridos that was later published in a revised version by the University of Texas Press in 1958 under the title ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016}}</ref> Paredes's work is about the life of Cortez, his legend, the formal aspects and variants of the corrido, and the cultural significance reflected in these products. \n\nThe book is one of the most influential books in  [[Chicano]] cultural studies and has received wide recognition and outstanding success in the academic world.<ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks.

The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human. If you go too heavy on the racism, it makes it difficult to see them as people.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Juan Cortina]]\n* [[Joaquin Murietta]]\n* [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]\n* [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]\n* [[Manifest Destiny]]\n* [[Texas Ranger Division]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}} \n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation|last= Alonzo |first= A.

After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the Texas Rangers for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in one's way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring the border resident. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area comprised between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and The United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for Tejanos. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be maintained inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012. River of Hope: Forging Identity and Nation in the Rio Grande Borderlands. Duke University Press, Durham, NC, 2013;2012;.</ref> The vast majority of [[Mexican-Americans]] also suffered racial discrimination. Indeed, cultural, ethnic, and religious differences between Anglos and Hispanics persisted in the decades after the Mexican War.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 36}}</ref> Although the episodes of ethnic violence were episodic,<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 133}}</ref> the historian Alonzo argues that \"Anglo superiority also served to rationalize the very common idea in Texas that it is no wrong to kill a Mexican and, worse still, that killing an ethnic Mexican was an act to be proud of.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 134}}</ref>\n\nIn his book about Gregorio Cortez's life, Am\u00e9rico Paredes highlights the role of the Texas Rangers division in exacerbating the cultural conflicts on the border due to their alleged violent methods.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|pages= 23-32}}</ref>. An antagonistic relationship between [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican-Americans]] has developed in Texas due to a cycle of revenge involving Bandit Gang, Texas Rangers and innocent [[Mexican-Americans]] collaterals victims.<ref>{{harvnb|Levario|2012|page= 18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 132}}</ref> However, the role of the Texas Rangers in discrimination is a subject of historical controversy. On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Sometime in this period, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting lang from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. And then Gregorio Cortez stood at the door with his pistol in his hand. The Major Sheriff fell dead at the feet of Gregorio Cortez, and it was in this way that Gregorio Cortez killed the first sheriff of many that he was to kill.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref>\nThe killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Flight to the Robledo ranch ===\n\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy,]] left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. At the Robledo residence, a couple of days past, authorities had found Cortez and thus begun the Battle of Belmont.\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville,]] close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his mare jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. Suspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio.\n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The fund, largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]], saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\" (ranchers).<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, many [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== Gonzales trial ====\nThe battle of the courts began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> waiting with anticipation to see Cortez sentenced to death. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. Though they originally claimed the murder to have been done by a Mrs. Robledo during the fight, Robledo was coaxed into testifying that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Sheriff of Gonzales County, Robert M.

Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home, Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure, ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though Sanders later told the defense his story and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 91}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref>. The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death.\n\n==== Further legal battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. Legal proceedings transferred to [[Pleasanton, Texas]] where a rushed decision emprisoned Cortez for two years for [[horse theft]]. The court ruling was soon reversed.<ref>Brown 146</ref>\n\nThe criminalization of Cortez continued to [[Goliad, Texas]] where the jury could not agree on a sentence for Cortez with \"seven for first-degree murder, four for second-degree murder, and one for acquittal.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 93}}</ref> The trials soon went to [[Wharton County]], where it was dismissed almost immediately, and then to Corpus Christi where Cortez was tried April 25-30, 1904. The jury, consisting of twelve white farmers, found Cortez not guilty for the killing of Morris, as they understood he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />\n\nHowever, there was no celebration of the [[acquittal]], as soon thereafter, a court in [[Columbus, Texas]] found Cortez guilty for the murder of Sheriff Glover and sentenced him to life in prison <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, as the Columbus trial sentenced Cortez for Glover's murder assuming he had already killed Morris, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 94}}</ref> The defense's claim was denied by many witnesses, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] upheld the [[conviction]], and on Jan 1, 1905, Gregorio Cortez began his [[life sentence]] in the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]] for the murder of Sheriff Glover.<ref name= TexasAppeals>[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4148411/cortez-v-state/ Cortez v.

Glover, who was killed during the pursuit. Efforts to have Cortez pardoned began with his incarceration and finally succeeded in 1913 when Governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Oscar Colquitt]] issued him a conditional [[pardon]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> At long last, in July 1913, Governor Colquitt granted Gregorio an official pardon, and he was freed on July 14 of that year.\n\n== Post-prison life and death ==\n\nAfter his pardon in 1913, Cortez thanked those who helped secure his freedom, spent his later years in [[Nuevo Laredo, Mexico]], and joined the losing [[Victoriano Huerta|Huertist]] forces of the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> After being wounded in the war, Cortez began living with one of his sons in [[Manor, Texas]] then later resided in [[Anson, Texas]].<ref>Brown, 150</ref><ref name= Deutsch2012>[https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/19510/cfch_Deutsch_GregorioCortez.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Deutsch, James I. 2012. \"Gregorio Cortez.\" in Great Lives from History: Latinos.]</ref>. Then on February 28, 1916, having been recently married for the third time to an assumed Esther Mart\u00ednez, Cortez died suddenly at the age of 40.<ref name=\"orozco\" /><ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />\n\nTo this day, the [[cause of death]] of Cortez is contested.

In [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]'s book, ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', he recites eleven versions of ''El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez'' each sung by numerous ''guitarreros'' (guitarists) near the [[Mexican-American border]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 175}}</ref> Though each [[corrido]] had their own style, flair, or message wanting to be relayed, they all exaggerated the life of Cortez to transform him into a Mexican [[folk hero]].\n\n=== With His Pistol in His Hand ===\n\nThe life and legend of Gregorio Cortez were studied by the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in a doctoral thesis on corridos that was later published in a revised version by the University of Texas Press in 1958 under the title ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016}}</ref> Paredes's work is about the life of Cortez, his legend, the formal aspects and variants of the corrido, and the cultural significance reflected in these products. \n\nThe book is one of the most influential books in  [[Chicano]] cultural studies and has received wide recognition and outstanding success in the academic world.<ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks. The Legacy of Am\u00e9rico Paredes. vol. no. 10, Texas A & M University Press, College Station, 2006. p71 </ref> <ref> [https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/benson/paredes/biography.html Meier, Matt. ''Am\u00e9rico Paredes.'']</ref>. The particularity of the work is that it constitutes a hybrid of genres. The first chapter and the third chapters are historical. In the first one, he retraces the social and political background of the former Spanish province of [[Nuevo Santander]] to explain the origin of ethnic tensions. In the third chapter, through extensive corpus sources (judicial reports, newspapers, and testimonies) he reconstructs in detail the whole life of Cortez. The second chapter could be classified as a study of regional folklore because he describes \"an idealized and formalized version of the legend.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 108}}</ref> In the second part of the book \"El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez, a Ballad of Border Conflict,\u201d Paredes provides a study of the narrative form of the corrido. This part integrates elements of sociolinguistics, through an analysis of the choice of words and the mixing of English and Spanish, anthropology, through an ethnographic description of the border culture, ethnomusicology with a study of the different variants of Gregorio Cortez's Ballad and their meanings <ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks. The Legacy of Am\u00e9rico Paredes. vol. no. 10, Texas A & M University Press, College Station, 2006.pp 71-82</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== In Film ===\n\nThe legend was turned into the film ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]], in 1983. It was directed by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], and based on Paredes's  ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p 64</ref>. The film deals with the creation of the myth as well as the reconstruction of the historical reality of the life and adventure of Gregorio Cortez.<ref>{{harvnb|Elitzik|1984|page= 38}}</ref>\n\nThe film is classified as a Western, but it is different from other films of the genre due to its historical realism. While classic elements of a western are present in the film such as horse racing, a lynch mob, a heroic sheriff and the vast desert space of Texas, the film's authenticity is a profound departure from this genre <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human. If you go too heavy on the racism, it makes it difficult to see them as people.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Juan Cortina]]\n* [[Joaquin Murietta]]\n* [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]\n* [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]\n* [[Manifest Destiny]]\n* [[Texas Ranger Division]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}} \n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation|last= Alonzo |first= A.

From 1946 to 1956, these were [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]] and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] (though the Paramount Television Network had some limited success during these years). From 1956 to 1986, the \"[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]]\" national commercial networks were ABC, CBS, and NBC (with a few limited attempts to challenge them, such as [[National Telefilm Associates]] [and its [[NTA Film Network]]] and the [[Overmyer Network]]). From 1954 to 1970, [[National Educational Television]] was the national clearinghouse for [[public broadcasting|public TV]] programming; the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]) succeeded it in 1970.\n\nToday, more than fifty national free-to-air networks exist. Other than the [[non-commercial educational]] (NCE) PBS, which is composed of [[network affiliate#member stations|member stations]], the largest terrestrial [[television network]]s are the traditional [[Big Three television networks]] (ABC, CBS and NBC). Many other large networks exist, however, notably [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[The CW]] which air original programming for two hours each night instead of three like the original \"Big Three\" do, as well as syndication services like [[MyNetworkTV]] and [[Ion Television]] which feature reruns of recent popular shows with little to no original programming. Fox has just about the same household reach percentage as the Big Three, and is therefore often considered a peer to ABC, NBC, and CBS since it has also achieved equal or better ratings since the late 1990s; as of 2019, it also programs the equivalent amount of sports programming as the Big Three. Most media outlets now include Fox in what they refer to as the \"Big Four\" TV networks.\n\nThe transition to [[digital broadcasting]] in 2009 has allowed for television stations to offer additional programming options through [[digital subchannel]]s, one or more supplementary programming streams to the station's primary channel that are achieved through [[multiplex (television)|multiplexing]] of a station's signal. A number of new commercial networks airing specialty programming such as movies, reruns of classic series and lifestyle programs have been created from companies like [[Weigel Broadcasting]], [[Luken Communications]] and even owners of the major networks such as [[Fox Corporation]] (through the Fox Entertainment subsidiary), [[ViacomCBS]], [[The Walt Disney Company]] (through the [[Walt Disney Television]] subsidiary) and [[Comcast]] (through the [[NBCUniversal]] subsidiary). Through the use of multicasting, there have also been a number of new Spanish-language and non-commercial public TV networks that have launched.\n\nFree-to-air networks in the U.S. can be divided into four categories:\n* [[Commercial broadcasting|Commercial]] networks \u2013 which air English-language programming to a general [[audience]] (for example, CBS);\n* Spanish-language networks \u2013 fully programmed networks which air Spanish-language programming to a primarily [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latin American audience]] (for example, [[Telemundo]] and [[Univision]]);\n* Educational and other non-commercial broadcast networks \u2013 which air English- and some foreign-language [[television program]]ming, intended to be [[educational television|educational]] in nature or otherwise of a sort not found on [[commercial television]] (for example, PBS);\n* [[Religious broadcasting|Religious broadcast]] networks \u2013 which air religious study and other faith-based programs, and in some cases, family-oriented secular programs (for example, Daystar).\n\nEach network sends its signal to many local [[network affiliate|affiliate]] [[television station]]s across the country. These local stations then air the \"network feed,\" with programs broadcast by each network being viewed by up to tens of millions of households across the country. In the case of the largest networks, the signal is sent to over 200 stations. In the case of the smallest networks, the signal may be sent to just a dozen or fewer stations.\n\nAs of the 2016\u201317 television season, there are an estimated 118.4 million households in the U.S. with at least one TV set.<ref>http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2016/nielsen-estimates-118-4-million-tv-homes-in-the-us--for-the-2016-17-season.html</ref>\n\n==Table of Networks==\nAll of the networks listed below operate a number of terrestrial TV stations.

From 1946 to 1956, these were [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]] and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] (though the Paramount Television Network had some limited success during these years). From 1956 to 1986, the \"[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]]\" national commercial networks were ABC, CBS, and NBC (with a few limited attempts to challenge them, such as [[National Telefilm Associates]] [and its [[NTA Film Network]]] and the [[Overmyer Network]]). From 1954 to 1970, [[National Educational Television]] was the national clearinghouse for [[public broadcasting|public TV]] programming; the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]) succeeded it in 1970.\n\nToday, more than fifty national free-to-air networks exist. Other than the [[non-commercial educational]] (NCE) PBS, which is composed of [[network affiliate#member stations|member stations]], the largest terrestrial [[television network]]s are the traditional [[Big Three television networks]] (ABC, CBS and NBC). Many other large networks exist, however, notably [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[The CW]] which air original programming for two hours each night instead of three like the original \"Big Three\" do, as well as syndication services like [[MyNetworkTV]] and [[Ion Television]] which feature reruns of recent popular shows with little to no original programming. Fox has just about the same household reach percentage as the Big Three, and is therefore often considered a peer to ABC, NBC, and CBS since it has also achieved equal or better ratings since the late 1990s; as of 2019, it also programs the equivalent amount of sports programming as the Big Three. Most media outlets now include Fox in what they refer to as the \"Big Four\" TV networks.\n\nThe transition to [[digital broadcasting]] in 2009 has allowed for television stations to offer additional programming options through [[digital subchannel]]s, one or more supplementary programming streams to the station's primary channel that are achieved through [[multiplex (television)|multiplexing]] of a station's signal. A number of new commercial networks airing specialty programming such as movies, reruns of classic series and lifestyle programs have been created from companies like [[Weigel Broadcasting]], [[Luken Communications]] and even owners of the major networks such as [[Fox Corporation]] (through the Fox Entertainment subsidiary), [[ViacomCBS]], [[The Walt Disney Company]] (through the [[Walt Disney Television]] subsidiary) and [[Comcast]] (through the [[NBCUniversal]] subsidiary). Through the use of multicasting, there have also been a number of new Spanish-language and non-commercial public TV networks that have launched.\n\nFree-to-air networks in the U.S. can be divided into four categories:\n* [[Commercial broadcasting|Commercial]] networks \u2013 which air English-language programming to a general [[audience]] (for example, CBS);\n* Spanish-language networks \u2013 fully programmed networks which air Spanish-language programming to a primarily [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latin American audience]] (for example, [[Telemundo]] and [[Univision]]);\n* Educational and other non-commercial broadcast networks \u2013 which air English- and some foreign-language [[television program]]ming, intended to be [[educational television|educational]] in nature or otherwise of a sort not found on [[commercial television]] (for example, PBS);\n* [[Religious broadcasting|Religious broadcast]] networks \u2013 which air religious study and other faith-based programs, and in some cases, family-oriented secular programs (for example, Daystar).\n\nEach network sends its signal to many local [[network affiliate|affiliate]] [[television station]]s across the country. These local stations then air the \"network feed,\" with programs broadcast by each network being viewed by up to tens of millions of households across the country. In the case of the largest networks, the signal is sent to over 200 stations. In the case of the smallest networks, the signal may be sent to just a dozen or fewer stations.\n\nAs of the 2016\u201317 television season, there are an estimated 118.4 million households in the U.S. with at least one TV set.<ref>http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2016/nielsen-estimates-118-4-million-tv-homes-in-the-us--for-the-2016-17-season.html</ref>\n\n==Table of Networks==\nAll of the networks listed below operate a number of terrestrial TV stations.

But Hogan has a sexual habit that makes Spence's dad and girlfriend ([[Kaley Cuoco]]) fear that Spence could adopt it, too. It is an attraction to older\u2014if not just plain old\u2014women.\n\nIn college, Hogan makes out with his much older professor ([[Carrie Fisher]]) just before the graduation ceremony. In a private celebration, he dances intimately with the much older wife of the party's host, Olivia ([[Faye Dunaway]]). The host is a lawyer whom Spence's father asked for a favor in hiring Spence for residency. Hogan and the host's wife disappear, but when the front wall of the treehouse Spence built as a child breaks down, everybody sees her [[Woman on top (sex position)|mounting him]]. Losing his chance of residency, Spence's father has to ask for a favor from the worst possible candidate \u2014 the most evil divorce lawyer in town, Mr. Stack ([[Joe Mantegna]]).\n\nNevertheless, Spence coaxes his father to get the same job for Hogan. Thus the two best friends begin to work together. Alas, the divorce lawyers know they need their recommendation in order to be accepted into law school. Therefore, they abuse them in every way possible, from physical chores (like cutting one of the lawyers' overly dirty toenails) to doing risky and illegal [[Private investigator|PI]] work.\n\nBetween cleaning bathrooms and walking in on Hogan having [[Doggy style|Doggie Style sex]] with the office's older secretary ([[Loretta Devine]]) in the closet, Spence feels his life is not going well. One errand has Spence and Hogan delivering divorce papers to Mr. Stack's wife. Other middle-aged women are also in her house listening to a sex seminar. Hogan is approached by the woman he had sex with in the treehouse, who asks him if he and Spence had any friends who could provide pleasure for her and the other middle-aged wives and divorc\u00e9es.  It gives him an idea for an alternative source of livelihood. That is, forming \"Cougar Club\" - a place for young men to meet older women. Expensive membership fees would provide access to parties and other social gatherings.\n\nTheir first client is a pre-[[Bar examination]] law graduate in their office, who up until now only has had sex by masturbating and performing sex acts on a filing cabinet. He gains revenge on his hated boss when the guys set him up with the boss' wife, a lusty and busty Amazon, Teddy Archibald ([[Chyna]]). Meanwhile, Spence has sex with Mr. Stacks' now ex-wife in his childhood bed and Hogan, unenthusiastically and a little traumatically because she was to young for his liking, had sex with one of the other Law firm Partner's wife. Living at home, Spence's parents\u2014accompanied by Mr. Stack\u2014return by surprise from a vacation. Spence manages to hide the sexually engaged guests. Only the wife he has slept with, Danielle ([[Izabella Scorupco]]) is caught by Spence's girlfriend and spotted by her lawyer ex-husband, Mr. Stack.\n\nSaid husband finds papers Spence left in the office about Cougar Club. He realizes they slept with the lawyers' wives. He tips the police and a detective infiltrates the next party. When Spence and Hogan ask him for membership fees, he arrests them for pandering. The lawyer then casually walks by and fires them.\n\nSpence returns to his girlfriend. She begins planning a wedding for them. Hogan, who crashes in with his former college professor, eventually approaches Spence with an idea\u2014luring the vengeful lawyers to bomb his car and get arrested for terrorist acts. After the plan is carried out with success, Spence confesses to his girlfriend that he does not really love her, that he never even asked her to marry him, and once again becomes best friends with Hogan.\n\nAt their trial, Spence and Hogan use the questionable yet free services of their friend who has now passed the bar exam. The judge ([[Carolyn Hennesy]]) asks to see them in her chambers. With their lawyer momentarily outside, Hogan contends to running a legit dating service as a true cougar fan. She considers acquitting them if Spence proves he feels like Hogan. Wearing revealing clothes under her robe, she kisses Spence. He goes along with it and they make out right on her desk.\n\nSpence invites the lawyer's wife to a new party. She never shows up, but he is still thrilled when a new cougar\u2014the judge\u2014arrives to celebrate with him. With no recommendation letter, Spence and Hogan expand the business via a statewide bus tour with club members and cougars alike.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Jurman]] as Spence Holmes\n* [[Warren Kole]] as Marshall Hogan III\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Mr. Stack\n* [[Kaley Cuoco]] as Amanda\n* [[Izabella Scorupco]] as Daniella Stack\n* [[Chyna]] as Teddy Archibald\n* [[Jon Polito]] as Mr. Archibald\n* [[Loretta Devine]] as Dolly\n* [[Jeremy Rowley]] as Karl\n* [[Scott Michael Campbell]] as Mr. Conrad\n* [[Mo Collins]] as Cindy Conrad\n* [[Molly Cheek]] as Mrs. Holmes\n* [[Robin Thomas]] as Mr. Holmes\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as Glady Goodbey\n* [[Carolyn Hennesy]] as Judge Margaret Emerson\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Edith Birnbaum\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0795361}}\n* {{amg title|415250}}\n\n[[Category:2007 films]]\n[[Category:2000s comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s sex comedy films]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2007 film directed by Christopher Duddy}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Cougar Club\n| image          = Cougar club dvd cover.jpg\n| caption        = DVD cover\n| director       = Christopher Duddy\n| producer       = Christopher Duddy<br />Glenn W.

Losing his chance of residency, Spence's father has to ask for a favor from the worst possible candidate \u2014 the most evil divorce lawyer in town, Mr. Stack ([[Joe Mantegna]]).\n\nNevertheless, Spence coaxes his father to get the same job for Hogan. Thus the two best friends begin to work together. Alas, the divorce lawyers know they need their recommendation in order to be accepted into law school. Therefore, they abuse them in every way possible, from physical chores (like cutting one of the lawyers' overly dirty toenails) to doing risky and illegal [[Private investigator|PI]] work.\n\nBetween cleaning bathrooms and walking in on Hogan having [[Doggy style|Doggie Style sex]] with the office's older secretary ([[Loretta Devine]]) in the closet, Spence feels his life is not going well. One errand has Spence and Hogan delivering divorce papers to Mr. Stack\u2019s wife. Other middle-aged women are also in her house listening to a sex seminar. Hogan is approached by the woman he had sex with in the treehouse, who asks him if he and Spence had any friends who could provide pleasure for her and the other middle-aged wives and divorc\u00e9es.  It gives him an idea for an alternative source of livelihood. That is, forming \"Cougar Club\" - a place for young men to meet older women. Expensive membership fees would provide access to parties and other social gatherings.\n\nTheir first client is a pre-[[Bar examination]] law graduate in their office, who up until now only has had sex by masturbating and performing sex acts on a filing cabinet. He gains revenge on his hated boss when the guys set him up with the boss' wife, a lusty and busty Amazon, Teddy Archibald ([[Chyna]]). Meanwhile, Spence has sex with Mr. Stacks' now ex-wife in his childhood bed and Hogan, unenthusiastically and a little traumatically because she was to young for his liking, had sex with one of the other Law firm Partner\u2019s wife. Living at home, Spence's parents\u2014accompanied by Mr. Stack\u2014return by surprise from a vacation. Spence manages to hide the sexually engaged guests. Only the wife he has slept with, Danielle ([[Izabella Scorupco]]) is caught by Spence's girlfriend and spotted by her lawyer ex-husband, Mr. Stack.\n\nSaid husband finds papers Spence left in the office about Cougar Club. He realizes they slept with the lawyers' wives. He tips the police and a detective infiltrates the next party. When Spence and Hogan ask him for membership fees, he arrests them for pandering. The lawyer then casually walks by and fires them.\n\nSpence returns to his girlfriend. She begins planning a wedding for them. Hogan, who crashes in with his former college professor, eventually approaches Spence with an idea\u2014luring the vengeful lawyers to bomb his car and get arrested for terrorist acts. After the plan is carried out with success, Spence confesses to his girlfriend that he does not really love her, that he never even asked her to marry him, and once again becomes best friends with Hogan.\n\nAt their trial, Spence and Hogan use the questionable yet free services of their friend who has now passed the bar exam. The judge ([[Carolyn Hennesy]]) asks to see them in her chambers. With their lawyer momentarily outside, Hogan contends to running a legit dating service as a true cougar fan. She considers acquitting them if Spence proves he feels like Hogan. Wearing revealing clothes under her robe, she kisses Spence. He goes along with it and they make out right on her desk.\n\nSpence invites the lawyer's wife to a new party. She never shows up, but he is still thrilled when a new cougar\u2014the judge\u2014arrives to celebrate with him. With no recommendation letter, Spence and Hogan expand the business via a statewide bus tour with club members and cougars alike.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Jurman]] as Spence Holmes\n* [[Warren Kole]] as Marshall Hogan III\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Mr. Stack\n* [[Kaley Cuoco]] as Amanda\n* [[Izabella Scorupco]] as Daniella Stack\n* [[Chyna]] as Teddy Archibald\n* [[Jon Polito]] as Mr. Archibald\n* [[Loretta Devine]] as Dolly\n* [[Jeremy Rowley]] as Karl\n* [[Scott Michael Campbell]] as Mr. Conrad\n* [[Mo Collins]] as Cindy Conrad\n* [[Molly Cheek]] as Mrs. Holmes\n* [[Robin Thomas]] as Mr. Holmes\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as Glady Goodbey\n* [[Carolyn Hennesy]] as Judge Margaret Emerson\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Edith Birnbaum\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0795361}}\n* {{amg title|415250}}\n\n[[Category:2007 films]]\n[[Category:2000s comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s sex comedy films]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar_Club"}

In a recipe adapted for the [[Lent]]en [[Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church|fast]], [[walnuts]] were recommended.<ref name=serventi235/>\n\nThe traditional lasagne of Naples, ''lasagne di carnevale'', are layered with local [[sausage]], small fried [[meatballs]], [[hard-boiled eggs]], [[ricotta]] and [[mozzarella]] cheeses, and sauced with a [[Neapolitan rag\u00f9]], a meat sauce.<ref name=\"delconte\">{{cite book |last=Del Conte |first=Anna |title=Gastronomy of Italy |date=December 1, 2013 |isbn=978-1862059580 |publisher=Pavilion }}</ref> ''Lasagne al forno'', layered with a thicker rag\u00f9 and [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]], and corresponding to the most common version of the dish outside Italy, are traditionally associated with the [[Emilia-Romagna]] region of Italy. In other regions, lasagne can be made with various combinations of ricotta or mozzarella cheese, [[tomato sauce]], meats (e.g., ground beef, pork or chicken), and vegetables (e.g., spinach, zucchini, olives, mushrooms), and the dish is typically flavoured with [[wine]], [[garlic]], [[onion]], and [[oregano]]. In all cases, the lasagne are oven-baked ([[al forno]]).\n\nTraditionally, pasta dough prepared in [[Southern Italy]] used [[semolina]] and water; in the [[Northern Italy|northern regions]], where semolina was not available, [[flour]] and [[Egg (food)|eggs]] were used. In modern Italy, since the only type of wheat allowed for commercially sold pasta is [[durum wheat]], commercial lasagne are made of semolina from durum wheat.<ref>{{cite web |title=Presidential Decree 187 |url=http://www.pasta-unafpa.org/pdf/ITALIA.pdf |publisher=translation from UA A.F.P.A |accessdate=7 October 2012 |date=9 February 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, and especially in its capital, [[Bologna]], layers of lasagne are traditionally green (the color is obtained by mixing spinach or other vegetables in the dough) and served with [[rag\u00f9 alla bolognese|rag\u00f9]] (a thick sauce made from onions, carrots, celery, finely ground pork and beef, butter, and tomatoes),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Regional Italian cuisine: typical recipes and culinary impressions from all regions|last=Hess|first=Reinhardt|last2=S\u00e4lzer|first2=Sabine|publisher=Barron's|year=1999|isbn=9780764151590|location=|pages=|oclc=42786762}}</ref><ref>Root, Waverley.

In a recipe adapted for the [[Lent]]en [[Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church|fast]], [[walnuts]] were recommended.<ref name=serventi235/>\n\nThe traditional lasagne of Naples, ''lasagne di carnevale'', are layered with local [[sausage]], small fried [[meatballs]], [[hard-boiled eggs]], [[ricotta]] and [[mozzarella]] cheeses, and sauced with a [[Neapolitan rag\u00f9]], a meat sauce.<ref name=\"delconte\">{{cite book |last=Del Conte |first=Anna |title=Gastronomy of Italy |date=December 1, 2013 |isbn=978-1862059580 |publisher=Pavilion }}</ref> ''Lasagne al forno'', layered with a thicker rag\u00f9 and [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]], and corresponding to the most common version of the dish outside Italy, are traditionally associated with the [[Emilia-Romagna]] region of Italy. In other regions, lasagne can be made with various combinations of ricotta or mozzarella cheese, [[tomato sauce]], meats (e.g., ground beef, pork or chicken), and vegetables (e.g., spinach, zucchini, olives, mushrooms), and the dish is typically flavoured with [[wine]], [[garlic]], [[onion]], and [[oregano]]. In all cases, the lasagne are oven-baked ([[al forno]]).\n\nTraditionally, pasta dough prepared in [[Southern Italy]] used [[semolina]] and water; in the [[Northern Italy|northern regions]], where semolina was not available, [[flour]] and [[Egg (food)|eggs]] were used. In modern Italy, since the only type of wheat allowed for commercially sold pasta is [[durum wheat]], commercial lasagne are made of semolina from durum wheat.<ref>{{cite web |title=Presidential Decree 187 |url=http://www.pasta-unafpa.org/pdf/ITALIA.pdf |publisher=translation from UA A.F.P.A |accessdate=7 October 2012 |date=9 February 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, and especially in its capital, [[Bologna]], layers of lasagne are traditionally green (the color is obtained by mixing spinach or other vegetables in the dough) and served with [[rag\u00f9 alla bolognese|rag\u00f9]] (a thick sauce made from onions, carrots, celery, finely ground pork and beef, butter, and tomatoes),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Regional Italian cuisine: typical recipes and culinary impressions from all regions|last=Hess|first=Reinhardt|last2=S\u00e4lzer|first2=Sabine|publisher=Barron's|year=1999|isbn=9780764151590|location=|pages=|oclc=42786762}}</ref><ref>Root, Waverley.

Her parents were both married to other people at the time of their affair and stayed together for four years, separating in 1975, when Chiara was two years old. She later revealed that she could not recall them being together: \"I've never seen my parents together, never in my whole life.

In the 19th century, the government of Russia encouraged peasants to move from the western parts of the empire to Siberia. Ukrainian peasants, not as burdened by the traditional Russian communal system of agriculture as the Russian peasants had been, seemed ideal candidates for resettlement, often more willing to go in return for the promise of more land. The literacy societies were among the few public service organizations in Tsarist Russia. The Khar\u2019khov Society, while Russian-speaking, included many Ukrainians and was among the most active of such societies. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/205/|title=Siberia and Migrants|year=1892}}</ref>\n\n====Cossak Settlement====\n\n===Soviet era===\n[[File:Ukrainians in Russian regions 1926.jpg|thumb|250px|Number and share of Ukrainians in the population of the regions of the [[RSFSR]] (1926 census)]]\n[[File:Ukrainians in Russian regions 1989.jpg|thumb|250px|Number and share of Ukrainians in the population of the regions of the [[RSFSR]] (1989 census)]]\n===Dekulakization===\n{{Main|Dekulakization}}\n[[Kulak]]s and their families were deported.\n====World War II refugees====\nDuring [[Operation Barbarossa]] evacuations of [[Russians|Russian]], [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] civilians from Europe over the [[Ural Mountains]] Commenced, These evacuees Included skilled Ukrainian and [[Jews|Jewish]] workers and Professionals as well as nationally conscious members of the Ukrainian [[Clergy]] and intelligentsia.

In the 19th century, the government of Russia encouraged peasants to move from the western parts of the empire to Siberia. Ukrainian peasants, not as burdened by the traditional Russian communal system of agriculture as the Russian peasants had been, seemed ideal candidates for resettlement, often more willing to go in return for the promise of more land. The literacy societies were among the few public service organizations in Tsarist Russia. The Khar\u2019khov Society, while Russian-speaking, included many Ukrainians and was among the most active of such societies. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/205/|title=Siberia and Migrants|year=1892}}</ref>\n\n====Cossak Settlement====\n\n===Soviet era===\n[[File:Ukrainians in Russian regions 1926.jpg|thumb|250px|Number and share of Ukrainians in the population of the regions of the [[RSFSR]] (1926 census)]]\n[[File:Ukrainians in Russian regions 1989.jpg|thumb|250px|Number and share of Ukrainians in the population of the regions of the [[RSFSR]] (1989 census)]]\n===Dekulakization===\n{{Main|Dekulakization}}\n[[Kulak]]s and their families were deported.\n====World War II refugees====\nDuring [[Operation Barbarossa]] evacuations of [[Russians|Russian]], [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] civilians from Europe over the [[Ural Mountains]] Commenced, These evacuees Included skilled Ukrainian and [[Jews|Jewish]] workers and Professionals as well as nationally conscious members of the Ukrainian [[Clergy]] and intelligentsia.

B. Rogers|James B. Rogers]] and written by [[Adam Herz]] and [[David H. Steinberg]] from a story by Herz. A sequel to the 1999 comedy film ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', it the second film in the [[American Pie (film series)|''American Pie'' series]] and stars [[Jason Biggs]], [[Shannon Elizabeth]], [[Alyson Hannigan]], [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]], [[Natasha Lyonne]], [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]], [[Tara Reid]], [[Seann William Scott]], [[Mena Suvari]], [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]], and [[Eugene Levy]]. The film follows the sexual exploits of five friends\u2014[[Jim Levenstein]], [[List of American Pie characters#Kevin Myers|Kevin Myers]], [[Steve Stifler]], [[List of American Pie characters#Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher|Oz Ostreicher]], and [[List of American Pie characters#Paul Finch|Paul Finch]]\u2014and their attempts to have the greatest summer party ever, at a summer beach house in [[Grand Haven, Michigan]].\n\n''American Pie 2'' was released in the United States on August 10, 2001, and grossed over $145 million in the US and $142 million overseas on a budget of $30 million, making it highest-grossing film in the franchise at just under $288 million worldwide. The film was followed by ''[[American Wedding]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter their freshman year at college, the four friends regroup for a party held by Stifler ([[Seann William Scott]]), their overtly sex-crazed class clown and good friend. His party is shut down in part to the neighbors calling the police. Kevin ([[Thomas Ian Nicholas]]) is inspired by his brother to make his summer with his friends count by renting a beach home. He, Jim, Oz, and Finch plan to take off to a beach house together, where they intend to spend the summer. Kevin realizes a problem and worked out that they can only afford the house if they have a fifth member to work along with them. Stifler takes charge of much of the organizing, often ending up leading the group in their misadventures.\n\nOz ([[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]]) is miserable, being away from his girlfriend Heather ([[Mena Suvari]]), who is in [[Spain]]. During the stay at the beach house, they proceed to start having [[phone sex]] to vent some of their loneliness, which ends up being interrupted by Stifler. Heather later shows up early to the party, ending the short storyline that Oz is involved in.\n\nAfter arriving in Grand Harbor they settle in, they manage to find work painting a house (based on the Tuition Painters franchise) in the area together, mistaking the owners for lesbians. Jim ([[Jason Biggs]]), Stifler and Finch ([[Eddie Kaye Thomas]]) end up performing \"like for like\" sexual acts on each other in return for being able to watch the girls doing the same thing. Oz and Kevin take turns watching up a ladder and listening on the walkie-talkie also in the room. The conversation is accidentally picked up and heard by many other people in the [[neighbourhood|neighborhood]]. Finally at the end of the last party, Stifler manages to have a wild threesome with the owners of the house.\n\nAfter this, many concurrent stories run at the same time, some interacting with each other, others staying mainly separate.\n\nNadia ([[Shannon Elizabeth]]) is coming to visit Jim in August. When she arrives early, Jim asks for help from [[band geek]] Michelle ([[Alyson Hannigan]]), humiliating himself in front of the audience when he pretends to be Petey, a mentally challenged boy who plays the trombone. They pretend to be in a relationship so that Nadia will not expect Jim to have sex (Jim is involved in an incident involving a tube of super glue he mistook for lube; he accidentally glued his hand to his penis while watching a porno film and injured himself, leaving him wounded and unable to perform). Jim and Michelle break the mock relationship off once he is ready to have sex with Nadia, but by then Michelle has really fallen in love with Jim, and soon Jim realizes that he has found his soul-mate in Michelle. Nadia also realizes this and tells him, \"Go, get your band geek, and I will find mine\". Jim goes and plays the [[trombone]] once more whilst Michelle is playing the flute at a major recital in order to show her that she is the one he wants to be with.\n\nFinch has become involved in the sexual art of [[Tantra]], and claims that through Tantra he can \"make an [[orgasm]] last for days\". He is waiting for Stifler's Mom ([[Jennifer Coolidge]]), who he had sex with in the first film, hoping she will show up and be willing to do it again. He thinks she arrives when a vehicle turns up after Stifler is talking on the phone, but it turns out to be his little brother Matt ([[Eli Marienthal]]). He spends the night talking with a few girls, but he doesn't sleep with any of them. \n\nThe geeky Sherman ([[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]]) gives up on getting anyone after he is turned down by the experienced and sharp-tongued Jessica ([[Natasha Lyonne]]), but the rejected Nadia, who wanted Jim because he was a geek, is turned on by his \"Sherminator\" gimmick, and they end up in bed together. Kevin doesn't end up \"getting off\" with anyone, but he does seem to succeed in getting over Vicky ([[Tara Reid]]) after making advances on her throughout the film.\n\nThe next morning, after the party, a [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[coupe]] with darkened windows turns up, Finch approaches and it turns out Stifler's Mom has come after all. He jumps at the chance and they drive off together, Stifler not realizing until after the car has driven off that it was Finch and his mother. After being asked, she reveals her name is Jeanine, but also instructs Finch to resume calling her \"Stifler's mom\" as per usual.\n\n==Different versions==\nTwo versions of the film have been released: the R-rated theatrical version and the unrated version.

B. Rogers|James B. Rogers]] and written by [[Adam Herz]] and [[David H. Steinberg]] from a story by Herz. A sequel to the 1999 comedy film ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', it the second film in the [[American Pie (film series)|''American Pie'' series]] and stars [[Jason Biggs]], [[Shannon Elizabeth]], [[Alyson Hannigan]], [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]], [[Natasha Lyonne]], [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]], [[Tara Reid]], [[Seann William Scott]], [[Mena Suvari]], [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]], and [[Eugene Levy]]. The film follows the sexual exploits of five friends\u2014[[Jim Levenstein]], [[List of American Pie characters#Kevin Myers|Kevin Myers]], [[Steve Stifler]], [[List of American Pie characters#Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher|Oz Ostreicher]], and [[List of American Pie characters#Paul Finch|Paul Finch]]\u2014and their attempts to have the greatest summer party ever, at a summer beach house in [[Grand Haven, Michigan]].\n\n''American Pie 2'' was released in the United States on August 10, 2001, and grossed over $145 million in the US and $142 million overseas on a budget of $30 million, making it highest grossing film in the franchise at just under $288 million worldwide. The film was followed by ''[[American Wedding]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter their freshman year at college, the four friends regroup for a party held by Stifler ([[Seann William Scott]]), their overtly sex-crazed class clown and good friend. His party is shut down in part to the neighbors calling the police. Kevin ([[Thomas Ian Nicholas]]) is inspired by his brother to make his summer with his friends count by renting a beach home. He, Jim, Oz, and Finch plan to take off to a beach house together, where they intend to spend the summer. Kevin realizes a problem and worked out that they can only afford the house if they have a fifth member to work along with them. Stifler takes charge of much of the organizing, often ending up leading the group in their misadventures.\n\nOz ([[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]]) is miserable, being away from his girlfriend Heather ([[Mena Suvari]]), who is in [[Spain]]. During the stay at the beach house, they proceed to start having [[phone sex]] to vent some of their loneliness, which ends up being interrupted by Stifler. Heather later shows up early to the party, ending the short storyline that Oz is involved in.\n\nAfter arriving in Grand Harbor they settle in, they manage to find work painting a house (based on the Tuition Painters franchise) in the area together, mistaking the owners for lesbians. Jim ([[Jason Biggs]]), Stifler and Finch ([[Eddie Kaye Thomas]]) end up performing \"like for like\" sexual acts on each other in return for being able to watch the girls doing the same thing. Oz and Kevin take turns watching up a ladder and listening on the walkie-talkie also in the room. The conversation is accidentally picked up and heard by many other people in the [[neighbourhood|neighborhood]]. Finally at the end of the last party, Stifler manages to have a wild threesome with the owners of the house.\n\nAfter this, many concurrent stories run at the same time, some interacting with each other, others staying mainly separate.\n\nNadia ([[Shannon Elizabeth]]) is coming to visit Jim in August. When she arrives early, Jim asks for help from [[band geek]] Michelle ([[Alyson Hannigan]]), humiliating himself in front of the audience when he pretends to be Petey, a mentally challenged boy who plays the trombone. They pretend to be in a relationship so that Nadia will not expect Jim to have sex (Jim is involved in an incident involving a tube of super glue he mistook for lube; he accidentally glued his hand to his penis while watching a porno film and injured himself, leaving him wounded and unable to perform). Jim and Michelle break the mock relationship off once he is ready to have sex with Nadia, but by then Michelle has really fallen in love with Jim, and soon Jim realizes that he has found his soul-mate in Michelle. Nadia also realizes this and tells him, \"Go, get your band geek, and I will find mine\". Jim goes and plays the [[trombone]] once more whilst Michelle is playing the flute at a major recital in order to show her that she is the one he wants to be with.\n\nFinch has become involved in the sexual art of [[Tantra]], and claims that through Tantra he can \"make an [[orgasm]] last for days\". He is waiting for Stifler's Mom ([[Jennifer Coolidge]]), who he had sex with in the first film, hoping she will show up and be willing to do it again. He thinks she arrives when a vehicle turns up after Stifler is talking on the phone, but it turns out to be his little brother Matt ([[Eli Marienthal]]). He spends the night talking with a few girls, but he doesn't sleep with any of them. \n\nThe geeky Sherman ([[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]]) gives up on getting anyone after he is turned down by the experienced and sharp-tongued Jessica ([[Natasha Lyonne]]), but the rejected Nadia, who wanted Jim because he was a geek, is turned on by his \"Sherminator\" gimmick, and they end up in bed together. Kevin doesn't end up \"getting off\" with anyone, but he does seem to succeed in getting over Vicky ([[Tara Reid]]) after making advances on her throughout the film.\n\nThe next morning, after the party, a [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[coupe]] with darkened windows turns up, Finch approaches and it turns out Stifler's Mom has come after all. He jumps at the chance and they drive off together, Stifler not realizing until after the car has driven off that it was Finch and his mother. After being asked, she reveals her name is Jeanine, but also instructs Finch to resume calling her \"Stifler's mom\" as per usual.\n\n==Different versions==\nTwo versions of the film have been released: the R-rated theatrical version and the unrated version.

Paxson, who felt that television programs aired by other broadcast networks were too raunchy and not family-friendly enough, had decided to create a network that he perceived as an alternative. Since the new network would focus on programming tailored to family audiences, PAX maintained a considerably more conservative programming content policy than the major commercial television networks, restricting [[profanity]], [[violence]] and sexual content; accordingly, many of the network's acquired programs were edited to remove sexual and overt violent content, while profane language was [[ducking|muted]].\n\nMost of the network's initial affiliates were Paxson Communications-owned affiliate stations of the '''Infomall TV Network''' (inTV), a network launched by Paxson in 1995 that relied mainly on [[infomercial]]s and other [[brokered programming]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Paxson's IN TV: move over UPN, WB (Lowell Paxson predicts that his Infomall TV Network will out perform United Paramount Network and WB Network)|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16217997.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105130932/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16217997.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|periodical=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information|Cahners Business Information]]|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=January 23, 1995|url-access=subscription }}</ref> During the late spring and summer of 1998, a half-hour preview special hosted by former ''[[The Waltons|Waltons]]'' star [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]], featuring interviews with Lowell Paxson about PAX's development and initial programming, aired on inTV stations slated to become charter outlets of the new network.\n\nPAX launched on August 31, 1998,<ref>{{cite news|title=Pax TV to offer family programming|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4458284.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105132226/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4458284.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group|American Publishing Company]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=August 16, 1998|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=On Monday, the Genesis of PAX TV|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-668142.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610170848/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-668142.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 10, 2014|author=Lisa de Moraes|newspaper=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post Company|via=HighBeam Research|date=August 29, 1998|accessdate=February 25, 2013|url-access=subscription }}</ref> with the network's initial schedule being much larger in scope than it would be in later years.

Through an agreement with then-[[Disney]] owned animation studio [[DIC Productions L.P.]], its schedule also included a children's program block called \"Cloud Nine\" on Saturdays from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and Sundays from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. Central.<ref name=\"Pax SFGate\">{{cite news|title=PAX Going For Piece Of TV Pie|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/PAX-Going-For-Piece-Of-TV-Pie-2994282.php|author=John Carman|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Chronicle Publishing Company]]|date=August 28, 1998|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}</ref><ref name name=awm>Issue 3.2. {{cite news|title=DIC Pacts With PAX|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.2/3.2pages/3.2television.html|periodical=Animation World Magazine|date=May 1998|accessdate=March 1, 2014}}</ref> In addition, the network aired religious programming through time-lease agreements with [[The Worship Network]] (which aired its overnight programming on PAX seven nights a week) and Praise TV (featuring [[Contemporary Christian music]] and other faith-based programs aimed at teenagers and young adults, which aired on Friday and Saturday late-nights from 11:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. Central until 2000). The remainder of the schedule was filled by paid programming.\n\nInitial programming on PAX consisted of first-run shows (such as the true story profile series ''[[It's a Miracle (TV series)|It's a Miracle]]'', [[game show]] ''[[The Reel to Reel Picture Show]]'', and [[talk show]]s ''Woman's Day'' and ''Great Day America''), along with reruns of older programming (including ''[[Highway to Heaven]]'', ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', ''[[The Hogan Family]]'', ''[[Dave's World]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', and new episodes and older reruns of ''[[Candid Camera]]'', the latter of which moved to the network following the revival series' cancellation by [[CBS]] earlier in 1998). The network also produced some original drama series such as ''[[Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye]]'', ''[[Doc (2001 TV series)|Doc]]'', ''[[Mysterious Ways (TV series)|Mysterious Ways]]'' (which originated on [[NBC]]), ''[[Hope Island (TV series)|Hope Island]]'' and ''[[Twice in a Lifetime (TV series)|Twice in a Lifetime]]'' through its programming division, Paxson Productions. PAX also aired many game shows including first-run revivals of established games that originated on cable networks such as ''[[Supermarket Sweep]]'' and ''[[Shop 'til You Drop]]'', along with some original game shows such as ''[[On the Cover (game show)|On the Cover]]'', ''[[Balderdash (game show)|Balderdash]]'', a 2002 revival of ''[[Beat the Clock]]'', ''[[Hollywood Showdown]]'' (in conjunction with [[Game Show Network]], which also aired the show) and reruns of ''[[Born Lucky]]''. The network would later carry reruns of the syndicated revival of ''[[Family Feud]]'' (consisting of episodes from [[Louie Anderson]], [[Richard Karn]] and [[John O'Hurley]]'s tenures as host, airing on a one-year delay from their original syndication broadcast) and, due to its alliance with NBC, ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' (both from the [[Anne Robinson]]-hosted network run and the [[George Gray (TV host)|George Gray]]-hosted syndicated version) as well as the 2000 revival of ''[[Twenty One (game show)|Twenty-One]]''.\n\nIn September 1999, NBC purchased a 32% share of Paxson Communications for $415 million in convertible stock, with an option to expand its interest to 49% by February 2002, pending changes in ownership regulations set by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) that would allow it to acquire additional television stations.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Media Business: NBC Completes Acquisition Of 32% Stake in Paxson|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/17/business/the-media-business-nbc-completes-acquisition-of-32-stake-in-paxson.html|author=[[Bill Carter]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=September 17, 1999|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref> NBC later sold its share in the network back to Paxson in November 2003.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Media Business: Advertising; NBC Moves to Break Up Relationship with Paxson|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/14/business/the-media-business-advertising-nbc-moves-to-break-up-relationship-with-paxson.html|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 14, 2003|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn lieu of a national news program, in 2000, Paxson Communications signed an agreement with [[Jackson, Mississippi]]-based [[WeatherVision]] \u2013 which mainly produces weather forecast inserts for television stations in certain markets that do not operate an in-house news department or maintain a news share agreement with another local station \u2013 to produce ''Tomorrow's Weather Tonight'', a five-minute national forecast segment that aired Monday through Friday nights at the conclusion of PAX's entertainment schedule. Starting in 2001, many PAX stations also entered into news share agreements with a local major network affiliate (mostly involving NBC-affiliated stations, though some involved an affiliate of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] or CBS) to air [[broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] broadcasts of evening, and in some markets, morning newscasts from the partner station; in a few cases, the agreement partner produced live newscasts for the PAX station (as examples of the latter, NBC affiliate [[WTHR]] in [[Indianapolis]] produced a prime time newscast for PAX O&O [[WIPX-TV]] from February to June 2005, after CBS affiliate [[WISH-TV]] (now a [[The CW|CW]] affiliate) took over production of the newscast that WTHR had been producing for [[UPN]] affiliate [[WNDY-TV]] (now a [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate) since 1996; [[Cleveland]] NBC affiliate [[WKYC|WKYC-TV]] produced evening newscasts for WVPX-TV that focused primarily on that O&O's city of license, nearby [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]). In some cities, a major network affiliate also provided some engineering and other back office services for the PAX station.\n\nIn an effort to increase revenue due to low viewership and other financial issues, PAX gradually increased the amount of paid programming content on its schedule throughout the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], at the expense of its general entertainment programming. Infomercials and other types of brokered programs ultimately became the dominant form of programming during the network's broadcast day; by January 2005: the time that PAX had allocated to entertainment programs had been reduced to six hours on weekdays (from 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.) and five hours on weekends (from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Central Time). Original programming was also affected by the network's programming changes; PAX was originally offering five or six new series each season. However, in 2003, the number of new series that aired on PAX dwindled to just two: ''[[Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye]]'', which was cancelled in 2005, and ''Doc'', which was cancelled in 2004 after PAX's international backer, Canadian broadcast network [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], pulled out of producing the shows. The network seemingly recovered a year later when seven series made it to PAX's 2004\u201305 schedule.\n\n===''i'' (2005\u20132007)===\nOn June 28, 2005, Paxson Communications announced that it would rebrand PAX as '''i: Independent Television''' (commonly referred to as \"i\", stylized as ''i''), in order to reflect a new strategy of \"providing an independent broadcast platform for producers and syndicators who desire to reach a national audience.\" After the transition was complete, the network would continue to air programming under its Pax brand on one of its [[digital subchannel]]s over-the-air and on select cable providers (see [[#Ion Plus|below]]).\n\nThe rebranding also resulted in several changes to its programming lineup: infomercials replaced overnight programming from The Worship Network, which began to carry its full 24-hour schedule on a fourth digital subchannel of local ''i'' owned-and-operated stations and affiliates until the network was dropped in January 2010, in addition, ''Tomorrow's Weather Tonight'' and rebroadcasts of network affiliate newscasts were discontinued the day prior to the rebrand on June 30, 2005 (though a few stations not owned by the network's parent company retained news share agreements with major network stations after that date, such as [[WBNA]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], which continues to air newscasts from NBC affiliate [[WAVE (TV)|WAVE]] as of January 2015). The network shifted its format almost entirely to reruns of television series from the 1960s to the 1990s (such as ''[[Green Acres]]'', ''[[Amen (TV series)|Amen]]'', and Pax holdover ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'') and feature films, reruns of former Pax TV series (such as ''Doc'') and first-run episodes (and later reruns) of Pax holdover series ''[[America's Most Talented Kid]]s'' were also included as part of the schedule. In turn, the network adapted its programming content standards to those similar to other broadcast networks. During the 2005\u201306 season, the network launched only one new series that met the network's new mission of being an 'independent broadcast platform', the teen drama ''[[Palmetto Pointe]]'', which only lasted six episodes; the network went entirely to a lineup of reruns for the 2006\u201307 season (except for ''Health Report'' and Ion Life specials).\n\nIn November 2005, [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]] was granted a transferable option to purchase a controlling stake in Paxson Communications.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Had this option been exercised, NBC would have acquired approximately 63 ''i'' owned-and-operated stations (though this could have resulted in a forced divestiture of either ''i'' or [[Spanish language]] network [[Telemundo]], which NBC had acquired in April 2002 (prior to its merger with [[Vivendi Universal]]), along with the divested network's O&Os due to FCC rules that prohibit broadcasters from [[duopoly (broadcasting)#Triopolies and quadropolies|owning more than two television stations in the same market]] unless there are either a minimum of 20 full-power stations in the market or one of the stations is a [[broadcast relay station#Satellite stations|satellite]]). As part of the agreement, Lowell Paxson stepped down from his position as chairman of Paxson Communications.

The satellite provider cited that \"most of [''i'' Network's] programming consists of infomercials and other promotional shows\", despite an earlier promise by network executives that it \"would consist of general, family-oriented entertainment\". To appease DirecTV management, the network decided to drop some infomercials and shopping programs, and replace them with older [[public domain]] programs and cancelled Pax TV original series. The network and its stations were expected to be removed from the service by February 28, 2006. However, DirecTV and Ion Media Networks reached a new carriage agreement that May.\n\n===Ion Television (2007\u2013present)===\nOn January 29, 2007, the network changed its name again to '''Ion Television''' (as a result of its parent company's renaming to Ion Media Networks).

The network also aired a late afternoon sitcom block called \"Laugh Attack\", which featured reruns of comedy series targeted at [[African American]] audiences (originally consisting of ''[[Hangin' with Mr. Cooper]]'' and ''[[The Wayans Bros.]]'', the latter of which was later replaced by ''[[The Steve Harvey Show]]'').{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn January 2008, Ion Media and [[Comcast]] reached a carriage agreement to continue carrying Ion Television, while also adding [[Qubo]] and [[Ion Life]] to the cable provider's channel lineups.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ion Media Plugs In New Comcast Accord|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6522639.html|periodical=[[Multichannel News]]|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=2008-01-14}}</ref>\n\n====2008 relaunch====\nOn May 1, 2008, Ion Television held an upfront presentation announcing its programming for the 2008\u201309 season at the [[New York Public Library]] in [[Manhattan]].

More recent theatrically released feature films were also added to the lineup, alongside older movie releases from the 1980s and 1990s.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn April 2009, it was announced that Ion Media Networks was once again facing [[balance sheet]] problems.

It provides general entertainment programming to owned-and-operated and affiliated stations Monday through Thursdays from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m., Fridays from 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m., and Saturdays and Sundays from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. Central Time (the entertainment programming schedule starts six hours later and ends two hours earlier from Christmas to [[New Year's Day]], with paid programming filling the remaining vacated hours). A children's programming block known as the [[Qubo|Qubo Kids' Corner]] \u2013 which features programs compliant with FCC [[E/I|educational programming]] requirements \u2013 airs for three hours each Friday at 7:00 a.m. Central Time. All other time periods are filled with religious programming or infomercials.\n\nIon owned-and-operated stations and affiliates also provide limited [[local programming]] on weekday mornings to fulfill [[Public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] guidelines, which range from entirely local productions to Ion Life-sourced programs within which commercial slots are instead devoted to local physicians or experts giving locality-specific health advice or advertising their services. Ion also served as the over-the-air broadcast distribution point for [[TiVo]]'s ''Teleworld Paid Program'', a weekly 30-minute compilation program \u2013 usually carried during the overnight on Wednesdays or Thursdays within the network's designated paid programming time \u2013 it was specifically coded to distribute [[promo (media)|program previews]] and device tutorials for TiVo's [[digital video recorder]]s. TiVo discontinued the program in 2016 as broadband had become commonplace enough to end it.\n\nMost programs broadcast by Ion Television are distributed by either [[20th Century Fox Television]] or [[CBS Television Distribution]]. Ion Television also maintains film distribution deals with [[Paramount Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]]<ref name=deals>{{cite web|title=Ion Adds \"M*A*S*H\" to Weekdays, Ion Announces New Deals with Studios|url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/blog/2010/02/ion-adds-mash-to-weekdays-ion-announces.html|website=Sitcoms Online|date=February 16, 2010}}</ref> Series currently broadcast by Ion Television ({{as of|October 2015|lc=y}}) comprise mostly of dramas such as ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', ''[[Law & Order]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]'', ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numb3rs]]'', ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]'', and ''[[The Listener (TV series)|The Listener]]''. As of 2014, the network's format is predominantly devoted to marathon blocks of hour-long drama series, with consecutive episodes of a given series airing between two and 16 hours a day (depending on the day's schedule, with fewer hours in the morning and late fringe).\n\nThe network broadcasts [[feature film]]s released between the 1980s and the 2000s under the banner \"Ion Television at the Movies\", which fill the majority of the network's Sunday afternoon and evening schedule ([[Christmas and holiday season|holiday]]-themed made-for-TV films are also broadcast under the banner throughout the entertainment programming day on weekends between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as well as on [[Christmas Eve]] and Christmas Day regardless of where either holiday falls during the calendar week). Ion Television occasionally airs short hosted segments during its [[prime time]] lineup \u2013 particularly during film presentations \u2013 known as the \"Ion Lounge\", a lifestyle segment used mainly to advertise a company's product within the featured program's commercial breaks.\n\nIn the recent past, Ion Television has aired a limited number of comedy or comedy-drama series that were cycled on-and-off the schedule such as ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', ''[[Psych]]'' and ''[[Married... with Children]]'', with half-hour sitcoms used on certain occasions to [[Filler (media)|fill scheduling gaps]] prior to the telecast of its late-morning film presentations (usually in the 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Central Time half-hour, if the succeeding film ran for at least 2{{frac|1|2}} hours) due to their erratic scheduling; the network shifted to a more exclusive focus on dramas as part of its series content in January 2015, although the network continues to carry comedic programming in the form of select feature films aired within the \"Ion Television at the Movies\" block.\n\nIon's current method of running predominately [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming is very similar to the international model of broadcasting used in [[Europe]], [[Canada]], [[Latin America]], [[Asia]] and [[Australia]], which mixes imported and syndicated shows with original programming \u2013 a model used only in [[Television in the United States|United States broadcast television]] by digital multicast services (particularly those that specialize in acquired programs such as [[MeTV]]), smaller English language entertainment-based networks (such as [[America One]]) and networks broadcasting in languages other than [[English language|English]] (such as [[Univision]] and Telemundo). The major commercial broadcast networks in the U.S. \u2013 ABC, NBC, CBS, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and The CW \u2013 carry first-run programs produced for the network, while leaving the responsibility of acquiring shows from the syndication market to their owned-and-operated stations and affiliates to fill time not allotted to network and, where applicable, locally produced programs (MyNetworkTV, which is somewhat similar to Ion Television in its format, mixes elements of both models as acquired programs are supplied both during prime time by the service and by its stations at all other times). A limited number of non-Ion-owned stations that are merely affiliated with the network (such as Louisville outlet WBNA) do carry additional local or syndicated programming that, in some instances, pre-empts certain programs within the Ion master schedule.\n\n===Recent programming deals===\nIn 2006, Ion Media Networks reached several programming deals, two with major programming suppliers that were announced within a week of each other, and another that among other things would bring original programming to Ion Television's lineup. On June 27, 2006, Ion Media announced a comprehensive programming deal with [[Warner Bros.

Meanwhile, three series from CBS Television Distribution were added to the schedule: ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' joined the lineup in September 2008, while ''Criminal Minds'' and ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' were added to the Ion Television lineup in 2009.

In some markets, [[DirecTV]] carries a \"placeholder\" simulcast of the national modified feed of the network (for example, [[Los Angeles]] area viewers can watch Ion on both channels 30, via local O&O [[KPXN-TV]], and 305; [[New York City]] on channel 31 [[WPXN-TV|WPXN]] besides 305).\n\n===Major market absences and station oddities===\nIon Television does not have any over-the-air stations in several major [[media market|markets]], most notably [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]] ([[Verizon FiOS]] subscribers in [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]] receive the network's [[Washington, D.C.]] affiliate [[WPXW-TV]] as a default affiliate) and, [[KSWB-TV#Digital_television|prior to February 2020]],  San Diego, California.\n\nTwo major factors that have limited the network's national broadcast coverage are that unlike the major commercial broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and The CW), Ion did not actively seek over-the-air distribution on the [[digital subchannel]]s of other network-affiliated stations in the five years following the digital television transition (with limited exceptions in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]], [[Tucson, Arizona]] and [[Fresno, California]] through agreements with [[Telemundo]] [[KBLR (TV)|owned-and-]][[KNSO|operated]] [[KHRR|stations]] in those markets), until it reached a multi-station agreement with [[Media General]] in November 2015;<ref name=\"aas-ionkxan\">{{cite news|title=New broadcast TV network hits Austin's airwaves|url=http://www.mystatesman.com/news/entertainment/dinges-new-broadcast-tv-network-hits-austins-airwa/npMDg/|author=Gary Dinges|newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|publisher=[[Cox Enterprises]]|date=November 14, 2015|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}</ref> prior to that deal, it long had very few stations that [[network affiliate|contractually carry]] the network's programming (with limited exceptions in markets such as Louisville, Kentucky and [[Anchorage, Alaska]]). As a result, Ion Media Networks owns the vast majority of the stations within Ion Television's affiliate body, as well as those of co-owned multicast services Qubo Channel and Ion Life.\n\nIn [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], a deal by Paxson to buy [[WPCB-TV]] and trade it for secondary [[PBS]] member station WQEX was approved by the Federal Communications Commission, but rejected by WPCB-TV owner [[Cornerstone Television]] in a 2000 [[WINP-TV#Controversy|controversy]]; it would not be until November 2010 that Paxson's successor, Ion Media Networks, would successfully buy WQEX, which has since been converted into a commercially licensed outlet as Ion O&O [[WINP-TV]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ion to Buy WQEX: \"Positively entertaining\" network grabs Pittsburgh outlet|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/ion-buy-wqex/42607|author=Michael Malone|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=November 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ion Buying WQEX Pittsburgh For $3 Million|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/46835/ion-buying-wqex-pittsburgh-for-3-million|author=Harry A.

Under an agreement with [[Fox Television Stations]], Ion was added to a DT4 feed of Fox affiliate [[WJZY-TV]] (then owned-and-operated by Fox) on September 29, 2016.  Ion in Charlotte later moved to the DT6 feed of WJZY-TV.\n\n[[St. Louis]], at one time, received the network by way of a [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]] repeater of O&O [[WPXS]] in nearby [[Mount Vernon, Illinois]]; in December 2013, the [[United States bankruptcy court]] approved a plan by creditors of [[Roberts Broadcasting]] to transfer [[East St. Louis, Illinois|East St. Louis]]-based MyNetworkTV affiliate [[WRBU]] and its sister stations, CW affiliate [[WZRB]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]] and former CW affiliate [[WAZE-TV|WAZE-LP]] in [[Evansville, Indiana]], to a trust with Ion Media Networks \u2013 a creditor in Roberts' [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] proceedings, for which it filed in 2011 \u2013 that would serve as its beneficiary.

WAZE-LP was [[dark (broadcasting)|silent]] at the time of acquisition, having gone dark the previous year after failing to construct its digital transmitter facilities, and Ion eventually decided on an affiliation deal with [[Nexstar Media Group]]'s cluster in the area instead, using a subchannel of CW affiliate [[WTVW]].\n\n[[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Rochester, New York]], normally treated as separate markets, share Ion affiliate [[WPXJ-TV]], which is centrally located between the two cities and is licensed to [[Batavia, New York|Batavia]]. An equivalent case exists involving [[Battle Creek, Michigan]]-licensed [[WZPX-TV]], which serves both the [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] and [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] markets (it also unusually served as a secondary [[The WB|WB]] affiliate due to a lack of stations in both markets until the digital age); additionally, [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]-licensed [[WPXD-TV]] also once provided an equivalent over-the-air signal for Lansing before moving their signal to a new transmitter in the Detroit suburb of [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]] in 2012.\n\nIn addition, in several other markets, Ion's predecessor was sold to another television station group to affiliate with a different English or Spanish language network, and through either a lack of channel space or interest in the network, Ion would not reappear in most of those markets until reaching deals to air on digital subchannels of other stations. These include:\n* [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]: KAPX (now [[UniM\u00e1s]] owned-and-operated station [[KTFQ-DT|KTFQ]], Ion now on [[KWBQ]] 19.4)\n* [[Baraboo, Wisconsin]]: [[W43BR]] (now a [[The Family Channel (American TV network, founded 2008)|Family Channel]] affiliate, Ion now in Madison on [[WISC-TV|WISC]] 3.3)\n* [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]: [[WLFT-CD]] (now a [[Independent station (North America)|religious independent station]], Ion now on [[WVLA-TV|WVLA]] 33.3)\n* [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]\u2013[[Springfield, Illinois]]: WPXU (now CW affiliate [[WBUI]], Ion now on [[WAND]] 17.3)\n* [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]: WADA-LP (now [[WVIR-CD]] (translator of NBC affiliate [[WVIR-TV]]), Ion now on [[WCAV]] 19.4)\n* [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]\u2013[[Visalia, California]]: KPXF (now UniM\u00e1s owned-and-operated station [[KTFF-DT|KTFF]], Ion now on [[KNSO]] 51.3)\n* [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]: KYPX (now [[MeTV]] affiliate [[KMYA-DT|KMYA]]; Ion now on [[KARZ-TV|KARZ]] 42.3)\n* [[Montgomery, Alabama]]: [[WBMM]] (first switched to [[Daystar (TV network)|Daystar]], now a CW affiliate, Ion now on [[WAKA (TV)|WAKA]] 8.3)\n* [[Reno, Nevada]]: [[KREN-TV|KREN]] (now an Univision affiliate, Ion now on [[KTVN]] 2.3)\n* [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]: [[KPXJ]] (now a CW affiliate, Ion now on [[KSHV-TV|KSHV]] 45.3)\n* [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]: [[KAUN-LP]] (now a Retro TV affiliate, Ion now on [[KELO-TV|KELO]] 11.3)\n* [[Tucson, Arizona]]: [[KUVE-DT]] (now an Univision owned-and-operated station, Ion now on [[KOLD-TV|KOLD]] 13.4)\n\nIn November 2015, [[Media General]] and Ion came to terms on an affiliation deal to add Ion's main feed as a standard definition digital subchannel in non-Ion O&O markets with Media General stations to replace the programming of the long-defunct [[Live Well Network]], the first of its kind for Ion. Ion subchannels were added in markets such as [[Austin, Texas]]; [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]; [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]; [[Lafayette, Indiana]]; [[Davenport, Iowa]]; [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]; [[Lansing, Michigan]]; [[Richmond, Virginia]]; [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]; and [[Wichita, Kansas]].<ref name=\"aas-ionkxan\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=KWQC Davenport Adds Ion TV On Subchannel|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/89578/kwqc-davenport-adds-ion-tv-on-subchannel|author=Mark K. Miller|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=October 28, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}</ref> These deals would carry over after the Media General stations were integrated into the [[Nexstar Media Group]] in January 2017, with WBAY-TV continuing to carry Ion under [[Gray Television]] ownership. [[Morgan Murphy Media]]'s two Wisconsin stations ([[WISC-TV]]/[[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] and [[WKBT-DT]]/[[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]]\u2013[[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]]) began to carry the network as a third subchannel at the beginning of February 2017. The network further expanded its affiliate reach into small and lower-ranked mid-sized markets during late 2016 and 2017, with Ion Media striking additional deals with companies such as Gray Television, [[Hubbard Broadcasting]], [[Block Communications]], [[Forum Communications]], [[Heartland Media]] and the [[Meredith Corporation]] to carry Ion Television on digital subchannels of stations owned and/or operated by those groups.\n\nIn several markets, the station's [[city of license]] is considered outside the main portion of a market's metropolitan area. Such cases include [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], where that area's Ion owned-and-operated station, [[KPXM-TV]], is licensed to [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]] ({{convert|60|mi|km}} northwest of the Twin Cities); [[Detroit]], where O&O [[WPXD-TV]] is licensed to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] ({{convert|40|mi|km}} west of Detroit), though its digital transmitter is located in Southfield, where the bulk of Detroit's television stations base their studios and transmitter facilities; [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], where O&O [[WHPX-TV]] is licensed to [[New London, Connecticut]] (located {{convert|40|mi|km}} to the southeast); and [[Milwaukee]], where O&O [[WPXE-TV]] is licensed to [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]], with its digital transmitter located at a tower farm on Milwaukee's north side (its former analog transmitter was located south of the city in [[Racine County, Wisconsin|Racine County]]). In the Cleveland market, Ion airs on Akron-based WVPX-TV, which had formerly targeted Akron, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] and nearby areas as an ABC affiliate (then competing with the market's existing ABC station [[WEWS-TV|WEWS]]) prior to 1998.\n\n==Related services==\n\n===Multiplexing===\nIon Television's stations have made notable use of \"[[multiplexing]]\", or splitting a digital broadcast television signal into separate [[digital subchannel|subchannels]]. The network's stations usually carry up to six of these digital subchannels (in contrast with most other full-power stations, which usually carry a maximum of four channels over the same signal), each of which broadcast separate networks. Due to the bandwidth limitations caused by its carriage of multiple subchannels over a single broadcast signal, only the primary Ion network feed is transmitted in high definition, even though most of its stations transmit two networks that operate HD simulcast feeds through their primary distribution on cable and satellite television.\n\n====Subchannels====\n\n=====[[Qubo]]=====\n{{Main|Qubo}}\n[[Qubo]] is a children's television network that launched on January 8, 2007, and is carried on the second digital subchannel of Ion Television's stations. Its launch was announced on May 8, 2006, when Ion Media Networks, NBCUniversal, Nelvana, Scholastic Media, Classic Media (now [[DreamWorks Classics]] which would later be owned by NBCUniversal) and its [[Big Idea Productions]] unit announced plans to create Qubo as a multi-platform children's entertainment endeavor that would extend to a weekly programming block on Ion Television as well as NBC and Telemundo, and a [[video-on-demand]] service for [[digital cable]] providers.<ref name=\"ionmedia4\">{{cite press release|title=Press<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://www.ionmedia.tv/press/press.cfm?id=4|website=Ion Media Networks|date=May 8, 2006|access-date=July 7, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929195959/http://www.ionmedia.tv/press/press.cfm?id=4|archive-date=September 29, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> Qubo features content from the programming libraries of each of the partners, though there was an early promise of each company producing a new series for the network each year; most of its programs are targeted at children ages 2 to 11, though its late night programming block \"Qubo Night Owl\" (which originally featured animated series from Qubo's partners and the [[Filmation]] library, but since August 2013 features a mix of animated and live-action series sourced solely from the distribution partners) is aimed at older teenagers and adults.\n\nThe network debuted on January 8, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=How To Get Qubo Channel<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://www.qubo.com/qubo247.asp|website=[[Qubo]]|access-date=2006-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112055327/http://qubo.com/qubo247.asp|archive-date=2007-01-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> Its initial format was composed of a four-hour block of shows that repeated six times a day, all featuring programming exclusive to the new channel; by 2010, the channel adopted a more traditional schedule featuring a larger array of programs. As a consequence to the pending launch of Qubo, the ''i'' secondary feed was replaced on ''i'' O&Os with a repeating promo loop in late September 2006. NBCUniversal dropped out of the venture in 2011, with NBC and sister network Telemundo replacing their Qubo blocks with their own E/I-compliant [[NBC Kids|children's lineups]] programmed by [[Sprout (TV network)|PBS Kids Sprout]] (now [[Universal Kids]], which is part-owned by NBCUniversal's corporate parent [[Comcast]]) that July, relegating Qubo's companion programming block exclusively to Ion Television; Ion Media Networks acquired the stakes of the remaining partners in the channel, which all retained distribution partnerships with Qubo, in 2013.\n\nProgramming on Qubo Channel and its companion Ion Television block account for all educational programming content on Ion's owned-and-operated stations, thus relieving the network from the responsibility of carrying programs compliant with [[Children's Television Act]] guidelines on its other subchannel services.\n\n=====Ion Plus=====\n{{Main|Ion Plus}}\n[[Ion Plus]] (originally named \"iHealth\" prior to its launch and \"Ion Life\" until July 1, 2019) launched on February 19, 2007, and is carried on the third digital subchannel of Ion Television's stations. Under its former format, the network mainly featured health and lifestyle programs, as well as feature films on Sunday mornings and select weeknights (which consist mainly of those its parent network is scheduled to air during the given month as part of the \"Ion Television at the Movies\" block); some [[extreme sports]] programming previously aired on weekend evenings until July 2014. Much of Ion Life's programming consists of Canadian-imported programs, with some limited U.S.-produced programming. The network originally maintained a 24-hour entertainment schedule until 2013, when Ion Life added a limited number of infomercials in mid-morning and midday timeslots. As of July 1, 2019, it was rebranded to Ion Plus, and now acts as a ''de facto'' extension of the main Ion service, featuring all-day marathon scheduling of one series, along with the same scheduling of paid programming.\n\n=====Ion Shop=====\nIn April 2012, Ion Media Networks launched a new service known as ''Ion Shop'' (originally \"iShop\" prior to November 2012, and \"ShopTV\" thereafter, both are names used only by the [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]] identifiers on digital television tuners and converter boxes; there is no branding used by the channel itself); some Ion owned-and-operated stations, however, did not begin carrying the network until as late as that November. Carried as a fourth digital subchannel on Ion Television's owned-and-operated stations, it primarily carries informercials; until June 2013, Ion Shop also aired blocks of programming from Ion Life in some morning and late night timeslots.\n\n=====QVC Over the Air=====\n{{Main|QVC}}\nOn August 5, 2013, as part of a partnership between [[QVC]] and Ion Media Networks to expand the channel's broadcast television coverage, Ion Television began carrying the cable and satellite [[home shopping]] network via a fifth digital subchannel on most of its owned-and-operated stations. Although the network maintains a high-definition simulcast feed, QVC is transmitted in standard definition in order to preserve channel bandwidth to allow the primary Ion network feed to transmit in HD, with the normally [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] SD feed squeezed to full-screen in order to fit [[4:3]] television sets (preventing [[Windowbox (filmmaking)|windowboxing]] of the subchannel on 16:9 sets). QVC is also broadcast on digital subchannels of [[low-power broadcasting|low-powered television stations]] (mainly those not owned by Ion Media Networks) in selected areas, including in some areas where an Ion station also carries it. The channel's broadcast service is branded as \"QVC Over the Air\", with an accompanying [[digital on-screen graphic|on-screen bug]] appearing on the lower right corner of the screen during the network's programming. Some Ion-affiliated stations decline to carry QVC's programming, and some Ion Media-owned stations are unable to carry that network due to affiliation agreements between QVC and other broadcasters that existed prior to the Ion deal.\n\n=====Home Shopping Network=====\n{{Main|Home Shopping Network}}\nOn November 18, 2013, Ion Television began carrying the Home Shopping Network via a sixth digital subchannel on most of its owned-and-operated stations, as part of a partnership with Ion Media Networks (both once controlled by Lowell \"Bud\" Paxson) to expand the channel's broadcast coverage. Although it has a high definition simulcast feed, HSN is transmitted by Ion stations in standard definition, due to the same digital multiplexing limitations that prevent QVC from being carried in 16:9 SD or HD. HSN has been widely available over-the-air throughout the United States since its inception \u2013 through stations that the network had owned prior to the 1998 reorganization of its Silver King Broadcasting group into [[USA Broadcasting]] (some of which were converted into general entertainment independent outlets, and were later sold to [[Univision Communications]] to form the charter stations of the present-day UniM\u00e1s network), and had been mainly available on [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]] television stations immediately prior to its subchannel-leasing agreement with Ion; HSN is carried on low-power stations in some markets where an Ion station also carries the network, though HSN's programming is exclusive to an existing affiliate in a few areas where both networks are present (such as Atlanta, where [[WPXA-TV]] simulcasts [[Telemundo]] affiliate [[WKTB-CD]] on its DT6 subchannel under a time-leasing arrangement, and [[W45DX-D]] carries HSN).\n\n===National pay-TV feed===\nSeparate national feeds (formerly known as \"i Plus\" or \"Ion Plus\") have been made available to pay television providers [[Dish Network]], DirecTV, [[Time Warner Cable]], [[Comcast]] and [[Charter Communications]], and Ion Television stations not owned by Ion Media Networks, featuring programming sourced from Ion Life in place of paid programming that airs on the main network. Prior to the launch of Ion Life, the Ion Plus feeds carried reruns of cancelled Pax original programs (such as ''[[Miracle Pets]]'' and ''Beat the Clock''), as well as [[public domain]] movies and [[sitcom]] episodes (such as ''[[I Married Joan]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''). The feeds used the Pax name and [[Digital on-screen graphic|bug]] after the network's rebrand as ''i'', until about September 2005. As Ion has refocused towards its current schedule however, along with a de-emphasis on local advertising, the national feed effectively repeats Ion's main feed outside a lack of [[station identification]].  Dish Network removed Ion TV from their lineup due to being able to get it on local television.\n\n==Differences between Ion and other broadcast networks==\nCurrently, Ion follows programming strategy similar to major cable networks, with majority of its schedule being filled by acquired broadcast and cable drama series, few original programs, holiday films and other original movies, and theatrically released movies sourced mainly from major film studios, with its entertainment programming schedule occupying 18 hours of its daily broadcast schedule. Ion Television, unlike other broadcast networks, does not necessarily allow its owned-and-operated stations and affiliates to air syndicated programming during the daytime and late night hours.\n\nIn the United States, syndicated programming accounts for a majority of the revenue of local network-affiliated and independent stations. Network programming (on stations that have a network affiliation), newscasts or other locally produced programs (if a station carries any), and infomercials make up the rest. Since paid programming once made up a relatively sizable portion of Ion's schedule (prior to 2008), the benefit is that it provides the main source of revenue. However, this is also a drawback as, in the past, Ion had relied more on infomercials rather than sitcoms and dramas; sponsors of [[television series]] often have qualms about their message being lost on stations whose primary content is infomercials and other paid programming. Ion Television's reliance on mostly paid programming has decreased since the late 2000s, as a result of the network's expansion of entertainment programming to additional daytime and late night timeslots, and in particular, the later creation of the infomercial-dedicated subchannel service Ion Shop. Ion Television stations also lack locally produced programming; most of its stations had aired newscasts from other local network-affiliated stations until the rebrand as ''i'', and have even produced their own [[Public affairs (broadcasting)|community affairs]] shows; however, local programming has since become virtually non-existent on most of Ion's O&Os and affiliates.\n\nAs a result, there are a small number of stations (such as former affiliate [[WXVO-LD|WKFK-LD]] in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]]) that maintain dual affiliations with both Ion and another smaller network, usually either [[America One]] or MyNetworkTV. In early 2006, it was announced that the ''i'' stations in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] ([[WPXX-TV]]), [[Rapid City, South Dakota]] ([[KKRA-LP]]) and [[Greenville, North Carolina]] ([[WEPX-TV]], as well as its satellite [[WPXU-TV]] in [[Jacksonville, North Carolina]]) would add programming from MyNetworkTV in September 2006, causing preemptions of ''i'' programming during prime time due to the stations' programming commitments to carrying the MyNetworkTV schedule. This blow came after ''i'' lost some affiliates in [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Illinois]] entirely (although the New York station, [[WWBI-LP]] in [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]], subsequently rejoined the network after a sale that resulted in the affiliation change fell through).\n\nIn late September 2009, a year after Ion Media Networks purchased WPXX and WEPX/WPXU from Flinn Broadcasting, those stations resumed carrying Ion Television full-time, having disaffiliated from MyNetworkTV as a result of the network terminating its existing affiliation agreements due to its conversion into a programming service. NBC affiliate [[WITN-TV]] took over the MyNetworkTV affiliation for the Greenville, North Carolina market, placing it on a [[digital subchannel]]; Memphis CW affiliate [[WLMT]], meanwhile, picked up only ''[[WWE SmackDown]]'' in place of WPXX (that station would also add MyNetworkTV on a digital subchannel in a dual affiliation with [[MeTV]], but eventually dropped, leaving it on [[KPMF-LD]], which is licensed to the nearby [[Jonesboro, Arkansas]] market but transmits from the same tower as WLMT does north of Memphis, though it holds no cable coverage in the Memphis area).\n\n==Network slogans==\n* ''Pax TV: A Friend of the Family'' (1998\u20132000)\n* ''Pax TV: Share It With Someone You Love'' (1998\u20132000)\n* ''Pax TV: Share The Wonder'' (2000\u20132002)\n* ''Pax TV: Feel Good TV'' (2002\u20132003)\n* ''Pax TV: Feel The Spirit'' (2003\u20132004)\n* ''Pax TV: Oh What a Night!''

The network first began broadcasting on August 31, 1998 as '''Pax TV''' (commonly referred to as \"Pax\"; stylized as '''PAX'''), focusing primarily on family-oriented entertainment programming; it rebranded as '''i: Independent Television''' (commonly referred to as \"i\"; stylized as '''''i''''') on July 1, 2005, converting into a general entertainment network featuring mainly recent and older acquired programs; the network adopted its current identity as Ion Television on January 29, 2007.\n\nIon Television is available throughout most of the United States through its group of 62 [[owned-and-operated station]]s, as well as through distribution on cable and satellite providers; since 2014, the network has also increased affiliate distribution in several markets through the [[digital subchannel]]s of local television stations owned by companies such as [[NBC Owned Television Stations|NBCUniversal]] and [[Nexstar Media Group]] where the network is unable to maintain a main channel affiliation with or own a standalone station, for the same purpose as the distribution of Ion's main network feed via cable and satellite.

Paxson, who felt that television programs aired by other broadcast networks were too raunchy and not family-friendly enough, had decided to create a network that he perceived as an alternative. Since the new network would focus on programming tailored to family audiences, PAX maintained a considerably more conservative programming content policy than the major commercial television networks, restricting [[profanity]], [[violence]] and sexual content; accordingly, many of the network's acquired programs were edited to remove sexual and overt violent content, while profane language was [[ducking|muted]].\n\nMost of the network's initial affiliates were Paxson Communications-owned affiliate stations of the '''Infomall TV Network''' (inTV), a network launched by Paxson in 1995 that relied mainly on [[infomercial]]s and other [[brokered programming]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Paxson's IN TV: move over UPN, WB (Lowell Paxson predicts that his Infomall TV Network will out perform United Paramount Network and WB Network)|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16217997.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105130932/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16217997.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|periodical=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information|Cahners Business Information]]|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=January 23, 1995|url-access=subscription }}</ref> During the late spring and summer of 1998, a half-hour preview special hosted by former ''[[The Waltons|Waltons]]'' star [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]], featuring interviews with Lowell Paxson about PAX's development and initial programming, aired on inTV stations slated to become charter outlets of the new network.\n\nPAX launched on August 31, 1998,<ref>{{cite news|title=Pax TV to offer family programming|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4458284.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105132226/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4458284.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group|American Publishing Company]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=August 16, 1998|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=On Monday, the Genesis of PAX TV|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-668142.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610170848/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-668142.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 10, 2014|author=Lisa de Moraes|newspaper=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post Company|via=HighBeam Research|date=August 29, 1998|accessdate=February 25, 2013|url-access=subscription }}</ref> with the network's initial schedule being much larger in scope than it would be in later years.

Through an agreement with then-[[Disney]] owned animation studio [[DIC Productions L.P.]], its schedule also included a children's program block called \"Cloud Nine\" on Saturdays from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and Sundays from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. Central.<ref name=\"Pax SFGate\">{{cite news|title=PAX Going For Piece Of TV Pie|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/PAX-Going-For-Piece-Of-TV-Pie-2994282.php|author=John Carman|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Chronicle Publishing Company]]|date=August 28, 1998|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}</ref><ref name name=awm>Issue 3.2. {{cite news|title=DIC Pacts With PAX|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.2/3.2pages/3.2television.html|periodical=Animation World Magazine|date=May 1998|accessdate=March 1, 2014}}</ref> In addition, the network aired religious programming through time-lease agreements with [[The Worship Network]] (which aired its overnight programming on PAX seven nights a week) and Praise TV (featuring [[Contemporary Christian music]] and other faith-based programs aimed at teenagers and young adults, which aired on Friday and Saturday late-nights from 11:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. Central until 2000). The remainder of the schedule was filled by paid programming.\n\nInitial programming on PAX consisted of first-run shows (such as the true story profile series ''[[It's a Miracle (TV series)|It's a Miracle]]'', [[game show]] ''[[The Reel to Reel Picture Show]]'', and [[talk show]]s ''Woman's Day'' and ''Great Day America''), along with reruns of older programming (including ''[[Highway to Heaven]]'', ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', ''[[The Hogan Family]]'', ''[[Dave's World]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', and new episodes and older reruns of ''[[Candid Camera]]'', the latter of which moved to the network following the revival series' cancellation by [[CBS]] earlier in 1998). The network also produced some original drama series such as ''[[Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye]]'', ''[[Doc (2001 TV series)|Doc]]'', ''[[Mysterious Ways (TV series)|Mysterious Ways]]'' (which originated on [[NBC]]), ''[[Hope Island (TV series)|Hope Island]]'' and ''[[Twice in a Lifetime (TV series)|Twice in a Lifetime]]'' through its programming division, Paxson Productions. PAX also aired many game shows including first-run revivals of established games that originated on cable networks such as ''[[Supermarket Sweep]]'' and ''[[Shop 'til You Drop]]'', along with some original game shows such as ''[[On the Cover (game show)|On the Cover]]'', ''[[Balderdash (game show)|Balderdash]]'', a 2002 revival of ''[[Beat the Clock]]'', ''[[Hollywood Showdown]]'' (in conjunction with [[Game Show Network]], which also aired the show) and reruns of ''[[Born Lucky]]''. The network would later carry reruns of the syndicated revival of ''[[Family Feud]]'' (consisting of episodes from [[Louie Anderson]], [[Richard Karn]] and [[John O'Hurley]]'s tenures as host, airing on a one-year delay from their original syndication broadcast) and, due to its alliance with NBC, ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' (both from the [[Anne Robinson]]-hosted network run and the [[George Gray (TV host)|George Gray]]-hosted syndicated version) as well as the 2000 revival of ''[[Twenty One (game show)|Twenty-One]]''.\n\nIn September 1999, NBC purchased a 32% share of Paxson Communications for $415 million in convertible stock, with an option to expand its interest to 49% by February 2002, pending changes in ownership regulations set by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) that would allow it to acquire additional television stations.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Media Business: NBC Completes Acquisition Of 32% Stake in Paxson|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/17/business/the-media-business-nbc-completes-acquisition-of-32-stake-in-paxson.html|author=[[Bill Carter]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=September 17, 1999|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref> NBC later sold its share in the network back to Paxson in November 2003.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Media Business: Advertising; NBC Moves to Break Up Relationship with Paxson|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/14/business/the-media-business-advertising-nbc-moves-to-break-up-relationship-with-paxson.html|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 14, 2003|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn lieu of a national news program, in 2000, Paxson Communications signed an agreement with [[Jackson, Mississippi]]-based [[WeatherVision]] \u2013 which mainly produces weather forecast inserts for television stations in certain markets that do not operate an in-house news department or maintain a news share agreement with another local station \u2013 to produce ''Tomorrow's Weather Tonight'', a five-minute national forecast segment that aired Monday through Friday nights at the conclusion of PAX's entertainment schedule. Starting in 2001, many PAX stations also entered into news share agreements with a local major network affiliate (mostly involving NBC-affiliated stations, though some involved an affiliate of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] or CBS) to air [[broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] broadcasts of evening, and in some markets, morning newscasts from the partner station; in a few cases, the agreement partner produced live newscasts for the PAX station (as examples of the latter, NBC affiliate [[WTHR]] in [[Indianapolis]] produced a prime time newscast for PAX O&O [[WIPX-TV]] from February to June 2005, after CBS affiliate [[WISH-TV]] (now a [[The CW|CW]] affiliate) took over production of the newscast that WTHR had been producing for [[UPN]] affiliate [[WNDY-TV]] (now a [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate) since 1996; [[Cleveland]] NBC affiliate [[WKYC|WKYC-TV]] produced evening newscasts for WVPX-TV that focused primarily on that O&O's city of license, nearby [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]). In some cities, a major network affiliate also provided some engineering and other back office services for the PAX station.\n\nIn an effort to increase revenue due to low viewership and other financial issues, PAX gradually increased the amount of paid programming content on its schedule throughout the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], at the expense of its general entertainment programming. Infomercials and other types of brokered programs ultimately became the dominant form of programming during the network's broadcast day; by January 2005: the time that PAX had allocated to entertainment programs had been reduced to six hours on weekdays (from 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.) and five hours on weekends (from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Central Time). Original programming was also affected by the network's programming changes; PAX was originally offering five or six new series each season. However, in 2003, the number of new series that aired on PAX dwindled to just two: ''[[Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye]]'', which was cancelled in 2005, and ''Doc'', which was cancelled in 2004 after PAX's international backer, Canadian broadcast network [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], pulled out of producing the shows. The network seemingly recovered a year later when seven series made it to PAX's 2004\u201305 schedule.\n\n===''i'' (2005\u20132007)===\nOn June 28, 2005, Paxson Communications announced that it would rebrand PAX as '''i: Independent Television''' (commonly referred to as \"i\", stylized as ''i''), in order to reflect a new strategy of \"providing an independent broadcast platform for producers and syndicators who desire to reach a national audience.\" After the transition was complete, the network would continue to air programming under its Pax brand on one of its [[digital subchannel]]s over-the-air and on select cable providers (see [[#Ion Plus|below]]).\n\nThe rebranding also resulted in several changes to its programming lineup: infomercials replaced overnight programming from The Worship Network, which began to carry its full 24-hour schedule on a fourth digital subchannel of local ''i'' owned-and-operated stations and affiliates until the network was dropped in January 2010, in addition, ''Tomorrow's Weather Tonight'' and rebroadcasts of network affiliate newscasts were discontinued the day prior to the rebrand on June 30, 2005 (though a few stations not owned by the network's parent company retained news share agreements with major network stations after that date, such as [[WBNA]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], which continues to air newscasts from NBC affiliate [[WAVE (TV)|WAVE]] as of January 2015). The network shifted its format almost entirely to reruns of television series from the 1960s to the 1990s (such as ''[[Green Acres]]'', ''[[Amen (TV series)|Amen]]'', and Pax holdover ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'') and feature films, reruns of former Pax TV series (such as ''Doc'') and first-run episodes (and later reruns) of Pax holdover series ''[[America's Most Talented Kid]]s'' were also included as part of the schedule. In turn, the network adapted its programming content standards to those similar to other broadcast networks. During the 2005\u201306 season, the network launched only one new series that met the network's new mission of being an 'independent broadcast platform', the teen drama ''[[Palmetto Pointe]]'', which only lasted six episodes; the network went entirely to a lineup of reruns for the 2006\u201307 season (except for ''Health Report'' and Ion Life specials).\n\nIn November 2005, [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]] was granted a transferable option to purchase a controlling stake in Paxson Communications.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Had this option been exercised, NBC would have acquired approximately 63 ''i'' owned-and-operated stations (though this could have resulted in a forced divestiture of either ''i'' or [[Spanish language]] network [[Telemundo]], which NBC had acquired in April 2002 (prior to its merger with [[Vivendi Universal]]), along with the divested network's O&Os due to FCC rules that prohibit broadcasters from [[duopoly (broadcasting)#Triopolies and quadropolies|owning more than two television stations in the same market]] unless there are either a minimum of 20 full-power stations in the market or one of the stations is a [[broadcast relay station#Satellite stations|satellite]]). As part of the agreement, Lowell Paxson stepped down from his position as chairman of Paxson Communications.

The satellite provider cited that \"most of [''i'' Network's] programming consists of infomercials and other promotional shows\", despite an earlier promise by network executives that it \"would consist of general, family-oriented entertainment\". To appease DirecTV management, the network decided to drop some infomercials and shopping programs, and replace them with older [[public domain]] programs and cancelled Pax TV original series. The network and its stations were expected to be removed from the service by February 28, 2006. However, DirecTV and Ion Media Networks reached a new carriage agreement that May.\n\n===Ion Television (2007\u2013present)===\nOn January 29, 2007, the network changed its name again to '''Ion Television''' (as a result of its parent company's renaming to Ion Media Networks).

The network also aired a late afternoon sitcom block called \"Laugh Attack\", which featured reruns of comedy series targeted at [[African American]] audiences (originally consisting of ''[[Hangin' with Mr. Cooper]]'' and ''[[The Wayans Bros.]]'', the latter of which was later replaced by ''[[The Steve Harvey Show]]'').{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn January 2008, Ion Media and [[Comcast]] reached a carriage agreement to continue carrying Ion Television, while also adding [[Qubo]] and [[Ion Life]] to the cable provider's channel lineups.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ion Media Plugs In New Comcast Accord|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6522639.html|periodical=[[Multichannel News]]|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=2008-01-14}}</ref>\n\n====2008 relaunch====\nOn May 1, 2008, Ion Television held an upfront presentation announcing its programming for the 2008\u201309 season at the [[New York Public Library]] in [[Manhattan]].

More recent theatrically released feature films were also added to the lineup, alongside older movie releases from the 1980s and 1990s.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn April 2009, it was announced that Ion Media Networks was once again facing [[balance sheet]] problems.

It provides general entertainment programming to owned-and-operated and affiliated stations Monday through Thursdays from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m., Fridays from 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m., and Saturdays and Sundays from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. Central Time (the entertainment programming schedule starts six hours later and ends two hours earlier from Christmas to [[New Year's Day]], with paid programming filling the remaining vacated hours). A children's programming block known as the [[Qubo|Qubo Kids' Corner]] \u2013 which features programs compliant with FCC [[E/I|educational programming]] requirements \u2013 airs for three hours each Friday at 7:00 a.m. Central Time. All other time periods are filled with religious programming or infomercials.\n\nIon owned-and-operated stations and affiliates also provide limited [[local programming]] on weekday mornings to fulfill [[Public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] guidelines, which range from entirely local productions to Ion Life-sourced programs within which commercial slots are instead devoted to local physicians or experts giving locality-specific health advice or advertising their services. Ion also served as the over-the-air broadcast distribution point for [[TiVo]]'s ''Teleworld Paid Program'', a weekly 30-minute compilation program \u2013 usually carried during the overnight on Wednesdays or Thursdays within the network's designated paid programming time \u2013 it was specifically coded to distribute [[promo (media)|program previews]] and device tutorials for TiVo's [[digital video recorder]]s. TiVo discontinued the program in 2016 as broadband had become commonplace enough to end it.\n\nMost programs broadcast by Ion Television are distributed by either [[20th Century Fox Television]] or [[CBS Television Distribution]]. Ion Television also maintains film distribution deals with [[Paramount Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]]<ref name=deals>{{cite web|title=Ion Adds \"M*A*S*H\" to Weekdays, Ion Announces New Deals with Studios|url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/blog/2010/02/ion-adds-mash-to-weekdays-ion-announces.html|website=Sitcoms Online|date=February 16, 2010}}</ref> Series currently broadcast by Ion Television ({{as of|October 2015|lc=y}}) comprise mostly of dramas such as ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', ''[[Law & Order]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]'', ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numb3rs]]'', ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]'', and ''[[The Listener (TV series)|The Listener]]''. As of 2014, the network's format is predominantly devoted to marathon blocks of hour-long drama series, with consecutive episodes of a given series airing between two and 16 hours a day (depending on the day's schedule, with fewer hours in the morning and late fringe).\n\nThe network broadcasts [[feature film]]s released between the 1980s and the 2000s under the banner \"Ion Television at the Movies\", which fill the majority of the network's Sunday afternoon and evening schedule ([[Christmas and holiday season|holiday]]-themed made-for-TV films are also broadcast under the banner throughout the entertainment programming day on weekends between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as well as on [[Christmas Eve]] and Christmas Day regardless of where either holiday falls during the calendar week). Ion Television occasionally airs short hosted segments during its [[prime time]] lineup \u2013 particularly during film presentations \u2013 known as the \"Ion Lounge\", a lifestyle segment used mainly to advertise a company's product within the featured program's commercial breaks.\n\nIn the recent past, Ion Television has aired a limited number of comedy or comedy-drama series that were cycled on-and-off the schedule such as ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', ''[[Psych]]'' and ''[[Married... with Children]]'', with half-hour sitcoms used on certain occasions to [[Filler (media)|fill scheduling gaps]] prior to the telecast of its late-morning film presentations (usually in the 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Central Time half-hour, if the succeeding film ran for at least 2{{frac|1|2}} hours) due to their erratic scheduling; the network shifted to a more exclusive focus on dramas as part of its series content in January 2015, although the network continues to carry comedic programming in the form of select feature films aired within the \"Ion Television at the Movies\" block.\n\nIon's current method of running predominately [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming is very similar to the international model of broadcasting used in [[Europe]], [[Canada]], [[Latin America]], [[Asia]] and [[Australia]], which mixes imported and syndicated shows with original programming \u2013 a model used only in [[Television in the United States|United States broadcast television]] by digital multicast services (particularly those that specialize in acquired programs such as [[MeTV]]), smaller English language entertainment-based networks (such as [[America One]]) and networks broadcasting in languages other than [[English language|English]] (such as [[Univision]] and Telemundo). The major commercial broadcast networks in the U.S. \u2013 ABC, NBC, CBS, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and The CW \u2013 carry first-run programs produced for the network, while leaving the responsibility of acquiring shows from the syndication market to their owned-and-operated stations and affiliates to fill time not allotted to network and, where applicable, locally produced programs (MyNetworkTV, which is somewhat similar to Ion Television in its format, mixes elements of both models as acquired programs are supplied both during prime time by the service and by its stations at all other times). A limited number of non-Ion-owned stations that are merely affiliated with the network (such as Louisville outlet WBNA) do carry additional local or syndicated programming that, in some instances, pre-empts certain programs within the Ion master schedule.\n\n===Recent programming deals===\nIn 2006, Ion Media Networks reached several programming deals, two with major programming suppliers that were announced within a week of each other, and another that among other things would bring original programming to Ion Television's lineup. On June 27, 2006, Ion Media announced a comprehensive programming deal with [[Warner Bros.

Meanwhile, three series from CBS Television Distribution were added to the schedule: ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' joined the lineup in September 2008, while ''Criminal Minds'' and ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' were added to the Ion Television lineup in 2009.

In some markets, [[DirecTV]] carries a \"placeholder\" simulcast of the national modified feed of the network (for example, [[Los Angeles]] area viewers can watch Ion on both channels 30, via local O&O [[KPXN-TV]], and 305; [[New York City]] on channel 31 [[WPXN-TV|WPXN]] besides 305).\n\n===Major market absences and station oddities===\nIon Television does not have any over-the-air stations in several major [[media market|markets]], most notably [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]] ([[Verizon FiOS]] subscribers in [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]] receive the network's [[Washington, D.C.]] affiliate [[WPXW-TV]] as a default affiliate) and, [[KSWB-TV#Digital_television|prior to February 2020]],  San Diego, California.\n\nTwo major factors that have limited the network's national broadcast coverage are that unlike the major commercial broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and The CW), Ion did not actively seek over-the-air distribution on the [[digital subchannel]]s of other network-affiliated stations in the five years following the digital television transition (with limited exceptions in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]], [[Tucson, Arizona]] and [[Fresno, California]] through agreements with [[Telemundo]] [[KBLR (TV)|owned-and-]][[KNSO|operated]] [[KHRR|stations]] in those markets), until it reached a multi-station agreement with [[Media General]] in November 2015;<ref name=\"aas-ionkxan\">{{cite news|title=New broadcast TV network hits Austin's airwaves|url=http://www.mystatesman.com/news/entertainment/dinges-new-broadcast-tv-network-hits-austins-airwa/npMDg/|author=Gary Dinges|newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|publisher=[[Cox Enterprises]]|date=November 14, 2015|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}</ref> prior to that deal, it long had very few stations that [[network affiliate|contractually carry]] the network's programming (with limited exceptions in markets such as Louisville, Kentucky and [[Anchorage, Alaska]]). As a result, Ion Media Networks owns the vast majority of the stations within Ion Television's affiliate body, as well as those of co-owned multicast services Qubo Channel and Ion Life.\n\nIn [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], a deal by Paxson to buy [[WPCB-TV]] and trade it for secondary [[PBS]] member station WQEX was approved by the Federal Communications Commission, but rejected by WPCB-TV owner [[Cornerstone Television]] in a 2000 [[WINP-TV#Controversy|controversy]]; it would not be until November 2010 that Paxson's successor, Ion Media Networks, would successfully buy WQEX, which has since been converted into a commercially licensed outlet as Ion O&O [[WINP-TV]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ion to Buy WQEX: \"Positively entertaining\" network grabs Pittsburgh outlet|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/ion-buy-wqex/42607|author=Michael Malone|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=November 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ion Buying WQEX Pittsburgh For $3 Million|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/46835/ion-buying-wqex-pittsburgh-for-3-million|author=Harry A.

Under an agreement with [[Fox Television Stations]], Ion was added to a DT4 feed of Fox affiliate [[WJZY-TV]] (then owned-and-operated by Fox) on September 29, 2016.  Ion in Charlotte later moved to the DT6 feed of WJZY-TV.\n\n[[St. Louis]], at one time, received the network by way of a [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]] repeater of O&O [[WPXS]] in nearby [[Mount Vernon, Illinois]]; in December 2013, the [[United States bankruptcy court]] approved a plan by creditors of [[Roberts Broadcasting]] to transfer [[East St. Louis, Illinois|East St. Louis]]-based MyNetworkTV affiliate [[WRBU]] and its sister stations, CW affiliate [[WZRB]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]] and former CW affiliate [[WAZE-TV|WAZE-LP]] in [[Evansville, Indiana]], to a trust with Ion Media Networks \u2013 a creditor in Roberts' [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] proceedings, for which it filed in 2011 \u2013 that would serve as its beneficiary.

WAZE-LP was [[dark (broadcasting)|silent]] at the time of acquisition, having gone dark the previous year after failing to construct its digital transmitter facilities, and Ion eventually decided on an affiliation deal with [[Nexstar Media Group]]'s cluster in the area instead, using a subchannel of CW affiliate [[WTVW]].\n\n[[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Rochester, New York]], normally treated as separate markets, share Ion affiliate [[WPXJ-TV]], which is centrally located between the two cities and is licensed to [[Batavia, New York|Batavia]]. An equivalent case exists involving [[Battle Creek, Michigan]]-licensed [[WZPX-TV]], which serves both the [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] and [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] markets (it also unusually served as a secondary [[The WB|WB]] affiliate due to a lack of stations in both markets until the digital age); additionally, [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]-licensed [[WPXD-TV]] also once provided an equivalent over-the-air signal for Lansing before moving their signal to a new transmitter in the Detroit suburb of [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]] in 2012.\n\nIn addition, in several other markets, Ion's predecessor was sold to another television station group to affiliate with a different English or Spanish language network, and through either a lack of channel space or interest in the network, Ion would not reappear in most of those markets until reaching deals to air on digital subchannels of other stations. These include:\n* [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]: KAPX (now [[UniM\u00e1s]] owned-and-operated station [[KTFQ-DT|KTFQ]], Ion now on [[KWBQ]] 19.4)\n* [[Baraboo, Wisconsin]]: [[W43BR]] (now a [[The Family Channel (American TV network)|Family Channel]] affiliate, Ion now in Madison on [[WISC-TV|WISC]] 3.3)\n* [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]: [[WLFT-CD]] (now a [[Independent station (North America)|religious independent station]], Ion now on [[WVLA-TV|WVLA]] 33.3)\n* [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]\u2013[[Springfield, Illinois]]: WPXU (now CW affiliate [[WBUI]], Ion now on [[WAND]] 17.3)\n* [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]: WADA-LP (now [[WVIR-CD]] (translator of NBC affiliate [[WVIR-TV]]), Ion now on [[WCAV]] 19.4)\n* [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]\u2013[[Visalia, California]]: KPXF (now UniM\u00e1s owned-and-operated station [[KTFF-DT|KTFF]], Ion now on [[KNSO]] 51.3)\n* [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]: KYPX (now [[MeTV]] affiliate [[KMYA-DT|KMYA]]; Ion now on [[KARZ-TV|KARZ]] 42.3)\n* [[Montgomery, Alabama]]: [[WBMM]] (first switched to [[Daystar (TV network)|Daystar]], now a CW affiliate, Ion now on [[WAKA (TV)|WAKA]] 8.3)\n* [[Reno, Nevada]]: [[KREN-TV|KREN]] (now an Univision affiliate, Ion now on [[KTVN]] 2.3)\n* [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]: [[KPXJ]] (now a CW affiliate, Ion now on [[KSHV-TV|KSHV]] 45.3)\n* [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]: [[KAUN-LP]] (now a Retro TV affiliate, Ion now on [[KELO-TV|KELO]] 11.3)\n* [[Tucson, Arizona]]: [[KUVE-DT]] (now an Univision owned-and-operated station, Ion now on [[KOLD-TV|KOLD]] 13.4)\n\nIn November 2015, [[Media General]] and Ion came to terms on an affiliation deal to add Ion's main feed as a standard definition digital subchannel in non-Ion O&O markets with Media General stations to replace the programming of the long-defunct [[Live Well Network]], the first of its kind for Ion. Ion subchannels were added in markets such as [[Austin, Texas]]; [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]; [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]; [[Lafayette, Indiana]]; [[Davenport, Iowa]]; [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]; [[Lansing, Michigan]]; [[Richmond, Virginia]]; [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]; and [[Wichita, Kansas]].<ref name=\"aas-ionkxan\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=KWQC Davenport Adds Ion TV On Subchannel|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/89578/kwqc-davenport-adds-ion-tv-on-subchannel|author=Mark K. Miller|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=October 28, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}</ref> These deals would carry over after the Media General stations were integrated into the [[Nexstar Media Group]] in January 2017, with WBAY-TV continuing to carry Ion under [[Gray Television]] ownership. [[Morgan Murphy Media]]'s two Wisconsin stations ([[WISC-TV]]/[[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] and [[WKBT-DT]]/[[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]]\u2013[[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]]) began to carry the network as a third subchannel at the beginning of February 2017. The network further expanded its affiliate reach into small and lower-ranked mid-sized markets during late 2016 and 2017, with Ion Media striking additional deals with companies such as Gray Television, [[Hubbard Broadcasting]], [[Block Communications]], [[Forum Communications]], [[Heartland Media]] and the [[Meredith Corporation]] to carry Ion Television on digital subchannels of stations owned and/or operated by those groups.\n\nIn several markets, the station's [[city of license]] is considered outside the main portion of a market's metropolitan area. Such cases include [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], where that area's Ion owned-and-operated station, [[KPXM-TV]], is licensed to [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]] ({{convert|60|mi|km}} northwest of the Twin Cities); [[Detroit]], where O&O [[WPXD-TV]] is licensed to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] ({{convert|40|mi|km}} west of Detroit), though its digital transmitter is located in Southfield, where the bulk of Detroit's television stations base their studios and transmitter facilities; [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], where O&O [[WHPX-TV]] is licensed to [[New London, Connecticut]] (located {{convert|40|mi|km}} to the southeast); and [[Milwaukee]], where O&O [[WPXE-TV]] is licensed to [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]], with its digital transmitter located at a tower farm on Milwaukee's north side (its former analog transmitter was located south of the city in [[Racine County, Wisconsin|Racine County]]). In the Cleveland market, Ion airs on Akron-based WVPX-TV, which had formerly targeted Akron, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] and nearby areas as an ABC affiliate (then competing with the market's existing ABC station [[WEWS-TV|WEWS]]) prior to 1998.\n\n==Related services==\n\n===Multiplexing===\nIon Television's stations have made notable use of \"[[multiplexing]]\", or splitting a digital broadcast television signal into separate [[digital subchannel|subchannels]]. The network's stations usually carry up to six of these digital subchannels (in contrast with most other full-power stations, which usually carry a maximum of four channels over the same signal), each of which broadcast separate networks. Due to the bandwidth limitations caused by its carriage of multiple subchannels over a single broadcast signal, only the primary Ion network feed is transmitted in high definition, even though most of its stations transmit two networks that operate HD simulcast feeds through their primary distribution on cable and satellite television.\n\n====Subchannels====\n\n=====[[Qubo]]=====\n{{Main|Qubo}}\n[[Qubo]] is a children's television network that launched on January 8, 2007, and is carried on the second digital subchannel of Ion Television's stations. Its launch was announced on May 8, 2006, when Ion Media Networks, NBCUniversal, Nelvana, Scholastic Media, Classic Media (now [[DreamWorks Classics]] which would later be owned by NBCUniversal) and its [[Big Idea Productions]] unit announced plans to create Qubo as a multi-platform children's entertainment endeavor that would extend to a weekly programming block on Ion Television as well as NBC and Telemundo, and a [[video-on-demand]] service for [[digital cable]] providers.<ref name=\"ionmedia4\">{{cite press release|title=Press<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://www.ionmedia.tv/press/press.cfm?id=4|website=Ion Media Networks|date=May 8, 2006|access-date=July 7, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929195959/http://www.ionmedia.tv/press/press.cfm?id=4|archive-date=September 29, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> Qubo features content from the programming libraries of each of the partners, though there was an early promise of each company producing a new series for the network each year; most of its programs are targeted at children ages 2 to 11, though its late night programming block \"Qubo Night Owl\" (which originally featured animated series from Qubo's partners and the [[Filmation]] library, but since August 2013 features a mix of animated and live-action series sourced solely from the distribution partners) is aimed at older teenagers and adults.\n\nThe network debuted on January 8, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=How To Get Qubo Channel<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://www.qubo.com/qubo247.asp|website=[[Qubo]]|access-date=2006-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112055327/http://qubo.com/qubo247.asp|archive-date=2007-01-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> Its initial format was composed of a four-hour block of shows that repeated six times a day, all featuring programming exclusive to the new channel; by 2010, the channel adopted a more traditional schedule featuring a larger array of programs. As a consequence to the pending launch of Qubo, the ''i'' secondary feed was replaced on ''i'' O&Os with a repeating promo loop in late September 2006. NBCUniversal dropped out of the venture in 2011, with NBC and sister network Telemundo replacing their Qubo blocks with their own E/I-compliant [[NBC Kids|children's lineups]] programmed by [[Sprout (TV network)|PBS Kids Sprout]] (now [[Universal Kids]], which is part-owned by NBCUniversal's corporate parent [[Comcast]]) that July, relegating Qubo's companion programming block exclusively to Ion Television; Ion Media Networks acquired the stakes of the remaining partners in the channel, which all retained distribution partnerships with Qubo, in 2013.\n\nProgramming on Qubo Channel and its companion Ion Television block account for all educational programming content on Ion's owned-and-operated stations, thus relieving the network from the responsibility of carrying programs compliant with [[Children's Television Act]] guidelines on its other subchannel services.\n\n=====Ion Plus=====\n{{Main|Ion Plus}}\n[[Ion Plus]] (originally named \"iHealth\" prior to its launch and \"Ion Life\" until July 1, 2019) launched on February 19, 2007, and is carried on the third digital subchannel of Ion Television's stations. Under its former format, the network mainly featured health and lifestyle programs, as well as feature films on Sunday mornings and select weeknights (which consist mainly of those its parent network is scheduled to air during the given month as part of the \"Ion Television at the Movies\" block); some [[extreme sports]] programming previously aired on weekend evenings until July 2014. Much of Ion Life's programming consists of Canadian-imported programs, with some limited U.S.-produced programming. The network originally maintained a 24-hour entertainment schedule until 2013, when Ion Life added a limited number of infomercials in mid-morning and midday timeslots. As of July 1, 2019, it was rebranded to Ion Plus, and now acts as a ''de facto'' extension of the main Ion service, featuring all-day marathon scheduling of one series, along with the same scheduling of paid programming.\n\n=====Ion Shop=====\nIn April 2012, Ion Media Networks launched a new service known as ''Ion Shop'' (originally \"iShop\" prior to November 2012, and \"ShopTV\" thereafter, both are names used only by the [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]] identifiers on digital television tuners and converter boxes; there is no branding used by the channel itself); some Ion owned-and-operated stations, however, did not begin carrying the network until as late as that November. Carried as a fourth digital subchannel on Ion Television's owned-and-operated stations, it primarily carries informercials; until June 2013, Ion Shop also aired blocks of programming from Ion Life in some morning and late night timeslots.\n\n=====QVC Over the Air=====\n{{Main|QVC}}\nOn August 5, 2013, as part of a partnership between [[QVC]] and Ion Media Networks to expand the channel's broadcast television coverage, Ion Television began carrying the cable and satellite [[home shopping]] network via a fifth digital subchannel on most of its owned-and-operated stations. Although the network maintains a high-definition simulcast feed, QVC is transmitted in standard definition in order to preserve channel bandwidth to allow the primary Ion network feed to transmit in HD, with the normally [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] SD feed squeezed to full-screen in order to fit [[4:3]] television sets (preventing [[Windowbox (filmmaking)|windowboxing]] of the subchannel on 16:9 sets). QVC is also broadcast on digital subchannels of [[low-power broadcasting|low-powered television stations]] (mainly those not owned by Ion Media Networks) in selected areas, including in some areas where an Ion station also carries it. The channel's broadcast service is branded as \"QVC Over the Air\", with an accompanying [[digital on-screen graphic|on-screen bug]] appearing on the lower right corner of the screen during the network's programming. Some Ion-affiliated stations decline to carry QVC's programming, and some Ion Media-owned stations are unable to carry that network due to affiliation agreements between QVC and other broadcasters that existed prior to the Ion deal.\n\n=====Home Shopping Network=====\n{{Main|Home Shopping Network}}\nOn November 18, 2013, Ion Television began carrying the Home Shopping Network via a sixth digital subchannel on most of its owned-and-operated stations, as part of a partnership with Ion Media Networks (both once controlled by Lowell \"Bud\" Paxson) to expand the channel's broadcast coverage. Although it has a high definition simulcast feed, HSN is transmitted by Ion stations in standard definition, due to the same digital multiplexing limitations that prevent QVC from being carried in 16:9 SD or HD. HSN has been widely available over-the-air throughout the United States since its inception \u2013 through stations that the network had owned prior to the 1998 reorganization of its Silver King Broadcasting group into [[USA Broadcasting]] (some of which were converted into general entertainment independent outlets, and were later sold to [[Univision Communications]] to form the charter stations of the present-day UniM\u00e1s network), and had been mainly available on [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]] television stations immediately prior to its subchannel-leasing agreement with Ion; HSN is carried on low-power stations in some markets where an Ion station also carries the network, though HSN's programming is exclusive to an existing affiliate in a few areas where both networks are present (such as Atlanta, where [[WPXA-TV]] simulcasts [[Telemundo]] affiliate [[WKTB-CD]] on its DT6 subchannel under a time-leasing arrangement, and [[W45DX-D]] carries HSN).\n\n===National pay-TV feed===\nSeparate national feeds (formerly known as \"i Plus\" or \"Ion Plus\") have been made available to pay television providers [[Dish Network]], DirecTV, [[Time Warner Cable]], [[Comcast]] and [[Charter Communications]], and Ion Television stations not owned by Ion Media Networks, featuring programming sourced from Ion Life in place of paid programming that airs on the main network. Prior to the launch of Ion Life, the Ion Plus feeds carried reruns of cancelled Pax original programs (such as ''[[Miracle Pets]]'' and ''Beat the Clock''), as well as [[public domain]] movies and [[sitcom]] episodes (such as ''[[I Married Joan]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''). The feeds used the Pax name and [[Digital on-screen graphic|bug]] after the network's rebrand as ''i'', until about September 2005. As Ion has refocused towards its current schedule however, along with a de-emphasis on local advertising, the national feed effectively repeats Ion's main feed outside a lack of [[station identification]].  Dish Network removed Ion TV from their lineup due to being able to get it on local television.\n\n==Differences between Ion and other broadcast networks==\nCurrently, Ion follows programming strategy similar to major cable networks, with majority of its schedule being filled by acquired broadcast and cable drama series, few original programs, holiday films and other original movies, and theatrically released movies sourced mainly from major film studios, with its entertainment programming schedule occupying 18 hours of its daily broadcast schedule. Ion Television, unlike other broadcast networks, does not necessarily allow its owned-and-operated stations and affiliates to air syndicated programming during the daytime and late night hours.\n\nIn the United States, syndicated programming accounts for a majority of the revenue of local network-affiliated and independent stations. Network programming (on stations that have a network affiliation), newscasts or other locally produced programs (if a station carries any), and infomercials make up the rest. Since paid programming once made up a relatively sizable portion of Ion's schedule (prior to 2008), the benefit is that it provides the main source of revenue. However, this is also a drawback as, in the past, Ion had relied more on infomercials rather than sitcoms and dramas; sponsors of [[television series]] often have qualms about their message being lost on stations whose primary content is infomercials and other paid programming. Ion Television's reliance on mostly paid programming has decreased since the late 2000s, as a result of the network's expansion of entertainment programming to additional daytime and late night timeslots, and in particular, the later creation of the infomercial-dedicated subchannel service Ion Shop. Ion Television stations also lack locally produced programming; most of its stations had aired newscasts from other local network-affiliated stations until the rebrand as ''i'', and have even produced their own [[Public affairs (broadcasting)|community affairs]] shows; however, local programming has since become virtually non-existent on most of Ion's O&Os and affiliates.\n\nAs a result, there are a small number of stations (such as former affiliate [[WXVO-LD|WKFK-LD]] in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]]) that maintain dual affiliations with both Ion and another smaller network, usually either [[America One]] or MyNetworkTV. In early 2006, it was announced that the ''i'' stations in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] ([[WPXX-TV]]), [[Rapid City, South Dakota]] ([[KKRA-LP]]) and [[Greenville, North Carolina]] ([[WEPX-TV]], as well as its satellite [[WPXU-TV]] in [[Jacksonville, North Carolina]]) would add programming from MyNetworkTV in September 2006, causing preemptions of ''i'' programming during prime time due to the stations' programming commitments to carrying the MyNetworkTV schedule. This blow came after ''i'' lost some affiliates in [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Illinois]] entirely (although the New York station, [[WWBI-LP]] in [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]], subsequently rejoined the network after a sale that resulted in the affiliation change fell through).\n\nIn late September 2009, a year after Ion Media Networks purchased WPXX and WEPX/WPXU from Flinn Broadcasting, those stations resumed carrying Ion Television full-time, having disaffiliated from MyNetworkTV as a result of the network terminating its existing affiliation agreements due to its conversion into a programming service. NBC affiliate [[WITN-TV]] took over the MyNetworkTV affiliation for the Greenville, North Carolina market, placing it on a [[digital subchannel]]; Memphis CW affiliate [[WLMT]], meanwhile, picked up only ''[[WWE SmackDown]]'' in place of WPXX (that station would also add MyNetworkTV on a digital subchannel in a dual affiliation with [[MeTV]], but eventually dropped, leaving it on [[KPMF-LD]], which is licensed to the nearby [[Jonesboro, Arkansas]] market but transmits from the same tower as WLMT does north of Memphis, though it holds no cable coverage in the Memphis area).\n\n==Network slogans==\n* ''Pax TV: A Friend of the Family'' (1998\u20132000)\n* ''Pax TV: Share It With Someone You Love'' (1998\u20132000)\n* ''Pax TV: Share The Wonder'' (2000\u20132002)\n* ''Pax TV: Feel Good TV'' (2002\u20132003)\n* ''Pax TV: Feel The Spirit'' (2003\u20132004)\n* ''Pax TV: Oh What a Night!''
