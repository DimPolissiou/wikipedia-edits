The match took place on 11 April 1970 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] and ended 2\u20132, making it the first FA Cup final to require a [[Replay (sports)|replay]] since [[1912 FA Cup Final|1912]]. The replay was staged at [[Old Trafford]] and played on 29 April; after four hours of fiercely contested football, Chelsea eventually won 2\u20131.  {{as of|2019}}, both the final and replay were the last times that FA Cup final ties were played in April; all subsequent FA Cup final ties have been played in May.\n\nLeeds and Chelsea were two of England's top teams that season, having finished 2nd and 3rd respectively in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. The match marked a clash of [[Chelsea F.C.\u2013Leeds United A.F.C. rivalry|footballing contrasts]]: Chelsea were regarded as \"flamboyant\"<ref>[http://www.blackburncitizen.co.uk/news/1327202.0/ \"I grew up a Chelsea fan\"] Blackburn ''Citizen'', 13 April 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.footballfancast.com/2010/07/football-blogs/chelseas-where-are-they-now \"Chelsea\u2019s where are they now?\"] FootballFanCast.com, 23 July 2010</ref> [[South of England|southerners]], whereas Leeds were seen as uncompromising [[North of England|northerners]]. Neither had won the FA Cup before, though both had recently been runners-up, Leeds in [[1965 FA Cup Final|1965]] and Chelsea in [[1967 FA Cup Final|1967]].\n\nIt was the only time between 1923 and 2000 that an FA Cup Final was played at a stadium other than [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. The replay attracted a British television audience of over 28 million, the second highest UK audience for a sports broadcast (behind the [[1966 World Cup Final]]), and the sixth highest audience for any UK broadcast.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/26/dave-sexton</ref> It has been ranked among the greatest ever FA Cup finals.<ref>[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/2005/05/20/the-20-greatest-fa-cup-finals-of-all-time-115875-15540272/ THE 20 GREATEST FA CUP FINALS OF ALL TIME]</ref>\n\n==Road to Wembley==\n''Home teams listed first.

Towards the end of the first half, Chelsea's [[Peter Houseman]] drove a low shot from {{convert|20|yd}}, which rolled under goalkeeper [[Gary Sprake]]'s body for the equaliser. Leeds appeared to have secured the game six minutes from full-time when an [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]] header hit the post and [[Mick Jones (footballer, born 1945)|Mick Jones]] reacted first to put the ball into the net, but two minutes later [[Ian Hutchinson (footballer born 1948)|Ian Hutchinson]] headed in the equaliser from [[John Hollins]]' cross. There were no more goals scored during the 30-minute extra time and the two squads took a joint lap of honour.\n\nThe Wembley pitch, after the game, was in such dire condition that the Football Association decided to stage the replay at Manchester's Old Trafford stadium.\n\n===Replay at Old Trafford===\nThe replay at [[Old Trafford]], watched by a [[List of most-watched television episodes|television audience]] of 28 million,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37987079|title=Why watching sport on TV is not a black and white issue|author=Bill Wilson|work=BBC News|date=9 December 2016|accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref> a record for an FA Cup final, became one of the most notorious clashes in English football for the harshness of play, which exceeded the previous game at Wembley. The referee in charge of both games, 47-year-old [[Eric Jennings]] from [[Stourbridge]], in his last season as a Football League referee, allowed rough play by both sides throughout, playing the [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)#Advantage|advantage]] to its full extent. He booked only one player, Ian Hutchinson of Chelsea, during the game.\n\nModern-day [[Referee (association football)|referee]] [[David Elleray]] reviewed the match in 1997, and concluded that the sides would have received six [[Misconduct (football)|red cards]] and twenty [[Misconduct (football)|yellow cards]] between them, in the modern era of football.<ref>See \"[https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/worldfootball/clubfootball/01/37/04/28/law12.pdf Interpretation of the Laws of the Game \u2013 Law 12]\" at the [[FIFA]] website</ref>  Tommy Baldwin and Terry Cooper, admittedly two of the quieter men in the two sides, were kicking lumps out of one another, as the battle began. Not long into the game, Chelsea's [[Ron Harris (footballer)|Ron Harris]] caught winger Eddie Gray with a kick to the back of the [[knee]], an action which neutralised the Scottish winger for the rest of the game. [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]] and Ian Hutchinson traded [[punch (strike)|punches]] while Eddie McCreadie, in his own penalty area, made a flying kick to Bremner's head and [[Johnny Giles]] also lunged at a Chelsea opponent. Charlton kneed and [[headbutt]]ed [[Peter Osgood]] while Chelsea's goalkeeper [[Peter Bonetti]] was injured after being bundled into the net by Leeds' Jones, who, minutes later, shot past the limping Bonetti for the opening goal.\n\nChelsea equalised twelve minutes before the end, after a flowing move, from which Osgood scored with a diving header from a [[Charlie Cooke (footballer)|Charlie Cooke]] cross. Jackie Charlton should have been marking Osgood but had 'lost' him while chasing Hutchinson to exact retribution for a [[Charley horse|deadleg]] administered in the Chelsea penalty area a minute or so earlier. In scoring, Osgood became the last player to date to have scored in every round of the FA Cup. With the game ending 1\u20131, the final once again went into [[Extra time#Association football|extra time]]. One minute before the first period of extra time was to end, Chelsea's Hutchinson sent in a long [[throw-in]] that missed almost every player in the [[penalty area]] but came off Charlton's head towards the far post, before being put into the unguarded net by Webb to give Chelsea the lead for the first time in the two games. They kept the lead until the end, securing their first FA Cup win.\n\n==Beyond the final==\nThe two teams, at the time, were praised for their determination and for providing fans and audiences  with two \"splendid games\", but there was also criticism among football professionals and media for the very physical play.<ref>[http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/4075/29/ \"Revie's Leeds were thugs\"], ''[[When Saturday Comes]]'', October 1999</ref> In the modern era, however, the two games are often denoted as \"epic\" and \"iconic\".<ref>[http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/2098/29/ \"Defenders\"], ''[[When Saturday Comes]]'', May 2004</ref>\n\nIn the [[1970\u201371 FA Cup|following season]], neither team would reach the quarter final stage of the Cup. Chelsea were eliminated from the competition in the 4th round, after losing 0\u20133 to [[Manchester City]] at home, while, in the 5th round, Leeds United were upset in a 2\u20133 away defeat by [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] outsiders [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]]. Chelsea, however, went on to reach the [[1971 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|final]] of the [[1970\u201371 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' competition]], played in [[Piraeus]], Greece, at [[Karaiskakis Stadium]], where they faced [[Real Madrid]]. After yet another cup final that went into a replay, the first game ending 1\u20131 and the second one 2\u20131 to Chelsea, the English team won its first European trophy.\nThe Yorkshire side also succeeded in Europe, beating Juventus of Italy in the final Inter Cities Fairs Cup final. The score was 3-3 after completion of the two legs, Leeds winning on the away goals rule after a 2\u20132 draw in Turin. Liverpool had been knocked out by Leeds at the semi-final stage 1-0 on aggregate\n\n==Match details==\n\n===Wembley===\n{{football box\n|date=11 April 1970<br />15:00 [[Western European Summer Time|BST]]\n|team1=[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]\n|score=2\u20132\n|aet=yes\n|team2=[[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]\n|report=[http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1970.htm (Report)]\n|goals1=[[Peter Houseman|Houseman]] {{goal|41}}<br />[[Ian Hutchinson (footballer born 1948)|Hutchinson]] {{goal|86}}\n|goals2=[[Jack Charlton|Charlton]] {{goal|20}}<br />[[Mick Jones (footballer, born 1945)|Jones]] {{goal|84}}\n|stadium=[[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], [[London]]\n|attendance=100,000\n|referee=[[Eric Jennings]] }}\n\n{| width=92% |\n|-\n|{{Football kit\n | pattern_la = \n | pattern_b  =\n | pattern_ra = \n | pattern_sh = _thinwhitesides\n | leftarm    = 0000FF\n | body       = 0000FF\n | rightarm   = 0000FF\n | shorts     = 0000FF\n | socks      = FFFFFF\n | title      = Chelsea\n}}\n|{{Football kit\n | pattern_la = \n | pattern_b  =\n | pattern_ra = \n | leftarm    = FFFFFF\n | body       = FFFFFF\n | rightarm   = FFFFFF\n | shorts     = FFFFFF\n | socks      = EE0000\n | title      = Leeds United\n}}\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top;

The match took place on 11 April 1970 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] and ended 2\u20132, making it the first FA Cup final to require a [[Replay (sports)|replay]] since [[1912 FA Cup Final|1912]]. The replay was staged at [[Old Trafford]] and played on 29 April; after four hours of fiercely contested football, Chelsea eventually won 2\u20131.  {{as of|2019}}, both the final and replay were the last times that FA Cup final ties were played in April; all subsequent FA Cup final ties have been played in May.\n\nLeeds and Chelsea were two of England's top teams that season, having finished 2nd and 3rd respectively in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. The match marked a clash of [[Chelsea F.C.\u2013Leeds United A.F.C. rivalry|footballing contrasts]]: Chelsea were regarded as \"flamboyant\"<ref>[http://www.blackburncitizen.co.uk/news/1327202.0/ \"I grew up a Chelsea fan\"] Blackburn ''Citizen'', 13 April 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.footballfancast.com/2010/07/football-blogs/chelseas-where-are-they-now \"Chelsea\u2019s where are they now?\"] FootballFanCast.com, 23 July 2010</ref> [[South of England|southerners]], whereas Leeds were seen as uncompromising [[North of England|northerners]]. Neither had won the FA Cup before, though both had recently been runners-up, Leeds in [[1965 FA Cup Final|1965]] and Chelsea in [[1967 FA Cup Final|1967]].\n\nIt was the only time between 1923 and 2000 that an FA Cup Final was played at a stadium other than [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. The replay attracted a British television audience of over 28 million, the second highest UK audience for a sports broadcast (behind the [[1966 World Cup Final]]), and the sixth highest audience for any UK broadcast.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/26/dave-sexton</ref> It has been ranked among the greatest ever FA Cup finals.<ref>[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/2005/05/20/the-20-greatest-fa-cup-finals-of-all-time-115875-15540272/ THE 20 GREATEST FA CUP FINALS OF ALL TIME]</ref>\n\n==Road to Wembley==\n''Home teams listed first.

Towards the end of the first half, Chelsea's [[Peter Houseman]] drove a low shot from {{convert|20|yd}}, which rolled under goalkeeper [[Gary Sprake]]'s body for the equaliser. Leeds appeared to have secured the game six minutes from full-time when an [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]] header hit the post and [[Mick Jones (footballer, born 1945)|Mick Jones]] reacted first to put the ball into the net, but two minutes later [[Ian Hutchinson (footballer born 1948)|Ian Hutchinson]] headed in the equaliser from [[John Hollins]]' cross. There were no more goals scored during the 30-minute extra time and the two squads took a joint lap of honour.\n\nThe Wembley pitch, after the game, was in such dire condition that the Football Association decided to stage the replay at Manchester's Old Trafford stadium.\n\n===Replay at Old Trafford===\nThe replay at [[Old Trafford]], watched by a [[List of most-watched television episodes|television audience]] of 28 million,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37987079|title=Why watching sport on TV is not a black and white issue|author=Bill Wilson|work=BBC news|date=9 December 2016|accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref> a record for an FA Cup final, became one of the most notorious clashes in English football for the harshness of play, which exceeded the previous game at Wembley. The referee in charge of both games, 47-year-old [[Eric Jennings]] from [[Stourbridge]], in his last season as a Football League referee, allowed rough play by both sides throughout, playing the [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)#Advantage|advantage]] to its full extent. He booked only one player, Ian Hutchinson of Chelsea, during the game.\n\nModern-day [[Referee (association football)|referee]] [[David Elleray]] reviewed the match in 1997, and concluded that the sides would have received six [[Misconduct (football)|red cards]] and twenty [[Misconduct (football)|yellow cards]] between them, in the modern era of football.<ref>See \"[https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/worldfootball/clubfootball/01/37/04/28/law12.pdf Interpretation of the Laws of the Game \u2013 Law 12]\" at the [[FIFA]] website</ref>  Tommy Baldwin and Terry Cooper, admittedly two of the quieter men in the two sides, were kicking lumps out of one another, as the battle began. Not long into the game, Chelsea's [[Ron Harris (footballer)|Ron Harris]] caught winger Eddie Gray with a kick to the back of the [[knee]], an action which neutralised the Scottish winger for the rest of the game. [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]] and Ian Hutchinson traded [[punch (strike)|punches]] while Eddie McCreadie, in his own penalty area, made a flying kick to Bremner's head and [[Johnny Giles]] also lunged at a Chelsea opponent. Charlton kneed and [[headbutt]]ed [[Peter Osgood]] while Chelsea's goalkeeper [[Peter Bonetti]] was injured after being bundled into the net by Leeds' Jones, who, minutes later, shot past the limping Bonetti for the opening goal.\n\nChelsea equalised twelve minutes before the end, after a flowing move, from which Osgood scored with a diving header from a [[Charlie Cooke (footballer)|Charlie Cooke]] cross. Jackie Charlton should have been marking Osgood but had 'lost' him while chasing Hutchinson to exact retribution for a [[Charley horse|deadleg]] administered in the Chelsea penalty area a minute or so earlier. In scoring, Osgood became the last player to date to have scored in every round of the FA Cup. With the game ending 1\u20131, the final once again went into [[Extra time#Association football|extra time]]. One minute before the first period of extra time was to end, Chelsea's Hutchinson sent in a long [[throw-in]] that missed almost every player in the [[penalty area]] but came off Charlton's head towards the far post, before being put into the unguarded net by Webb to give Chelsea the lead for the first time in the two games. They kept the lead until the end, securing their first FA Cup win.\n\n==Beyond the final==\nThe two teams, at the time, were praised for their determination and for providing fans and audiences  with two \"splendid games\", but there was also criticism among football professionals and media for the very physical play.<ref>[http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/4075/29/ \"Revie's Leeds were thugs\"], ''[[When Saturday Comes]]'', October 1999</ref> In the modern era, however, the two games are often denoted as \"epic\" and \"iconic\".<ref>[http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/2098/29/ \"Defenders\"], ''[[When Saturday Comes]]'', May 2004</ref>\n\nIn the [[1970\u201371 FA Cup|following season]], neither team would reach the quarter final stage of the Cup. Chelsea were eliminated from the competition in the 4th round, after losing 0\u20133 to [[Manchester City]] at home, while, in the 5th round, Leeds United were upset in a 2\u20133 away defeat by [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] outsiders [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]]. Chelsea, however, went on to reach the [[1971 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|final]] of the [[1970\u201371 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' competition]], played in [[Piraeus]], Greece, at [[Karaiskakis Stadium]], where they faced [[Real Madrid]]. After yet another cup final that went into a replay, the first game ending 1\u20131 and the second one 2\u20131 to Chelsea, the English team won its first European trophy.\nThe Yorkshire side also succeeded in Europe, beating Juventus of Italy in the final Inter Cities Fairs Cup final. The score was 3-3 after completion of the two legs, Leeds winning on the away goals rule after a 2\u20132 draw in Turin. Liverpool had been knocked out by Leeds at the semi-final stage 1-0 on aggregate\n\n==Match details==\n\n===Wembley===\n{{football box\n|date=11 April 1970<br />15:00 [[Western European Summer Time|BST]]\n|team1=[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]\n|score=2\u20132\n|aet=yes\n|team2=[[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]\n|report=[http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1970.htm (Report)]\n|goals1=[[Peter Houseman|Houseman]] {{goal|41}}<br />[[Ian Hutchinson (footballer born 1948)|Hutchinson]] {{goal|86}}\n|goals2=[[Jack Charlton|Charlton]] {{goal|20}}<br />[[Mick Jones (footballer, born 1945)|Jones]] {{goal|84}}\n|stadium=[[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], [[London]]\n|attendance=100,000\n|referee=[[Eric Jennings]] }}\n\n{| width=92% |\n|-\n|{{Football kit\n | pattern_la = \n | pattern_b  =\n | pattern_ra = \n | pattern_sh = _thinwhitesides\n | leftarm    = 0000FF\n | body       = 0000FF\n | rightarm   = 0000FF\n | shorts     = 0000FF\n | socks      = FFFFFF\n | title      = Chelsea\n}}\n|{{Football kit\n | pattern_la = \n | pattern_b  =\n | pattern_ra = \n | leftarm    = FFFFFF\n | body       = FFFFFF\n | rightarm   = FFFFFF\n | shorts     = FFFFFF\n | socks      = EE0000\n | title      = Leeds United\n}}\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top;

The formation of the Ancient Grand Lodge brought together lodges and Masons who, believing themselves to be part of an older, original Masonic tradition, had chosen not to ally themselves with the previously formed [[Premier Grand Lodge of England|Moderns Grand Lodge of 1717]].\n\nThe title ''Ahiman Rezon'' has been often said to be of the Hebrew language and variously mean \"to help a brother\", \"will of selected brethren\", \"The secrets of prepared brethren\", \"Royal Builders\" and \"Brother Secretary\". Upon more inspection however the words Ahiman and Rezon are two Biblical figures. Ahiman<ref>1 Chronicles 9:17</ref> was one of four Levite gatekeepers appointed by King David, the others being Shallum, Akkub, and Talmon who guarded the Holy of Holies. Rezon<ref>1 Kings 11:23-25</ref>, a fallen prince, eventually came to lead a group of Marauders to seize Syria where he became king and was constantly entangled in feuds against King Solomon. The reason why Laurence Dermott used it, and what it meant to him, remains a mystery however some have speculated that Dermott chose these names to show exactly how the Ancient Freemasons felt in relation to the Modern Freemasons. Ancients sought to retain a purist form of Freemasonry, which they viewed as being holy. The Modernist sought to change Masonry, and were in the process removing the old ways entirely. Dermott saw the Ancients akin to Ahiman, guarding the Holiest of Holies-Masonry, and likewise to Rezon as his movement (the Ancient Freemasons) were rivaling the Modernist movement, much like Rezon's rivalry with King Solomon who had become unclean in the eyes of the Lord.\nThe ''Ahiman Rezon'' prepared by Smith in 1781, and used by Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, as well as Daicho's edition of 1807, used by the Grand Lodge of Ancient York Masons of South Carolina, are both based on the original text written by Laurence Dermott, which was first published in A.D. 1756 or the year of Masonry A.L. 5756.\n\n==History==\nThe first edition of the ''Ahiman Rezon'' was published in 1756, a second one in 1764. By the time the Ancients and Moderns united in 1813, eight editions had been published. The original edition, written by Laurence Dermott, Grand Secretary of the Ancient Grand Lodge, contains a parody of the histories of Freemasonry such as that in Anderson's 'Constitutions', in which Dermott resolves to write a history of the Craft by purchasing all the previous histories and then throwing them 'under the table'. He then describes a fabled meeting with four 'sojourners from Jerusalem' who were present at the building of Solomon's temple, making them at least two thousand years old, whose 'memories' were possibly failing them. This satire continues the tradition of the Scald Miserable Masons who staged mock processions and disrupted the Grand Lodge's annual procession. Dermott's political purpose in writing the ''Ahiman Rezon'' is revealed in his short history of famous leaders of the ancient world who were of 'mean extraction, that is poor, such as Tamerlane the son of a herdsman, and on the cover which shows the arms of the [[Worshipful Company of Masons]] as well as those of the Freemasons, possibly in an attempt to re-connect Freemasonry to its operative and artisan roots.\n\nThe Grand Lodges of Pennsylvania and South Carolina are the only two jurisdictions in the U.S. that continue to call their Constitution by this name.

The most prominent facility is the landmark [[Hoover Tower]], which is a popular visitor attraction. The tower features an observation deck on the top level that provides visitors with a panoramic view of the Stanford campus and surrounding area. Additionally, the institution has a branch office in the Johnson Center in Washington, DC.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hoover-Tower.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hoover Institution Library and Archives]], Stanford University.]]\nThe Institution was set up by Hoover, a wealthy engineer who was one of Stanford's first graduates. In 1928 he was elected [[President of the United States]]. He had been in charge of major relief efforts in Europe in 1914-1917 in [[Belgium]] and again after the [[First World War|world war]] in central and eastern Europe, especially [[Russia]]. Hoover's plan was to collect and permanently preserve the documents of major events for [[open research]]. Hoover's search team obtained rare printed and unpublished material. They included the papers of activists on the far left and far right, including the files of the ''[[Okhrana]]'' (the [[Tsarist]] secret police).<ref>{{cite journal | last=Duignan | first=Peter | date=2001 | title=The Library of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace.

Supported primarily by gifts from private donors, the Hoover War Collection flourished in its early years. In 1922, the Collection became known as the [[Hoover Institution Library and Archives|Hoover War Library]]. The Hoover War Library was housed in the [[Stanford Library]], separate from the general stacks. By 1926, the Hoover War Library was known as the largest library in the world devoted to the Great War. By 1929, it contained 1.4 million items and was becoming too large to house in the Stanford Library. In 1938, the War Library revealed building plans for [[Hoover Tower]], which was to be its permanent home independent of the Stanford Library system.

At this time, [[Herbert Hoover]] was living in [[New York City]] but remained integrally involved in the Hoover Institution and Library as a benefactor, fundraiser, and consultant.\n\nIn 1956 former President Hoover, under the auspices of the Institution and Library, launched a major fundraising campaign that allowed the Institution to realize its current form as a think tank and archive. In 1957, the Hoover Institution and Library was renamed the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace\u2014the name it holds today.<ref name=\"About Herbert Hoover and the Hoover Institution\">{{cite web |url= http://www.hoover.org/about/timeline |title= Hoover Institution \u2013 Hoover Institution Timeline |work= hoover.org }}</ref>\n\nIn 1960, W.

The library, known as the [[Hoover Institution Library and Archives]], houses multiple archives related to Hoover, World War I, World War II, and other world history.

The most prominent facility is the landmark [[Hoover Tower]], which is a popular visitor attraction. The tower features an observation deck on the top level that provides visitors with a panoramic view of the Stanford campus and surrounding area. Additionally, the institution has a branch office in the Johnson Center in Washington, DC.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hoover-Tower.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hoover Institution Library and Archives]], Stanford University.]]\nThe Institution was set up by Hoover, a wealthy engineer who was one of Stanford's first graduates. In 1928 he was elected [[President of the United States]]. He had been in charge of major relief efforts in Europe in 1914-1917 in [[Belgium]] and again after the [[First World War|world war]] in central and eastern Europe, especially [[Russia]]. Hoover's plan was to collect and permanently preserve the documents of major events for [[open research]]. Hoover's search team obtained rare printed and unpublished material. They included the papers of activists on the far left and far right, including the files of the ''[[Okhrana]]'' (the [[Tsarist]] secret police).<ref>{{cite journal | last=Duignan | first=Peter | date=2001 | title=The Library of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace.

Supported primarily by gifts from private donors, the Hoover War Collection flourished in its early years. In 1922, the Collection became known as the [[Hoover Institution Library and Archives|Hoover War Library]]. The Hoover War Library was housed in the [[Stanford Library]], separate from the general stacks. By 1926, the Hoover War Library was known as the largest library in the world devoted to the Great War. By 1929, it contained 1.4 million items and was becoming too large to house in the Stanford Library. In 1938, the War Library revealed building plans for [[Hoover Tower]], which was to be its permanent home independent of the Stanford Library system.

At this time, [[Herbert Hoover]] was living in [[New York City]] but remained integrally involved in the Hoover Institution and Library as a benefactor, fundraiser, and consultant.\n\nIn 1956 former President Hoover, under the auspices of the Institution and Library, launched a major fundraising campaign that allowed the Institution to realize its current form as a think tank and archive. In 1957, the Hoover Institution and Library was renamed the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace\u2014the name it holds today.<ref name=\"About Herbert Hoover and the Hoover Institution\">{{cite web |url= http://www.hoover.org/about/timeline |title= Hoover Institution \u2013 Hoover Institution Timeline |work= hoover.org }}</ref>\n\nIn 1960, W. Glenn Campbell was appointed director and substantial budget increases soon led to corresponding increases in acquisitions and related research projects. In particular, the Chinese and Russian collections grew considerably. Despite student unrest in the 1960s, the institution continued to thrive and develop closer relations with Stanford.<ref>{{cite book | last=Duignan | first=Peter | date=2001 | title=The Library of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace.

One day, Narada saw, from her abode on the mountain, that Sharada had died, and that giants were fleeing from her body.<ref name=\"Qazi 111\u2013120\" /> In her fury, she summoned them and ordered them to build her a tomb, which became Sharada Peeth.<ref name=\"Qazi 111\u2013120\" /> The second legend says that there one was a giant who loved a princess.<ref name=\"Qazi 111\u2013120\" /> She desired a palace, and so he began work.<ref name=\"Qazi 111\u2013120\" /> At the time of morning [[Adhan|azan]], by which time he was supposed to have finished, the roof remained incomplete, and for that reason, Sharada Peeth today remains without a roof.<ref name=\"Qazi 111\u2013120\" />\n\n===As a \"Shakti Peeth\"===\n{{main|Daksha Yaga}}\n''[[Shakti Peethas]]'' are shrines of Shakti which are said to derive their divinity from the fallen body parts of the goddess [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]], when [[Shiva]] carried it and wandered throughout [[\u0100ry\u0101varta]] in sorrow. There are fifty-one Shakti Peethas, one for each of the fifty-one alphabets in Sanskrit, and each one has shrines for Shakti and [[Kalabhairava]]. Sharada Peeth is one of the 18 [[Shakti Peethas#18 Maha Shakti Pithas|Maha Shakti Peetha]], and is where Sati's right hand is said to have fallen. The form of [[Shakti]] worshipped here is Sharada.\n\n=== Pilgrimage ===\n\nThe Sharada Peeth pilgrimage parallels Shandilya's journey. The act of bathing in the confluence of the Neelum River and Madhumati stream is said to cleanse the pilgrim of their sins.<ref name=\":3\" /> During the Dogra rule, the temple emerged as a regular pilgrimage site for the Kashmiri Pandits. In 1947, Swami Nand Lal Ji of Tikker Kupwara \nmoved the stone idols from Sharda to Tikker, some of which are preserved Devibal in [[Baramulla district|Baramulla]] and in Tikker in [[Kupwara district|Kupwara]].<ref>[https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-pok-muslims-send-sacred-soil-to-kashmiri-pandits-2291214 PoK Muslims send sacred soil to Kashmiri Pandits, Ishfaq-ul-Hassan, jan 11, 2017]</ref>\n\n== Post-Indian independence ==\n\nReligious tourism to Sharada Peeth has declined considerably since the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\u20131948]].

It is a group of countries working together\".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jun/09/william-hague-dismisses-tony-blair-european-union-presidency William Hague dismisses Tony Blair's vision of European Union presidency] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310005013/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/jun/09/william-hague-dismisses-tony-blair-european-union-presidency |date=10 March 2013 }}. ''The Guardian''.</ref>\n\n===Taliban talks===\nIn June 2011, Hague said that Britain helped initiate \"distasteful\" peace talks with the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan. Hague made the comments while on a three-day tour of the country to meet President [[Hamid Karzai]] and visited [[British Army|British troops]]. He told ''The Sun'' newspaper that Britain had led the way in persuading US [[Presidency of Barack Obama|President Barack Obama's administration]] that negotiation was the best potential solution to the conflict. Hague admitted that any deal might mean accepting \"distasteful things\" and could anger military veterans and relatives of the 374 British troops killed in Afghanistan. However, he said he believed that Britain as a whole was \"realistic and practical\" enough to accept that ending fighting and starting talks was the best way to safeguard national security. He told the newspaper: \"An eventual settlement of these issues is the ultimate and most desirable way of safeguarding that national security.\" He added, \"but reconciliation with people who have been in a military conflict can be very distasteful. In all these types of situations, you do have to face up to some distasteful things.\" The previous night US President [[Barack Obama]] told Americans that \"the tide of war is receding\" as he announced plans to withdraw 33,000 US troops from Afghanistan by September 2012.<ref>Bloxham, Andy.

Hague first used the expression when he was Conservative Leader in 1998\u2014and said in an interview with ''The Spectator'' he had been proved right: \"It was folly to create this system. It will be written about for centuries as a kind of historical monument to collective folly. But it's there and we have to deal with it,\" he said. \"I described the Euro as a burning building with no exits and so it has proved for some of the countries in it,\" he further said, adding \"I might take the analogy too far but the Euro wasn't built with exits so it is very difficult to leave it\".<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15098567 \"Euro is a burning building\".] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913223904/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15098567 |date=13 September 2016 }} BBC.

He cited the [[2011 Iran assassination plot]], an attempt to assassinate [[Adel al-Jubeir]], the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, as well as alleged involvement in recent attacks in New Delhi, Georgia, and [[Bangkok]]. He said it showed \"the danger Iran is currently presenting to the peace of the world\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/uk-politics-17089081|work=BBC News|title=Hague warns on Iran 'terrorism'|date=19 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nHague spoke the Commons on 20 February about the [[nuclear program of Iran]] and said that if the Tehran r\u00e9gime managed to construct a viable weapon, its neighbours would be forced to build their own nuclear warheads too. He accused Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] of pursuing \"confrontational policies\" and described the country's enrichment of uranium in defiance of [[United Nations Security Council]] resolutions as \"a crisis coming steadily down the track\". \"Our policy is that whilst we remain unswervingly committed to diplomacy, it is important to emphasise to Iran that all options are on the table\", Hague told MPs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_9698000/9698142.stm |work=BBC News |title=Iran debate part one |date=20 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn March he condemned the way [[2012 Iranian legislative election|parliamentary elections]] were staged, claiming they were not \"free and fair\". He said the poll had been held against a backdrop of fear that meant the result would not reflect the will of the people. Hague said: \"It has been clear for some time that these elections would not be free and fair. \"The r\u00e9gime has presented the vote as a test of loyalty, rather than an opportunity for people freely to choose their own representatives. The climate of fear, created by the r\u00e9gime's crushing of opposition voices since 2009, persists.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/world-news/hague-condemns-elections-in-iran-3038319.html |work=Irish Independent |title=Hague condemns elections in Iran |date=2 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Falkland Islands===\nThe 30th anniversary of the beginning of the [[Falklands War|1982 Falklands War]] was on 2 April 2012. On 29 March, before the [[Lord Mayor of London]]'s banquet guests, namely the entire foreign diplomatic corps of more than 100 ambassadors, including [[Alicia Castro]] ([[Foreign relations of Argentina|Argentinian Ambassador]]), Hague said the UK was keen to deepen its relationship with Latin America\u2014and reiterated Britain's commitment to the Falklands. He said: \"We are reversing Britain\u2019s decline in Latin America, where we are opening a new Embassy in [[El Salvador]]. This determination to deepen our relations with Latin America is coupled with our steadfast commitment to the right of self-determination of the people of the [[Falkland Islands]]\".\n\nTensions over the Falklands had risen in the weeks prior to the anniversary. In February, Hague said deployments of a British warship, [[HMS Dauntless (D33)|HMS ''Dauntless'']] and the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] to the Falklands were \"entirely routine\". Hague said that Britain affirmed the Falklanders' [[self-determination]] and would seek to prevent [[Argentina]] from \"raising the diplomatic temperature\" over the issue. He further said: \"(the events) are not so much celebrations as commemorations. I think Argentina will also be holding commemorations of those who died in the conflict. Since both countries will be doing that I don't think there is anything provocative about that.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/southamerica/argentina/9174278/William-Hague-tells-Argentina-we-will-steadfastly-defend-Falklands.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Christopher |last=Hope |title=William Hague tells Argentina 'we will steadfastly defend Falklands' |date=29 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Turks and Caicos Islands===\nHague set out [[Her Majesty's Government]] plans, on 12 June 2012, for the [[2012 Turks and Caicos Islands general election|reintroduction of self-government]] in the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], where direct rule of the [[Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands|Governor]] had been in place since the islands had been subject to corruption and maladministration under the previous autonomous administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-statement-announces-elections-in-the-turks-and-caicos-islands|title=Announcement: Foreign Secretary statement announces elections in the Turks and Caicos Islands|website=www.gov.uk|date=12 June 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Julian Assange and right of asylum===\nIn August 2012, Hague declared that [[Julian Assange]], the [[WikiLeaks|WikiLeaks organisation]] founder, would not be granted [[political asylum]] by the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news |title=Julian Assange asylum: Britain will not give safe passage, says William Hague&nbsp;\u2013 video |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2012/aug/17/julian-assange-asylum-william-hague-video |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref> Hague declared the UK's willingness to extradite Assange to the Swedish authorities who had requested his extradition; thus [[Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority|Swedish prosecutors]], unwilling to break [[diplomatic protocol]], have deferred from interrogating Assange at the [[Embassy of Ecuador, London|Embassy of Ecuador]], London.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/13/julian-assange-wikileaks-swedish-prosecutors-london-interview www.theguardian.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828073436/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/13/julian-assange-wikileaks-swedish-prosecutors-london-interview |date=28 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\nHague confirmed the [[British Government]]'s position \u2013 that it is lawfully obliged to extradite Julian Assange. \"We're disappointed by the statement by [[Ricardo Pati\u00f1o|Ecuador's Foreign Minister]] today that [[Government of Ecuador|Ecuador]] has offered political asylum to Julian Assange.

Hague made clear his view after Blair argued that a directly-elected President of Europe, representing almost 400m people from 27 countries, would give the EU clear leadership and enormous authority. In an interview with ''[[The Times]]'', Blair set out the agenda that he thought a directly-elected [[EU President]] should pursue, although he conceded, there was \"no chance\" of such a post being created \"at the present time\".

Hague made the comments while on a three-day tour of the country to meet President [[Hamid Karzai]] and visited [[British Army|British troops]]. He told ''The Sun'' newspaper that Britain had led the way in persuading US [[Presidency of Barack Obama|President Barack Obama's administration]] that negotiation was the best potential solution to the conflict. Hague admitted that any deal might mean accepting \"distasteful things\" and could anger military veterans and relatives of the 374 British troops killed in Afghanistan. However, he said he believed that Britain as a whole was \"realistic and practical\" enough to accept that ending fighting and starting talks was the best way to safeguard national security. He told the newspaper: \"An eventual settlement of these issues is the ultimate and most desirable way of safeguarding that national security.\" He added, \"but reconciliation with people who have been in a military conflict can be very distasteful. In all these types of situations, you do have to face up to some distasteful things.\" The previous night US President [[Barack Obama]] told Americans that \"the tide of war is receding\" as he announced plans to withdraw 33,000 US troops from Afghanistan by September 2012.<ref>Bloxham, Andy.

It will be written about for centuries as a kind of historical monument to collective folly. But it's there and we have to deal with it,\" he said. \"I described the Euro as a burning building with no exits and so it has proved for some of the countries in it,\" he further said, adding \"I might take the analogy too far but the Euro wasn't built with exits so it is very difficult to leave it\".<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15098567 \"Euro is a burning building\".] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913223904/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15098567 |date=13 September 2016 }} BBC.

On 29 March, before the [[Lord Mayor of London]]'s banquet guests, namely the entire foreign diplomatic corps of more than 100 ambassadors, including [[Alicia Castro]] ([[Foreign relations of Argentina|Argentinian Ambassador]]), Hague said the UK was keen to deepen its relationship with Latin America\u2014and reiterated Britain's commitment to the Falklands. He said: \"We are reversing Britain\u2019s decline in Latin America, where we are opening a new Embassy in [[El Salvador]]. This determination to deepen our relations with Latin America is coupled with our steadfast commitment to the right of self-determination of the people of the [[Falkland Islands]]\".\n\nTensions over the Falklands had risen in the weeks prior to the anniversary. In February, Hague said deployments of a British warship, [[HMS Dauntless (D33)|HMS ''Dauntless'']] and the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] to the Falklands were \"entirely routine\". Hague said that Britain affirmed the Falklanders' [[self-determination]] and would seek to prevent [[Argentina]] from \"raising the diplomatic temperature\" over the issue. He further said: \"(the events) are not so much celebrations as commemorations. I think Argentina will also be holding commemorations of those who died in the conflict.

=\n}}\n{{2019\u20132020 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests}}\n\nThe '''2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests''' were triggered by the introduction of [[2019 Hong Kong extradition bill|the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill]] by the [[Hong Kong government]].<ref name=\"bbc_49317695\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190213_trojanhorse\" /> Had it been enacted, the bill would have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|legal system of Mainland China]], thereby undermining [[One country, two systems|the region's autonomy]] and people's civil liberties,<ref name=\"reuters_20190524_eudiplomaticnote\" /><ref name=\"eji_20190523\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190522_chrispatten\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" />  and infringe on privacy and [[Freedom of speech by country|freedom of speech]] laws. As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and for the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]].<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9 June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12 June 2019,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police, who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June 2019, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12 June 2019.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1 July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> The police's inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21 July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31 August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1 October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4 September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede on the other four demands. Claiming to curb further protests, Lam invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] on 4 October 2019 to implement an [[anti-mask law]], to counterproductive effect.<ref name=\"rthk_1484040\" /> As the protests dragged on, confrontations escalated as both sides became increasingly violent.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014, which began after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]] which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered to represent Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's [[Hong Kong Basic Law|basic law]], in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored 6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02 points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was also only scored 3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism, this was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and scoring lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries.

With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, and along with it the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media has noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nThe unaffordability of housing prices was also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> This is because, unlike the comparable [[city-state]] of Singapore, Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population.<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> That is due to the fact that since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have largely been ruled by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> That has also meant a few powerful families having significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /> Furthermore, a significant amount of the local government's revenue is made from land sales to developers.<ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" />\n\n== Objectives ==\nInitially, protesters solely demanded the withdrawal of the extradition bill. Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12 June, the objective of the protesters has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced indefinite suspension of the bill on 15 June, reading on it may be quickly resumed. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. The bill was formally withdrawn on 23 October.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12 June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12 June protest. Through the government's characterization of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12 June, specifically those against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]]''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15 March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31 March 2019 and another on 28 April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while the IPCC chairman [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nThe police modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1 October confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any of the disciplinary measure to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequence; as of 24 December 2019, no police have been charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial total statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales have declined and consumers' appetite for spending has decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies for goods were also halted and obstructed due to the protest. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns. Various countries have since issued travel warnings to Hong Kong.<ref name=\"bbc_49276259\"/>\n\n===Effects on society===\n[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] received criticisms for its performance during the protests. Carrie Lam's perceived arrogance,<ref name=\"standardhk_129761\"/> her extended absence, reluctance to engage in dialogue with protesters, and subpar performance at press conferences,<ref name=\"ft_20190830_policefurious\"/> were believed to have enabled the protests to escalate.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190707_missingleader\"/> At a press conference on 5 August, Lam explained her absence from the public eye in the preceding two weeks by the risks for organisers regarding possible disruption of public events and press conferences by protesters.<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> According to polls conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, Lam's approval ratings declined to 22.3 in October, lowest among all chief executives, and her performance was categorised as \"disastrous\" alongside [[Secretary for Security]] [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] and [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Teresa Cheng (politician)|Teresa Cheng]], prompting institute director [[Robert Chung]] to describe the situation as \"dire\".<ref name=\"hkfp_20191009_ratingplunges\"/> [[Ma Ngok]], a political scientist, remarked that the government \"has lost the trust of a whole generation\" and predicted that the youths would remain angry at both the government and the police \"for years to come\".<ref name=\"guardian_20190811_lacktrust\"/> According to ''[[The Diplomat]]'', there was also the emergence of the concept of \"mutually assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts within the government were also formed with Lennon Walls being set up in government offices and civil servants organising rallies.<ref name=\"scmp_3020206\"/>\n\n[[File:P1120823 (49001440122).jpg|thumb|left|A riot police officer held up a blue flag warning the protesters

name=\"standardhk_132961\"/> In October, a survey conducted by CUHK revealed that more than 50% of the respondents were deeply dissatisfied with the police's performance.<ref name=\"independent_9158061\"/> According to some reports, the police's aggressive behaviours and tactics have caused them to become a symbol that represented hostility and suppression and police's actions on the protesters has resulted in a breakdown of citizens' trust towards the police.<ref name=\"aljazeera_191101070008742\"/><ref name=\"atlantic_597205\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20180628_lostgoodwill\"/> Citizens were also concerned about the police's ability to regulate and control itself and feared about its abuse of power.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons\"/> The suspected acts of police brutality have turned some politically neutral citizens to become more sympathetic with the young protesters.<ref name=\"wsj_11567458226\"/> Fearing Hong Kong changing into a [[police state]], some citizens were actively considering emigration.<ref name=\"cnn_20191008_hkleave\"/> For the police, some lower-ranking officers reported feeling \"lost and confused\", citing \"a lack of leadership\" during important moments,<ref name=\"reuters_20190717_underpressure\"/> and was reportedly discontent with the government, as its extended absence left the police to be the only group to clash with the protesters, resulting in the two groups developing immense mutual hatred for each other.<ref name=\"ft_20190830_policefurious\"/> The police has cancelled foot patrol due to fear that they may be attacked,<ref name=\"scmp_3025140\"/> and issued extendable batons to off-duty officers.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons\"/> Frontline officers and protesters have insulted each other with degradative terms.<ref name=\"wp_20191104_insultsdangerous\"/><ref name=\"coconutshk_20190826\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3025159\"/> Police officers also reported being \"physically and mentally\" tired, as they faced the risks of being [[doxed]], [[cyberbullying|cyberbullied]], and distanced by their family members.<ref name=\"cnn_20190815_policeside\"/> The police's relations with journalists,<ref name=\"scmp_3017673\"/> social workers,<ref

strained.\n\nTo cope with the ongoing protests, on 15 November 2019, the police had appointed no more than 100 [[Correctional Services Department]] officers as special constables to assist the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3038039\"/> Due to internal redeployment of staff within the force to deal with the protests, anti-crime operations were \"smaller and less frequent than in the past\".

However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

Offenders amendment bill]] by the [[Hong Kong government]].<ref name=\"bbc_49317695\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190213_trojanhorse\" /> Had it been enacted, the bill would have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|legal system of Mainland China]], thereby

name=\"hkfp_20190522_chrispatten\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" />  and infringe on privacy and [[Freedom of speech by country|freedom of speech]] laws. As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and for the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]].<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9 June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12 June 2019,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police, who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June 2019, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12 June 2019.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1 July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> The police's inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21 July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31 August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1 October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4 September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede on the other four demands. Claiming to curb further protests, Lam invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] on 4 October 2019 to implement an [[anti-mask law]], to counterproductive effect.<ref name=\"rthk_1484040\" /> As the protests dragged on, confrontations escalated as both sides became increasingly violent.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014, which began after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]] which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered to represent Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's [[Hong Kong Basic Law|basic law]], in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored 6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02 points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was also only scored 3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism, this was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and scoring lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries.

With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, and along with it the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media has noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nThe unaffordability of housing prices was also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> This is because, unlike the comparable [[city-state]] of Singapore, Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population.<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> That is due to the fact that since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have largely been ruled by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> That has also meant a few powerful families having significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /> Furthermore, a significant amount of the local government's revenue is made from land sales to developers.<ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" />\n\n== Objectives ==\nInitially, protesters solely demanded the withdrawal of the extradition bill. Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12 June, the objective of the protesters has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced indefinite suspension of the bill on 15 June, reading on it may be quickly resumed. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. The bill was formally withdrawn on 23 October.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12 June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12 June protest. Through the government's characterization of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12 June, specifically those against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]]''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15 March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31 March 2019 and another on 28 April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while the IPCC chairman [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nThe police modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1 October confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any of the disciplinary measure to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequence; as of 24 December 2019, no police have been charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial total statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales have declined and consumers' appetite for spending has decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies for goods were also halted and obstructed due to the protest. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns. Various countries have since issued travel warnings to Hong Kong.<ref name=\"bbc_49276259\"/>\n\n===Effects on society===\n[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] received criticisms for its performance during the protests. Carrie Lam's perceived arrogance,<ref name=\"standardhk_129761\"/> her extended absence, reluctance to engage in dialogue with protesters, and subpar performance at press conferences,<ref name=\"ft_20190830_policefurious\"/> were believed to have enabled the protests to escalate.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190707_missingleader\"/> At a press conference on 5 August, Lam explained her absence from the public eye in the preceding two weeks by the risks for organisers regarding possible disruption of public events and press conferences by protesters.<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> According to polls conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, Lam's approval ratings declined to 22.3 in October, lowest among all chief executives, and her performance was categorised as \"disastrous\" alongside [[Secretary for Security]] [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] and [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Teresa Cheng (politician)|Teresa Cheng]], prompting institute director [[Robert Chung]] to describe the situation as \"dire\".<ref name=\"hkfp_20191009_ratingplunges\"/> [[Ma Ngok]], a political scientist, remarked that the government \"has lost the trust of a whole generation\" and predicted that the youths would remain angry at both the government and the police \"for years to come\".<ref name=\"guardian_20190811_lacktrust\"/> According to ''[[The Diplomat]]'', there was also the emergence of the concept of \"mutually assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts within the government were also formed with Lennon Walls being set up in government offices and civil servants organising rallies.<ref name=\"scmp_3020206\"/>\n\n[[File:P1120823 (49001440122).jpg|thumb|left|A riot police officer held up a blue flag warning the protesters

name=\"standardhk_132961\"/> In October, a survey conducted by CUHK revealed that more than 50% of the respondents were deeply dissatisfied with the police's performance.<ref name=\"independent_9158061\"/> According to some reports, the police's aggressive behaviours and tactics have caused them to become a symbol that represented hostility and suppression and police's actions on the protesters has resulted in a breakdown of citizens' trust towards the police.<ref name=\"aljazeera_191101070008742\"/><ref name=\"atlantic_597205\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20180628_lostgoodwill\"/> Citizens were also concerned about the police's ability to regulate and control itself and feared about its abuse of power.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons\"/> The suspected acts of police brutality have turned some politically neutral citizens to become more sympathetic with the young protesters.<ref name=\"wsj_11567458226\"/> Fearing Hong Kong changing into a [[police state]], some citizens were actively considering emigration.<ref name=\"cnn_20191008_hkleave\"/> For the police, some lower-ranking officers reported feeling \"lost and confused\", citing \"a lack of leadership\" during important moments,<ref name=\"reuters_20190717_underpressure\"/> and was reportedly discontent with the government, as its extended absence left the police to be the only group to clash with the protesters, resulting in the two groups developing immense mutual hatred for each other.<ref name=\"ft_20190830_policefurious\"/> The police has cancelled foot patrol due to fear that they may be attacked,<ref name=\"scmp_3025140\"/> and issued extendable batons to off-duty officers.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons\"/> Frontline officers and protesters have insulted each other with degradative terms.<ref name=\"wp_20191104_insultsdangerous\"/><ref name=\"coconutshk_20190826\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3025159\"/> Police officers also reported being \"physically and mentally\" tired, as they faced the risks of being [[doxed]], [[cyberbullying|cyberbullied]], and distanced by their family members.<ref name=\"cnn_20190815_policeside\"/> The police's relations with journalists,<ref name=\"scmp_3017673\"/> social workers,<ref

strained.\n\nTo cope with the ongoing protests, on 15 November 2019, the police had appointed no more than 100 [[Correctional Services Department]] officers as special constables to assist the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3038039\"/> Due to internal redeployment of staff within the force to deal with the protests, anti-crime operations were \"smaller and less frequent than in the past\".

However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

The vessel, along with [[sister ship]] {{MS|Island Princess|2003|2}}, was launched in 2002.  ''Coral Princess'' and ''Island Princess'' are part of the only five [[Panamax]] ships operated by Princess Cruises.\n\n==Route==\nDuring summer months, ''Coral Princess''{{'}}s main itinerary consists of 7-day Alaskan cruises from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Alaska]], US. During fall, winter and spring, ''Coral Princess'' runs 11-day [[Panama Canal]] partial-transit cruises with stops in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], [[Colon, Panama]], either [[Ocho Rios, Jamaica]], or [[Grand Cayman]] (alternating cruises), [[Limon, Costa Rica]], and [[Oranjestad, Aruba]], with [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], as its turnaround port.\n\n==Accidents and Incidents==\nOn May 2, 2013, ''Coral Princess'' suffered a fire when some flammable material in the engineering spaces accidentally ignited in the middle of the night.  It was quickly extinguished without anyone onboard being injured; however, minor amounts of smoke was detected by passengers as far up as Deck 8.\n\nOn the same cruise, a mini-suite stateroom on Deck 9 was flooded when the in-room sprinkler was set off by a passenger hanging garments from the sprinkler head.  The room had to be evacuated and completely refurbished due to water damage.\n\n''Coral Princess'' experienced an engine fire at approximately 2130 local time on 15 January 2020 while in the [[Drake Passage]] en route to [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], [[Falkland Islands]]. At the time of the fire, ''Coral Princess'' was {{convert|4|nmi}} north of [[Elephant Island]] in [[Antarctica]]. The ship had just completed a two-day transit of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] when the fire occurred and was contained by the ship's on-board fire detection system; no passengers or crew were injured.\n\n===COVID-19 pandemic===\n{{main|2020 coronavirus pandemic on cruise ships#Zaandam}}\nNews reports in early April 2020 indicated that the ship, with 1,020 passengers and 878 crew, with some suffering flu-like symptoms, was hoping to be allowed to dock at [[Port Everglades]] in [[Fort Lauderdale]], Florida to allow passengers to disembark. A news item on 2 April 2020 stated that \"Passengers have been confined to their rooms...when the company noticed a higher than normal number of flu-like cases on board\".  Reports then specified that that \"out of 13 passengers and crew tested for COVID-19 on board the Coral Princess, 12 were positive\". Officials in [[Broward County, Florida]] said that a plan was not yet in place to handle the situation. The ship had departed [[San Antonio, Chile]] on 5 March 2020, when the cruise line was still in full operation, and was not allowed to disembark passengers at [[Buenos Aires]] on 19 and 20 March.

''Coral Princess'' and ''Island Princess'' are part of the only five [[Panamax]] ships operated by Princess Cruises.\n\n==Route==\nDuring summer months, ''Coral Princess''{{'}}s main itinerary consists of 7-day Alaskan cruises from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Alaska]], US. During fall, winter and spring, ''Coral Princess'' runs 11-day [[Panama Canal]] partial-transit cruises with stops in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], [[Colon, Panama]], either [[Ocho Rios, Jamaica]], or [[Grand Cayman]] (alternating cruises), [[Limon, Costa Rica]], and [[Oranjestad, Aruba]], with [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], as its turnaround port.\n\n==Accidents and Incidents==\nOn May 2, 2013, ''Coral Princess'' suffered a fire when some flammable material in the engineering spaces accidentally ignited in the middle of the night.  It was quickly extinguished without anyone onboard being injured; however, minor amounts of smoke was detected by passengers as far up as Deck 8.\n\nOn the same cruise, a mini-suite stateroom on Deck 9 was flooded when the in-room sprinkler was set off by a passenger hanging garments from the sprinkler head.  The room had to be evacuated and completely refurbished due to water damage.\n\n''Coral Princess'' experienced an engine fire at approximately 2130 local time on 15 January 2020 while in the [[Drake Passage]] en route to [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], [[Falkland Islands]]. At the time of the fire, ''Coral Princess'' was {{convert|4|nmi}} north of [[Elephant Island]] in [[Antarctica]]. The ship had just completed a two-day transit of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] when the fire occurred and was contained by the ship's on-board fire detection system; no passengers or crew were injured.\n\n===COVID-19 pandemic===\n{{main|2020 coronavirus pandemic on cruise ships#Zaandam}}\nNews reports in early April 2020 indicated that the ship, with 1,020 passengers and 878 crew, with some suffering flu-like symptoms, was hoping to be allowed to dock at [[Port Everglades]] in [[Fort Lauderdale]], Florida to allow passengers to disembark. A news item on 2 April 2020 stated that \"Passengers have been confined to their rooms...when the company noticed a higher than normal number of flu-like cases on board\".  Reports then specified that that \"out of 13 passengers and crew tested for COVID-19 on board the Coral Princess, 12 were positive\". Officials in [[Broward County, Florida]] said that a plan was not yet in place to handle the situation. The ship had departed [[San Antonio, Chile]] on 5 March 2020, when the cruise line was still in full operation, and was not allowed to disembark passengers at [[Buenos Aires]] on 19 and 20 March. Passengers were in full lockdown as the vessel approached Florida.  <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cruisehive.com/princess-cruise-ship-with-12-covid-19-cases-hopes-to-dock-in-fort-lauderdale/38822 |title=Princess Cruise Ship With 12 COVID-19 Cases Hopes to Dock in Fort Lauderdale |work=Cruise Hive |date=3 April 2020 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/coral-princess-cruise-ship-12-183437177.html |title=Coral Princess cruise ship with 12 COVID-19 cases on board hopes to dock in Florida |work=Yahoo, Miami Herald |date=2 April 2020 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nA previous ship, the [[MS Zaandam]], also with COVD-19 cases, had finally received permission on 2 April for most of her passengers to disembark.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cruise-ship-sick-passengers-sister-ship-will-be-allowed-dock-n1174796 |title=Cruise ship with sick passengers and sister ship will be allowed to dock in Florida |last=Burke |first=Minyvonne |work=NBC News |date=2 April 2020 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.princess.com/ships/co/index.html Official website]\n* {{commons category inline|IMO 9229659}}\n\n{{Princess Ships}}\n\n[[Category:2002 ships]]\n[[Category:Cruise ships]]\n[[Category:Panamax cruise ships]]\n[[Category:Ships built by Chantiers de l'Atlantique]]\n[[Category:Ships of Princess Cruises]]\n\n\n{{cruise-ship-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Peter K Burian", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCOVID-19 pandemic", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Princess"}
